00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
lob or something I just have a giant pit

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.429 
lob or something I just have a giant pit
right<00:01:03.030> there<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.329> kill<00:01:03.480> them<00:01:03.600> but<00:01:04.080> let's<00:01:04.290> just

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
right there to kill them but let's just

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.840 
right there to kill them but let's just
our<00:01:04.589> build<00:01:04.769> these<00:01:04.890> things<00:01:05.040> very<00:01:05.339> easy<00:01:05.580> build

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
our build these things very easy build

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.219 
our build these things very easy build
so<00:01:05.939> we're<00:01:06.060> gonna<00:01:06.150> do<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.420> survival<00:01:06.900> version

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
so we're gonna do the survival version

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.960 
so we're gonna do the survival version
first<00:01:07.409> because<00:01:07.710> we<00:01:07.799> actually<00:01:08.010> need<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.610> certain

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
first because we actually need a certain

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.910 
first because we actually need a certain
amount<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.210> resources<00:01:09.630> for<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.680> for<00:01:10.860> the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
amount of resources for that so for the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.620 
amount of resources for that so for the
survival<00:01:11.310> version<00:01:11.670> we're<00:01:11.790> going<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.090> need<00:01:12.210> two

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
survival version we're going to need two

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.899 
survival version we're going to need two
sticky<00:01:12.960> pistons<00:01:13.350> two<00:01:13.710> pressure<00:01:14.010> plates<00:01:14.310> four

this on your creative world which you
can't<00:05:21.710> dig<00:05:21.950> down<00:05:22.100> like<00:05:22.280> sixty-five<00:05:22.729> blocks

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
can't dig down like sixty-five blocks

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.880 
can't dig down like sixty-five blocks
like<00:05:23.270> mine<00:05:23.479> you're<00:05:24.110> you<00:05:24.380> might<00:05:24.530> as<00:05:24.620> well<00:05:24.680> just

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:24.890 
like mine you're you might as well just

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:26.650 
like mine you're you might as well just
put<00:05:25.010> lava<00:05:25.370> in<00:05:25.640> there<00:05:25.850> but<00:05:26.240> if<00:05:26.330> you're<00:05:26.390> doing<00:05:26.570> it

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
put lava in there but if you're doing it

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.300 
put lava in there but if you're doing it
on<00:05:26.840> a<00:05:26.870> creative<00:05:27.290> world<00:05:27.470> that<00:05:27.620> isn't<00:05:27.979> a<00:05:28.040> flat

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
on a creative world that isn't a flat

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:29.860 
on a creative world that isn't a flat
lands<00:05:28.520> and<00:05:28.760> you<00:05:28.820> should<00:05:29.000> be<00:05:29.150> absolutely<00:05:29.750> fine

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
lands and you should be absolutely fine

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.020 
lands and you should be absolutely fine
so<00:05:30.470> I<00:05:30.830> usually<00:05:31.160> I<00:05:31.220> usually<00:05:31.580> just<00:05:31.700> dig<00:05:31.880> down

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030 
so I usually I usually just dig down

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.460 
so I usually I usually just dig down
like<00:05:32.240> this<00:05:32.419> on<00:05:32.660> my<00:05:32.780> flat<00:05:33.080> OH

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
like this on my flat OH

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.110 
like this on my flat OH
cuz<00:05:34.040> if<00:05:34.190> I<00:05:34.310> mean<00:05:34.490> if<00:05:34.610> you<00:05:34.669> have<00:05:34.760> the<00:05:34.850> LA<00:05:35.060> but
