this sound big big sound way above his
head<00:01:16.110> playing<00:01:16.440> that<00:01:17.010> was<00:01:17.190> the<00:01:17.340> full<00:01:17.520> MOA<00:01:17.700> at

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
head playing that was the full MOA at

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.450 
head playing that was the full MOA at
its<00:01:18.060> best<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.480> Jeanne<00:01:19.050> Cooper<00:01:19.290> was<00:01:19.980> a<00:01:20.010> student

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
its best and Jeanne Cooper was a student

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.060 
its best and Jeanne Cooper was a student
of<00:01:20.700> Sanford<00:01:20.970> molar<00:01:21.770> incredible<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.920> this

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
of Sanford molar incredible that this

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.710 
of Sanford molar incredible that this
technique<00:01:23.460> goes<00:01:23.940> back<00:01:24.210> right<00:01:24.480> to<00:01:24.630> the

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
technique goes back right to the

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.480 
technique goes back right to the
beginning<00:01:25.080> when<00:01:25.470> Cooper<00:01:25.740> broke<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.310> ice<00:01:26.460> and

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
beginning when Cooper broke the ice and

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.760 
beginning when Cooper broke the ice and
introduced<00:01:27.150> all<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:27.450> great<00:01:27.720> playing<00:01:27.990> so

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
introduced all this great playing so

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.480 
introduced all this great playing so
here<00:01:28.890> we<00:01:28.980> go<00:01:29.100> now

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
here we go now

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.100 
here we go now
dramatic<00:01:30.150> positions<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:30.659> now<00:01:30.810> what<00:01:30.990> we're

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
dramatic positions so now what we're

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.810 
dramatic positions so now what we're
going<00:01:31.260> on<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.980> chart<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.550> goes<00:01:33.030> from<00:01:33.330> Germanic

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
going on the chart it goes from Germanic

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.780 
going on the chart it goes from Germanic
informal<00:01:35.820> full<00:01:36.680> informal<00:01:37.680> meaning<00:01:37.980> molar<00:01:38.520> and

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
informal full informal meaning molar and

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.280 
informal full informal meaning molar and
of<00:01:38.880> course<00:01:39.120> full<00:01:39.330> being<00:01:39.570> your<00:01:39.720> higher<00:01:39.870> stroke

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
of course full being your higher stroke

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.560 
of course full being your higher stroke
so<00:01:40.830> if<00:01:40.890> i<00:01:40.979> go<00:01:41.130> down<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.340> germanic<00:01:41.820> position<00:01:42.240> and

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
so if i go down to germanic position and

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.750 
so if i go down to germanic position and
i<00:01:42.720> begin<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.050> play<00:01:43.290> this<00:01:43.440> molar<00:01:43.740> stroke<00:01:44.130> at<00:01:44.520> its

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
i begin to play this molar stroke at its

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.820 
i begin to play this molar stroke at its
highest<00:01:44.940> level<00:01:45.390> it's<00:01:45.510> full<00:01:45.750> stroke<00:01:46.020> it's<00:01:46.530> this

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
highest level it's full stroke it's this

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.060 
highest level it's full stroke it's this
slow<00:01:47.190> motion<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.790> come<00:01:48.360> up<00:01:48.570> elbow<00:01:49.350> goes<00:01:49.590> up<00:01:49.830> and

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
slow motion I come up elbow goes up and

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.180 
slow motion I come up elbow goes up and
it<00:01:50.490> goes<00:01:50.520> way<00:01:51.150> above<00:01:51.180> my<00:01:51.810> head<00:01:52.110> in<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.830> highest

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
it goes way above my head in the highest

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.300 
it goes way above my head in the highest
arc<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.670> my<00:01:53.820> arm<00:01:54.140> used<00:01:55.140> as<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.620> entire<00:01:55.979> whip

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
arc of my arm used as the entire whip

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
arc of my arm used as the entire whip
again<00:01:57.060> slow<00:01:57.420> motion<00:01:57.840> it's<00:01:58.320> this<00:01:58.680> above<00:01:59.549> above

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
again slow motion it's this above above

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
in 1984 I showed this to Kenny Aronoff

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:31.789 
in 1984 I showed this to Kenny Aronoff
he<00:02:29.280> is<00:02:29.430> my<00:02:29.640> best<00:02:30.060> example<00:02:30.840> of<00:02:30.959> demonstrating

he is my best example of demonstrating

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.679 
he is my best example of demonstrating
the<00:02:31.890> full<00:02:32.129> molar<00:02:32.370> stroke<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:32.939> I<00:02:33.269> always<00:02:33.450> say

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:33.689 
the full molar stroke and I always say

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:35.270 
the full molar stroke and I always say
the<00:02:33.840> full<00:02:33.989> molar<00:02:34.230> stroke<00:02:34.530> is<00:02:34.709> more<00:02:35.129> of<00:02:35.219> a

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
the full molar stroke is more of a

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.289 
the full molar stroke is more of a
calisthenics<00:02:35.939> stroke

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
calisthenics stroke

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:37.910 
calisthenics stroke

your toolbox up it's incredible

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:48.979 
your toolbox up it's incredible
you'll<00:03:47.940> probably<00:03:48.150> also<00:03:48.359> have<00:03:48.659> to<00:03:48.780> use

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
you'll probably also have to use

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.569 
you'll probably also have to use

playing more powerful you want a bigger

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:55.640 
playing more powerful you want a bigger
stick<00:03:54.209> to<00:03:54.329> take<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:54.659> shock<00:03:54.900> of<00:03:55.079> what<00:03:55.199> it<00:03:55.319> is<00:03:55.379> I
