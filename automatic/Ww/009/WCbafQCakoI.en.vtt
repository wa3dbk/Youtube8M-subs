00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.500
Are we going?

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.560
No!

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.000
Novel by MATIJA SEVER

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.480
Ivan, it's me... Miren!

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.620
What happened here?

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:28.880
Robbers.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.380
It is time I find my on way.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.020
Directed by LUKA FRIŠČIĆ

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.960
My name is Ivan. I am looking for a group of bandits so that I can bring them to justice.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.740
Their leader is called Veles.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.860
Morana?

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.020
Are you following me?

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.220
Not at all.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.820
I see my name is very well known.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.000
I am Ljudevit, lord of Siscia.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.140
You are the best thing that this winter brought under my roof.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.960
Report.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.640
A man can not be recovering for half of winter just because of one wolf bite to the shoulder.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.480
I may be a Christian, but I know what resides in the Slavic night.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.360
Poison, the cider is poisoned!

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.040
Greeks, Romans, Germanic people. They all whish to conquer us.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.200
You are nothing more than a time remnant. A relic, just like me.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.000
We have to adjust to the novelties or perish!

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.540
Just how many enemies with bad luck have been destroyed because of your anger?

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.020
One too little.
