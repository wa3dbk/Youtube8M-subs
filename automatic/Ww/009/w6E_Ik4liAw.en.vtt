the<00:01:08.740> language<00:01:09.460> on<00:01:09.759> the<00:01:09.819> packaging<00:01:10.390> this<00:01:10.899> one

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
the language on the packaging this one

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.529 
the language on the packaging this one
has<00:01:11.229> some<00:01:11.590> broken<00:01:11.950> English<00:01:12.310> on<00:01:12.459> it<00:01:12.610> it<00:01:13.420> was

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:13.539 
has some broken English on it it was

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:15.389 
has some broken English on it it was
quite<00:01:13.720> difficult<00:01:13.899> to<00:01:14.170> figure<00:01:14.649> out<00:01:14.800> the<00:01:14.950> dosing

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
quite difficult to figure out the dosing

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:18.029 
quite difficult to figure out the dosing
so<00:01:15.729> I<00:01:15.759> use<00:01:16.119> the<00:01:16.300> little<00:01:16.390> bits<00:01:16.690> of<00:01:16.840> my<00:01:17.170> intuition

00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:18.039 
so I use the little bits of my intuition

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:20.460 
so I use the little bits of my intuition
on<00:01:18.640> what<00:01:18.910> these<00:01:19.030> product<00:01:19.420> would<00:01:19.539> do<00:01:19.720> now

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
on what these product would do now

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.990 
on what these product would do now
firstly<00:01:21.039> we're<00:01:21.250> going<00:01:21.280> to<00:01:21.490> be<00:01:21.550> looking<00:01:21.759> at<00:01:21.849> the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
firstly we're going to be looking at the

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.589 
firstly we're going to be looking at the
snowflake

00:01:22.589 --> 00:01:22.599 
snowflake

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:24.180 
snowflake
now<00:01:22.690> the<00:01:22.750> packaging<00:01:23.200> is<00:01:23.289> absolutely<00:01:23.800> stunning

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
now the packaging is absolutely stunning

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.650 
now the packaging is absolutely stunning
I<00:01:24.310> like<00:01:24.610> the<00:01:24.789> fact<00:01:24.970> that<00:01:25.060> they've<00:01:25.300> actually

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:25.660 
I like the fact that they've actually

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.630 
I like the fact that they've actually
been<00:01:26.410> a<00:01:26.470> little<00:01:26.890> bit<00:01:26.979> Brown<00:01:27.099> packaging<00:01:27.550> it

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
been a little bit Brown packaging it

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.639 
been a little bit Brown packaging it
just<00:01:27.819> looks<00:01:28.000> nicer<00:01:28.209> and<00:01:28.869> I<00:01:28.959> know<00:01:29.020> that<00:01:29.319> doesn't

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
just looks nicer and I know that doesn't

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:31.350 
just looks nicer and I know that doesn't
really<00:01:29.770> make<00:01:29.979> a<00:01:30.009> difference<00:01:30.099> but<00:01:30.640> attention

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
really make a difference but attention

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.480 
really make a difference but attention
to<00:01:31.599> detail<00:01:31.959> generally<00:01:32.530> tells<00:01:33.039> me<00:01:33.220> that<00:01:33.369> the

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
to detail generally tells me that the

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.609 
to detail generally tells me that the
manufacturer<00:01:34.060> cares<00:01:34.390> about<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:35.319> products

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
manufacturer cares about the products

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:36.300 
manufacturer cares about the products
that<00:01:35.709> they<00:01:35.830> sell

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
that they sell

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.130 
that they sell
now<00:01:36.910> the<00:01:36.970> snowflake<00:01:37.390> is<00:01:37.539> a<00:01:37.569> standard

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
now the snowflake is a standard

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.900 
now the snowflake is a standard
snowflake<00:01:38.619> and<00:01:39.160> as<00:01:39.250> you<00:01:39.399> would<00:01:39.520> have<00:01:39.610> seen<00:01:39.759> in

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
snowflake and as you would have seen in

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.930 
snowflake and as you would have seen in
my<00:01:40.030> videos<00:01:40.360> on<00:01:40.509> my<00:01:40.539> Sora<00:01:40.869> grades<00:01:41.940> it's

you about is that adding a pellet this

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.870 
you about is that adding a pellet this
size<00:02:10.929> is<00:02:11.530> way<00:02:11.770> too<00:02:11.830> much<00:02:12.220> for<00:02:12.459> the<00:02:12.550> general

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
size is way too much for the general

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.240 
size is way too much for the general
tank<00:02:13.120> take<00:02:13.719> a<00:02:13.750> millimeter<00:02:14.290> to<00:02:14.409> millimeters<00:02:15.069> of

tank take a millimeter to millimeters of

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.280 
tank take a millimeter to millimeters of
this<00:02:15.519> and<00:02:15.760> you're<00:02:16.000> sure

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
this and you're sure

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.720 
this and you're sure
actually<00:02:16.650> be<00:02:16.769> fine<00:02:17.040> they're<00:02:17.250> looking<00:02:17.459> for

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
actually be fine they're looking for

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.390 
actually be fine they're looking for
days<00:02:17.909> the<00:02:18.900> reason<00:02:19.200> for<00:02:19.349> this<00:02:19.439> being<00:02:19.500> is<00:02:19.950> at

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
days the reason for this being is at

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.580 
days the reason for this being is at
this<00:02:20.579> expense<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.420> it<00:02:21.510> actually<00:02:21.840> forms<00:02:22.379> the

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
this expense and it actually forms the

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.470 
this expense and it actually forms the
wafers<00:02:23.099> that<00:02:23.129> fall<00:02:23.519> all<00:02:23.760> over<00:02:23.790> your<00:02:24.150> tank<00:02:24.390> so

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
wafers that fall all over your tank so

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.149 
wafers that fall all over your tank so
all<00:02:25.049> those<00:02:25.260> pictures<00:02:25.590> that<00:02:25.620> you<00:02:25.859> see<00:02:26.010> online

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
all those pictures that you see online

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:27.949 
all those pictures that you see online
with<00:02:26.579> the<00:02:26.790> massive<00:02:27.120> amounts<00:02:27.480> of<00:02:27.540> wafers

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
with the massive amounts of wafers

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.080 
with the massive amounts of wafers
generally<00:02:28.560> stick<00:02:28.799> like<00:02:28.980> this<00:02:29.129> and<00:02:29.819> it<00:02:29.939> will

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
generally stick like this and it will

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.429 
generally stick like this and it will
actually<00:02:30.629> remove<00:02:31.560> your<00:02:31.769> tank<00:02:31.980> or<00:02:33.319> alter<00:02:34.319> your

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:34.439 
actually remove your tank or alter your

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.679 
actually remove your tank or alter your
water<00:02:34.650> parameters<00:02:34.890> so<00:02:35.569> from<00:02:36.569> that

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:36.689 
water parameters so from that

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.599 
water parameters so from that
perspective<00:02:36.840> this<00:02:37.739> is<00:02:37.799> a<00:02:37.950> great<00:02:38.159> snowflake

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
perspective this is a great snowflake

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:40.190 
perspective this is a great snowflake
food<00:02:38.849> there's<00:02:39.239> nothing<00:02:39.599> really<00:02:39.780> wrong<00:02:39.900> with

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
food there's nothing really wrong with

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.330 
food there's nothing really wrong with
that<00:02:40.319> you<00:02:40.439> can't<00:02:40.709> go<00:02:40.859> wrong<00:02:41.069> with<00:02:41.250> this

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
that you can't go wrong with this

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.520 
that you can't go wrong with this
particular<00:02:41.730> product<00:02:42.030> but<00:02:42.780> it<00:02:42.930> costs<00:02:43.349> you<00:02:43.500> a

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
particular product but it costs you a

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.199 
particular product but it costs you a
fraction<00:02:44.010> of<00:02:44.129> the<00:02:44.220> price<00:02:44.340> of<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:45.000> bigger

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
fraction of the price of the bigger

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.569 
fraction of the price of the bigger
players<00:02:45.450> so<00:02:45.840> from<00:02:46.560> a<00:02:46.590> snowflake<00:02:46.980> perspective

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
players so from a snowflake perspective

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:48.949 
players so from a snowflake perspective
that's<00:02:47.849> probably<00:02:48.090> one<00:02:48.299> of<00:02:48.329> the<00:02:48.480> best<00:02:48.629> products

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
that's probably one of the best products

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.360 
that's probably one of the best products
that<00:02:49.049> you're<00:02:49.170> going<00:02:49.200> to<00:02:49.349> buy<00:02:49.560> in<00:02:49.829> North

translates<00:03:04.829> it<00:03:04.950> into<00:03:05.010> English<00:03:05.430> so<00:03:05.459> I<00:03:05.669> can

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:05.939 
translates it into English so I can

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:08.330 
translates it into English so I can
actually<00:03:06.120> read<00:03:06.450> some<00:03:06.689> of<00:03:06.720> it<00:03:06.919> and<00:03:07.919> I<00:03:08.069> have<00:03:08.220> to

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
actually read some of it and I have to

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.589 
actually read some of it and I have to
say<00:03:08.489> the<00:03:08.579> packaging<00:03:08.760> wasn't<00:03:09.269> really<00:03:09.419> done

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
say the packaging wasn't really done

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.179 
say the packaging wasn't really done
well<00:03:09.750> on<00:03:09.930> this<00:03:10.049> particular<00:03:10.409> one<00:03:10.709> because<00:03:10.739> then

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:11.189 
well on this particular one because then

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:13.129 
well on this particular one because then
they'd<00:03:11.340> actually<00:03:11.519> broke<00:03:11.849> on<00:03:12.030> this<00:03:12.150> but<00:03:12.510> when

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
they'd actually broke on this but when

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:14.360 
they'd actually broke on this but when
you<00:03:13.230> open<00:03:13.379> it<00:03:13.650> up<00:03:13.799> you're<00:03:14.010> actually

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
you open it up you're actually

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.800 
you open it up you're actually
pleasantly<00:03:14.790> surprised<00:03:15.180> by<00:03:15.359> the<00:03:15.419> fact<00:03:15.720> that

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
pleasantly surprised by the fact that

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.399
