a great one it would work similar to

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.679 
a great one it would work similar to
when<00:01:23.070> you're<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.280> champion<00:01:23.790> on<00:01:24.000> universe<00:01:24.390> mode

during<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.780> title<00:01:28.049> matches<00:01:28.310> so<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.460> will<00:01:29.520> be

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
during the title matches so it will be

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.130 
during the title matches so it will be
the<00:01:29.729> same<00:01:29.909> kind<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.180> springing<00:01:30.420> here<00:01:30.659> for<00:01:30.869> mr.

svr<00:02:13.830> 2094<00:02:14.760> we<00:02:15.060> which<00:02:15.810> I<00:02:16.020> didn't<00:02:16.320> actually<00:02:16.380> play

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
svr 2094 we which I didn't actually play

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.770 
svr 2094 we which I didn't actually play
so<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:17.100> didn't<00:02:17.340> know<00:02:17.430> about<00:02:17.580> but<00:02:18.420> now<00:02:18.570> I<00:02:18.600> know

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
so I didn't know about but now I know

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.240 
so I didn't know about but now I know
they<00:02:19.110> were<00:02:19.170> including<00:02:19.740> the<00:02:19.860> wii<00:02:20.010> version

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
they were including the wii version

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.150 
they were including the wii version
maybe<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.510> inclusion<00:02:22.110> of<00:02:22.200> thumbtacks<00:02:22.470> in<00:02:22.950> the

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
maybe the inclusion of thumbtacks in the

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.400 
maybe the inclusion of thumbtacks in the
upcoming<00:02:23.280> game<00:02:23.760> wouldn't<00:02:24.420> necessarily<00:02:24.540> be<00:02:25.200> as

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
upcoming game wouldn't necessarily be as

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.250 
upcoming game wouldn't necessarily be as
hard<00:02:25.740> as<00:02:26.100> I<00:02:26.400> thought<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.730> would<00:02:26.760> be<00:02:27.000> i<00:02:27.270> think<00:02:27.870> in

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
hard as I thought it would be i think in

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.290 
hard as I thought it would be i think in
svn<00:02:28.830> she<00:02:28.920> was<00:02:29.070> in<00:02:29.190> line<00:02:29.370> they<00:02:30.030> are<00:02:30.090> actually

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
svn she was in line they are actually

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.570 
svn she was in line they are actually
hidden<00:02:30.750> under<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.140> steel<00:02:31.410> steps<00:02:31.710> so<00:02:32.430> that's

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
hidden under the steel steps so that's

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.130 
hidden under the steel steps so that's
kind<00:02:32.820> of<00:02:32.880> cool<00:02:33.150> I<00:02:33.360> would<00:02:33.570> definitely<00:02:33.750> be

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
kind of cool I would definitely be

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.540 
kind of cool I would definitely be
awesome<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.710> have<00:02:34.740> that<00:02:34.950> back<00:02:35.100> in<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.310> game

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
awesome to have that back in the game

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.570 
awesome to have that back in the game
let's<00:02:36.390> be<00:02:36.660> honest<00:02:37.020> as<00:02:37.200> awesome<00:02:37.830> as<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.040> might<00:02:38.370> be

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
let's be honest as awesome as I might be

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.780 
let's be honest as awesome as I might be

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
I still can't sit happenin but hey it

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.840 
I still can't sit happenin but hey it
happens<00:02:42.000> I'll<00:02:42.390> be<00:02:42.660> very<00:02:43.050> very<00:02:43.170> pleased

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
happens I'll be very very pleased

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.370 
happens I'll be very very pleased
another<00:02:44.850> good<00:02:45.030> one<00:02:45.240> and<00:02:45.450> realistic<00:02:46.110> one<00:02:46.230> as

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
another good one and realistic one as

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.770 
another good one and realistic one as
well<00:02:46.500> was<00:02:46.830> he<00:02:47.010> trash<00:02:47.400> can<00:02:47.700> lid<00:02:47.940> so<00:02:48.750> it

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
well was he trash can lid so it

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.480 
well was he trash can lid so it
obviously<00:02:49.020> already<00:02:49.650> got<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:49.920> trash<00:02:50.160> can<00:02:50.400> in

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
obviously already got the trash can in

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.730 
obviously already got the trash can in
the<00:02:50.550> game<00:02:50.760> so<00:02:51.510> it<00:02:51.690> makes<00:02:51.870> sense<00:02:52.020> to<00:02:52.500> actually

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
the game so it makes sense to actually

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.190 
the game so it makes sense to actually
have<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.280> lid<00:02:53.460> as<00:02:53.610> well<00:02:53.790> maybe<00:02:54.690> they<00:02:54.870> can<00:02:55.050> make

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
have the lid as well maybe they can make

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.770 
have the lid as well maybe they can make
it<00:02:55.350> work<00:02:55.530> so<00:02:56.010> when<00:02:56.160> you<00:02:56.250> select<00:02:56.460> the<00:02:57.060> trash<00:02:57.420> can

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
it work so when you select the trash can

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.690 
it work so when you select the trash can
as<00:02:57.960> the<00:02:58.200> weapon<00:02:58.350> of<00:02:58.560> choice<00:02:58.740> from<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.430> weapons

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
as the weapon of choice from the weapons

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.760 
as the weapon of choice from the weapons
wheel<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.390> trash<00:03:00.600> can<00:03:00.990> comes<00:03:01.350> out<00:03:01.560> over<00:03:01.710> the

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
wheel the trash can comes out over the

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.890 
wheel the trash can comes out over the
lid<00:03:01.920> on<00:03:02.040> top<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:02.490> then<00:03:02.970> maybe<00:03:03.390> it<00:03:03.450> goes<00:03:03.660> into

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
lid on top and then maybe it goes into

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.900 
lid on top and then maybe it goes into
to<00:03:04.140> several<00:03:04.470> weapons<00:03:04.620> I'll<00:03:05.280> be<00:03:05.520> kind<00:03:05.730> of<00:03:05.760> cool

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
to several weapons I'll be kind of cool

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.790 
to several weapons I'll be kind of cool
and<00:03:06.300> there<00:03:06.750> are<00:03:06.840> a<00:03:06.870> lot<00:03:06.990> more<00:03:07.020> great<00:03:07.320> ideas<00:03:07.440> as

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
and there are a lot more great ideas as

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.550 
and there are a lot more great ideas as
well<00:03:07.950> like<00:03:08.610> a<00:03:08.640> metal<00:03:09.000> pipe<00:03:09.210> crowbar<00:03:10.020> a<00:03:10.170> steel

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
well like a metal pipe crowbar a steel

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.130 
well like a metal pipe crowbar a steel
chair<00:03:10.590> wrapped<00:03:11.130> in<00:03:11.340> barbed<00:03:11.610> wire<00:03:12.140> especially

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
chair wrapped in barbed wire especially

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.830 
chair wrapped in barbed wire especially
like<00:03:13.320> that<00:03:13.500> one<00:03:13.680> all<00:03:14.460> of<00:03:14.700> these<00:03:14.850> ideas<00:03:15.180> will<00:03:15.690> be

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
like that one all of these ideas will be

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.150 
like that one all of these ideas will be
great<00:03:16.110> to<00:03:16.140> have<00:03:16.440> are<00:03:16.740> the<00:03:16.860> ones<00:03:16.890> I<00:03:17.130> just

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
great to have are the ones I just

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.070 
great to have are the ones I just
mentioned<00:03:17.310> there<00:03:17.760> we're<00:03:18.330> probably<00:03:18.630> fairly

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
mentioned there we're probably fairly

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.830 
mentioned there we're probably fairly
simple<00:03:19.650> to<00:03:19.710> implement<00:03:20.070> in<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.520> game<00:03:20.760> as<00:03:20.970> a<00:03:21.570> lot

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
simple to implement in the game as a lot

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.960 
simple to implement in the game as a lot
of<00:03:21.930> them<00:03:22.080> we<00:03:22.620> have<00:03:22.830> the<00:03:22.980> same<00:03:23.010> animation<00:03:23.580> as

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
of them we have the same animation as

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.210 
of them we have the same animation as
your<00:03:24.210> animations<00:03:24.780> currently<00:03:25.200> in<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.350> game<00:03:25.560> so

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
your animations currently in the game so

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.310 
your animations currently in the game so
it<00:03:26.280> wouldn't<00:03:26.610> be<00:03:26.760> too<00:03:27.240> hard<00:03:27.270> to<00:03:27.630> add<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.110> game

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
it wouldn't be too hard to add the game

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.590 
it wouldn't be too hard to add the game
they<00:03:28.500> really<00:03:28.740> wanted<00:03:28.920> to<00:03:29.150> but<00:03:30.150> you<00:03:30.330> guys
