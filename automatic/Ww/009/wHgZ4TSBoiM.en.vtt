00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.820

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.970
 good question what to give but 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.970
 I have a question to you and indeed 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.930
 so the revision begins again 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:31.380
 We should have done well 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:34.229

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.970
 the chancellor he would have to point de 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.030
 also under rtl now 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.680
 de is achievable says everything what one 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.140
 over granted and know his audience 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.840
 So it really has to be us now 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.960
 are just really people who write with 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.790
 endo wm I have to because I do not head 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.010
 picks up what has become the people 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.780
 really embarrassing exactly that just describes 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.000
 rtl managed to hate this love 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.220
 people a mathematical died suddenly 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.830
 he had not expected that or 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:07.450
 21 ye are actually Disabled 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:11.700
 sometimes you feel that shows here 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:15.430
 about such a mathematical one 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.030
 mathematician suddenly got up with it 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.030
 he did not expect 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:27.990
 the politician died the one mathematician 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.990
 suddenly he did not expect that 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.310
 [Music] 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.900
 [Music] 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.400
 That's how I imagine it with you 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.840
 what does a blind man say in a suzuki? 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.280
 is not quite enough because you do 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.220
 Do not be silly and funny 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:04.390
 Rather, it says what stinks the fish 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:07.000
 and rand joschi keep it up with mobbing it 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.170
 It's not about it you should really 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.390
 no jokes and now was without 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.400
 chance for the people who might be me 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.140
 it's always too loud to know 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.360
 so I always that I really 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.950
 not meant like that but if you look at that 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:23.920
 ears then looks study that proved 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:26.260
 nine out of ten people really over 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.030
 no shit that is really only one 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.040
 is fun and it really is not 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.270
 easy until the people I take mega for 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.590
 the thing with humor I take too 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.480
 Foreigners will humor me me 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.920
 Aliens themselves are often so that some 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.450
 People just do not find it funny 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.130
 or find it all right 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.420
 prefer to that it's just fun 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.470
 never so I somehow 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:47.260
 racist when he is like boys like gps 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:51.730
 has a door five because you will too 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:54.330
 no bones has plenty of what he thinks 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.330
 at the moment 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:01.780
 there is a real narrow ridge 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:03.940
 between extremely funny and blender and 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.709
 tries to hold you just once people 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.660

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.610
 against disabled I only have it against 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.570

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.680
 what i noticed as other youtubers 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.180

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.250

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.739

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:26.530
 also with the actually for spectators 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.760
