00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.470 
it's just gonna be a silver color kind
of<00:02:21.490> thinking<00:02:21.849> though<00:02:22.030> if<00:02:22.209> it's<00:02:22.330> a

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
of thinking though if it's a

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.960 
of thinking though if it's a
silver-colored<00:02:23.260> energy<00:02:23.650> drink<00:02:23.950> maybe<00:02:24.700> you

silver-colored energy drink maybe you

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.580 
silver-colored energy drink maybe you
really<00:02:25.270> shouldn't<00:02:25.540> be<00:02:25.630> drinking<00:02:25.810> it<00:02:26.140> it

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
sounds like something that would be all

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.420 
sounds like something that would be all
that<00:02:27.970> healthy<00:02:28.180> for<00:02:28.510> you<00:02:29.130> nothing<00:02:30.130> energy

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
that healthy for you nothing energy
