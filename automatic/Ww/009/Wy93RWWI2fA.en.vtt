00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
in fact the life support your unit we

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.160 
in fact the life support your unit we
need<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:26.010> travel<00:00:26.279> into<00:00:26.609> space<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:27.330> as<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.050> can

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
need to travel into space and as you can

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.810 
need to travel into space and as you can
see<00:00:28.199> here<00:00:28.470> it's<00:00:28.650> Durasteel<00:00:29.010> tech<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:29.580> you<00:00:29.640> need

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
see here it's Durasteel tech so you need

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.370 
see here it's Durasteel tech so you need
to<00:00:29.910> have<00:00:30.060> access<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.599> tourists<00:00:30.990> steel<00:00:31.140> bars

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
to have access to tourists steel bars

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.490 
to have access to tourists steel bars
and<00:00:32.149> then<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.210> just<00:00:33.360> need<00:00:33.510> 20<00:00:33.630> doors<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.230> bars

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
and then you just need 20 doors to bars

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.580 
and then you just need 20 doors to bars
and<00:00:34.880> 1000<00:00:35.880> pixels<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.300> make<00:00:36.450> this<00:00:36.630> if<00:00:37.050> you

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
and 1000 pixels to make this if you

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.020 
and 1000 pixels to make this if you
carry<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:37.950> on<00:00:38.100> your<00:00:38.250> back<00:00:38.370> in<00:00:38.550> your<00:00:38.670> active

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
carry this on your back in your active

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.180 
carry this on your back in your active
back<00:00:39.210> slot<00:00:39.390> item<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:40.320> will<00:00:40.469> be<00:00:40.590> able<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:41.010> go<00:00:41.129> to

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
back slot item you will be able to go to

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.150 
back slot item you will be able to go to
asteroids<00:00:41.899> so<00:00:42.899> you're<00:00:43.110> now<00:00:43.200> on<00:00:43.440> asteroids<00:00:44.010> in

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
asteroids so you're now on asteroids in

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.520 
asteroids so you're now on asteroids in
space<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.789> yeah<00:00:45.390> that's<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.379> how<00:00:46.500> you

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
space and yeah that's that is how you

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.959 
space and yeah that's that is how you
actually<00:00:46.770> travel<00:00:47.250> in<00:00:47.340> space<00:00:47.430> that's<00:00:47.789> how<00:00:47.910> you

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
actually travel in space that's how you

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.150 
actually travel in space that's how you
now<00:00:48.239> survive<00:00:48.600> on<00:00:48.750> moons<00:00:48.960> if<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.829> don't<00:00:50.010> have

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
now survive on moons if you don't have

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.770 
now survive on moons if you don't have
this<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.460> believe<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:50.879> even<00:00:51.059> suffocate<00:00:51.750> on

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
this I believe you even suffocate on

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.630 
this I believe you even suffocate on
moons<00:00:52.110> as<00:00:52.289> well<00:00:52.469> now<00:00:52.649> because<00:00:53.190> moons<00:00:53.430> are

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
moons as well now because moons are

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.850 
moons as well now because moons are
technically<00:00:54.270> in<00:00:54.510> space<00:00:54.780> aren't<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.469> my

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
technically in space aren't a and my

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.229 
technically in space aren't a and my
character<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.280> starving<00:00:56.760> but<00:00:56.910> that's

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
character is starving but that's

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.049 
character is starving but that's
something<00:00:57.660> entirely<00:00:58.109> different<00:00:58.440> yeah<00:00:59.399> this

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
something entirely different yeah this

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.819 
something entirely different yeah this
is<00:01:00.270> how<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.449> actually<00:01:00.660> go<00:01:00.960> into<00:01:01.469> space<00:01:01.770> and

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
is how you actually go into space and

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.460 
is how you actually go into space and
survive<00:01:02.340> it's<00:01:02.910> quite<00:01:03.120> easy<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.840> simply<00:01:04.140> make

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
survive it's quite easy you simply make

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.140 
survive it's quite easy you simply make
the<00:01:04.500> life<00:01:04.920> support<00:01:05.100> unit<00:01:05.519> I'm<00:01:05.640> gonna<00:01:05.790> call<00:01:06.000> the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
the life support unit I'm gonna call the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.820 
the life support unit I'm gonna call the
life<00:01:06.299> support<00:01:06.450> unit<00:01:06.869> by<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.020> way<00:01:07.170> because<00:01:07.710> it

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
life support unit by the way because it

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.300 
life support unit by the way because it
doesn't<00:01:08.070> really<00:01:08.189> have<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:09.680> proper<00:01:10.680> name<00:01:10.950> yet<00:01:11.189> it

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
doesn't really have a proper name yet it

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.359 
doesn't really have a proper name yet it
doesn't<00:01:11.490> really<00:01:11.700> have<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:11.970> clear<00:01:12.330> name<00:01:12.570> yet<00:01:12.780> and

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
doesn't really have a clear name yet and

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.530 
doesn't really have a clear name yet and
about<00:01:14.369> asteroids<00:01:14.880> by<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.090> way<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.210> just<00:01:15.270> want

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
about asteroids by the way I just want

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.270 
about asteroids by the way I just want
to<00:01:15.600> drop<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.780> quick<00:01:15.990> word<00:01:16.200> if<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.799> fall<00:01:16.979> off<00:01:17.159> an

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
to drop a quick word if you fall off an

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.100 
to drop a quick word if you fall off an
asteroid<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.700> will<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.360> will<00:01:18.450> die<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.990> will

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
asteroid you will you will die you will

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.260 
asteroid you will you will die you will
die<00:01:19.170> horribly<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.549> let<00:01:20.700> me<00:01:20.729> actually<00:01:20.820> my<00:01:21.000> my

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
die horribly so let me actually my my

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.270 
die horribly so let me actually my my
way<00:01:21.420> off<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:22.320> basically<00:01:22.650> if<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.890> fall<00:01:23.070> into

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
way off so basically if you fall into

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.920 
way off so basically if you fall into
the<00:01:23.490> depths<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.820> space<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.720> die

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
the depths of space you you die

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.679 
the depths of space you you die
instantly<00:01:25.470> it's<00:01:25.740> pretty<00:01:26.670> crazy<00:01:26.939> but<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.540> does

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
instantly it's pretty crazy but it does

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.300 
instantly it's pretty crazy but it does
somewhat<00:01:28.170> make<00:01:28.290> sense<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.619> guess<00:01:28.650> we<00:01:29.100> just<00:01:29.130> have

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
somewhat make sense I guess we just have

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.100 
somewhat make sense I guess we just have
to<00:01:29.490> get<00:01:29.579> down<00:01:29.790> there<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.210> believe<00:01:30.659> we're<00:01:30.930> close

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
to get down there I believe we're close

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.950 
to get down there I believe we're close
now<00:01:31.140> oh<00:01:31.560> okay<00:01:32.369> oh<00:01:32.610> okay<00:01:32.670> it's<00:01:33.420> loading<00:01:33.600> don't

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
now oh okay oh okay it's loading don't

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.690 
now oh okay oh okay it's loading don't
