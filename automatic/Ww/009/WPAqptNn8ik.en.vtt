00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:35.040 

you<00:02:29.260> know<00:02:29.349> I<00:02:29.379> mean<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:34.360> only<00:02:34.510> thing<00:02:34.660> I<00:02:34.989> can

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
you know I mean the only thing I can

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.630 
you know I mean the only thing I can
think<00:02:35.260> of<00:02:35.709> is<00:02:36.010> their<00:02:36.489> markers<00:02:38.640> territorial

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
think of is their markers territorial

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.789 
think of is their markers territorial
markers<00:02:41.819> in<00:02:42.819> teepees<00:02:43.450> all<00:02:43.780> they<00:02:44.260> all<00:02:44.410> have<00:02:44.620> the

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
markers in teepees all they all have the

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:50.280 
markers in teepees all they all have the
same<00:02:45.010> basic<00:02:45.580> design<00:02:46.290> yeah<00:02:48.690> some<00:02:49.690> of<00:02:49.720> them<00:02:50.019> are

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
same basic design yeah some of them are

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.960 
same basic design yeah some of them are
a<00:02:50.319> little<00:02:50.650> different<00:02:50.920> work<00:02:51.340> with<00:02:51.610> each<00:02:51.760> other

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
a little different work with each other

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.500 
a little different work with each other
yeah<00:02:53.430> well<00:02:54.430> they<00:02:54.579> do<00:02:54.640> have<00:02:54.760> their<00:02:54.910> differences

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
yeah well they do have their differences

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.030 
yeah well they do have their differences
but<00:02:57.480> well<00:02:58.480> I<00:02:58.569> could<00:02:58.780> said<00:02:58.989> I<00:02:59.019> think<00:02:59.380> maybe<00:02:59.739> they

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
but well I could said I think maybe they

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.569 
but well I could said I think maybe they
make<00:03:00.310> them<00:03:00.549> as<00:03:00.730> a<00:03:00.790> visual<00:03:01.410> marker<00:03:02.410> and<00:03:03.340> then

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
make them as a visual marker and then

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:09.780 
make them as a visual marker and then
they<00:03:03.760> leave<00:03:04.660> their<00:03:04.930> scent<00:03:05.260> on<00:03:05.799> the<00:03:05.950> inside<00:03:08.790> so

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
they leave their scent on the inside so

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.120 
they leave their scent on the inside so
that<00:03:10.030> you<00:03:10.510> know<00:03:10.569> another<00:03:10.900> Bigfoot<00:03:11.200> come<00:03:11.739> along

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
that you know another Bigfoot come along

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:38.270 
that you know another Bigfoot come along
can<00:03:12.420> say<00:03:13.420> all

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:46.510 

plenty<00:03:38.880> of<00:03:38.940> water

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:52.930 

might<00:03:47.150> be<00:03:47.390> a<00:03:47.420> good<00:03:50.410> showing<00:03:51.410> of<00:03:52.130> how<00:03:52.460> they<00:03:52.700> use

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
might be a good showing of how they use

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.200 
might be a good showing of how they use
thickets<00:03:54.100> see<00:03:55.100> how<00:03:55.190> the<00:03:55.250> trees<00:03:55.610> are<00:03:55.790> all<00:03:55.910> in<00:03:56.120> a

thickets see how the trees are all in a

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:02.050 
thickets see how the trees are all in a
circle<00:03:56.600> and<00:03:58.180> then<00:03:59.180> the<00:03:59.390> inside<00:04:00.080> is<00:04:01.060> basically

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
circle and then the inside is basically

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.830 
circle and then the inside is basically
cleared<00:04:02.360> out<00:04:03.310> well<00:04:04.310> one<00:04:04.550> of<00:04:04.640> the<00:04:04.840> monster

how they did it you find a thicket and
create<00:04:16.549> an<00:04:16.700> entrance<00:04:17.510> and<00:04:18.250> then<00:04:19.660> kind<00:04:20.660> of

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
create an entrance and then kind of

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:32.740 
create an entrance and then kind of
hollow<00:04:20.959> this<00:04:21.200> place<00:04:22.190> out<00:04:31.210> that's<00:04:32.210> what<00:04:32.570> this

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
hollow this place out that's what this

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:49.010 
hollow this place out that's what this
almost<00:04:33.110> looks<00:04:33.260> like

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:05:06.559 

I<00:05:04.250> would<00:05:05.250> also<00:05:05.370> make<00:05:05.669> a<00:05:05.729> very<00:05:06.090> good<00:05:06.150> guard

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:06.569 
I would also make a very good guard

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:09.860 
I would also make a very good guard
station<00:05:08.120> where<00:05:09.120> they<00:05:09.150> could<00:05:09.419> sit<00:05:09.599> there<00:05:09.780> and

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
station where they could sit there and

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.800 
station where they could sit there and
wash<00:05:10.080> down<00:05:10.729> where<00:05:11.729> the<00:05:11.940> humans<00:05:12.360> would<00:05:12.569> come

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
wash down where the humans would come

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:18.080 
wash down where the humans would come
from<00:05:13.250> and<00:05:14.250> then<00:05:15.050> disappear<00:05:16.050> out<00:05:16.080> the<00:05:16.409> back<00:05:17.090> if

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
from and then disappear out the back if

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:27.230 
from and then disappear out the back if
