00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.960
 hello to all the techno friends 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.860
 welcome to this focus dedicated to 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:20.970
 benchmarks related to the galaxy note device 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:25.650
 2 we start as usual with the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.330
 standard quadrant and as we launch the 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.680
 quadrant I remind you that what they are 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.119
 the hardware features of this 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.030
 terminal 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.579
 the galaxy notes two currently perhaps the 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:40.290
 most powerful terminal present on the 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:46.700
 market to a quad core exynos chip from 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:49.440
 1.6 ghz one gpu arm mali 400mp 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.360
 slightly overclocked compared to 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.460
 itself is heavier than the galaxy s ii 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.050
 for example in the galaxy note ma has been 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.190
 slightly less drops compared to 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.969
 those present in the terms and in the 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:05.519
 passed to well 2 gb of ram really one 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:08.279
 huge amount and let's say this is it 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.159
 definitely the terminal of the moment in 

00:01:08.279 --> 00:01:13.529
 terms of performance 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.499
 let's see then how it behaves in the 

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:23.670
 standard team is almost finished now 

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:28.049
 here we are, the score is 6,000 53 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.990
 points I hope you can see it 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:34.289
 really a very very high score 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.329
 the highest in the used terminals we say 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:39.899
 as a term of comparison within the 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:44.759
 then we go to a standard dial 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:48.229
 run the antutu benchmark you see 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.039
 here I have already had the opportunity to launch in 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.209
 past 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:53.209
 let's say it again 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:26.099
 well the score achieved by the grax in 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:28.980
 2d 13.542 a really good score 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:31.349
 let's see how it compares with others 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.910
 terminals that the highest scores are 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.830
 around 16 thousand however have been 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.500
 made with terminals crossed let's say 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:41.040
 this craxi night two is in version 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.599
 standard and compared to others 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.450
 standard version we see that the 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:48.750
 score is certainly equivalent 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.079
 because we have people with a gb 9 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.209
 they reach almost 16 thousand points 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:57.630
 but let's go now to what I think it is 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:01.709
 the most significant test of the lot that 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:04.099
 the speed test net this test because 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.450
 significant because it really succeeds 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:09.690
 check which ones the subsystem has 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.629
 terminal radio how 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:16.140
 first of all because here where I'm in the area 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:19.410
 covered by h3g antennas with 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:23.040
 speed of 42 megabits according to why 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.680
 calimera itself and has a speed 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.780
 theoretical maximum of 21 megabits in 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.430
 download 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.500
 then why are we going to use like 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.269
 you can see from the settings a 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.209
 server to perform the test 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.889
 enjoy right inside the h3g network 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.470
 therefore we should eliminate in theory 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:42.930
 all the spurious ones in 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.400
 this text obviously then speed 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.290
 that the skill at the terminal will depend 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.819
 also surely from the say 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.069
 network occupation 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:55.410
 when and trafficking 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:58.680
 better network at the time we do the 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.989
 test we are going to announce that we see 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.260
 so everything is tested 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:08.270
 ping at 74 milliseconds then speed 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:13.080
 in down you see has reached 13 May 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:17.250
 and the speed in the app more or less around 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:23.010
 at 2 and 7 you can do it again 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:27.990
 the test pushes like 74 the speed in 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:33.330
 down around 12 in 7 and the app you see 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:35.940
 exceeds 3 with 313 we do the last 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.690
 once the test ping is always one of the 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:44.300
 70 milliseconds the speed in from one 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:48.419
 13 and the next one in the new app 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:50.760
 a little more than 3 megabits 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.530
 let's say some excellent presses of the best 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.290
 results for this terminal but if 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.360
 see the various tests carried out in the course 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:00.080
 of the various days 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:05.040
 see that the terminal has reached 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:07.460
 precisely today the maximum peak with 13.01 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:11.370
 megabits regarding the app instead 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:14.520
 even managed to touch 3.65 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:17.010
 megabit in really opens up a great one 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:20.400
 result for this terminal that yes 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:24.110
 confirms once again the current 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.669
 top of the range for android 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.500
 I thank you for doing me I hope 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:33.169
 to have bored you as usual a 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.169
 hello from your tecnost hello
