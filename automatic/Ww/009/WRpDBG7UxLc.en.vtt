replayability<00:05:23.870> does<00:05:24.199> this<00:05:24.380> bring<00:05:24.650> to<00:05:25.310> the

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
replayability does this bring to the

replayability does this bring to the
base<00:05:25.610> game<00:05:25.639> really<00:05:26.180> well<00:05:29.320> it<00:05:30.320> puts<00:05:30.590> in<00:05:30.800> a<00:05:31.039> load

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:31.759 
base game really well it puts in a load

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:35.379 
base game really well it puts in a load
more<00:05:31.970> cards<00:05:32.389> so<00:05:32.720> those<00:05:32.960> those<00:05:34.210> cards<00:05:35.210> are<00:05:35.300> you

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
more cards so those those cards are you

drawing<00:05:35.599> randomly<00:05:36.729> is<00:05:37.729> that<00:05:38.210> that's<00:05:38.479> how<00:05:38.720> it

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
drawing randomly is that that's how it

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.409 
drawing randomly is that that's how it
extends<00:05:40.340> the<00:05:40.490> replayability<00:05:40.820> there's

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
extends the replayability there's

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:44.350 
extends the replayability there's
there's<00:05:41.659> more<00:05:41.960> cards<00:05:42.470> to<00:05:42.680> come<00:05:43.310> out<00:05:43.460> randomly

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
there's more cards to come out randomly

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:50.499 
there's more cards to come out randomly
into<00:05:44.979> space<00:05:48.520> so<00:05:49.520> yes<00:05:49.789> it<00:05:49.940> increased<00:05:50.300> through

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:50.509 
into space so yes it increased through

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:54.760 
into space so yes it increased through
play<00:05:50.690> with<00:05:50.870> you<00:05:50.990> but<00:05:51.370> it<00:05:52.370> mostly<00:05:53.060> does<00:05:53.330> that<00:05:53.770> by

play with you but it mostly does that by

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.839 
play with you but it mostly does that by
