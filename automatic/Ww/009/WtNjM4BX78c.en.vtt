00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
and in this series we're going to be

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.230 
and in this series we're going to be
looking<00:00:04.620> at<00:00:04.920> creating<00:00:05.160> a<00:00:05.580> responsive<00:00:06.210> site

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
looking at creating a responsive site

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.660 
looking at creating a responsive site
using<00:00:06.810> this<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:07.200> bootstrap<00:00:07.799> CSS<00:00:07.980> framework

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
using this the bootstrap CSS framework

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.879 
using this the bootstrap CSS framework
now<00:00:09.540> what<00:00:09.719> this<00:00:09.840> framework<00:00:10.050> allows<00:00:10.440> us<00:00:10.620> to<00:00:10.740> do

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
now what this framework allows us to do

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.180 
now what this framework allows us to do
is<00:00:11.190> create<00:00:11.550> responsive<00:00:12.269> web<00:00:12.960> pages<00:00:13.200> that<00:00:13.980> will

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
is create responsive web pages that will

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.670 
is create responsive web pages that will
kind<00:00:14.429> of<00:00:14.690> expand<00:00:15.690> as<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.289> screen<00:00:16.470> resolution

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
kind of expand as the screen resolution

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.400 
kind of expand as the screen resolution
changes<00:00:17.150> so<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.180> don't<00:00:18.359> meet<00:00:18.449> any<00:00:18.750> example<00:00:19.170> of

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
changes so I don't meet any example of

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.609 
changes so I don't meet any example of
the<00:00:19.500> bootstrap<00:00:19.770> so<00:00:20.869> so<00:00:21.869> if<00:00:22.080> we<00:00:22.199> look<00:00:22.350> at<00:00:22.470> it

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
the bootstrap so so if we look at it

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.509 
the bootstrap so so if we look at it
standard<00:00:23.180> 1920<00:00:24.180> by<00:00:24.359> 1080<00:00:24.779> resolution<00:00:25.519> it

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
standard 1920 by 1080 resolution it

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.220 
standard 1920 by 1080 resolution it
looks<00:00:26.789> really<00:00:27.119> nice<00:00:27.269> everything's<00:00:27.990> fitting

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
looks really nice everything's fitting

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.240 
looks really nice everything's fitting
properly<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:29.359> nothing<00:00:30.359> kind<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.689> seems<00:00:30.929> like

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
properly and nothing kind of seems like

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.160 
properly and nothing kind of seems like
really<00:00:32.250> small<00:00:32.669> down<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.090> middle<00:00:33.210> if<00:00:33.989> that

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
really small down the middle if that

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.150 
really small down the middle if that
makes<00:00:34.350> sense

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
makes sense

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.790 
makes sense
and<00:00:35.610> if<00:00:35.730> we<00:00:35.850> drag<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.180> in<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:37.200> see<00:00:37.440> it's<00:00:37.590> sort

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
and if we drag it in you see it's sort

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.069 
and if we drag it in you see it's sort
of<00:00:37.860> resizes<00:00:38.579> itself<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:39.570> there<00:00:39.840> you've<00:00:39.930> got<00:00:39.960> a

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
of resizes itself so there you've got a

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.600 
of resizes itself so there you've got a
portrait<00:00:40.710> tablet<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.309> then<00:00:41.430> you've<00:00:41.520> got

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
portrait tablet and then you've got

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.619 
portrait tablet and then you've got
mobile<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.440> the<00:00:43.440> navigation<00:00:44.149> all<00:00:45.149> sort<00:00:45.510> of

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
mobile and the navigation all sort of

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.729 
mobile and the navigation all sort of
adjusts<00:00:46.440> itself<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:47.010> fit<00:00:47.670> properly<00:00:48.680> on<00:00:49.680> a

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
adjusts itself to fit properly on a

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.850 
adjusts itself to fit properly on a
phone<00:00:50.300> so<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.750> how<00:00:51.930> powerful<00:00:52.260> bootstrap

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
phone so this is how powerful bootstrap

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.700 
phone so this is how powerful bootstrap
is<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.719> we<00:00:54.719> will<00:00:54.930> barely<00:00:55.110> have<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.410> do<00:00:55.500> any

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:12.419 
bottom now if we brought this out here

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:17.330

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
we can resize this and it's still

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.680 
we can resize this and it's still
fitting<00:03:17.760> properly<00:03:17.940> you<00:03:18.209> see<00:03:18.389> we<00:03:18.479> get<00:03:18.569> this

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
fitting properly you see we get this

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.680 
fitting properly you see we get this
button<00:03:18.989> here<00:03:19.109> now<00:03:19.489> and<00:03:20.489> that<00:03:20.819> drops<00:03:21.269> down<00:03:21.359> like

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
button here now and that drops down like

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.960 
button here now and that drops down like
that<00:03:22.220> so<00:03:23.220> everything's<00:03:23.519> fitting<00:03:23.669> properly

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
that so everything's fitting properly

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.689 
that so everything's fitting properly
there<00:03:24.799> and<00:03:25.799> you<00:03:25.949> can<00:03:26.069> see<00:03:26.190> when<00:03:26.310> we<00:03:26.340> get<00:03:26.489> even

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:26.699 
there and you can see when we get even

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:30.259 
there and you can see when we get even
smaller<00:03:26.819> our<00:03:27.680> content<00:03:28.680> views<00:03:28.979> are<00:03:29.190> going<00:03:30.060> her

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
smaller our content views are going her

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.050 
smaller our content views are going her
vertical<00:03:31.109> instead<00:03:31.440> of<00:03:31.530> horizontal<00:03:31.849> so<00:03:32.849> is

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
vertical instead of horizontal so is

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.759 
vertical instead of horizontal so is
restructuring<00:03:33.599> everything<00:03:34.199> to<00:03:34.379> fit<00:03:34.590> properly

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
restructuring everything to fit properly

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.460 
restructuring everything to fit properly

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
and obviously we can keep going as small

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.520 
and obviously we can keep going as small
