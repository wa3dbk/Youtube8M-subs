is working um it looks really powdery
which<00:03:37.870> I<00:03:38.310> guess<00:03:39.310> is<00:03:39.340> the<00:03:39.520> point<00:03:40.920> but<00:03:41.920> I<00:03:41.980> did<00:03:42.310> put

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
which I guess is the point but I did put

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.280 
which I guess is the point but I did put
the<00:03:42.610> stain<00:03:43.030> matte<00:03:43.210> powder<00:03:43.390> over<00:03:43.810> top<00:03:43.990> of<00:03:44.020> it

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
the stain matte powder over top of it

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.810 
the stain matte powder over top of it
which<00:03:44.500> I<00:03:44.620> don't<00:03:44.680> think<00:03:44.860> that<00:03:45.070> you<00:03:45.250> need<00:03:45.520> to<00:03:45.670> do

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
which I don't think that you need to do

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.570 
which I don't think that you need to do
unless<00:03:46.090> you<00:03:46.270> have<00:03:46.450> really<00:03:46.480> oily<00:03:47.020> skin<00:03:47.530> I<00:03:47.740> don't

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
unless you have really oily skin I don't

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.430 
unless you have really oily skin I don't
have<00:03:48.790> really<00:03:49.060> oily<00:03:49.240> skin<00:03:49.750> I<00:03:49.959> guess<00:03:50.140> I'm<00:03:50.320> just

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
have really oily skin I guess I'm just

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.110 
have really oily skin I guess I'm just

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
so used to putting powder over top of

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.920 
so used to putting powder over top of
liquid<00:03:52.630> foundation<00:03:53.170> that<00:03:53.920> I<00:03:54.810> didn't<00:03:55.810> think

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
liquid foundation that I didn't think

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.510 
liquid foundation that I didn't think
about<00:03:56.140> the<00:03:56.350> fact<00:03:56.500> that<00:03:56.680> I<00:03:56.800> probably<00:03:57.100> didn't

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
about the fact that I probably didn't

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.710 
about the fact that I probably didn't
need<00:03:57.610> it<00:03:57.760> so<00:03:58.570> I<00:03:59.430> I<00:04:00.430> definitely<00:04:01.180> think<00:04:01.600> that

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
need it so I I definitely think that

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.030 
need it so I I definitely think that

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.970 
broken out so yeah I mean I'm happy with
this<00:04:15.520> when<00:04:15.760> it<00:04:15.910> went<00:04:16.090> on<00:04:16.329> um<00:04:16.840> it<00:04:17.530> didn't<00:04:17.890> look

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
this when it went on um it didn't look

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.830 
this when it went on um it didn't look
like<00:04:18.040> it<00:04:18.190> was<00:04:18.370> going<00:04:18.549> to<00:04:18.640> cover<00:04:18.880> my<00:04:19.150> pores<00:04:19.480> at

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
like it was going to cover my pores at

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.610 
like it was going to cover my pores at
all<00:04:20.079> um<00:04:20.440> as<00:04:21.250> I<00:04:22.090> was<00:04:22.240> rubbing<00:04:22.510> it<00:04:22.810> in<00:04:22.960> though<00:04:23.230> um

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
all um as I was rubbing it in though um

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.460 
all um as I was rubbing it in though um
it<00:04:24.280> was<00:04:24.520> like<00:04:24.700> they<00:04:25.000> were<00:04:25.330> standing<00:04:25.990> out<00:04:26.140> even

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
it was like they were standing out even

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.700 
it was like they were standing out even
more<00:04:26.500> than<00:04:26.830> they<00:04:27.010> do<00:04:27.070> without<00:04:27.610> makeup<00:04:28.710> but

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
more than they do without makeup but

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.950 
more than they do without makeup but
after<00:04:30.190> it<00:04:31.090> I<00:04:31.479> guess<00:04:31.780> mattified<00:04:32.620> I<00:04:33.840> mean<00:04:34.840> they

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
after it I guess mattified I mean they

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.630 
after it I guess mattified I mean they
kind<00:04:35.229> of<00:04:35.350> went<00:04:35.500> invisible<00:04:35.680> there's<00:04:36.370> still<00:04:36.610> a

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
kind of went invisible there's still a

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.140 
kind of went invisible there's still a
little<00:04:36.940> bit<00:04:37.090> noticeable<00:04:38.880> but<00:04:40.140> compared<00:04:41.140> to

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
little bit noticeable but compared to

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.030 
little bit noticeable but compared to
any<00:04:43.150> other<00:04:43.360> foundation<00:04:44.140> I<00:04:44.410> think<00:04:44.680> that<00:04:44.800> I<00:04:44.830> used

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
any other foundation I think that I used

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.610 
any other foundation I think that I used
to<00:04:45.250> put<00:04:45.520> together<00:04:45.729> work<00:04:46.720> really<00:04:46.990> well<00:04:47.140> for

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
to put together work really well for

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.950 
to put together work really well for
covering<00:04:48.220> pores<00:04:49.229> for<00:04:50.850> covering<00:04:51.850> any<00:04:52.300> kind<00:04:52.870> of

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
covering pores for covering any kind of

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.850 
covering pores for covering any kind of
acne<00:04:53.440> I<00:04:54.400> had<00:04:54.880> a<00:04:54.910> couple<00:04:55.270> places<00:04:55.690> under<00:04:56.380> my<00:04:56.560> chin
