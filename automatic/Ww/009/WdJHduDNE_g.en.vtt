up<00:03:26.740> raised<00:03:27.490> fist<00:03:27.940> so<00:03:28.360> you<00:03:28.630> know<00:03:28.720> obviously

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
up raised fist so you know obviously

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.470 
up raised fist so you know obviously
stability<00:03:30.010> still<00:03:30.250> provides<00:03:30.580> the<00:03:30.820> immunity<00:03:31.270> to

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
stability still provides the immunity to

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
most of the CC control related effects

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.300 
most of the CC control related effects
but<00:03:34.930> because<00:03:35.140> it<00:03:35.260> is<00:03:35.290> a<00:03:35.410> boon<00:03:35.620> it<00:03:35.740> is<00:03:35.860> triple

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
but because it is a boon it is triple

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.340 
but because it is a boon it is triple
and<00:03:37.030> you<00:03:37.180> know<00:03:37.300> I<00:03:37.330> started<00:03:37.690> playing<00:03:37.990> this<00:03:38.170> you

by the school of like five hundred to
four<00:04:55.419> hundred<00:04:55.479> so<00:04:55.780> it<00:04:56.020> wasn't<00:04:56.319> oh<00:04:56.500> right<00:04:56.889> here

00:04:57.059 --> 00:04:57.069 
four hundred so it wasn't oh right here

00:04:57.069 --> 00:04:58.320 
four hundred so it wasn't oh right here
by<00:04:57.160> the<00:04:57.220> way<00:04:57.310> so<00:04:57.520> this<00:04:57.669> is<00:04:57.789> something<00:04:57.910> cool

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
by the way so this is something cool

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.600 
by the way so this is something cool
like<00:04:58.360> i<00:04:58.569> fear<00:04:58.900> the<00:04:59.169> necra<00:05:00.069> they<00:05:00.190> are<00:05:00.280> when<00:05:00.520> the

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
like i fear the necra they are when the

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.640 
like i fear the necra they are when the
necro<00:05:00.820> gets<00:05:00.970> low<00:05:01.419> health<00:05:01.690> so<00:05:01.990> that<00:05:02.020> while<00:05:02.410> the

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
necro gets low health so that while the

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.110 
necro gets low health so that while the
necros<00:05:02.979> feared<00:05:03.430> we<00:05:03.550> can<00:05:03.669> finish<00:05:03.880> off<00:05:04.090> that

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
necros feared we can finish off that

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.600 
necros feared we can finish off that
player<00:05:04.509> before<00:05:05.009> they<00:05:06.009> can<00:05:06.190> counter<00:05:06.580> with

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
player before they can counter with

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.950 
player before they can counter with
their<00:05:06.880> deaths<00:05:07.060> routes<00:05:07.330> so<00:05:07.509> sometimes<00:05:07.810> it's

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
their deaths routes so sometimes it's

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.210 
their deaths routes so sometimes it's
really<00:05:08.110> important<00:05:08.470> to<00:05:08.500> anticipate<00:05:09.009> you<00:05:09.130> know

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220

gut<00:05:37.599> isn't<00:05:37.870> a<00:05:37.930> good<00:05:38.020> spec<00:05:38.289> it's<00:05:38.500> just<00:05:38.680> that<00:05:38.800> you

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:39.009 
gut isn't a good spec it's just that you

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:40.350 
gut isn't a good spec it's just that you
know<00:05:39.099> you<00:05:39.159> need<00:05:39.340> to<00:05:39.430> look<00:05:39.550> at<00:05:39.699> your<00:05:39.849> comp<00:05:40.150> and

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
know you need to look at your comp and

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.270 
know you need to look at your comp and
figure<00:05:40.570> out<00:05:40.630> what<00:05:41.020> makes<00:05:41.199> sense<00:05:41.349> so<00:05:41.770> you<00:05:42.190> know
