00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 already about a year ago we have 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.350
 the first time in detail about that 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.599
 ambitious project end ral reports 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.219
 who can not remember about addiction 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.830
 no idea what it is 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.260
 acts behind others hides 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.080
 a gigantic death conversion too 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.689
 Write or more precisely a new game 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.970
 that of course in many places and in 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.609
 many mechanics remind of skyrim 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.590
 but independent enough is around 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.470
 not just a blatant 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.600
 on the contrary, the only change behind it 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.329
 for example, want a big one 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.910
 weakness of ska ironing namely the 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.860
 relevance poor narration of the original 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.290
 exchange for a captivating one 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.079
 with a clever beginning and a 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.590
 clever end in between then quite 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.059
 many very familiar conversations at 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.430
 right away what is with you then 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.230
 He happens to look like he did 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.710
 the black watcher most personally 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.320
 seen 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.690
 ok, at least that's what we do 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.309
 Others have been allowed to hear 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.159
 not only the mother herself but also 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.020
 so many talents become involved 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.260
 for example, important figures like 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.729
 jesper lives breathed 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.590
 By the way, do not worry now 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.280
 a clever hairstyle vince that martin 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.970
 Shui has promised a dream in that 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.880
 her burned louder 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:27.640
 and see a bright light as change 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.340
 Now we could start exactly 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.380
 but do not want to show it in the 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.830
 Opening sequence is already the 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.870
 first big oha moment as change ends 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.670
 We simply do not know until then 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.230
 conversion is totally ready should 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.920
 a few more months into the country 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.990
 pull 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.050
 how in between we play 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.030
 but already tried after the 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.530
 pregnant with meaning 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.540
 first into the character 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.270
 Generating then under mysterious 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.990
 circumstances on the island change as to 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.690
 be stranded 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.790
 our hero hopes for others 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.740
 peace and maybe even one 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.869
 bit prosperous but his 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.119
 past his present and already 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.399
 His future does not want him in 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.920
 he has a strange vision 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.690
 suddenly realizes that he is magically gifted 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.880
 The country suffers from one 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.130
 mysterious epidemic the humans 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.740
 by turning and committing brutal murders 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.190
 leaves and somehow he's in all the 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.680
 in it 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.870
 to the mystery of such on the 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.519
 to come and think about it 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.200
 worst to prevent 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:31.330
 Let's get away from it 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.580
 beautiful and varied 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.040
 landscapes to survive adventure 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.480
 as it is lovely market that is happy 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.820
 over the golden forest of 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.610
 autumnal red in the sunlight shines 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.820
 The Caribbean flair addiction looks forward to 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.050
 a detour to the island of chor 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.519
 In contrast, there is plenty of slanting in the 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:53.080
 area of crystalline 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.360
 landscape certainly offers change 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.000
 All significantly more variety than it 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.769
 liked to do and we in the splendid 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.360
 Do not just look up in the air 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.370
 but also look at the ground 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.930
 he may take one now and then 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.510
 dig up little treasure 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.100
 oh well do not worry that skyrim standard 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.260
 outfit of our heroine here too 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.450
 exchanged for something new 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.400
 the basic mechanics of the two 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.680
 But first of all, the game remains 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.629
 same we level our character 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.010
 high by fulfilling quests or 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:23.010
 thwart villains 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.150
 From level up we can do our basic values 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.560
 improve and on top of that with so-called 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.530
 memorable points 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.430
 our magic rascals or fighting games 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.920
 breed high 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.390
 that works in the current us 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.480
 present version something else 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:56.300
 awkward in this mini parallel world 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.340
 at three large stone structures in the 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.650
 manufacture old should that be easy 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.690
 go through a menu that looks like 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.690
 then not spared so chic 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.940
 but we have two loading screens and the 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.440
 confusion of stones one 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.290
 pretty much a small one 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.390
 improvement over skyrim tinkering 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.500
 Here we are at the handicraft 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.870
 station together 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.970
 our first and still quite small 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.980
 backpack later in the game with the 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.020
 We are allowed to plan accordingly 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.710
 also make a larger copy 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.540
 this significantly increases our load capacity 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.460
 Another detail improvement is 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.220
 about the much clearer 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.230
 fast access menu in which we use ours 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.870
 skills and weapons comfortable the 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:41.510
 You can also assign number keys 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.970
 pretty well the camps we managed 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.710
 can build old fireplaces here 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.140
 that's wonderful 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.570
 inventory clear out and shows that we 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.970
 Need acute light in a big chest 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.620
 then we will find this chest 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.690
 in the settlements to the craft 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.470
 stations again and can and start 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.260
 serve 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.480
 But such comfort functions are only 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.520
 the icing on the cake is a lot 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.530
 it will be more decisive if we end up 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.580
 with his narration permanently in the 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.440
 ban can beat 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.200
 In this regard, we are good things 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:15.740
 because that the mod team can tell has 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:18.440
 it already proved with kidneys closer 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.960
 that's the total conversion that's 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.390
 team already made to oblivion like 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.880
 Do not play necessarily yet 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:29.560
 a nice way to see the time 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.560
 others appear to be bridging
