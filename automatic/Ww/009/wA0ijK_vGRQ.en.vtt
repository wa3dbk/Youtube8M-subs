metal<00:00:19.500> rods<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.949> game<00:00:20.070> obviously<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.699> a

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
metal rods to the game obviously and a

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.980 
metal rods to the game obviously and a
metal<00:00:20.939> trapdoor<00:00:21.680> so<00:00:22.820> to<00:00:23.820> make<00:00:23.939> iron<00:00:24.240> rods<00:00:24.689> you

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
metal trapdoor so to make iron rods you

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.710 
metal trapdoor so to make iron rods you
need<00:00:25.140> an<00:00:25.260> iron<00:00:25.410> anger<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.300> then<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.420> can<00:00:27.570> just

need an iron anger and then you can just

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.500 
need an iron anger and then you can just
place<00:00:27.930> them<00:00:28.140> like<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.279> you'll<00:00:30.119> get<00:00:30.210> four

not sure how much and durability adds
I'll<00:00:42.120> advent<00:00:42.450> an<00:00:42.600> annotation<00:00:43.020> as<00:00:43.290> soon<00:00:43.320> as<00:00:43.530> I

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
I'll advent an annotation as soon as I

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.220 
I'll advent an annotation as soon as I
find<00:00:43.770> out<00:00:44.000> but<00:00:45.000> anyway<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.629> adds<00:00:45.899> same

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
find out but anyway it adds same

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.889 
find out but anyway it adds same
durability<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.610> everything<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.180> don't<00:00:48.690> see

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
durability to everything I don't see

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.660 
durability to everything I don't see
anyone<00:00:49.110> bothering<00:00:49.500> with<00:00:49.649> these<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:50.070> think<00:00:50.100> that

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
anyone bothering with these I think that

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.310 
anyone bothering with these I think that
you'll<00:00:50.820> only<00:00:51.059> really<00:00:51.390> start<00:00:51.629> using<00:00:51.780> iron<00:00:52.050> as

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
you'll only really start using iron as

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.900 
you'll only really start using iron as
soon<00:00:52.440> as<00:00:52.559> you've<00:00:52.649> got<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.949> iron<00:00:53.129> pickaxe

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
soon as you've got the iron pickaxe

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.400 
soon as you've got the iron pickaxe
anyway<00:00:54.360> just<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.930> improve<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:57.350> I'll<00:00:58.350> just

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
anyway just to improve it so I'll just

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.020 
anyway just to improve it so I'll just
pick<00:00:58.710> up<00:00:58.829> these<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.219> show<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.399> what<00:00:59.760> else<00:00:59.910> they

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
pick up these to show you what else they

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.049 
pick up these to show you what else they
can<00:01:00.120> be<00:01:00.270> used<00:01:00.390> for<00:01:00.449> later<00:01:01.309> and<00:01:02.309> then<00:01:02.579> here<00:01:02.910> we

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
can be used for later and then here we

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.850 
can be used for later and then here we
have<00:01:03.210> gold<00:01:03.600> which<00:01:03.960> does<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.290> same<00:01:04.320> thing<00:01:04.680> only

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
have gold which does the same thing only

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.649 
have gold which does the same thing only
improves<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.549> enchant<00:01:05.909> ability<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.420> an<00:01:06.510> item

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
improves the enchant ability of an item

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.910 
improves the enchant ability of an item
making<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.500> more<00:01:07.650> likely<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.250> get<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:09.920> get

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
making you more likely to get a get

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.480 
making you more likely to get a get
different<00:01:11.130> items<00:01:11.580> again<00:01:12.020> you<00:01:13.020> can<00:01:13.140> just<00:01:13.490> do

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
different items again you can just do

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.200 
different items again you can just do
that<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.700> get<00:01:14.970> your<00:01:15.119> four<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:16.970> I'll<00:01:17.970> just

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
that to get your four and I'll just

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.270 
that to get your four and I'll just
prove<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.869> they<00:01:19.020> do<00:01:19.140> actually<00:01:19.290> work<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:20.130> make

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
prove that they do actually work to make

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.320 
prove that they do actually work to make
something<00:01:20.520> we<00:01:20.820> will<00:01:20.939> make<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.560> pickaxe<00:01:23.240> so<00:01:24.240> it's

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
something we will make a pickaxe so it's

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.850 
something we will make a pickaxe so it's
golden<00:01:24.689> pickaxe<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:28.520> there's<00:01:29.520> an<00:01:29.790> iron<00:01:30.150> a

golden pickaxe and there's an iron a
pickaxe<00:01:31.860> as<00:01:32.009> well<00:01:32.869> so<00:01:33.869> that's<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.710> part<00:01:35.070> they

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
pickaxe as well so that's that part they

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.999 
pickaxe as well so that's that part they
can<00:01:35.909> also<00:01:36.119> be<00:01:36.329> used<00:01:36.420> however<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:37.710> make<00:01:37.829> iron

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
can also be used however to make iron

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.539 
can also be used however to make iron
railings<00:01:38.600> you<00:01:39.600> need<00:01:39.750> 64<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:41.159> make<00:01:41.280> six

and<00:03:45.459> we<00:03:46.459> will<00:03:46.640> place<00:03:46.970> it<00:03:47.150> just<00:03:47.780> like<00:03:47.900> a<00:03:47.930> normal

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:48.109 
and we will place it just like a normal

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:52.180 
and we will place it just like a normal
trapdoor<00:03:48.650> and<00:03:49.390> we<00:03:50.390> cannot<00:03:50.660> say<00:03:51.190> cannot

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
trapdoor and we cannot say cannot

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.610 
trapdoor and we cannot say cannot
activate<00:03:52.790> it<00:03:52.959> now<00:03:53.959> if<00:03:54.019> we<00:03:54.109> take<00:03:54.260> some<00:03:54.410> redstone

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
activate it now if we take some redstone

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:01.120 
activate it now if we take some redstone
and<00:03:56.410> just<00:03:57.410> run<00:03:58.100> over<00:03:58.130> to<00:03:58.519> hearsay<00:03:59.380> then<00:04:00.380> take<00:04:00.799> a

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
and just run over to hearsay then take a

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.830 
and just run over to hearsay then take a
redstone<00:04:01.910> torch<00:04:03.250> whoops<00:04:04.450> take<00:04:05.450> your<00:04:05.540> redstone

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
redstone torch whoops take your redstone

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.410 
redstone torch whoops take your redstone
torch<00:04:06.170> and<00:04:06.380> activates<00:04:06.980> I<00:04:07.250> with<00:04:07.940> an<00:04:08.060> off<00:04:08.150> pulse

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
torch and activates I with an off pulse

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.330 
torch and activates I with an off pulse
it<00:04:08.630> will<00:04:08.780> turn<00:04:08.900> off<00:04:09.140> this<00:04:09.769> can<00:04:10.010> be<00:04:10.070> done<00:04:10.190> from

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
it will turn off this can be done from

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.190 
it will turn off this can be done from
any<00:04:10.609> sides<00:04:11.000> and<00:04:11.299> i<00:04:11.959> think<00:04:12.350> i<00:04:13.269> think<00:04:14.269> if<00:04:14.840> we<00:04:14.900> grab

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
any sides and i think i think if we grab

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.599 
any sides and i think i think if we grab
a<00:04:15.230> repeater<00:04:15.650> a<00:04:17.769> hit<00:04:18.769> actually<00:04:18.859> power<00:04:19.250> it<00:04:19.400> from

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
a repeater a hit actually power it from

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.820 
a repeater a hit actually power it from
the<00:04:19.729> other<00:04:19.850> side<00:04:20.289> because<00:04:21.289> what<00:04:21.470> repeaters

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:21.830 
the other side because what repeaters

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.409 
the other side because what repeaters
can<00:04:21.979> do<00:04:22.070> is<00:04:22.159> they<00:04:22.280> can<00:04:22.400> push<00:04:22.610> and<00:04:22.849> pull<00:04:23.060> current
