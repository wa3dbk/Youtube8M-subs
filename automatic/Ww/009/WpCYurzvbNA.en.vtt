00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.189
 My business deals with the topic 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.139
 high beds and the raised beds are 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.589
 first came from the hills offer 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.519
 and sooner from the compost heap 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:16.619
 if you remember that 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.169
 There used to be gourds in the past 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.149
 planted on the compost heap and the 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:22.619
 have grown great and told me 

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:24.050
 human reminds that just has to 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.759
 others will go as well then one has 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.820
 the hill chain inlaid 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:31.140
 you also tried right there 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.780
 materials that occur in the garden like 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.440
 roads or other things, etc 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.370
 to work in and there was the heat 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.970
 exploited 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.430
 then the turnover was realized 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.180
 practically the plant is better 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.730
 have grown 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.040
 today we deal with 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.110
 high beds can also see here 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:56.190
 and they have a better one 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.380
 exploiting the heat 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.320
 because the sun is on the 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:04.649
 side windows can and it brings 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.820
 really very early vegetables and what you get 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:08.909
 I'll do that too if you can 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.710
 that also with flower vision and but 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.240
 as I said the vegetables can be several times 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.280
 harvest in the year we have here now 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.649
 just salad harvested and are now 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.649
 doing so again replanted 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:18.649
 replanted 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.770
 raised beds not only have to be square and 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:30.659
 look boxy but for small 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:33.640
 Occasions such as balcony small corners 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.560
 or where not much can grow 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.520
 you just put the whole thing in 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:42.219
 sacks in the bucket in buckets or withdraws 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.479
 Of course it is important to plant 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:47.770
 every tube and holes has to the water 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.729
 You can cool it off with normal 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:55.780
 soil and plant several times in 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:02:00.310
 year and has a rich harvest 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:05.489
 for example, one of the smallest spaces 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:09.840
 deciduous bag diameter about 50 centimeters 

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:15.840
 and he we have a borre good herb 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:19.930
 twice salad and a good plant 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:23.319
 a lemon cucumber the over and over 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.150
 full of fruits and that depends on 40 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.410
 Centimeters and the salad you can 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.410
 plant several times
