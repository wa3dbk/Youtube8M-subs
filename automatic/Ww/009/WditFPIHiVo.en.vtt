more<00:01:47.369> than<00:01:47.490> capable<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.970> building<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.840> but<00:01:49.110> I

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
more than capable of building it but I

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.160 
more than capable of building it but I
don't<00:01:50.610> know<00:01:50.790> I'm<00:01:51.210> pretty<00:01:51.420> pumped<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.899> was<00:01:51.990> kind

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
don't know I'm pretty pumped it was kind

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.710 
don't know I'm pretty pumped it was kind
of<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.640> impulse<00:01:53.640> like<00:01:53.939> screw<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.329> this<00:01:54.540> is<00:01:54.600> going

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
of a impulse like screw it this is going

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.359

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
obviously it's always a little bit of an

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.120 
obviously it's always a little bit of an
expense<00:02:54.850> doing<00:02:55.150> something<00:02:55.450> like<00:02:55.540> that<00:02:55.750> but

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
expense doing something like that but

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
I'm pumped for it it's really going to

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.210 
I'm pumped for it it's really going to
just<00:02:58.600> expand<00:02:58.990> that<00:02:59.170> I've<00:02:59.470> got<00:02:59.620> a<00:02:59.650> lot<00:02:59.830> of<00:02:59.860> for

so that's what I'm excited about and I

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.970 
so that's what I'm excited about and I
figured<00:04:35.750> I<00:04:36.140> wasn't<00:04:36.410> going<00:04:36.560> to<00:04:36.620> make<00:04:36.740> a<00:04:36.770> video

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
figured I wasn't going to make a video

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.140
