iodine<00:00:03.940> will<00:00:04.510> kill<00:00:04.870> a<00:00:05.110> hundred<00:00:05.410> percent<00:00:05.710> of

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:06.130 
iodine will kill a hundred percent of

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.640 
iodine will kill a hundred percent of
the<00:00:06.640> bacterias<00:00:07.359> and<00:00:07.390> viruses<00:00:07.600> in<00:00:08.320> the<00:00:08.350> water

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:08.650 
the bacterias and viruses in the water

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.770 
the bacterias and viruses in the water
and<00:00:08.920> is<00:00:09.309> a<00:00:09.340> very<00:00:09.670> effective<00:00:10.000> way<00:00:10.360> to<00:00:10.420> clean

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:10.780 
and is a very effective way to clean

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:11.520 
and is a very effective way to clean
your<00:00:10.809> water

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:11.530 
your water

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.579 
your water
now<00:00:12.460> the<00:00:12.879> bacterias<00:00:13.480> and<00:00:13.509> viruses<00:00:13.690> like<00:00:14.169> to

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:14.589 
now the bacterias and viruses like to

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:17.370 
now the bacterias and viruses like to
hide<00:00:14.860> on<00:00:15.129> the<00:00:15.730> particles<00:00:16.299> and<00:00:16.570> if<00:00:17.230> they're

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:17.380 
hide on the particles and if they're

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.109 
hide on the particles and if they're
hiding<00:00:17.590> the<00:00:18.070> iodine<00:00:18.430> won't<00:00:18.609> be<00:00:18.730> able<00:00:18.820> to<00:00:18.970> get

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.119 
hiding the iodine won't be able to get

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:19.529 
hiding the iodine won't be able to get
to<00:00:19.300> them

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:19.539 
to them

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:22.830 
to them
so<00:00:19.900> I<00:00:19.930> like<00:00:20.260> to<00:00:20.289> use<00:00:20.710> the<00:00:21.189> giant<00:00:21.580> water<00:00:21.820> sock<00:00:22.210> to

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:22.840 
so I like to use the giant water sock to

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.169 
so I like to use the giant water sock to
pre-filter<00:00:23.470> my<00:00:23.619> water<00:00:23.859> because<00:00:24.730> this<00:00:24.910> sock

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:25.179 
pre-filter my water because this sock

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:27.950 
pre-filter my water because this sock
will<00:00:25.449> filter<00:00:25.689> water<00:00:26.050> down<00:00:26.410> to<00:00:27.160> one<00:00:27.369> micron

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
will filter water down to one micron

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.380 
will filter water down to one micron
this<00:00:28.960> is<00:00:29.259> not<00:00:29.439> a<00:00:29.470> standalone<00:00:29.980> filter<00:00:30.519> but<00:00:31.240> it's

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
this is not a standalone filter but it's

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.300 
this is not a standalone filter but it's
great<00:00:31.750> to<00:00:32.140> use<00:00:32.290> in<00:00:32.439> conjunction<00:00:32.830> with<00:00:33.070> either

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:33.310 
great to use in conjunction with either

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.850 
great to use in conjunction with either
your<00:00:33.550> gravity<00:00:34.060> water<00:00:34.270> filter<00:00:34.840> for<00:00:35.440> your<00:00:35.590> polar

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
your gravity water filter for your polar

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.369 
your gravity water filter for your polar
pure<00:00:36.160> iodine<00:00:36.579> crystals<00:00:36.730> or<00:00:37.239> with<00:00:37.840> chlorine

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:38.379 
pure iodine crystals or with chlorine

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:41.069 
pure iodine crystals or with chlorine
this<00:00:39.280> would<00:00:39.489> also<00:00:39.700> be<00:00:39.910> a<00:00:40.239> great<00:00:40.600> combination

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
this would also be a great combination

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:44.760 
this would also be a great combination
to<00:00:41.530> put<00:00:41.739> in<00:00:41.950> a<00:00:42.129> backpack<00:00:42.430> a<00:00:43.170> 72-hour<00:00:44.170> kit<00:00:44.500> or<00:00:44.710> a

to put in a backpack a 72-hour kit or a
camping<00:00:45.640> kit<00:00:45.879> now<00:00:46.750> let<00:00:46.930> me<00:00:47.050> show<00:00:47.230> you<00:00:47.289> how<00:00:47.500> to

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
camping kit now let me show you how to

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.220 
camping kit now let me show you how to
use<00:00:47.890> the<00:00:48.070> polar<00:00:48.280> pure<00:00:48.579> iodine<00:00:49.090> the<00:00:49.809> reason<00:00:50.140> I

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
use the polar pure iodine the reason I

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.139 
use the polar pure iodine the reason I
chose<00:00:50.469> polar<00:00:50.829> pure<00:00:51.160> is<00:00:51.309> because<00:00:51.640> this<00:00:51.879> one

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
chose polar pure is because this one

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.260 
chose polar pure is because this one

then let it sit for one hour while that

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.010 
then let it sit for one hour while that
solution<00:01:16.270> saturates

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
solution saturates

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.470 
solution saturates
each<00:01:17.560> time<00:01:17.980> you<00:01:18.130> use<00:01:18.310> your<00:01:18.340> polar<00:01:18.760> pure<00:01:19.090> you

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:19.480 
each time you use your polar pure you

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.020 
each time you use your polar pure you
can<00:01:19.660> fill<00:01:19.930> it<00:01:20.050> up<00:01:20.170> so<00:01:20.770> that<00:01:20.920> next<00:01:21.190> time<00:01:21.370> it's

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
can fill it up so that next time it's

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.460 
can fill it up so that next time it's
ready<00:01:22.300> to<00:01:22.450> go<00:01:24.360> now<00:01:25.360> that<00:01:25.390> my<00:01:25.720> polar<00:01:25.990> pure<00:01:26.320> has

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
ready to go now that my polar pure has

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.230 
ready to go now that my polar pure has
been<00:01:26.650> sitting<00:01:26.950> for<00:01:27.160> one<00:01:27.310> hour<00:01:27.520> it's<00:01:27.820> ready<00:01:28.120> to

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
been sitting for one hour it's ready to

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.300 
been sitting for one hour it's ready to
use<00:01:28.360> so<00:01:29.260> I'm<00:01:29.350> going<00:01:29.500> to<00:01:29.560> pick<00:01:29.740> up<00:01:29.770> the<00:01:29.980> bottle

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
use so I'm going to pick up the bottle

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.820 
use so I'm going to pick up the bottle
and<00:01:30.460> look<00:01:30.730> at<00:01:30.880> how<00:01:31.210> much<00:01:31.420> I<00:01:31.690> need<00:01:32.110> to<00:01:32.140> put<00:01:32.350> into

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
and look at how much I need to put into

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.300 
and look at how much I need to put into
one<00:01:33.580> quart<00:01:33.970> the<00:01:34.240> warmer<00:01:35.080> my<00:01:35.230> solution<00:01:35.830> the

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
one quart the warmer my solution the

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.460 
one quart the warmer my solution the
less<00:01:36.550> I'll<00:01:36.790> use<00:01:37.090> so<00:01:37.720> if<00:01:37.840> you're<00:01:37.990> in<00:01:38.170> cold

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
less I'll use so if you're in cold

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.050 
less I'll use so if you're in cold
weather

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
weather

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.310

keep<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:40.210> pole<00:01:40.390> up<00:01:40.510> here<00:01:40.690> next<00:01:40.990> to<00:01:41.080> you<00:01:41.170> so

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
keep the pole up here next to you so

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.250 
keep the pole up here next to you so
that<00:01:41.470> it<00:01:41.590> will<00:01:41.680> stay<00:01:41.920> warm<00:01:42.480> right<00:01:43.480> here<00:01:43.870> it

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
that it will stay warm right here it

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.980 
that it will stay warm right here it
says<00:01:44.590> that<00:01:44.770> I<00:01:44.800> need<00:01:44.890> two<00:01:45.280> and<00:01:45.430> a<00:01:45.460> half<00:01:45.670> capfuls

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
says that I need two and a half capfuls

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.760 
says that I need two and a half capfuls
per<00:01:46.990> quart<00:01:47.320> so<00:01:47.980> I<00:01:48.010> take<00:01:48.310> the<00:01:48.460> lid<00:01:48.670> off<00:01:48.700> and

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
per quart so I take the lid off and

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:57.060 
per quart so I take the lid off and
measure<00:01:50.770> out<00:01:51.070> two<00:01:53.190> and<00:01:54.190> a<00:01:54.220> half<00:01:54.400> capfuls<00:01:56.070> pour

that<00:01:57.220> in<00:01:58.050> let<00:01:59.050> my<00:01:59.230> water<00:01:59.530> sit<00:02:00.370> for<00:02:00.580> 20<00:02:01.000> minutes

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
that in let my water sit for 20 minutes

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.540 
that in let my water sit for 20 minutes
and<00:02:01.630> then<00:02:02.230> it's<00:02:02.380> ready<00:02:02.590> to<00:02:02.710> drink<00:02:02.830> and<00:02:03.400> you
