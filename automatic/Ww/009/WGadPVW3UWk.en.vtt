00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.040 

I've<00:00:06.250> done<00:00:06.430> a<00:00:06.460> little<00:00:06.670> 12<00:00:07.300> volt<00:00:07.540> power<00:00:07.750> right

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:08.050 
I've done a little 12 volt power right

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.650 
I've done a little 12 volt power right
there<00:00:08.220> so<00:00:09.220> he<00:00:09.370> can<00:00:09.550> see<00:00:09.670> basically<00:00:10.000> see<00:00:10.300> how<00:00:10.480> it

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:10.660 
there so he can see basically see how it

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.660 
there so he can see basically see how it
works<00:00:11.040> go<00:00:12.059> from<00:00:13.059> normal<00:00:13.389> to<00:00:13.690> high<00:00:13.840> beams<00:00:14.670> that

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:15.670 
works go from normal to high beams that

00:00:15.670 --> 00:01:12.210 
works go from normal to high beams that
basically<00:00:16.209> all<00:00:16.920> that<00:00:17.920> happens

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.130 

and<00:01:12.850> I<00:01:13.090> had<00:01:13.210> the<00:01:13.330> left<00:01:13.570> light<00:01:13.780> completely

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
and I had the left light completely

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.220 
and I had the left light completely
covered<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:15.760> it<00:01:15.850> won't<00:01:16.030> affect<00:01:16.180> the<00:01:16.990> light

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.230 
covered so it won't affect the light

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.510 
covered so it won't affect the light
that<00:01:17.440> I'm<00:01:17.560> going<00:01:17.710> to<00:01:17.770> show<00:01:17.920> you<00:01:17.950> this<00:01:18.340> is<00:01:18.490> the

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
that I'm going to show you this is the

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.760 
that I'm going to show you this is the
normal<00:01:19.180> amount<00:01:19.720> of<00:01:19.900> light<00:01:20.170> that<00:01:20.470> they<00:01:20.650> had

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
normal amount of light that they had

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.070 
normal amount of light that they had
like<00:01:20.950> gifts<00:01:21.640> I'm<00:01:22.030> about<00:01:22.450> twelve<00:01:22.870> and<00:01:22.960> a<00:01:23.050> half

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
like gifts I'm about twelve and a half

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.530 
like gifts I'm about twelve and a half
meters<00:01:23.620> away<00:01:23.950> from<00:01:24.100> the<00:01:24.310> wall<00:01:24.580> so<00:01:25.180> it's<00:01:25.330> about

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
meters away from the wall so it's about

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.500 
meters away from the wall so it's about
two<00:01:25.840> and<00:01:25.870> a<00:01:26.020> half<00:01:26.080> car<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:27.700> between<00:01:28.120> me<00:01:28.330> and<00:01:28.360> the

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
two and a half car in between me and the

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.340 
two and a half car in between me and the
wall<00:01:28.690> and<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:30.400> pulled<00:01:31.000> the<00:01:31.090> high<00:01:31.330> beam<00:01:31.570> bulb<00:01:31.930> so

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
wall and I pulled the high beam bulb so

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.990 
wall and I pulled the high beam bulb so
it<00:01:32.620> won't<00:01:32.830> affect<00:01:32.950> the<00:01:33.400> light<00:01:33.580> that<00:01:33.760> I'm<00:01:33.850> going

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
it won't affect the light that I'm going

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.510 
it won't affect the light that I'm going
to<00:01:34.060> show<00:01:34.210> you<00:01:34.240> that's<00:01:35.110> my<00:01:35.320> high<00:01:35.530> beam<00:01:35.770> with

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
to show you that's my high beam with

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.600 
to show you that's my high beam with
just<00:01:36.820> one<00:01:37.210> headlight<00:01:37.600> and<00:01:38.320> you<00:01:39.010> can<00:01:39.130> flick<00:01:39.460> it

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
just one headlight and you can flick it

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.900 
just one headlight and you can flick it
really<00:01:40.480> quickly<00:01:40.930> and<00:01:41.400> now<00:01:42.400> I'm<00:01:42.550> going<00:01:42.700> to<00:01:42.760> show

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
really quickly and now I'm going to show

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.780 
really quickly and now I'm going to show
you<00:01:42.940> the<00:01:43.480> left<00:01:43.870> side<00:01:44.080> stock<00:01:44.560> side<00:01:44.860> with<00:01:45.310> the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
you the left side stock side with the

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.660 
you the left side stock side with the
high<00:01:46.330> beam<00:01:46.600> so<00:01:47.110> this<00:01:47.380> is<00:01:47.560> just<00:01:47.980> the<00:01:48.130> left<00:01:48.400> side

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
high beam so this is just the left side

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.480 
high beam so this is just the left side
of<00:01:49.030> the<00:01:49.300> of<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:49.750> headlight<00:01:50.110> with<00:01:51.010> a<00:01:51.040> normal

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
of the of the headlight with a normal

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:58.460 
of the of the headlight with a normal
xenon<00:01:51.880> on<00:01:52.090> and<00:01:52.830> that<00:01:53.830> is<00:01:54.070> the<00:01:54.220> high<00:01:54.370> beam<00:01:54.640> and

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.260 

now<00:01:59.470> I'm<00:01:59.590> gonna<00:01:59.740> put<00:02:00.220> them<00:02:00.310> both<00:02:00.610> on<00:02:00.670> so<00:02:01.180> you

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
now I'm gonna put them both on so you

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.000 
now I'm gonna put them both on so you
can<00:02:01.420> see<00:02:01.690> the<00:02:01.810> big<00:02:01.960> difference<00:02:01.990> all<00:02:02.710> right

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
can see the big difference all right

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.850 
can see the big difference all right
both<00:02:03.250> the<00:02:03.520> lights<00:02:03.729> are<00:02:03.910> on<00:02:03.940> now<00:02:04.270> I'm<00:02:04.990> still<00:02:05.320> on

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
both the lights are on now I'm still on

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.310 
both the lights are on now I'm still on
the<00:02:06.010> right<00:02:06.160> side<00:02:06.460> no<00:02:06.970> high<00:02:07.240> beam<00:02:07.479> bulb<00:02:07.750> just

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
the right side no high beam bulb just

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:14.220 
the right side no high beam bulb just
purely<00:02:08.740> the<00:02:09.670> bi-xenon<00:02:09.850> lens<00:02:12.090> as<00:02:13.090> you<00:02:13.570> can<00:02:13.990> see

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
purely the bi-xenon lens as you can see

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.729 
purely the bi-xenon lens as you can see
my<00:02:15.220> normal<00:02:16.030> high<00:02:16.630> beam<00:02:16.870> is<00:02:17.050> right<00:02:17.290> there<00:02:17.560> and

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
my normal high beam is right there and

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.630 
my normal high beam is right there and
the<00:02:18.100> rest<00:02:18.310> is<00:02:18.580> all<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:19.360> xenon<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:21.370> can<00:02:21.520> also

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
the rest is all the xenon you can also

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.880 
the rest is all the xenon you can also
see<00:02:21.970> it<00:02:22.090> when<00:02:22.239> you<00:02:22.330> flick<00:02:22.570> it<00:02:22.600> you<00:02:23.470> can<00:02:23.620> see<00:02:23.770> the

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
see it when you flick it you can see the

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.330 
see it when you flick it you can see the
little<00:02:24.010> dot<00:02:24.340> appear<00:02:25.470> so<00:02:26.470> it's<00:02:26.680> a<00:02:26.800> major

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
little dot appear so it's a major

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.330 
little dot appear so it's a major
improvement<00:02:28.120> but<00:02:28.959> Wendy<00:02:29.230> here<00:02:29.440> but<00:02:29.650> I<00:02:29.680> hope<00:02:29.950> I

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
improvement but Wendy here but I hope I

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.880 
improvement but Wendy here but I hope I
can<00:02:30.520> show<00:02:30.730> you<00:02:30.790> at<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:31.900> right<00:02:32.050> way<00:02:32.260> normal

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
can show you at the right way normal

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.140 
can show you at the right way normal
xenon<00:02:33.370> lights<00:02:33.580> I'm<00:02:34.390> covering<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:35.170> old<00:02:35.440> one<00:02:35.739> so

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
xenon lights I'm covering the old one so

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.770 
xenon lights I'm covering the old one so
that<00:02:37.150> was<00:02:37.360> me<00:02:37.840> covering<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.380> old<00:02:38.470> one<00:02:39.780> and

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
that was me covering the old one and

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.440 
that was me covering the old one and
then<00:02:41.050> I'm<00:02:41.320> gonna<00:02:41.440> cover<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.850> new<00:02:43.030> lens<00:02:45.450> see

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
then I'm gonna cover the new lens see

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.390 
then I'm gonna cover the new lens see
what<00:02:46.600> an<00:02:46.690> enormous<00:02:47.200> amount<00:02:47.470> of<00:02:47.709> light<00:02:48.130> that

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
what an enormous amount of light that

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.060 
what an enormous amount of light that
you<00:02:48.850> get<00:02:48.970> X<00:02:49.209> right<00:02:49.420> here

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:03:03.240 

and<00:02:54.070> then<00:02:54.190> this<00:02:54.850> is<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.120> old<00:02:55.240> one<00:03:00.000> new<00:03:01.000> one
