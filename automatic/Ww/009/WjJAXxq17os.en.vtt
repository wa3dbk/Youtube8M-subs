 with tensions on the trinity in the first steps 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.650

 Almost all will tell about decrease 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:26.439
 not only me 

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:29.309
 in fact 

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:31.649
 developed over the years 

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:33.759
 with time 

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:36.089

 theft 

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:40.309
 personality of the very inspiration which I 

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:41.849
 spoke 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.310
 the fact is that after the end of a career 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.229
 Anna Bessonova 

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:49.069
 Yes, and in April, the continuation of a career 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:50.839
 it's a gymnast's decline 

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:52.749
 Ukrainian gymnastics is obvious 

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:55.289
 was in decline 

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:57.609
 after it became clear 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:00.379
 performance in Italy 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:03.610
 and if Alina Maksimenko as a leader 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:06.150
 the current Ukrainian team in general 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.370
 then just hope that 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.279
 will receive medals 

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:14.279
 coach of the Ukrainian team and gymnasts 

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:17.609
 worked very hard on it 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.389
 team result 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.549
 I want to say that after qualifying in 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.129
 two kinds of hoops in a ball 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:25.909
 Ukraine goes to the team competition 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:28.409
 third place if you have the words who it is 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:29.829
 there will be a breakthrough 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:31.169
 well at least the current performance 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:33.220
 torrential maximenko 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.700
 will not affect the team result 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:35.590
 of Ukraine
