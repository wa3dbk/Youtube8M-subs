in this section or in this lesson I

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.059 
in this section or in this lesson I
should<00:00:03.959> say<00:00:04.140> I'm<00:00:04.380> going<00:00:04.589> to<00:00:04.650> show<00:00:04.920> you<00:00:04.980> a

should say I'm going to show you a
little<00:00:05.220> bit<00:00:05.400> about<00:00:05.460> the<00:00:05.730> select<00:00:06.500> section<00:00:07.820> so

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
little bit about the select section so

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.000 
little bit about the select section so
let's<00:00:08.849> pull<00:00:09.150> up<00:00:09.179> a<00:00:09.559> picture<00:00:10.559> let's<00:00:10.740> pull<00:00:10.980> up

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
let's pull up a picture let's pull up

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.279 
let's pull up a picture let's pull up
the<00:00:11.219> lake<00:00:14.179> now<00:00:15.179> if<00:00:15.269> we<00:00:15.360> go<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.480> select<00:00:15.929> we<00:00:16.260> can

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
the lake now if we go to select we can

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.929 
the lake now if we go to select we can
select<00:00:16.800> all<00:00:17.039> obviously<00:00:18.000> that's<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.600> no-brainer

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
select all obviously that's a no-brainer

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.429 
select all obviously that's a no-brainer
deselect<00:00:20.939> so<00:00:21.720> if<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:21.900> have<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.050> section

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
deselect so if you have a section

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.300 
deselect so if you have a section
selected<00:00:23.010> that's<00:00:23.160> how<00:00:23.430> you<00:00:23.490> would<00:00:23.699> deselect

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
selected that's how you would deselect

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.810 
selected that's how you would deselect
reselect<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:26.779> know<00:00:27.779> not<00:00:28.019> very<00:00:28.230> hard<00:00:28.410> huh

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
reselect I know not very hard huh

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.099 
reselect I know not very hard huh
inverse<00:00:29.820> now<00:00:30.240> that's<00:00:30.390> what<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:30.570> want<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:30.900> show

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
inverse now that's what I want to show

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.880 
inverse now that's what I want to show
you<00:00:31.489> so<00:00:32.489> let's<00:00:33.210> grab<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.480> magic<00:00:34.079> wand<00:00:34.380> tool

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
you so let's grab the magic wand tool

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.810 
you so let's grab the magic wand tool
and<00:00:36.230> let's<00:00:37.230> see<00:00:37.440> how<00:00:37.620> let's<00:00:38.280> try<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.460> select

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
and let's see how let's try to select

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.869 
and let's see how let's try to select
the<00:00:39.030> sky<00:00:39.390> area<00:00:39.690> there<00:00:40.440> we<00:00:40.559> go<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.489> happened

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
the sky area there we go so it happened

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.779 
the sky area there we go so it happened
to<00:00:41.940> be<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.059> our<00:00:42.180> tolerance<00:00:42.480> was<00:00:42.960> perfect<00:00:43.789> 75

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
to be that our tolerance was perfect 75

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.090 
to be that our tolerance was perfect 75
so<00:00:45.420> now<00:00:45.570> any<00:00:45.899> modifications<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.710> do<00:00:46.920> will

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
so now any modifications you do will

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.139 
so now any modifications you do will
only<00:00:47.129> be<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:48.000> selected<00:00:48.840> section<00:00:50.149> but

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
only be to this selected section but

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.000 
only be to this selected section but
let's<00:00:51.570> say<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.840> wanted<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.320> reverse<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.949> that

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
let's say you wanted the reverse of that

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.580 
let's say you wanted the reverse of that
you<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.969> wanted<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.480> modify<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:55.020> other

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
you you wanted to modify this other

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.709 
you you wanted to modify this other
section<00:00:55.920> well<00:00:56.699> rather<00:00:56.850> than<00:00:57.090> using<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.360> magic

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
section well rather than using the magic

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.000 
section well rather than using the magic
wand<00:00:57.750> tool<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.260> trying<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.590> grab<00:00:58.800> each

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
wand tool and trying to grab each

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.290 
wand tool and trying to grab each
section<00:00:59.520> over<00:00:59.730> here<00:00:59.760> which<00:01:00.090> would<00:01:00.239> be

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
section over here which would be

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.670 
section over here which would be
difficult<00:01:01.109> because<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.350> have<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.469> lot<00:01:01.590> of

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
difficult because you have a lot of

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.950 
difficult because you have a lot of
different<00:01:01.949> colors<00:01:02.480> you<00:01:03.480> could<00:01:03.690> use<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
different colors you could use the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.850 
different colors you could use the
magnetic<00:01:04.199> lasso<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.860> do<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.880> but<00:01:06.720> if<00:01:07.650> you

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
magnetic lasso to do that but if you

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
magnetic lasso to do that but if you
just<00:01:08.040> go<00:01:08.220> select<00:01:08.750> inverse<00:01:10.010> well<00:01:11.010> now<00:01:11.250> it's

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
just go select inverse well now it's

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.359 
just go select inverse well now it's
selected<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.570> opposite<00:01:13.170> section<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:13.890> in<00:01:14.189> a

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
selected the opposite section so in a

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.920 
selected the opposite section so in a
case<00:01:14.580> like<00:01:14.610> this<00:01:14.820> where<00:01:15.180> it's<00:01:15.270> easy<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.659> just

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
case like this where it's easy to just

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.499 
case like this where it's easy to just
select<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.409> sky<00:01:16.680> because<00:01:16.950> it's<00:01:17.130> all<00:01:17.390> you<00:01:18.390> know

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
select the sky because it's all you know

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.039 
select the sky because it's all you know
in<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.810> same<00:01:19.020> color<00:01:19.259> range<00:01:20.030> then<00:01:21.030> if<00:01:21.390> you

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
in the same color range then if you

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.130 
in the same color range then if you
inverse<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.740> then<00:01:23.640> you're<00:01:24.210> selecting<00:01:24.780> all<00:01:24.960> of

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
inverse it then you're selecting all of

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.429 
inverse it then you're selecting all of
this<00:01:25.259> without<00:01:25.470> having<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.100> individually<00:01:27.439> you

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
this without having to individually you

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.710 
this without having to individually you
know<00:01:28.500> pick<00:01:29.040> each<00:01:29.430> colored<00:01:30.000> section<00:01:30.479> with<00:01:30.600> the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
know pick each colored section with the

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.109 
know pick each colored section with the
magic<00:01:31.020> wand<00:01:31.229> or<00:01:31.500> however<00:01:31.860> else<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.189> might<00:01:32.880> do

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
we don't have any layers but from here

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.100 
we don't have any layers but from here
you<00:01:41.130> could<00:01:41.400> select<00:01:41.610> all<00:01:42.060> layers<00:01:42.420> similar

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
you could select all layers similar

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.550 
you could select all layers similar
layers<00:01:43.640> deselect<00:01:44.640> layers<00:01:45.110> now<00:01:46.110> let's

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
layers deselect layers now let's

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.870 
layers deselect layers now let's
deselect<00:01:48.110> now<00:01:49.110> I'm<00:01:49.229> going<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.439> show<00:01:49.590> you

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.760 
deselect now I'm going to show you
select<00:01:50.880> color<00:01:51.420> range<00:01:51.570> now<00:01:52.470> this<00:01:52.619> is

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
select color range now this is

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.450 
select color range now this is
interesting<00:01:53.600> so<00:01:54.770> see<00:01:55.770> how<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.890> eyedropper

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
interesting so see how the eyedropper

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.399 
interesting so see how the eyedropper
tool<00:01:56.640> has<00:01:56.759> come<00:01:56.909> up

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
tool has come up

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.210 
tool has come up
well<00:01:58.409> now<00:01:59.360> keep<00:02:00.360> this<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.780> selection

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
well now keep this to selection

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.770 
well now keep this to selection
and<00:02:03.050> if<00:02:04.050> we<00:02:04.200> click<00:02:04.410> anywhere<00:02:05.090> it's<00:02:06.090> selecting

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
and if we click anywhere it's selecting

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.560 
and if we click anywhere it's selecting
similar<00:02:07.440> colors<00:02:07.920> or<00:02:08.340> colors<00:02:08.850> in<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.180> certain

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
similar colors or colors in a certain

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.550 
similar colors or colors in a certain
range<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.550> I<00:02:12.050> happen<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.080> pick<00:02:13.320> the<00:02:13.530> the

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
range and I happen to pick the the

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.830 
range and I happen to pick the the
mountains

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
mountains

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:23.990 
mountains
so<00:02:16.370> let's<00:02:22.460> basically<00:02:23.460> I<00:02:23.490> don't<00:02:23.580> want<00:02:23.880> the

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
so let's basically I don't want the

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.210 
so let's basically I don't want the
mountains<00:02:24.360> I<00:02:24.510> want<00:02:24.690> this<00:02:24.780> guy<00:02:25.080> so<00:02:26.040> I'm<00:02:26.100> going

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
mountains I want this guy so I'm going

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.670 
mountains I want this guy so I'm going
to<00:02:26.250> click<00:02:26.400> up<00:02:26.580> there<00:02:26.990> now<00:02:27.990> if<00:02:28.050> you<00:02:28.140> notice<00:02:28.440> it

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
to click up there now if you notice it

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.890 
to click up there now if you notice it
picked<00:02:29.220> that<00:02:29.400> color<00:02:29.700> range<00:02:30.090> up<00:02:30.420> there<00:02:30.690> in<00:02:30.810> the

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
picked that color range up there in the

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.130 
picked that color range up there in the
sky<00:02:31.230> but<00:02:32.040> left<00:02:32.340> out<00:02:32.610> this<00:02:33.540> little<00:02:33.810> section

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
sky but left out this little section

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.360 
sky but left out this little section
here<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:36.150> section<00:02:36.180> below<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:37.340> which<00:02:38.340> is

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
here and the section below it which is

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.420 
here and the section below it which is
fine<00:02:38.760> for<00:02:39.570> this<00:02:39.720> for<00:02:40.470> this<00:02:40.560> case<00:02:40.830> but<00:02:41.130> I<00:02:41.340> can

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
fine for this for this case but I can

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.130 
fine for this for this case but I can
show<00:02:41.760> you<00:02:41.850> what<00:02:42.000> fuzziness<00:02:42.510> does<00:02:42.750> see<00:02:43.050> it

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
show you what fuzziness does see it

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.440 
show you what fuzziness does see it
brings<00:02:43.380> in<00:02:43.560> more<00:02:43.830> colors<00:02:44.280> in<00:02:44.310> that<00:02:44.760> range

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
brings in more colors in that range

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.300 
brings in more colors in that range
so<00:02:45.960> you<00:02:46.020> virtually<00:02:46.500> selected<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:47.160> whole

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
so you virtually selected the whole

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.010 
so you virtually selected the whole
picture<00:02:47.930> but<00:02:48.930> I<00:02:49.140> want<00:02:49.590> just<00:02:49.860> that<00:02:49.920> sky<00:02:50.340> section

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
picture but I want just that sky section

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.200 
picture but I want just that sky section
maybe<00:02:52.020> a<00:02:52.170> little<00:02:52.470> bit<00:02:52.590> of<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.740> water<00:02:53.210> because

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
maybe a little bit of the water because

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
maybe a little bit of the water because
what<00:02:54.330> I<00:02:54.360> want<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:54.600> do<00:02:54.750> is<00:02:54.870> I<00:02:54.960> want<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:55.170> change

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
what I want to do is I want to change

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.940 
what I want to do is I want to change
the<00:02:55.650> color<00:02:55.860> of<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.040> sky<00:02:56.450> so<00:02:57.450> that's<00:02:58.350> just

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
the color of the sky so that's just

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.090 
the color of the sky so that's just
selecting<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.580> range<00:02:59.790> of<00:03:00.060> colors<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.920> you<00:03:01.920> can

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
selecting a range of colors and you can

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.680 
selecting a range of colors and you can
select<00:03:02.250> your<00:03:02.460> fuzziness<00:03:02.970> to<00:03:03.090> determine<00:03:03.540> how

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
select your fuzziness to determine how

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.860 
select your fuzziness to determine how
broad<00:03:04.080> of<00:03:04.350> a<00:03:04.620> range<00:03:04.860> of<00:03:05.100> color<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:05.970> then<00:03:06.750> you

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
broad of a range of color and then you

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.900 
broad of a range of color and then you
can<00:03:06.989> add<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.530> it<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:08.160> know<00:03:08.280> click<00:03:08.550> here<00:03:08.790> and

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
can add to it you know click here and

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.870 
can add to it you know click here and
you<00:03:08.970> could<00:03:09.090> add<00:03:09.300> a<00:03:09.330> little<00:03:09.480> bit<00:03:09.630> more<00:03:09.930> there

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
you could add a little bit more there

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.880 
you could add a little bit more there
you<00:03:11.880> can<00:03:12.060> subtract<00:03:12.630> a<00:03:12.930> range<00:03:13.350> of<00:03:13.530> colors<00:03:13.860> so

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
you can subtract a range of colors so

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:21.040 
you can subtract a range of colors so
I'm<00:03:14.160> gonna<00:03:14.280> go<00:03:14.700> back<00:03:14.940> in<00:03:15.500> subtract<00:03:18.590> subtract

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
I'm gonna go back in subtract subtract

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
I'm gonna go back in subtract subtract
that's<00:03:22.050> pretty<00:03:22.350> good<00:03:22.560> right<00:03:22.620> there

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
that's pretty good right there

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.650 
that's pretty good right there
a<00:03:23.250> little<00:03:23.730> bit<00:03:23.850> of<00:03:23.940> reflection<00:03:24.120> in<00:03:24.420> the<00:03:24.510> water

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
a little bit of reflection in the water

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.370 
a little bit of reflection in the water
and<00:03:24.959> a<00:03:25.170> little<00:03:25.290> bit<00:03:25.380> most<00:03:25.920> of<00:03:26.070> the<00:03:26.130> sky<00:03:26.370> so<00:03:27.380> now

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
and a little bit most of the sky so now

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.810 
and a little bit most of the sky so now
I'm<00:03:28.709> gonna<00:03:28.830> try<00:03:29.040> to<00:03:29.100> change<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.580> color<00:03:29.760> of

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
I'm gonna try to change the color of

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
I'm gonna try to change the color of
this<00:03:29.940> guy<00:03:30.090> give<00:03:30.330> it<00:03:30.420> a<00:03:30.450> little<00:03:30.540> bit<00:03:30.720> of<00:03:30.780> a

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
this guy give it a little bit of a

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.900 
this guy give it a little bit of a
sunset<00:03:31.230> so<00:03:31.530> in<00:03:32.220> this<00:03:32.310> case<00:03:32.550> that's<00:03:32.730> good

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
sunset so in this case that's good

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.600 
sunset so in this case that's good
enough<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:33.420> I'm<00:03:33.870> gonna<00:03:33.989> hit<00:03:34.200> ok<00:03:34.500> now<00:03:35.370> it's

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
enough and I'm gonna hit ok now it's

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.509 
enough and I'm gonna hit ok now it's
selected<00:03:36.180> those<00:03:36.870> sections<00:03:38.750> and<00:03:39.750> now<00:03:40.519> I'm

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
selected those sections and now I'm

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:46.370 
selected those sections and now I'm
going<00:03:41.850> to<00:03:41.970> add<00:03:42.150> a<00:03:44.000> new<00:03:45.000> layer<00:03:45.239> or<00:03:45.959> actually<00:03:46.290> I'm

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
going to add a new layer or actually I'm

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.910 
going to add a new layer or actually I'm
going<00:03:46.500> to<00:03:46.590> first<00:03:46.739> convert<00:03:47.220> this<00:03:47.430> layer

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.649 

let's<00:03:51.920> go<00:03:52.129> to<00:03:52.190> layer<00:03:52.519> you've<00:03:53.209> already<00:03:53.390> done

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:53.659 
let's go to layer you've already done

00:03:53.659 --> 00:04:01.490 
let's go to layer you've already done
this<00:03:55.780> duplicate<00:03:56.780> layer

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:09.320 

and<00:04:02.460> I'm<00:04:02.790> going<00:04:02.940> to<00:04:02.970> convert<00:04:03.180> it<00:04:08.030> layer<00:04:09.030> from

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
and I'm going to convert it layer from

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:16.039 
and I'm going to convert it layer from
backgrounds<00:04:10.160> so<00:04:11.160> there<00:04:11.730> we<00:04:11.850> go<00:04:11.880> now<00:04:14.780> in<00:04:15.780> this

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
backgrounds so there we go now in this

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.030 
backgrounds so there we go now in this
layer<00:04:16.260> from<00:04:16.500> background<00:04:16.590> I<00:04:18.470> am<00:04:19.470> going<00:04:19.769> to<00:04:19.890> add

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
layer from background I am going to add

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.770 
layer from background I am going to add
a<00:04:20.070> color<00:04:20.579> in<00:04:20.820> there<00:04:20.970> let's<00:04:21.239> add<00:04:21.420> a<00:04:21.450> nice

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
a color in there let's add a nice

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.770 
a color in there let's add a nice
magenta<00:04:23.180> pinkish<00:04:24.320> color<00:04:26.150> yeah<00:04:27.150> that<00:04:27.510> works

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
magenta pinkish color yeah that works

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:35.060 
magenta pinkish color yeah that works
right<00:04:27.990> there<00:04:28.370> all<00:04:29.370> right<00:04:31.190> now<00:04:33.830> I'm<00:04:34.830> going<00:04:35.010> to

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
right there all right now I'm going to

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.870 
right there all right now I'm going to
go

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:43.070 

what<00:04:38.880> is<00:04:38.970> it<00:04:39.090> that

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.930 

let<00:04:43.560> me<00:04:43.620> go<00:04:43.740> to<00:04:43.800> edit<00:04:44.220> fill<00:04:44.870> and<00:04:46.759> I'm<00:04:47.759> going<00:04:47.879> to

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
let me go to edit fill and I'm going to

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.580 
let me go to edit fill and I'm going to
fill<00:04:48.090> it<00:04:48.120> with<00:04:48.240> the<00:04:48.389> foreground<00:04:48.660> color<00:04:49.229> which

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
fill it with the foreground color which

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.110 
fill it with the foreground color which
I<00:04:49.740> already<00:04:49.949> selected<00:04:50.310> here<00:04:50.610> we've<00:04:50.759> used<00:04:50.789> this

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
I already selected here we've used this

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.610 
I already selected here we've used this
before<00:04:51.509> this<00:04:51.659> filler<00:04:51.990> and<00:04:54.289> I'm<00:04:55.289> going<00:04:55.470> to<00:04:55.530> make

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
before this filler and I'm going to make

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.379 
before this filler and I'm going to make
the<00:04:55.770> opacity<00:04:58.460> 60<00:04:59.460> instead<00:05:00.060> of<00:05:00.150> a<00:05:00.210> hundred

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
the opacity 60 instead of a hundred

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:08.140 
the opacity 60 instead of a hundred
percent<00:05:03.949> right<00:05:04.949> now<00:05:05.900> if<00:05:06.900> we<00:05:07.050> deselect<00:05:07.289> that

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
percent right now if we deselect that

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.219 
percent right now if we deselect that
now<00:05:09.150> we<00:05:09.210> see<00:05:11.240> how<00:05:12.240> I've<00:05:12.389> changed<00:05:12.419> the<00:05:12.960> sky

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:13.229 
now we see how I've changed the sky

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:14.749 
now we see how I've changed the sky
picture<00:05:13.680> a<00:05:13.710> little<00:05:13.860> bit<00:05:13.979> you<00:05:14.310> can<00:05:14.490> see<00:05:14.520> if

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:14.759 
picture a little bit you can see if

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:17.450 
picture a little bit you can see if
that's<00:05:14.940> satisfactory<00:05:15.479> by<00:05:15.900> going<00:05:16.169> select<00:05:16.560> and

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
that's satisfactory by going select and

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.809 
that's satisfactory by going select and
deselect<00:05:18.770> now<00:05:19.770> we've<00:05:19.919> added<00:05:20.130> a<00:05:20.370> little<00:05:20.490> bit<00:05:20.699> of

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:20.819 
deselect now we've added a little bit of

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:25.850 
deselect now we've added a little bit of
color<00:05:21.030> that<00:05:21.270> sky<00:05:24.080> and<00:05:25.080> a<00:05:25.259> little<00:05:25.470> bit<00:05:25.620> to<00:05:25.770> the

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
color that sky and a little bit to the

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:31.879 
color that sky and a little bit to the
lake<00:05:26.069> so<00:05:28.220> there's<00:05:29.220> one<00:05:29.460> example<00:05:29.580> of<00:05:30.030> using<00:05:30.900> the

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:31.889 
lake so there's one example of using the

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:35.539 
lake so there's one example of using the
color<00:05:32.130> range<00:05:32.430> under<00:05:33.060> selection
