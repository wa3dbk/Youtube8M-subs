00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
practice runs coming down the track so

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.999 
practice runs coming down the track so
it's<00:00:29.329> at<00:00:29.419> a<00:00:29.449> lot<00:00:29.660> of<00:00:29.779> where<00:00:29.989> it's<00:00:30.529> also<00:00:30.710> been

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
it's at a lot of where it's also been

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:32.139 
it's at a lot of where it's also been
really<00:00:31.399> hot<00:00:31.579> as<00:00:31.730> one<00:00:31.849> of<00:00:31.879> the<00:00:32.000> hottest

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
really hot as one of the hottest

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.330 
really hot as one of the hottest
weekends<00:00:32.629> we've<00:00:32.809> had<00:00:32.930> all<00:00:33.079> year<00:00:33.340> soaring

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
weekends we've had all year soaring

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.740 
weekends we've had all year soaring
temperatures<00:00:34.850> meant<00:00:35.059> that<00:00:35.239> the<00:00:35.300> track<00:00:35.510> dried

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
temperatures meant that the track dried

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.959 
temperatures meant that the track dried
out<00:00:35.780> and<00:00:36.020> was<00:00:36.350> really<00:00:36.620> really<00:00:36.800> dusty<00:00:37.219> what

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
out and was really really dusty what

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:39.010 
out and was really really dusty what
we're<00:00:38.120> going<00:00:38.210> to<00:00:38.300> have<00:00:38.329> a<00:00:38.420> look<00:00:38.570> at<00:00:38.719> today<00:00:38.989> is

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
we're going to have a look at today is

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.660 
we're going to have a look at today is
just<00:00:39.410> a<00:00:39.500> few<00:00:39.739> of<00:00:39.770> the<00:00:39.950> techniques<00:00:40.340> that<00:00:40.460> can

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
just a few of the techniques that can

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.880 
just a few of the techniques that can
get<00:00:40.820> the<00:00:40.940> track<00:00:41.149> back<00:00:41.360> into<00:00:41.719> shape<00:00:41.930> and<00:00:42.260> also

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
get the track back into shape and also

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.260 
get the track back into shape and also
take<00:00:43.129> advantage<00:00:43.280> of<00:00:43.670> the<00:00:43.789> fact<00:00:43.940> that<00:00:44.090> the

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
take advantage of the fact that the

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.300 
take advantage of the fact that the
riders<00:00:44.719> really<00:00:45.170> kind<00:00:45.410> of<00:00:45.530> carved<00:00:46.010> their<00:00:46.129> own

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:46.310 
riders really kind of carved their own

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.370 
riders really kind of carved their own
way<00:00:46.730> through<00:00:47.090> this<00:00:47.239> track<00:00:47.570> and<00:00:47.870> what<00:00:48.110> we<00:00:48.200> can

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:48.380 
way through this track and what we can

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.990 
way through this track and what we can
do<00:00:48.530> to<00:00:48.680> just<00:00:48.860> pick<00:00:49.070> it<00:00:49.100> a<00:00:49.250> little<00:00:49.370> bit<00:00:49.550> smoother

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
do to just pick it a little bit smoother

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.819 
do to just pick it a little bit smoother
to<00:00:50.810> begin<00:00:51.079> with<00:00:51.230> what<00:00:51.440> we're<00:00:51.530> going<00:00:51.620> to<00:00:51.710> look

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
to begin with what we're going to look

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:53.979 
to begin with what we're going to look
at<00:00:52.040> here<00:00:52.340> are<00:00:52.850> these<00:00:53.000> series<00:00:53.480> of<00:00:53.510> braking

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
at here are these series of braking

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.020 
at here are these series of braking
bumps<00:00:54.140> that<00:00:54.410> come<00:00:54.620> down<00:00:54.800> over<00:00:55.010> the<00:00:55.220> hill<00:00:55.370> just

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
bumps that come down over the hill just

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.670 
bumps that come down over the hill just
how<00:00:56.149> we<00:00:56.300> can<00:00:56.480> take<00:00:56.750> those<00:00:56.960> out<00:00:57.170> a<00:00:57.230> little<00:00:57.470> bit

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
how we can take those out a little bit

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.740 
how we can take those out a little bit
and<00:00:57.829> smooth<00:00:58.100> them<00:00:58.310> off<00:00:58.460> but<00:00:58.910> also<00:00:59.090> use<00:00:59.510> this

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
and smooth them off but also use this

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.120 
and smooth them off but also use this
bit<00:00:59.989> here<00:01:00.020> where<00:01:00.470> the<00:01:00.590> riders<00:01:00.980> have<00:01:01.100> been

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
bit here where the riders have been

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.940 
bit here where the riders have been
through<00:01:01.579> just<00:01:02.270> to<00:01:02.390> keep<00:01:02.660> this<00:01:02.899> legend<00:01:03.440> but

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:03.950 
through just to keep this legend but

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.679 
through just to keep this legend but
making<00:01:04.280> it<00:01:04.339> so<00:01:04.519> the<00:01:04.640> riders<00:01:05.000> can<00:01:05.149> still<00:01:05.449> set

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
making it so the riders can still set

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:07.600 
making it so the riders can still set
themselves<00:01:05.930> up<00:01:06.290> for<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:06.590> turn<00:01:06.799> and<00:01:07.130> then<00:01:07.430> just

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
themselves up for the turn and then just

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.830 
themselves up for the turn and then just
have<00:01:07.759> a<00:01:07.790> little<00:01:08.000> bit<00:01:08.210> of<00:01:08.240> a<00:01:08.360> look<00:01:08.509> at<00:01:08.659> how<00:01:08.780> we

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
have a little bit of a look at how we

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.899 
have a little bit of a look at how we
can<00:01:08.960> tune<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:09.380> turn<00:01:09.740> up<00:01:09.979> and<00:01:10.369> get<00:01:10.579> the<00:01:10.670> track

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
can tune the turn up and get the track

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.179 
can tune the turn up and get the track
back<00:01:11.090> into<00:01:11.420> shape<00:01:11.630> nothing<00:01:12.500> too<00:01:12.649> much<00:01:12.860> it's

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
back into shape nothing too much it's

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:14.920 
back into shape nothing too much it's
all<00:01:13.280> about<00:01:13.310> that<00:01:13.700> light<00:01:13.880> touch<00:01:14.180> again<00:01:14.509> we

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
all about that light touch again we

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.270 
all about that light touch again we
don't<00:01:14.990> wanna<00:01:15.170> be<00:01:15.259> out<00:01:15.380> here<00:01:15.560> for<00:01:15.799> hours<00:01:15.829> but

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
don't wanna be out here for hours but

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.889 
don't wanna be out here for hours but
just<00:01:16.490> a<00:01:16.579> little<00:01:16.880> bit<00:01:16.969> of<00:01:17.060> work<00:01:17.240> can<00:01:17.509> just<00:01:17.750> make

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
just a little bit of work can just make

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:19.300 
just a little bit of work can just make
a<00:01:17.930> massive<00:01:18.409> amount<00:01:18.679> of<00:01:18.740> difference<00:01:18.920> when<00:01:19.280> it

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
a massive amount of difference when it

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.709 
a massive amount of difference when it
comes<00:01:19.429> to<00:01:19.759> just<00:01:19.969> getting<00:01:20.179> your<00:01:20.270> tracks<00:01:20.509> in

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:20.719 
comes to just getting your tracks in

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:22.449 
comes to just getting your tracks in
shape<00:01:20.959> particularly<00:01:21.770> at<00:01:21.829> this<00:01:21.920> busy<00:01:22.159> time<00:01:22.399> of

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:22.459 
shape particularly at this busy time of

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:34.929 
shape particularly at this busy time of
year<00:01:32.079> so<00:01:33.079> phase<00:01:33.289> one<00:01:33.529> was<00:01:33.709> really<00:01:33.859> just<00:01:34.159> to<00:01:34.340> use

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
year so phase one was really just to use

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:36.459 
year so phase one was really just to use
the<00:01:35.149> McCloud<00:01:35.450> just<00:01:35.749> to<00:01:35.869> rake<00:01:36.109> the<00:01:36.139> dirt

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:36.469 
the McCloud just to rake the dirt

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:38.410 
the McCloud just to rake the dirt
through<00:01:36.799> the<00:01:36.859> trail<00:01:37.340> just<00:01:37.909> to<00:01:38.029> expose<00:01:38.389> what

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
through the trail just to expose what

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.120 
through the trail just to expose what
we're<00:01:38.749> working<00:01:38.869> on<00:01:39.170> here<00:01:39.409> with<00:01:39.560> these<00:01:39.649> braking

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
we're working on here with these braking

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.529 
we're working on here with these braking
bumps<00:01:40.279> this<00:01:40.549> is<00:01:40.700> quite<00:01:40.880> a<00:01:40.909> big<00:01:41.119> one<00:01:41.270> here<00:01:41.299> in

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
bumps this is quite a big one here in

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:43.510 
bumps this is quite a big one here in
front<00:01:41.749> of<00:01:41.869> us<00:01:41.959> nothing<00:01:42.799> too<00:01:42.950> bad<00:01:43.130> you<00:01:43.369> could

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
front of us nothing too bad you could

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.010 
front of us nothing too bad you could
get<00:01:43.700> away<00:01:43.789> of<00:01:43.999> leaving<00:01:44.359> it<00:01:44.450> but<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:44.719> problem

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
get away of leaving it but the problem

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.870 
get away of leaving it but the problem
is<00:01:45.139> is<00:01:45.349> when<00:01:45.469> it<00:01:45.619> rains<00:01:45.859> the<00:01:46.369> water<00:01:46.399> is<00:01:46.729> going

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
is is when it rains the water is going

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.969 
is is when it rains the water is going
to<00:01:46.939> wash<00:01:47.149> wash<00:01:47.479> down<00:01:47.749> the<00:01:47.779> hill<00:01:48.109> and<00:01:48.289> wash<00:01:48.950> away

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
to wash wash down the hill and wash away

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:50.980 
to wash wash down the hill and wash away
any<00:01:49.429> of<00:01:49.639> the<00:01:49.729> sediment<00:01:49.969> that's<00:01:50.270> been<00:01:50.539> blown

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
any of the sediment that's been blown

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.080 
any of the sediment that's been blown
out<00:01:51.200> by<00:01:51.259> all<00:01:51.619> the<00:01:51.740> riders<00:01:51.920> coming<00:01:52.399> through<00:01:52.429> so

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
out by all the riders coming through so

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.399 
out by all the riders coming through so
what<00:01:53.240> we're<00:01:53.359> looking<00:01:53.630> to<00:01:53.659> do<00:01:53.899> is<00:01:54.020> to<00:01:54.170> get<00:01:54.289> the

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
what we're looking to do is to get the

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.109 
what we're looking to do is to get the
track<00:01:54.619> ready<00:01:54.829> really<00:01:55.279> so<00:01:55.490> that<00:01:55.639> when<00:01:55.789> the<00:01:55.939> rain

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
track ready really so that when the rain

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.719 
track ready really so that when the rain
comes<00:01:56.389> down<00:01:56.539> it<00:01:57.349> washes<00:01:58.039> the<00:01:58.159> sediment<00:01:58.579> into

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
comes down it washes the sediment into

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.819 
comes down it washes the sediment into
the<00:01:58.999> trail<00:01:59.240> and<00:01:59.479> stops<00:01:59.990> this<00:02:00.200> from<00:02:00.439> washing

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
the trail and stops this from washing

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.159 
the trail and stops this from washing
out<00:02:00.950> further<00:02:01.219> again<00:02:02.029> downhill<00:02:02.599> tracks<00:02:02.929> not

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:03.169 
out further again downhill tracks not

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:04.719 
out further again downhill tracks not
going<00:02:03.319> to<00:02:03.380> make<00:02:03.529> a<00:02:03.560> lot<00:02:03.740> of<00:02:03.799> difference<00:02:04.249> but

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
going to make a lot of difference but

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:05.709 
going to make a lot of difference but
what<00:02:04.849> we're<00:02:04.999> looking<00:02:05.299> at<00:02:05.389> is<00:02:05.569> to

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
what we're looking at is to

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:07.539 
what we're looking at is to
sustainability<00:02:06.349> of<00:02:06.590> the<00:02:06.619> trail<00:02:06.950> so<00:02:07.279> we<00:02:07.369> don't

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
sustainability of the trail so we don't

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.400 
sustainability of the trail so we don't
want<00:02:07.700> to<00:02:07.759> leave<00:02:07.939> it<00:02:08.119> and<00:02:08.240> let<00:02:08.300> it<00:02:08.810> blow<00:02:09.080> further

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
want to leave it and let it blow further

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.320 
want to leave it and let it blow further

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
than coming fruit and really struggling

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.500 
than coming fruit and really struggling
with<00:02:19.010> this<00:02:19.190> it's<00:02:19.910> a<00:02:19.970> little<00:02:20.090> bit<00:02:20.270> of<00:02:20.420> an

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
with this it's a little bit of an

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
argument everyone always has should the

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:23.980 
argument everyone always has should the
track<00:02:22.310> be<00:02:22.460> left<00:02:22.670> really<00:02:23.030> gnarly<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:23.600> bumpy

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
track be left really gnarly and bumpy

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.140 
track be left really gnarly and bumpy
should<00:02:24.200> it<00:02:24.320> be<00:02:24.440> maintained<00:02:24.980> but<00:02:25.610> next<00:02:25.820> year

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
should it be maintained but next year

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.090 
should it be maintained but next year
the<00:02:26.330> race<00:02:26.780> isn't<00:02:27.050> going<00:02:27.230> to<00:02:27.290> be<00:02:27.410> till<00:02:27.620> sep<00:02:27.830> 10

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
the race isn't going to be till sep 10

the race isn't going to be till sep 10
coming<00:02:28.640> up<00:02:28.760> to<00:02:28.940> then<00:02:29.120> these<00:02:29.480> braking<00:02:29.960> bumps

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
coming up to then these braking bumps

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.570 
coming up to then these braking bumps
will<00:02:30.320> be<00:02:30.410> more<00:02:30.620> than<00:02:30.650> back<00:02:30.950> so<00:02:31.250> we're<00:02:31.400> just

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
will be more than back so we're just

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:32.800 
will be more than back so we're just
doing<00:02:31.730> a<00:02:31.790> little<00:02:31.970> bit<00:02:32.150> of<00:02:32.180> maintenance<00:02:32.390> just

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
doing a little bit of maintenance just

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.360 
doing a little bit of maintenance just
to<00:02:32.900> get<00:02:33.020> it<00:02:33.110> through<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.380> winter<00:02:33.560> just<00:02:34.190> to

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
to get it through the winter just to

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.070 
to get it through the winter just to
stop<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:34.790> trail<00:02:35.000> from<00:02:35.210> washing<00:02:35.570> away<00:02:35.690> and

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
stop the trail from washing away and

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.870 
stop the trail from washing away and
just<00:02:36.770> make<00:02:36.950> sure<00:02:37.130> everything's<00:02:37.610> nice<00:02:37.820> and

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
just make sure everything's nice and

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.210 
just make sure everything's nice and
balanced<00:02:38.780> up<00:02:38.930> ready<00:02:39.200> for<00:02:39.410> that<00:02:39.560> time<00:02:39.800> of<00:02:40.160> year

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
balanced up ready for that time of year

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:58.570 
balanced up ready for that time of year
when<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:40.790> Weber<00:02:40.970> really<00:02:41.330> turns<00:02:41.570> on<00:02:41.750> us<00:02:57.580> so

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
when the Weber really turns on us so

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.070 
when the Weber really turns on us so
what<00:02:58.700> we've<00:02:58.820> done<00:02:58.850> now<00:02:58.970> is<00:02:59.150> we<00:02:59.390> began<00:02:59.660> to<00:02:59.840> cut

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
what we've done now is we began to cut

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.080 
what we've done now is we began to cut
back<00:03:00.290> some<00:03:01.040> of<00:03:01.070> the<00:03:01.160> braking<00:03:01.550> bumps<00:03:01.700> we're<00:03:02.000> not

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
back some of the braking bumps we're not

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.430 
back some of the braking bumps we're not
taking<00:03:02.420> them<00:03:02.480> out<00:03:02.630> completely<00:03:02.810> we're<00:03:03.320> going

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
taking them out completely we're going

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.260 
taking them out completely we're going
to<00:03:03.500> leave<00:03:03.680> it<00:03:03.860> so<00:03:04.040> slightly<00:03:04.460> stepped<00:03:04.910> coming

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
to leave it so slightly stepped coming

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:06.850 
to leave it so slightly stepped coming
through<00:03:05.480> and<00:03:05.960> we're<00:03:06.080> now<00:03:06.230> down<00:03:06.410> into<00:03:06.770> the

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
through and we're now down into the

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.480 
through and we're now down into the
corner<00:03:07.040> here<00:03:07.250> so<00:03:07.640> we've<00:03:07.790> got<00:03:07.940> this<00:03:08.060> part<00:03:08.360> of

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
corner here so we've got this part of

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.160 
corner here so we've got this part of
stuff<00:03:10.490> that<00:03:10.670> we've<00:03:10.820> just<00:03:11.030> raked<00:03:11.240> together<00:03:11.630> but

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
stuff that we've just raked together but

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.450 
stuff that we've just raked together but
what<00:03:12.290> we're<00:03:12.380> going<00:03:12.470> to<00:03:12.560> do<00:03:12.650> now<00:03:12.860> is<00:03:12.890> hit<00:03:13.250> its

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
what we're going to do now is hit its

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.790 
what we're going to do now is hit its
lumpy<00:03:13.910> quite<00:03:14.720> hard<00:03:14.960> just<00:03:15.260> to<00:03:15.350> get<00:03:15.470> this<00:03:15.620> out

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
lumpy quite hard just to get this out

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.440 
lumpy quite hard just to get this out
and<00:03:16.010> just<00:03:16.160> so<00:03:16.310> that<00:03:16.490> we<00:03:16.580> can<00:03:16.730> actually<00:03:16.850> open<00:03:17.180> up

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
and just so that we can actually open up

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.180 
and just so that we can actually open up
this<00:03:17.630> corner<00:03:17.990> again<00:03:18.230> a<00:03:18.260> little<00:03:18.440> bit<00:03:18.560> at<00:03:19.040> the

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
this corner again a little bit at the

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.070 
this corner again a little bit at the
moment<00:03:19.610> the<00:03:19.760> top<00:03:20.000> riders<00:03:20.390> won't<00:03:20.600> notice<00:03:20.930> this

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
moment the top riders won't notice this

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.810 
moment the top riders won't notice this
but<00:03:21.350> the<00:03:21.440> lesser<00:03:21.650> riders<00:03:22.130> we<00:03:22.280> coming<00:03:22.550> in<00:03:22.670> and

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
but the lesser riders we coming in and

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.220 
but the lesser riders we coming in and
getting<00:03:22.880> bullied<00:03:23.210> by<00:03:23.450> this<00:03:23.660> hump<00:03:23.900> a<00:03:24.020> little

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
getting bullied by this hump a little

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.840 
getting bullied by this hump a little
bit<00:03:24.380> and<00:03:24.830> we'll<00:03:24.980> be<00:03:25.100> able<00:03:25.220> to<00:03:25.370> just<00:03:25.430> open<00:03:25.820> that

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
bit and we'll be able to just open that

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.520 
bit and we'll be able to just open that
up<00:03:26.060> and<00:03:26.210> just<00:03:26.390> give<00:03:26.540> them<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:26.930> option<00:03:27.110> of<00:03:27.380> just

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
up and just give them the option of just

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.860 
up and just give them the option of just
running<00:03:27.770> this<00:03:28.010> turn<00:03:28.310> a<00:03:28.340> little<00:03:28.550> bit<00:03:28.760> wider<00:03:28.970> as

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
running this turn a little bit wider as

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.360 
running this turn a little bit wider as
i<00:03:30.020> said<00:03:30.080> earlier<00:03:30.200> what<00:03:30.590> it<00:03:30.650> will<00:03:30.740> also<00:03:31.040> do<00:03:31.190> is

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
i said earlier what it will also do is

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.830 
i said earlier what it will also do is
it<00:03:31.520> will<00:03:31.610> just<00:03:31.820> capture<00:03:32.480> some<00:03:32.660> of<00:03:32.780> the

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
it will just capture some of the

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.180 
it will just capture some of the
sediment<00:03:33.050> that's<00:03:33.320> beginning<00:03:33.740> to<00:03:33.770> break<00:03:33.980> away

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
sediment that's beginning to break away

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.220 
sediment that's beginning to break away
from<00:03:34.340> the<00:03:34.550> edge<00:03:34.730> of<00:03:34.850> here<00:03:35.060> and<00:03:35.540> just<00:03:35.780> open<00:03:36.110> this

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
from the edge of here and just open this

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.930 
from the edge of here and just open this
back<00:03:36.470> up<00:03:36.500> and<00:03:36.860> just<00:03:37.220> give<00:03:37.370> you<00:03:37.460> a<00:03:37.520> little<00:03:37.730> bit

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
back up and just give you a little bit

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.400 
back up and just give you a little bit
more<00:03:38.060> time<00:03:38.300> on<00:03:38.450> entry<00:03:38.810> just<00:03:39.020> to<00:03:39.110> set<00:03:39.320> yourself

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
more time on entry just to set yourself

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.500 
more time on entry just to set yourself
up<00:03:39.770> for<00:03:39.830> the<00:03:40.070> corner<00:03:40.460> that's<00:03:41.090> really<00:03:41.330> what

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
up for the corner that's really what

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.180 
up for the corner that's really what
we're<00:03:41.600> looking<00:03:41.900> to<00:03:41.930> do<00:03:42.170> along<00:03:42.800> with<00:03:42.830> as<00:03:43.070> i

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
we're looking to do along with as i

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.590 
we're looking to do along with as i
mentioned<00:03:43.550> earlier<00:03:43.670> the<00:03:44.000> water<00:03:44.180> management

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
mentioned earlier the water management

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.270 
mentioned earlier the water management
we<00:03:44.900> don't<00:03:45.050> want<00:03:45.200> too<00:03:45.380> much<00:03:45.560> water<00:03:45.830> running

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
we don't want too much water running

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.040 
we don't want too much water running
down<00:03:46.460> and<00:03:46.970> getting<00:03:47.150> stuck<00:03:47.480> in<00:03:47.630> these<00:03:47.750> holes

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
down and getting stuck in these holes

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.080 
down and getting stuck in these holes
that<00:03:48.770> can<00:03:48.950> really<00:03:49.220> cause<00:03:49.430> some<00:03:49.640> trouble<00:03:49.850> over

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
that can really cause some trouble over

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.850 
that can really cause some trouble over
the<00:03:50.330> winter<00:03:50.660> and<00:03:50.840> we're<00:03:51.230> trying<00:03:51.380> to<00:03:51.560> prep<00:03:51.770> the

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
the winter and we're trying to prep the

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.380 
the winter and we're trying to prep the
track<00:03:52.100> ready<00:03:52.310> for<00:03:52.520> that<00:03:52.670> so<00:03:52.970> we're<00:03:53.120> just<00:03:53.150> going

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
track ready for that so we're just going

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.090 
track ready for that so we're just going
to<00:03:53.420> hit<00:03:53.600> this<00:03:53.720> one<00:03:53.930> will<00:03:54.560> come<00:03:54.740> back<00:03:54.890> in<00:03:54.920> a

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
to hit this one will come back in a

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.060 
to hit this one will come back in a
while<00:03:55.420> trusting<00:03:56.420> the<00:03:56.510> trustee<00:03:57.080> mattox<00:03:57.950> can

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
while trusting the trustee mattox can

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.980 
while trusting the trustee mattox can
have<00:03:58.190> a<00:03:58.250> go<00:03:58.370> at<00:03:58.400> this<00:03:58.580> one<00:03:58.820> and<00:03:59.000> we'll<00:03:59.840> give<00:03:59.960> it

00:03:59.980 --> 00:03:59.990 
have a go at this one and we'll give it

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:29.200 
have a go at this one and we'll give it
a<00:04:00.110> go

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.969 

okay<00:04:30.210> so<00:04:30.440> everything's<00:04:31.440> starting<00:04:31.650> to<00:04:31.770> come

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
okay so everything's starting to come

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:33.680 
okay so everything's starting to come
together<00:04:32.130> now<00:04:32.490> we've<00:04:32.910> cleared<00:04:33.180> out<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:33.479> track

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
together now we've cleared out the track

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.120 
together now we've cleared out the track
we've<00:04:33.900> taken<00:04:34.110> out<00:04:34.350> the<00:04:34.380> little<00:04:34.710> hump<00:04:34.860> there

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
we've taken out the little hump there

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.890 
we've taken out the little hump there
and<00:04:35.610> done<00:04:35.760> some<00:04:35.940> other<00:04:36.090> work<00:04:36.330> what<00:04:36.630> we<00:04:36.720> had

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
and done some other work what we had

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.540 
and done some other work what we had
here<00:04:37.139> was<00:04:37.290> a<00:04:37.350> little<00:04:37.650> gully<00:04:37.860> that<00:04:38.130> ran<00:04:38.310> down

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
here was a little gully that ran down

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.310 
here was a little gully that ran down
the<00:04:38.729> inside<00:04:39.060> of<00:04:39.120> the<00:04:39.300> corner<00:04:39.690> so<00:04:40.169> we've<00:04:40.289> just

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
the inside of the corner so we've just

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.350 
the inside of the corner so we've just
shut<00:04:40.740> that<00:04:41.100> off<00:04:41.160> so<00:04:41.550> any<00:04:41.699> water<00:04:41.940> running

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
shut that off so any water running

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.480 
shut that off so any water running
through<00:04:42.510> can<00:04:42.810> run<00:04:43.020> out<00:04:43.199> probably<00:04:44.100> still<00:04:44.310> run

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
through can run out probably still run

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.860 
through can run out probably still run
around<00:04:44.699> the<00:04:44.820> corner<00:04:44.850> a<00:04:45.150> little<00:04:45.240> bit<00:04:45.600> but<00:04:45.720> it's

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
around the corner a little bit but it's

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.480 
around the corner a little bit but it's
not<00:04:46.050> running<00:04:46.440> in<00:04:46.560> such<00:04:46.740> a<00:04:46.770> channel<00:04:47.220> and<00:04:47.340> that's

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
not running in such a channel and that's

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.189 
not running in such a channel and that's
the<00:04:47.639> key<00:04:47.820> thing<00:04:47.850> is<00:04:48.090> to<00:04:48.240> dissipate<00:04:48.780> that<00:04:48.960> water

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 
the key thing is to dissipate that water

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:51.170 
the key thing is to dissipate that water
energy<00:04:49.470> makes<00:04:50.250> the<00:04:50.430> trail<00:04:50.639> where<00:04:50.880> a<00:04:50.910> lot

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
energy makes the trail where a lot

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.790 
energy makes the trail where a lot
better<00:04:51.389> what<00:04:51.990> we've<00:04:52.110> also<00:04:52.289> done<00:04:52.560> is<00:04:52.770> just

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
better what we've also done is just

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.830 
better what we've also done is just
raped<00:04:53.160> through<00:04:53.460> as<00:04:53.910> I<00:04:54.210> said<00:04:54.270> earlier<00:04:54.449> we're

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
raped through as I said earlier we're

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.120 
raped through as I said earlier we're
going<00:04:54.870> to<00:04:54.990> keep<00:04:55.229> some<00:04:55.470> of<00:04:55.590> these<00:04:55.650> braking

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
going to keep some of these braking

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.590 
going to keep some of these braking
bumps<00:04:56.280> but<00:04:56.580> we're<00:04:56.699> just<00:04:56.729> churning<00:04:57.180> out<00:04:57.419> the

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
bumps but we're just churning out the

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.450 
bumps but we're just churning out the
frequency<00:04:57.900> so<00:04:58.350> rather<00:04:58.530> than<00:04:58.800> being<00:04:59.010> stuck<00:04:59.280> a

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
frequency so rather than being stuck a

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.340 
frequency so rather than being stuck a
bumps<00:04:59.850> into<00:05:00.030> here<00:05:00.360> they're<00:05:00.900> now<00:05:01.080> little

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
bumps into here they're now little

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.379 
bumps into here they're now little
shelves<00:05:01.620> as<00:05:01.889> you<00:05:02.010> come<00:05:02.220> down<00:05:02.250> you<00:05:02.850> can<00:05:03.030> open<00:05:03.060> up

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:03.389 
shelves as you come down you can open up

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:04.850 
shelves as you come down you can open up
this<00:05:03.539> turn<00:05:03.810> if<00:05:03.990> you<00:05:04.080> want<00:05:04.260> to<00:05:04.350> or<00:05:04.410> you<00:05:04.500> can<00:05:04.680> run

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
this turn if you want to or you can run

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.529 
this turn if you want to or you can run
the<00:05:04.949> inside<00:05:05.340> and<00:05:05.940> then<00:05:06.030> you've<00:05:06.150> got<00:05:06.180> this<00:05:06.360> nice

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:06.539 
the inside and then you've got this nice

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:08.090 
the inside and then you've got this nice
platform<00:05:06.930> here<00:05:07.350> at<00:05:07.440> the<00:05:07.530> bottom<00:05:07.770> to<00:05:07.889> catch<00:05:08.070> e

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
platform here at the bottom to catch e

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.770 
platform here at the bottom to catch e
all<00:05:08.820> of<00:05:09.090> that<00:05:09.210> with<00:05:09.360> all<00:05:09.479> the<00:05:09.510> sediment
