zhuzi asking passion about doing things
that<00:00:11.070> were<00:00:11.190> venturous<00:00:11.700> getting<00:00:12.090> out<00:00:12.179> and

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
that were venturous getting out and

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.820 
that were venturous getting out and
exploring<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.780> planet<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.320> whether<00:00:13.590> it<00:00:13.710> was

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
exploring the planet and whether it was

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.939 
exploring the planet and whether it was
motorcycles<00:00:14.670> or<00:00:14.880> boats<00:00:15.179> or<00:00:15.570> airplanes<00:00:16.170> flying

motorcycles or boats or airplanes flying

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.620 
motorcycles or boats or airplanes flying
was<00:00:17.220> something<00:00:17.490> that<00:00:17.520> was<00:00:18.029> very<00:00:18.060> really<00:00:18.480> AIDS

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
was something that was very really AIDS

today<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.780> really<00:00:34.590> about<00:00:34.710> moving<00:00:35.100> your<00:00:35.190> body

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
get in a matter of a couple weeks so it

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.749 
get in a matter of a couple weeks so it
was<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.869> moment<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.320> realized<00:01:16.829> what<00:01:17.280> aviation

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
was a moment I realized what aviation

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.420 
was a moment I realized what aviation
could<00:01:17.970> be<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.360> as<00:01:18.869> an<00:01:18.990> academic<00:01:19.590> exercise<00:01:19.710> I'm

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
could be and as an academic exercise I'm

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.280 
could be and as an academic exercise I'm
just<00:01:20.549> going<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.700> study<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.090> in<00:01:21.240> each<00:01:21.659> class<00:01:22.020> I

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
just going to study it in each class I

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.840 
just going to study it in each class I
would<00:01:22.439> spend<00:01:22.770> them<00:01:22.979> towards<00:01:23.520> something

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
would spend them towards something

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.880 
would spend them towards something
related<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:24.240> project<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.380> first<00:01:25.680> one

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
related this project so the first one

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.529 
related this project so the first one
was<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.100> market<00:01:26.460> analysis<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:28.429> AHA<00:01:29.429> was<00:01:29.819> whoa

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:30.539 
was a market analysis and AHA was whoa

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:32.749 
was a market analysis and AHA was whoa
that<00:01:31.140> there's<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.770> big<00:01:31.950> market<00:01:32.069> here<00:01:32.369> bigger

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
that there's a big market here bigger

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.419 
that there's a big market here bigger
than<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:32.969> expected<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.960> other<00:01:33.990> aha<00:01:34.409> moment<00:01:34.829> was

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:35.429 
than I expected the other aha moment was

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:37.669 
than I expected the other aha moment was
if<00:01:35.819> a<00:01:35.939> start-up<00:01:36.179> does<00:01:36.539> not<00:01:36.749> do<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.380> likely

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679 
if a start-up does not do this it likely

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:39.830 
if a start-up does not do this it likely
will<00:01:38.009> not<00:01:38.189> materialize<00:01:38.399> I<00:01:39.119> had<00:01:39.569> a<00:01:39.600> business

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
will not materialize I had a business

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.859 
will not materialize I had a business
plan<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.499> had<00:01:40.619> thrown<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.460> switch<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.819> on

more recreation

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.960

now<00:03:43.799> you<00:03:43.860> think<00:03:44.069> a<00:03:44.099> camping<00:03:44.610> fishing

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
now you think a camping fishing

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.820 
now you think a camping fishing
exploring<00:03:45.750> whatever<00:03:45.989> you<00:03:46.049> and<00:03:46.260> so<00:03:46.650> it

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
exploring whatever you and so it

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.259 
exploring whatever you and so it
companies<00:03:47.189> more<00:03:47.400> than<00:03:47.549> an<00:03:47.610> airplane<00:03:47.970> it's

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
companies more than an airplane it's

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.670 
companies more than an airplane it's
about<00:03:48.540> really<00:03:48.840> honoring<00:03:49.379> the<00:03:49.439> human

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
about really honoring the human

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.259 
about really honoring the human
experience<00:03:50.040> and<00:03:50.310> delivering<00:03:50.700> something<00:03:50.970> that

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
when you finally go out and fly you find

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.699 
when you finally go out and fly you find

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
that you can fly it's safe you can learn
