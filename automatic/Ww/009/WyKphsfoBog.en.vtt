padded<00:02:57.390> nicely<00:02:58.049> and<00:02:58.260> you<00:02:58.560> can<00:02:58.739> lace<00:02:58.950> them<00:02:59.130> up

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250

like<00:03:03.630> that<00:03:03.690> I<00:03:04.140> was<00:03:04.620> a<00:03:04.650> little<00:03:05.069> worried<00:03:05.430> about

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
like that I was a little worried about

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.660 
like that I was a little worried about
these<00:03:05.849> being<00:03:06.209> too<00:03:06.569> high<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:07.200> restrictive<00:03:08.160> but

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
these being too high and restrictive but

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.610 
these being too high and restrictive but
that<00:03:08.819> isn't<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.269> case<00:03:09.450> even<00:03:10.319> though<00:03:10.440> they're

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
that isn't the case even though they're

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.800 
that isn't the case even though they're
high<00:03:10.769> tops<00:03:11.130> they<00:03:11.430> aren't<00:03:11.819> clunky<00:03:12.209> and<00:03:12.390> with

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
high tops they aren't clunky and with

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.380 
high tops they aren't clunky and with
the<00:03:12.930> dynamic<00:03:13.590> proprioceptive<00:03:14.459> collar<00:03:14.880> they

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
the dynamic proprioceptive collar they

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.090 
the dynamic proprioceptive collar they
actually<00:03:15.900> mold<00:03:16.230> to<00:03:16.500> your<00:03:16.530> leg

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
actually mold to your leg

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.280 
actually mold to your leg
so<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.549> sneaker<00:03:17.880> just<00:03:18.209> becomes<00:03:18.569> an<00:03:18.870> extension

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
so the sneaker just becomes an extension

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.680 
so the sneaker just becomes an extension
of<00:03:19.620> you<00:03:19.829> which<00:03:20.160> is<00:03:20.190> really<00:03:20.340> dope<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:21.209> support

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
of you which is really dope the support

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.379 
of you which is really dope the support
is<00:03:21.930> very<00:03:22.200> good<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:23.040> upper<00:03:23.430> is<00:03:23.609> one<00:03:23.910> piece<00:03:24.180> of

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
is very good the upper is one piece of

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.599 
is very good the upper is one piece of
flying<00:03:24.630> it<00:03:24.900> but<00:03:25.290> it's<00:03:25.410> much<00:03:25.680> stronger<00:03:26.040> fibers

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
flying it but it's much stronger fibers

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:28.490 
flying it but it's much stronger fibers
than<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.180> flying<00:03:27.480> that<00:03:27.660> you<00:03:27.780> see<00:03:27.989> on<00:03:28.109> runners

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
than the flying that you see on runners

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.379 
than the flying that you see on runners
they<00:03:29.069> even<00:03:29.459> have<00:03:29.609> different<00:03:30.030> types<00:03:30.209> of

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
they even have different types of

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:32.300 
they even have different types of
stitching<00:03:30.900> throughout<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.470> sneaker<00:03:31.889> to

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
stitching throughout the sneaker to

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.910 
stitching throughout the sneaker to
allow<00:03:32.609> for<00:03:32.940> different<00:03:33.329> movements<00:03:33.840> now<00:03:34.440> let<00:03:34.769> me

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
allow for different movements now let me

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.680 
allow for different movements now let me
also<00:03:35.100> say<00:03:35.519> that<00:03:35.549> just<00:03:36.000> because<00:03:36.299> this<00:03:36.510> is<00:03:36.660> a

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
also say that just because this is a

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.750 
also say that just because this is a
high-top<00:03:37.230> it<00:03:37.500> isn't<00:03:38.130> going<00:03:38.220> to<00:03:38.310> prevent<00:03:38.579> you

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
high-top it isn't going to prevent you

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.670 
high-top it isn't going to prevent you
from<00:03:38.790> rolling<00:03:39.299> your<00:03:39.420> ankle<00:03:39.450> that<00:03:39.900> collar<00:03:40.350> is

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
from rolling your ankle that collar is

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.039 
from rolling your ankle that collar is
not<00:03:41.040> an<00:03:41.250> ankle<00:03:41.579> brace<00:03:41.760> if<00:03:42.030> you<00:03:42.239> wear<00:03:42.450> braces<00:03:42.930> or

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
not an ankle brace if you wear braces or

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.199 
not an ankle brace if you wear braces or
tape<00:03:43.260> up<00:03:43.470> you<00:03:43.620> should<00:03:43.829> still<00:03:44.130> do<00:03:44.280> that<00:03:44.489> so<00:03:44.940> just

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
tape up you should still do that so just

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.009 
tape up you should still do that so just
keep<00:03:45.359> that<00:03:45.510> in<00:03:45.660> mind

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
keep that in mind

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.410 
keep that in mind
lockdown<00:03:46.650> is<00:03:46.889> pretty<00:03:47.130> good<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.850> carbon-fiber

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
lockdown is pretty good the carbon-fiber
