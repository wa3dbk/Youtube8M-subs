season<00:01:12.570> in<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.140> limit<00:01:13.520> so<00:01:14.520> how<00:01:14.909> are<00:01:14.970> we<00:01:15.119> going<00:01:15.299> to

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
season in a limit so how are we going to

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.649 
season in a limit so how are we going to
solve<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:15.990> invasive<00:01:16.380> problem<00:01:17.420> think<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.570> the

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
solve this invasive problem think of the

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.460 
solve this invasive problem think of the
bullfrogs<00:01:19.170> like<00:01:20.360> cockroaches<00:01:21.360> or<00:01:21.630> invasive

bullfrogs like cockroaches or invasive
grubs<00:01:23.159> Japanese<00:01:23.939> beetles<00:01:25.040> therefore<00:01:26.270> we<00:01:27.270> need

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
grubs Japanese beetles therefore we need

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.870 
grubs Japanese beetles therefore we need
to<00:01:27.509> decrease<00:01:27.840> their<00:01:28.650> numbers<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.159> increase

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
to decrease their numbers and increase

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.910 
to decrease their numbers and increase
the<00:01:30.060> numbers<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.689> frogs<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.229> should<00:01:31.470> be<00:01:31.619> here

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
the numbers of frogs that should be here

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.520 
the numbers of frogs that should be here
think<00:01:32.790> about<00:01:33.090> getting<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.689> fishing<00:01:34.049> license

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
think about getting a fishing license

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.649 
think about getting a fishing license
getting<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.520> outdoors<00:01:36.000> doing<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.509> right

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
getting the outdoors doing the right

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.990 
getting the outdoors doing the right
time<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:37.049> year<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.560> utilizing<00:01:38.549> these<00:01:38.640> frogs

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
time of year and utilizing these frogs

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.340 
time of year and utilizing these frogs
as<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.780> food<00:01:40.229> source<00:01:40.530> their<00:01:41.250> legs<00:01:41.930> make<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:42.960> great

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
as a food source their legs make a great

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.700 
as a food source their legs make a great
meal<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.420> when<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.540> can<00:01:45.689> use<00:01:45.899> these<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.470> cook

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
meal and when you can use these to cook

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.380 
meal and when you can use these to cook
them<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.070> barbecue<00:01:47.579> them<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.850> they'll<00:01:48.270> be<00:01:48.299> a

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
them and barbecue them and they'll be a

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.359 
them and barbecue them and they'll be a
great<00:01:48.570> way<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.899> decrease<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:49.829> invasive

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
great way to decrease this invasive

species if you're not into eating frog
legs<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.390> decrease<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.960> numbers<00:01:55.320> another<00:01:55.950> way

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
legs to decrease the numbers another way

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.830 
legs to decrease the numbers another way
you<00:01:56.159> could<00:01:56.340> decrease<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.939> numbers<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.600> help

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
you could decrease the numbers and help

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.139 
you could decrease the numbers and help

ponds or even backyard ponds is not have
fish<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:04.530> bullfrog<00:02:05.040> is<00:02:05.369> only<00:02:05.729> frog<00:02:06.149> in

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
fish the bullfrog is only frog in

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.719 
fish the bullfrog is only frog in
Nebraska<00:02:06.990> in<00:02:07.140> which<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.770> tadpoles<00:02:08.340> are<00:02:08.550> just

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
Nebraska in which the tadpoles are just

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.070 
Nebraska in which the tadpoles are just
tasteful<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.330> fish<00:02:09.599> our<00:02:09.959> other<00:02:10.739> native<00:02:11.580> frogs

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
tasteful to fish our other native frogs

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.940 
tasteful to fish our other native frogs
tadpoles<00:02:13.080> get<00:02:13.260> eaten<00:02:13.500> by<00:02:13.620> fish

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
tadpoles get eaten by fish

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.680 
tadpoles get eaten by fish
so<00:02:14.160> if<00:02:14.250> we<00:02:14.340> decrease<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.819> number<00:02:15.209> of<00:02:15.240> fish<00:02:15.510> in

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
so if we decrease the number of fish in

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.620 
so if we decrease the number of fish in
the<00:02:15.780> ponds<00:02:16.230> increase<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.730> number<00:02:18.060> of<00:02:18.180> native

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
the ponds increase the number of native

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.979 
the ponds increase the number of native
frogs<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.410> toads<00:02:20.060> we<00:02:21.060> won't<00:02:21.270> have<00:02:21.420> problems

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
frogs and toads we won't have problems

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.470 
frogs and toads we won't have problems
with<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.560> bullfrog<00:02:23.069> and<00:02:23.310> it<00:02:23.819> won't<00:02:24.000> be<00:02:24.120> taking

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
with the bullfrog and it won't be taking
