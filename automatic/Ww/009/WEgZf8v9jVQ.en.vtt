to<00:01:16.500> be<00:01:16.590> studying<00:01:16.830> their<00:01:17.220> behavior<00:01:17.759> like<00:01:18.180> each

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
to be studying their behavior like each

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.390 
to be studying their behavior like each
turtle<00:01:18.960> let's<00:01:19.590> see<00:01:19.770> how<00:01:19.950> they<00:01:20.189> hatch

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
turtle let's see how they hatch

differently and like their yolk sacs
like<00:01:23.520> what<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.759> differences<00:01:24.240> are<00:01:24.390> like<00:01:24.869> you

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
like what the differences are like you

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.080 
like what the differences are like you
know<00:01:25.140> get<00:01:25.320> extra<00:01:25.619> credit<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:25.979> school<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.460> you

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090

I see kind of lines across the edges of
the<00:02:57.600> egg<00:02:58.070> kind<00:02:59.070> of<00:02:59.160> like<00:03:00.170> looks<00:03:01.170> musically

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710

hobo<00:03:03.260> alright<00:03:04.730> windows<00:03:05.730> on<00:03:06.030> both<00:03:06.060> sides<00:03:06.540> of

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
hobo alright windows on both sides of

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.330 
hobo alright windows on both sides of
the<00:03:07.230> egg<00:03:07.440> when<00:03:07.710> you<00:03:07.800> shine<00:03:08.010> a<00:03:08.040> light<00:03:08.280> through

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
the egg when you shine a light through

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.370 
the egg when you shine a light through
it<00:03:08.610> you<00:03:08.760> can<00:03:08.820> kind<00:03:09.180> of<00:03:09.240> see<00:03:09.450> through<00:03:10.490> but<00:03:11.490> I

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
it you can kind of see through but I

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.800 
it you can kind of see through but I
don't<00:03:13.380> really<00:03:13.760> know<00:03:14.760> what<00:03:14.970> that<00:03:15.000> is

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
don't really know what that is

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.010 
don't really know what that is
I<00:03:16.550> can't<00:03:17.550> wait<00:03:17.700> to<00:03:17.880> see<00:03:18.060> what<00:03:18.210> comes<00:03:18.420> out<00:03:18.660> but

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
I can't wait to see what comes out but

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.660 
I can't wait to see what comes out but
I'm<00:03:19.110> pretty<00:03:19.290> doubtful<00:03:19.860> that<00:03:20.100> anything<00:03:20.550> will

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
I'm pretty doubtful that anything will

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:27.350 
I'm pretty doubtful that anything will
come<00:03:20.700> out<00:03:21.030> because<00:03:25.010> because<00:03:26.010> it<00:03:26.190> was<00:03:26.430> outside

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
come out because because it was outside

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.290 
come out because because it was outside
of<00:03:27.570> an<00:03:27.660> incubator<00:03:27.990> for<00:03:28.290> a<00:03:28.530> day<00:03:28.770> and<00:03:28.830> a<00:03:28.980> half<00:03:29.300> my

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
of an incubator for a day and a half my

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.650 
of an incubator for a day and a half my
aunt<00:03:30.540> found<00:03:30.870> it<00:03:31.140> in<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:31.410> sand<00:03:31.740> and<00:03:32.250> I<00:03:33.000> guess

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
aunt found it in the sand and I guess

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.870 
aunt found it in the sand and I guess
since<00:03:34.110> it<00:03:34.500> was<00:03:34.650> pretty<00:03:34.860> sunny<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.370> past<00:03:35.580> few

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
since it was pretty sunny the past few

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.870 
since it was pretty sunny the past few
days<00:03:36.080> that<00:03:37.080> the<00:03:37.470> Sun<00:03:37.770> had<00:03:38.130> kept<00:03:38.460> the<00:03:38.610> sand

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
days that the Sun had kept the sand

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.610 
days that the Sun had kept the sand
really<00:03:39.060> hot<00:03:39.420> which<00:03:39.720> probably<00:03:40.170> kept<00:03:40.350> the<00:03:40.440> egg

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
really hot which probably kept the egg

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.890 
really hot which probably kept the egg
really<00:03:40.950> warm<00:03:41.190> which<00:03:41.430> is<00:03:41.580> really<00:03:41.940> good<00:03:42.150> but

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
really warm which is really good but

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.650 
really warm which is really good but
then<00:03:43.190> when<00:03:44.190> my<00:03:44.310> aunt<00:03:44.520> found<00:03:44.850> it<00:03:45.060> she<00:03:45.270> just<00:03:45.450> put

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
then when my aunt found it she just put

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.920 
then when my aunt found it she just put
it<00:03:45.780> in<00:03:45.870> a<00:03:45.960> little<00:03:46.230> blanket<00:03:47.360> so<00:03:48.360> I<00:03:48.420> think<00:03:48.540> that

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
it in a little blanket so I think that

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.690 
it in a little blanket so I think that
was<00:03:49.200> probably<00:03:49.440> a<00:03:49.620> little<00:03:49.770> too<00:03:49.890> cold<00:03:50.370> for<00:03:50.520> that

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
was probably a little too cold for that

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.620 
was probably a little too cold for that
it<00:03:51.180> might<00:03:51.390> have<00:03:51.630> died<00:03:51.960> or<00:03:52.230> something<00:03:53.600> but<00:03:54.600> I

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
it might have died or something but I

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.240 
it might have died or something but I
don't<00:03:54.900> know<00:03:55.020> I<00:03:55.050> might<00:03:55.290> not<00:03:55.440> even<00:03:55.560> be<00:03:55.800> a<00:03:55.830> fertile

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
don't know I might not even be a fertile

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.270 
don't know I might not even be a fertile
