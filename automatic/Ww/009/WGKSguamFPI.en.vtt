00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.189
 well we end up here outside the 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:12.210
 tuna 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.130
 to try fishing for brown trout 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.900
 he does not arrive from the river 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.800
 the essential thing for fishing the 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.990
 trout 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.689
 it really is not to camouflage 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.609
 too close the resort river uses 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.890
 canes long enough and she is 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.950
 adjustable at all these guns the sale to 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.800
 this weight unfolds or this refusal 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.860
 the function of all a lot of branches 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.050
 or not if the area and vegas place is 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.210
 pretty clear game really enlarge my 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.610
 cane to the maximum and approach 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.040
 delicately even in powerful maths of 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.530
 from time to time to fish for a 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:49.309
 area where the interesting jails are going 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:52.809
 really be woody areas the wood 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:55.180
 dead the areas of a back current 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:59.390
 here or so men the current 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.710
 with just a good one can be quieter 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.339
 you start by presenting yourself the 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.840
 hull fishing so just for you 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.610
 specify anyway the son whose 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.210
 use thread for its purpose look for the 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.790
 wild trout 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.200
 so you have never fished too much so 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.250
 that's his goals 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.800
 15 15 hundredths of a millimeter in fact 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.960
 a tip of a meter fifty 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.060
 close in son called fluoro 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.070
 carbon for cr son who has the 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.479
 peculiarity of being invisible under 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:33.440
 the water I had to make another agreement up 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:36.520
 start by connecting the two strands 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.100
 it's simple 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.990
 then 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.990
 learn the thread and cross them 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:51.600
 I turn my two sons together not to 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:53.150
 four times in 25 times 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.180
 7 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:59.590
 I will spend two pieces 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.590
 jean labor what I learned 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.479
 so an essential thing before 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:11.090
 squeeze her do not always know how to moisten her 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.390
 so we have plenty of time to wear 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.390
 saliva 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.770
 the time gently 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.420
 and that's giving us another agreement 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.580
 just cut 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.170
 the excess coat in the queue pieces 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.580
 let them in nature is ESTAC 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.380
 in a pocket and in his bag 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.020
 now we will go to the hook 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.850
 it's a number four hook then 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.100
 I rather use absentees to 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.500
 these groups no sense of trout avoids 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.550
 de laval is too deep so it's a 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.690
 pallet hook and a special e 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:54.770
 start by making a small loop 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.270
 we're going to finish like this on the hook and 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.350
 now we're going to twist the wire around 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:02.510
 the hook behind the pallet there and 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:07.240
 we will pass this son in the small 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.240
 loop that here 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.360
 just enough 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.400
 stretch it 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.030
 quietly our son 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.030
 the knot is tightening 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.320
 an essential thing is to spend the 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.080
 wire in front of the pallet towards the tip of 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.460
 the hook never behind otherwise 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.270
 the absence is not going well you leave north 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:32.850
 the lead has to be defined in 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.400
 function of the watercourse so the 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.660
 speed of current and depth 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:41.180
 so we still have a lot of lessons 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.180
 had two but high enough 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.040
 little used 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:52.250
 number 5 of the water and we're still going 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.540
 time put a smaller one near the green 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.000
 so that they roll a little more one 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.110
 chooses a green looks ok sees well 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.270
 put it on your head 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.970
 so these are black-headed greens 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.650
 it's simple enough sailing we headed 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.660
 really sees the hook passed by the 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.100
 head and we will drag it on 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.290
 the hook is important in fact of good 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.950
 hide the hook because the trout 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.950
 a very good view
