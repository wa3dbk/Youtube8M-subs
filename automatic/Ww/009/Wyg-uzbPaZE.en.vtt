00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.039 
leveling off when everyone's gone but
the<00:01:08.790> interesting<00:01:09.000> thing<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.780> some<00:01:09.960> of

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
the interesting thing is is that some of

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.450 
the interesting thing is is that some of
these<00:01:10.110> buildings<00:01:10.320> are<00:01:10.619> still<00:01:10.650> operating<00:01:11.189> it
