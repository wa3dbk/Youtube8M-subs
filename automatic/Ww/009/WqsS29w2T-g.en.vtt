00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.580
 You who like handicrafts, my name is 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.519
 10 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:17.879
 to bring one more idea to you 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:17.879
 painting on canopy cloth 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.439
 to record this craft work 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:32.290
 which is called fabric painting with 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.750
 pens okay I'll need 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.010
 special paint canisters for 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.129
 fabric 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.559
 these are bacar the art they are 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:46.690
 that they have two points one 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:49.360
 thin and one thick and they are made 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.470
 manufactured with fabric paint that does not 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.500
 leaves 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:57.070
 After drying it does not come out in the wash. 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:01.000
 We will also need material 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:04.629
 may be a cotton swab or may be 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.630
 hard bristle brushes 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.420
 These are in the course of work, I'll go 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.479
 show that they are only auxiliaries 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:17.079
 even they only serve to make a 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:19.990
 shaded because the work is done with 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:25.150
 I'll need the pens too. 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:27.670
 As material is alcohol gel can not be 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:32.560
 liquid alcohol looks have to be alcohol 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:34.689
 gel because this alcohol does not spread 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.780
 very easily when you fall into the 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:40.210
 fabric it is a little slower to 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.439
 then this will make it easier to 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.899
 our work 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:46.389
 if it were the net album would not give 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:48.999
 sure as it will expand by going 

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:52.630
 there is no way to mix it with the 

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:55.749
 you want several shades you enter something 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.270
 to lighten or to leave the ink a 

00:01:55.749 --> 00:02:02.740
 as much as transparent 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:06.759
 so let's start our work 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:09.690
 I chose here with Christmas theme, I 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:14.709
 I created this drawing that has a chicken 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:19.230
 All is already the character snows taken by natal 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:24.700
 with her chicks here and she is 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:27.580
 graced his nest for Christmas and for 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.370
 Finishing, I'll also wear this look. 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.200
 ink here that the paint puff which is a 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.170
 ink expands with heat 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.250
 work for the tree that is here 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:43.489
 back with the yellow pen and 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.720
 with the finest tip it looks like it has 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.489
 two tips 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:53.930
 I'm going to make the outline here of the star 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:57.819
 which is on the upper tip of the tree 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:01.220
 then fill with yellow and as is a 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:03.980
 small drawing I can already use 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.459
 here the same thin tip if it were a 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.920
 drawing would use the thicker and I will 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:13.819
 pick up is two shades of green has the 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:16.540
 green and light green 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:20.209
 so I 'll keep up the same 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:24.890
 with the thin point and I'll 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:29.150
 following here the risk doing here 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.319
 the needle-like foliage in our 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.349
 Pinheirinho 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:37.760
 so I 'm going to use green first 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:42.650
 darker, following the drawing of the 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:48.340
 since it was already printed here in the 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:53.959
 tissue and have been doing here all trace 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:04:01.519
 in Africa then first format with 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:04:06.410
 the dark green also some little piglets 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:11.799
 from top to bottom 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:18.410
 the traces and now with the light green 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:23.870
 Ok, I'll draw some thinner ones. 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:27.940
 so to paint the crate here 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.479
 I'll use three colors of pen 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.729
 Yellow 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:37.220
 the rust and crumpled start 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:42.490
 round the box with the brown and 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.490
 and the thin point and I'll expect to dry 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:54.760
 after I finished getting around the 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.370
 crate with the canetinha barrÃ³n 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.620
 I'll get the yellow one but not the side. 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:03.250
 of the son I use to circumvent the 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:05.140
 thick side and I'm going to do some 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.020
 stains here 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.340
 using thicker points of our 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:14.250
 little pen 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.250
 so I put some stains with yellow 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.810
 What's cool with the paint pen? 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:23.590
 because everyone risks because they already 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:27.520
 learned to use is since she was a child 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:30.310
 painting with crayons in crayon 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.620
 shall then use these 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.750
 is very similar to 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:39.460
 difference as it comes with ink 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:41.710
 fabric it adheres and fixes the 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.620
 I applied a little bit of yellow now 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:50.050
 I'm going to go in here and told rust and I'm going 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:55.420
 make some spots this background that the 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:58.150
 to give an effect even as 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:02.520
 being a wooden crate 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.520
 now is going to get the alcohol gel 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:11.680
 now with the aid can be a 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:15.610
 swab or brush 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:18.100
 I'll mix these colors here 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:21.430
 is using alcohol gel 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:24.610
 in the case of the swab 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:27.190
 it works also only that it has the 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:32.980
 disadvantage that the swab 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:35.890
 be made of cotton he soon spends 

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:41.020
 then who has the possibility of having a 

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:43.570
 thicker bristle brush can 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:47.320
 use the brush I'll show you how 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:52.600
 To do then I will humid here in the 

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:54.009
 alcohol gel and come looking and doing 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:58.119
 the miscegenation 

00:06:54.009 --> 00:07:03.789
 in colors action look I'm leaving you 

00:06:58.119 --> 00:07:08.289
 tone here merged by attaching one color to another 

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:10.569
 and I'm going to get that mark that stays 

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:11.559
 when we make a painting with 

00:07:10.569 --> 00:07:14.699
 little pen 

00:07:11.559 --> 00:07:18.430
 so I live here on alcohol gel and I go 

00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:21.069
 Applying for what? 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:24.339
 only that it will cause the drying of the 

00:07:21.069 --> 00:07:28.379
 a little pen that slows down a 

00:07:24.339 --> 00:07:32.999
 A little and I'm mixing colors 

00:07:28.379 --> 00:07:32.999
 he had this result
