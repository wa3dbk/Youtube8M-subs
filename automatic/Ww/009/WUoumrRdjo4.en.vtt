00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.440
 hello everyone today we are going to make a 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:15.880
 Tiramisu of strawberries and raspberries the 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.880
 ingredients are these that you see here 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.500
 We start by placing in a saucepan the 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.850
 chopped strawberries and raspberries 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.850
 and we add the sugar 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.550
 As you can see the fruit starts to 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.550
 drop a juice 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.670
 I recommend you to put us the little 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.800
 too high because it would spoil the 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.860
 fruit and let it cook for too long 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.860
 weather 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.230
 a clever mind we let it rest for 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.230
 that cool 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:04.320
 we mount the cream and we also separate it 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.900
 in a bowl 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.520
 we take the mascarpone and mix it with 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.920
 the sugar 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.219
 I recommend that the mascarpone be at 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.409
 room temperature because if it were 

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:19.070
 at refrigerator temperature it would be more 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.070
 difficult to move 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.110
 once it's all mixed together for a 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.110
 cream 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.350
 we mix it with enveloping movements 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.660
 little by little and gently 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.790
 and then mixed 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.600
 we already have all the ingredients for 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.600
 form beer 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.310
 we take the container that we are going to use 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.310
 in this case it is a glass 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:22.190
 we put sponge cake is the day the background 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.190
 chop them and you see that it does not fit 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.290
 we put the strawberry and the raspberry I do it 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.290
 in touching the cake well 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.849
 at the top of the strawberry 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.720
 I use a spoon but if you see that 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.830
 you find it easier with a sleeve 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.830
 pastry using it 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.790
 you just have to repeat the 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.290
 process 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.290
 and we put the soletilla sponge cake 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.920
 we add the fruit 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.620
 mascarpone 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.040
 you only have to decorate as 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.530
 with a couple of strawberries raspberries like 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.140
 You want to remember that before serving 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.940
 Theremin needs to rest about 8 hours 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.890
 in the fridge 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.420
 this is the result I hope there 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.100
 liked 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.520
