00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.069 

actually<00:03:43.969> all<00:03:44.180> of<00:03:44.209> them<00:03:44.480> have<00:03:44.689> a<00:03:44.719> little<00:03:44.930> bit

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:53.240 
actually all of them have a little bit
of<00:03:45.290> growth<00:03:45.560> on<00:03:45.829> it

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.900 

this<00:03:54.000> is<00:03:54.180> one<00:03:54.420> that<00:03:54.720> we<00:03:55.290> loved<00:03:55.670> some<00:03:56.670> of<00:03:56.790> the

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
this is one that we loved some of the

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.360 
this is one that we loved some of the
flower<00:03:57.360> buds<00:03:57.720> and<00:03:58.170> look<00:03:58.980> at<00:03:59.100> that<00:04:01.070> it<00:04:02.070> popped

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
flower buds and look at that it popped

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:12.440 
flower buds and look at that it popped
off<00:04:02.700> but<00:04:05.480> it's<00:04:06.480> amazing<00:04:07.850> so<00:04:08.850> on<00:04:11.240> the<00:04:12.240> new

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
off but it's amazing so on the new

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.370 
off but it's amazing so on the new
growth<00:04:12.810> it's<00:04:14.300> working

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:37.930 

this<00:04:19.380> one<00:04:19.620> here<00:04:24.380> nothing<00:04:25.380> yet<00:04:25.710> I<00:04:29.300> can<00:04:30.300> tell

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:46.090 

I<00:04:39.580> think<00:04:40.580> these<00:04:40.820> two<00:04:41.680> possibly<00:04:42.680> are<00:04:42.980> the<00:04:45.100> bush

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
I think these two possibly are the bush

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.490 
I think these two possibly are the bush
that<00:04:46.130> I<00:04:46.460> cut<00:04:46.880> off<00:04:47.060> in<00:04:47.480> the<00:04:47.510> front<00:04:47.750> yard<00:04:48.050> and<00:04:48.290> I

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
that I cut off in the front yard and I

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.460 
that I cut off in the front yard and I
don't<00:04:48.770> see<00:04:49.040> any<00:04:49.280> growth<00:04:51.790> but<00:04:52.790> though<00:04:53.470> no

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
don't see any growth but though no

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:05.870 
don't see any growth but though no
that's<00:04:54.830> not<00:04:55.280> one

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.960 

looks<00:05:06.880> like<00:05:07.120> progress<00:05:07.479> to<00:05:07.720> me
