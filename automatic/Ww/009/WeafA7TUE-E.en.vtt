just spent two days there just getting

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.440 
just spent two days there just getting
my<00:01:50.159> smithing<00:01:50.549> level<00:01:50.820> up

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
my smithing level up

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.529 
my smithing level up
50<00:01:52.289> crafting<00:01:52.979> level<00:01:53.189> 250<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:54.060> my<00:01:54.180> mining

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
50 crafting level 250 and my mining

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.469 
50 crafting level 250 and my mining
level<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.930> 52<00:01:55.500> as<00:01:55.530> well<00:01:55.979> i<00:01:56.219> also<00:01:56.490> got<00:01:56.700> 54<00:01:57.149> mining

level to 52 as well i also got 54 mining
so<00:01:57.600> i<00:01:57.630> thought<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:57.990> was<00:01:58.049> pretty<00:01:58.259> cool<00:01:58.590> i

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
so i thought that was pretty cool i

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.529 
so i thought that was pretty cool i
recorded<00:01:59.250> myself<00:01:59.369> getting<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.000> i<00:02:00.149> was<00:02:00.270> also

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
recorded myself getting it i was also

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:02.419 
recorded myself getting it i was also
pretty<00:02:00.780> close<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.259> 50<00:02:01.679> smithing<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:02.250> that's

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429 
pretty close to 50 smithing so that's

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:04.490 
pretty close to 50 smithing so that's
another<00:02:02.700> reason<00:02:02.939> why<00:02:03.119> i<00:02:03.270> decided<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.200> record

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
another reason why i decided to record

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.740 
another reason why i decided to record
