be<00:02:02.939> interested<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.810> pebble<00:02:04.110> does<00:02:04.320> have<00:02:04.500> an

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
be interested the pebble does have an

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.609 
be interested the pebble does have an
accelerometer<00:02:05.040> built-in<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.390> has

magnetometer so there's no reason why it

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.600 
magnetometer so there's no reason why it
can't<00:02:09.810> be<00:02:10.050> perfectly<00:02:10.649> capable<00:02:10.890> of<00:02:11.160> doing<00:02:11.340> that

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
battery life is one of the limitations

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.310 
battery life is one of the limitations
to<00:03:24.570> and<00:03:24.720> it's<00:03:24.810> a<00:03:24.870> problem<00:03:25.049> across

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
to and it's a problem across

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.280 
to and it's a problem across
smartwatches<00:03:25.950> 2<00:03:26.610> to<00:03:26.760> 7<00:03:27.120> days<00:03:27.330> I<00:03:27.660> found<00:03:28.140> it<00:03:28.230> was

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
smartwatches 2 to 7 days I found it was

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.199 
smartwatches 2 to 7 days I found it was
a<00:03:28.350> little<00:03:28.560> more<00:03:28.680> like<00:03:28.860> 2<00:03:29.160> it<00:03:29.430> does<00:03:29.820> come<00:03:30.030> with<00:03:30.060> a

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
a little more like 2 it does come with a

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.449 
a little more like 2 it does come with a
USB<00:03:30.510> charge<00:03:30.989> cable<00:03:31.049> that<00:03:31.920> magnetically

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
USB charge cable that magnetically

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.310 
USB charge cable that magnetically
connects<00:03:32.910> easily<00:03:33.390> just<00:03:33.690> be<00:03:33.810> careful<00:03:34.140> not<00:03:34.260> to

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
connects easily just be careful not to

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.080 
connects easily just be careful not to
lose<00:03:34.650> it<00:03:34.890> because<00:03:35.130> there<00:03:35.640> aren't<00:03:35.790> any<00:03:35.940> other

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
lose it because there aren't any other

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.259 
lose it because there aren't any other
cables<00:03:36.540> I<00:03:36.630> know<00:03:36.690> of<00:03:36.989> that<00:03:37.500> connect<00:03:37.830> like<00:03:38.010> that

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
cables I know of that connect like that

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.220 
cables I know of that connect like that
another<00:03:39.269> really<00:03:39.570> nice<00:03:39.690> thing<00:03:39.930> about<00:03:39.959> the

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
another really nice thing about the

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.910 
another really nice thing about the
pebble<00:03:40.590> it<00:03:40.739> is<00:03:41.040> 5<00:03:41.400> ATM<00:03:42.060> resistant<00:03:42.959> to<00:03:43.200> water<00:03:43.500> so

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
pebble it is 5 ATM resistant to water so

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.100 
pebble it is 5 ATM resistant to water so
they<00:03:44.880> suggest<00:03:45.299> you<00:03:45.390> can<00:03:45.510> swim<00:03:45.780> with<00:03:45.900> it<00:03:45.989> you

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
they suggest you can swim with it you

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.080 
they suggest you can swim with it you
can<00:03:46.230> take<00:03:46.320> a<00:03:46.380> shower<00:03:46.620> with<00:03:46.920> it<00:03:47.130> that's<00:03:47.820> up<00:03:47.970> to

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
can take a shower with it that's up to

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.580 
can take a shower with it that's up to
you<00:03:48.239> if<00:03:48.450> you're<00:03:48.570> feeling<00:03:48.870> that<00:03:48.900> bold<00:03:49.260> but<00:03:49.500> you

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
you if you're feeling that bold but you

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:50.750 
you if you're feeling that bold but you
certainly<00:03:49.769> could<00:03:50.070> wear<00:03:50.250> it<00:03:50.340> while<00:03:50.400> washing

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
certainly could wear it while washing

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.479 
certainly could wear it while washing
your<00:03:50.850> hands<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.600> pebble<00:03:51.870> SDK<00:03:52.530> should<00:03:53.130> provide

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
your hands the pebble SDK should provide

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.370 
your hands the pebble SDK should provide
a<00:03:53.549> lot<00:03:53.820> more<00:03:54.000> life<00:03:54.269> for<00:03:54.480> this<00:03:54.570> device<00:03:54.840> we're

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
a lot more life for this device we're

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.810 
a lot more life for this device we're
gonna<00:03:55.470> have<00:03:55.590> to<00:03:55.650> see<00:03:55.799> what<00:03:55.980> apps<00:03:56.130> come<00:03:56.400> out<00:03:56.549> for

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
gonna have to see what apps come out for

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:57.949 
gonna have to see what apps come out for
it<00:03:56.940> and<00:03:57.090> where<00:03:57.390> it's<00:03:57.510> going<00:03:57.630> to<00:03:57.690> hold<00:03:57.810> its

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
it and where it's going to hold its

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.530 
it and where it's going to hold its
place<00:03:58.260> and<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:58.590> SmartWatch<00:03:59.340> wars<00:03:59.700> whether

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
place and the SmartWatch wars whether

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.850 
place and the SmartWatch wars whether
it'll<00:04:00.750> be<00:04:00.900> something<00:04:01.140> that<00:04:01.290> people<00:04:01.680> will

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
it'll be something that people will

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.170 
it'll be something that people will
remember<00:04:02.100> or<00:04:02.400> whether<00:04:02.549> it's<00:04:02.730> gonna<00:04:02.820> be<00:04:02.970> a<00:04:03.000> blip

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
remember or whether it's gonna be a blip

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.740 
remember or whether it's gonna be a blip
