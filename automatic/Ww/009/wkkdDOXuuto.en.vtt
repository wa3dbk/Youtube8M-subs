very<00:00:10.230> quickly<00:00:10.469> what<00:00:10.710> we're<00:00:10.830> looking<00:00:11.040> at<00:00:11.160> here

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
very quickly what we're looking at here

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.339 
very quickly what we're looking at here
is<00:00:11.519> an<00:00:11.700> unsteady<00:00:12.090> solution<00:00:12.900> of<00:00:13.019> vortex

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
is an unsteady solution of vortex

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.169 
is an unsteady solution of vortex
shedding<00:00:13.559> off<00:00:13.860> of<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.099> cylinder<00:00:14.429> we<00:00:14.880> just<00:00:15.059> have

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
shedding off of a cylinder we just have

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.930 
shedding off of a cylinder we just have
a<00:00:15.210> simple<00:00:15.420> slice<00:00:15.809> here<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.760> let's<00:00:17.760> go<00:00:17.880> ahead

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
a simple slice here and let's go ahead

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.490 
a simple slice here and let's go ahead
and<00:00:18.119> play<00:00:18.480> through<00:00:18.779> what<00:00:18.960> we're<00:00:19.080> looking<00:00:19.380> at

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
and play through what we're looking at

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.040 
and play through what we're looking at
now<00:00:20.060> one<00:00:21.060> thing<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.300> point<00:00:21.449> out<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:21.810> we've

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
now one thing to point out is that we've

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.550 
now one thing to point out is that we've
increased<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.830> speed<00:00:23.359> of<00:00:24.359> tech<00:00:24.900> plot<00:00:25.170> when<00:00:25.470> it

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
increased the speed of tech plot when it

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.990 
increased the speed of tech plot when it
comes<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.890> unsteady<00:00:26.250> results<00:00:26.670> so<00:00:26.789> that<00:00:26.820> you

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
comes to unsteady results so that you

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.279 
comes to unsteady results so that you
can<00:00:27.150> actually<00:00:27.449> animate<00:00:27.840> through<00:00:28.050> very

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
can actually animate through very

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.919 
can actually animate through very
quickly<00:00:28.560> as<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:28.949> can<00:00:29.039> see<00:00:29.220> in<00:00:29.310> this<00:00:29.429> case<00:00:29.929> the

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
quickly as you can see in this case the

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.389 
quickly as you can see in this case the
solution<00:00:31.109> itself<00:00:31.679> we're<00:00:31.949> looking<00:00:32.250> at

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
solution itself we're looking at

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.690 
solution itself we're looking at
vorticity<00:00:32.759> magnitude<00:00:33.540> in<00:00:34.040> principle<00:00:35.040> if<00:00:35.399> we

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
vorticity magnitude in principle if we

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.370 
vorticity magnitude in principle if we
chose<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.300> look<00:00:36.510> at<00:00:36.660> something<00:00:36.930> like<00:00:36.960> pressure

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
chose to look at something like pressure

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.250 
chose to look at something like pressure
we<00:00:38.100> could<00:00:38.250> do<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.460> as<00:00:38.640> well<00:00:38.690> in<00:00:39.690> addition<00:00:39.930> we

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
we could do that as well in addition we

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.590 
we could do that as well in addition we
could<00:00:40.440> we've<00:00:41.100> speeded<00:00:41.399> up<00:00:41.640> stream<00:00:42.360> trace

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
could we've speeded up stream trace

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.180 
could we've speeded up stream trace
placement<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:43.500> in<00:00:43.649> this<00:00:43.800> case<00:00:43.980> we're<00:00:44.160> looking

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
placement so in this case we're looking

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.880 
placement so in this case we're looking
at<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.789> series<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.629> stream<00:00:45.960> traces<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:48.649> if<00:00:49.649> we

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
at a series of stream traces and if we

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.319 
at a series of stream traces and if we
then<00:00:50.280> again<00:00:51.239> go<00:00:51.420> through<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.750> animation<00:00:53.329> it's

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
then again go through the animation it's

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.240 
then again go through the animation it's
going<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.660> make<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.930> calculation<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.800> the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
going to make the calculation of the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.950 
going to make the calculation of the
stream<00:00:56.550> traces<00:00:56.969> on<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.120> fly<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.629> can<00:00:57.809> see

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
stream traces on the fly and you can see

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.290 
stream traces on the fly and you can see
it's<00:00:58.109> it's<00:00:59.039> pretty<00:00:59.370> quick<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.820> first<00:00:59.850> time<00:01:00.180> of

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
it's it's pretty quick the first time of

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.639 
it's it's pretty quick the first time of
course<00:01:00.449> once<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.840> makes<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.079> calculation

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
course once it makes the calculation

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.500 
course once it makes the calculation
going<00:01:02.370> through<00:01:02.609> this<00:01:02.699> again<00:01:02.969> would<00:01:03.120> be<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.300> lot

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
going through this again would be a lot

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.230 
going through this again would be a lot
faster<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.199> I'll<00:01:04.890> press<00:01:05.100> pause<00:01:05.339> on<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.729> I'll

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
faster so I'll press pause on that I'll

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.820 
faster so I'll press pause on that I'll
go<00:01:06.360> back<00:01:06.390> just<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.229> give<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.409> an<00:01:07.470> indication

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
go back just to give you an indication

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.500 
go back just to give you an indication
you<00:01:08.010> can<00:01:08.250> see<00:01:08.430> there<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.700> go<00:01:08.760> once<00:01:09.119> once<00:01:09.479> the

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
you can see there you go once once the

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.380 
you can see there you go once once the
calculations<00:01:10.080> are<00:01:10.170> made<00:01:10.880> when<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:11.909> comes<00:01:12.180> to

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
calculations are made when it comes to

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.499 
calculations are made when it comes to
export<00:01:13.080> capabilities<00:01:14.040> we<00:01:14.520> have<00:01:14.549> changed

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
export capabilities we have changed

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.929 
export capabilities we have changed
what's<00:01:15.900> available<00:01:16.110> in<00:01:16.530> principle<00:01:17.070> we<00:01:17.490> used<00:01:17.790> to

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
what's available in principle we used to

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.899 
what's available in principle we used to
support<00:01:18.240> just<00:01:18.600> flash<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.560> Evi<00:01:19.860> which<00:01:20.729> we

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
support just flash and Evi which we

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.969 
support just flash and Evi which we
still<00:01:21.119> support<00:01:21.750> however<00:01:22.049> we<00:01:22.380> have<00:01:22.470> asked<00:01:22.830> the

video<00:01:33.780> sorry<00:01:34.670> so<00:01:35.670> these<00:01:36.270> are<00:01:36.479> all<00:01:36.600> new

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049

video sorry so these are all new
capabilities<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.979> tend<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.610> like<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.970> Windows

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
capabilities I tend to like the Windows

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.539 
capabilities I tend to like the Windows
Media<00:01:39.990> Video<00:01:40.380> as<00:01:40.680> it's<00:01:40.979> quite<00:01:41.220> compatible

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
Media Video as it's quite compatible

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.359 
Media Video as it's quite compatible
with<00:01:41.970> things<00:01:42.210> like<00:01:42.450> PowerPoint<00:01:43.369> you'll

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
with things like PowerPoint you'll

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.929 
with things like PowerPoint you'll
notice<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.869> generating<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.790> animations<00:01:47.790> is

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
notice that generating the animations is

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.819 
notice that generating the animations is
the<00:01:48.090> same<00:01:48.360> in<00:01:48.600> principle<00:01:49.200> we<00:01:49.350> can<00:01:49.530> do<00:01:49.649> this

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
the same in principle we can do this

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.990 
the same in principle we can do this
with<00:01:50.070> anti-aliasing<00:01:51.229> we'll<00:01:52.229> look<00:01:52.350> at<00:01:52.560> say

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
with anti-aliasing we'll look at say

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.980 
with anti-aliasing we'll look at say
well<00:01:54.000> 15<00:01:54.899> frames<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.470> second<00:01:56.689> and<00:01:57.689> we'll<00:01:57.869> go

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
well 15 frames a second and we'll go

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.870 
well 15 frames a second and we'll go
ahead<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.380> generate<00:01:58.920> this<00:01:59.219> file<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.759> I'll

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
ahead and generate this file and I'll

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.620 
ahead and generate this file and I'll
put<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.420> out<00:02:00.509> on<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.810> desktop<00:02:01.549> so<00:02:02.549> that<00:02:03.270> we<00:02:03.479> can

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
put it out on the desktop so that we can

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.380 
put it out on the desktop so that we can
look<00:02:03.780> at<00:02:03.869> that<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.799> again<00:02:05.729> one<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.180> things

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
look at that and again one of the things

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.700 
look at that and again one of the things
that<00:02:06.540> we've<00:02:06.659> done<00:02:06.689> in<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.259> past<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.619> we

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
that we've done in the past and we

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.109 
that we've done in the past and we
continue<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.160> do<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.580> rendering<00:02:08.910> is<00:02:09.090> done

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
continue to do is the rendering is done

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.960 
continue to do is the rendering is done
off-screen<00:02:09.660> therefore<00:02:10.470> we<00:02:11.459> don't<00:02:11.640> have<00:02:11.819> to

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
off-screen therefore we don't have to

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
off-screen therefore we don't have to
update<00:02:12.120> anything<00:02:12.810> as<00:02:13.080> we're<00:02:13.260> going<00:02:13.470> through

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
update anything as we're going through

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.200 
update anything as we're going through
which<00:02:14.110> means<00:02:14.350> that<00:02:14.500> we<00:02:14.560> can<00:02:14.680> dump<00:02:14.920> these

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
which means that we can dump these

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.660 
which means that we can dump these
animations<00:02:16.210> out<00:02:16.390> a<00:02:16.600> little<00:02:17.170> more<00:02:17.380> rapidly<00:02:17.830> how

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
animations out a little more rapidly how

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.370 
animations out a little more rapidly how
the<00:02:18.730> animations<00:02:19.360> are<00:02:19.450> being<00:02:19.630> created<00:02:20.050> right

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
the animations are being created right

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.260 
the animations are being created right
now<00:02:20.980> what<00:02:21.190> it's<00:02:21.310> doing<00:02:21.550> is<00:02:21.640> generating<00:02:22.120> all

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
now what it's doing is generating all

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.000 
now what it's doing is generating all
the<00:02:22.480> images<00:02:22.960> once<00:02:23.290> it<00:02:23.410> has<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.680> images

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
the images once it has the images

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.500 
the images once it has the images
together<00:02:24.160> it<00:02:24.640> will<00:02:24.730> concatenate<00:02:25.390> them

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
together it will concatenate them

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.020 
together it will concatenate them
together<00:02:25.660> and<00:02:26.170> put<00:02:26.650> them<00:02:26.800> out<00:02:26.920> into<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:27.820> file

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
together and put them out into the file

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.090 
together and put them out into the file
so<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.690> progress<00:02:29.110> bar<00:02:29.350> doesn't<00:02:29.890> look<00:02:29.980> like

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
so the progress bar doesn't look like

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.210 
so the progress bar doesn't look like
it's<00:02:30.250> moving<00:02:30.420> but<00:02:31.420> that<00:02:31.540> typically<00:02:31.930> isn't<00:02:32.710> a

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
it's moving but that typically isn't a

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.330 
it's moving but that typically isn't a
typical<00:02:33.670> so<00:02:37.560> okay<00:02:38.560> you<00:02:38.620> can<00:02:38.740> see<00:02:39.010> it's<00:02:39.160> just

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
typical so okay you can see it's just

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.460 
typical so okay you can see it's just
about<00:02:39.520> done<00:02:39.930> kind<00:02:40.930> of<00:02:40.990> move<00:02:41.110> very<00:02:41.290> quickly

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
about done kind of move very quickly

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.530 
about done kind of move very quickly
here<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:43.650> once<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.860> images<00:02:45.460> are<00:02:45.760> put

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
here and once the images are put

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.120 
here and once the images are put
together<00:02:46.630> and<00:02:47.260> will<00:02:47.380> dump<00:02:47.560> out<00:02:47.710> the<00:02:47.860> imagery

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
together and will dump out the imagery

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.230 
together and will dump out the imagery
we<00:02:48.220> can<00:02:48.340> actually<00:02:48.670> take<00:02:48.820> a<00:02:48.850> look<00:02:49.000> at<00:02:49.120> that

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
we can actually take a look at that

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.090 
we can actually take a look at that
animation<00:02:49.930> video<00:02:50.200> okay<00:02:50.710> so<00:02:50.770> it<00:02:50.890> looks<00:02:51.040> like

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
animation video okay so it looks like

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:57.810 
animation video okay so it looks like
it's<00:02:51.310> done<00:02:51.430> and<00:02:52.950> if<00:02:53.950> we<00:02:54.790> pop<00:02:55.480> into<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:57.220> desktop

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
it's done and if we pop into the desktop

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.370 
it's done and if we pop into the desktop
here<00:02:58.180> we<00:02:58.390> can<00:02:58.570> find<00:02:58.900> that<00:02:59.110> video<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:02.200> I'll

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
here we can find that video and I'll

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.870 
here we can find that video and I'll
just<00:03:02.560> quickly<00:03:03.130> look<00:03:03.490> at<00:03:03.580> that<00:03:03.730> now<00:03:05.640> I'll<00:03:06.640> bring

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
just quickly look at that now I'll bring

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.900 
just quickly look at that now I'll bring
it<00:03:07.030> into<00:03:07.180> focus<00:03:07.420> here<00:03:07.840> so<00:03:08.020> you<00:03:08.140> can<00:03:08.290> see<00:03:08.440> it<00:03:08.560> and

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
it into focus here so you can see it and

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.850 
it into focus here so you can see it and
there's<00:03:09.910> our<00:03:10.150> simple<00:03:10.840> image<00:03:11.110> showing<00:03:11.740> the

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
there's our simple image showing the

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.130 
there's our simple image showing the
animation<00:03:12.310> and<00:03:12.490> that's<00:03:13.420> some<00:03:13.870> of<00:03:13.960> the<00:03:13.990> new

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
animation and that's some of the new

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.080 
animation and that's some of the new
capabilities<00:03:14.320> for<00:03:14.800> recording<00:03:15.460> animations<00:03:15.910> in

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
capabilities for recording animations in

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.880 
capabilities for recording animations in
