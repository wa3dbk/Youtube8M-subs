00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.260
 welcome to this video lesson about the range of the plants 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.680
 the jones disease canceled previously held three divisions in the plant kingdom 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:09.630
 what i know brands 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.630
 the ones we use to do in parts of the country 

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:16.239
 and that difference is between the school and the singer 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.220
 first a short repetition 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.869
 we have a good plan is more 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:23.220
 who divide into different groups 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.319
 we call that ordering 

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:27.730
 the ears and organisms that are richer 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.079
 there are four different neighborhoods 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:31.949
 bacteria and 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.160
 of the fungi 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.280
 of the plants 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.940
 and of the animals 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.610
 the distribution within ranges 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.610
 a group a new shares 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.320
 today we are going to talk about clearing the plants 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.250
 that consists of the three departments 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.470
 finding the good for it 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.030
 that there are the following characteristics 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.440
 or has a plant root 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.790
 of plant stems 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.290
 approaching has 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.290
 has flowers and then the way of reproduction 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.480
 the three departments within the plant kingdom 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.810
 I am thinking of this 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.049
 track plants 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.560
 we were planting 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.560
 and maintain three departments in this order 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.720
 so we start with the juniors 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.610
 animals 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:19.590
 go already 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.830
 team is actually four characteristics 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.840
 they have no roots spirit english no leaves 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.860
 no flowers 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.570
 they threaten something in the water 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.590
 are different types of beer 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.480
 namely one-sided way 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.050
 inshared a cell 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.050
 and reproduction is usually cell division 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.980
 therefore many themselves and animals 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.890
 which consists of multiple cells 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.440
 and reproduction place 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.440
 because pieces are tearing off and now growing 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.940
 then plant the spores to the second section 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.780
 Scotland has the following characteristics 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.620
 the first part must be us 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.030
 includes english 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.390
 well blaton 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.910
 after no flowers 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.910
 reproduction no place by rail 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.080
 We are not good for customers there 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.080
 which we give all three when we visit 

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:16.679
 before we do that we will look at some traces of boring 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:20.979
 track itself can grow out of the new plant 

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:23.979
 they are not jewelry 

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:28.939
 the first plan that is admittedly the moss 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:30.930
 mosul contain rail boxes 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.209
 and in those boxes 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.609
 well i'm the spurs 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:37.639
 mussels are often small plants with very small leaves 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.050
 next plant 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.379
 so experienced guide 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.200
 vara send traces on it 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.200
 at the bottom of the large leaves 

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:50.150
 the track heaps 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.589
 the boys were without a trace 

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:55.589
 the mission and life cycle of a sailing 

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:00.899
 finally we have the ponytail and 

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:03.899
 it is therefore a lot at the bicycle storage after school 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.789
 equine states have also started spur forming 

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:10.789
 you see them somewhere in the picture 

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:14.709
 French consisting of a stem with tubes 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.709
 You can also remove those tubes from the votes 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:23.389
 the old earth a last section namely owned plants 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.669
 she had offered us a healing land 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:31.009
 leaves with flowers or flowers 

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:32.699
 and reproduction 

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:34.449
 let them saddle up 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:37.449
 that arise like a flower 

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:41.679
 stand our ground in flowers 

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:44.659
 the killing is erased about start mail 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:46.609
 according to opponents 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:49.019
 fertilization also takes place 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.389
 I think it's growing out for the gym 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.389
 fooling us in flight 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.269
 I have two classes 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.959
 namely plant the seeds naked 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.469
 the work 

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:04.760
 their nudes 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.080
 we have about one hundred and thirty among the debts 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.080
 of for example 4 this pine cone 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:13.309
 when the scales 

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:16.309
 then the halls give birth so hard 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:20.509
 the company is coming Saturday to Sunday 6 

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:24.490
 citi with this christmas 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.830
 is the sword 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.590
 a true enthusiasts 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.809
 what do you need to know at the end of this video 

00:04:31.809 --> 00:04:34.999
 the other three Dutch possess 

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:38.559
 what the characteristics are to use to divide the plants into the 

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:40.029
 departments 

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:43.340
 the difference is between schoorl and seeds 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.600
 these adults 58 to successfully because you are still young is through
