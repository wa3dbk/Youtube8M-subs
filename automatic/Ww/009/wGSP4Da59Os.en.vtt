great<00:02:10.560> british<00:02:10.830> pounds

great british pounds

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.180 
great british pounds
then<00:02:12.209> is<00:02:12.330> ninety<00:02:12.720> percent<00:02:12.870> of<00:02:13.260> that<00:02:13.319> and

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
then is ninety percent of that and

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.729 
then is ninety percent of that and
that's<00:02:14.400> on<00:02:14.640> leaf<00:02:14.790> like<00:02:14.910> 26<00:02:15.420> days<00:02:15.599> all<00:02:15.810> over<00:02:15.989> the

that's on leaf like 26 days all over the

that's on leaf like 26 days all over the
analytics<00:02:17.250> shows<00:02:17.459> but<00:02:17.670> i<00:02:17.730> think<00:02:17.940> it's<00:02:18.090> about

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
analytics shows but i think it's about

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.330 
analytics shows but i think it's about
fifty<00:02:18.569> dollars<00:02:18.870> i<00:02:18.959> didn't<00:02:19.170> really<00:02:19.319> check<00:02:19.709> but

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
fifty dollars i didn't really check but

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.949 
fifty dollars i didn't really check but
i<00:02:20.370> think<00:02:20.760> it's<00:02:21.030> somewhere<00:02:21.300> on<00:02:21.360> that<00:02:21.569> i<00:02:21.750> don't

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
i think it's somewhere on that i don't

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.809 
i think it's somewhere on that i don't
really<00:02:22.080> check<00:02:22.319> it<00:02:22.470> that<00:02:22.590> often<00:02:22.819> and

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
really check it that often and

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.180 
really check it that often and
essentially<00:02:24.150> i'll<00:02:24.330> get<00:02:24.540> that<00:02:24.569> like<00:02:24.930> not<00:02:25.319> next

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
essentially i'll get that like not next

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.009 
essentially i'll get that like not next
month<00:02:26.310> but<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.849> month<00:02:27.030> after<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:27.750> i'll<00:02:27.840> get

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
month but the month after and i'll get

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.500 
month but the month after and i'll get
that<00:02:28.050> amount<00:02:28.349> of<00:02:28.470> money<00:02:28.700> for<00:02:29.700> my<00:02:29.879> videos<00:02:30.209> and<00:02:30.450> i

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
different people on youtube there's I'd

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:20.840 
different people on youtube there's I'd
say<00:03:19.889> there's<00:03:20.069> about<00:03:20.100> three<00:03:20.549> there<00:03:20.730> may<00:03:20.819> be

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
say there's about three there may be

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.819 
say there's about three there may be
more<00:03:21.060> but<00:03:21.269> these<00:03:21.359> are<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.660> primarily<00:03:22.380> three

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
more but these are the primarily three

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:24.650 
more but these are the primarily three
categories<00:03:23.670> you<00:03:23.790> can<00:03:23.880> split<00:03:24.090> most<00:03:24.420> of<00:03:24.600> the

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
categories you can split most of the

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.080 
categories you can split most of the
people<00:03:24.989> up<00:03:25.170> to<00:03:25.530> so<00:03:26.100> there's<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.400> people<00:03:26.730> that

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
people up to so there's the people that

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.150 
people up to so there's the people that
straight<00:03:27.540> up<00:03:27.569> just<00:03:28.019> do<00:03:28.230> YouTube<00:03:28.680> for<00:03:28.980> money

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
straight up just do YouTube for money

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.300 
straight up just do YouTube for money
they'll<00:03:29.690> beg<00:03:30.690> companies<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:31.739> send<00:03:31.950> them<00:03:32.069> stuff

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
they'll beg companies to send them stuff

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.490 
they'll beg companies to send them stuff
which<00:03:32.489> I<00:03:32.700> do<00:03:32.760> but<00:03:33.120> I<00:03:33.269> mean<00:03:33.420> they<00:03:33.720> never<00:03:33.930> say<00:03:34.139> yes

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
which I do but I mean they never say yes

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.030 
which I do but I mean they never say yes
so<00:03:34.829> it<00:03:34.920> doesn't<00:03:35.190> count<00:03:36.349> they'll<00:03:37.349> like<00:03:37.590> they'll

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
so it doesn't count they'll like they'll

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.099 
so it doesn't count they'll like they'll
just<00:03:38.310> make<00:03:38.579> sure<00:03:38.849> they<00:03:38.880> can<00:03:39.180> maximize<00:03:39.660> as<00:03:39.840> much

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
just make sure they can maximize as much

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.759 
just make sure they can maximize as much
money<00:03:40.410> as<00:03:40.530> they<00:03:40.650> can<00:03:40.769> from<00:03:41.459> YouTube<00:03:42.739> where<00:03:43.739> a

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
money as they can from YouTube where a

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.199 
money as they can from YouTube where a
lot<00:03:44.099> of<00:03:44.130> times<00:03:44.370> they'll<00:03:44.519> hinder<00:03:44.849> like<00:03:45.030> what

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
lot of times they'll hinder like what

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.030 
lot of times they'll hinder like what
the<00:03:45.299> actual<00:03:45.419> video<00:03:45.750> is<00:03:45.810> about<00:03:45.959> to<00:03:46.829> make<00:03:46.980> sure

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
the actual video is about to make sure

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.370 
the actual video is about to make sure
they<00:03:47.459> make<00:03:47.669> more<00:03:47.849> money<00:03:47.970> then<00:03:48.959> there's<00:03:49.139> people

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
they make more money then there's people

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.539 
they make more money then there's people
that<00:03:49.410> just<00:03:49.620> do<00:03:49.709> YouTube<00:03:50.040> because<00:03:50.130> it's<00:03:50.340> fun

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
that just do YouTube because it's fun

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.550 
that just do YouTube because it's fun
and<00:03:50.579> I<00:03:51.000> think<00:03:51.030> I'd<00:03:51.359> sell<00:03:51.810> into<00:03:52.230> that<00:03:52.349> category

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
and I think I'd sell into that category

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.589 
and I think I'd sell into that category
because<00:03:52.919> I<00:03:53.220> always<00:03:53.639> said<00:03:53.910> I'd<00:03:54.090> make<00:03:54.239> videos

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
because I always said I'd make videos

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.509 
because I always said I'd make videos
until<00:03:54.930> I<00:03:54.989> got<00:03:55.200> bored<00:03:55.410> of<00:03:55.590> doing<00:03:55.769> so<00:03:56.160> I'm<00:03:56.400> not

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
until I got bored of doing so I'm not

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.400 
until I got bored of doing so I'm not
what<00:03:57.150> happened<00:03:57.599> I<00:03:57.660> kind<00:03:57.870> of<00:03:57.959> burnt<00:03:58.139> out<00:03:58.290> from

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
what happened I kind of burnt out from

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.470 
what happened I kind of burnt out from
making<00:03:58.709> videos<00:03:59.010> and<00:03:59.579> I<00:03:59.639> just<00:03:59.849> didn't<00:04:00.269> make

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
making videos and I just didn't make

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.879

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:03.830
