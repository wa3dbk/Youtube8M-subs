00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
have down hold on it a little bit not

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.950 
have down hold on it a little bit not
really<00:02:19.580> I<00:02:19.610> mean<00:02:19.640> I<00:02:19.850> belly<00:02:20.300> racer<00:02:20.690> for<00:02:20.870> that<00:02:21.250> but

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
really I mean I belly racer for that but

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.330 
really I mean I belly racer for that but
basically<00:02:23.960> the<00:02:24.680> only<00:02:24.800> thing<00:02:25.040> I<00:02:25.130> can<00:02:25.190> really

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
basically the only thing I can really

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.190 
basically the only thing I can really
find<00:02:25.580> wrong<00:02:26.090> with<00:02:26.120> it<00:02:26.360> is<00:02:26.450> a<00:02:26.660> little<00:02:26.900> bit<00:02:27.050> on

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
find wrong with it is a little bit on

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.460 
find wrong with it is a little bit on
the<00:02:27.290> long<00:02:27.560> side<00:02:28.450> it's<00:02:29.450> like<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.810> effective

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
the long side it's like the effective

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.000 
the long side it's like the effective
foot<00:02:31.100> platform<00:02:31.370> is<00:02:31.820> like<00:02:31.970> pretty<00:02:32.240> big<00:02:32.980> so<00:02:33.980> I

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
foot platform is like pretty big so I

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.710 
foot platform is like pretty big so I
mean<00:02:34.220> if<00:02:34.370> you're<00:02:34.490> like<00:02:34.670> I'm<00:02:34.850> like<00:02:35.030> 5-10<00:02:35.510> so

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
mean if you're like I'm like 5-10 so

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.980 
mean if you're like I'm like 5-10 so
it's<00:02:35.840> ok<00:02:37.000> but<00:02:38.000> like<00:02:38.120> if<00:02:38.180> you're<00:02:38.300> a<00:02:38.450> shorter

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
it's ok but like if you're a shorter

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.260 
it's ok but like if you're a shorter
rider<00:02:39.260> I<00:02:39.440> wouldn't<00:02:40.400> suggest<00:02:40.550> getting<00:02:40.970> it

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
rider I wouldn't suggest getting it

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.850 
rider I wouldn't suggest getting it
because<00:02:41.420> it's<00:02:41.840> going<00:02:42.170> to<00:02:42.230> be<00:02:42.320> a<00:02:42.350> little<00:02:42.680> bit

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
because it's going to be a little bit

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.130 
because it's going to be a little bit
too<00:02:42.980> big<00:02:43.130> for<00:02:43.370> you<00:02:43.490> but<00:02:43.700> you<00:02:44.150> still<00:02:44.630> could<00:02:44.870> ride

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
too big for you but you still could ride

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.870 
too big for you but you still could ride
it<00:02:45.320> you<00:02:45.470> just<00:02:45.530> don't<00:02:46.160> have<00:02:46.280> to<00:02:46.400> get<00:02:46.550> used<00:02:46.760> to

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
it you just don't have to get used to

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.240 
it you just don't have to get used to
the<00:02:47.000> big<00:02:47.210> wheel<00:02:47.450> base<00:02:47.660> and<00:02:47.900> stuff<00:02:48.020> like<00:02:48.170> that

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
the big wheel base and stuff like that

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.520 
the big wheel base and stuff like that
but<00:02:49.250> I<00:02:49.310> mean<00:02:49.550> you<00:02:50.390> can<00:02:50.510> do<00:02:50.600> flip<00:02:50.870> tricks<00:02:51.140> on<00:02:51.320> it

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
but I mean you can do flip tricks on it

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.320 
but I mean you can do flip tricks on it
if<00:02:51.800> you're<00:02:52.010> into<00:02:52.250> that<00:02:52.310> stuff<00:02:52.640> flatland<00:02:53.209> the

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
if you're into that stuff flatland the

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.540 
if you're into that stuff flatland the
details<00:02:53.930> are<00:02:54.200> decent<00:02:54.830> enough<00:02:54.980> big<00:02:55.190> enough<00:02:55.340> for

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
details are decent enough big enough for

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.699 
details are decent enough big enough for
that<00:02:55.670> stuff<00:02:57.670> sliding<00:02:58.670> huge<00:02:59.000> slides<00:02:59.709> basically

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
that stuff sliding huge slides basically

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:01.990 
that stuff sliding huge slides basically
anything<00:03:00.920> you<00:03:01.100> want<00:03:01.310> to<00:03:01.370> throw<00:03:01.580> it<00:03:01.610> at<00:03:01.850> this

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
anything you want to throw it at this

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.820 
anything you want to throw it at this
board<00:03:02.270> can<00:03:02.570> handle<00:03:02.959> it's<00:03:03.080> got<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:03.320> concave

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
board can handle it's got the concave

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.699 
board can handle it's got the concave
for<00:03:04.130> its<00:03:04.459> got<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:04.670> features<00:03:05.300> for<00:03:05.600> it<00:03:05.720> locks<00:03:06.350> in

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
for its got the features for it locks in

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.060 
for its got the features for it locks in
the<00:03:06.740> rockers<00:03:07.310> great<00:03:07.640> the<00:03:08.510> w's<00:03:08.930> great<00:03:09.290> really

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
the rockers great the w's great really

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.940 
the rockers great the w's great really
can<00:03:10.360> find<00:03:11.360> and<00:03:11.630> better<00:03:11.900> board<00:03:12.290> better<00:03:12.650> like

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
can find and better board better like

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.820 
can find and better board better like
freeride<00:03:13.430> drop<00:03:13.790> through<00:03:14.000> board<00:03:14.650> like<00:03:15.650> that

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
freeride drop through board like that

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.070 
freeride drop through board like that
has<00:03:16.010> enough<00:03:16.430> this<00:03:16.730> stuff<00:03:17.000> on<00:03:17.300> it<00:03:17.330> maybe<00:03:17.720> like

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
has enough this stuff on it maybe like

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.350 
has enough this stuff on it maybe like
it's<00:03:18.560> really<00:03:18.920> comparable<00:03:19.430> to<00:03:19.670> like<00:03:19.790> in<00:03:19.910> Nelson

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
it's really comparable to like in Nelson

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.820 
it's really comparable to like in Nelson
uh<00:03:21.160> what<00:03:22.160> are<00:03:22.190> those<00:03:22.340> spindrift<00:03:23.260> yeah<00:03:24.260> Nelson

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
uh what are those spindrift yeah Nelson

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.100 
uh what are those spindrift yeah Nelson
spindrift<00:03:25.160> that's<00:03:25.489> like<00:03:25.700> what<00:03:26.480> this<00:03:26.660> board<00:03:26.959> is

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
spindrift that's like what this board is

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.560 
spindrift that's like what this board is
it<00:03:27.260> doesn't<00:03:27.620> have<00:03:27.739> the<00:03:28.130> type<00:03:28.580> of<00:03:28.610> concave<00:03:29.150> but

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
it doesn't have the type of concave but

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.240 
it doesn't have the type of concave but
yeah<00:03:30.530> it's<00:03:30.680> pretty<00:03:30.890> similar<00:03:31.190> to<00:03:31.340> that<00:03:33.010> so<00:03:34.010> yeah

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
yeah it's pretty similar to that so yeah

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.040 
yeah it's pretty similar to that so yeah
guys<00:03:34.430> if<00:03:34.910> you're<00:03:35.030> looking<00:03:35.150> for<00:03:35.300> a<00:03:35.480> nice<00:03:35.750> free
