00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
this product right here this is pretty

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.290 
this product right here this is pretty
much<00:00:43.260> just<00:00:43.680> like<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:44.129> clarisonic<00:00:44.700> but<00:00:45.120> it's<00:00:45.239> a

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
much just like a clarisonic but it's a

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.840 
much just like a clarisonic but it's a
little<00:00:45.600> bit<00:00:45.719> smaller<00:00:46.079> when<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.129> try<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.430> on<00:00:47.579> it

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
little bit smaller when you try it on it

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.869 
little bit smaller when you try it on it
has<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.750> first<00:00:49.140> speed<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.829> then<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.430> has<00:00:50.640> a

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
has the first speed and then it has a

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.930 
has the first speed and then it has a
higher<00:00:51.360> speed<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:53.070> can<00:00:53.280> see<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.760> this

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
higher speed so you can see that this

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.490 
higher speed so you can see that this
one's<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.239> little<00:00:54.329> bit<00:00:54.570> higher<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.079> then<00:00:55.230> it

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
one's a little bit higher and then it

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.130 
one's a little bit higher and then it
can<00:00:55.710> be<00:00:55.829> lower<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.550> personally<00:00:57.390> use<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.719> on<00:00:57.899> the

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
can be lower I personally use it on the

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.200 
can be lower I personally use it on the
low<00:00:58.379> speed<00:00:58.680> on<00:00:58.980> my<00:00:59.129> skin<00:00:59.399> just<00:00:59.430> because<00:00:59.969> my

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
low speed on my skin just because my

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.599 
low speed on my skin just because my
skin<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.660> little<00:01:00.750> bit<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:02.100> doesn't<00:01:02.460> like

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
skin is a little bit it doesn't like

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.880 
skin is a little bit it doesn't like
heavy<00:01:03.030> heavy<00:01:04.189> exfoliation<00:01:05.930> so<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.650> brush

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.210 

3999<00:01:37.020> i<00:01:37.200> think<00:01:37.530> so<00:01:37.710> i<00:01:37.740> think<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:38.070> was<00:01:38.130> about

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
3999 i think so i think it was about

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.719 
3999 i think so i think it was about
forty<00:01:38.820> dollars<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:40.079> this<00:01:40.290> was<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.729> limited

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
forty dollars and this was a limited

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.880 
forty dollars and this was a limited
edition<00:01:41.970> one<00:01:42.479> but<00:01:42.780> i<00:01:42.810> got<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.170> about<00:01:43.259> two<00:01:43.710> weeks

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
edition one but i got it about two weeks

personally I don't get too many

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.950 
personally I don't get too many
breakouts<00:02:37.580> if<00:02:37.790> they<00:02:37.940> do<00:02:38.000> they're<00:02:38.390> on<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.630> chin

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
breakouts if they do they're on the chin

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.390 
breakouts if they do they're on the chin
and<00:02:38.990> they're<00:02:39.290> really<00:02:39.530> deep<00:02:39.980> and<00:02:40.220> like

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
and they're really deep and like

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.590 
and they're really deep and like
hormonal<00:02:41.120> so<00:02:41.780> I<00:02:41.810> don't<00:02:42.380> really<00:02:42.530> have<00:02:43.600> problems

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
hormonal so I don't really have problems

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.170 
hormonal so I don't really have problems
with<00:02:44.960> breakouts<00:02:45.380> to<00:02:45.740> products<00:02:46.490> and<00:02:46.730> I've<00:02:47.030> been

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
with breakouts to products and I've been

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.060 
with breakouts to products and I've been
using<00:02:47.390> this<00:02:47.690> guy<00:02:47.930> for<00:02:48.350> about<00:02:48.380> one<00:02:48.890> or<00:02:49.010> two

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
using this guy for about one or two

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.370 
using this guy for about one or two
weeks<00:02:49.400> and<00:02:49.700> I<00:02:50.180> haven't<00:02:50.210> seen<00:02:50.660> a<00:02:50.690> breakout<00:02:51.200> or

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
weeks and I haven't seen a breakout or

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.260 
weeks and I haven't seen a breakout or
anything<00:02:51.770> but<00:02:51.890> I<00:02:51.950> have<00:02:52.250> noticed<00:02:52.700> my<00:02:52.790> skin

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
anything but I have noticed my skin

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.050 
anything but I have noticed my skin
looks<00:02:53.720> so<00:02:54.500> much<00:02:54.710> better<00:02:54.920> you<00:02:55.070> guys<00:02:55.340> I<00:02:55.670> can't

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
looks so much better you guys I can't

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.520 
looks so much better you guys I can't
even<00:02:56.270> tell<00:02:56.510> you<00:02:56.570> how<00:02:56.690> much<00:02:56.930> better<00:02:57.170> it<00:02:57.500> looks

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
even tell you how much better it looks

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.550 
even tell you how much better it looks
so<00:02:58.400> I<00:02:58.760> think<00:02:59.480> that's<00:02:59.750> it<00:02:59.990> if<00:03:00.110> you<00:03:00.200> have<00:03:00.350> any

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
so I think that's it if you have any

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.200 
so I think that's it if you have any
questions<00:03:01.040> on<00:03:01.220> this<00:03:01.250> little<00:03:01.580> guy<00:03:01.760> then<00:03:02.060> leave

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.210 
questions on this little guy then leave
