after<00:03:03.340> a<00:03:03.370> little<00:03:03.550> while<00:03:03.790> I<00:03:04.000> found<00:03:04.660> that<00:03:05.020> I

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
after a little while I found that I

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.750 
after a little while I found that I
tried<00:03:06.160> that<00:03:06.340> with<00:03:06.670> our<00:03:07.950> tank<00:03:08.950> destroyers<00:03:09.520> that

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
tried that with our tank destroyers that

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.600 
tried that with our tank destroyers that
I<00:03:09.790> have<00:03:10.330> as<00:03:11.020> well<00:03:11.670> it<00:03:12.670> works<00:03:13.480> up<00:03:13.810> to<00:03:14.410> a<00:03:14.440> certain

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
I have as well it works up to a certain

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.400 
I have as well it works up to a certain
tier<00:03:15.610> that<00:03:16.000> you<00:03:16.180> should<00:03:16.450> move<00:03:16.720> should<00:03:17.140> move

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
tier that you should move should move

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.840 
tier that you should move should move
because<00:03:17.860> they<00:03:18.780> later<00:03:19.780> tank<00:03:20.290> destroyers<00:03:20.920> when

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
because they later tank destroyers when

because they later tank destroyers when
it<00:03:22.000> comes<00:03:22.209> to<00:03:22.420> the<00:03:22.510> German<00:03:22.930> ones<00:03:23.170> are<00:03:23.470> just<00:03:23.500> not

it comes to the German ones are just not

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.979 
it comes to the German ones are just not
agile<00:03:24.730> enough<00:03:25.090> to<00:03:25.390> for<00:03:25.810> that<00:03:25.959> behavior<00:03:26.170> um<00:03:27.989> but

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
agile enough to for that behavior um but

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.920 
agile enough to for that behavior um but
the<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:30.520> medium<00:03:30.850> tier<00:03:31.150> and<00:03:31.360> the<00:03:31.420> low<00:03:31.630> tier

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
the the medium tier and the low tier

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.500 
the the medium tier and the low tier
tank<00:03:32.200> destroys<00:03:32.680> the<00:03:33.040> app<00:03:33.220> for<00:03:33.580> sure<00:03:33.850> you<00:03:34.300> can

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
tank destroys the app for sure you can

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:42.540 
tank destroys the app for sure you can
do<00:03:34.660> not<00:03:35.340> and<00:03:36.630> this<00:03:37.630> is<00:03:38.310> well<00:03:39.310> I<00:03:41.130> think<00:03:42.130> it's

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
do not and this is well I think it's

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:49.290 
do not and this is well I think it's
pretty<00:03:44.610> effective<00:03:45.610> if<00:03:46.680> you<00:03:47.680> judge<00:03:48.370> it<00:03:48.400> based

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
pretty effective if you judge it based

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.530 
pretty effective if you judge it based
on<00:03:49.570> this<00:03:49.780> gameplay

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.080 

yeah<00:03:53.439> there's<00:03:53.799> one<00:03:54.129> other<00:03:54.640> thing<00:03:55.260> today<00:03:56.260> is

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.170 
I might be the 20th the move will
finally<00:04:20.350> happen<00:04:21.990> that<00:04:22.990> was<00:04:23.169> my<00:04:23.580> the<00:04:24.580> noise<00:04:24.789> was

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.340 
yeah I don't know what I was doing there
and<00:06:27.130> waiting<00:06:27.910> maybe<00:06:28.120> I<00:06:28.270> got<00:06:28.570> distracted<00:06:28.780> from

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:29.350 
and waiting maybe I got distracted from

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:36.890 
and waiting maybe I got distracted from
something<00:06:29.890> in<00:06:30.220> the<00:06:34.050> in<00:06:35.050> the<00:06:35.110> room<00:06:35.470> but<00:06:35.800> oh<00:06:36.190> well

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 
something in the in the room but oh well

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.720 
something in the in the room but oh well
so<00:06:37.900> my<00:06:38.140> thinking<00:06:38.380> now<00:06:38.710> was<00:06:39.040> to<00:06:39.070> get<00:06:39.460> the

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:39.730 
so my thinking now was to get the

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:42.270 
so my thinking now was to get the
capping<00:06:40.210> done<00:06:40.450> I<00:06:40.960> couldn't<00:06:41.440> get<00:06:41.620> hold<00:06:41.800> of<00:06:42.040> that

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:42.280 
capping done I couldn't get hold of that

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.330 
capping done I couldn't get hold of that
Archie<00:06:42.850> there<00:06:43.090> and<00:06:43.510> there<00:06:44.110> was<00:06:44.290> two<00:06:44.890> artists

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:45.340

about<00:07:00.880> that<00:07:01.600> is<00:07:01.870> the<00:07:02.290> implementation<00:07:03.130> of<00:07:03.700> the

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:03.970 
about that is the implementation of the

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:07.170 
about that is the implementation of the
French<00:07:04.300> tanks<00:07:04.600> I<00:07:04.870> am<00:07:05.220> still<00:07:06.220> really<00:07:06.580> thrilled

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:07.180

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:21.330 
I mean in particular I'm talking about
the<00:07:18.280> reload<00:07:19.240> mechanism<00:07:20.050> for<00:07:20.950> the<00:07:21.040> French

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:21.340 
the reload mechanism for the French

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:25.260 
the reload mechanism for the French
tanks<00:07:21.640> you<00:07:21.880> know<00:07:21.910> you<00:07:22.480> preload<00:07:23.470> six<00:07:24.280> shells

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:25.270 
tanks you know you preload six shells

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:28.800 
tanks you know you preload six shells
into<00:07:25.720> a<00:07:25.990> magazine<00:07:26.680> and<00:07:26.920> then<00:07:27.580> within<00:07:27.850> 2.5

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:28.810 
into a magazine and then within 2.5

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:32.910 
into a magazine and then within 2.5
seconds<00:07:29.530> you<00:07:29.770> can<00:07:30.720> shoot<00:07:31.720> one<00:07:32.140> bullet<00:07:32.350> after

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:32.920 
seconds you can shoot one bullet after

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.610 
seconds you can shoot one bullet after
another<00:07:33.190> and<00:07:33.490> then<00:07:34.090> you<00:07:34.510> have<00:07:34.750> a<00:07:34.780> really<00:07:35.590> long

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:35.620 
another and then you have a really long

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:38.250 
another and then you have a really long
reload<00:07:36.190> time<00:07:36.460> again<00:07:36.850> and<00:07:37.120> I<00:07:37.330> really<00:07:37.720> like<00:07:38.050> that

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:38.260 
reload time again and I really like that

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:42.000 
reload time again and I really like that
I<00:07:38.910> don't<00:07:39.910> know<00:07:40.090> why<00:07:40.360> many<00:07:40.870> people<00:07:40.960> don't<00:07:41.590> don't

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:42.010
