00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:41.180 

that<00:03:34.830> was<00:03:34.980> all<00:03:35.129> right

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.830 

see<00:03:42.190> actually<00:03:42.550> that<00:03:42.580> fish<00:03:42.850> wouldn't<00:03:43.240> know<00:03:43.300> he

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
see actually that fish wouldn't know he

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.330 
see actually that fish wouldn't know he
wasn't<00:03:44.050> up<00:03:44.200> against<00:03:44.560> the<00:03:44.650> wall<00:03:44.830> which<00:03:45.190> is

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
wasn't up against the wall which is

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.590 
wasn't up against the wall which is
surprising<00:03:45.970> i<00:03:46.030> mean<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.240> water's<00:03:46.570> up<00:03:46.890> so<00:03:47.890> high

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
surprising i mean the water's up so high

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.460 
surprising i mean the water's up so high
you<00:03:49.600> would<00:03:49.750> think<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:50.200> fish<00:03:51.870> you<00:03:52.870> know<00:03:53.050> he<00:03:53.290> was

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
you would think the fish you know he was

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.380 
you would think the fish you know he was
i<00:03:53.620> was<00:03:53.950> actually<00:03:54.040> kind<00:03:54.400> of<00:03:54.460> just<00:03:54.640> swimming<00:03:55.300> the

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
i was actually kind of just swimming the

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.240 
i was actually kind of just swimming the
jig<00:03:55.600> back<00:03:55.840> in<00:03:56.080> you<00:03:56.290> know<00:03:58.530> and<00:03:59.530> he<00:03:59.770> was<00:03:59.890> off<00:04:00.070> the

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
jig back in you know and he was off the

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.420 
jig back in you know and he was off the
baton<00:04:00.550> and<00:04:00.610> i<00:04:00.670> might<00:04:00.880> tell<00:04:01.120> us<00:04:01.150> something<00:04:02.430> you

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.550 
baton and i might tell us something you
know<00:04:03.550> for<00:04:03.730> whatever<00:04:03.880> reason<00:04:04.420> he<00:04:05.230> wasn't<00:04:05.470> up

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
know for whatever reason he wasn't up

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.600 
know for whatever reason he wasn't up
against<00:04:05.920> that<00:04:06.550> wall<00:04:06.610> there<00:04:06.880> or<00:04:07.450> maybe<00:04:08.610> maybe

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
against that wall there or maybe maybe

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:19.129
