each<00:02:22.160> leg<00:02:22.489> is<00:02:22.760> individually<00:02:23.390> controlled<00:02:23.840> by

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
each leg is individually controlled by

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.650 
each leg is individually controlled by
its<00:02:24.170> own<00:02:24.319> trigger<00:02:25.000> now<00:02:26.000> another<00:02:26.360> way<00:02:26.599> to

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
its own trigger now another way to

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.390 
its own trigger now another way to
adjust<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.200> leg<00:02:27.349> is<00:02:27.530> pull<00:02:27.739> the<00:02:27.830> trigger<00:02:28.160> in

and then you can pull the leg to

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.680 
and then you can pull the leg to
whatever<00:02:30.560> height<00:02:30.860> you<00:02:30.890> like<00:02:31.120> here<00:02:32.120> I<00:02:32.300> have<00:02:32.390> it

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
whatever height you like here I have it

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.350 
whatever height you like here I have it
sitting<00:02:32.900> on<00:02:33.080> an<00:02:33.200> angle<00:02:33.849> don't<00:02:34.849> ask<00:02:35.030> me<00:02:35.209> why

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
sitting on an angle don't ask me why

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.259 
sitting on an angle don't ask me why
it's<00:02:35.900> just<00:02:36.200> for<00:02:36.349> illustration<00:02:36.739> purposes<00:02:37.340> so

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
it's just for illustration purposes so

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:39.910 
it's just for illustration purposes so
here<00:02:38.420> I<00:02:38.450> am<00:02:38.540> bringing<00:02:38.989> the<00:02:39.200> legs<00:02:39.410> in<00:02:39.620> once

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
here I am bringing the legs in once

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.970 
here I am bringing the legs in once
again<00:02:40.099> as<00:02:41.000> I<00:02:41.150> said<00:02:41.390> each<00:02:41.630> leg<00:02:41.989> is<00:02:42.260> individually

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
again as I said each leg is individually

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.490 
again as I said each leg is individually
controlled<00:02:43.400> so<00:02:43.700> you<00:02:43.760> can<00:02:43.910> have<00:02:44.120> every<00:02:44.900> single

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
controlled so you can have every single

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.100 
controlled so you can have every single
leg<00:02:45.769> at<00:02:45.980> a<00:02:46.069> different<00:02:46.459> height<00:02:46.630> now<00:02:47.630> as<00:02:47.810> you<00:02:47.989> can

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
leg at a different height now as you can

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.300 
leg at a different height now as you can
see<00:02:48.170> it<00:02:48.590> doesn't<00:02:48.860> balance<00:02:49.010> very<00:02:49.280> well

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.490 

now<00:02:53.670> a<00:02:53.700> neat<00:02:54.030> trick<00:02:54.300> which<00:02:54.660> I<00:02:54.780> just<00:02:54.990> realized

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
now a neat trick which I just realized

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.600 
now a neat trick which I just realized
this<00:02:55.680> tripod<00:02:56.220> can<00:02:56.430> do<00:02:56.610> is<00:02:57.030> lay<00:02:57.330> almost<00:02:57.810> flat<00:02:58.650> to

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
this tripod can do is lay almost flat to

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.300 
this tripod can do is lay almost flat to
do<00:02:59.850> this<00:03:00.060> you'll<00:03:00.810> need<00:03:00.870> to<00:03:01.140> hit<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:02.010> black

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
do this you'll need to hit the black

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.590 
do this you'll need to hit the black
trigger<00:03:02.730> because<00:03:03.030> we<00:03:03.180> know<00:03:03.300> the<00:03:03.360> silver

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
trigger because we know the silver

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.360 
trigger because we know the silver
trigger<00:03:03.959> controls<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.650> height<00:03:04.800> of<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.160> legs

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
trigger controls the height of the legs

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.480 
trigger controls the height of the legs
so<00:03:06.209> you<00:03:06.630> hit<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.930> black<00:03:07.140> trigger<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:08.250> then

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
so you hit the black trigger and then

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.670 
so you hit the black trigger and then
you<00:03:08.850> can<00:03:09.000> control<00:03:09.390> what<00:03:09.630> angle<00:03:10.170> you<00:03:10.290> actually

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
you can control what angle you actually

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.670 
you can control what angle you actually
want<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.100> legs<00:03:11.340> to<00:03:11.459> be<00:03:11.790> at<00:03:12.170> this<00:03:13.170> is<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.380> great

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
want the legs to be at this is a great

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.190 
want the legs to be at this is a great
tripod<00:03:14.190> feature<00:03:14.520> the<00:03:15.180> ability<00:03:15.270> to<00:03:15.630> get<00:03:15.959> this

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
tripod feature the ability to get this

the neck from a vertical to a horizontal
position<00:03:33.980> let's<00:03:34.980> see<00:03:35.160> how<00:03:35.310> this<00:03:35.459> is<00:03:35.670> done

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
position let's see how this is done

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.930 
position let's see how this is done
first<00:03:36.870> you<00:03:37.260> need<00:03:37.440> to<00:03:37.470> unscrew<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.459> bottom<00:03:38.640> of

I simply screw the bottom back on it's
as<00:04:05.850> simple<00:04:06.030> as<00:04:06.360> that<00:04:06.500> but<00:04:07.500> you<00:04:07.739> need<00:04:07.890> to<00:04:08.070> make

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
as simple as that but you need to make

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.880 
as simple as that but you need to make
sure<00:04:08.280> that<00:04:08.760> once<00:04:09.120> it's<00:04:09.299> screwed<00:04:09.660> back<00:04:09.840> in<00:04:10.049> you
