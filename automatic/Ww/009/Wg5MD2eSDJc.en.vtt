00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.890 

so<00:00:19.650> there's<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:19.980> lot<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.210> elevation<00:00:21.210> changes

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
so there's a lot of elevation changes

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.930 
so there's a lot of elevation changes
now<00:00:22.860> we<00:00:22.920> are<00:00:23.190> approaching<00:00:24.440> turn<00:00:25.440> 1<00:00:25.940> which

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:26.940 
now we are approaching turn 1 which

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.660 
now we are approaching turn 1 which
after<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.869> longest<00:00:28.140> rate<00:00:28.500> on<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.770> track<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.610> a

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
after the longest rate on the track is a

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.810 
after the longest rate on the track is a
very<00:00:30.090> tight<00:00:30.630> hairpin<00:00:31.130> very<00:00:32.130> important<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.669> get

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
very tight hairpin very important to get

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.090 
very tight hairpin very important to get
the<00:00:32.910> line<00:00:33.120> right<00:00:34.760> and<00:00:35.760> then<00:00:36.059> we<00:00:36.239> are<00:00:36.420> facing

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
the line right and then we are facing

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.040 
the line right and then we are facing
-

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
-

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.660 
-
which<00:00:42.050> is<00:00:42.199> very<00:00:42.230> tricky<00:00:42.679> because<00:00:42.920> breaking<00:00:43.550> is

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
which is very tricky because breaking is

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.700 
which is very tricky because breaking is
already<00:00:43.940> a<00:00:44.059> little<00:00:44.210> bit<00:00:44.420> downhill<00:00:44.660> it's<00:00:45.530> off

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
already a little bit downhill it's off

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.520 
already a little bit downhill it's off
camber<00:00:46.190> and<00:00:46.460> it's<00:00:47.269> very<00:00:47.449> easy<00:00:47.510> to<00:00:47.870> lose<00:00:48.469> the

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
camber and it's very easy to lose the

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.619 
camber and it's very easy to lose the
car<00:00:48.829> it's<00:00:49.039> a<00:00:49.129> long<00:00:49.370> corner<00:00:49.640> usually<00:00:50.180> Australia

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
car it's a long corner usually Australia

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.520 
car it's a long corner usually Australia
with<00:00:50.750> front<00:00:51.019> grip<00:00:52.750> into<00:00:53.750> turn<00:00:53.960> three<00:00:54.199> which<00:00:54.500> is

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
with front grip into turn three which is

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.410 
with front grip into turn three which is
a<00:00:54.710> high<00:00:54.890> speed<00:00:54.949> right<00:00:55.609> hand<00:00:55.879> kink

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
a high speed right hand kink

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.069 
a high speed right hand kink
usually<00:00:57.079> very<00:00:57.110> quick

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
usually very quick

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.810 
usually very quick
and<00:00:59.469> then<00:00:59.800> up<00:01:00.010> the<00:01:00.160> hill<00:01:00.340> blind

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
and then up the hill blind

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.439 
and then up the hill blind
down<00:01:02.570> to<00:01:02.750> turn<00:01:02.960> four<00:01:03.760> actually<00:01:04.760> up<00:01:05.089> to<00:01:05.269> turn

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
down to turn four actually up to turn

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.770 
down to turn four actually up to turn
four<00:01:05.830> important<00:01:06.830> to<00:01:06.920> hit<00:01:07.040> the<00:01:07.159> apex<00:01:07.690> carry<00:01:08.690> a

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
four important to hit the apex carry a

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.050 
four important to hit the apex carry a
lot<00:01:08.960> of<00:01:08.990> speed<00:01:09.170> and<00:01:09.830> then<00:01:10.550> we<00:01:10.580> are<00:01:10.820> going

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
lot of speed and then we are going

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.680 
lot of speed and then we are going
straight<00:01:11.330> across<00:01:11.840> the<00:01:12.110> track<00:01:13.300> to<00:01:14.300> going<00:01:14.570> to

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
straight across the track to going to

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.100 
straight across the track to going to
turn<00:01:14.900> five<00:01:15.520> very<00:01:16.520> long<00:01:16.790> corner<00:01:17.240> again<00:01:17.450> easy<00:01:17.810> to

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
turn five very long corner again easy to

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.710 
turn five very long corner again easy to

lose the rear on the exit hard on the
rear<00:01:20.900> tires<00:01:22.570> short<00:01:23.570> straight<00:01:24.550> before<00:01:25.550> braking

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
rear tires short straight before braking

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.710 
rear tires short straight before braking
for<00:01:26.360> the<00:01:26.450> chicane<00:01:27.190> six<00:01:28.190> and<00:01:28.610> seven<00:01:29.119> and<00:01:29.450> this

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
for the chicane six and seven and this

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.420 
for the chicane six and seven and this
is<00:01:29.869> one<00:01:30.050> of<00:01:30.140> my<00:01:30.229> favorite<00:01:30.680> parts<00:01:30.979> on<00:01:31.100> the<00:01:31.190> track

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
is one of my favorite parts on the track

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.219 
is one of my favorite parts on the track
because<00:01:32.210> you<00:01:32.330> really<00:01:32.630> don't<00:01:32.810> have<00:01:32.960> a<00:01:33.020> lot<00:01:33.200> of

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
because you really don't have a lot of

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.029 
because you really don't have a lot of
time<00:01:33.500> to<00:01:33.680> rest

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:36.039 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:38.680 

nice<00:01:37.039> floating<00:01:37.700> corners<00:01:38.060> important<00:01:38.479> to<00:01:38.539> get

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
nice floating corners important to get

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.680 
nice floating corners important to get
the<00:01:38.810> car<00:01:39.050> ride<00:01:40.690> well<00:01:41.690> for<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.050> for<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:42.619> race

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
the car ride well for the for the race

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.290 
the car ride well for the for the race
before<00:01:44.690> we<00:01:44.810> go<00:01:45.070> through<00:01:46.070> this<00:01:46.300> left-hander

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300
