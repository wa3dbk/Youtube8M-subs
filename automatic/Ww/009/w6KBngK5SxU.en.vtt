00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:32.540
 the pd retreats of joy 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.640
 good morning then this is a tutorial 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.890
 obviously for very simple halloween 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.500
 to really make a table 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.000
 at the last minute for all those 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.220
 have not had time to think of a 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.570
 costume all those that have some 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.210
 small imperfection sometimes a little outside 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.280
 with to cover with these with this 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.620
 you can't see anything in the valley 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.600
 obviously inspired by american horror 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:00.839
 story 2 but companies added those 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.879
 they are optional let's say that the thing more 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:06.000
 important is the white base of black 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.600
 to make drops and eyes e 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.710
 obviously you will hear lots closed figo 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.930
 you will be covered with eyes 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.330
 blues a little less so maybe if 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.390
 you really have dark contact 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.010
 take anyway easy to do is 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.750
 fast and certainly scary 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.210
 then if you don't want to be recognized by 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.670
 bridge the slice you don't want the team 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.460
 of the situation I know here not 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:35.180
 will recognize a good halloween 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.920
 ok those are up front 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.890
 hard the prevalent pajamas one of those 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.650
 tricks for those with little time begins 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:49.470
 directly with the white base he uses them 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:52.110
 this gym I create that lanna 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.520
 practically this white that goes 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.380
 dull could talk to 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.380
 water with a fix plus with that 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:03.300
 you want and after having wet I go to 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:09.780
 work the product with a beautiful one 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:11.819
 limit brush to put it to make a 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.069
 first possible genius second one works 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.090
 with the white very often it comes out to 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.410
 Matteo 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.959
 it is important to go slowly and 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.379
 proceed by zones and maybe do two 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.379
 layer 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.220
 and a person shows it to be not 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.220
 recognized to anyone 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:00.470
 as goals you don't have to buy by force 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.270
 this building here to do this 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.370
 lucca 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.990
 that is, you can color the white 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.130
 more classic especially for allo e 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:12.740
 so those are also in that 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.010
 like giants who use children know 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.010
 very well 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.720
 ok then your own pass doing the 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:32.180
 second pass is more homogeneous 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:34.310
 possible with the sponge as much 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:40.549
 brushes often leave them ironed 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:42.319
 way to make stucco more homogeneous 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.450
 ok sometimes you did white not 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.579
 will never be one hundred percent e 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.349
 white and takes impossible to 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:52.430
 make perfect but take the pencil 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:04:01.489
 Black and start then your 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:04:04.849
 eye and with a small brush a 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:08.150
 some small but to put some 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:14.829
 white where there is no pencil and under the 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:17.930
 outline the councilor better from the other 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:23.690
 puts the fight kahn was also in rhyme 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:31.430
 internal and between the lashes so that no 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:37.510
 there is a detachment and then I take a gag a 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:40.200
 liquid start created 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.200
 the drops 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:18.800
 the three kings even above a little more 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:21.110
 gloss the black of the pencil and finally 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.360
 to make it even cooler and look 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.010
 let's take some black glitter question 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:29.750
 of the brand take some glue for 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:34.310
 false eyelashes were to be put under the 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:36.530
 tears we've just drawn and 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.860
 then I took the glitter sini that put them 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.860
 over it 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:52.840
 obviously if we can put it 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:55.870
 also above ok you do the same command 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:06:00.580
 to the other of a bit of mascara I put it 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:06.340
 so that the terms cannot put them 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:08.470
 the scale no we go to put the non 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:11.970
 I never understand how the company is set up for 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.970
 understand how it dresses and parliament 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:18.880
 let's put a little bit of dye even a little more 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.610
 below because as you can see e 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.370
 review some of the col 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:27.030
 so go well what below doesn't have to be 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:32.400
 succeed as above but let's get some 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:32.400
 i hope i liked morello wave
