00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:14.150
 Yes Hi I recently bought a lens 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:19.580
 It may be best to buy a new one in terms of quality and trust, but I personally 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:23.689
 True from that cheap than there is no resistance until there even used article 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.230
 As I said this lens buy directly below now in the purpose 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:31.380
 The muscle is the middle 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:35.579
 I chose the method, so if you don't do the opening video Ueno, it's fine there 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.940
 Roughly as the coin does not do that we will see many 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:44.380
 This time because I used already of the lens 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:54.430
 I would like to introduce you to try using it 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:01:01.690
 Lens bought this time is here 50mm f 1.4 ex dg hsm of sigma 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:04.370
 The model is now Sigma has three lines of model and other qualities 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:11.870
 There is an art line that sticks to the surface 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:20.210
 It is a 50mm f 1.4 lens with a period of one piece before the art line. 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:23.340
 As it is in this product name, hsm ultrasonic motor is built-in and it is quiet and fast 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:28.380
 I am saying 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:33.090
 It is said that such a single focus lens mountain is a problem with a bright lens well 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:38.009
 Do you think that it is the peripheral dimmer that the four corners become dark ? 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:41.549
 It's probably a bit at a store, including the point of resolution 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.330
 Please see here because there is a member 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.890
 Please, the other party is from now 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:50.870
 I little I would like to see the photos in this lens 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:56.210
 It is lightroom to use 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:59.590
 Here are some photos taken on 50mm f 1.4 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:04.990
 Open from here f 1.4 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:11.920
 Here to say all the time to Fu say 1.8 f 22 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:17.890
 The maximum aperture of the lens It is f 16 is not a little juicing until f 22 16 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:23.560
 Until then, this is a photo I took of a liberal teen with open eyes 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.980
 Pinto is anabuki construction it is written me here this Anabuki I of this 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:31.549
 Focus here 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:33.930
 It together this is coming firm best because I combined in each 0 displayed in Live View 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:37.120
 In 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:41.980
 Fingering planning 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:46.060
 All this is a photo of f 1.8 with a slight reduction 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:50.240
 If you look at it like this , I think you do not understand the difference so much 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:56.930
 Well Well after all the focus in the doorway, but it's coming 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:03:03.350
 Well I say anglyma high fever and it is still so much even if I come around 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:05.430
 Now f 1.8 in that but it is not know f because vividly name of 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:09.359

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.010

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:25.950

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.360

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.700
 You're wrong! 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:45.890
 I 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:49.630
 Well here is the center of focus, but although this is also in focus, this tile 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:53.110
 This is good I wonder if say Nazememe 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:56.980
 And Paki' a little feeling that you are doing mode 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:04:02.080

 f 8 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:18.480
 Of Iso work by changing only this same set edge 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:22.049
 I'm taking it at +0.3 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:27.930
 I'm shooting with jpeg but the brightness of this child is 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:29.850
 What I ask them to that there is no there is little this time Well and has changed the brightness of the photo 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.520

 In the person of a problem to use the ne what it'm a matter of preference of the people 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:12.090
 I don't say it at all, but I think if I understand that it's different up to here 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:14.300
 This is 13 if this is Fuchu 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:21.080

 It is- 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:42.430
 Well, a little bit about the sense of resolution and the light reduction around Emma when having it with that it is such a feeling 

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:47.260
 I tried to talk 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:56.260
 There is still a lot of things I want to convey with this lens 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:58.950
 After all the resolution of when the subject is in focus that if in Hano bright f 1 point 4 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:02.700
