00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:20.360
 which is under the pressure of home 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:28.580
 conditions can be used 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:31.580
 many things but i use such stick 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.580
 rope 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:43.340
 nut on the vehicle wheel and Muscovite 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:48.420
 also pliers and screwdrivers 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:52.440
 to open it a lot of mind is not necessary but 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:57.030
 We must remember that this pet tag 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.890
 is under great pressure and to 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.250
 you did not happen like this 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.250
 video clip 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.170
 produce beer 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:30.119
 need through the central valve 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.220
 Bleed through the central valve 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.490
 pressure to this pressure 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.700
 Bleed we use the wheel nut 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:43.250
 like a spacer to push 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.369
 and also the rope with which we do 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.720
 noose 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.759
 I mean lasso dressing load 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.009
 shoots 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:58.110
 after we put on the lasso drinks gu 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:02:02.820
 and put the nut in the middle we take 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.630
 cant stick something like this 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.619
 position 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:13.500
 this stick and reel on it 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:18.840
 the rope after the rope is somewhat 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:21.680
 turns wound we move aside a little 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:26.330
 further off the shelf in order to create 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:31.459
 lever tension and stick up 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:35.720
 fingers the nut begins to push the nut 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.720
 at the same time bleed pressure 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:23.720
 all pressure relieved 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:29.090
 you can remove the rope with a stick and 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:34.370
 a nut this no longer requires us after 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:36.819
 this we take the screwdriver unscrew this 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.819
 self-tapping screw 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.170
 after the screw is unscrewed from the tarik 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:53.250
 we take pliers and break off 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:13.110
 clamps 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:13.110
 Corks them 2 pieces 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.670
 after we broke them off 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:38.040
