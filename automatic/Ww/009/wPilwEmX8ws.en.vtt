00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.320
 hello how about youtube friends well 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.790
 friends because this time we are going to 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.039
 continue with the products sent by 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.189
 the patchwork company and how can 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.279
 observe we have here two posters of his 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.400
 collection to lloyd this is bomber's 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.160
 totally authentic aluminum the truth 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.920
 is that they look very parents and to do what 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.690
 they are not heavy at all the box is 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.680
 It feels quite light as they can 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:41.460
 observe are bombers for iphone 5 and 5 s 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.350
 here we have says for 5 and 5 s and good 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.500
 here in the front part says monkey 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.170
 keep it simple and says not original equipment 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.120
 iphone design just like the others go 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.719
 because they sent us are also extra 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:58.140
 thin since it only measures point 9 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.870
 millimeters thick and good is from a 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.449
 pretty pretty lightweight aluminum 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.610
 we have here in two colors how can 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.820
 observe 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.040
 and in gold the truth is that I liked them 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.650
 very much but good only I'm going to 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.560
 open the silver so let's leave 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:18.890
 this here and we will continue exploring 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:22.520
 the box from the back we're going to 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.470
 check and well we have here in the part 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.930
 from behind it says that it includes a 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.540
 screen protector that is appreciated 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:33.080
 quite since as you know good to be 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.479
 a good bumper is unprotected what 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.479
 is the part of the front and the part of 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.729
 back only covers our sides 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.530
 of the device or what are the 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.450
 shores so the fact that it brings 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.090
 a protective skin for the part of the 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.070
 front and the back is something 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.990
 pretty pretty good and good you know 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.790
 that we have here the hologram of 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.310
 authenticity that will tell us what is 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.540
 a product of this brand we have 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.940
 also some specifications 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.410
 techniques in this part but I think that 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.350
 it is better to place it on the device 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.570
 to see how it is and finally good 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.860
 I want to mention something that is a fact 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:12.680
 Well, what I liked is that this box is not 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.350
 and cardboard is not this plastic if it is not 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.630
 of metal is now so of the same 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.150
 aluminum of which our 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.970
 hype well, I'm going to take it out of 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.280
 camera since I have to place rather 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.560
 I have to remove this part where it comes 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.870
 the protective skin and good is a little 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.720
 more complicated in April since as they 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.030
 I said this is metal and basically this 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.740
 it's a sticker that you have to remove with 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.600
 very careful so good when I 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.820
 have already open return with you 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.730
 Well, I have the bomber here 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.950
 aluminum but I want to show you what 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.680
 there was in the pocket that was in the 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.900
 back that now is the 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:55.989
 instructional so we can see how to place 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:59.060
 both the bomber and the protective string 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.680
 here we have the instructions that always 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.650
 thank you to come in this kind of 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.020
 details and we also have here in this 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.850
 Pocket already knows as in the 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:12.340
 other bomber as they write protective 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:16.500
 both in front and from the part of 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:21.150
 back we have a lint remover 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:23.190
 a microfiber and a spatula only 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.490
 I wanted to mention these details that 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:30.200
 they include us that they are pretty enough 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:33.360
 useful and good, we have the bomber here 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.040
 that looks pretty pretty nice but 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.160
 I think you have to put on the best 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.650
 to the device to see how it is left 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.770
 once put and serially as I told you 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.680
 does not weigh absolutely nothing so good 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:49.170
 I go for my iphone to place I already have 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.610
 here my iphone and well let's put it 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.570
 in the same way that the other one I'm going to 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:56.790
 remove the rubber part as it is 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.220
 exactly like the other bomber 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.920
 It has a rubbery part that makes it 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.340
 flexible obviously this is not flexible 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.620
 because it 's aluminum but this part if 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.980
 it is so it's pretty easy to 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.240
 place it and let's do it I'm 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.520
 putting up 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:19.090
 I already have it there 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.480
 and it's already set so we're going with the 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.480
 other part 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.200
 let's put it on 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.419
 with extreme care both as well 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.040
 as you can see it is already placed 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:35.310
 totally the truth is that it cost me a 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:38.850
 little bit of work to put on since not 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.979
 It is flexible to be metal because it gives a little 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:45.090
 of more work but the truth is that 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:47.550
 it's worth it looks very nice and this 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.190
 It is made of authentic aluminum and in color 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:53.310
 silver good I like how it looks with the 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.770
 black color of the iphone well finally 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.650
 let's explore what the cuts are 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.139
 as you can see here has the 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.270
 buttons I like you have now like this 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:05.550
 as if they were the authentic buttons 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:09.270
 iphone in silver color 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:11.760
 and we have here the opening for what 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.520
 is the blocking of the volume control 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:17.160
 let's go to the part above here and 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.870
 we have the button in silver color the 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.750
 it really looks pretty nice I like it 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:24.449
 that is covered and totally accessible 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.550
 we go to the part of here from the side and 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:29.280
 on this occasion if we have what is the 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.410
 opening for the farm so we're not going 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.920
 to have no problem to get the 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.260
 tape 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:37.230
 when we need it we will share 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.930
 down here and as you can see 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:42.750
 we also have what are the holes 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:45.540
 of the speakers and we have the holes 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:48.510
 to connect our hearing aids and to 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:51.000
 place the charger so we're not going to 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:53.010
 have no problem with access and 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.920
 well something that I quite like is that 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:06:00.000
 is what is this gummy part in color 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:01.740
 white because it makes a kind of edge 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.380
 that will allow us if your 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.510
 device is placed upside down or mouth 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:09.960
 up well, it is scratched because it is 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:12.780
 totally and now yes that protected from 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.250
 any type of fall and also with the 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.130
 protective skin that comes then 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.960
 enough now so protected this 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.810
 part that is free so much in front 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:24.000
 like from the back so nothing 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.650
 friends, I have nothing more to recommend 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.750

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.940

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:32.490
 these bombers that truth stamps from 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.560
 we made and that they are in aluminum 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.730
 authentic because it's something pretty enough 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.830
 original 

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:38.190
 remember that these two colors are 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.520
