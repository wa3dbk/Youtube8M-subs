00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello people of capital i am 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.950
 remco of prose 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.950
 may ask 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.920
 and it's not so much a joke there 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.630
 add something with regard to items 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.670
 but it's just a little tweak in it 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.039
 minecraft you also know the inventory 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.140
 tweaks and some you will like him already 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.050
 probably know as your torturer 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.090
 phoebes and they also played then you can 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.990
 this molt why this just ensures that 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.840
 you your 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.399
 can easily sort items I have now 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.260
 nothing in my inventory but I have 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.690
 here are a few very nice boxes 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.510
 really super nice look at the wood 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.070
 what the ride oh my god so beautiful but 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.460
 look i have a few different here 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.290
 stuff 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.640
 and so i don't really see beautiful 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.760
 organized 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.100
 and if he does then is reasonable on there already 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.260
 shoppie idea you say as your inventory 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.280
 I would sit here but we would 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.309
 a few things 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.559
 we can do this so this way they can be beautiful 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.629
 sketching under each other sometimes it works 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.770
 not completely different then they are not too good 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.899
 belong together 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.360
 yeah we different orth then they go 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.100
 all nicely behind each other 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.110
 And this is just the one that is full of sourcing 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.750
 all sisters we get this is like 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.250
 you put them down and this is 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.570
 if you would pass each other so behind 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.070
 want to put each other and then see how beautiful 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.100
 it is presorting in one go 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.900
 the same here with food very easily 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.909
 and of course with clothes and everything comes 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.439
 nice to stand together yes everything will come 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.630
 just all together blood is for sale 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.579
 all leather are all together 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.320
 like things and otherwise were so fat 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.540
 take it easy all 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.570
 if you're well here also if you 're well here 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.570
 click on this little three dots 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.200
 and then you look at the in vittoria chess 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.720
 settings 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.579
 do you have the type you can sort seg 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.649
 how to make a parent very easy 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.640
 For example, suppose you have a stack with 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:02:00.600
 bread and you eat all bread and you 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.490
 still do n't want bread for a long time and you 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.600
 have happen to you than he fills 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.970
 that just to screw you with this 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.700
 one or by nature dragging bla bla 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.130
 no that this is just the itself 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.980
 vision exactly what it is more options 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:17.130
 So all all be batiste school 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.980
 a super nice one 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.850
 I have to change a lot if you 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.410
 want it yourself 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.960
 I don't because I just do the 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.250
 fool think up am happy with it 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.840
 but this is a man i actually too 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.120
 they teach and we see it at one 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.650
 just to be there today for that minecraft 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.650
 version is not a word you have finished 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.010
 you do not work completely yet everything is 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.750
 your super nice lol and that very and think so 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.910
 I super chill in minecraft because I hate 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.010
 everything from that unorganized jazz to him 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.200
 this is how funny it looks to me 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.300
 just not easy to work 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.560
 so that's why this super super easy 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.420
 to people 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.860
 la there go to the point ok people 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.300
 we have arrived at the point and I 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.470
 no meat mouth 8 and so it seems 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.850
 maybe very high 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.850
 we such a small mouth makes it find it 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.440
 really really a heavy handy just 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.970
 because the 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.150
 yes it just makes minecraft a lot 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.200
 I think it is clearer and it is 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.480
 look i'm not that bad of it 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.670
 adapt to motor skills 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.500
 as installed by the maker 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.930
 I think it's okay but suppose you want 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.040
 really everything sorted to perfection 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.420
 and so on 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:24.900
 then that is possible with this box 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:27.420
 so many custom things about that i kiss one 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.489
 smell that you can customize well so 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.980
 remco nice dutch talk 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.320
 and I find that super easy 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.450
 and yes if you do n't want it then 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.700
 you can also wear such glasses and what I whole 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.830
 nice is that they could not fix through the kon 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.540
 for when going to ask about your conflict 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.100
 story you could do things there 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.870
 no it can be done via minecraft 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.760
