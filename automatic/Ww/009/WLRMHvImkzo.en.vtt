00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.270 
a fullback do you ever think about what
it<00:01:36.840> could<00:01:36.869> mean<00:01:36.990> for<00:01:37.290> your<00:01:37.409> future<00:01:37.680> maybe<00:01:38.130> at

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
it could mean for your future maybe at

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.399 
it could mean for your future maybe at
the<00:01:38.340> next<00:01:38.549> level<00:01:38.700> oh<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.990> mean<00:01:40.140> not<00:01:40.259> really

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
the next level oh I mean not really

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.050 
the next level oh I mean not really
right<00:01:40.619> now<00:01:40.829> just<00:01:41.040> wonder<00:01:41.340> when<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:41.729> bakes<00:01:41.909> a

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
right now just wonder when this bakes a

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.390 
right now just wonder when this bakes a
championship<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.780> mean

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
championship I mean

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.070 
championship I mean
a<00:01:43.930> little<00:01:44.930> bit<00:01:46.240> does<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:47.390> approach<00:01:47.780> of<00:01:47.810> this

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
a little bit does the approach of this

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.720 
a little bit does the approach of this
position<00:01:48.260> suit<00:01:48.800> you<00:01:48.950> more<00:01:49.220> and<00:01:49.340> he<00:01:49.430> said<00:01:49.640> you

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730 
position suit you more and he said you

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.550 
position suit you more and he said you
have<00:01:49.820> fun<00:01:50.030> anything<00:01:50.540> I<00:01:50.810> think<00:01:51.080> so<00:01:51.230> I<00:01:51.260> was

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
have fun anything I think so I was

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.320 
have fun anything I think so I was
always<00:01:51.710> a<00:01:51.980> bigger<00:01:52.340> running<00:01:52.610> back<00:01:52.760> home<00:01:53.120> in<00:01:53.270> the

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
always a bigger running back home in the

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.830 
always a bigger running back home in the
transition<00:01:53.750> wasn't<00:01:54.020> too<00:01:54.890> out<00:01:55.790> of<00:01:55.850> the<00:01:56.030> way<00:01:56.090> so

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
transition wasn't too out of the way so

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.990 
transition wasn't too out of the way so
I<00:01:56.870> think<00:01:56.990> he<00:01:57.230> did<00:01:57.380> adjustable<00:01:58.040> transition<00:01:58.610> was

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
I think he did adjustable transition was

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.880 
I think he did adjustable transition was
it<00:01:59.120> was<00:01:59.270> the<00:01:59.510> whole<00:01:59.660> future<00:02:00.080> thing<00:02:00.110> for<00:02:00.770> you

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
it was the whole future thing for you

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.590 
it was the whole future thing for you
part<00:02:01.460> of<00:02:01.490> the<00:02:01.580> reason<00:02:01.670> why<00:02:04.120> it<00:02:05.120> really<00:02:05.390> was

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
part of the reason why it really was

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.450 
part of the reason why it really was
just<00:02:05.720> I<00:02:05.930> knew<00:02:06.140> I<00:02:06.170> could<00:02:06.350> get<00:02:07.250> a<00:02:07.310> lot<00:02:07.430> more

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
just I knew I could get a lot more

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.070 
just I knew I could get a lot more
playing<00:02:07.760> time<00:02:07.820> I<00:02:08.000> knew<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.300> team<00:02:08.479> I<00:02:08.750> think<00:02:08.810> I

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
playing time I knew the team I think I

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.900 
playing time I knew the team I think I
could<00:02:09.229> help<00:02:09.350> off<00:02:09.740> into<00:02:10.040> the<00:02:10.160> team<00:02:10.340> playing

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
could help off into the team playing

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:11.980 
could help off into the team playing
that<00:02:11.030> position<00:02:11.120> so<00:02:11.540> that's<00:02:11.660> really<00:02:11.720> why<00:02:11.870> I

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
that position so that's really why I

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.300 
that position so that's really why I
made<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:12.260> transition<00:02:12.920> to<00:02:13.100> go<00:02:13.550> back<00:02:15.220> who'd<00:02:16.220> you

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
made the transition to go back who'd you

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.250 
made the transition to go back who'd you
watch<00:02:16.340> film<00:02:17.180> oh<00:02:17.300> he's<00:02:17.720> trying<00:02:17.840> to<00:02:17.990> pick<00:02:18.140> up

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
watch film oh he's trying to pick up

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.420

so it's forgotten but i think is a
horrible<00:02:58.610> position<00:02:58.730> play<00:02:59.209> because<00:02:59.690> it's<00:03:00.110> a

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
horrible position play because it's a

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.870 
horrible position play because it's a
very<00:03:00.230> important<00:03:00.860> decision<00:03:00.920> fell<00:03:01.370> off<00:03:01.519> and<00:03:01.730> so

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880
