00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.710
 Speak , people, this is a little test. 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:10.039
 I did with the engine I can using the 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:12.289
 twitter is that soon here you 

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:13.579
 are you watching this wonderful tape? 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:16.250
 tied to him right? 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:19.519
 I'm doing a good turn for 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.689
 show that you can accurately 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.550
 motor passes right 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.349
 besides precision, this engine has 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.250
 reduction so much that the piauÃ­ is in the 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:27.410
 medium 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.189
 that is to say it has a relation of gears 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.480
 at the tip 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:38.530
 this is the steppe right is based on the chip n 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:43.370
 nl 3,000 03 now not to forget 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:48.500
 which is used to fractionate is not oo 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:50.449
 the motor boxer ln 2003 then people 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.969
 everyone it will trigger the author of 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.590
 possession or the energy of each time I 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.300
 I have four sides, right? 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.129
 I'll give some energy to every 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.730
 one of them said gandini wins so by 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.469
 against 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.850
 but after I explain ink do not know 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.299
 How does the system work? 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:08.990
 I'm going to show only the internet schematic to 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:11.960
 you see connection schema is not 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.170
 More or less, this one is not me either. 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.590
 I picked up the site from the start the link but the 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:24.890
 code is quite simple 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:29.259
 if you observe and I have four 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:35.000
 abcd pins are at each end of the 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:38.390
 I can power motor by 1 to 1 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.799
 yesterday pine the variable speed 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.799
 okay then I hang up then cast b 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.799
 velocity 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:50.689
 I'll call you later then 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:57.079
 turning it off it points to the 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:59.560
 sides and going to make a personal spin is fine. 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:59.560
 simple 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:09.410
 the variables above our engine 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.980
 working here as the wardrobe 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.980
 also 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.900
 hug everyone there said
