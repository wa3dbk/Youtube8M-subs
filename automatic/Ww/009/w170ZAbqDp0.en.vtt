00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.970 

I<00:00:02.570> think<00:00:03.570> the<00:00:03.659> modern<00:00:03.959> combat<00:00:04.200> franchise<00:00:04.710> has

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
I think the modern combat franchise has

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.369 
I think the modern combat franchise has
changed<00:00:05.670> a<00:00:05.759> lot<00:00:05.910> in<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.180> past<00:00:06.359> few<00:00:06.600> years<00:00:06.899> when

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
changed a lot in the past few years when

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.650 
changed a lot in the past few years when
we<00:00:07.529> started<00:00:07.830> modern<00:00:08.160> combat<00:00:08.370> 4<00:00:08.790> we<00:00:09.210> wanted<00:00:09.540> to

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.540 
we started modern combat 4 we wanted to
refresh<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.139> franchise<00:00:10.590> but<00:00:10.830> we<00:00:11.010> also<00:00:11.130> wanted

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
refresh the franchise but we also wanted

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.879

to<00:00:11.610> keep<00:00:11.880> what<00:00:12.269> made<00:00:12.420> it<00:00:12.570> good<00:00:12.750> so<00:00:13.170> we<00:00:13.469> spent<00:00:13.799> a

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
to keep what made it good so we spent a

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.369 
to keep what made it good so we spent a
lot<00:00:14.040> of<00:00:14.070> time<00:00:14.160> our<00:00:14.700> reading<00:00:15.570> and<00:00:15.809> listening<00:00:15.990> to

weapons and we also used a technology

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.150 
weapons and we also used a technology
called<00:00:54.440> craft<00:00:54.829> to<00:00:55.100> create<00:00:55.850> some<00:00:56.090> amazing

we've<00:01:11.270> had<00:01:11.420> it<00:01:11.600> a<00:01:11.690> bunch<00:01:11.810> of<00:01:11.960> features<00:01:12.340> the

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
we've had it a bunch of features the

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.130 
we've had it a bunch of features the
first<00:01:13.580> one<00:01:13.759> is<00:01:13.940> the<00:01:14.090> tactical<00:01:14.720> movement

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
first one is the tactical movement

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.200 
first one is the tactical movement
system<00:01:15.530> this<00:01:16.009> new<00:01:16.220> system<00:01:16.460> allows<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:17.060> player

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
to move around in the environment very

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.050 
to move around in the environment very
easily<00:01:19.399> it<00:01:19.880> kind<00:01:20.300> of<00:01:20.330> unleashes<00:01:21.020> all<00:01:21.259> the

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
easily it kind of unleashes all the

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.210 
easily it kind of unleashes all the
frantic<00:01:23.060> action<00:01:23.300> that<00:01:23.600> we<00:01:23.720> wanted<00:01:24.050> to<00:01:24.100> to<00:01:25.100> get

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
frantic action that we wanted to to get

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.770 
frantic action that we wanted to to get
to<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:25.490> player<00:01:25.700> during<00:01:26.060> a<00:01:26.210> multiplayer<00:01:26.659> or

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
to the player during a multiplayer or

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.069 
to the player during a multiplayer or
single<00:01:27.229> player<00:01:27.380> campaign<00:01:27.799> we<00:01:28.399> try<00:01:28.909> to<00:01:29.689> create

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
single player campaign we try to create

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.770 
single player campaign we try to create
a<00:01:30.759> big<00:01:31.759> war<00:01:32.119> feeling<00:01:32.689> open<00:01:33.470> space<00:01:33.829> a

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
a big war feeling open space a

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.480 
a big war feeling open space a
large-scale<00:01:35.780> firefight<00:01:36.470> so<00:01:36.950> there's<00:01:37.159> always

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
large-scale firefight so there's always

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.459 
large-scale firefight so there's always
something<00:01:37.909> happening<00:01:38.240> on<00:01:38.659> screen<00:01:38.840> so

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:39.469 
something happening on screen so

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:41.740 
something happening on screen so
basically<00:01:39.860> you're<00:01:40.430> part<00:01:40.729> of<00:01:40.850> something<00:01:41.420> much

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
basically you're part of something much

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.080 
basically you're part of something much
bigger<00:01:41.810> I<00:01:42.350> think<00:01:42.469> the<00:01:42.860> gap<00:01:43.040> between<00:01:43.310> phones

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
bigger I think the gap between phones

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.690 
bigger I think the gap between phones
tablets<00:01:44.750> and<00:01:45.020> console<00:01:45.439> is<00:01:45.710> getting<00:01:46.219> smaller

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
tablets and console is getting smaller

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.929 
tablets and console is getting smaller
every<00:01:47.149> day<00:01:47.299> we<00:01:47.750> strive<00:01:48.439> to<00:01:48.799> do<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.340> best<00:01:49.579> the
