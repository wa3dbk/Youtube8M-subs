00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.450
 I have four famous fish pedal here 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.269
 next to me succeed as lord select the 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.440
 classic an already 8 plus from an expert 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.000
 followed by the f at5 the cask of forest 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.619
 then get that hf1 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.140
 that is a publication of the well-known 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.029
 plus 5 that are known by jimmy 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.800
 hendrix of course and then we close 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.599
 get rid of me soon 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.220
 electro harmonix 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.989
 what I especially do both is movie 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.270
 you really let the make the difference 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.160
 listen they do different pay 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.720
 watch a bottle of buddha's bottle over it 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.030
 Overall very operate all moves 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.980
 usually in a volume button and a game 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.620
 button so there the gods start to differ 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.449
 not sit in and love to cook two riffs 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.890
 one of you played a whole for you 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:51.899
 low mileage 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.410
 and a job and what fierce I sustain 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:58.440
 by the way, play about a mood t-model 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.510
 direct and fender chip as much meat 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.510
 and my pinus enters as follows 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.009
 together with the nx very classic angel advice 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.470
 Oh 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.680
 briefly comforting the forest for her 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.680
 processing open days no stand 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.780
 the hendriks coast cutter 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.370
 and to close the stream 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.660
 I will give you the pay or leave 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.670
 hearing on being hiring can put game 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.520
 very handy if you have some loose 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.900
 notes to play more on those lines 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.580
 on the other hand, both layers 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.310
 knowledge then it can be very nice with 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.210
 it also heard on come and have a look 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.210
 how demo says ribbon 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.030
 then turbo's efset 5 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.849
 long 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.310
 and the fresh face 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:01.120
 and to conclude the deck 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.120
 me on a high back and seat 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:28.960
 we have all these 4 fresh pedals 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:31.419
 can hear what I notice in terms of 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.940
 Sound that we m I say of himself 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.770
 which is clearer in character 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.660
 the forests and casks on the other hand 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.009
 its a bit darker more vintage 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.130
 approach of 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:43.840
 the found the big move is also free 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.610
 dark but i especially much more game than 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.020
 the other company strikes me in that regard 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.120
 opportunities 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.190
 ill that at the big stale they have one 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.110
 shows button mounted double saying that 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.160
 I still a pretty dull one style free 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.620
 the other can go together 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.590
 that's just the case with frustration 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.690
 this was a knee in the 50s 60s 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.770
 you can see the boosters clearly and three 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.720
 position schuts 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.160
 where you can choose between three 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.949
 different types of sister's squatters 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.050
 Approach I think sometimes I say 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:12.669
 however, is again tied a box 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.900
 can be very handy when one 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.300
 example plays with a true one 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:19.360
 giving you a lot of 5 and your pedals 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.039
 magnify four different fish 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.970
 different but all usable one 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:24.720
 certain situation 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.720
 the choice is yours 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.260
 No
