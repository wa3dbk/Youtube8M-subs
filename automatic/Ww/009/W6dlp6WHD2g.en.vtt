what's going on unfortunately I'm not
obviously<00:00:40.320> releasing<00:00:40.950> this<00:00:41.070> planet<00:00:41.370> today

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
obviously releasing this planet today

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.369 
obviously releasing this planet today
because<00:00:41.940> there's<00:00:42.300> some<00:00:42.870> very<00:00:43.020> interesting

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
because there's some very interesting

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.779 
because there's some very interesting
problem<00:00:43.950> with<00:00:44.040> space<00:00:44.190> alien<00:00:44.460> ears<00:00:44.579> at<00:00:44.730> the

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
problem with space alien ears at the

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.340 
problem with space alien ears at the
moment<00:00:45.000> whereby<00:00:45.300> if<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:45.960> have<00:00:46.050> lots<00:00:46.260> of

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
moment whereby if you have lots of

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.250 
moment whereby if you have lots of
asteroids<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.070> then<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.550> turn<00:00:47.820> on<00:00:48.090> oxygen<00:00:48.629> it

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
asteroids and then you turn on oxygen it

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.990 
asteroids and then you turn on oxygen it
reduces<00:00:49.739> your<00:00:49.920> simulation<00:00:50.430> speed<00:00:50.640> down<00:00:50.850> to

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
reduces your simulation speed down to

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.510 
reduces your simulation speed down to
like<00:00:51.120> point2<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.469> took<00:00:52.680> me<00:00:52.890> most<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.430> the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
like point2 and it took me most of the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.189 
like point2 and it took me most of the
day<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.730> work<00:00:54.090> out<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.780> was<00:00:54.960> what<00:00:55.110> was

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
day to work out that that was what was

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.319 
day to work out that that was what was
causing<00:00:55.410> my<00:00:55.770> huge<00:00:56.280> huge<00:00:56.579> huge<00:00:56.760> lag<00:00:57.090> so

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
causing my huge huge huge lag so

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.970 
causing my huge huge huge lag so
unfortunately<00:00:57.930> it's<00:00:58.140> not<00:00:58.199> quite<00:00:58.559> done<00:00:58.739> and

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
unfortunately it's not quite done and

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.319 
unfortunately it's not quite done and
the<00:00:59.250> plan<00:00:59.430> now<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.670> I'm<00:00:59.940> going<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.120> release

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
the plan now is I'm going to release

hopefully a pretty cool map the point of

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.420 
hopefully a pretty cool map the point of

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
little bit about what's going to happen

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.660

want to look at them all at once so that

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.210 
want to look at them all at once so that
it's<00:01:18.000> kind<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.299> clean<00:01:18.810> test<00:01:19.110> bed<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:19.860> my<00:01:19.979> plan

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
so it's going to take you quite a bit of

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.910 
so it's going to take you quite a bit of
time<00:02:13.270> to<00:02:13.360> go<00:02:13.450> through<00:02:13.480> that<00:02:13.690> there<00:02:13.990> might<00:02:14.230> be<00:02:14.290> a

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
time to go through that there might be a

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.800 
time to go through that there might be a
lapse<00:02:15.610> a<00:02:15.820> little<00:02:16.030> bit<00:02:16.150> in<00:02:16.240> the<00:02:16.330> amount<00:02:16.570> of

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
lapse a little bit in the amount of

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.330 
lapse a little bit in the amount of
space<00:02:17.020> engineers<00:02:17.500> content<00:02:17.890> I'm<00:02:17.980> putting<00:02:18.250> out

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
space engineers content I'm putting out

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.710 
space engineers content I'm putting out
on<00:02:18.490> the<00:02:18.550> channel<00:02:18.820> I'll<00:02:18.910> probably<00:02:19.090> go<00:02:19.360> down<00:02:19.510> to

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
on the channel I'll probably go down to

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.420 
on the channel I'll probably go down to
one<00:02:19.900> a<00:02:19.930> week<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:20.440> then<00:02:20.500> that<00:02:21.040> other<00:02:21.220> video
