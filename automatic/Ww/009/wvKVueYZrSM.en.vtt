00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.619 

the<00:00:04.500> great<00:00:04.890> thing<00:00:05.100> about<00:00:05.160> prefab<00:00:06.000> is<00:00:06.270> the

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
the great thing about prefab is the

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.650 
the great thing about prefab is the
processes<00:00:07.319> one<00:00:07.529> where<00:00:07.950> we<00:00:08.510> build<00:00:09.510> the

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
processes one where we build the

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.990 
processes one where we build the
foundations<00:00:10.349> on<00:00:10.559> site<00:00:10.950> which<00:00:11.309> generally<00:00:11.849> on<00:00:11.969> a

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
foundations on site which generally on a

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.970 
foundations on site which generally on a
flat<00:00:12.269> site<00:00:12.570> like<00:00:12.809> this<00:00:12.840> takes<00:00:13.320> about<00:00:13.530> two<00:00:13.769> and

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
flat site like this takes about two and

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.220 
flat site like this takes about two and
a<00:00:14.040> half<00:00:14.099> months<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.730> while<00:00:15.630> we're<00:00:15.900> building

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
a half months and while we're building

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.439 
a half months and while we're building
the<00:00:16.320> foundations<00:00:16.949> at<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.640> exact<00:00:18.000> same<00:00:18.210> time

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
the foundations at the exact same time

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.210 
the foundations at the exact same time
we're<00:00:18.750> building<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.199> house<00:00:19.350> in<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.710> bathroom

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
we're building the house in the bathroom

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.390 
we're building the house in the bathroom
and<00:00:20.460> so<00:00:21.029> it<00:00:21.119> really<00:00:21.330> all<00:00:21.539> culminates<00:00:22.289> with<00:00:22.560> the

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
and so it really all culminates with the

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.140 
and so it really all culminates with the
one<00:00:23.760> or<00:00:23.910> two<00:00:23.939> days<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.830> setting<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.789> house

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
one or two days of setting of the house

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.259 
one or two days of setting of the house
itself<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:28.710> modules<00:00:29.310> are<00:00:29.460> lifted<00:00:29.910> into<00:00:30.090> place

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
itself the modules are lifted into place

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.280 
itself the modules are lifted into place
by<00:00:31.050> large<00:00:31.380> crane<00:00:31.890> they're<00:00:32.610> generally<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.870> a

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
by large crane they're generally of a

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.780 
by large crane they're generally of a
weight<00:00:34.559> between<00:00:34.950> about<00:00:35.309> 30,000<00:00:36.270> pounds<00:00:36.809> and

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
weight between about 30,000 pounds and

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.690 
weight between about 30,000 pounds and
70,000<00:00:38.790> pounds<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:40.620> really<00:00:41.129> then<00:00:41.340> be<00:00:41.489> just

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
70,000 pounds and it really then be just

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.840 
70,000 pounds and it really then be just
becomes<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.180> series<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.600> blocks<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.829> we<00:00:44.520> put

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
becomes a series of blocks that we put

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.450 
becomes a series of blocks that we put
together<00:00:45.030> in<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.840> way<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.079> meets<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.950> program

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
together in a way that meets the program

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.330 
together in a way that meets the program
works<00:00:47.730> for<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.090> site<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:49.100> beautiful<00:00:50.100> to

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
works for the site and is beautiful to

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.040 
works for the site and is beautiful to
us<00:00:50.430> as<00:00:50.670> architecture

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.500 

they<00:00:55.620> really<00:00:56.070> have<00:00:56.309> developed<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:57.000> beautiful

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
they really have developed a beautiful

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.470 
they really have developed a beautiful
rhythm<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:58.620> how<00:00:58.800> they<00:00:59.070> set<00:00:59.460> into<00:01:00.000> how<00:01:00.210> this

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
rhythm to how they set into how this

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.200 
rhythm to how they set into how this
balance<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.559> achieved<00:01:01.710> as<00:01:02.280> they<00:01:02.489> locate<00:01:03.030> this

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
balance is achieved as they locate this

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.020 
balance is achieved as they locate this
very<00:01:03.629> very<00:01:03.870> heavy<00:01:04.110> object<00:01:04.739> very<00:01:05.309> careful

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.640 

we're<00:01:11.030> truly<00:01:11.360> in<00:01:11.660> a<00:01:11.780> los<00:01:11.990> angeles<00:01:12.470> community

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
we're truly in a los angeles community

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.130 
we're truly in a los angeles community
we<00:01:13.160> have<00:01:13.280> homes<00:01:13.550> to<00:01:13.670> both<00:01:13.910> sides<00:01:14.210> we<00:01:14.990> have<00:01:15.110> a

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
we have homes to both sides we have a

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.280 
we have homes to both sides we have a
narrow<00:01:15.560> lot<00:01:15.980> and<00:01:16.430> so<00:01:17.180> we're<00:01:17.420> working<00:01:17.450> with<00:01:17.990> all

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.600 
narrow lot and so we're working with all
the<00:01:18.590> elements<00:01:18.890> that<00:01:19.190> come<00:01:19.400> with<00:01:19.670> urban<00:01:20.060> living

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
the elements that come with urban living

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.130 
the elements that come with urban living
yesterday<00:01:22.610> we<00:01:22.760> set<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:23.240> first<00:01:23.510> floor<00:01:23.810> of<00:01:23.870> the

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
yesterday we set the first floor of the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.020 
yesterday we set the first floor of the
house<00:01:24.320> the<00:01:24.770> modules<00:01:25.220> that<00:01:25.280> comprise<00:01:25.820> the

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
house the modules that comprise the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.140 
house the modules that comprise the
first<00:01:26.270> floor<00:01:26.510> and<00:01:26.780> today<00:01:27.310> the<00:01:28.310> upper<00:01:28.790> level

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
first floor and today the upper level

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.390 
first floor and today the upper level
and<00:01:29.330> there<00:01:29.630> now<00:01:29.840> bolting<00:01:30.560> all<00:01:30.710> those<00:01:30.920> parts

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
and there now bolting all those parts

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.150 
and there now bolting all those parts
together<00:01:32.200> leveling<00:01:33.200> things<00:01:33.530> and<00:01:33.890> then

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
together leveling things and then

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.910 
together leveling things and then
tomorrow<00:01:34.700> our<00:01:35.150> finished<00:01:36.080> crew<00:01:36.290> will<00:01:36.500> come<00:01:36.710> in

and sort of button up the joints between

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:41.920 
and sort of button up the joints between
the<00:01:40.370> modules<00:01:40.880> which<00:01:41.090> will<00:01:41.270> take<00:01:41.420> about<00:01:41.479> five

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
the modules which will take about five

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.570 
the modules which will take about five
or<00:01:42.140> six<00:01:42.290> weeks<00:01:42.590> and<00:01:42.920> then<00:01:43.009> the<00:01:43.130> house<00:01:43.280> will<00:01:43.460> be

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
or six weeks and then the house will be

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.100 
or six weeks and then the house will be
complete<00:01:44.650> so<00:01:45.650> this<00:01:45.860> is<00:01:45.890> a<00:01:46.130> section<00:01:46.820> where<00:01:47.030> the

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
complete so this is a section where the

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.730 
complete so this is a section where the
kitchen<00:01:48.110> opens<00:01:48.800> up<00:01:49.130> to<00:01:49.910> a<00:01:50.330> skylight<00:01:51.050> above<00:01:51.200> and

the scare well behind reduce guys are

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.240 
the scare well behind reduce guys are
standing<00:01:54.170> and<00:01:54.950> we<00:01:55.070> can<00:01:55.280> walk<00:01:56.090> on<00:01:56.119> up<00:01:56.390> that<00:01:56.869> way

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
standing and we can walk on up that way

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.600 
standing and we can walk on up that way
this<00:01:58.250> is<00:01:58.460> the<00:01:58.610> master<00:01:58.790> bedroom<00:02:00.490> there's<00:02:01.490> a

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
this is the master bedroom there's a

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.960 
this is the master bedroom there's a
headboard<00:02:02.360> that's<00:02:02.750> placed<00:02:03.050> here<00:02:03.700> and<00:02:04.700> then

headboard that's placed here and then
the<00:02:05.180> bed<00:02:05.450> will<00:02:05.720> sit<00:02:06.080> out<00:02:06.350> from<00:02:06.710> this<00:02:06.920> the

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
the bed will sit out from this the

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.790 
the bed will sit out from this the
fluorine<00:02:08.119> actually<00:02:08.869> is<00:02:10.060> complete<00:02:11.060> up<00:02:11.660> to<00:02:12.500> the

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
fluorine actually is complete up to the

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.270 
fluorine actually is complete up to the
up<00:02:13.250> to<00:02:13.640> about<00:02:13.940> a<00:02:14.209> foot<00:02:14.660> away<00:02:14.870> from<00:02:15.200> where<00:02:16.130> the

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
up to about a foot away from where the

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.240 
up to about a foot away from where the
two<00:02:16.489> modules<00:02:16.760> connect<00:02:17.480> so<00:02:18.260> now<00:02:18.440> in<00:02:18.769> the<00:02:18.890> coming

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
two modules connect so now in the coming

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.220 
two modules connect so now in the coming
weeks<00:02:19.430> they'll<00:02:19.730> go<00:02:19.880> ahead<00:02:20.209> and<00:02:20.390> fill<00:02:20.690> that<00:02:20.720> gap

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
weeks they'll go ahead and fill that gap

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.770 
weeks they'll go ahead and fill that gap
