two gigahertz and basically what I'm
going<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.079> do<00:01:31.350> I'm<00:01:31.560> going<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.860> go<00:01:32.070> through<00:01:32.280> the

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
going to do I'm going to go through the

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.080 
going to do I'm going to go through the
CPU<00:01:32.970> shortly<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:35.340> socket<00:01:35.700> we're<00:01:35.850> going<00:01:36.000> to

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
CPU shortly the socket we're going to

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.770 
CPU shortly the socket we're going to
use<00:01:36.180> here<00:01:36.479> it's<00:01:36.750> LJ<00:01:37.369> w150<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.329> can<00:01:39.600> see

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
use here it's LJ w150 so you can see

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.499 
use here it's LJ w150 so you can see
here<00:01:40.049> we<00:01:40.290> have<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.950> 2<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.939> pci<00:01:43.250> slots<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.549> we<00:01:45.329> have

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
here we have a 2 a pci slots and we have

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.639 
here we have a 2 a pci slots and we have
two<00:01:45.720> pci<00:01:46.079> express<00:01:46.590> three<00:01:46.950> spots<00:01:47.729> here<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.270> two

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
two pci express three spots here and two

pci express one slots and you can see

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.060 
pci express one slots and you can see
basically<00:01:53.840> it's<00:01:54.840> written<00:01:55.110> there<00:01:55.439> it's<00:01:55.799> very

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
basically it's written there it's very

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.380 
basically it's written there it's very
easy<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:57.530> define<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.829> we<00:01:59.610> have<00:01:59.820> four<00:02:00.060> slots

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
easy to define and we have four slots

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.660 
easy to define and we have four slots
for<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:01.439> memory<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.579> this<00:02:03.270> can<00:02:03.540> support<00:02:04.049> up<00:02:04.439> to

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
for the memory so this can support up to

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.310 
for the memory so this can support up to
32<00:02:05.670> gig<00:02:05.909> in<00:02:06.180> our<00:02:06.420> case<00:02:06.750> we're<00:02:06.960> going<00:02:07.170> to

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
32 gig in our case we're going to

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.950 
32 gig in our case we're going to
install<00:02:07.469> 16<00:02:08.099> gig<00:02:08.310> dual<00:02:08.550> channel

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
install 16 gig dual channel

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.540 
install 16 gig dual channel
and<00:02:10.050> we<00:02:10.740> have<00:02:11.010> as<00:02:11.370> well<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:12.750> seta<00:02:13.050> a

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
and we have as well the seta a

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.830 
and we have as well the seta a
connection<00:02:14.550> you<00:02:14.670> can<00:02:14.880> see<00:02:15.060> here<00:02:15.300> six<00:02:15.660> Sokka

connection you can see here six Sokka
they<00:02:18.840> are<00:02:19.020> basically<00:02:19.370> six<00:02:20.370> gb<00:02:20.610> SATA<00:02:21.680> i'm<00:02:22.680> going

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
they are basically six gb SATA i'm going

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.400 
they are basically six gb SATA i'm going
to<00:02:23.160> use<00:02:23.310> a<00:02:23.670> 3<00:02:24.000> terabyte<00:02:24.480> hard<00:02:24.840> drive<00:02:25.200> to

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
to use a 3 terabyte hard drive to

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.390 
to use a 3 terabyte hard drive to
connect<00:02:25.770> to<00:02:26.390> this<00:02:27.390> one<00:02:28.200> of<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.500> SATA<00:02:28.740> port<00:02:29.130> and

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
connect to this one of the SATA port and

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.800 
connect to this one of the SATA port and
the<00:02:29.940> other<00:02:30.030> one<00:02:30.360> we're<00:02:30.600> going<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:30.870> use<00:02:31.050> for<00:02:31.620> DVD

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
the other one we're going to use for DVD

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.560 
the other one we're going to use for DVD
that's<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.960> hard<00:02:34.170> drive<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.770> 3<00:02:35.040> terabyte<00:02:35.570> so

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
that's the hard drive the 3 terabyte so

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.600 
that's the hard drive the 3 terabyte so
i'm<00:02:36.630> going<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:36.960> divide<00:02:37.230> this<00:02:37.710> to<00:02:38.220> three

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
i'm going to divide this to three

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.750 
i'm going to divide this to three
partitions<00:02:39.240> C<00:02:40.080> D<00:02:40.380> and<00:02:40.410> E<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:41.040> each<00:02:41.190> one<00:02:41.460> want

partitions C D and E and each one want

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.390 
partitions C D and E and each one want
to<00:02:41.880> buy<00:02:42.150> you<00:02:42.960> can<00:02:43.140> do<00:02:43.320> whatever<00:02:43.530> partitions

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
to buy you can do whatever partitions

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.170 
to buy you can do whatever partitions
you<00:02:44.550> like<00:02:45.530> it<00:02:46.530> depends<00:02:47.070> on<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.460> way<00:02:47.610> how<00:02:48.120> you

basically<00:03:29.150> this<00:03:29.300> one<00:03:30.069> so<00:03:31.069> we<00:03:31.250> have<00:03:31.459> one<00:03:31.700> and<00:03:31.940> if

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
basically this one so we have one and if

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:33.790 
basically this one so we have one and if
you<00:03:32.330> have<00:03:32.510> another<00:03:32.810> one<00:03:33.080> you<00:03:33.200> can<00:03:33.230> install

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
you have another one you can install

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:40.750 
you have another one you can install
here<00:03:34.069> but<00:03:34.370> in<00:03:34.520> our<00:03:34.640> case<00:03:34.730> I<00:03:35.709> have<00:03:36.709> only<00:03:36.920> one<00:03:39.760> as

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
here but in our case I have only one as

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.110 
here but in our case I have only one as
usual<00:03:41.450> you<00:03:41.780> have<00:03:41.810> the<00:03:42.800> gigabyte<00:03:43.280> manual<00:03:43.820> and

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
usual you have the gigabyte manual and

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.920 
usual you have the gigabyte manual and
software<00:03:44.720> drivers<00:03:45.610> and<00:03:46.610> that's<00:03:46.970> the<00:03:47.300> video

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
software drivers and that's the video

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.660 
software drivers and that's the video
card<00:03:48.170> I<00:03:49.270> did<00:03:50.270> before<00:03:50.830> installation<00:03:51.830> for<00:03:52.640> the

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
card I did before installation for the

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.140 
card I did before installation for the
video<00:03:53.300> card<00:03:53.650> same<00:03:54.650> video<00:03:55.010> card<00:03:55.280> into<00:03:55.760> another

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
video card same video card into another

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:04.090 
video card same video card into another
system<00:03:56.739> and<00:03:57.739> you<00:03:58.160> can<00:03:58.370> look<00:03:58.520> to<00:03:58.880> the<00:03:59.800> link<00:04:03.100> so

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
system and you can look to the link so

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.470 
system and you can look to the link so
that's<00:04:04.310> the<00:04:04.430> video<00:04:04.760> card<00:04:06.940> and<00:04:07.940> you<00:04:08.030> can<00:04:08.090> see

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
that's the video card and you can see

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.820 
that's the video card and you can see
the<00:04:08.660> heat<00:04:08.870> pipes<00:04:09.280> the<00:04:10.280> fan<00:04:10.550> and<00:04:11.350> i<00:04:12.350> have<00:04:12.590> many

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
the heat pipes the fan and i have many

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.790 
the heat pipes the fan and i have many
people<00:04:13.190> ask<00:04:13.430> me<00:04:13.640> about<00:04:13.760> the<00:04:14.360> power<00:04:15.200> plug<00:04:15.560> the

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
people ask me about the power plug the

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.940 
people ask me about the power plug the
six<00:04:16.010> pins<00:04:16.280> yes<00:04:17.000> you<00:04:17.419> have<00:04:17.660> to<00:04:17.870> plug<00:04:18.530> this<00:04:18.709> to

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
six pins yes you have to plug this to

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:24.210 
six pins yes you have to plug this to
your<00:04:19.100> power<00:04:19.400> supply<00:04:20.140> so<00:04:21.140> as<00:04:21.769> far<00:04:21.829> as<00:04:22.100> the

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
your power supply so as far as the

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.770 
your power supply so as far as the
connection<00:04:25.220> you<00:04:25.820> can<00:04:26.000> see<00:04:26.210> you<00:04:26.360> have<00:04:26.540> to<00:04:26.780> DVI

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
connection you can see you have to DVI

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:35.770 
connection you can see you have to DVI
hdmi<00:04:29.780> and<00:04:31.060> vga<00:04:32.500> so<00:04:33.500> you<00:04:33.560> have<00:04:34.060> four<00:04:35.060> output

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
hdmi and vga so you have four output

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.710 
hdmi and vga so you have four output
here<00:04:36.080> in<00:04:36.410> this<00:04:36.560> case<00:04:37.000> and<00:04:38.000> basically<00:04:38.390> you<00:04:38.660> just

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
here in this case and basically you just

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:49.320 
here in this case and basically you just
take<00:04:39.110> this<00:04:39.290> out<00:04:42.910> so<00:04:43.910> you<00:04:43.970> can<00:04:44.210> see<00:04:44.419> more<00:04:44.780> clear

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.940 

now<00:04:50.330> other<00:04:50.570> things<00:04:50.930> he<00:04:51.080> comes<00:04:51.350> in<00:04:51.590> the<00:04:51.770> booth

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
now other things he comes in the booth

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:58.300 
now other things he comes in the booth
level<00:04:53.410> so<00:04:54.410> that's<00:04:54.830> the<00:04:55.930> six<00:04:56.930> pin<00:04:57.200> power<00:04:57.560> so<00:04:58.010> if

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
level so that's the six pin power so if

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.950 
level so that's the six pin power so if
your<00:04:58.490> power<00:04:58.760> supply<00:04:59.000> doesn't<00:04:59.450> have<00:04:59.720> this

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
your power supply doesn't have this

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.250 
your power supply doesn't have this
extra<00:05:00.889> you<00:05:01.580> can<00:05:01.639> use<00:05:01.970> this<00:05:02.180> to<00:05:02.240> connect<00:05:02.960> to<00:05:03.110> the

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
extra you can use this to connect to the

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:09.159 
extra you can use this to connect to the
power<00:05:06.669> this<00:05:07.669> is<00:05:07.850> the<00:05:07.970> system<00:05:08.360> is<00:05:08.510> installed<00:05:08.840> as

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
power this is the system is installed as
