attack when it's done like that so I

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.670 
attack when it's done like that so I
think<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.750> could<00:01:39.930> cover<00:01:40.110> those<00:01:40.320> together<00:01:40.470> of

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
think you could cover those together of

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.190 
think you could cover those together of
course<00:01:40.829> it's<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.040> level<00:01:41.250> seven<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:42.020> you<00:01:43.020> could

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
course it's a level seven and you could

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.840 
course it's a level seven and you could
bring<00:01:43.290> out<00:01:43.500> both<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.860> these<00:01:43.950> demos<00:01:44.369> every<00:01:44.610> talk

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
bring out both of these demos every talk

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:45.620 
bring out both of these demos every talk
about<00:01:45.000> like<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.299> but<00:01:45.420> that's<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.570> only

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
about like that but that's the only

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.819 
about like that but that's the only
combo<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.110> can<00:01:46.229> think<00:01:46.380> about<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.560> top<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.770> my

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
combo I can think about the top of my

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.289 
combo I can think about the top of my
head<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.250> would<00:01:47.610> be<00:01:47.670> an<00:01:47.790> easy<00:01:47.939> way<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.119> bring

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
head that would be an easy way to bring

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.660 
head that would be an easy way to bring
up<00:01:48.420> unless<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.750> use<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.350> gagaga<00:01:49.950> magician<00:01:50.520> and

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
up unless you use a gagaga magician and

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.490 
up unless you use a gagaga magician and
got<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.939> girl<00:01:51.240> that's<00:01:51.600> another<00:01:51.810> combo<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.320> can

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
got a girl that's another combo I can

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.350 
got a girl that's another combo I can
think<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.770> really<00:01:53.399> though<00:01:53.610> there's<00:01:54.119> not<00:01:54.329> a

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
think of really though there's not a

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.680 
think of really though there's not a
whole<00:01:54.689> lot<00:01:54.810> of<00:01:54.840> easy<00:01:55.200> calm

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
whole lot of easy calm

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.480 
whole lot of easy calm
for<00:01:55.930> this<00:01:56.020> yet<00:01:56.440> hopefully<00:01:57.010> the<00:01:57.130> future<00:01:57.250> will

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
for this yet hopefully the future will

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.090 
for this yet hopefully the future will
see<00:01:57.640> more<00:01:57.820> but<00:01:58.480> it's<00:01:59.380> an<00:01:59.500> interesting<00:01:59.830> card

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
see more but it's an interesting card

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.230 
see more but it's an interesting card
where<00:02:00.310> you<00:02:00.370> can<00:02:00.490> take<00:02:00.610> off<00:02:00.700> your<00:02:00.790> opponent's

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
where you can take off your opponent's

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.210 
where you can take off your opponent's
monsters<00:02:01.690> that's<00:02:01.930> kind<00:02:02.380> of<00:02:02.440> a<00:02:02.500> neat<00:02:02.650> idea<00:02:02.800> it

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
monsters that's kind of a neat idea it

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.590 
monsters that's kind of a neat idea it
can't<00:02:03.460> attack<00:02:03.730> but<00:02:03.910> I<00:02:03.940> guess<00:02:04.090> your<00:02:04.330> opponent's

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
can't attack but I guess your opponent's

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.690 
can't attack but I guess your opponent's
monster<00:02:04.990> you<00:02:05.470> take<00:02:05.530> it<00:02:05.770> over<00:02:05.860> can<00:02:06.190> I<00:02:06.400> could<00:02:06.610> see

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
monster you take it over can I could see

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.100 
monster you take it over can I could see
this<00:02:06.790> coming<00:02:06.850> in<00:02:07.210> handy<00:02:07.330> gets<00:02:07.660> heroics

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
this coming in handy gets heroics

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.390 
this coming in handy gets heroics
because<00:02:08.410> they<00:02:08.560> can<00:02:08.680> power<00:02:08.860> themselves<00:02:09.040> up

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:09.400 
because they can power themselves up

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.070 
because they can power themselves up
take<00:02:10.030> away<00:02:10.180> one<00:02:10.360> of<00:02:10.450> the<00:02:10.510> powered<00:02:10.720> up<00:02:10.810> monsters

looks<00:04:09.180> like<00:04:09.330> it'd<00:04:09.450> be<00:04:09.600> the<00:04:09.690> most<00:04:09.720> fun<00:04:10.050> to<00:04:10.200> use

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
looks like it'd be the most fun to use

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.410 
looks like it'd be the most fun to use
its<00:04:10.680> effects<00:04:10.920> are<00:04:11.100> very<00:04:11.400> powerful<00:04:11.640> but<00:04:12.360> you

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
its effects are very powerful but you

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.600 
its effects are very powerful but you
have<00:04:12.690> to<00:04:12.870> get<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:13.380> right<00:04:13.530> dice<00:04:13.770> roll<00:04:14.070> you<00:04:14.550> can

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
have to get the right dice roll you can

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:15.950 
have to get the right dice roll you can
use<00:04:14.790> other<00:04:14.910> cards<00:04:15.240> to<00:04:15.360> help<00:04:15.510> with<00:04:15.600> dice<00:04:15.720> rolls

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:15.960 
use other cards to help with dice rolls

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.360 
use other cards to help with dice rolls
cuz<00:04:16.109> we<00:04:16.230> have<00:04:16.380> I<00:04:16.530> believe<00:04:16.680> a<00:04:16.950> trip<00:04:17.160> called

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
cuz we have I believe a trip called

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.910 
cuz we have I believe a trip called
Calvary<00:04:17.640> roll<00:04:18.030> which<00:04:18.239> lets<00:04:18.420> you<00:04:18.709> reroll<00:04:19.709> a

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
Calvary roll which lets you reroll a

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.390 
Calvary roll which lets you reroll a
dice<00:04:20.160> and<00:04:20.700> it's<00:04:20.910> just<00:04:21.060> that<00:04:21.180> simple<00:04:21.830> the<00:04:22.830> thing

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
dice and it's just that simple the thing

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.550 
dice and it's just that simple the thing
is<00:04:23.610> to<00:04:23.820> I<00:04:23.850> believe<00:04:24.360> I've<00:04:24.570> heard<00:04:24.810> before<00:04:25.200> you

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
is to I believe I've heard before you

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.990 
is to I believe I've heard before you
can<00:04:25.680> actually<00:04:25.770> use<00:04:26.010> this<00:04:26.130> effect<00:04:26.430> more<00:04:26.940> than

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
can actually use this effect more than

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.210 
can actually use this effect more than
once<00:04:27.330> per<00:04:27.390> turn<00:04:27.510> I<00:04:27.960> think<00:04:28.680> as<00:04:28.800> long<00:04:28.830> as<00:04:29.040> you're

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
once per turn I think as long as you're

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.740 
once per turn I think as long as you're
going<00:04:29.490> for<00:04:29.730> a<00:04:29.760> different<00:04:30.180> effect<00:04:30.450> and<00:04:30.630> like

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
going for a different effect and like

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.080 
going for a different effect and like
you<00:04:30.900> can't<00:04:31.110> use<00:04:31.980> it<00:04:32.100> to<00:04:32.130> take<00:04:32.310> twice<00:04:32.610> and<00:04:32.970> then

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
you can't use it to take twice and then

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.640 
you can't use it to take twice and then
do<00:04:33.210> the<00:04:33.330> sin<00:04:33.540> all<00:04:33.660> other<00:04:33.930> cards<00:04:34.170> on<00:04:34.290> the<00:04:34.440> field

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
do the sin all other cards on the field

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.950 
do the sin all other cards on the field
to<00:04:34.980> the<00:04:35.040> Graveyard<00:04:35.190> thing<00:04:35.670> as<00:04:35.820> an<00:04:36.180> example<00:04:36.510> but

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
to the Graveyard thing as an example but

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.690 
to the Graveyard thing as an example but
you<00:04:37.020> can<00:04:37.140> like<00:04:37.560> do<00:04:37.740> okay<00:04:38.070> the<00:04:38.190> first<00:04:38.400> effect

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
you can like do okay the first effect

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.960 
you can like do okay the first effect
and<00:04:38.880> then<00:04:39.000> roll<00:04:39.510> again<00:04:40.110> and<00:04:40.350> then<00:04:41.070> go<00:04:41.730> for<00:04:41.910> the

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
and then roll again and then go for the

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.190 
and then roll again and then go for the
third<00:04:42.150> effect<00:04:42.420> which<00:04:42.600> lets<00:04:42.780> you<00:04:42.840> draw<00:04:42.990> three

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
third effect which lets you draw three

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.810 
third effect which lets you draw three
cards<00:04:43.260> I<00:04:43.710> believe<00:04:43.980> you<00:04:44.130> can<00:04:44.340> do<00:04:44.430> that<00:04:44.460> correct

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
cards I believe you can do that correct

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:45.980 
cards I believe you can do that correct

it's number seven it it has to have
seven<00:04:55.260> for<00:04:55.500> the<00:04:55.590> effect<00:04:55.950> it's<00:04:56.310> seven<00:04:56.580> hundred

attack in the fence and it requires
level<00:04:58.740> seven<00:04:59.070> monsters<00:04:59.610> which<00:05:00.270> is<00:05:00.390> really

level seven monsters which is really

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.170

funny<00:05:01.550> but<00:05:02.550> this<00:05:02.700> is<00:05:02.820> the<00:05:02.910> one<00:05:03.060> I'm<00:05:03.150> most

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
funny but this is the one I'm most

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.240 
funny but this is the one I'm most
excited<00:05:03.450> about<00:05:03.810> to<00:05:04.050> be<00:05:04.140> honest<00:05:04.440> I<00:05:04.650> think<00:05:04.919> it

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
excited about to be honest I think it

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.770 
excited about to be honest I think it
will<00:05:05.370> be<00:05:05.490> the<00:05:05.640> most<00:05:05.790> fun<00:05:05.970> to<00:05:06.090> use<00:05:06.360> and<00:05:06.660> though

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
will be the most fun to use and though

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.870 
will be the most fun to use and though
it's<00:05:06.930> more<00:05:07.080> based<00:05:07.260> on<00:05:07.470> look<00:05:07.740> but<00:05:08.190> in<00:05:08.430> some<00:05:08.700> ways

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
it's more based on look but in some ways

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.150 
it's more based on look but in some ways
I<00:05:09.030> feel<00:05:09.060> like<00:05:09.210> it's<00:05:09.419> stronger<00:05:09.840> because<00:05:10.169> if<00:05:10.650> you

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
I feel like it's stronger because if you

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.190 
I feel like it's stronger because if you
can<00:05:11.370> actually<00:05:11.520> do<00:05:11.970> its<00:05:12.090> effect<00:05:12.330> right<00:05:12.630> it's

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
can actually do its effect right it's

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.659 
can actually do its effect right it's
gonna<00:05:13.350> be<00:05:13.500> really<00:05:13.650> powerful<00:05:13.800> monster<00:05:14.280> and<00:05:14.520> too

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
gonna be really powerful monster and too

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:17.180 
gonna be really powerful monster and too
even<00:05:14.910> if<00:05:15.000> not<00:05:15.410> you're<00:05:16.410> more<00:05:16.590> likely<00:05:16.860> it's

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
even if not you're more likely it's

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.530 
even if not you're more likely it's
gonna<00:05:17.370> getting<00:05:17.550> a<00:05:17.640> good<00:05:17.790> attack<00:05:18.060> as<00:05:18.300> long<00:05:18.330> as

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
gonna getting a good attack as long as

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.600 
gonna getting a good attack as long as
you<00:05:18.630> have<00:05:18.780> a<00:05:18.810> good<00:05:18.930> dice<00:05:19.230> roll<00:05:19.530> I<00:05:19.740> mean<00:05:20.490> you

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
think about it let's see I'll see if my

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.380 
think about it let's see I'll see if my
math<00:05:22.440> is<00:05:22.470> good<00:05:22.919> alright<00:05:23.280> you<00:05:23.370> roll<00:05:23.550> a<00:05:23.580> six<00:05:23.940> okay

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
math is good alright you roll a six okay

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.610 
math is good alright you roll a six okay
even<00:05:24.630> if<00:05:24.720> you<00:05:24.780> don't<00:05:24.930> get<00:05:25.020> one<00:05:25.169> of<00:05:25.200> its<00:05:25.350> effects

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
even if you don't get one of its effects

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.750 
even if you don't get one of its effects
you<00:05:26.160> used<00:05:26.400> its<00:05:27.650> other<00:05:28.650> ability<00:05:29.190> where<00:05:29.400> you<00:05:29.550> can

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
you used its other ability where you can

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.420 
you used its other ability where you can
multiply<00:05:30.630> it<00:05:30.690> times<00:05:30.870> 700<00:05:31.560> what<00:05:32.070> would<00:05:32.280> be<00:05:32.400> a

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
multiply it times 700 what would be a

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.930

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
let's see 4,200 attack if I'm not wrong

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.180 
let's see 4,200 attack if I'm not wrong
if<00:05:36.120> you<00:05:36.210> roll<00:05:36.360> a<00:05:36.390> six<00:05:36.630> see<00:05:37.350> that's<00:05:37.650> a<00:05:37.800> very

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
if you roll a six see that's a very

if you roll a six see that's a very
powerful<00:05:38.370> monster<00:05:38.880> still<00:05:39.090> or<00:05:39.360> you<00:05:39.630> know<00:05:39.750> you

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
powerful monster still or you know you

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.630 
powerful monster still or you know you
can<00:05:40.590> go<00:05:40.800> down<00:05:40.950> the<00:05:41.040> line<00:05:41.160> where<00:05:41.370> it<00:05:41.460> would<00:05:41.550> be

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
can go down the line where it would be

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.360 
can go down the line where it would be
like<00:05:41.820> five<00:05:42.060> would<00:05:42.300> be<00:05:42.470> 3,500<00:05:43.470> I<00:05:43.530> mean<00:05:43.680> really

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
like five would be 3,500 I mean really

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:45.830 
like five would be 3,500 I mean really
you<00:05:44.700> have<00:05:44.880> pretty<00:05:45.090> good<00:05:45.180> chances<00:05:45.660> of<00:05:45.780> getting

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
you have pretty good chances of getting

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.810 
you have pretty good chances of getting
a<00:05:45.990> powerful<00:05:46.350> monster<00:05:46.500> anyway<00:05:47.310> which<00:05:47.669> is

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
a powerful monster anyway which is

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.550 
a powerful monster anyway which is
really<00:05:48.090> nice<00:05:48.210> but<00:05:48.900> yeah<00:05:49.050> what<00:05:49.260> do<00:05:49.320> you<00:05:49.380> guys

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
really nice but yeah what do you guys

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.750 
really nice but yeah what do you guys
think<00:05:49.800> about<00:05:49.830> these<00:05:50.040> two<00:05:50.280> which<00:05:50.460> one<00:05:50.640> do<00:05:50.729> you

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:50.760 
think about these two which one do you

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.219 
think about these two which one do you
like<00:05:50.850> better<00:05:51.150> I<00:05:51.450> know<00:05:51.630> a<00:05:51.720> lot<00:05:51.930> of<00:05:51.990> people<00:05:52.140> been

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:52.229 
like better I know a lot of people been

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:53.960 
like better I know a lot of people been
talking<00:05:52.680> about<00:05:52.770> which<00:05:52.950> one<00:05:53.100> is<00:05:53.220> better<00:05:53.370> to<00:05:53.610> me

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
talking about which one is better to me

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.450 
talking about which one is better to me
I<00:05:54.150> feel<00:05:54.330> like<00:05:54.419> number<00:05:54.810> 7<00:05:55.229> is<00:05:55.350> better<00:05:55.530> yeah<00:05:55.890> I

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
I feel like number 7 is better yeah I

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.730 
I feel like number 7 is better yeah I
understand<00:05:57.180> that<00:05:57.240> number<00:05:57.450> 11<00:05:57.840> is<00:05:57.960> more<00:05:58.229> of<00:05:58.470> the

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
understand that number 11 is more of the

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.469 
understand that number 11 is more of the
if<00:05:59.100> you<00:05:59.160> want<00:05:59.430> to<00:05:59.460> go<00:05:59.550> the<00:05:59.669> safe<00:05:59.880> route<00:06:00.150> and

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 
if you want to go the safe route and

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:02.060 
if you want to go the safe route and
probably<00:06:00.960> easier<00:06:01.290> to<00:06:01.320> bring<00:06:01.500> out<00:06:01.680> because<00:06:01.919> it

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 
probably easier to bring out because it

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.969 
probably easier to bring out because it
just<00:06:02.160> requires<00:06:02.520> two<00:06:02.700> versus<00:06:03.060> three<00:06:03.169> but<00:06:04.169> lucky

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:04.979 
just requires two versus three but lucky

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:06.080 
just requires two versus three but lucky
straights<00:06:05.220> seems<00:06:05.460> like<00:06:05.580> it's<00:06:05.700> the<00:06:05.760> more<00:06:05.910> fun

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
straights seems like it's the more fun

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:07.790 
straights seems like it's the more fun
to<00:06:06.180> use<00:06:06.419> the<00:06:06.870> art<00:06:06.960> works<00:06:07.169> better<00:06:07.470> in<00:06:07.680> my

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
to use the art works better in my

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.740 
to use the art works better in my
opinion<00:06:07.860> just<00:06:08.220> everything<00:06:08.760> about<00:06:08.850> it<00:06:09.300> I<00:06:09.419> just

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.750 
opinion just everything about it I just

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.690 
opinion just everything about it I just
really<00:06:10.260> like<00:06:10.410> this<00:06:10.590> card<00:06:10.830> I<00:06:10.919> really<00:06:11.250> hope<00:06:11.580> I
