the other team is putting on recruit so

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.640 
the other team is putting on recruit so
that's<00:03:20.940> how<00:03:21.120> you<00:03:21.180> do<00:03:21.420> it<00:03:21.510> right<00:03:21.630> there<00:03:21.900> so

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
that's how you do it right there so

that's how you do it right there so
after<00:03:23.010> you<00:03:23.220> are<00:03:23.459> done<00:03:23.640> doing<00:03:24.000> that<00:03:24.120> you<00:03:24.269> could

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
after you are done doing that you could

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.479 
after you are done doing that you could
save<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.110> game<00:03:25.290> mode<00:03:25.530> just<00:03:25.890> because<00:03:26.220> if<00:03:26.400> you

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
you see right here picked up an a4

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.150 
you see right here picked up an a4
shocker<00:04:03.690> which<00:04:04.079> is<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.380> elite<00:04:04.560> version<00:04:04.769> of

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
shocker which is the elite version of

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.000 
shocker which is the elite version of
the<00:04:05.310> a4<00:04:05.880> and<00:04:06.180> it<00:04:06.600> looks<00:04:06.780> pretty<00:04:07.140> pretty<00:04:07.709> cool

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
the a4 and it looks pretty pretty cool

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.729 
the a4 and it looks pretty pretty cool
that's<00:04:08.310> why<00:04:08.459> I<00:04:08.489> have<00:04:08.820> team<00:04:09.570> killing<00:04:09.930> enabled

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
that's why I have team killing enabled

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.920 
that's why I have team killing enabled
because<00:04:11.040> I<00:04:11.609> can<00:04:11.790> kill<00:04:12.030> my<00:04:12.180> teammates<00:04:12.600> instead

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
because I can kill my teammates instead

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.750 
because I can kill my teammates instead
of<00:04:13.049> killing<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.859> enemies<00:04:14.250> and<00:04:14.489> you<00:04:14.640> know

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
of killing the enemies and you know

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.819 
of killing the enemies and you know
having<00:04:15.000> the<00:04:15.209> enemies<00:04:15.480> kill<00:04:15.750> me<00:04:15.989> I<00:04:16.229> could<00:04:16.709> just

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
having the enemies kill me I could just

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.349 
having the enemies kill me I could just
kill<00:04:17.039> my<00:04:17.160> teammates<00:04:17.549> and<00:04:17.609> just<00:04:17.789> pick<00:04:17.940> up<00:04:18.090> their

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
kill my teammates and just pick up their

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.409 
kill my teammates and just pick up their
84<00:04:18.870> because<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:19.620> my<00:04:20.220> teammates<00:04:20.729> they<00:04:20.970> are<00:04:21.090> set

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
84 because the my teammates they are set

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.719 
84 because the my teammates they are set
as<00:04:21.570> veteran<00:04:22.140> and<00:04:22.349> the<00:04:22.620> veteran<00:04:23.010> bots<00:04:23.370> have

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
as veteran and the veteran bots have

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.420 
as veteran and the veteran bots have
elite<00:04:24.630> versions<00:04:25.110> of<00:04:25.260> the<00:04:25.500> AAA<00:04:25.680> for<00:04:26.070> and<00:04:26.370> I'm

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
elite versions of the AAA for and I'm

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.879 
elite versions of the AAA for and I'm
pretty<00:04:26.490> sure<00:04:26.880> that<00:04:27.060> the<00:04:27.150> you<00:04:27.240> recruit

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:27.889 
pretty sure that the you recruit

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:29.950 
pretty sure that the you recruit
they<00:04:28.069> don't<00:04:28.219> even<00:04:28.340> have<00:04:28.460> elite<00:04:29.360> versions<00:04:29.719> MVA

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
they don't even have elite versions MVA

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.869 
they don't even have elite versions MVA
for<00:04:30.379> so<00:04:30.499> that's<00:04:30.590> why<00:04:30.800> i<00:04:30.830> said<00:04:30.949> earlier<00:04:31.340> to<00:04:31.669> put

00:04:31.869 --> 00:04:31.879 
for so that's why i said earlier to put

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:35.260 
for so that's why i said earlier to put
the<00:04:32.150> bots<00:04:32.900> your<00:04:33.469> BOTS<00:04:33.710> to<00:04:34.069> veterans<00:04:34.550> so<00:04:35.120> you

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
the bots your BOTS to veterans so you

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.959 
the bots your BOTS to veterans so you
pick<00:04:35.449> up<00:04:35.599> very<00:04:35.960> good<00:04:36.259> variants<00:04:36.830> of<00:04:36.979> the<00:04:37.099> a4<00:04:37.639> so

00:04:37.959 --> 00:04:37.969 
pick up very good variants of the a4 so

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:40.659 
pick up very good variants of the a4 so
with<00:04:38.539> this<00:04:38.810> you<00:04:39.139> are<00:04:39.529> able<00:04:39.650> to<00:04:39.860> choose<00:04:40.129> every

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
with this you are able to choose every

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:42.969 
with this you are able to choose every
single<00:04:41.060> variant<00:04:41.360> of<00:04:41.599> the<00:04:41.719> AAA<00:04:41.900> for<00:04:42.349> you<00:04:42.860> can

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:42.979 
single variant of the AAA for you can

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:45.070 
single variant of the AAA for you can
even<00:04:43.189> choose<00:04:43.370> you<00:04:43.879> know<00:04:43.999> both<00:04:44.360> Lee<00:04:44.599> versions

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
even choose you know both Lee versions

the game and everything and trying to

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:58.179 
the game and everything and trying to
figure<00:04:55.759> it<00:04:55.999> out<00:04:56.090> but<00:04:56.689> the<00:04:56.960> one<00:04:57.169> variable<00:04:57.979> you

figure it out but the one variable you
cannot<00:04:58.520> get<00:04:58.849> your<00:04:58.969> use<00:04:59.270> in<00:04:59.599> the<00:04:59.719> switch<00:05:00.050> is<00:05:00.349> the

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
cannot get your use in the switch is the

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.629 
cannot get your use in the switch is the
a<00:05:01.270> for<00:05:02.270> equinox<00:05:03.080> so<00:05:03.500> you<00:05:03.590> cannot<00:05:03.889> get<00:05:04.250> that<00:05:04.460> or

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 
a for equinox so you cannot get that or

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:07.029 
a for equinox so you cannot get that or
use<00:05:04.939> it<00:05:05.180> for<00:05:05.389> some<00:05:05.719> apparent<00:05:06.259> reason<00:05:06.620> i<00:05:06.770> am<00:05:06.919> not

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039

sure<00:05:07.099> why<00:05:07.610> but<00:05:08.449> you<00:05:08.779> can<00:05:08.960> use<00:05:09.199> every<00:05:09.650> single

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
sure why but you can use every single

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.330 
sure why but you can use every single
variant<00:05:10.310> of<00:05:10.520> the<00:05:10.729> a4<00:05:11.389> and<00:05:11.659> this<00:05:12.439> glitch<00:05:12.770> except

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
variant of the a4 and this glitch except

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.850 
variant of the a4 and this glitch except
for<00:05:13.520> the<00:05:13.610> a<00:05:13.639> for<00:05:14.240> equinox<00:05:14.930> i'm<00:05:15.379> not<00:05:15.500> sure<00:05:15.650> why

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
for the a for equinox i'm not sure why

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.429

but<00:05:16.669> that's<00:05:17.270> just<00:05:17.389> really<00:05:17.659> weird<00:05:17.930> but<00:05:18.229> you<00:05:18.319> can

00:05:18.429 --> 00:05:18.439 
but that's just really weird but you can

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:19.959 
but that's just really weird but you can
use<00:05:18.560> every<00:05:18.949> single<00:05:19.099> variant<00:05:19.520> you<00:05:19.639> guys<00:05:19.789> will
