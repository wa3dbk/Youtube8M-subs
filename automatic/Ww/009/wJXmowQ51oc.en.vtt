00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.540
 [Music] 

00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:08.099
 then hello archangel and angel furnace 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.000
 of the company the gems of vesuvio ci 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.300
 explains how pasta should be 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.300
 best in the world 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.980
 for count 5 hello to all friends 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.869
 exquisite of italy are scalciano fornaro 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.550
 and represents the granja pasta factory with 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.390
 the pasta law that respects the pasta 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.170
 best in the world 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.000
 there is no area where it can be produced 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.380
 the best way to make this pasta is 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.420
 rebuilt all over the world just follow 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.000
 the dogmas of a part the honey paste between 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.530
 the best vast in the world must start 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.989
 from the selected raw material and from 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.280
 very high quality then semolina water 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.950
 of wheat to say but durum wheat semolina 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.809
 made from a mixture of Italian wheat 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.250
 of international because the great 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.969
 national best and which our era was 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.980
 the Canadian one 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.750
 so the best pasta in the world starts 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.000
 from the simulated granillo selected in 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.190
 right way and interrupt for example 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.829
 from the senator hats contain gods 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.540
 hair and a large simulates that has a 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.220
 process for another of 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.630
 very special harvest because 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.489
 still handmade then i 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.660
 quantities of the vast they can 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.330
 be made with senator hats 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.550
 i have really really but yes it is a 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.260
 pasta that has an exceptional taste is 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.670
 also a very particular color very much 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.790
 different to boast with durum wheat 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.740
 classic that we can see around 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.320
 then what about the pasta is 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.640
 important to the kneading process the 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.920
 second must be mixed with water 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.630
 intimately in the slowest way and that 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.670
 recall the manual skills of the past 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.410
 possible is also important 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.240
 drawing the drawing must be 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.160
 made in bronze is one thing 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.200
 very important that distinguishes pasta 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.970
 crafted from industrial pasta la 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.320
 industrial pasta drawn in tackle but 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.180
 just a craftsman called in 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.100
 bronze the bronze what supplies 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.990
 provides temperature uniformity 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.759
 provides one during drawing 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.520
 porosity that arises from the fact that the 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.590
 bronze tends to slow the flow of 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.910
 paste coming out of the insert e 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.830
 this allows the pasta to have one 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.660
 exceptional porosity that we can see 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.759
 on each format from the nisha format 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.800
 dear trainers this thing with center 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.750
 at the time of the preparation of the 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.670
 pasta allows him to tie with 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.080
 any type of juice even without 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.830
 have the lining for this reason the 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.019
 homemade pasta 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.280
 just taken care of smooth smooth format with 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:14.790
 the classic one 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.470
 as for the drawing beyond 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.299
 then the homemade pasta to that one 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.950
 best should have a process 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.080
 drying as slow and as possible 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.180
 delicate slow what it means can 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.860
 say at very low temperatures 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.299
 below 50 degrees because temperatures 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.060
 elevated that use the slabs 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.860
 industrial imports to burn the 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.330
 paste then to cancel all the 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.430
 those that are the great qualities of a 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.810
 this is exceptional durum wheat semolina 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.970
 instead it does not happen in the process 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.000
 artisan craft process e 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.200
 happens around 48 50 degrees allows 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.600
 to keep all properties intact 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.070
 proteins gluten and this allows 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.840
 also to have so clear color 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.030
 very similar to that of the school of 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.560
 durum wheat to be used 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.720
 moreover the drying process must 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.790
 be static, what did you mean? 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.190
 that the pasta comes from post and comes 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.360
 dried as if exposed to the wind 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.730
 as it was once done 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.290
 ventilation must be lateral in 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.120
 this way that you go to simulate the fe 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.860
 the effect of the wind that met the 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.660
 all spaghetti for example is 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.090
 depicted in the images of so many years 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.549
 makes the Neapolitan pasta factories where 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.200
 they allowed all the spaghetti up 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.600
 of the boards and then put them on 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.430
 we answered the wind in a street but 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.560
 this thing that unfortunately cannot be 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.510
 more done with a simulation of this 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.510
 natural effect and for example how it is 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.519
 can see the pasta must vote only i 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.139
 test and long pasta this right that 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.900
 what the organization means was 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:36.090
 done by hand and been 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.370
 carried out on its auctions that come 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.410
 inserted into the long pasta e 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.389
 subsequently the long pasta comes 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.280
 exposed this slow ventilation 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:46.109
 dedicated that allows him to free 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.329
 the humidity from the other from the inside of the 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.829
 pasta very gradually 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.480
 this this allows him to 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:53.730
 get properties then 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.980
 at the time of cooking at the time of 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.510
 of the chewing of the properties that 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.910
 I'm really unique as a big one 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.590
 speed a great chewiness e 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.500
 especially the fact that a pasta that 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.919
 really so unstitches pasta 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.840
 artisanal pasta is par excellence 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:11.370
 naples but can also be produced in 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.590
 other places just follow i 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.609
 main dogmas archangel headquarters if it is 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.560
 was very kind 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:18.000
 thanks thanks to all the friends of 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.100
 an Italy spent all over Italy and me 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.660
 I recommend at this point I know that 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.550
 we know you're part of pasta 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.390
 best this point is to read me why 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.720
 if it is OK 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.720
