 Mediterranean 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:13.300
 from the seeds of this plant a dry extract very rich in saponins is obtained 

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:17.480
 the dosage of dry extract of fenugreek 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.319

 fenugreek extract is a tonic mainly physical rather than psychic 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.020
 in fact, fenugreek extract tends to increase muscle mass 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.160
 therefore also physical strength 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.620
 moreover it favors milk the capture by the muscle of the pin sugars of the 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.600
 glucose 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.359
 of fatty acids 

00:00:55.359 --> 00:01:00.959
 of micronutrients vitamins and mineral salts and this also favors the 

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:03.740
 muscle strength contraction 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.060
 also the fenugreek at the level of the spinal cord 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.620
 and favors is the production of red blood cells 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.030
 this is a reason why fenugreek extract comes 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.660
 also used to fight anemia 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.789
 especially iron deficiency anemia also because 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:24.770
 fenugreek is quite rich in iron 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.520
 therefore it is a plant that has an action 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.430
 we say tony h above all physical but also elderly mica reconstituent 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.590
 Fenugreek should not be used in pregnancy 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.780
 in the nursing woman it can instead be used in children from 3 years 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:45.500
 of age 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.550
 the side effects are practically non-existent only in rare cases 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.500
 cases can give some excitement of tachycardia 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.420
 but generally this does not happen at normal dosages 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.870
 the best way to use it and to do a couple of months cycles 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.630
 interspersed with a month of suspension
