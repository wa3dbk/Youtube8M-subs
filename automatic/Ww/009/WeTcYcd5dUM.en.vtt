was just terrible and so the US Army
Corps<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.059> Engineers<00:00:33.149> did<00:00:33.630> what<00:00:33.809> they<00:00:33.960> do<00:00:34.020> up

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
and down the Mississippi they built

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.360 
and down the Mississippi they built
levees<00:00:36.059> everyone<00:00:36.660> was<00:00:36.809> like<00:00:36.989> cool<00:00:37.590> no<00:00:38.160> more

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370

flooding<00:00:38.850> we<00:00:39.420> tamed<00:00:39.719> nature<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.530> then<00:00:41.070> in

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
flooding we tamed nature and then in

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.240 
flooding we tamed nature and then in
1937<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.270> flooded<00:00:42.930> again<00:00:43.050> because<00:00:43.739> every<00:00:44.040> time

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
1937 it flooded again because every time

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.100 
1937 it flooded again because every time
they<00:00:44.430> built<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.760> levee<00:00:45.000> somewhere<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.750> area

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
they built a levee somewhere that area

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.869 
they built a levee somewhere that area
wouldn't<00:00:46.320> flood<00:00:46.620> but<00:00:46.860> like<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.010> town<00:00:47.340> just<00:00:47.370> a

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
wouldn't flood but like a town just a

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.869 
wouldn't flood but like a town just a
few<00:00:47.910> miles<00:00:48.270> down<00:00:48.450> would<00:00:49.350> be<00:00:49.530> destroyed<00:00:50.430> they

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
few miles down would be destroyed they

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.779 
few miles down would be destroyed they
didn't<00:00:51.090> understand<00:00:51.780> how<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.649> river<00:00:53.160> really

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
didn't understand how the river really

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.790 
work corporal Eugene Raybould this guy
had<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.579> genius<00:00:56.879> idea<00:00:57.149> he<00:00:57.809> was<00:00:57.930> like<00:00:58.140> why<00:00:58.739> don't

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
had a genius idea he was like why don't

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.310 
had a genius idea he was like why don't
we<00:00:59.640> model<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.180> what<00:01:00.539> this<00:01:00.660> meant<00:01:01.020> was

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
we model and what this meant was

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.549 
we model and what this meant was
literally<00:01:02.129> why<00:01:02.640> don't<00:01:03.030> we<00:01:03.239> build<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.780> gigantic

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
literally why don't we build a gigantic

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.039 
literally why don't we build a gigantic
model<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:07.610> so<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.729> notion<00:01:08.939> was<00:01:09.390> let's<00:01:09.840> make

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
model of it so the notion was let's make

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.750 
model of it so the notion was let's make
a<00:01:10.080> scale<00:01:10.380> model<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.860> tiny<00:01:11.130> version<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
a scale model a tiny version of the

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.940 
a scale model a tiny version of the
entire<00:01:12.119> Mississippi<00:01:12.840> River<00:01:13.020> Basin<00:01:13.229> scale<00:01:13.770> of

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
entire Mississippi River Basin scale of

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.530 
entire Mississippi River Basin scale of
this<00:01:14.040> model<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:14.610> amazing<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.330> meant

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
this model is is amazing it meant

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.100 
this model is is amazing it meant
building<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.990> model<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.850> 40%<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.360> entire<00:01:18.720> US

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
building a model of 40% of the entire US

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.399 
building a model of 40% of the entire US
eight<00:01:19.590> miles<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.189> tiny<00:01:20.520> streams<00:01:21.119> it's<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:22.080> big

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
eight miles of tiny streams it's so big

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.249 
eight miles of tiny streams it's so big
you<00:01:22.439> can't<00:01:22.950> see<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.400> except<00:01:23.880> from<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.630> plane<00:01:25.049> or

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
you can't see it except from a plane or

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:25.910 
you can't see it except from a plane or
a<00:01:25.290> helicopter

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
a helicopter

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.130 
a helicopter
cuz<00:01:26.040> it's<00:01:26.159> read<00:01:26.490> out<00:01:26.640> over<00:01:26.880> 200<00:01:27.420> acres<00:01:27.600> the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
cuz it's read out over 200 acres the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.810 
cuz it's read out over 200 acres the
whole<00:01:28.290> thing<00:01:28.409> was<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.560> hydraulic<00:01:29.070> model<00:01:29.369> so

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
whole thing was a hydraulic model so

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.630 
whole thing was a hydraulic model so
they<00:01:29.970> could<00:01:30.240> just<00:01:30.869> pull<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.170> lever<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.799> run

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
they could just pull a lever and run

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.179 
they could just pull a lever and run
through<00:01:32.939> an<00:01:33.060> entire<00:01:33.509> flood<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.710> don't<00:01:34.890> let<00:01:34.979> them

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
through an entire flood I don't let them

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.550 
through an entire flood I don't let them
put<00:01:35.850> up<00:01:35.970> little<00:01:36.210> levees<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.810> figure<00:01:37.020> out<00:01:37.079> okay

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
put up little levees and figure out okay

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.789 
put up little levees and figure out okay
if<00:01:37.650> we<00:01:37.740> put<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.950> levee<00:01:38.159> here<00:01:38.610> what<00:01:39.509> happens<00:01:39.900> down

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
if we put a levee here what happens down

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.859 
if we put a levee here what happens down
the<00:01:40.979> river<00:01:41.159> they<00:01:41.460> used<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.880> stop<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.570> flood

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
the river they used it to stop a flood

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.200 
the river they used it to stop a flood
in<00:01:42.960> Omaha<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.470> save<00:01:43.649> 65<00:01:44.310> million<00:01:44.579> dollars<00:01:45.030> at

the land you could walk from the south

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.219 
the land you could walk from the south
to<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.190> Midwest<00:02:08.610> in<00:02:08.849> five<00:02:09.209> minutes<00:02:09.629> six<00:02:10.020> years

to the Midwest in five minutes six years
after<00:02:10.349> they'd<00:02:10.530> finished<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:11.039> they<00:02:11.760> were<00:02:11.819> done

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
the

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.590 
the
test<00:02:12.960> using<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.820> Mississippi<00:02:14.820> River<00:02:15.000> model

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
test using the Mississippi River model

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.630 
test using the Mississippi River model
was<00:02:15.810> run<00:02:16.080> they<00:02:16.680> didn't<00:02:16.890> need<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:17.100> anymore<00:02:17.280> they
