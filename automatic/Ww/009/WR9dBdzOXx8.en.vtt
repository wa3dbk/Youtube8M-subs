00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
if I can that would be a good one this

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.870 
if I can that would be a good one this
mechanism<00:00:34.110> here<00:00:34.469> goes<00:00:34.680> up<00:00:34.920> them<00:00:35.160> down<00:00:35.430> I'm

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
mechanism here goes up them down I'm

going to show you what right now it's up
on<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.070> lever<00:00:38.340> it's<00:00:38.670> like<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.850> like<00:00:39.360> what<00:00:39.570> you

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
on the lever it's like a like what you

motivates<00:00:47.039> like<00:00:47.309> this<00:00:50.780> operates<00:00:51.780> on<00:00:51.960> both

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
motivates like this operates on both

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.250 
motivates like this operates on both
sides<00:00:52.699> the<00:00:53.699> way<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.059> comes<00:00:54.360> from<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.870> factory

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260

before there's just not enough action
for<00:01:35.549> this<00:01:35.970> brake<00:01:36.390> when<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.840> lever<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.470> there

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
for this brake when that lever is there

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.410 
for this brake when that lever is there
you<00:01:37.829> can<00:01:37.979> see<00:01:38.159> how<00:01:38.250> this<00:01:38.369> thing<00:01:38.430> mounts<00:01:39.329> in

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
you can see how this thing mounts in

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.210 
you can see how this thing mounts in
there<00:01:39.570> check<00:01:39.750> this<00:01:39.900> out<00:01:40.049> how<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.350> had<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.680> this

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
there check this out how that had a this

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.850 
there check this out how that had a this
adjusting<00:01:41.939> nut<00:01:42.119> would<00:01:42.810> screw<00:01:43.140> in<00:01:43.350> which<00:01:43.680> would

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
adjusting nut would screw in which would

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.620 
adjusting nut would screw in which would
then<00:01:44.040> in<00:01:44.070> turn<00:01:44.189> make<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.119> tighter<00:01:45.420> and

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
then in turn make that tighter and

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.090 
then in turn make that tighter and
tighter<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.470> get<00:01:46.590> where<00:01:46.740> I'm<00:01:46.829> coming<00:01:46.860> from

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:47.789 
it from going back and forth as well as
it<00:03:43.599> gives<00:03:43.840> it<00:03:44.019> that<00:03:44.049> smush<00:03:44.530> factor<00:03:46.500> so<00:03:47.500> it<00:03:47.620> gets

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
it gives it that smush factor so it gets

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.409 
it gives it that smush factor so it gets
right<00:03:47.949> in<00:03:48.099> the<00:03:48.190> senator<00:03:48.639> and<00:03:48.790> now<00:03:48.909> obviously

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:49.419 
right in the senator and now obviously

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:51.509 
right in the senator and now obviously
that<00:03:49.720> would<00:03:49.870> be<00:03:49.900> way<00:03:50.229> too<00:03:50.260> down<00:03:50.769> far<00:03:51.099> but<00:03:51.340> boy

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
that would be way too down far but boy

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:52.979 
that would be way too down far but boy
that<00:03:51.549> would<00:03:51.879> that's<00:03:52.180> going<00:03:52.419> to<00:03:52.479> give<00:03:52.659> you<00:03:52.750> some

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
that would that's going to give you some

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.349 
that would that's going to give you some
serious<00:03:53.470> action<00:03:53.769> so<00:03:54.669> now<00:03:54.849> we<00:03:54.909> got<00:03:55.120> to<00:03:55.209> figure

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
serious action so now we got to figure

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:59.819 
serious action so now we got to figure
out<00:03:55.829> where<00:03:56.940> in<00:03:57.940> general<00:03:58.510> I<00:03:58.840> want<00:03:59.109> to<00:03:59.260> be<00:03:59.379> so

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
out where in general I want to be so

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.110 
out where in general I want to be so
we're<00:04:00.010> going<00:04:00.099> to<00:04:00.190> kind<00:04:00.310> of<00:04:00.430> figure<00:04:00.609> that<00:04:00.879> out

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
we're going to kind of figure that out

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.309 
we're going to kind of figure that out
we're<00:04:01.299> going<00:04:01.389> to<00:04:01.449> make<00:04:01.599> sure<00:04:01.750> that<00:04:01.900> all<00:04:02.079> of<00:04:02.229> the

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
we're going to make sure that all of the

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:03.780 
we're going to make sure that all of the
threads<00:04:02.590> are<00:04:02.799> being<00:04:03.040> covered<00:04:03.310> and<00:04:03.579> and

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
threads are being covered and and

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.699 
threads are being covered and and
threaded<00:04:04.269> on<00:04:04.419> like<00:04:04.690> about<00:04:04.959> two<00:04:05.139> there<00:04:05.349> and

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
threaded on like about two there and

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.979 
threaded on like about two there and
we're<00:04:06.430> going<00:04:06.579> to<00:04:06.639> kind<00:04:06.879> of<00:04:06.940> interpolate<00:04:07.690> that

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
we're going to kind of interpolate that

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.869 
we're going to kind of interpolate that
shouldn't<00:04:08.440> be<00:04:08.560> too<00:04:08.799> bad<00:04:09.040> from<00:04:09.430> about<00:04:09.699> two

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:09.879 
shouldn't be too bad from about two

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:15.180 
shouldn't be too bad from about two
there<00:04:10.060> maybe<00:04:10.359> we<00:04:10.599> go<00:04:10.750> down<00:04:10.959> one<00:04:13.979> one<00:04:14.979> more

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
there maybe we go down one one more

there maybe we go down one one more
we'll<00:04:15.729> go<00:04:15.909> to<00:04:15.970> here<00:04:16.320> no<00:04:17.320> that's<00:04:17.590> too<00:04:17.769> much
