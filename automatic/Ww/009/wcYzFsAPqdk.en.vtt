00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.180
 I'm only Stefano Gallo 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.590
 chef of the restaurant la bari di torino 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.000
 today spring day we present you some recipes you follow 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.499
 our kitchens 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:16.990
 and finally the collaborators 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.420
 today we prepare some exotic fruits from the marina tinello 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:24.339
 then we need whitebait 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:25.310
 the mango 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.529
 pineapple 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.380
 orange passion fruit 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.020
 to dress instead we use the soy sauce of extra virgin olive oil 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.740
 olive 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:35.890
 of salt 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.870
 the rum aged 3 years 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.950
 we need to complete the dish 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.960
 very fine cut pineapple and seasonal flowers 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.760
 it is a fly we will find again from the 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.310
 from these assumptions blended together 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.200
 whispering place dishes first and foremost we need to marinate slightly 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.090
 whitebait with 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.090
 a voice only seen history 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.150
 and a little extra virgin olive oil 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.150
 we do not use salt for you yellow soy sauce 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.730
 his stupidity 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.790
 we mix them well 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.950
 and while they cook with the story but let's marinate the pineapple 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.910
 we need to marinate the frog 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.910
 a drop of rum 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.200
 the salt 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.200
 we use maldon salt 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.760
 for a little extra virgin olive oil 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.210
 this dish is very simple after making the mousse 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.200
 roncato d rapid execution 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.740
 perkÃ¨ the whitebait later 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.910
 uhauha have been few moments in history change consistency 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.190
 and we begin to cook they become whiter 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.300
 they must do this last step 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.570
 flor now we can serve 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.639
 master starter 

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.639
 the most important thing to serve raw fish 

00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:18.559
 eh buy it in places where we are sure that the fish is fresh 

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:19.560
 do not use 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.089
 eheh frozen products 

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:26.910
 if you rather spend a little more but use a perfect fish 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.579
 but right now we do it with an electrical system 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:33.099
 this preparation can be done with any other type of fish starting 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:34.249
 from shellfish 

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:37.389
 large-sized civil part 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:40.279
 because the most important thing is always freshness 

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:45.069
 then we put two strips of this fly as a base for the dish we kept 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.069
 from among exotic fruits 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:50.889
 let's put pineapple 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:53.889
 that we will need to keep on all the preparation 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:59.419
 and put a few leaves of salad 

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:07.229
 because it is also important that when 

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:10.239
 so fans of this dish have one 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.239
 pisa crunchy in the mouth 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:17.229
 we can start pissing off that I love fish 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:20.409
 les now after a few minutes of marinating 

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:23.759
 the whitebait is almost cooked 

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:26.759
 we get a drop of oil at the end exo dare 

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:30.399
 a fresh taste 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.829
 and let's start on paper 

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:43.349
 now 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:48.059
 hair practically flat out of pity and almost ready for the last 

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:50.319
 seasoning for the whitebait 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.789
 heller passion fruit that we have previously shelled 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.349
 and place fish on top gently 

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:07.079
 It is important that all fish have at least some of this fruit 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.269
 passion for it we can use as a garnish on the plate 

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:20.249
 we still have some pineapple 

00:04:20.249 --> 00:04:22.689
 we can use to do 

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:25.740
 a little color to give our dish height 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:33.240
 now we finish with one 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.080
 the decorations we used 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.300
 we use edible flowers 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.930
 which in addition to being decorative have their own personality with regard to 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.199
 sopor also the herb we use 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.289
 they have one 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:47.479
 a particular flavor 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:50.479
 then -d we operate a little from net 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:55.199
 of carrot sprout 

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:04.490
 pepper for today we have 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.490
 of violets 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:14.199
 of purple bell roses 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:23.099
 ready plate we can put 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:26.099
 still a bit of salt 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.300
 pedophile women 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:36.669
 lawn ready to serve
