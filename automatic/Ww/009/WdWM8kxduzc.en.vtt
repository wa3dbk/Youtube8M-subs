00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.390 
remove the footage from the SD card that
way<00:01:03.379> another<00:01:04.379> useful<00:01:04.589> feature<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:05.070> this<00:01:05.250> is

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
way another useful feature of this is

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.580 
way another useful feature of this is
the<00:01:05.489> actual<00:01:05.640> G<00:01:06.240> sensor<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.140> can<00:01:07.290> actually

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
the actual G sensor so it can actually

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.160 
the actual G sensor so it can actually
tell<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:07.950> how<00:01:08.009> fast<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:09.210> are<00:01:09.240> breaking<00:01:09.869> in

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
tell you how fast you are breaking in

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.630 
tell you how fast you are breaking in
the<00:01:10.409> event<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.950> an<00:01:11.100> accident

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
the event of an accident

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.210 
the event of an accident
it<00:01:12.299> also<00:01:12.450> has<00:01:12.659> GPS<00:01:12.810> so<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.770> can<00:01:13.920> tell<00:01:14.070> you

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
it also has GPS so it can tell you

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.859 
it also has GPS so it can tell you
exactly<00:01:14.640> where<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.180> are<00:01:15.210> when<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.630> have<00:01:15.659> the

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
exactly where you are when you have the

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.469 
exactly where you are when you have the
accident<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.609> camera<00:01:17.939> like<00:01:18.030> this<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.450> very

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
accident so a camera like this is very

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.319 
accident so a camera like this is very
useful<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.609> I'm<00:01:20.609> gonna<00:01:20.850> go<00:01:20.999> through<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.240> couple

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.329 
useful and I'm gonna go through a couple

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:22.880 
useful and I'm gonna go through a couple
of<00:01:21.689> things<00:01:21.899> in<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.289> van<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.590> then<00:01:22.710> I'm<00:01:22.770> going

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
of things in the van and then I'm going

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.080 
of things in the van and then I'm going
to<00:01:22.979> show<00:01:23.069> you<00:01:23.130> some<00:01:23.340> really<00:01:23.789> good<00:01:23.880> footage

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:25.240 

Oh

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.870 

all<00:03:25.790> right

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
all right

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:59.330 
all right
where<00:03:27.450> someday

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.340 

the<00:03:59.760> chemo<00:04:00.000> specialist<00:04:00.540> for<00:04:01.340> the<00:04:03.140> week<00:04:04.140> really

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
the chemo specialist for the week really

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.339 
the chemo specialist for the week really
looking<00:04:04.800> forward<00:04:05.040> in<00:04:05.220> the<00:04:05.310> face

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:10.199 

I<00:04:08.379> think<00:04:09.010> that<00:04:09.159> made<00:04:09.310> a<00:04:09.340> few<00:04:09.579> places<00:04:09.790> stolen

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.739 
I think that made a few places stolen
before<00:04:10.480> from<00:04:10.689> them<00:04:10.870> attracted<00:04:11.349> by<00:04:11.439> the<00:04:11.499> rare
