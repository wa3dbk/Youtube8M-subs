00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.209 
straight into a bowel and hopefully get
our<00:01:15.990> second<00:01:16.350> win<00:01:16.499> of<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.619> cities<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:16.979> our

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:17.219 
our second win of the cities and our

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:19.819 
our second win of the cities and our
second<00:01:17.670> evolution<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:19.079> turns<00:01:19.350> out<00:01:19.529> to<00:01:19.590> be

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:19.829 
second evolution so it turns out to be

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:21.800 
second evolution so it turns out to be
pretty<00:01:20.219> likely<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.209> that<00:01:21.389> is<00:01:21.569> going<00:01:21.630> to

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
pretty likely that that is going to

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.510 
pretty likely that that is going to
happen<00:01:21.899> when<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.409> see<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:22.709> guy's<00:01:22.920> team<00:01:23.189> is

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
happen when you see this guy's team is

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.039 
happen when you see this guy's team is
going<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.969> start<00:01:24.149> a<00:01:24.270> pack<00:01:24.420> team<00:01:24.569> just<00:01:24.840> managed

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
going to start a pack team just managed

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.480 
going to start a pack team just managed
to<00:01:25.079> get<00:01:25.259> people<00:01:25.560> all<00:01:25.740> in<00:01:25.889> the<00:01:25.979> right<00:01:26.100> position

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
to get people all in the right position

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.099 
to get people all in the right position
which<00:01:26.819> hats<00:01:27.090> off<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.389> the<00:01:27.479> guy<00:01:27.630> if<00:01:27.840> he's<00:01:27.990> in

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:28.109 
which hats off to the guy if he's in

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:30.169 
which hats off to the guy if he's in
this<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.469> his<00:01:28.590> first<00:01:28.770> game<00:01:29.069> but<00:01:29.670> we<00:01:29.969> are<00:01:30.060> going

00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:30.179 
this is his first game but we are going

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:31.580 
this is his first game but we are going
to<00:01:30.240> take<00:01:30.329> advantage<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.959> the<00:01:31.170> fact<00:01:31.319> that<00:01:31.439> he's

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
to take advantage of the fact that he's

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.899 
to take advantage of the fact that he's
got<00:01:31.709> to<00:01:31.799> start<00:01:32.009> back<00:01:32.219> and<00:01:32.399> probably<00:01:32.549> new<00:01:32.880> to

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
got to start back and probably new to

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.209 
got to start back and probably new to
foot<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.479> just<00:01:34.049> start<00:01:34.289> absolutely<00:01:34.859> digging

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:35.219 
foot and just start absolutely digging

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:36.739 
foot and just start absolutely digging
on<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:35.459> guy<00:01:35.639> and<00:01:35.849> giving<00:01:36.119> him<00:01:36.209> the<00:01:36.359> sausage

00:01:36.739 --> 00:01:36.749 
on this guy and giving him the sausage

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:38.149 
on this guy and giving him the sausage
so<00:01:36.929> we<00:01:37.049> started<00:01:37.380> off<00:01:37.499> in<00:01:37.649> the<00:01:37.679> seventh<00:01:38.069> minute

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
so we started off in the seventh minute

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.859 
so we started off in the seventh minute
with<00:01:38.399> a<00:01:38.429> goal<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.880> he's<00:01:39.329> only<00:01:39.420> just<00:01:39.599> pick

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
with a goal and he's only just pick

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.629 
with a goal and he's only just pick

quits<00:02:30.180> we<00:02:30.510> get<00:02:30.660> an<00:02:30.780> evolution<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.410> it<00:02:31.530> is

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
quits we get an evolution and it is

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.350 
quits we get an evolution and it is
going<00:02:31.770> to<00:02:31.860> be<00:02:31.890> pinned<00:02:32.550> saw<00:02:32.850> glee<00:02:33.090> oh<00:02:33.120> that's

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
going to be pinned saw glee oh that's

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.820 
going to be pinned saw glee oh that's
evolving<00:02:33.810> so<00:02:34.230> I'm<00:02:34.380> probably<00:02:34.500> going<00:02:34.740> to

evolving so I'm probably going to

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.440 
evolving so I'm probably going to
struggle<00:02:35.010> with<00:02:35.160> a<00:02:35.280> couple<00:02:35.550> of<00:02:35.610> these<00:02:35.730> really

it's<00:02:36.840> hallie<00:02:37.140> names<00:02:37.530> but<00:02:37.830> it<00:02:38.310> is<00:02:38.459> the

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
it's hallie names but it is the

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.740 
it's hallie names but it is the
goalkeeper<00:02:38.970> that<00:02:39.090> we<00:02:39.209> are<00:02:39.300> going<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.510> be<00:02:39.600> doing

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
goalkeeper that we are going to be doing

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.510 
goalkeeper that we are going to be doing
and<00:02:40.140> we've<00:02:40.260> gone<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:40.530> got<00:02:40.620> ourselves<00:02:40.740> a<00:02:41.160> rare

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
and we've gone and got ourselves a rare

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.370 
and we've gone and got ourselves a rare
bronze<00:02:41.880> goalkeeper<00:02:42.390> in<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.690> form<00:02:42.930> of<00:02:43.080> core

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
bronze goalkeeper in the form of core

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.230 
bronze goalkeeper in the form of core
does<00:02:43.620> bit<00:02:44.100> of<00:02:44.190> an<00:02:44.280> easier<00:02:44.490> name<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.790> say<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.120> a

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
does bit of an easier name to say and a

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.210 
does bit of an easier name to say and a
much<00:02:45.510> better<00:02:45.780> goalkeeper<00:02:46.110> so<00:02:46.530> hopefully

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
much better goalkeeper so hopefully

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.860 
much better goalkeeper so hopefully
we'll<00:02:47.310> keep<00:02:47.790> him<00:02:47.910> tightening<00:02:48.330> up<00:02:48.450> at<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:48.690> back

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
we'll keep him tightening up at the back

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.660 
we'll keep him tightening up at the back
although<00:02:49.170> we<00:02:49.260> haven't<00:02:49.380> been<00:02:49.890> conceding<00:02:50.459> too

although we haven't been conceding too
many<00:02:50.880> goals<00:02:51.120> but<00:02:51.600> we<00:02:51.690> just<00:02:51.870> wanted<00:02:52.140> that

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
many goals but we just wanted that

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.449 
many goals but we just wanted that
assurance<00:02:52.650> that<00:02:52.830> we<00:02:53.010> have<00:02:53.100> got<00:02:53.220> a<00:02:53.250> decent

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
many games so this was a very tight game

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.580 
many games so this was a very tight game
but<00:03:35.519> in<00:03:35.700> the<00:03:35.850> 21st<00:03:36.390> minute<00:03:36.510> he<00:03:37.080> did<00:03:37.320> get<00:03:37.500> a<00:03:37.530> bit

did<00:03:41.220> give<00:03:41.370> us<00:03:41.489> a<00:03:41.580> little<00:03:41.730> bit<00:03:41.880> more<00:03:42.090> space<00:03:42.330> a

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
did give us a little bit more space a

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.090 
did give us a little bit more space a
little<00:03:42.810> bit<00:03:43.019> more<00:03:43.170> time<00:03:43.380> to<00:03:43.410> pick<00:03:43.769> the<00:03:43.920> holes
