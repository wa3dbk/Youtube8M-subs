about these grid lines now you'll see on
my<00:00:28.730> camera<00:00:29.480> app<00:00:29.660> I<00:00:29.929> have<00:00:30.679> grid<00:00:31.189> lines<00:00:31.460> I<00:00:31.670> always

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
my camera app I have grid lines I always

my camera app I have grid lines I always
have<00:00:32.269> them<00:00:32.419> there<00:00:32.629> when<00:00:32.780> I<00:00:32.809> go<00:00:33.019> out<00:00:33.170> to<00:00:33.320> take

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.470 
have them there when I go out to take

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.710 
have them there when I go out to take
photographs<00:00:33.769> I<00:00:34.250> generally<00:00:34.730> try<00:00:34.970> to<00:00:35.000> stick<00:00:35.449> by

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
photographs I generally try to stick by

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.110 
photographs I generally try to stick by
the<00:00:35.780> rule<00:00:36.260> of<00:00:36.290> thirds<00:00:36.680> and<00:00:37.010> that<00:00:37.100> if<00:00:37.670> you<00:00:37.850> don't

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
the rule of thirds and that if you don't

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.020 
the rule of thirds and that if you don't
know<00:00:38.299> is<00:00:38.659> for<00:00:39.409> whatever<00:00:39.589> reason<00:00:40.280> for<00:00:40.309> the<00:00:40.879> way

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
know is for whatever reason for the way

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.689 
know is for whatever reason for the way
our<00:00:41.210> minds<00:00:41.600> and<00:00:42.019> our<00:00:42.110> eyes<00:00:42.500> work<00:00:43.010> for<00:00:43.400> whatever

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:43.699 
our minds and our eyes work for whatever

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:45.820 
our minds and our eyes work for whatever
reason<00:00:44.269> stuff<00:00:44.600> that's<00:00:44.839> on<00:00:45.019> the<00:00:45.320> third<00:00:45.350> lines

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:45.830 
reason stuff that's on the third lines

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.549 
reason stuff that's on the third lines
tends<00:00:46.250> to<00:00:46.519> make<00:00:46.699> a<00:00:46.729> picture<00:00:47.239> look<00:00:47.900> better<00:00:48.199> for

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
tends to make a picture look better for

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.100 
tends to make a picture look better for
instance<00:00:49.040> if<00:00:49.250> you<00:00:50.210> look<00:00:50.239> through<00:00:50.629> my<00:00:50.750> camera

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
instance if you look through my camera

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.930 
instance if you look through my camera
app<00:00:51.199> now<00:00:51.440> if<00:00:51.559> I<00:00:51.650> put<00:00:51.860> the<00:00:51.979> bottom<00:00:52.309> of<00:00:52.489> the<00:00:52.699> books

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
app now if I put the bottom of the books

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.630 
app now if I put the bottom of the books
just<00:00:53.900> at<00:00:54.140> the<00:00:54.290> top<00:00:54.530> of<00:00:54.710> the<00:00:54.860> third<00:00:55.070> line<00:00:55.369> the

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
just at the top of the third line the

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.310 
just at the top of the third line the
picture<00:00:56.059> looks<00:00:56.269> like<00:00:56.479> it's<00:00:56.659> better<00:00:56.900> split<00:00:57.199> up

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
picture looks like it's better split up

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.500 
picture looks like it's better split up
whereas<00:00:57.920> if<00:00:58.129> I<00:00:58.280> kind<00:00:58.580> of<00:00:58.729> leave<00:00:58.909> it<00:00:58.940> at<00:00:59.150> the<00:00:59.299> top

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
whereas if I kind of leave it at the top

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.180 
whereas if I kind of leave it at the top
it<00:00:59.780> looks<00:00:59.930> awful<00:01:00.470> if<00:01:00.589> I<00:01:00.680> leave<00:01:00.860> it<00:01:00.979> halfway

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
it looks awful if I leave it halfway

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.850 
it looks awful if I leave it halfway
down<00:01:01.689> equally<00:01:02.689> it<00:01:02.930> doesn't<00:01:03.229> look<00:01:03.379> so<00:01:03.589> great

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
down equally it doesn't look so great

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.679 
down equally it doesn't look so great
but<00:01:04.100> if<00:01:04.250> I<00:01:04.339> pop<00:01:04.549> it<00:01:04.699> on<00:01:04.879> one<00:01:05.239> of<00:01:05.269> the<00:01:05.479> third

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
but if I pop it on one of the third

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.470 
but if I pop it on one of the third
lines<00:01:05.990> it<00:01:06.350> looks<00:01:06.710> good<00:01:06.950> and<00:01:07.850> that's<00:01:08.090> just<00:01:08.360> the

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:08.480 
lines it looks good and that's just the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.030 
lines it looks good and that's just the
way<00:01:08.600> it<00:01:08.750> works<00:01:08.990> you<00:01:09.200> generally<00:01:09.680> put<00:01:09.710> the

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
way it works you generally put the

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.250 
way it works you generally put the
object<00:01:10.490> that<00:01:10.610> you<00:01:10.760> want<00:01:11.000> to<00:01:11.090> focus<00:01:11.270> on<00:01:11.660> on<00:01:11.870> one

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
object that you want to focus on on one

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.860 
object that you want to focus on on one
of<00:01:12.290> those<00:01:12.530> third<00:01:12.860> lines<00:01:13.190> and<00:01:14.120> it's<00:01:14.450> not<00:01:14.600> just

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
of those third lines and it's not just

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.690 
of those third lines and it's not just
about<00:01:15.170> putting<00:01:15.470> the<00:01:15.650> object<00:01:16.010> our<00:01:16.160> third<00:01:16.460> line

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
about putting the object our third line

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.910 
about putting the object our third line
it's<00:01:17.030> also<00:01:17.330> about<00:01:17.630> splitting<00:01:18.260> the<00:01:18.470> image<00:01:18.740> up

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
it's also about splitting the image up

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.190 
it's also about splitting the image up
into<00:01:19.340> I<00:01:19.580> guess<00:01:20.000> different<00:01:20.420> sections<00:01:20.870> but<00:01:21.080> to

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
into I guess different sections but to

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.340 
into I guess different sections but to
actually<00:01:21.530> activate<00:01:21.980> those<00:01:22.480> unlike<00:01:23.480> iOS<00:01:23.750> six

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
actually activate those unlike iOS six

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.700 
actually activate those unlike iOS six
you<00:01:24.530> can't<00:01:24.800> just<00:01:25.900> access<00:01:26.900> an<00:01:27.050> option<00:01:27.350> on<00:01:27.470> the

you can't just access an option on the

you can't just access an option on the
camera<00:01:28.070> app<00:01:28.160> itself<00:01:28.580> you<00:01:28.730> have<00:01:28.760> to<00:01:29.030> go<00:01:29.210> back

now<00:05:24.560> what<00:05:24.770> HDR<00:05:25.280> does<00:05:25.580> is<00:05:25.820> if<00:05:26.210> you<00:05:26.240> have<00:05:27.130> an

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
now what HDR does is if you have an

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.490 
now what HDR does is if you have an
image<00:05:28.370> that's<00:05:28.490> got<00:05:28.880> very<00:05:29.290> stark<00:05:30.290> contrast

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
image that's got very stark contrast

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.560 
image that's got very stark contrast
between<00:05:31.070> the<00:05:31.430> bright<00:05:31.670> and<00:05:31.940> the<00:05:32.090> dark<00:05:32.330> patches

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
between the bright and the dark patches

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.390 
between the bright and the dark patches
it<00:05:32.900> kind<00:05:33.080> of<00:05:33.170> evens<00:05:33.470> the<00:05:33.620> image<00:05:33.830> out<00:05:33.980> a<00:05:34.010> little

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
it kind of evens the image out a little

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.850 
it kind of evens the image out a little
bit<00:05:34.520> so<00:05:34.820> let's<00:05:35.030> just<00:05:35.960> for<00:05:36.110> the<00:05:36.140> sake<00:05:36.410> of<00:05:36.470> this

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
bit so let's just for the sake of this

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.980 
bit so let's just for the sake of this
video<00:05:37.100> I'm<00:05:37.520> going<00:05:37.760> to<00:05:37.820> move<00:05:38.000> my<00:05:38.390> bright<00:05:38.840> light

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
video I'm going to move my bright light

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.820 
video I'm going to move my bright light
here<00:05:41.990> and<00:05:42.740> you<00:05:42.950> can<00:05:43.100> see<00:05:43.310> in<00:05:43.580> my<00:05:43.730> image<00:05:44.090> I<00:05:44.830> have

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
here and you can see in my image I have

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:52.180 
here and you can see in my image I have
a<00:05:47.770> bright<00:05:48.770> light<00:05:49.480> and<00:05:50.500> the<00:05:51.500> rest<00:05:51.680> of<00:05:51.830> the<00:05:51.920> image

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
a bright light and the rest of the image

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.210 
a bright light and the rest of the image
isn't<00:05:52.850> great<00:05:53.150> so<00:05:53.390> if<00:05:53.600> I<00:05:53.750> tap<00:05:54.470> on<00:05:54.500> my<00:05:54.980> light

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.220 
isn't great so if I tap on my light

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.490 
isn't great so if I tap on my light
there<00:05:55.460> everything<00:05:55.910> else<00:05:56.000> becomes<00:05:56.420> dark<00:05:56.810> by

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
there everything else becomes dark by

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.050 
there everything else becomes dark by
tap<00:05:57.740> on<00:05:57.920> the<00:05:58.040> bank<00:05:58.280> everything<00:05:58.880> else

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.060 
tap on the bank everything else

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.820 
tap on the bank everything else
everything<00:05:59.690> kind<00:05:59.930> of<00:05:59.990> becomes<00:06:00.290> light<00:06:00.530> if<00:06:00.740> I

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:00.830 
everything kind of becomes light if I

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.370 
everything kind of becomes light if I
have<00:06:00.980> HDR<00:06:01.490> on<00:06:01.700> then<00:06:02.540> you'll<00:06:02.660> notice<00:06:02.870> that<00:06:03.230> the

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
have HDR on then you'll notice that the

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.130 
have HDR on then you'll notice that the
final<00:06:03.770> image<00:06:03.950> is<00:06:04.850> actually<00:06:05.600> a<00:06:05.630> lot<00:06:05.930> more

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:06.140 
final image is actually a lot more

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.140 
final image is actually a lot more
balanced<00:06:06.560> than<00:06:06.950> what<00:06:07.160> you<00:06:07.250> may<00:06:07.460> have<00:06:07.640> seen<00:06:07.700> on

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 
balanced than what you may have seen on

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.110 
balanced than what you may have seen on
the<00:06:08.360> camera<00:06:08.750> so<00:06:09.440> that's<00:06:09.620> non<00:06:09.890> HDR<00:06:10.520> that<00:06:10.880> one

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
the camera so that's non HDR that one

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.510 
the camera so that's non HDR that one
and<00:06:11.360> this<00:06:11.690> is<00:06:11.990> with<00:06:12.260> HDR<00:06:12.740> so<00:06:13.010> you<00:06:13.100> can<00:06:13.190> see<00:06:13.370> it's

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
and this is with HDR so you can see it's

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.820 
and this is with HDR so you can see it's
kind<00:06:13.700> of<00:06:13.820> balance<00:06:14.210> it<00:06:14.420> out<00:06:14.510> a<00:06:14.570> lot<00:06:14.780> this<00:06:14.990> change

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
kind of balance it out a lot this change

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.470 
kind of balance it out a lot this change
some<00:06:16.040> of<00:06:16.100> the<00:06:16.160> contrast<00:06:16.670> it's<00:06:16.880> evened<00:06:17.270> it<00:06:17.330> out

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:17.480 
some of the contrast it's evened it out

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.650 
some of the contrast it's evened it out
it's<00:06:17.780> made<00:06:17.990> the<00:06:18.200> colors<00:06:18.560> better<00:06:18.970> and<00:06:19.970> that<00:06:20.480> is

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:20.660 
it's made the colors better and that is

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.810 
it's made the colors better and that is
a<00:06:20.690> really<00:06:21.170> great<00:06:21.440> tool<00:06:21.680> to<00:06:21.740> have<00:06:22.130> within<00:06:22.490> a
