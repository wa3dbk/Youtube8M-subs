00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.860 
today we're going to do an experiment
where<00:00:02.250> we<00:00:02.520> compare<00:00:02.879> how<00:00:03.060> quickly<00:00:03.330> we<00:00:03.570> can<00:00:03.720> have

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
where we compare how quickly we can have

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.079 
where we compare how quickly we can have
a<00:00:03.899> gas<00:00:04.170> grill<00:00:04.470> ready<00:00:04.799> for<00:00:05.040> cooking<00:00:05.160> versus<00:00:06.060> a

ten minutes and this thing will be ready
for<00:00:29.220> cooking<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.789> then<00:00:30.660> we're<00:00:30.779> going<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:30.929> open

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
for cooking and then we're going to open

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.479 
for cooking and then we're going to open
up<00:00:31.320> both<00:00:31.500> grills<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.040> we're<00:00:32.189> going<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.340> do<00:00:32.460> a

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
couple of tests using some fancy testing

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.620 
couple of tests using some fancy testing
equipment<00:00:35.100> we're<00:00:35.760> going<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.940> test<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.329> in<00:00:36.420> two

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
equipment we're going to test it in two

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.080 
equipment we're going to test it in two
ways<00:00:36.840> one<00:00:37.380> we're<00:00:37.829> going<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.010> put<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.219> small<00:00:38.790> pan

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
ways one we're going to put a small pan

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.119 
ways one we're going to put a small pan
on<00:00:39.360> top<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.750> each<00:00:39.870> fire<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.739> then<00:00:40.860> we're<00:00:41.010> going

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
on top of each fire and then we're going

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.889 
on top of each fire and then we're going
to<00:00:41.190> use<00:00:41.340> this<00:00:41.520> tool<00:00:41.790> which<00:00:42.030> measure<00:00:42.300> measures

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
to use this tool which measure measures

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.810 
to use this tool which measure measures
the<00:00:43.050> temperature<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.530> surfaces<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.460> see<00:00:44.640> how

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
the temperature of surfaces to see how

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.000 
the temperature of surfaces to see how
hot<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.239> pan<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.629> getting<00:00:45.829> secondly<00:00:46.829> we're

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
hot the pan is getting secondly we're

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.380 
hot the pan is getting secondly we're
going<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.190> put<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.370> steak<00:00:47.670> on<00:00:47.879> top<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.270> each
