so<00:00:00.329> here<00:00:00.570> on<00:00:00.690> the<00:00:00.840> screen<00:00:01.110> I<00:00:01.140> have<00:00:01.290> my<00:00:01.620> 3d<00:00:02.040> mark

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
so here on the screen I have my 3d mark

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.720 
so here on the screen I have my 3d mark

Twin<00:00:09.330> Frozr<00:00:09.540> 3<00:00:10.080> there's<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:11.190> logo<00:00:11.400> thing<00:00:11.840> so

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
Twin Frozr 3 there's the logo thing so

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.560 
Twin Frozr 3 there's the logo thing so
that's<00:00:13.049> with<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.530> dual<00:00:13.769> 80<00:00:14.549> mil<00:00:14.790> fans<00:00:15.089> you<00:00:15.420> can

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
that's with the dual 80 mil fans you can

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.970 
that's with the dual 80 mil fans you can
see<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.870> hawk<00:00:16.109> logo<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.830> PCB<00:00:17.220> down<00:00:17.609> there

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
see the hawk logo and the PCB down there

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.200 
see the hawk logo and the PCB down there
there<00:00:19.980> it<00:00:20.070> is<00:00:20.220> alright<00:00:21.210> MSI<00:00:21.779> hot<00:00:21.990> ok<00:00:22.830> so

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
there it is alright MSI hot ok so

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.259 
there it is alright MSI hot ok so
basically<00:00:24.529> the<00:00:25.529> max<00:00:26.070> overclock<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:26.820> was<00:00:26.970> able

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
basically the max overclock I was able

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.179 
basically the max overclock I was able
to<00:00:27.300> achieve<00:00:27.539> on<00:00:27.930> this<00:00:28.080> particular<00:00:28.619> card<00:00:28.949> you

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
to achieve on this particular card you

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.310 
to achieve on this particular card you
may<00:00:29.310> use<00:00:29.460> my<00:00:29.760> manual<00:00:30.330> brightness<00:00:31.019> settings

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
may use my manual brightness settings

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.350 
may use my manual brightness settings
area<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.859> can<00:00:32.040> actually<00:00:32.160> read<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.640> now<00:00:32.850> so<00:00:33.329> I

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
area you can actually read that now so I

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.299 
area you can actually read that now so I
was<00:00:33.540> able<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.809> turn<00:00:34.200> up<00:00:34.260> not<00:00:34.620> only<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.040> core

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
was able to turn up not only the core

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.900 
was able to turn up not only the core
voltage<00:00:35.520> but<00:00:36.120> also<00:00:37.010> the<00:00:38.010> memory<00:00:38.219> voltage<00:00:38.730> and

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
voltage but also the memory voltage and

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.490 
voltage but also the memory voltage and
auxilary<00:00:39.239> voltage<00:00:39.750> because<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.320> the

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
auxilary voltage because of the

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.369 
auxilary voltage because of the
non-reference<00:00:41.190> Hawk<00:00:41.670> PCB<00:00:42.360> so<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:42.960> was<00:00:43.140> able<00:00:43.230> to

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
non-reference Hawk PCB so I was able to

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.069 
non-reference Hawk PCB so I was able to
get<00:00:43.500> my<00:00:43.649> core<00:00:44.010> clock<00:00:44.309> up<00:00:44.640> past<00:00:45.210> 1<00:00:45.719> gigahertz

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
get my core clock up past 1 gigahertz

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.380 
get my core clock up past 1 gigahertz
now<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.860> was<00:00:47.129> able<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.399> run<00:00:47.579> benchmarks<00:00:48.149> higher

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
now I was able to run benchmarks higher

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.729 
now I was able to run benchmarks higher
than<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:48.840> up<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.200> about<00:00:50.719> 1.05<00:00:51.719> gigahertz<00:00:52.170> but

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
than this up to about 1.05 gigahertz but

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.910 
than this up to about 1.05 gigahertz but
this<00:00:52.980> was<00:00:53.190> what<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.460> found<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:54.090> be<00:00:54.120> 24/7<00:00:55.050> stable

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
this was what I found to be 24/7 stable

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.130 
this was what I found to be 24/7 stable
okay<00:00:56.670> without<00:00:57.000> temperature's<00:00:57.690> going<00:00:57.719> through

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
okay without temperature's going through

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.750 
okay without temperature's going through
the<00:00:58.230> roof<00:00:58.440> ah<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.949> can't<00:00:59.129> see<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.370> here<00:00:59.520> around

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
the roof ah you can't see it here around

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.279 
the roof ah you can't see it here around
the<00:00:59.940> benchmark<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.390> while<00:01:00.570> ago<00:01:00.809> but<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:00.989> peaks

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
the benchmark a while ago but it peaks

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.450 
the benchmark a while ago but it peaks
at<00:01:01.440> around<00:01:01.530> 70<00:01:02.100> degrees

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
at around 70 degrees

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.119 
at around 70 degrees
okay<00:01:03.180> shader<00:01:03.449> clock<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:04.080> obviously<00:01:04.710> locked<00:01:04.979> in

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
okay shader clock is obviously locked in

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.429 
okay shader clock is obviously locked in
the<00:01:05.189> core<00:01:05.369> clock<00:01:05.610> as<00:01:05.880> with<00:01:06.090> most<00:01:06.450> recent

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
the core clock as with most recent

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.520 
the core clock as with most recent
generation<00:01:07.740> Nvidia<00:01:08.640> cards<00:01:09.030> memory<00:01:09.689> clock<00:01:10.110> you

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
generation Nvidia cards memory clock you

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.050 
generation Nvidia cards memory clock you
know<00:01:10.650> what<00:01:10.799> doesn't<00:01:11.040> have<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.310> huge<00:01:11.580> impact<00:01:11.700> on

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
know what doesn't have a huge impact on

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.760 
know what doesn't have a huge impact on
performance<00:01:12.240> but<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:13.049> as<00:01:13.170> high<00:01:13.320> as<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.619> was

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
performance but this is as high as I was

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.950 
performance but this is as high as I was
able<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.010> get<00:01:14.189> stable<00:01:14.460> like<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.270> said<00:01:15.540> very

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
able to get stable like I said very

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.990 
able to get stable like I said very
little<00:01:16.259> impact<00:01:16.530> on<00:01:16.740> performance<00:01:16.920> though<00:01:17.520> it's

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
little impact on performance though it's

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.399 
little impact on performance though it's
all<00:01:18.150> about<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.570> core<00:01:18.810> clock<00:01:19.049> on<00:01:19.259> this

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
all about the core clock on this

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.649 
all about the core clock on this
particular<00:01:19.920> card<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:20.490> now<00:01:21.030> what<00:01:21.180> I'm<00:01:21.270> gonna<00:01:21.420> do

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
particular card so now what I'm gonna do

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.330 
particular card so now what I'm gonna do
is<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:21.990> actually<00:01:22.110> never<00:01:22.590> even<00:01:22.650> rammed<00:01:23.159> the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
is I actually never even rammed the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.030 
is I actually never even rammed the
benchmark<00:01:25.460> at<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.700> reference<00:01:27.740> clock<00:01:28.740> speeds

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
benchmark at the reference clock speeds

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.679 
benchmark at the reference clock speeds
so<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.340> will<00:01:29.820> go<00:01:29.939> ahead<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.270> run<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.450> at

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
so I will go ahead and run it at

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:31.910 
so I will go ahead and run it at
reference<00:01:31.049> clock<00:01:31.229> speeds<00:01:31.470> which<00:01:31.590> actually

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
reference clock speeds which actually

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.690 
reference clock speeds which actually
aren't<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.189> much<00:01:32.310> lower

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
aren't that much lower

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.569 
aren't that much lower
remember<00:01:33.390> this<00:01:33.509> card<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:33.960> overclocked<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.619> 950

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
remember this card is overclocked to 950

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.670 
remember this card is overclocked to 950
megahertz<00:01:36.090> out<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.390> box<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.350> will<00:01:37.470> find

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
megahertz out of the box and I will find

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.749 
megahertz out of the box and I will find
out<00:01:37.860> how<00:01:38.040> much<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.369> performance

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
out how much of a performance

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.700 
out how much of a performance
improvement<00:01:39.150> we<00:01:39.659> got<00:01:39.840> from<00:01:40.049> overclocking<00:01:40.680> the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
improvement we got from overclocking the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.520 
improvement we got from overclocking the
graphics<00:01:41.130> card<00:01:41.570> ok<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:42.630> there's<00:01:43.020> clearly<00:01:43.140> not

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
graphics card ok so there's clearly not

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.200 
graphics card ok so there's clearly not
much<00:01:43.710> improvement<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:44.430> performance<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:45.180> be

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
much improvement in performance to be

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.340 
much improvement in performance to be
had<00:01:45.479> by<00:01:45.869> overclocking<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.070> GTX<00:01:47.820> 560<00:01:48.350> Hawke

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
had by overclocking the GTX 560 Hawke

definitely<00:01:53.070> some<00:01:53.189> advantages<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.270> so

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
definitely some advantages to it so

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.940 
definitely some advantages to it so
there's<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.020> fact<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.530> doesn't<00:01:55.799> cost

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
there's the fact that it doesn't cost

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.459 
there's the fact that it doesn't cost
that<00:01:56.189> much<00:01:56.399> more<00:01:56.640> than<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.329> regular<00:01:57.719> gtx<00:01:58.200> 560

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
that much more than the regular gtx 560

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.639 
that much more than the regular gtx 560
Twin<00:01:59.070> Frozr<00:01:59.219> -<00:01:59.670> there's<00:02:00.659> also<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.259> fact<00:02:01.500> that

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
Twin Frozr - there's also the fact that

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.880 
Twin Frozr - there's also the fact that
it<00:02:01.950> has<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.460> better<00:02:02.909> PCB<00:02:03.570> which<00:02:03.960> includes<00:02:04.590> I

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
it has a better PCB which includes I

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.100 
it has a better PCB which includes I
mean<00:02:05.340> among<00:02:05.700> other<00:02:05.939> things<00:02:06.030> ok<00:02:06.570> we've<00:02:06.780> got<00:02:06.960> the

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
V checkpoints which are here we've also

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.559 
V checkpoints which are here we've also
got<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:11.660> where<00:02:12.660> is<00:02:12.780> it

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
got the where is it

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.479 
got the where is it
what<00:02:13.900> is<00:02:14.049> this<00:02:14.200> them<00:02:14.439> oh<00:02:14.590> yeah<00:02:14.890> we've<00:02:15.069> got<00:02:15.250> the

what is this them oh yeah we've got the

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.280 
what is this them oh yeah we've got the
different<00:02:16.060> profiles<00:02:16.480> for<00:02:16.719> the<00:02:16.810> fans<00:02:17.049> so<00:02:17.170> you

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
different profiles for the fans so you

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.959 
different profiles for the fans so you
can<00:02:17.530> go<00:02:17.620> to<00:02:17.709> performance<00:02:18.219> motor<00:02:18.400> silent<00:02:18.849> mode

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:18.969 
can go to performance motor silent mode

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:21.599 
can go to performance motor silent mode
for<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.269> fans<00:02:19.510> we've<00:02:20.049> got<00:02:20.349> this<00:02:20.650> rigidity

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:21.609 
for the fans we've got this rigidity

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:24.660 
for the fans we've got this rigidity
plate<00:02:22.150> for<00:02:22.629> the<00:02:22.750> PCB<00:02:23.200> itself<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:24.159> keep<00:02:24.310> it<00:02:24.489> from

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670

one<00:02:28.989> of<00:02:29.079> the<00:02:29.170> other<00:02:29.290> improvements<00:02:29.859> they<00:02:29.980> made

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:30.189 
one of the other improvements they made

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:32.039 
one of the other improvements they made
to<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.430> PCB<00:02:30.790> design<00:02:31.180> is<00:02:31.359> also<00:02:31.599> the<00:02:31.720> fact<00:02:31.930> that

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
to the PCB design is also the fact that

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:33.839 
to the PCB design is also the fact that
the<00:02:32.200> PCIe<00:02:32.590> plugs<00:02:32.980> come<00:02:33.189> out<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.430> top<00:02:33.609> of<00:02:33.760> the

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
the PCIe plugs come out the top of the

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.789 
the PCIe plugs come out the top of the
part<00:02:34.090> rather<00:02:34.720> than<00:02:34.989> the<00:02:35.140> back<00:02:35.290> of<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.560> card

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:37.440 
part rather than the back of the card
which<00:02:35.980> means<00:02:36.250> that<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.519> overall<00:02:36.640> length<00:02:37.239> of

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
which means that the overall length of

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.910 
which means that the overall length of
it<00:02:37.540> is<00:02:37.569> a<00:02:37.689> little<00:02:37.900> bit<00:02:38.049> less<00:02:38.260> you<00:02:38.500> can<00:02:38.650> see<00:02:38.829> the

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
it is a little bit less you can see the

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.550 
it is a little bit less you can see the

overhangs<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.549> PCB<00:02:43.329> a<00:02:43.359> little<00:02:43.629> bit<00:02:43.750> whereas

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
overhangs the PCB a little bit whereas

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.559 
overhangs the PCB a little bit whereas

not<00:02:46.720> do<00:02:46.870> that<00:02:47.019> you<00:02:47.290> get<00:02:47.739> the<00:02:47.920> propeller<00:02:48.689> style

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:49.689 
not do that you get the propeller style

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:52.520 
not do that you get the propeller style
fans<00:02:50.049> rather<00:02:50.950> than<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.459> more<00:02:51.639> traditional

blade<00:02:53.530> fans<00:02:53.919> and<00:02:55.980> yeah<00:02:56.980> and<00:02:57.159> then<00:02:57.310> you<00:02:57.400> get<00:02:57.519> the

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:57.639 
blade fans and yeah and then you get the

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:59.099 
blade fans and yeah and then you get the
factory<00:02:58.000> overclock<00:02:58.419> so<00:02:58.629> since<00:02:58.810> you<00:02:58.930> can't

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
factory overclock so since you can't

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:00.539 
factory overclock so since you can't
push<00:02:59.260> it<00:02:59.290> that<00:02:59.530> much<00:02:59.680> over<00:03:00.099> the<00:03:00.220> factory

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
push it that much over the factory

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:01.890 
push it that much over the factory
overclock<00:03:01.060> that's<00:03:01.269> pretty<00:03:01.480> much<00:03:01.629> to<00:03:01.810> be

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
overclock that's pretty much to be

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.240 
overclock that's pretty much to be
expected<00:03:02.109> we're<00:03:02.530> pretty<00:03:02.709> close<00:03:02.980> to<00:03:03.129> the

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
expected we're pretty close to the

limits of a GTX 560 GPU you still get

that factory overclock which is

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.589 
that factory overclock which is
significantly<00:03:08.200> more<00:03:08.500> than<00:03:08.769> the<00:03:09.340> 560<00:03:09.970> Ti<00:03:10.150> Twin
