00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
spandex one it's not as packed so you

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.579 
spandex one it's not as packed so you
just<00:01:03.120> have<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.420> keep<00:01:03.600> up<00:01:03.809> or<00:01:03.989> adding<00:01:04.350> layers

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.980 
just have to keep up or adding layers
which<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.519> fine<00:01:05.790> because<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.420> means<00:01:07.159> for<00:01:08.159> um

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990
