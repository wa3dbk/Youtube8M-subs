which are produced in green tea but

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.440 
which are produced in green tea but
China<00:01:11.719> is<00:01:11.840> really<00:01:12.140> where<00:01:12.799> in<00:01:13.430> expertise<00:01:14.240> in

China is really where in expertise in
producing<00:01:15.040> green<00:01:16.040> tea<00:01:16.250> lives<00:01:17.530> so<00:01:18.530> how<00:01:19.100> do<00:01:19.159> you

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
producing green tea lives so how do you

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.340 
producing green tea lives so how do you
produce<00:01:19.490> green<00:01:19.969> tea<00:01:20.180> and<00:01:20.600> why<00:01:20.869> is<00:01:20.930> it<00:01:21.110> so

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
produce green tea and why is it so

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.100 
produce green tea and why is it so
different<00:01:21.590> from<00:01:22.159> black<00:01:22.460> tea<00:01:23.049> green<00:01:24.049> tea

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
different from black tea green tea

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.779 
different from black tea green tea
probably<00:01:24.439> was<00:01:24.799> the<00:01:24.950> original<00:01:25.399> tea<00:01:25.610> which<00:01:25.759> was

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:25.789 
probably was the original tea which was

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:29.109 
probably was the original tea which was
imported<00:01:26.479> into<00:01:26.659> the<00:01:26.899> UK<00:01:27.159> in<00:01:28.159> times<00:01:28.670> gone<00:01:28.909> by

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
imported into the UK in times gone by

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:30.370 
imported into the UK in times gone by
and<00:01:29.180> probably<00:01:29.719> the<00:01:29.840> first<00:01:30.049> team<00:01:30.350> that

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
and probably the first team that

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.679 
and probably the first team that
Twinings<00:01:30.890> ever<00:01:31.070> imported<00:01:31.460> and<00:01:32.229> it's

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
Twinings ever imported and it's

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:37.120 
Twinings ever imported and it's
processed<00:01:35.689> in<00:01:35.869> a<00:01:35.899> slightly<00:01:36.170> different<00:01:36.320> way<00:01:36.649> in

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
processed in a slightly different way in

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.209 
processed in a slightly different way in
that<00:01:37.549> it's<00:01:38.210> not<00:01:38.359> allowed<00:01:38.630> to<00:01:38.869> oxidize<00:01:39.500> so<00:01:40.070> it's

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:40.219 
that it's not allowed to oxidize so it's

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:42.300 
that it's not allowed to oxidize so it's
the<00:01:40.340> oxidation<00:01:40.789> process<00:01:41.000> in<00:01:41.539> black<00:01:41.810> tea<00:01:42.049> which

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
the oxidation process in black tea which

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.249 
the oxidation process in black tea which
involves<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:43.430> color<00:01:43.670> change<00:01:44.000> from<00:01:44.359> green

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
involves the color change from green

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.279 
involves the color change from green
leaf<00:01:46.009> to<00:01:46.280> a<00:01:46.310> brown<00:01:46.640> leaf<00:01:46.939> but<00:01:47.719> in<00:01:47.840> green<00:01:48.079> tea

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
leaf to a brown leaf but in green tea

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:50.950 
leaf to a brown leaf but in green tea
that<00:01:48.469> doesn't<00:01:48.890> happen<00:01:49.070> and<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.630> reason<00:01:50.630> that

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
that doesn't happen and the reason that

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.840 
that doesn't happen and the reason that
doesn't<00:01:51.409> happen<00:01:51.530> is<00:01:51.950> because<00:01:52.219> the<00:01:52.340> new<00:01:52.490> leaf

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
doesn't happen is because the new leaf

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.510 
doesn't happen is because the new leaf
has<00:01:53.060> to<00:01:53.179> be<00:01:53.270> gently<00:01:53.600> heated<00:01:54.049> first<00:01:54.380> and<00:01:55.369> this

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
has to be gently heated first and this

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.050 
has to be gently heated first and this
can<00:01:55.700> happen<00:01:55.880> in<00:01:56.060> a<00:01:56.210> couple<00:01:56.600> of<00:01:56.869> different<00:01:57.020> ways

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
can happen in a couple of different ways

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.270 
can happen in a couple of different ways
the<00:01:58.480> most<00:01:58.720> traditional<00:01:58.870> way<00:01:59.710> of<00:01:59.740> doing<00:02:00.010> this

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
the most traditional way of doing this

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.410 
the most traditional way of doing this
is<00:02:00.580> to<00:02:01.060> gently<00:02:01.990> heat<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.560> tea<00:02:02.940> usually<00:02:03.940> in<00:02:04.060> a

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
is to gently heat the tea usually in a

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.540 
is to gently heat the tea usually in a
large<00:02:04.660> wok<00:02:05.910> and<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:08.110> involves<00:02:09.100> quite<00:02:09.280> a<00:02:09.340> lot<00:02:09.520> of

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
large wok and it involves quite a lot of

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.950 
large wok and it involves quite a lot of
skill<00:02:09.850> the<00:02:10.650> the<00:02:11.650> processor<00:02:12.190> will<00:02:12.780> gently<00:02:13.780> move

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
skill the the processor will gently move

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.380 
skill the the processor will gently move
the<00:02:14.170> leaves<00:02:14.380> around<00:02:14.680> in<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.040> wok<00:02:15.250> and<00:02:16.000> keep

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
the leaves around in the wok and keep

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.780 
the leaves around in the wok and keep
them<00:02:16.540> moving<00:02:16.690> so<00:02:16.990> they<00:02:17.110> don't<00:02:17.350> burn<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:18.670> the

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
them moving so they don't burn and the

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.300 
them moving so they don't burn and the
effect<00:02:19.060> this<00:02:19.270> has<00:02:19.330> is<00:02:19.840> to<00:02:19.990> kill<00:02:20.260> things<00:02:21.040> known

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
effect this has is to kill things known

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.510 
effect this has is to kill things known
as<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.550> enzymes<00:02:22.120> in<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.570> leaf<00:02:23.280> which<00:02:24.280> then

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
as the enzymes in the leaf which then

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.970 
as the enzymes in the leaf which then
prepared<00:02:24.940> me<00:02:25.180> for<00:02:25.420> going<00:02:25.959> on<00:02:26.200> to<00:02:26.410> be<00:02:26.560> rolled

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
prepared me for going on to be rolled

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.020 
prepared me for going on to be rolled
and<00:02:27.310> finished<00:02:28.209> process<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:30.250> enzymes<00:02:30.700> in<00:02:30.940> the

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
and finished process the enzymes in the

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.400 
and finished process the enzymes in the
leaf<00:02:31.180> are<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.450> things<00:02:31.660> that<00:02:31.810> react<00:02:32.110> with<00:02:32.230> the

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
leaf are the things that react with the

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.729 
leaf are the things that react with the
oxygen<00:02:32.440> in<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.010> air<00:02:33.130> to<00:02:34.170> oxidate<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.380> the

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
oxygen in the air to oxidate the the

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.610 
oxygen in the air to oxidate the the
leaf<00:02:35.920> and<00:02:36.180> which<00:02:37.180> involve<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.380> color

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
leaf and which involve the the color

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.000 
leaf and which involve the the color
change<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.310> chemical<00:02:39.760> change<00:02:40.060> in<00:02:41.010> black

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
change and the chemical change in black

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.790 
change and the chemical change in black
tea<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.720> other<00:02:43.720> way<00:02:43.900> of<00:02:44.020> doing<00:02:44.140> this<00:02:44.440> is<00:02:44.770> to

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
tea the other way of doing this is to

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.600 
tea the other way of doing this is to
gently<00:02:45.280> heat<00:02:45.550> the<00:02:45.580> me<00:02:45.959> by<00:02:46.959> stealing<00:02:47.320> and<00:02:48.190> this

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
gently heat the me by stealing and this

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.140 
gently heat the me by stealing and this
method<00:02:48.970> is<00:02:49.090> preferred<00:02:49.360> in<00:02:49.780> Japan<00:02:50.459> so<00:02:51.459> the<00:02:51.940> tea

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
method is preferred in Japan so the tea

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.910 
method is preferred in Japan so the tea
is<00:02:52.270> passed<00:02:52.540> through<00:02:52.780> a<00:02:52.810> cylinder<00:02:53.440> with<00:02:53.709> high

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
is passed through a cylinder with high

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.840 
is passed through a cylinder with high
pressure<00:02:54.280> and<00:02:54.550> steam<00:02:55.330> blasting<00:02:56.140> through<00:02:56.380> it

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
pressure and steam blasting through it

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.850 
pressure and steam blasting through it
for<00:02:57.850> only<00:02:58.150> for<00:02:58.330> a<00:02:58.390> matter<00:02:58.600> of<00:02:58.750> seconds<00:02:59.590> and

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
for only for a matter of seconds and

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.610 
for only for a matter of seconds and
this<00:03:00.190> has<00:03:00.340> a<00:03:00.370> similar<00:03:00.820> effect<00:03:01.209> but<00:03:01.900> it<00:03:02.080> just

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
this has a similar effect but it just

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.830 
this has a similar effect but it just
means<00:03:02.769> that<00:03:03.010> the<00:03:03.190> overall<00:03:03.850> taste<00:03:04.090> profile<00:03:04.660> is

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
means that the overall taste profile is

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.900 
means that the overall taste profile is
slightly<00:03:05.230> different<00:03:05.530> and<00:03:06.340> this<00:03:06.489> is<00:03:06.640> what<00:03:06.760> we

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
slightly different and this is what we

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.199 
slightly different and this is what we
refer<00:03:07.030> to<00:03:07.540> as<00:03:07.780> steamed<00:03:08.260> green<00:03:08.620> tea<00:03:09.060> and<00:03:10.060> what

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
refer to as steamed green tea and what

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.289 
refer to as steamed green tea and what
the<00:03:10.299> Japanese<00:03:10.750> refer<00:03:11.200> to<00:03:11.440> as<00:03:12.060> accenture<00:03:13.090> or

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
the Japanese refer to as accenture or

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:18.900 
the Japanese refer to as accenture or
other<00:03:14.230> other<00:03:14.620> manufacture<00:03:15.489> and<00:03:17.340> so<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.700> teas

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
other other manufacture and so the teas

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.570 
other other manufacture and so the teas
that<00:03:19.090> I'm<00:03:19.180> going<00:03:19.360> to<00:03:19.450> talk<00:03:19.630> to<00:03:19.930> today<00:03:20.860> I'm<00:03:21.340> out

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
that I'm going to talk to today I'm out

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.910 
that I'm going to talk to today I'm out
on<00:03:22.500> new<00:03:23.500> range<00:03:24.390> there<00:03:25.390> are<00:03:25.690> two<00:03:26.290> pure<00:03:26.620> green

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
on new range there are two pure green

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.590 
on new range there are two pure green
teas<00:03:27.250> one<00:03:28.239> jasmine

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
teas one jasmine

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.980
