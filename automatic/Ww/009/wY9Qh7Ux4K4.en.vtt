saw<00:00:07.890> a<00:00:08.130> video<00:00:08.400> buying<00:00:08.820> mumbo-jumbo<00:00:09.660> he

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
saw a video buying mumbo-jumbo he

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.759 
saw a video buying mumbo-jumbo he
published<00:00:10.500> a<00:00:10.679> four<00:00:11.040> by<00:00:11.190> four<00:00:12.110> water<00:00:13.110> door<00:00:13.469> and

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
published a four by four water door and

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.510 
published a four by four water door and
I<00:00:14.759> decided<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.509> take<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.199> shot<00:00:16.500> on<00:00:16.800> it<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.220> make

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
I decided to take a shot on it and make

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.439 
I decided to take a shot on it and make
a<00:00:18.240> five<00:00:19.080> by<00:00:19.260> five<00:00:19.470> version<00:00:20.039> so<00:00:20.760> let's<00:00:21.210> check

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
a five by five version so let's check

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.150 
a five by five version so let's check
that<00:00:21.630> out<00:00:21.660> if<00:00:21.990> we<00:00:22.289> press<00:00:22.560> this<00:00:22.710> button<00:00:24.890> we<00:00:25.890> view

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
that out if we press this button we view

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.000 
that out if we press this button we view
this<00:00:26.340> door<00:00:26.609> completely<00:00:27.390> with<00:00:27.660> water<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.500> we

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
this door completely with water and we

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.220 
this door completely with water and we
can<00:00:29.160> have<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.369> look<00:00:29.550> at<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.880> other<00:00:29.910> side<00:00:30.359> here

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
can have a look at the other side here

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.530 
can have a look at the other side here
how<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.560> looks<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.279> if<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:32.850> can<00:00:33.710> hit<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:34.950> button

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
how it looks so if I can hit that button

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.020 
how it looks so if I can hit that button
yeah<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.840> can<00:00:37.020> see<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.559> will<00:00:37.770> piss

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
yeah you can see that it will piss

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.319 
yeah you can see that it will piss
fairly<00:00:39.440> quick<00:00:40.440> as<00:00:40.680> well<00:00:41.219> so<00:00:41.760> let's<00:00:42.090> have<00:00:42.270> a

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
fairly quick as well so let's have a

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.580 
fairly quick as well so let's have a
look<00:00:42.420> once<00:00:42.809> again<00:00:44.270> and<00:00:45.270> then<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.570> can<00:00:45.809> talk<00:00:46.530> to

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
look once again and then I can talk to

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.690 
look once again and then I can talk to
you<00:00:46.800> about<00:00:47.160> some<00:00:47.730> features<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.809> door<00:00:49.050> and

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
you about some features of this door and

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.889 
you about some features of this door and
why<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.760> was<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.390> really<00:00:51.629> fun<00:00:52.140> project<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.890> make

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
why it was a really fun project to make

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.889 
why it was a really fun project to make
so<00:00:55.340> let's<00:00:56.340> talk<00:00:56.579> first<00:00:56.879> about<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.239> dimensions

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
so let's talk first about the dimensions

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.619 
so let's talk first about the dimensions
it's<00:00:58.399> 13<00:00:59.399> wide<00:00:59.730> by<00:01:00.359> 10<00:01:01.109> tall<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:02.390> three<00:01:03.390> deep

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
it's 13 wide by 10 tall and three deep

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.760 
it's 13 wide by 10 tall and three deep
yes<00:01:04.350> those<00:01:05.479> parents<00:01:06.479> blocks<00:01:06.720> here<00:01:06.990> here<00:01:07.560> are

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
yes those parents blocks here here are

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.010 
yes those parents blocks here here are
not<00:01:07.979> necessary<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.270> input<00:01:09.689> can<00:01:09.990> be

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
not necessary and the input can be

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.250 
not necessary and the input can be
connected<00:01:10.409> directly<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:11.280> those<00:01:11.939> sponge<00:01:12.930> bob

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
connected directly to those sponge bob

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.170 
connected directly to those sponge bob
bob<00:01:14.180> to<00:01:15.180> those<00:01:15.390> pouch<00:01:15.810> blocks<00:01:16.680> down<00:01:17.100> there<00:01:17.310> so

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
bob to those pouch blocks down there so

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.580 
bob to those pouch blocks down there so
the<00:01:18.630> first<00:01:19.220> interesting<00:01:20.220> trick<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.229> down<00:01:22.229> here

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
the first interesting trick is down here

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.090 
the first interesting trick is down here
this<00:01:22.920> circuit<00:01:23.790> on<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.720> corner<00:01:25.170> here<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.830> will

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
this circuit on this corner here it will

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.149 
this circuit on this corner here it will
coordinate<00:01:26.700> this<00:01:27.360> piston<00:01:27.869> back<00:01:28.409> down<00:01:28.470> there

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
coordinate this piston back down there

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.060 
coordinate this piston back down there
so<00:01:29.759> let's<00:01:30.000> watch<00:01:30.329> what<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.750> does<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:31.680> will

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
so let's watch what it does it will

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.460 
so let's watch what it does it will
execute<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:33.060> same<00:01:33.210> sequence<00:01:33.750> every<00:01:34.229> time

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
execute the same sequence every time

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.010 
execute the same sequence every time
when<00:01:34.799> opening<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.520> when<00:01:35.880> closing<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.750> this

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
when opening and when closing so this

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.520 
when opening and when closing so this
makes<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.740> very<00:01:37.979> compact

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
makes it very compact

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.810 
makes it very compact
and<00:01:39.650> when<00:01:40.580> this<00:01:40.820> opens<00:01:41.659> you<00:01:42.619> can<00:01:42.830> see<00:01:43.040> that<00:01:43.220> the

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
and when this opens you can see that the

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.450 
and when this opens you can see that the
water<00:01:44.060> in<00:01:44.299> the<00:01:44.330> middle<00:01:44.690> is<00:01:44.810> destroyed<00:01:45.260> by<00:01:45.530> this

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
water in the middle is destroyed by this

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.820 
water in the middle is destroyed by this
simple<00:01:46.850> exchange<00:01:47.270> extension<00:01:48.259> of<00:01:48.290> there<00:01:48.590> in

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
simple exchange extension of there in

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.190 
simple exchange extension of there in
the<00:01:48.920> middle<00:01:49.360> so<00:01:50.680> what<00:01:51.680> happens<00:01:52.750> when<00:01:53.750> the<00:01:53.930> door

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
the middle so what happens when the door

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.310 
the middle so what happens when the door
went<00:01:55.009> is<00:01:55.190> extenders<00:01:55.820> go<00:01:56.119> here<00:01:56.479> they<00:01:57.050> will

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
went is extenders go here they will

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.050 
went is extenders go here they will
destroy<00:01:57.710> all<00:01:57.950> all<00:01:58.909> those<00:01:59.240> water<00:01:59.600> blocks<00:01:59.930> and

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
destroy all all those water blocks and

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.560 
destroy all all those water blocks and
we<00:02:02.060> will<00:02:02.360> have<00:02:02.630> only<00:02:03.170> those<00:02:04.009> blocks<00:02:04.369> here<00:02:04.940> so

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
we will have only those blocks here so

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.140 
we will have only those blocks here so
when<00:02:05.960> they<00:02:06.140> start<00:02:07.989> retracting<00:02:09.340> this<00:02:10.340> will<00:02:11.000> not

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
when they start retracting this will not

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.920 
when they start retracting this will not
be<00:02:11.180> here<00:02:11.540> anymore<00:02:11.840> because<00:02:13.300> this<00:02:14.300> will<00:02:14.600> have

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
be here anymore because this will have

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.290 
be here anymore because this will have
to<00:02:15.140> wait<00:02:15.290> for<00:02:15.560> tix<00:02:16.010> but<00:02:16.250> this<00:02:16.519> will<00:02:16.760> get<00:02:16.940> a<00:02:16.970> post

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
to wait for tix but this will get a post

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.220 
to wait for tix but this will get a post
immediately<00:02:17.660> by<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.500> way<00:02:18.739> i<00:02:18.769> use<00:02:19.160> only<00:02:19.400> two

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
immediately by the way i use only two

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.990 
immediately by the way i use only two
dispensers<00:02:21.230> here<00:02:21.590> with<00:02:21.890> water<00:02:22.190> sources<00:02:22.640> and<00:02:22.910> i

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
dispensers here with water sources and i

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.960 
dispensers here with water sources and i
will<00:02:23.330> explain<00:02:23.600> why<00:02:24.019> in<00:02:24.290> a<00:02:24.380> bit<00:02:24.530> so<00:02:25.340> when<00:02:25.760> it's

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
will explain why in a bit so when it's

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.380 
will explain why in a bit so when it's
at<00:02:26.180> this<00:02:26.600> state<00:02:27.200> it's<00:02:27.640> basically<00:02:28.640> like<00:02:28.850> like

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
at this state it's basically like like

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.020 
at this state it's basically like like
this<00:02:29.600> and<00:02:29.900> when<00:02:30.769> it<00:02:30.920> finally<00:02:31.030> retracts

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
this and when it finally retracts

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.120 
this and when it finally retracts
everything<00:02:33.790> it's<00:02:34.790> it<00:02:35.470> it<00:02:36.470> will<00:02:36.709> be<00:02:36.890> in<00:02:36.980> this

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
everything it's it it will be in this

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
everything it's it it will be in this
state<00:02:37.459> so<00:02:38.030> with<00:02:38.269> water<00:02:38.569> blocks<00:02:39.110> like<00:02:39.350> this<00:02:39.380> and

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
state so with water blocks like this and

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.530 
state so with water blocks like this and
when<00:02:41.150> we<00:02:41.330> put<00:02:41.600> one<00:02:41.870> solid<00:02:42.290> block<00:02:42.530> here<00:02:43.540> this

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
when we put one solid block here this

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.220 
when we put one solid block here this
this<00:02:45.230> what<00:02:45.829> this<00:02:46.360> this<00:02:47.360> water<00:02:47.720> block<00:02:48.049> should

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
this what this this water block should

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.860 
this what this this water block should
be<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.560> main<00:02:48.680> block<00:02:48.950> because<00:02:49.310> it<00:02:49.670> has<00:02:49.880> water

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
be the main block because it has water

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.039 
be the main block because it has water
flowing<00:02:51.380> out<00:02:51.560> of<00:02:51.590> it<00:02:51.890> and<00:02:52.130> into<00:02:52.549> it<00:02:53.180> so<00:02:53.780> when<00:02:53.930> we

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
flowing out of it and into it so when we

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.199 
flowing out of it and into it so when we
put<00:02:54.079> a<00:02:54.530> solid<00:02:55.220> block<00:02:55.310> here<00:02:55.640> all<00:02:55.790> these<00:02:56.060> vlogs

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
put a solid block here all these vlogs

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.380 
put a solid block here all these vlogs
will<00:02:56.720> disappear<00:02:57.170> immediately<00:02:57.549> let's<00:02:58.549> see

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.080 

oops<00:03:02.390> let's<00:03:02.750> see<00:03:02.930> it<00:03:03.019> now<00:03:03.730> as<00:03:04.730> you<00:03:04.909> can<00:03:05.030> see

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
oops let's see it now as you can see

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.920 
oops let's see it now as you can see
it's<00:03:05.569> really<00:03:05.930> fast<00:03:06.260> and<00:03:06.500> if<00:03:07.400> I<00:03:07.849> now<00:03:08.120> remove

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
it's really fast and if I now remove

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.660 
it's really fast and if I now remove
this<00:03:09.230> phone<00:03:09.530> here<00:03:09.890> you<00:03:10.189> can<00:03:10.489> see<00:03:10.640> the

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
this phone here you can see the

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.500 
this phone here you can see the
difference<00:03:11.620> it<00:03:12.620> closes<00:03:13.180> exactly<00:03:14.180> the<00:03:14.299> same

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
difference it closes exactly the same

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.720 
difference it closes exactly the same
way<00:03:14.689> but<00:03:14.750> now<00:03:15.200> this<00:03:15.379> block<00:03:15.650> will<00:03:15.680> not<00:03:16.129> rise<00:03:16.430> up

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
way but now this block will not rise up

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.140 
way but now this block will not rise up
and<00:03:16.939> you<00:03:17.659> will<00:03:17.780> see<00:03:17.989> what<00:03:18.109> happens<00:03:18.790> so<00:03:19.790> yeah

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
and you will see what happens so yeah

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.940 
and you will see what happens so yeah
the<00:03:20.359> water<00:03:20.510> will<00:03:20.840> be<00:03:20.930> spread<00:03:21.170> here<00:03:21.500> and<00:03:21.739> it

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
the water will be spread here and it

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.280 
the water will be spread here and it
will<00:03:22.159> take<00:03:22.340> longer<00:03:22.760> for<00:03:23.120> the<00:03:23.450> opening<00:03:23.780> so<00:03:23.959> this

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
will take longer for the opening so this

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.899 
will take longer for the opening so this
helps<00:03:25.250> the<00:03:25.489> machine<00:03:25.790> work<00:03:26.329> a<00:03:26.569> little<00:03:26.840> faster

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:27.909 
helps the machine work a little faster

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:31.559 
helps the machine work a little faster
also<00:03:28.909> what<00:03:29.569> happens<00:03:30.049> here<00:03:30.620> on<00:03:30.769> the<00:03:30.889> top<00:03:31.159> is

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
also what happens here on the top is

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:37.360 
also what happens here on the top is
actually<00:03:32.569> very<00:03:32.599> interesting<00:03:33.489> so<00:03:35.950> let<00:03:36.950> me<00:03:36.980> see

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
actually very interesting so let me see

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.860 
actually very interesting so let me see
how<00:03:37.549> am<00:03:37.790> I<00:03:38.000> going<00:03:38.239> to<00:03:38.389> explain<00:03:38.480> it<00:03:39.579> this<00:03:40.870> this

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
how am I going to explain it this this

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.229 
how am I going to explain it this this
dispenser<00:03:42.470> in<00:03:42.799> the<00:03:42.919> middle<00:03:43.189> I<00:03:43.370> I<00:03:43.400> decided<00:03:44.030> not

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
dispenser in the middle I I decided not

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.479 
dispenser in the middle I I decided not
to<00:03:44.419> include<00:03:44.540> it<00:03:44.989> because<00:03:45.200> it<00:03:45.859> really<00:03:46.129> doesn't

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
to include it because it really doesn't

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.429 
to include it because it really doesn't
make<00:03:46.579> the<00:03:46.730> difference<00:03:46.969> it<00:03:47.719> can't<00:03:48.019> make<00:03:48.260> the

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:48.439 
make the difference it can't make the

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:51.849 
make the difference it can't make the
door<00:03:48.650> operate<00:03:49.280> any<00:03:49.609> faster<00:03:50.239> when<00:03:51.139> opening<00:03:51.650> or

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859 
door operate any faster when opening or

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:55.470 
door operate any faster when opening or
closing<00:03:52.120> but<00:03:53.120> sorry<00:03:53.629> guys<00:03:53.840> my<00:03:53.870> computer<00:03:54.560> froze

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
closing but sorry guys my computer froze

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.140 
closing but sorry guys my computer froze
but<00:03:56.480> they<00:03:57.109> will<00:03:57.349> start<00:03:57.680> make<00:03:58.400> the<00:03:58.549> water<00:03:58.790> flow

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
but they will start make the water flow

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.699 
but they will start make the water flow
like<00:04:00.019> so<00:04:00.439> and<00:04:01.510> for<00:04:02.510> some<00:04:02.750> reason<00:04:02.829> sometimes

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
like so and for some reason sometimes

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.670 
like so and for some reason sometimes
this<00:04:06.709> water<00:04:07.519> sources<00:04:08.079> they<00:04:09.079> will<00:04:09.290> be<00:04:09.349> spread

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
this water sources they will be spread

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.360 
this water sources they will be spread
either<00:04:10.220> to<00:04:10.729> this<00:04:10.909> side<00:04:11.209> or<00:04:11.709> on<00:04:12.709> this<00:04:13.099> side<00:04:13.340> so

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
either to this side or on this side so

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.819 
either to this side or on this side so
this<00:04:13.879> column<00:04:14.840> in<00:04:14.989> the<00:04:15.079> middle<00:04:15.349> will<00:04:15.560> always

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829 
this column in the middle will always

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:18.759 
this column in the middle will always
appear<00:04:16.130> here<00:04:16.400> but<00:04:16.940> it's<00:04:17.329> not<00:04:18.049> for<00:04:18.320> sure<00:04:18.380> that

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
appear here but it's not for sure that

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.879 
appear here but it's not for sure that
we<00:04:18.919> will<00:04:19.070> have<00:04:19.099> a<00:04:19.250> column<00:04:19.669> of<00:04:19.789> water<00:04:19.849> here<00:04:20.449> or

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
we will have a column of water here or

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:25.390 
we will have a column of water here or
here<00:04:21.889> so<00:04:22.610> this<00:04:23.389> makes<00:04:23.690> those<00:04:24.560> pistons<00:04:25.070> on<00:04:25.280> the

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
here so this makes those pistons on the

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.430 
here so this makes those pistons on the
side<00:04:25.610> very<00:04:25.880> special<00:04:26.479> because<00:04:26.990> when<00:04:27.289> they

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
side very special because when they

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.820 
side very special because when they
extend<00:04:28.130> they<00:04:28.699> will<00:04:29.150> whoops<00:04:29.810> they<00:04:30.380> will<00:04:30.530> touch

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
extend they will whoops they will touch

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.370 
extend they will whoops they will touch
the<00:04:31.130> water<00:04:31.610> sources<00:04:32.060> here<00:04:32.449> and<00:04:32.599> cause<00:04:33.199> an

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
the water sources here and cause an

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.610 
the water sources here and cause an
update<00:04:33.740> to<00:04:33.979> it<00:04:34.099> so<00:04:34.310> it<00:04:34.550> will<00:04:34.759> start<00:04:35.030> flowing<00:04:35.620> so

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
update to it so it will start flowing so

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.590 
update to it so it will start flowing so
if<00:04:36.770> I<00:04:36.919> remove<00:04:37.280> those<00:04:37.880> pistols<00:04:38.360> now

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
if I remove those pistols now

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.490 
if I remove those pistols now
you<00:04:40.320> will<00:04:40.500> see<00:04:40.710> what<00:04:40.920> happens<00:04:41.960> can<00:04:42.960> break<00:04:43.260> this

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
you will see what happens can break this

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.110 
you will see what happens can break this
all<00:04:43.980> right<00:04:44.400> let's<00:04:44.670> whoops<00:04:45.240> let's<00:04:45.600> see<00:04:45.990> it

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.170 

yeah<00:04:49.120> so<00:04:49.479> it's<00:04:49.780> sort<00:04:50.289> of<00:04:50.439> random<00:04:51.009> like<00:04:51.490> now

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
yeah so it's sort of random like now

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.679 
yeah so it's sort of random like now
it's<00:04:52.509> updated<00:04:53.349> on<00:04:53.620> this<00:04:53.949> side<00:04:54.219> but<00:04:54.669> not<00:04:54.939> on

00:04:55.679 --> 00:04:55.689 
it's updated on this side but not on

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:58.830 
it's updated on this side but not on
this<00:04:55.900> side<00:04:56.169> but<00:04:56.889> if<00:04:57.129> we<00:04:57.939> had<00:04:58.150> an<00:04:58.300> extension

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
this side but if we had an extension

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.559 
this side but if we had an extension
here<00:04:59.229> when<00:05:00.129> it<00:05:00.280> retracted<00:05:00.789> when<00:05:01.270> we<00:05:01.449> were

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:01.569 
here when it retracted when we were

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:04.260 
here when it retracted when we were
affected<00:05:02.050> it<00:05:02.259> will<00:05:02.530> update<00:05:02.759> the<00:05:03.759> water<00:05:03.939> source

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
affected it will update the water source

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.409 
affected it will update the water source
and<00:05:04.509> it<00:05:04.810> will<00:05:04.990> cover<00:05:05.530> up<00:05:05.800> everything<00:05:06.039> and<00:05:06.520> this

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
and it will cover up everything and this

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:10.230 
and it will cover up everything and this
is<00:05:07.750> actually<00:05:07.990> more<00:05:08.409> efficient<00:05:09.159> than<00:05:09.490> having

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
is actually more efficient than having

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.040 
is actually more efficient than having
all<00:05:11.080> five<00:05:11.469> spacers<00:05:12.159> here<00:05:12.490> because<00:05:13.090> if<00:05:13.389> I<00:05:13.599> had<00:05:13.840> a

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
all five spacers here because if I had a

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.390 
all five spacers here because if I had a
spacer<00:05:14.710> here<00:05:15.419> exactly<00:05:16.419> here<00:05:16.889> it<00:05:17.889> would<00:05:18.189> need

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
spacer here exactly here it would need

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.200 
spacer here exactly here it would need
to<00:05:18.699> wait<00:05:19.569> for<00:05:19.599> this<00:05:20.229> these<00:05:21.009> extenders<00:05:21.849> to

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
to wait for this these extenders to

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.749 
to wait for this these extenders to
retract<00:05:22.569> and<00:05:22.930> it<00:05:23.830> would<00:05:24.099> create<00:05:24.400> a<00:05:24.490> water

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:24.759 
retract and it would create a water

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:26.399 
retract and it would create a water
source<00:05:25.060> here<00:05:25.419> and<00:05:25.569> this<00:05:25.900> water<00:05:26.139> source

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:26.409 
source here and this water source

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:29.040 
source here and this water source
footage<00:05:26.680> flow<00:05:27.370> here<00:05:27.610> here<00:05:28.300> and<00:05:28.419> they<00:05:28.719> start

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
footage flow here here and they start

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.740 
footage flow here here and they start
going<00:05:29.229> down<00:05:29.560> but<00:05:30.400> since<00:05:30.969> we<00:05:31.150> already<00:05:31.330> have

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
going down but since we already have

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.170 
going down but since we already have
this<00:05:32.110> dispenser<00:05:32.529> here<00:05:32.889> it's<00:05:33.310> faster<00:05:33.819> to<00:05:33.969> just

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
this dispenser here it's faster to just

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.320 
this dispenser here it's faster to just
start<00:05:34.840> flowing<00:05:35.199> like<00:05:35.349> so<00:05:35.620> and<00:05:35.969> this<00:05:36.969> marked

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
start flowing like so and this marked

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.719 
start flowing like so and this marked
way<00:05:37.479> to<00:05:37.539> to<00:05:38.409> deal<00:05:38.590> with<00:05:38.770> that<00:05:38.949> was<00:05:39.219> just<00:05:39.460> simply

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:39.729 
way to to deal with that was just simply

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:42.029 
way to to deal with that was just simply
calls<00:05:40.000> on<00:05:40.240> update<00:05:40.569> to<00:05:40.779> this<00:05:40.930> water<00:05:41.139> source<00:05:41.500> so

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 
calls on update to this water source so

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:45.510 
calls on update to this water source so
it<00:05:42.069> would<00:05:42.580> work<00:05:42.969> in<00:05:43.270> any<00:05:43.689> direction<00:05:44.370> with<00:05:45.370> the

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
it would work in any direction with the

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.749 
it would work in any direction with the
water<00:05:45.699> flowing<00:05:46.180> at<00:05:46.389> the<00:05:46.659> same<00:05:46.870> speed<00:05:47.610> so<00:05:48.610> let

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:48.759 
water flowing at the same speed so let

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:53.369 
water flowing at the same speed so let
me<00:05:48.789> fix<00:05:49.539> this<00:05:49.840> now<00:05:50.610> yeah<00:05:51.610> and<00:05:52.050> try<00:05:53.050> it<00:05:53.110> once

00:05:53.369 --> 00:05:53.379 
me fix this now yeah and try it once

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:55.350 
me fix this now yeah and try it once
again

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
again

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.089 
again
yes<00:05:56.360> so<00:05:56.569> as<00:05:56.870> you<00:05:56.960> can<00:05:57.080> see<00:05:57.259> it's<00:05:57.380> very<00:05:57.440> compact

00:05:58.089 --> 00:05:58.099 
yes so as you can see it's very compact

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:03.370 
yes so as you can see it's very compact
only<00:05:58.729> 30<00:05:59.000> wide<00:05:59.210> it<00:05:59.509> works<00:06:01.300> in<00:06:02.300> a<00:06:02.900> very<00:06:03.050> simple

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
only 30 wide it works in a very simple

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.089 
only 30 wide it works in a very simple
way<00:06:03.819> when<00:06:04.819> i<00:06:04.849> had<00:06:05.150> my<00:06:05.569> four<00:06:06.050> by<00:06:06.199> four<00:06:06.500> water

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:07.099 
way when i had my four by four water

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:11.200 
way when i had my four by four water
door<00:06:07.400> those<00:06:09.280> pressure<00:06:10.280> plates<00:06:10.639> could<00:06:10.819> be<00:06:11.000> used

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
door those pressure plates could be used

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.809 
door those pressure plates could be used
as<00:06:11.509> input<00:06:12.020> and<00:06:12.259> as<00:06:12.949> you<00:06:13.069> can<00:06:13.220> see<00:06:13.250> they're<00:06:13.550> very

00:06:13.809 --> 00:06:13.819 
as input and as you can see they're very

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:16.689 
as input and as you can see they're very
close<00:06:14.120> to<00:06:14.479> the<00:06:14.509> input<00:06:14.780> line<00:06:15.259> but<00:06:15.979> the<00:06:16.250> problem

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:16.699 
close to the input line but the problem

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:18.850 
close to the input line but the problem
now<00:06:16.849> is<00:06:16.910> that<00:06:17.150> we<00:06:17.509> have<00:06:17.750> this<00:06:18.229> pistol<00:06:18.740> in<00:06:18.830> the

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:18.860 
now is that we have this pistol in the

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.939 
now is that we have this pistol in the
middle<00:06:19.220> so<00:06:19.550> if<00:06:20.210> i<00:06:20.449> was<00:06:21.080> to<00:06:21.139> use<00:06:21.410> a<00:06:21.440> solid<00:06:21.830> block

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:21.949 
middle so if i was to use a solid block

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:25.990 
middle so if i was to use a solid block
below<00:06:23.020> this<00:06:24.020> pressure<00:06:24.349> plate<00:06:24.680> it<00:06:25.280> would<00:06:25.639> lock

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 
below this pressure plate it would lock

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.559 
below this pressure plate it would lock
the<00:06:26.770> pistol<00:06:27.770> here<00:06:28.009> as<00:06:28.130> you<00:06:28.550> can<00:06:28.580> see<00:06:28.729> if<00:06:29.120> i<00:06:29.389> use

00:06:29.559 --> 00:06:29.569 
the pistol here as you can see if i use

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:33.939 
the pistol here as you can see if i use
a<00:06:29.870> slab<00:06:30.139> it<00:06:30.380> doesn't<00:06:30.800> happen<00:06:31.039> I<00:06:32.740> can't<00:06:33.740> stand

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:33.949 
a slab it doesn't happen I can't stand

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:36.040 
a slab it doesn't happen I can't stand
on<00:06:34.130> top<00:06:34.310> of<00:06:34.520> this<00:06:34.669> and<00:06:34.729> still<00:06:35.449> this<00:06:35.780> once

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.050 
on top of this and still this once

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.469 
on top of this and still this once
capable<00:06:36.590> of<00:06:36.650> attracting<00:06:36.949> so<00:06:37.759> it<00:06:38.000> means<00:06:38.240> that

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:38.479 
capable of attracting so it means that

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:41.140 
capable of attracting so it means that
we<00:06:38.509> could<00:06:38.930> have<00:06:39.169> some<00:06:39.470> pistols<00:06:39.919> or<00:06:40.159> even

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.150 
we could have some pistols or even

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.430 
we could have some pistols or even
hopper<00:06:42.050> droppers<00:06:42.530> here<00:06:42.949> and<00:06:43.810> then<00:06:44.810> we<00:06:45.110> be<00:06:45.289> able

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 
hopper droppers here and then we be able

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.939 
hopper droppers here and then we be able
to<00:06:45.560> make<00:06:45.800> this<00:06:46.069> line<00:06:47.030> as<00:06:47.300> an<00:06:47.479> input<00:06:47.840> I<00:06:48.080> don't

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:48.949 
to make this line as an input I don't

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:51.399 
to make this line as an input I don't
know<00:06:49.039> I'm<00:06:49.310> not<00:06:49.490> sure<00:06:49.669> if<00:06:49.970> this<00:06:50.210> if<00:06:50.930> anyone

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:51.409 
know I'm not sure if this if anyone

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:54.430 
know I'm not sure if this if anyone
would<00:06:51.650> want<00:06:51.919> that<00:06:52.009> and<00:06:52.370> also<00:06:53.150> yeah<00:06:53.599> this<00:06:54.229> is<00:06:54.409> a

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:54.440 
would want that and also yeah this is a

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.010 
would want that and also yeah this is a
quick<00:06:54.740> video<00:06:55.009> as<00:06:55.340> I<00:06:55.490> told<00:06:55.669> you<00:06:55.819> I<00:06:56.210> just<00:06:56.330> wanted

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:57.020 
quick video as I told you I just wanted

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.290 
quick video as I told you I just wanted
to<00:06:57.199> talk<00:06:57.380> about<00:06:57.620> this<00:06:58.159> circuit<00:06:58.610> and<00:06:58.880> if<00:06:59.180> you

00:06:59.290 --> 00:06:59.300 
to talk about this circuit and if you

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.700 
to talk about this circuit and if you
guys<00:06:59.449> are<00:06:59.599> interested<00:06:59.870> I<00:07:00.289> can<00:07:00.349> make<00:07:00.680> a

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:00.710 
guys are interested I can make a

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.820 
guys are interested I can make a
tutorial<00:07:01.130> for<00:07:01.430> you<00:07:01.969> but<00:07:02.419> yeah<00:07:03.169> this<00:07:03.380> is<00:07:03.560> more

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:03.830 
tutorial for you but yeah this is more

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.670 
tutorial for you but yeah this is more
of<00:07:03.860> a<00:07:04.490> proof<00:07:04.969> of<00:07:05.090> concept<00:07:05.300> of<00:07:05.719> course<00:07:06.229> it<00:07:06.409> works

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:06.680 
of a proof of concept of course it works

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.640 
of a proof of concept of course it works
with<00:07:06.919> wooden<00:07:07.639> bottles<00:07:08.060> as<00:07:08.330> well<00:07:08.599> so<00:07:09.289> yeah<00:07:09.590> I

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:09.650 
with wooden bottles as well so yeah I

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.490 
with wooden bottles as well so yeah I
think<00:07:09.770> it's<00:07:10.159> a<00:07:10.280> nice<00:07:10.550> design<00:07:11.030> google<00:07:11.690> one<00:07:11.870> to

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:12.500 
think it's a nice design google one to

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.439 
think it's a nice design google one to
have<00:07:12.680> and<00:07:12.979> also<00:07:13.370> this<00:07:13.669> circuit<00:07:14.090> here<00:07:14.949> this<00:07:15.949> is

00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:16.449 
have and also this circuit here this is

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:20.140 
have and also this circuit here this is
what<00:07:17.449> it<00:07:17.599> does<00:07:17.810> is<00:07:18.080> simple<00:07:18.650> but<00:07:18.860> it's<00:07:19.280> i<00:07:19.669> find

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:20.150 
what it does is simple but it's i find

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:21.939 
what it does is simple but it's i find
it<00:07:20.300> complicated<00:07:20.900> to<00:07:21.110> explain<00:07:21.169> how<00:07:21.770> it<00:07:21.919> works

00:07:21.939 --> 00:07:21.949 
it complicated to explain how it works

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:25.390 
it complicated to explain how it works
without<00:07:22.810> breaking<00:07:23.810> the<00:07:23.900> machine<00:07:24.229> so<00:07:24.530> if<00:07:25.190> i

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:25.400 
without breaking the machine so if i

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.219 
without breaking the machine so if i
make<00:07:25.580> a<00:07:25.610> tutorial<00:07:26.000> on<00:07:26.330> this<00:07:26.389> i<00:07:26.810> will<00:07:27.050> have<00:07:27.199> the
