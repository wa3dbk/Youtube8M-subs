over<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.430> lens<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.880> this<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.299> what<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:03.600> does

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
over the lens of this and what this does

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.529 
over the lens of this and what this does
is<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.409> eliminates<00:02:04.680> jello<00:02:05.670> completely<00:02:08.539> also

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
is it eliminates jello completely also

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.610 
is it eliminates jello completely also
it<00:02:10.289> has<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:11.009> slot<00:02:12.000> for<00:02:12.030> an<00:02:12.480> SD<00:02:12.599> card<00:02:12.870> for<00:02:13.290> mic

it has a slot for an SD card for mic
SD<00:02:13.920> card<00:02:14.220> so<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.549> records<00:02:15.120> as<00:02:15.959> you<00:02:16.260> can<00:02:16.440> see<00:02:16.620> I

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
SD card so it records as you can see I

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.630 
SD card so it records as you can see I
have<00:02:17.069> a<00:02:17.099> two<00:02:17.340> axis<00:02:17.730> gimbal<00:02:19.129> or<00:02:20.129> actually<00:02:20.519> it's

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
have a two axis gimbal or actually it's

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.720 
have a two axis gimbal or actually it's
it<00:02:21.000> was<00:02:21.420> a<00:02:21.450> two<00:02:21.750> axis<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.470> I<00:02:22.709> made<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.069> one<00:02:23.280> axis

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
it was a two axis and I made it one axis

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.660 
it was a two axis and I made it one axis
and<00:02:23.879> inside<00:02:24.840> this<00:02:25.080> compartment<00:02:25.799> here<00:02:26.010> there

are<00:02:26.819> two<00:02:27.060> plugins<00:02:27.390> that<00:02:27.930> will<00:02:28.110> actually

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
are two plugins that will actually

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.850 
are two plugins that will actually
operate<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:29.340> servo<00:02:30.060> gimbal<00:02:30.540> well<00:02:31.440> I<00:02:31.470> didn't

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
operate a servo gimbal well I didn't

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.360 
operate a servo gimbal well I didn't
care<00:02:32.129> too<00:02:32.519> much<00:02:32.549> about<00:02:33.319> leveling<00:02:34.319> in<00:02:34.560> role<00:02:35.040> but

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
care too much about leveling in role but

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.680 
care too much about leveling in role but
I<00:02:35.400> wanted<00:02:35.970> it<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.750> level<00:02:37.049> in<00:02:37.819> tilt<00:02:38.819> because

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
I wanted it to level in tilt because

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.119 
I wanted it to level in tilt because

another big modification you want to do

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.009 
another big modification you want to do
is<00:02:58.799> the<00:02:59.129> longer<00:02:59.609> landing<00:03:00.120> gear<00:03:00.359> horizon

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
is the longer landing gear horizon

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.750 
is the longer landing gear horizon
hobbies<00:03:01.440> not<00:03:01.709> come<00:03:02.010> out<00:03:02.099> with<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.400> longer

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
hobbies not come out with the longer

hobbies not come out with the longer
landing<00:03:03.180> gear<00:03:03.950> you<00:03:04.950> don't<00:03:05.129> have<00:03:05.280> to<00:03:05.430> worry

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
landing gear you don't have to worry

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.880 
landing gear you don't have to worry
about<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:06.000> wire<00:03:06.209> on<00:03:06.599> your<00:03:06.989> compass<00:03:07.440> being<00:03:07.680> too

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
about the wire on your compass being too

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.399 
about the wire on your compass being too
short<00:03:08.129> because<00:03:08.579> it<00:03:08.730> changes<00:03:09.209> the<00:03:09.450> mounting

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409 
short because it changes the mounting

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:12.530 
short because it changes the mounting
point<00:03:10.650> they'll<00:03:11.129> bolt<00:03:11.340> right<00:03:11.609> on<00:03:11.819> perfect

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540

point they'll bolt right on perfect
setup<00:03:13.730> now<00:03:14.730> another<00:03:15.030> thing<00:03:15.150> that<00:03:15.720> I<00:03:16.200> would

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
setup now another thing that I would

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.300 
setup now another thing that I would
highly<00:03:16.709> suggest<00:03:16.950> is<00:03:17.760> a<00:03:18.540> good<00:03:19.109> battery<00:03:19.829> alarm

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
highly suggest is a good battery alarm

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.640 
highly suggest is a good battery alarm
this<00:03:20.549> kicks<00:03:20.880> in<00:03:21.090> at<00:03:21.269> three<00:03:21.480> point<00:03:21.720> five<00:03:21.989> volts

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
this kicks in at three point five volts

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.129 
this kicks in at three point five volts
give<00:03:23.280> you<00:03:23.370> plenty<00:03:23.639> of<00:03:23.849> time<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.090> land<00:03:24.540> or<00:03:24.900> hit

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
give you plenty of time to land or hit

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
to the transmitter this came as the RTF

package with the with the DX five and

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.430 
package with the with the DX five and
the<00:03:43.709> DX<00:03:43.949> five<00:03:44.220> means<00:03:44.639> a<00:03:44.790> good<00:03:44.970> radio<00:03:45.440> but

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
the DX five means a good radio but

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.119 
the DX five means a good radio but
here's<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:46.919> Cadillac<00:03:47.489> the<00:03:47.849> DX<00:03:48.180> eight<00:03:48.889> has<00:03:49.889> so

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
here's the Cadillac the DX eight has so

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.580 
here's the Cadillac the DX eight has so
many<00:03:50.310> more<00:03:50.669> functions<00:03:51.090> you<00:03:51.750> can<00:03:51.900> dial<00:03:52.169> an<00:03:52.379> X

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
many more functions you can dial an X

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.890 
many more functions you can dial an X
but<00:03:52.829> you<00:03:53.160> can<00:03:53.310> give<00:03:53.430> it<00:03:53.549> more<00:03:53.760> can<00:03:54.090> control

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
but you can give it more can control

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.619 
but you can give it more can control
more<00:03:55.169> throws<00:03:55.560> as<00:03:55.949> dual<00:03:56.160> rates<00:03:56.519> actually<00:03:57.209> has

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
more throws as dual rates actually has

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:00.220 
more throws as dual rates actually has
triple<00:03:58.049> rates<00:03:58.260> which<00:03:58.620> I<00:03:58.949> really<00:03:59.519> like<00:03:59.760> and

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
triple rates which I really like and

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.830 
triple rates which I really like and
another<00:04:01.230> great<00:04:01.530> thing<00:04:01.590> about<00:04:01.949> this<00:04:02.370> is<00:04:02.840> you

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
another great thing about this is you

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.379 
another great thing about this is you
don't<00:04:03.989> have<00:04:04.139> to<00:04:04.590> use<00:04:04.799> the<00:04:05.010> trim<00:04:05.340> to<00:04:06.000> shut<00:04:06.239> the

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389 
don't have to use the trim to shut the

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:10.210 
don't have to use the trim to shut the
motors<00:04:06.720> off<00:04:07.250> you<00:04:08.250> do<00:04:08.459> the<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:09.449> flick<00:04:09.720> the

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
motors off you do the the flick the

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.280 
motors off you do the the flick the
throw<00:04:11.220> out<00:04:11.280> or<00:04:11.549> the<00:04:11.790> rudder<00:04:12.209> to<00:04:12.840> start<00:04:13.139> the

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
throw out or the rudder to start the

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.439 
throw out or the rudder to start the
motors<00:04:13.650> and<00:04:13.889> then<00:04:14.579> when<00:04:14.790> it<00:04:14.879> lands<00:04:15.120> if<00:04:15.359> you

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:15.449 
motors and then when it lands if you

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:17.330 
motors and then when it lands if you
want<00:04:15.599> to<00:04:15.720> shut<00:04:15.870> them<00:04:16.049> off<00:04:16.260> you<00:04:16.859> just<00:04:17.039> hit<00:04:17.220> the

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
want to shut them off you just hit the

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.890 
want to shut them off you just hit the
trainer<00:04:17.579> button<00:04:17.910> and<00:04:18.060> just<00:04:18.209> look<00:04:18.510> and<00:04:18.750> it<00:04:18.870> just

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
trainer button and just look and it just

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.890 
trainer button and just look and it just
shuts<00:04:19.320> right<00:04:19.560> off<00:04:19.829> so<00:04:20.760> you<00:04:21.419> don't<00:04:21.449> have<00:04:21.630> to

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
shuts right off so you don't have to

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:22.700 
shuts right off so you don't have to
mess<00:04:22.109> with<00:04:22.140> any

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
mess with any

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.390 
mess with any
thing<00:04:22.860> especially<00:04:23.789> in<00:04:24.270> your<00:04:24.419> flying<00:04:24.660> fpv<00:04:25.410> it

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
thing especially in your flying fpv it

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.990 
thing especially in your flying fpv it
really<00:04:26.910> simplifies<00:04:27.660> matters<00:04:28.669> because<00:04:29.669> you

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
really simplifies matters because you

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.490 
really simplifies matters because you
know<00:04:30.090> you<00:04:30.150> might<00:04:30.449> have<00:04:30.479> your<00:04:30.810> goggles<00:04:31.080> on<00:04:31.470> and

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
know you might have your goggles on and

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.200 
know you might have your goggles on and
you<00:04:31.860> can't<00:04:32.130> see<00:04:32.370> the<00:04:32.520> cloud<00:04:32.729> and<00:04:33.000> you<00:04:33.060> know

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
you can't see the cloud and you know

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.330 
you can't see the cloud and you know
that<00:04:33.599> this<00:04:34.050> kills<00:04:34.349> it<00:04:34.530> you're<00:04:34.680> not<00:04:34.889> fumbling

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
that this kills it you're not fumbling

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.320 
that this kills it you're not fumbling
for<00:04:35.610> anything

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
for anything

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.499 
for anything
so<00:04:36.949> anyway<00:04:37.949> it's<00:04:38.069> a<00:04:38.099> really<00:04:38.280> good<00:04:38.880> upgrade<00:04:39.060> is

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:39.509 
so anyway it's a really good upgrade is

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:41.990 
so anyway it's a really good upgrade is
a<00:04:39.569> little<00:04:39.870> bit<00:04:40.020> expensive<00:04:40.440> I<00:04:40.919> get<00:04:41.610> this<00:04:41.789> for

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
a little bit expensive I get this for

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.540 
a little bit expensive I get this for
like<00:04:42.120> 250<00:04:42.930> bucks<00:04:42.960> used<00:04:43.500> but<00:04:43.830> it's<00:04:44.099> worth<00:04:44.370> every

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
like 250 bucks used but it's worth every

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.719 
like 250 bucks used but it's worth every
penny<00:04:44.789> and<00:04:45.479> once<00:04:46.380> you<00:04:46.530> get<00:04:46.710> used<00:04:47.009> how<00:04:47.190> to<00:04:47.250> set

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
penny and once you get used how to set

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.379 
penny and once you get used how to set
everything<00:04:47.940> on<00:04:48.360> it's<00:04:48.569> also<00:04:48.780> DSM<00:04:49.500> X<00:04:49.770> technology

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
everything on it's also DSM X technology

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:53.390 
everything on it's also DSM X technology
but<00:04:51.389> it's<00:04:51.630> just<00:04:51.930> absolutely<00:04:52.770> bulletproof<00:04:52.949> I

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
but it's just absolutely bulletproof I
