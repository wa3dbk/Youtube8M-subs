00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.200
 the question that probably will not answer me Werder 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:11.339
 love 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:12.599
 Freudenstadt 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:13.939
 in game 

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:15.419
 Jesus 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:18.599
 and kickboxing how does that work? 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:20.119
 ed 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.809
 Kickboxing offers both percent together, Wesener replied 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:31.439
 For many it's not Boxer for many 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.489
 difficult to understand that you really hear 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.080
 The steps came after you hit your nose 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.630
 that's right 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.420
 I give an example percent German 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.600
 is known for being two world champions in between was a politician 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.240
 and there was a fight in the late nineties, George Forms was older 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.270
 located community Holly Field 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.090
 confessing Christian 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.430
 his interview with the linguistically gifted George Forums two days before the fight 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.960
 by the way, having advanced to a second 9 percent age of 45 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.930
 once again became world champion 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.229
 but could withstand a few percent kg with children alone 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.170
 had heard something more 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.500
 But that was on Saturday percent evening on Sunday may stand with us and can 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.060
 cooled ICT program his text from the prophet Isaiah in which it says 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.190
 Gottschalk does not care about the external zoom on the inner 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.720
 so that was something like that and the Hochschild says so in the interview 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.820
 11 8 in the interviewer Iris i can Fly SG the event Holyfield and that's yes 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:37.740
 also Christian 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.860
 see how 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.900
 said Lahm 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.930
 yes but then you could say that they are in heat Christ in Christ 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.200
 said Muller 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.829
 Now they will sleep on the simple way of their brother in Christ 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.440
 the volume of liability that is terribly often not at all 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.430
 thought 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.810
 Barbara Helige Land deal 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.520
 who has boards 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.630
 that is sometimes nice 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.049
 because the Lord has access 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:09.189
 APA 

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:11.299
 to reconcile 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:14.469
 No reconciliation, they make the life of reconciliation clear
