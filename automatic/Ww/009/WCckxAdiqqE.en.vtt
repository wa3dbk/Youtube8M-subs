 small and fast for all people 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.950
 they do not know how to sell items that 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.750
 well, they sell for zero 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.250
 coins in this case I have andres and 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.960
 has this just touched me a little 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.330
 opening that is what we are going to do to 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.800
 can sell it good first of all 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.450
 they should know that they have to have the 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.750
 repeated player to be able to sell it 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.570
 ok though there's a time we know that 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.040
 so we go back to the little arrow 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.810
 here I do not know if you bought new items 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.820
 you want to assign these items now 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.590
 note you can find all the 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.510
 Unassigned articles in articles 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.540
 new in transfer selection 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:39.780
 let's say not 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.350
 and hey, he's going to jump here to the packs 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.350
 obviously 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.450
 we give the little arrow back 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.490
 let's go to our club and we're going to 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.960
 look for the player that we have repeated 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.090
 obviously 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.280
 in my house is andrÃ© iniesta, yes 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.320
 you get some top if you have it 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.740
 repeated it will be easier not for 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.740
 do obviously 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.500
 we go to our club to 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.880
 sell it ok guys too I forget 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.860
 tell them that this is only going to 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.480
 can do once since the next 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.600
 obviously then they will have the 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.600
 player 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.610

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.770
 Well, we are looking for our player 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.370
 it's a very simple step only that I 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.280
 I'm doing a little wave 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.620

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.519
 can be discarded with 712 coins what 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.850
 let's send to the list of 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.670

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.630
 and let's do let's see what load 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.450
 this 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.970
 although we come back and we're going to go to the pile 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.160
 of transfers again 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:57.350
 where we have the articles that 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:01.830
 we had sent from the opening vale of the 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:03.810
 of the pack go the envelope 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.260
 good as you see here we have to iniesta 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.290
 for 0 coins and 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.500
 duplicate duplicate articles sorry 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.840
 let's have here I'm wrong pardon 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.670
 my ignorance new articles we are going to 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.989
 have the articles that are that we 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.750
 won in the envelope can not be 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.489
 sell and in transfers we will have 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.390
 to which we are going to sell that in this case 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.950
 is going to be andrÃ© iniesta ok and as you see 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.130
 Here we can save the article 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.020
 duplicate 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.580

 duplicate item that we can not sell 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.210

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.220

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.710
