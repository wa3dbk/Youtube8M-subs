00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.470
 in my opinion being able to give the opportunity to 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.930
 guys to compete with their own 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.220
 teachers and together to offer gods 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.350
 concerts that really are 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.600
 were the interesting ones that 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.820
 very important for their growth 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.320
 the growth of the conservatory and for 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.440
 the offer we gave to the city of 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.440
 power 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:14.930
 in addition to a dense program with music 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.240
 of faul and mascagni and so much space 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.710
 has been given to young talents is 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.410
 definitely an opportunity for us 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.150
 very important students a field of 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.620
 try and for those that are ours 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.010
 emotions but also for what the is 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.440
 our work is a first experience that 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.630
 we do like as orchestra and 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.940
 hopefully it can also be a good one 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.740
 launch pad for the preserved 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.170
 the same in such a way that the activity 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.670
 can convey what passion 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.590
 that we students have for music and 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.280
 so was the satisfaction of the 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.280
