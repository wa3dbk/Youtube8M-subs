00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:03.969
 here the potential patients of body remodeling treatments 

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:08.069
 they are often frustrated by ugly fat deposits to be seen that do not 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.259
 they go despite long diets and exercises 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:15.860
 often disappointed by the efforts to perfect the image of one's body 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:18.630
 driven to look for a medical solution 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.810
 contour guanda provides the doctor with an excellent tool to help them 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:23.810
 patients 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.450
 for the first time, doctors have a treatment in their arsenal 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.780
 measurable results together with the safety of the non-invasiveness of the 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.730
 ultrasonic treatment 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.190
 there is no need for anesthesia with the risks that it involves no risk 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.660
 of pulmonary embolism no hematoma formation after treatment e 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.560
 needs hospitalization 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.410
 the patient can make the treatment return to his normal life the 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.550
 same day 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.620
 the ultra shape treatment destroys fat cells offers you an average of 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.720
 2 centimeters of reduction in the circumference of the treated area 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.780
 thanks to a precise mapping that records and synchronizes the position of the 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.730
 body in real time freedom of movement is allowed to the patient 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.220
 the treatment is limited to the selected air and ensures a homogeneous coverage 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.020
 of the entire affected area as well as ensuring that no points are excluded or 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.420
 treated twice 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.860
 the wham contour detection system was designed to ensure 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.730
 optimal results in terms of treatment 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.280
 shortens the learning curve that reduces the dependency of the result 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.400
 operator 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.560
 no maintenance sessions are required but patients can 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.530
 choose to do more than one treatment 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.979
 the transducer emits an ultrasound beam and provides in real time 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.880
 acoustic and optical feedback on the treatment 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.560
 uses multidirectional acoustic waves to ensure that the energy with rod 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.000
 only on the selected area 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.350
 specific ultrasound parameters related to the pulse length via 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.700
 energy level 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.950
 all the fat cells ensure selective damage 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.740
 non-fatty overlying tissues are not damaged as they are not subject 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.720
 to these parameters the ultrasonic wave causes the mechanical crushing of the 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.719
 fat cell membranes, adipocytes 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:21.249
 the content consisting essentially of triglycerides 

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:25.479
 it is released into the interstitial fluid where it is subjected to 

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:28.299
 further physiological metabolic processes 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:32.749
 while the cell membranes are broken down and the triglycerides released 

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:35.799
 the body begins a gradual transformation process 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:39.109
 robot index and free fatty acids 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:42.680
 free fatty acids bind to albumin and come slowly 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.709
 transported to the liver hey used as nucleic acid ooh units 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:48.979
 power 

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:53.689
 It has been clinically proven that the body's ability to dispose of molecules 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:58.529
 of triglycerides is much greater than the amount of triglycerides released 

00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:00.209
 during treatment 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.179
 patients in systematically confirm the ease i 

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:07.739
 convenience of ultra shade treatments and do not report side effects e 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.419
 treatment inconveniences 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:15.729
 ultra shape the first effective and non-invasive solution for the remodeling of the 

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:16.279
 body 

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:20.559
 patients can choose the different areas to be treated ultra choice
