00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
we're going to keep our defense on the

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.109 
we're going to keep our defense on the
bench<00:01:16.770> sometimes<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.490> there<00:01:17.610> won't<00:01:17.700> be<00:01:17.820> gas

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
bench sometimes so there won't be gas

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.300

to<00:01:20.369> run<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:21.390> ball<00:01:21.630> there's<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.439> many<00:01:22.590> reasons

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
to run the ball there's so many reasons

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.210 
to run the ball there's so many reasons
other<00:01:23.189> than<00:01:23.369> just<00:01:23.729> scoring<00:01:24.890> for<00:01:25.890> running<00:01:26.189> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
other than just scoring for running the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.980 
other than just scoring for running the
ball<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.790> that's<00:01:26.939> what<00:01:27.180> we<00:01:27.270> need<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.509> do<00:01:27.659> and

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
ball and that's what we need to do and

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.020 
ball and that's what we need to do and
the<00:01:28.530> thing<00:01:28.680> about<00:01:28.740> these<00:01:29.100> next<00:01:29.520> two<00:01:29.700> games

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
the thing about these next two games

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.870 
the thing about these next two games
with<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.720> raiders<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.860> redskins<00:01:32.579> coming

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
with the raiders and the redskins coming

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.350 
with the raiders and the redskins coming
up<00:01:32.970> next<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:34.259> both<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.560> those<00:01:34.829> teams<00:01:35.360> it's

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
up next is that both of those teams it's

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.230 
up next is that both of those teams it's
not<00:01:36.570> easy<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:37.079> pass<00:01:37.290> on<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:38.460> redskins<00:01:38.939> i<00:01:39.030> think

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
not easy to pass on the redskins i think

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.910 
not easy to pass on the redskins i think
our<00:01:39.329> number<00:01:39.540> one<00:01:39.780> in<00:01:40.020> pass<00:01:40.229> defense<00:01:40.259> i<00:01:40.740> think

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
our number one in pass defense i think

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.410 
our number one in pass defense i think
they're<00:01:41.009> not<00:01:41.159> might<00:01:41.280> be<00:01:41.400> number<00:01:41.579> one<00:01:41.729> in<00:01:41.759> total

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
they're not might be number one in total

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.710 
they're not might be number one in total
defense<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:43.350> um<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.909> raiders<00:01:45.240> still<00:01:45.509> have

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
defense so um and the raiders still have

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.560 
defense so um and the raiders still have

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
days and and sit at what eight and three

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.610 
days and and sit at what eight and three
and<00:02:12.120> let<00:02:12.239> everybody<00:02:12.450> catch<00:02:12.810> up<00:02:12.989> with<00:02:13.170> us

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
and let everybody catch up with us

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.979 
and let everybody catch up with us
I<00:02:13.650> mean<00:02:13.920> that's<00:02:14.489> that's<00:02:14.849> a<00:02:15.030> bit<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.330> if<00:02:15.750> we're

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
I mean that's that's a bit and if we're

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.589 
I mean that's that's a bit and if we're
at<00:02:16.170> eight<00:02:16.409> and<00:02:16.560> three<00:02:17.330> with<00:02:18.330> that<00:02:18.540> backs<00:02:18.870> a

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
at eight and three with that backs a

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.509 
at eight and three with that backs a
five-game<00:02:21.599> stretch<00:02:21.900> that<00:02:22.620> tough<00:02:22.920> backside

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
five-game stretch that tough backside

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.500 
five-game stretch that tough backside
stress<00:02:24.030> stress<00:02:24.420> I<00:02:24.659> think<00:02:25.530> if<00:02:25.860> we<00:02:26.760> go<00:02:27.150> three<00:02:27.480> and

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
stress stress I think if we go three and

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.050 
stress stress I think if we go three and
two<00:02:27.659> on<00:02:27.750> that<00:02:28.019> stretch<00:02:28.379> we're<00:02:28.830> what<00:02:29.280> 11<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:29.879> 5

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
two on that stretch we're what 11 and 5

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.140 
two on that stretch we're what 11 and 5
which<00:02:30.989> is<00:02:31.019> great<00:02:31.440> if<00:02:31.650> we<00:02:32.069> go<00:02:32.250> two<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:32.730> three<00:02:33.120> in

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
which is great if we go two and three in

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.600 
which is great if we go two and three in
that<00:02:33.360> stretch<00:02:33.540> which<00:02:33.750> is<00:02:33.900> possible<00:02:34.440> we'll<00:02:35.370> go

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
that stretch which is possible we'll go

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.289 
that stretch which is possible we'll go
on<00:02:36.200> 10<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.230> six<00:02:37.650> now<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.489> problem<00:02:38.819> with<00:02:39.030> 10

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
on 10 and six now the problem with 10

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.690 
on 10 and six now the problem with 10
and<00:02:39.480> 6<00:02:39.750> is<00:02:39.989> though<00:02:40.650> that<00:02:40.680> team<00:02:41.129> that<00:02:41.159> just<00:02:41.430> beat

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
and 6 is though that team that just beat

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.580 
and 6 is though that team that just beat
is<00:02:41.819> because<00:02:42.000> Green<00:02:42.269> Bay<00:02:42.480> has<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.989> cupcake

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
is because Green Bay has a cupcake

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.440 
is because Green Bay has a cupcake
schedule<00:02:43.860> and<00:02:44.280> too<00:02:44.459> hard<00:02:44.700> teams<00:02:44.970> I<00:02:45.120> think<00:02:45.150> they

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
schedule and too hard teams I think they

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:52.449 
schedule and too hard teams I think they
have<00:02:45.629> is<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:48.709> Ravens<00:02:49.709> and<00:02:50.690> someone<00:02:51.690> else<00:02:51.900> I

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
have is the Ravens and someone else I

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.369 
have is the Ravens and someone else I
can't<00:02:53.459> think<00:02:53.549> I'm<00:02:53.819> right<00:02:54.060> now<00:02:54.239> but<00:02:55.109> they<00:02:55.230> have

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
can't think I'm right now but they have

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.759 
can't think I'm right now but they have
two<00:02:55.700> fairly<00:02:56.700> difficult<00:02:56.849> games<00:02:57.569> and<00:02:57.989> a<00:02:58.530> lot<00:02:58.739> of

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
two fairly difficult games and a lot of

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.490 
two fairly difficult games and a lot of
lot<00:02:59.579> of<00:02:59.700> easy<00:02:59.879> games<00:03:00.239> I<00:03:00.510> think<00:03:00.720> they<00:03:00.870> get<00:03:00.989> Tampa

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
lot of easy games I think they get Tampa

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.660 
lot of easy games I think they get Tampa
twice<00:03:01.650> or<00:03:01.980> something<00:03:02.010> like<00:03:02.340> that<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:02.549> don't
