00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:07.049
 hello friends how are all the diet 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.090
 landscape engineer and I want to 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.460
 give them some tips on how to put together a 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.960
 garden in a small space in general 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.759
 we all have the idea of what to do 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.740
 landscaping means a big piece of 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.810
 ground but the real thing is that the life of 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.609
 city allows us to have only a small 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.619
 space and we want you to transform it 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.910
 in a nice place where you can spend 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.789
 a rich afternoon when you return from 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.500
 work and we want you to know that a 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.949
 small space can also be a very 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.949
 nice garden 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.630
 we are here watching a garden wants 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.850
 have around 4 x 4 4 x 5 a 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.950
 pretty small space in a house the 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.690
 back of a garden and the 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.100
 advice that I would give them is that when 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.040
 choose the plants be especially 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.650
 careful when they have little space 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.970
 try to choose plants as much as possible 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.470
 that during some times of the year 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.030
 have some attractiveness that is 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.190
 interesting but at the same time 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.619
 retains in an orderly aspect to what 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.119
 throughout the entire year in the case what 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.979
 you see here a copy of the 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.869
 These per moon is a plant of origin 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.759
 Australian that has the peculiarity 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:17.080
 to bloom practically all the 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.080
 winter and all the spring 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.630
 in the case they still carry out a 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.000
 fairly new copy however it's going to 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.190
 take a very interesting body in some 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.020
 couple of years we need to do 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.120
 some training pruning normally 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.460
 of blunting but from the months of 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.260
 July until the months of October to 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.300
 early November to have a 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.600
 copy that will accompany us with this 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.110
 flowering during all the months that 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.110
 the mentions 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.420
 now coming back on the subject of 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.210
 order we have a copy of dogs by 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.950
 an ankle in this case dwarf as is 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.410
 can see in a plant in general that 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.080
 it has a pretty armed structure and 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.280
 I advise you to occupy this type of 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.340
 plants when they have a garden 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.900
 small do not forget to choose plants 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.820
 that have interesting dynamics 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.010
 during the remainder of the year 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.470
 that means they have either jewelry or flower 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.110
 or fruits for at least 12 weeks 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.720
 or at least for eight in such a way 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.580
 that what is green and static is 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.640
 accompany with things like the other super 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.410
 mont which is the pink one at this time or 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.690
 like this curious what you see more 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.850
 down that is called brunella vulgar and is 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.390
 that despite this recently emerging from 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.250
 your winter break is going to fill up 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.260
 flowers during the months of December 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.510
 January and probably a second 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.130
 important flowering when it starts 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.130
 the autumn towards the end of March 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.319
 so friends do not forget that a 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.209
 small garden can be a great place 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.980
 of rest a great place of enjoyment 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.780
 remember to combine the plants well 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.849
 do not forget that the color plays a 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.170
 very important paper take advantage of 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.640
 include fruits and for those lovers 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.099
 of the animals I tell you that there 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.230
 many plants that bring rich flowers and 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:14.540
 birds so just as I told them a 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:18.040
 Small place can really be a 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.040
 great little enjoyment 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.570
 I want us to talk about vines 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.490
 because the vines because 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.230
 probably each one of us or 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.090
 many of us have some has 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.610
 some wall that we definitely want 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.470
 cover an annoying wall the wall that makes 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.970
 neighbor's house that wall that was 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.709
 in front of our living room and I want 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.240
 tell them that there is a good amount of 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.580
 plants that have the characteristic of 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.220
 grow totally alone from the point of 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.020
 view of asserting themselves and thus allow 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.420
 that instead of having segments the view 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.010
 let's have this as is the case what 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:57.260
 is producing in this place a 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.260
 vine that is called ficus repens 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.500
 do not 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.200
 the ficus repens that do not remain here is a 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:16.000
 rather rustic creeper, not fast 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.130
 growth but that has an advantage 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.900
 since as you can see it has a 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.000
 quite limited growth and that in 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.770
 general follows the shape of the wall what 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.810
 for all those who want things 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.550
 of the garden with little work is something that 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.550
 I really suggest you use 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.940
 the vines are a great world where 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.680
 there are many different species already 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.870
 I showed the ficus repens that is which 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.000
 I told them it grew very close the wall is a 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.710
 pretty neat and fast growth 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.140
 but there are vines that also 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:56.170
 they deliver interesting things like this 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.580
 jasmine polian is that it is a plant that 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.350
 produces a flower during the spring 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.240
 early spring this is around 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:05.010
 September to the first days of 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.010
 November pretty fragrant 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.499
 do not 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:16.199
 if you wanted to cover 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.520
 a wall a pergola or simply cover 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:19.229
 some view that you are not interested in seeing 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.970
 as the case of this wall that makes a 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:22.590
 bathroom I recommend you occupy this 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.780
 plant that as I told you is called 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.360
 also polenta since it produces a smell 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.990
 which is really a delight during 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.990
 all spring 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:39.069
 vines not only to cover walls 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:40.629
 but also to produce corners of 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:42.399
 enjoy in this case a pergola 

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:44.409
 covered by a jasmine that has a pair 

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:46.689
 of years in the spring with all its 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:48.309
 Friends flowers let us keep enjoying 

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:50.789
 its gardens and we'll see you until a 

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:50.789
 Next time 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.710
 Y
