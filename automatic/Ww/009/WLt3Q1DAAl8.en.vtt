00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
bike the friction caused on this wheel

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.719 
bike the friction caused on this wheel
right<00:01:51.270> here<00:01:51.590> turns<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.829> on<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.280> will

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
right here turns that on and will

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.270 
right here turns that on and will
illuminate<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.240> bike<00:01:54.649> now<00:01:55.649> obviously<00:01:56.100> right

bike I can't gain enough momentum to
actually<00:01:59.640> show<00:01:59.820> you<00:01:59.880> this<00:02:00.090> but<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:01.229> thought

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
actually show you this but I thought

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.200 
actually show you this but I thought
that<00:02:01.770> was<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.890> really<00:02:02.040> interesting<00:02:02.340> feature<00:02:02.759> I

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
that was a really interesting feature I

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.219 
that was a really interesting feature I
just<00:02:03.479> don't<00:02:03.630> see<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:03.869> kind<00:02:04.049> of<00:02:04.140> stuff

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
just don't see that kind of stuff

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.569 
just don't see that kind of stuff
anymore<00:02:04.590> obviously<00:02:04.920> with<00:02:05.340> all<00:02:05.460> these

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
anymore obviously with all these

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.440 
anymore obviously with all these
advanced<00:02:06.329> batteries<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.649> LED<00:02:08.129> lights<00:02:08.450> it's

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
advanced batteries and LED lights it's

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.570 
advanced batteries and LED lights it's
really<00:02:09.840> uh<00:02:10.190> not<00:02:11.190> that<00:02:11.370> practical<00:02:11.550> anymore

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
really uh not that practical anymore

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.420 
really uh not that practical anymore
but<00:02:13.240> still<00:02:13.450> I<00:02:13.480> thought<00:02:13.660> is<00:02:13.780> pretty<00:02:13.990> cool<00:02:14.430> and

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
but still I thought is pretty cool and

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.630 
but still I thought is pretty cool and
it's<00:02:16.360> a<00:02:16.450> 3-speed<00:02:16.990> to<00:02:17.620> nowadays<00:02:18.010> we<00:02:18.430> have<00:02:18.460> like

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
it's a 3-speed to nowadays we have like

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.360 
it's a 3-speed to nowadays we have like
seven<00:02:19.060> speeds<00:02:19.360> but<00:02:20.050> uh<00:02:20.110> you<00:02:20.710> can<00:02:20.770> shift<00:02:21.010> to

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
seven speeds but uh you can shift to

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.340 
seven speeds but uh you can shift to
different<00:02:22.210> gears<00:02:22.510> and<00:02:23.470> uh<00:02:24.540> there's<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.600> brakes

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
different gears and uh there's a brakes

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.580 
different gears and uh there's a brakes
front<00:02:27.190> back<00:02:27.400> I'll<00:02:28.180> give<00:02:28.360> you<00:02:28.480> a<00:02:28.540> look<00:02:29.230> at<00:02:29.380> that

think<00:02:52.540> about<00:02:52.690> this<00:02:52.840> bike<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.709> tires<00:02:53.950> actually

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
think about this bike the tires actually

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.230 
think about this bike the tires actually
surprisingly<00:02:54.910> in<00:02:55.090> pretty<00:02:55.690> decent<00:02:55.840> shape<00:02:56.110> I

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
surprisingly in pretty decent shape I

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.640 
surprisingly in pretty decent shape I
did<00:02:58.240> some<00:02:58.390> research<00:02:58.570> on<00:02:58.870> this<00:02:59.050> bike<00:02:59.260> just<00:02:59.560> to

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
did some research on this bike just to

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.380 
did some research on this bike just to
see<00:02:59.830> if<00:02:59.950> maybe<00:03:00.520> I<00:03:00.610> have<00:03:00.700> a<00:03:00.760> gold<00:03:00.970> mine<00:03:01.120> on<00:03:01.150> my

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
see if maybe I have a gold mine on my

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.250 
see if maybe I have a gold mine on my
hands<00:03:01.750> but<00:03:02.410> actually<00:03:02.860> I<00:03:02.890> do<00:03:03.010> not<00:03:04.170> you<00:03:05.170> like

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
hands but actually I do not you like

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.920 
hands but actually I do not you like
Google<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.709> bike<00:03:05.890> name<00:03:06.190> and<00:03:06.780> there<00:03:07.780> really

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
Google the bike name and there really

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.500 
Google the bike name and there really
wasn't<00:03:08.140> anything<00:03:08.500> much<00:03:08.770> about<00:03:09.010> it<00:03:09.340> so<00:03:10.300> I'm

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
wasn't anything much about it so I'm

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.880 
wasn't anything much about it so I'm
assuming<00:03:10.840> just<00:03:11.230> because<00:03:11.440> it's<00:03:11.590> in<00:03:11.709> good<00:03:11.830> shape

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
assuming just because it's in good shape

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.650 
assuming just because it's in good shape
it's<00:03:12.340> probably<00:03:12.640> you<00:03:12.760> know<00:03:12.850> worth<00:03:13.030> about<00:03:13.270> 20

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
it's probably you know worth about 20

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.320 
it's probably you know worth about 20
bucks<00:03:14.100> so<00:03:15.100> off<00:03:15.190> to<00:03:15.340> see<00:03:15.459> what<00:03:15.580> I<00:03:15.610> can<00:03:15.820> do<00:03:16.000> and
