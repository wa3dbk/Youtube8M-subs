 And now, first of all, imagine that they are at home right now 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.060
 made comfortable look forward to a nice evening and think of anything bad 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.330
 literally a huge tree falls out of the blue on her house 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.730
 This and welcome surprise was experienced yesterday zoo Dietz man 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.020
 Rellingen StÃ¤ger Dietzmann only barely die from death as it happened 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.020
 he was able to show Hannemann and Nils started 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:33.040
 This electronic waste is all that is left of the laundry room of the lunchtime today 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:34.770
 GIZ Mainz is still left 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.710
 the tree from the neighboring garden had fallen right on top of the dryer, but that 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.780
 Married couple was lucky in bad luck because of a cigarette break had Helga Dietz 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.900
 you have not started washing 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.730
 if it is now 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.230
 Peter would have gone early in the race would have thought what she wants 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.109
 led then we would probably get the choice on the head 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:56.270
 It was expected 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.060
 all three parties in the room 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.210
 all were when crowded routes 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.950
 was so speechless under goose bumps and very weak knees 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.590
 It is quarter past nine yesterday evening when the 30 meter gate beech suddenly in 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.020
 two parts broken 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.509
 For 120 years she was healthy and strong on the neighboring property 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.570
 been 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.750
 that is why the tree breaking apart comes for the whole neighborhood 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.630
 completely surprising my husband was under the tariff no handle 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.549
 Nicholas, because he did not know that, but that 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.940
 falls and how far that fits he is on 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.940
 her own house is spared 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.280
 but in the roof of the neighboring house has a branch of a weight of 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.500
 more than ten small cars drilled 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.289
 the house itself is hardly recognizable under the 15-meter-wide treetop 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.930
 For the Berlin fire department begins a complex large-scale operation 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.240
 MÃ¼nster even an hour 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.940
 you find a full closure instead of we still one

 Two Latton drivers have requested to drive 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.570
 that helps us 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.290
 to secure the trunk 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.299
 42 firefighters are in laborious work at first 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:04.590
 all smaller ones may have multiple chains becoming dull 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.259
 then the 200 ton crane can lay the main cast on the roof 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.250
 At noon the 20 will finally come an explanation for the tree 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:20.230
 Part of the break of the pear tree is at a certain height of this TiSUN 4 5 meters 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.870
 Height divided lower the weight of the tree that is then at some point 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.570
 hard that he just tired but tired breaks 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.560

 Stream without a band Unholy 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:34.590
 that such a case is extremely rare 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.290
 couple Kietzmann hardly consoles mainly because the two maybe on the 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.110
 Expenses remain amazement expert from the insurance 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.820
 and the

 to be approved what to hibernate may not pay us if ever that 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.019
 becomes 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.819
 the big question for safety reasons was the bad luck tree by now 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.579
