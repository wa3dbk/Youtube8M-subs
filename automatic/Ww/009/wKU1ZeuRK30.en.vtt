00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.259
 welcome to the vegetation 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.849
 report this week the picture behind 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.360
 I am destined for many of them 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.970
 known 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.670
 because stock occurred frequently this year 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.090
 not only in winter barley but 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.830
 also in wheat and winter rape currently 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.109
 the harvest and many harvests 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.390
 torment themselves through such stocks 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.540
 stock does not just mean that the 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.899
 low power is lowered but 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.040
 that also quality losses and 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.980
 but earnings also decrease 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.760
 that outgrowth risk increases the first 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.090
 Income in the stocks was relatively good 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.190
 above average 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.899
 nevertheless one sees this in many regions 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.510
 especially in southern and western Germany 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.250
 where a lot of precipitation now 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.370
 Recently the numbers have dropped 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.539
 not the right way to grow 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.039
 Rising risk and thus the problem that 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.890
 after all to store 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.350
 So if you have wheat varieties 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.360
 not the case is stable try 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.460
 to reap them as quickly as possible 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.750
 The rape harvest is in many places 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.909
 completed and the income 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.720
 exceed outstanding from the 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.180
 last year 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.780
 It even went from five to six tons 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.180
 spoken in some regions 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.860
 At present , the outgrowth is kept in rapeseed 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.869
 The landlords are on their feet 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.320
 trab express means that the 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.119
 storability is limited 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.670
 if the rape is threshed it is 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.890
 important the seeds fell on the ground 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.259
 are partly to encourage that not 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.420
 do not rest and then go through 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.930
 a deep tillage in the ground 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.009
 lie 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.259
 So what should you do now? 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.479
 Tillage should be done flat 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.119
 with whatever device you have 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.439
 For example, wheat is available 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.899
 pound slices or a flat 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.810
 Gruber so that the seeds are possible too 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.930
 to germinate 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.119
 being stimulated is important too 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.810
 to provide ground closure so one 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.640
 roller to run in retrospect 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.800
 to allow water connection 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.959
 if you have a big current math 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.030
 or as here such power straw pile 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.220
 have where then many more seeds 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.010
 in that it is important that 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.780
 that will be torn apart then 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.459
 They also looked really bottomless 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.930
 to have 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.459
 this year, it's striking that she 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:35.709
 stems are not as green as in 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:38.709
 last year here on this beat 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.930
 was probably a half dwarf variety 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.670
 on other punches with normal 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.840
 hybrid or lineage varieties are the 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.019
 stems often higher 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.150
 and if they are relatively green 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.760
 the possibility that you leave the munich 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.200
 then the further processing steps 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.330
 to optimize 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.580
 I wish you a successful one 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:01.019
 reap and hope that we will meet next 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.019
 wednesday see again until then bye
