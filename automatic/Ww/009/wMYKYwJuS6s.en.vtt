00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
Cappadocia okay so I'll just change the

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.080 
Cappadocia okay so I'll just change the
composition<00:00:52.500> quickly<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.550> none<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.789> that

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
composition quickly so that none of that

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.729

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
sky at the top right is in and that is

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.830 
sky at the top right is in and that is
pretty<00:00:59.489> much<00:00:59.699> perfect<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.269> think<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:00.660> I'm<00:01:00.719> going

pretty much perfect I think so I'm going

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.410 
pretty much perfect I think so I'm going
to<00:01:00.870> tap<00:01:01.079> on<00:01:01.260> crop<00:01:04.250> and<00:01:05.250> I'll<00:01:05.460> start<00:01:05.760> editing

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
to tap on crop and I'll start editing

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.630 
to tap on crop and I'll start editing

blending modes until I find something
that<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.380> like<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:41.310> see<00:01:41.549> some<00:01:41.759> blending<00:01:42.060> modes

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
that I like you see some blending modes

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.300 
that I like you see some blending modes
make<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.689> image<00:01:42.840> much<00:01:43.049> darker<00:01:43.619> I'll<00:01:44.159> just

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
make the image much darker I'll just

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.880 
make the image much darker I'll just
make<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.700> much<00:01:44.880> lighter<00:01:45.149> but<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.960> few<00:01:46.500> actually

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
make it much lighter but a few actually

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.440 
make it much lighter but a few actually
look<00:01:47.070> nice<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:47.640> think<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:48.030> like<00:01:48.180> soft

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
look nice and I think that I like soft

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.630 
look nice and I think that I like soft
light<00:01:48.719> for<00:01:49.020> this<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:49.799> I'm<00:01:49.860> gonna<00:01:49.979> select<00:01:50.250> soft

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
light for this so I'm gonna select soft

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.719 
light for this so I'm gonna select soft
light<00:01:50.880> tap<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.509> okay<00:01:51.810> checkmark<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.040> then<00:01:53.700> I

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
light tap the okay checkmark and then I

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.090 
light tap the okay checkmark and then I
also<00:01:53.909> look<00:01:54.210> at<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.689> opacity<00:01:55.259> values<00:01:55.890> using

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
also look at the opacity values using

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.179 
also look at the opacity values using
the<00:01:56.340> opacity<00:01:56.579> slider<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.590> I<00:01:58.590> think<00:01:58.860> something

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
the opacity slider and I think something

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.270 
the opacity slider and I think something
like<00:01:59.340> 60<00:02:00.119> will<00:02:00.360> look<00:02:00.570> good<00:02:00.780> here<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:02.009> I'll<00:02:02.100> just

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
like 60 will look good here so I'll just

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.190 
like 60 will look good here so I'll just
have<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.610> screen<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.060> hide<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.390> controls<00:02:03.810> and

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
have the screen to hide the controls and

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.690 
have the screen to hide the controls and

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
with this and now I'm going to add

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.780 
with this and now I'm going to add
another<00:02:10.770> layer<00:02:11.220> using<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.850> plus<00:02:12.060> icon<00:02:13.790> now

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
another layer using the plus icon now

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.100 
another layer using the plus icon now
let's<00:02:14.940> select<00:02:15.210> a<00:02:15.420> new<00:02:15.660> pack

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.320 

and<00:02:18.200> for<00:02:18.680> this<00:02:18.860> I<00:02:19.130> want<00:02:19.280> to<00:02:19.370> go<00:02:19.520> to<00:02:19.580> light<00:02:19.970> leaks

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
and for this I want to go to light leaks

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.330 
and for this I want to go to light leaks
and<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.260> reason<00:02:21.500> why<00:02:21.590> I<00:02:21.650> want<00:02:21.830> to<00:02:21.920> do<00:02:22.100> light

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
and the reason why I want to do light

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.730 
and the reason why I want to do light
leaks<00:02:22.610> for<00:02:22.820> this<00:02:22.940> image<00:02:23.240> is<00:02:23.450> that<00:02:23.480> this<00:02:24.440> image

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
leaks for this image is that this image

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.180 
leaks for this image is that this image
already<00:02:25.000> has<00:02:26.000> some<00:02:26.420> sun<00:02:27.140> shining<00:02:27.590> inside<00:02:28.070> of

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
already has some sun shining inside of

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.980 
already has some sun shining inside of
frame<00:02:28.460> now<00:02:29.030> you<00:02:29.090> can<00:02:29.240> see<00:02:29.390> that<00:02:29.570> health<00:02:29.780> of<00:02:29.900> the

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
frame now you can see that health of the

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.770 
frame now you can see that health of the
girl<00:02:30.140> is<00:02:30.290> actually<00:02:30.650> in<00:02:31.100> the<00:02:31.310> Sun<00:02:31.580> and<00:02:31.880> there's

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
girl is actually in the Sun and there's

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.960 
girl is actually in the Sun and there's
some<00:02:33.020> Sun<00:02:33.230> in<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:33.470> rocks<00:02:33.710> and<00:02:34.130> by<00:02:34.580> adding<00:02:34.820> some

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
some Sun in the rocks and by adding some

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.050 
some Sun in the rocks and by adding some
light<00:02:35.150> leaks<00:02:35.390> I<00:02:35.570> can<00:02:35.750> further<00:02:36.050> emphasize<00:02:36.590> this

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
light leaks I can further emphasize this

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.060 
light leaks I can further emphasize this
influence<00:02:38.060> of<00:02:38.360> warm<00:02:39.140> light<00:02:39.260> into<00:02:39.740> the<00:02:39.860> scene

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
influence of warm light into the scene

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.770 
influence of warm light into the scene
so<00:02:40.610> let<00:02:40.730> me<00:02:40.820> just<00:02:41.000> find<00:02:41.150> something<00:02:41.450> that<00:02:41.600> works

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
so let me just find something that works

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:48.760 
so let me just find something that works
good<00:02:42.110> for<00:02:42.320> this<00:02:42.410> image<00:02:46.900> okay<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.260> I<00:02:48.470> think

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
good for this image okay and I think

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.860 
good for this image okay and I think
that<00:02:48.860> sunflower<00:02:49.520> could<00:02:49.820> be<00:02:49.940> really<00:02:50.209> nice<00:02:50.420> here

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
that sunflower could be really nice here

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.070 
that sunflower could be really nice here
but<00:02:51.650> I<00:02:52.070> don't<00:02:52.160> really<00:02:52.430> like<00:02:52.610> how<00:02:53.120> it's<00:02:53.390> blended

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
but I don't really like how it's blended

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.720 
but I don't really like how it's blended
into<00:02:54.260> it<00:02:54.560> was<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:54.770> rest<00:02:54.950> of<00:02:55.070> the<00:02:55.190> image<00:02:55.400> so<00:02:55.610> let

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
into it was the rest of the image so let

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:03.370 
into it was the rest of the image so let
me<00:02:55.880> look<00:02:56.000> at<00:02:56.150> blending<00:02:56.390> modes<00:02:59.290> and<00:03:02.230> from<00:03:03.230> these

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
me look at blending modes and from these

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.229 
me look at blending modes and from these
I<00:03:03.410> think<00:03:03.739> overlay<00:03:04.130> is<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.489> best<00:03:04.700> because<00:03:05.030> it

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
I think overlay is the best because it

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.090 
I think overlay is the best because it
makes<00:03:05.420> the<00:03:05.570> image<00:03:05.720> much<00:03:05.959> warmer<00:03:06.470> which<00:03:06.950> is

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
makes the image much warmer which is

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.560 
makes the image much warmer which is
exactly<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:07.850> kind<00:03:08.030> of<00:03:08.090> look<00:03:08.270> that<00:03:08.390> I'm<00:03:08.540> going

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
exactly the kind of look that I'm going

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.090 
exactly the kind of look that I'm going
for<00:03:08.930> so<00:03:09.920> I'm<00:03:09.980> gonna<00:03:10.130> tap<00:03:10.430> okay<00:03:11.380> and<00:03:12.380> I'm<00:03:12.920> gonna

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
for so I'm gonna tap okay and I'm gonna

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.490 
for so I'm gonna tap okay and I'm gonna
leave<00:03:13.310> the<00:03:13.610> opacity<00:03:14.030> at<00:03:14.420> 50<00:03:14.900> because<00:03:15.170> this<00:03:15.350> to

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
leave the opacity at 50 because this to

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.100 
leave the opacity at 50 because this to
me<00:03:15.530> is<00:03:15.650> pretty<00:03:16.040> much<00:03:16.160> perfect<00:03:16.370> already<00:03:17.110> and

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
me is pretty much perfect already and

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.540 
me is pretty much perfect already and
now<00:03:18.350> that<00:03:18.560> I'm<00:03:18.620> happy<00:03:18.739> was<00:03:19.070> the<00:03:19.220> second

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
now that I'm happy was the second

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.729 
now that I'm happy was the second
adjustment<00:03:19.670> layer<00:03:20.270> I'm<00:03:20.870> going<00:03:21.170> to<00:03:21.350> add<00:03:21.440> one

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
adjustment layer I'm going to add one

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.560 
adjustment layer I'm going to add one
more<00:03:22.010> adjustment<00:03:22.130> layer<00:03:22.820> by<00:03:23.120> tapping<00:03:23.330> the

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
more adjustment layer by tapping the

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.930 
more adjustment layer by tapping the
plus<00:03:23.780> icon<00:03:24.940> select<00:03:25.940> new<00:03:26.180> pack<00:03:26.480> and<00:03:27.760> here<00:03:28.760> I'm

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
plus icon select new pack and here I'm

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.880 
plus icon select new pack and here I'm
going<00:03:29.180> for<00:03:29.660> landscape<00:03:30.320> enhanced<00:03:30.860> adjustments

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
going for landscape enhanced adjustments

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.960 
going for landscape enhanced adjustments
okay<00:03:33.890> so<00:03:33.950> there<00:03:34.250> are<00:03:34.280> a<00:03:34.370> lot<00:03:34.489> of<00:03:34.519> things<00:03:34.820> I

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
okay so there are a lot of things I

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.960 
okay so there are a lot of things I
could<00:03:35.180> do<00:03:35.360> here<00:03:35.810> but<00:03:36.799> I<00:03:36.830> have<00:03:37.040> one<00:03:37.370> thing<00:03:37.640> in

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
could do here but I have one thing in

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.180 
could do here but I have one thing in
particular<00:03:38.269> that<00:03:39.019> I<00:03:39.230> think<00:03:39.290> would<00:03:40.160> work

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
particular that I think would work

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.220 
particular that I think would work
really<00:03:40.549> well<00:03:40.700> with<00:03:41.150> this<00:03:41.420> photo<00:03:41.720> and<00:03:41.959> that<00:03:42.110> is

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
really well with this photo and that is

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.620 
really well with this photo and that is
the<00:03:42.760> forestry<00:03:43.760> adjustment<00:03:46.239> okay<00:03:47.239> so<00:03:47.299> what

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
the forestry adjustment okay so what

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.770 
the forestry adjustment okay so what
this<00:03:47.690> adjustment<00:03:48.260> does<00:03:48.410> is<00:03:48.830> it<00:03:49.430> kind<00:03:50.390> of<00:03:50.450> makes

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
this adjustment does is it kind of makes

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.590 
this adjustment does is it kind of makes
part<00:03:51.320> of<00:03:51.410> the<00:03:51.500> image<00:03:51.769> a<00:03:51.890> bit<00:03:52.040> cooler<00:03:52.370> and<00:03:52.790> so<00:03:53.450> we

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
part of the image a bit cooler and so we

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.740 
part of the image a bit cooler and so we
have<00:03:53.810> at<00:03:54.410> the<00:03:54.530> top<00:03:55.010> left<00:03:55.340> we<00:03:55.880> have<00:03:55.910> really<00:03:56.480> warm

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
have at the top left we have really warm

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.780 
have at the top left we have really warm
colors<00:03:57.140> coming<00:03:57.500> directly<00:03:57.860> from<00:03:57.950> the<00:03:58.130> Sun<00:03:58.489> and

at the bottom right now thanks to this

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.680 
at the bottom right now thanks to this
adjustment<00:04:01.430> the<00:04:01.850> course<00:04:02.090> are<00:04:02.330> a<00:04:02.360> little<00:04:02.480> bit

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
adjustment the course are a little bit

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.570 
adjustment the course are a little bit
cooler<00:04:02.989> but<00:04:03.230> let<00:04:03.769> me<00:04:03.890> see<00:04:04.040> what<00:04:04.190> we<00:04:04.220> can<00:04:04.430> do

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
cooler but let me see what we can do

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:10.000 
cooler but let me see what we can do
with<00:04:04.810> blending<00:04:05.810> modes<00:04:06.019> here<00:04:07.030> and<00:04:08.769> maybe<00:04:09.769> some

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
with blending modes here and maybe some

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.170 
with blending modes here and maybe some
of<00:04:10.130> the<00:04:10.220> blending<00:04:10.489> modes<00:04:10.700> will<00:04:10.910> look<00:04:11.000> even

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
of the blending modes will look even

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.390 
of the blending modes will look even
better<00:04:11.330> than<00:04:11.570> this

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.750 

any<00:04:15.400> of<00:04:15.640> them<00:04:15.790> made<00:04:16.000> image<00:04:16.329> much<00:04:16.600> too<00:04:16.840> dark<00:04:17.760> and

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
any of them made image much too dark and

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.909 
any of them made image much too dark and
I<00:04:19.180> think<00:04:19.419> I'm<00:04:19.540> gonna<00:04:19.720> select<00:04:20.079> overlay<00:04:20.560> once

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
I think I'm gonna select overlay once

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.730 
I think I'm gonna select overlay once
again<00:04:21.340> which<00:04:22.030> is<00:04:22.270> pretty<00:04:22.900> much<00:04:23.080> the<00:04:23.440> blending

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
again which is pretty much the blending

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.400 
again which is pretty much the blending
mode<00:04:23.889> that<00:04:24.040> I<00:04:24.130> tend<00:04:24.639> to<00:04:24.700> use<00:04:24.790> most<00:04:25.180> often<00:04:25.450> so

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
mode that I tend to use most often so

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.490 
mode that I tend to use most often so
I'll<00:04:26.500> tap<00:04:26.680> okay<00:04:27.360> and<00:04:28.360> now<00:04:28.690> I'll<00:04:28.870> just<00:04:28.900> adjust

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
I'll tap okay and now I'll just adjust

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:35.490 
I'll tap okay and now I'll just adjust
the<00:04:30.450> opacity<00:04:31.450> value<00:04:31.930> a<00:04:32.139> bit<00:04:33.120> and<00:04:34.169> I<00:04:35.169> think

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
the opacity value a bit and I think

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.670 
the opacity value a bit and I think
something<00:04:36.010> just<00:04:36.280> a<00:04:36.430> bit<00:04:36.580> over<00:04:36.820> 50<00:04:37.330> like<00:04:37.540> 55<00:04:38.380> can

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
something just a bit over 50 like 55 can

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.720 
something just a bit over 50 like 55 can
work<00:04:38.860> well<00:04:39.160> here<00:04:40.169> okay<00:04:41.169> I<00:04:41.470> think<00:04:42.220> this<00:04:42.520> looks

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
work well here okay I think this looks

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.390 
work well here okay I think this looks
really<00:04:42.880> really<00:04:43.480> really<00:04:43.810> nice<00:04:44.070> so<00:04:45.070> I'm<00:04:45.220> happy

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
really really really nice so I'm happy

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.980 
really really really nice so I'm happy
was<00:04:45.700> this<00:04:45.850> I'm<00:04:46.090> not<00:04:46.270> gonna<00:04:46.419> add<00:04:46.570> any<00:04:46.750> more

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
was this I'm not gonna add any more

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.590 
was this I'm not gonna add any more
layers<00:04:47.260> and<00:04:47.770> I<00:04:47.889> will<00:04:48.070> save<00:04:48.430> my<00:04:48.669> changes<00:04:49.270> to

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
layers and I will save my changes to

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.340 
layers and I will save my changes to
camera<00:04:49.930> roll<00:04:50.139> so<00:04:50.410> let's<00:04:50.800> have<00:04:50.919> the<00:04:51.010> Save<00:04:51.250> icon

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
camera roll so let's have the Save icon

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.690 
camera roll so let's have the Save icon
and<00:04:53.350> now<00:04:53.500> have<00:04:53.710> to<00:04:53.830> wait<00:04:53.950> for<00:04:54.160> the<00:04:54.250> image<00:04:54.430> to<00:04:54.460> be

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
and now have to wait for the image to be

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.440 
and now have to wait for the image to be
prepared<00:04:55.180> and<00:04:56.639> once<00:04:57.639> the<00:04:57.760> image<00:04:57.940> is<00:04:58.030> prepared

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
prepared and once the image is prepared

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.580 
prepared and once the image is prepared
I'm<00:04:58.600> gonna<00:04:58.810> save<00:04:59.080> it<00:04:59.110> to<00:04:59.290> photo<00:04:59.530> library<00:05:00.100> and

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
I'm gonna save it to photo library and

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.870 
I'm gonna save it to photo library and
that<00:05:02.590> concludes<00:05:03.010> this<00:05:03.340> tutorial<00:05:03.790> on<00:05:04.300> mixtures
