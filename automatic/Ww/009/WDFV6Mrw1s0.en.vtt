against I think that would according to
talking<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.420> my<00:01:57.570> mom<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:57.840> my<00:01:57.990> friend<00:01:58.320> like<00:01:58.649> is

Lambeau<00:04:32.430> and<00:04:32.580> I<00:04:32.610> know<00:04:32.670> it's<00:04:32.940> different

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
Lambeau and I know it's different

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.030 
Lambeau and I know it's different
because<00:04:33.480> there<00:04:33.630> are<00:04:33.690> no<00:04:33.780> racial<00:04:33.990> lines<00:04:34.380> that

he<00:04:37.350> should<00:04:37.680> have<00:04:37.800> been<00:04:37.980> because<00:04:38.370> he<00:04:38.400> was<00:04:38.670> the

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
he should have been because he was the

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.960 
he should have been because he was the
opposing<00:04:39.270> yeah<00:04:39.900> quarterback<00:04:40.500> period<00:04:41.280> the

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
opposing yeah quarterback period the

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.280

do believe they will see more of the
same<00:06:21.540> because<00:06:22.110> I<00:06:22.320> think<00:06:22.440> Michael<00:06:23.010> Vick<00:06:23.190> is

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340

going to light up that Stadium on Sunday
well<00:06:25.890> the<00:06:26.100> thing<00:06:26.310> is<00:06:26.340> the<00:06:26.640> stadium<00:06:26.880> you<00:06:27.150> were

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300
