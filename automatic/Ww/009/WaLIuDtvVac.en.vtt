flat two-dimensional image and
performance<00:02:25.430> being<00:02:25.700> a<00:02:26.000> present<00:02:26.510> time<00:02:26.810> and

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
performance being a present time and

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.450 
performance being a present time and
three-dimensional<00:02:28.820> space<00:02:29.150> and<00:02:30.280> trying<00:02:31.280> to

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
three-dimensional space and trying to

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.080 
three-dimensional space and trying to
put<00:02:31.670> these<00:02:31.790> two<00:02:32.470> opposites<00:02:33.550> in<00:02:34.550> relation<00:02:35.060> to

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
put these two opposites in relation to

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.680 
put these two opposites in relation to
each<00:02:35.210> other<00:02:35.450> and<00:02:36.970> trying<00:02:37.970> to<00:02:38.090> give<00:02:38.660> them

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
each other and trying to give them

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.680 
each other and trying to give them
different<00:02:39.080> roles<00:02:39.500> so<00:02:40.180> how<00:02:41.180> can<00:02:41.240> the

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
different roles so how can the

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.050 
different roles so how can the
photograph<00:02:42.170> become<00:02:42.590> more<00:02:42.770> alive<00:02:43.040> and<00:02:43.430> how<00:02:43.970> can

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
photograph become more alive and how can

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.630 
photograph become more alive and how can
the<00:02:44.540> performance<00:02:45.470> become<00:02:45.890> more<00:02:46.100> like<00:02:46.370> a

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
the performance become more like a

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.900 
the performance become more like a
memory<00:02:47.150> and<00:02:48.130> more<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:52.310> how<00:02:52.489> can<00:02:52.730> the<00:02:52.880> two

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
memory and more and how can the two

00:02:52.910 --> 00:03:04.460 
memory and more and how can the two
forms<00:02:53.510> talk<00:02:53.780> to<00:02:53.959> each<00:02:54.080> other

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.530
