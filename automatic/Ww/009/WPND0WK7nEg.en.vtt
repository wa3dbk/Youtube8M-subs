00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.880
 hi friends how are we now in this 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.230
 I bring you a little bit of opportunity 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.220
 news about what is happening 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.450
 on youtube I know a lot of 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.790
 you with all these changes that you have 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.860
 have suddenly seen that they have 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.420
 closed channels and well youtube 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.000
 now he's focusing a lot on channels 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.430
 of technology is focusing a lot on 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.059
 the channels dedicated especially to 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.300
 support are giving us many strikes 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.390
 they are reporting we are literally 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.210
 removing the channel this I have seen it with 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.969
 several channels of usa that I follow by 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.170
 example there is download blog they said 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.370
 that they already had their first 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.899
 admonition 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.239
 there are several channels out there enough 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.950
 great it seems to me that there are tweets too 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.750
 already says that they gave him the second one not after 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.820
 the second reprimand the second 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.670
 strike and you can not enter your account 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.619
 the first strike is like a warning 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.630
 the second strike not let you enter 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.340
 your account seems to me that of a week to 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.950
 ten days the truth I do not know very sure of 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.700
 how much are you and the third strike you 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.130
 they close your channel but the weird thing is that 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.380
 tells youtube because it gives you a kind 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.530
 of rule 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.450
 but it does not give you the exact reason it comes out 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.610
 well then I to prevent this and 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:30.079
 I deleted approximately 20 30 videos of 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.119
 powers applications because they were not 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:33.460
 legal a little bit of everything I started to 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.210
 erase to avoid problems 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.240
 fortunately the netbook with which 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.630
 I am today has responded well not 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.479
 I can complain this end has answered 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.130
 well the truth is I do not have this complaints but 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.710
 good video what I'm doing 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.890
 because I think everyone knows north 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.060
 north tutorials he is spanish I am 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.189
 sure you know him in fact 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.979
 he has many, he had many, many more 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.840
 subscribers that I and well I can not 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.539
 to say he was my great friend I can not 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.520
 say that all life we ​​talk to me 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.740
 street I really like the truth but 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.360
 very rarely have we talked and 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.110
 Well, I'm posting the news that the 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:15.590
 today April 16 they closed their 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.590
 channel goes out he already had two banns and 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.269
 in the meantime you can not enter your 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.980
 channel in that second strike that you get 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.470
 As I say, you can not enter your channel 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.760
 during a certain time then 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.960
 from that intermission they closed their channel 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.210
 unfortunately they took all his 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.820
 work because you have to be sincere 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.610
 imagine that you close a job you 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:41.000
 channel that you have been working for years 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.340
 terribly horrible and so for what 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.590
 I know he was already creating as his team 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.780
 of work already had in fact 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.120
 devices and was giving reports 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.160
 I was also driving devices 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.630
 Android not only apple but that 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.310
 and he was doing was growing 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.170
 making your channel grow more 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.730
 committing you Android devices is 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.830
 incredible and good, unfortunately 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.420
 they have closed their channel today I found out 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.840
 through his twitter that he closed his 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.970
 channel and well he has opened a new one 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.890
 they have closed their channel and immediately 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.890
 open a new one and you can find it 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.080
 as north tutorials come out I leave you 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.060

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.550
 link to your channel so they go and they 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.010
 subscribe not all who know him 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.440
 they know that really in a youtuber 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.840
 quite big very good and let's hope 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.989
 that with this, do not drop all your 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.130
 good job they have removed it but that 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.780
 it does not look down 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.890
 that he continues to throw all the kilos 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.960
 least of my part has the support 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.270
 he pulled the video and good friends not 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.440
 Here is a link to go on 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.060
 the description of the video can give you 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.920
 click and send them directly to 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.530
 your channel so that you subscribe in fact 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.540
 today I speak it already has 444 subscribers 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.320
 I hope you see it and good friends do not 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.030
 for me 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.550
 that's all nothing else is a small video 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.590
 informative youtube is pretty 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.390
 pretty rough with all this from the 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.520
 technology in technology channels in 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.500
 especially focused on apple has 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.480
 been shutting down a lot of channels like 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.490
 I tell you I've seen very large channels that 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.230
 have closed I have seen that the channel is very 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.730
 big 7 in his second reprimand 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.960
 I've seen very large channels that already 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.820
 they have their first warning their 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.560
 first strike and well let's hope 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.710
 that nothing happens to us all 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.900
 ways to have as a backup of 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:20.930
 everything is happening I'm thinking 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.760
 in creating a second channel for all this 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.530
 what it 's like to repeat is happening or not 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.330
 the one that are closing channels of 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.790
 technology focused especially to 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.740
 apple tells us by jailbreak that is in 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.610
 illegal usa 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.009
 in the rest of the world it is not illegal 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.810
 it's kind of weird, not at the end of the day 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:40.389
 all this is not how I'm going to repeat 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.819
 youtube does not tell you exactly why 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:44.860
 does not tell you why you are removing the 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:48.189
 channel do not tell you know what view of what 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:52.930
 I'm giving you a strike for the 

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:54.280
 jailbreak video ios 7 because this 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.500
 video is violating the rule of 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.419
 youtube delete it and ready do not do any more 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.219
 this kind of content does not tell you that 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:02.199
 youtube simply tells you you know that 

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:03.550
 here is your strike read the regulation 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:06.370
 I'm giving you but I'm not going to 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.500
 say why exactly I give out 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.360
 you draw your own conclusions 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.879
 delete videos that you think are convenient and 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.099
 ready and well it is quite difficult 

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:17.500
 do not imagine channels that carry 2 3 4 5 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:19.870
 6 7 8 9 10 years working I will be 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.000
 exaggerate but it's a say oceans of 34 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.830
 years running, it has so many 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.270
 videos and you would not know which one to delete 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.969
 better there are videos that have so many 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.009
 views and about you are being given as you 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:32.500
 I repeat again I would not know how to tell you 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:34.419
 exactly things but youtube is 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.340
 quite rough with the channels 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:38.110
 technology so good then all my 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.430
