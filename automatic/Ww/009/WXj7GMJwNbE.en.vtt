00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.280
 There is also Aihara 

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:13.480
 On the other hand, the whole of Japan 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:18.429
 Even when I was in Naha, I didn't come this way 

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:20.509
 It is thick on the side 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:24.300
 I wanted to play with two people while shooting 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:27.989
 I will specify this cat named Mitsuke 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.020
 When it leaks after saying Kumano Kodo 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.090
 You do what you want them to do 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.530
 100% but 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.980
 Even if it is full of eco carats, there is not so much 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.640
 I think 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.600
 When taking a taxi while taking photographs of the city's famous trees 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.320
 Always come from behind 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.660
 I wonder if the rest of this year 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.100
 Just a little look at who the accuracy is already 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.460
 It was 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.590
 s Is it weak when you see a talkative person in front? 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.410
 I refuse such a thing 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.280
 Is it troublesome? 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.280
 I have that feeling 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.020
 It is not before 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.660
 It is often said that the sea performer transferred to a government office or not 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:17.640
 Though 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.740
 I'm not interested in the word health 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.000
 In the most foreign phase 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.330
 Because the chairman is also interested in Kojiki 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.410
 Let's try it there if you can get the chance 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:28.240
 It is called 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.920
 Go to the map of Bake but Ibiki like that spokesman 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.670
 Such customers are pretty good 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.370
 It would be good if the votive could be continued if it could be prevented 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.420
 Bad man 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.580
 I have no idea what I want to do 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.500
 Behind the scenes are thinking something else 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.710
 I have greed once but 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.680
 Basically I thought it was alma mater 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.280
 It will open again when it comes to all things 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.170
 It was done 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.220
 Even if you are troubled there 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.490
 There was only one result 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.149
 I don't care how I understand it 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.369
 Mapras seven days-seven days but I do not know, but the flower ahead 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.549
 You will not invade if you want to 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.549
 It does not come to spread, but it spreads for the time being 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:13.480
 Of course 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.459
 I would like to get 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:17.660
 After all 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.159
 There was a moment when there was a chance 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:22.679
 It will be less if it does not come out 

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:26.589
 For the idea guts that are only going forward for the time being 

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:28.869
 There is 

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:30.609
 That 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:33.619
 From the time you spend each day if possible 

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:35.659
 Please stop for a moment 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:38.599
 I thought it was like having a look, but I left the cinema 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:39.429
 sometimes 

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:41.039
 Something 

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:43.449
 Something after the next two 

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:46.449
 I think it's a movie that you can think of 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.779
 If you're busy, you'll be busy looking for patents and time for an hour 

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:53.479
 I would like you to look at it
