00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.910
 Now I will show you how it works 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.350
 my new 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.639
 homemade stylus 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:12.639
 but differs from the others in that 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.639
 instead of some kind of gum or something 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:17.210
 something like that 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.509
 as the head itself is used 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:23.619
 ordinary piece of cotton moistened with water 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:27.409
 and so that the abadane would drip and then 

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:29.960
 his usual plastic bag 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.490
 it looks of course very very 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.880
 impressively 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.640
 but in principle you can still work on the forms 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.120
 And the idea in my opinion is very successful 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.570
 the fact is that you benefit from it 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.570
 compared to the rest of the stylus 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.410
 it is literally absolutely not necessary 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.190
 press to produce some sort of 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.190
 actions 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.310
 because if yakub use what 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.210
 some rubber stylus 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.470
 the plan comes pretty hard 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.880
 tap the screen and when you leave and on 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.760
 screen 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.400
 it turns out that he clings to the program 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.700
 interferes with work 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.040
 same stylus 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.240
 enough 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.760
 light touch 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.950
 so I literally hung here so important 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.940
 no pressing as well as a finger 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.570
 the usual 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.710
 back with it he 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.290
 100% work 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.290
 answer television stylus 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.220
 Well what can we say the principle of m can 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.220
 well 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.700
 work on his form come up 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.200
 some body place in 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.720
 plastic bag come up 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.390
 which one 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.720
 more durable stuff 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.720
 but it seems to me the idea is very worthwhile 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.190
 enter as much as he said 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.190
 very much 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.770
 but it is made of posts by bridges 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.910
 but for the experiment you can just 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.770
 take the usual fleece wrap a 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.800
 small bags don't pay directly on the screens you 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.839
 do you understand 

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:16.059
 how would I talk about when listed 

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.859
 advantage
