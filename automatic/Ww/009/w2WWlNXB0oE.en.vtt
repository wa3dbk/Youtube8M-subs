00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
escalator not a book elevator and

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.390 
escalator not a book elevator and
escalator<00:00:11.210> what<00:00:12.210> sort<00:00:12.540> of<00:00:12.570> like<00:00:12.719> an<00:00:12.870> escalator

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.400 
escalator what sort of like an escalator

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.250 
escalator what sort of like an escalator
basically<00:00:14.400> what<00:00:14.549> happens<00:00:15.210> is<00:00:15.299> you<00:00:15.780> go<00:00:15.900> on<00:00:16.080> to

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
basically what happens is you go on to

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.960 
basically what happens is you go on to
it<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.470> then<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:16.980> get<00:00:17.130> sort<00:00:17.369> of<00:00:17.490> pulled<00:00:17.760> up

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
it and then you get sort of pulled up

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.120 
it and then you get sort of pulled up
it's<00:00:18.420> actually<00:00:18.690> pretty<00:00:18.900> fast<00:00:19.260> so<00:00:19.770> it's<00:00:20.039> not

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
it's actually pretty fast so it's not

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.130 
it's actually pretty fast so it's not
like<00:00:20.310> normal<00:00:20.520> escalators<00:00:21.150> are<00:00:21.330> all<00:00:21.480> very<00:00:21.810> slow

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
like normal escalators are all very slow

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.710 
like normal escalators are all very slow
it<00:00:22.830> was<00:00:22.920> pretty<00:00:23.070> fast<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.670> as<00:00:23.820> they<00:00:24.060> quite<00:00:24.510> fun

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
it was pretty fast and as they quite fun

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.259 
it was pretty fast and as they quite fun
to<00:00:24.750> do<00:00:25.460> I'll<00:00:26.460> show<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:26.699> what<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:26.910> does<00:00:27.119> in<00:00:27.210> a

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
to do I'll show you what this does in a

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.509 
to do I'll show you what this does in a
second<00:00:27.660> it's<00:00:27.750> just<00:00:27.810> very<00:00:28.050> simple<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.710> piston

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
second it's just very simple a piston

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.470 
second it's just very simple a piston
door<00:00:29.699> so<00:00:30.570> that's<00:00:30.689> pretty<00:00:30.990> cool<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:32.360> see<00:00:33.360> how

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
door so that's pretty cool and I see how

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.459 
door so that's pretty cool and I see how
fast<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:33.960> gets<00:00:34.140> me<00:00:34.350> up<00:00:34.440> there<00:00:34.620> cute<00:00:35.460> Akins

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:36.469 
fast it gets me up there cute Akins

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:45.860 
fast it gets me up there cute Akins
right<00:00:43.250> 123456<00:00:44.250> basically<00:00:44.940> six<00:00:45.180> seconds<00:00:45.750> to

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
right 123456 basically six seconds to

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.310 
right 123456 basically six seconds to
get<00:00:46.079> up<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.550> far<00:00:47.550> it's<00:00:47.820> not<00:00:48.210> fastest<00:00:49.110> but

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
get up that far it's not fastest but

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.529 
get up that far it's not fastest but
it's<00:00:49.440> pretty<00:00:49.649> fast<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.120> just<00:00:51.270> a

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
it's pretty fast and this is just a

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.020 
it's pretty fast and this is just a
pretty<00:00:52.199> simple<00:00:52.500> thing<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.100> lets<00:00:53.460> me<00:00:53.520> drop<00:00:53.789> down

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
pretty simple thing it lets me drop down

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.450 
pretty simple thing it lets me drop down
into<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.390> water<00:00:54.510> again<00:00:55.160> nothing<00:00:56.160> spectacular

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
into the water again nothing spectacular

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.360 
into the water again nothing spectacular
there<00:00:57.300> but<00:00:58.079> I'm<00:00:58.199> just<00:00:58.410> going<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.590> go<00:00:58.770> over<00:00:58.800> how

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
there but I'm just going to go over how

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.160 
there but I'm just going to go over how
to<00:00:59.399> build<00:00:59.730> this<00:00:59.910> quickly<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.539> will<00:01:00.809> only<00:01:00.960> build

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
to build this quickly I will only build

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.840 
to build this quickly I will only build
a<00:01:01.320> couple<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.680> levels<00:01:01.890> just<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.609> get<00:01:02.730> the

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
a couple of levels just so you get the

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.670 
a couple of levels just so you get the
basics<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.629> can<00:01:03.750> build<00:01:03.960> as<00:01:04.170> much<00:01:04.350> as<00:01:04.559> you

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
basics and you can build as much as you

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.130 
basics and you can build as much as you
want<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.820> can<00:01:06.000> be<00:01:06.090> used<00:01:06.270> for<00:01:06.420> like<00:01:06.689> some<00:01:06.930> sort

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
want it can be used for like some sort

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.090 
want it can be used for like some sort
of<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:08.990> entrance<00:01:09.990> way<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.439> base<00:01:10.770> or

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
of and entrance way to a base or

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.710 
of and entrance way to a base or
something<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.670> could<00:01:11.820> make<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.119> wider<00:01:12.360> I'm

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
something you could make it wider I'm

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.190 
something you could make it wider I'm
sure<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.280> I<00:01:14.390> it's<00:01:15.390> pretty<00:01:15.689> probably<00:01:16.020> pretty

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
sure and I it's pretty probably pretty

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.520 
sure and I it's pretty probably pretty
easy<00:01:16.439> just<00:01:16.650> extend<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.460> add<00:01:17.930> signs<00:01:18.930> on<00:01:19.409> to

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
easy just extend it and add signs on to

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.090 
easy just extend it and add signs on to
each<00:01:19.650> other<00:01:19.970> but<00:01:20.970> anyway<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.600> am<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.799> could<00:01:22.950> use

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
four base this is what we're gonna start

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.760 
four base this is what we're gonna start
off<00:01:53.850> with<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.720> don't<00:01:54.930> need<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.229> store<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.710> it

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
off with you don't need to store and it

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.680 
off with you don't need to store and it
could<00:01:55.920> be<00:01:56.009> basically<00:01:56.549> any

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
could be basically any

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.810 
could be basically any
and<00:01:57.840> building<00:01:58.740> structure<00:01:59.160> you<00:01:59.280> need<00:01:59.460> our

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
and building structure you need our

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.360 
and building structure you need our
building<00:02:00.780> block<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.200> want<00:02:01.440> anything<00:02:02.250> from

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
building block you want anything from

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.800 
building block you want anything from
here<00:02:02.640> I<00:02:02.700> think<00:02:02.940> should<00:02:03.210> work<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:05.510> should<00:02:06.510> I'm

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
here I think should work and should I'm

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.420 
here I think should work and should I'm
not<00:02:06.990> hundred<00:02:07.320> percent<00:02:07.560> sure<00:02:07.620> how<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:07.980> tasted

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:08.430 
not hundred percent sure how it tasted

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.850 
not hundred percent sure how it tasted
everything<00:02:09.020> but<00:02:10.020> anyway<00:02:10.320> so<00:02:10.590> what<00:02:10.740> you're

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
everything but anyway so what you're

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.980 
everything but anyway so what you're
going<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.040> want<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.340> do<00:02:11.490> is<00:02:11.700> before<00:02:12.630> you<00:02:12.870> do

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
going to want to do is before you do

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.900 
going to want to do is before you do
anything<00:02:13.410> like<00:02:13.740> taking<00:02:14.250> away<00:02:14.430> stuff<00:02:14.670> see<00:02:14.820> if

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
anything like taking away stuff see if

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.630 
anything like taking away stuff see if
you<00:02:15.000> just<00:02:15.210> took<00:02:15.330> away<00:02:15.570> stuff<00:02:15.870> here<00:02:16.280> you'd<00:02:17.280> stop

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
you just took away stuff here you'd stop

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.310 
you just took away stuff here you'd stop
bless<00:02:17.880> at<00:02:18.150> this<00:02:18.360> point<00:02:18.660> so<00:02:18.900> what<00:02:19.050> you're<00:02:19.170> good

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
bless at this point so what you're good

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.800 
bless at this point so what you're good
to<00:02:19.410> want<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.710> do<00:02:19.910> is<00:02:20.910> actually<00:02:21.090> go<00:02:21.360> underneath

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
to want to do is actually go underneath

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.740 
to want to do is actually go underneath
and<00:02:22.260> then<00:02:22.290> not<00:02:23.130> go<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.340> rate<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.700> end<00:02:23.910> but<00:02:24.330> four

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
and then not go to rate the end but four

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.830 
and then not go to rate the end but four
blocks<00:02:25.110> if<00:02:25.890> you<00:02:26.010> go<00:02:26.130> to<00:02:26.160> what<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.550> take<00:02:26.730> up<00:02:26.940> so

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
blocks if you go to what to take up so

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.440 
blocks if you go to what to take up so
you're<00:02:28.110> not<00:02:28.320> taking<00:02:28.770> up<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.130> very<00:02:29.340> back<00:02:29.940> but

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
you're not taking up the very back but

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.910 
you're not taking up the very back but
just<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:32.190> middle<00:02:32.520> to<00:02:33.260> write<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.440> start<00:02:34.710> so

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
just the middle to write to start so

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.070 
just the middle to write to start so
basically<00:02:35.220> what<00:02:35.370> happens<00:02:35.790> is<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:37.050> water

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
basically what happens is the water

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.720 
basically what happens is the water
flows<00:02:37.770> and<00:02:37.950> you're<00:02:38.070> going<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.340> want<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.520> dig

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
flows and you're going to want to dig

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.360 
flows and you're going to want to dig
for<00:02:39.000> long<00:02:39.860> so<00:02:40.860> basically<00:02:41.100> you've<00:02:41.250> got<00:02:41.340> a

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
for long so basically you've got a

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.980 
for long so basically you've got a
flowing<00:02:41.760> water<00:02:41.970> so<00:02:42.300> this<00:02:42.450> is<00:02:42.600> what<00:02:42.810> I'm

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
flowing water so this is what I'm

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.980 
flowing water so this is what I'm
happens<00:02:43.860> when<00:02:44.010> you<00:02:44.130> go<00:02:44.220> in<00:02:44.310> your<00:02:44.430> boat<00:02:44.990> look

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
happens when you go in your boat look

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.400 
happens when you go in your boat look
mate<00:02:46.680> good<00:02:47.130> flying<00:02:47.310> boat<00:02:47.750> go<00:02:48.750> on<00:02:48.870> boat<00:02:49.080> you<00:02:49.230> can

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
mate good flying boat go on boat you can

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.340 
mate good flying boat go on boat you can
do<00:02:49.590> it<00:02:50.120> basically<00:02:51.120> that's<00:02:51.240> what<00:02:51.420> gets<00:02:51.960> you<00:02:52.170> the

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
do it basically that's what gets you the

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.560 
do it basically that's what gets you the
a.m<00:02:52.530> pushes<00:02:53.340> you<00:02:53.460> into<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.880> current<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.480> the

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
a.m pushes you into the current and the

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.350 
a.m pushes you into the current and the
first<00:02:54.810> place<00:02:55.280> so<00:02:56.280> what<00:02:56.880> you're<00:02:57.000> going<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.150> need

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
first place so what you're going to need

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.220 
first place so what you're going to need
is<00:02:57.570> a<00:02:57.630> lot<00:02:58.140> of<00:02:58.260> signs<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:59.150> lot<00:03:00.150> of<00:03:00.390> signs<00:03:00.780> because

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
is a lot of signs a lot of signs because

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.440 
is a lot of signs a lot of signs because
you're<00:03:01.440> going<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:01.680> need<00:03:01.739> a<00:03:02.180> basically<00:03:03.180> six

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
you're going to need a basically six

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.229 
you're going to need a basically six
signs<00:03:03.810> for<00:03:04.380> every<00:03:04.670> level<00:03:05.670> you<00:03:05.760> could<00:03:05.910> want<00:03:06.090> you

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
signs for every level you could want you

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.220 
signs for every level you could want you
to<00:03:06.390> do<00:03:06.680> so<00:03:07.850> now<00:03:08.850> we've<00:03:09.030> got<00:03:09.239> these<00:03:09.360> four<00:03:09.959> things

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
to do so now we've got these four things

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.199 
to do so now we've got these four things
here<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.130> the<00:03:11.459> other<00:03:12.050> two<00:03:13.250> bits<00:03:14.250> there<00:03:14.520> what

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
here and the other two bits there what

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.280 
here and the other two bits there what
you're<00:03:15.330> going<00:03:15.450> to<00:03:15.510> want<00:03:15.600> to<00:03:15.660> do<00:03:15.870> is<00:03:16.050> leave<00:03:16.260> a

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
you're going to want to do is leave a

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.640 
you're going to want to do is leave a
space<00:03:16.680> at<00:03:16.950> these<00:03:17.400> bits<00:03:17.780> on<00:03:18.780> top<00:03:18.840> of<00:03:19.170> these<00:03:19.290> and

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
space at these bits on top of these and

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.430 
space at these bits on top of these and
ain't<00:03:19.920> build<00:03:20.190> along<00:03:20.489> seven<00:03:21.300> so<00:03:22.110> it's<00:03:22.230> four

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
ain't build along seven so it's four

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.310 
ain't build along seven so it's four
five<00:03:22.800> six<00:03:23.190> seven<00:03:23.580> and<00:03:23.970> you<00:03:24.750> really<00:03:24.989> think<00:03:25.170> wow

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
five six seven and you really think wow

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.350 
five six seven and you really think wow
that's<00:03:25.620> quite<00:03:25.830> a<00:03:25.890> long<00:03:26.130> thing<00:03:26.519> it<00:03:27.180> doesn't

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
that's quite a long thing it doesn't

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.120 
that's quite a long thing it doesn't
have<00:03:27.480> you<00:03:27.690> look<00:03:27.870> like<00:03:28.080> that<00:03:28.380> another<00:03:28.650> one<00:03:28.890> but

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
have you look like that another one but

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.970 
have you look like that another one but
actually<00:03:29.550> it<00:03:29.700> is<00:03:30.200> if<00:03:31.200> you<00:03:31.320> look<00:03:31.470> along<00:03:31.590> here

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
actually it is if you look along here

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.120 
actually it is if you look along here
it's<00:03:32.100> one<00:03:32.280> two<00:03:32.489> three<00:03:32.760> four<00:03:33.269> five<00:03:33.300> six<00:03:33.600> seven

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
it's one two three four five six seven

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.290 
it's one two three four five six seven
it<00:03:35.130> doesn't<00:03:35.459> actually<00:03:35.550> look<00:03:35.820> like<00:03:35.880> that<00:03:36.209> and

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
it doesn't actually look like that and

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.800 
it doesn't actually look like that and
I<00:03:37.360> just<00:03:38.020> looks<00:03:38.230> like<00:03:38.320> the<00:03:38.590> three<00:03:39.580> blocks<00:03:39.910> that

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
I just looks like the three blocks that

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.300 
I just looks like the three blocks that
you<00:03:40.930> move<00:03:41.140> along<00:03:41.440> but<00:03:41.740> the<00:03:41.830> seven<00:03:42.190> blocks

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
you move along but the seven blocks

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.610 
you move along but the seven blocks
there<00:03:42.670> and<00:03:42.820> I<00:03:42.880> just<00:03:43.150> really<00:03:43.390> helps<00:03:43.690> me<00:03:44.020> to<00:03:44.440> make

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
there and I just really helps me to make

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.820 
there and I just really helps me to make
it<00:03:44.830> because<00:03:45.730> I'm<00:03:46.150> generally<00:03:46.930> pretty<00:03:47.110> bad<00:03:47.650> at

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
it because I'm generally pretty bad at

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.030 
it because I'm generally pretty bad at
this<00:03:47.950> so<00:03:48.190> far<00:03:48.460> because<00:03:48.760> I<00:03:49.740> only<00:03:50.740> just<00:03:50.950> found

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
this so far because I only just found

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.190 
this so far because I only just found
this<00:03:51.280> out<00:03:51.400> today<00:03:51.730> I<00:03:51.760> hadn't<00:03:52.720> thought<00:03:52.930> of<00:03:52.990> it

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
this out today I hadn't thought of it

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.200 
this out today I hadn't thought of it
before<00:03:53.350> I<00:03:53.590> just<00:03:53.860> randomly<00:03:54.490> popped<00:03:54.790> into<00:03:55.030> my

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.210 
before I just randomly popped into my

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.240 
before I just randomly popped into my
head<00:03:55.240> like<00:03:55.750> why<00:03:56.410> do<00:03:56.470> I<00:03:56.590> build<00:03:56.890> a<00:03:57.040> boat

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
head like why do I build a boat

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.920 
head like why do I build a boat
escalator<00:03:57.910> hand<00:03:58.240> you<00:03:58.330> can<00:03:58.480> see<00:03:58.630> there's<00:03:58.810> a

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
escalator hand you can see there's a

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.920 
escalator hand you can see there's a
little<00:03:59.110> trial<00:03:59.800> and<00:04:00.100> error<00:04:00.370> thing<00:04:00.520> there<00:04:01.030> this

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
little trial and error thing there this

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.200 
little trial and error thing there this
doesn't<00:04:02.170> work<00:04:02.440> you<00:04:02.680> need<00:04:02.860> actual<00:04:03.340> two<00:04:03.910> bits

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.210 
doesn't work you need actual two bits

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.660 
doesn't work you need actual two bits
before<00:04:04.390> and<00:04:05.290> our<00:04:05.770> else<00:04:06.160> you<00:04:06.340> just<00:04:06.490> sort<00:04:06.610> of

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
before and our else you just sort of

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.740 
before and our else you just sort of
whack<00:04:06.910> into<00:04:07.300> these<00:04:07.450> a<00:04:08.850> blocks<00:04:09.850> and<00:04:10.150> break<00:04:10.600> your

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
whack into these a blocks and break your

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.710 
whack into these a blocks and break your
boat<00:04:11.020> which<00:04:11.320> is<00:04:11.500> not<00:04:11.770> what<00:04:11.800> you<00:04:12.040> want<00:04:12.510> so<00:04:13.510> I'll

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
boat which is not what you want so I'll

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.560 
boat which is not what you want so I'll
be<00:04:13.900> back<00:04:14.110> to<00:04:14.290> this<00:04:14.440> bit<00:04:14.680> here<00:04:15.150> so<00:04:16.150> now<00:04:16.390> we've

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
be back to this bit here so now we've

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.440 
be back to this bit here so now we've
got<00:04:16.720> this<00:04:16.989> if<00:04:17.320> you<00:04:17.530> put<00:04:18.130> water<00:04:18.370> in<00:04:18.730> it<00:04:18.940> won't<00:04:19.209> go

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
got this if you put water in it won't go

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.070 
got this if you put water in it won't go
back<00:04:19.780> the<00:04:20.049> way<00:04:20.200> or<00:04:20.470> go<00:04:20.739> forward<00:04:21.360> yeah<00:04:22.360> but<00:04:22.960> it

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
back the way or go forward yeah but it

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.690 
back the way or go forward yeah but it
just<00:04:23.230> goes<00:04:23.440> off<00:04:23.620> and<00:04:23.920> you<00:04:24.040> want<00:04:24.220> to<00:04:24.310> make<00:04:24.460> color

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
just goes off and you want to make color

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.210 
just goes off and you want to make color
levels<00:04:25.630> so<00:04:26.380> we're<00:04:26.530> going<00:04:26.710> towards<00:04:26.950> our<00:04:27.070> just

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
levels so we're going towards our just

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.370 
levels so we're going towards our just
go<00:04:27.370> along<00:04:27.550> for<00:04:27.880> from<00:04:28.090> this<00:04:28.300> block<00:04:28.570> so<00:04:28.780> one<00:04:28.990> two

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
go along for from this block so one two

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.010 
go along for from this block so one two
three<00:04:29.860> four<00:04:30.280> and<00:04:30.550> go<00:04:30.970> to<00:04:31.030> build<00:04:31.300> up<00:04:31.540> and<00:04:31.840> go

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
three four and go to build up and go

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.640 
three four and go to build up and go
along<00:04:32.260> six<00:04:32.620> I<00:04:33.870> go<00:04:34.870> what<00:04:35.110> to<00:04:35.230> do<00:04:35.350> that<00:04:35.500> on<00:04:35.620> both

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
along six I go what to do that on both

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.540 
along six I go what to do that on both
sides<00:04:37.200> so<00:04:38.200> basically<00:04:38.590> that's<00:04:38.950> going<00:04:39.280> along

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
sides so basically that's going along

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:40.830 
sides so basically that's going along
seven<00:04:40.000> because<00:04:40.150> you're<00:04:40.300> building<00:04:40.570> up<00:04:40.660> one

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
seven because you're building up one

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.460 
seven because you're building up one
good<00:04:41.080> 961<00:04:41.830> plus<00:04:42.100> six<00:04:42.370> equals<00:04:42.550> seven<00:04:43.210> hurry<00:04:44.080> we

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
good 961 plus six equals seven hurry we

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.540 
good 961 plus six equals seven hurry we
can<00:04:44.500> do<00:04:44.740> maths<00:04:45.600> then<00:04:46.600> go<00:04:46.810> and<00:04:46.990> place<00:04:47.320> a<00:04:47.350> sane<00:04:47.740> at

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
can do maths then go and place a sane at

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.270 
can do maths then go and place a sane at
the<00:04:48.610> very<00:04:48.940> first<00:04:49.180> block<00:04:49.510> that<00:04:49.720> it<00:04:49.840> goes<00:04:50.020> up

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
the very first block that it goes up

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.380 
the very first block that it goes up
this<00:04:51.280> will<00:04:51.460> be<00:04:51.550> to<00:04:51.700> stop<00:04:51.910> the<00:04:52.060> water<00:04:52.240> from

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
this will be to stop the water from

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.780 
this will be to stop the water from
falling<00:04:53.020> back<00:04:53.230> like<00:04:53.710> this<00:04:53.919> one<00:04:54.190> I<00:04:54.220> was<00:04:54.490> and

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
falling back like this one I was and

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.020 
falling back like this one I was and
then<00:04:55.540> you're<00:04:55.720> gonna<00:04:55.870> want<00:04:56.110> to<00:04:56.260> build<00:04:56.710> our

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
then you're gonna want to build our

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.560 
then you're gonna want to build our
place<00:04:58.030> signs<00:04:58.390> in<00:04:58.720> these<00:04:59.380> two<00:04:59.650> sports<00:04:59.950> and<00:05:00.850> then

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
place signs in these two sports and then

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
place signs in these two sports and then
fill<00:05:02.440> that<00:05:02.590> off<00:05:02.800> with<00:05:03.340> a<00:05:04.050> store<00:05:05.050> or<00:05:05.080> whatever

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
fill that off with a store or whatever

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.800 
fill that off with a store or whatever
building<00:05:06.130> material<00:05:06.550> you're<00:05:06.730> using<00:05:07.000> you<00:05:07.660> can

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
building material you're using you can

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.520 
building material you're using you can
actually<00:05:08.200> fill<00:05:08.620> that<00:05:08.740> up<00:05:08.800> with<00:05:09.190> em<00:05:10.320> sayings<00:05:11.320> if

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
actually fill that up with em sayings if

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.670 
actually fill that up with em sayings if
you<00:05:11.770> wish<00:05:12.130> you<00:05:12.910> don't<00:05:13.090> need<00:05:13.330> to<00:05:13.390> I<00:05:13.780> am<00:05:13.900> it's

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
you wish you don't need to I am it's

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.740 
you wish you don't need to I am it's
probably<00:05:14.860> more<00:05:15.210> effective<00:05:16.210> to<00:05:16.240> just<00:05:16.360> use<00:05:16.720> a

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
probably more effective to just use a

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.330 
probably more effective to just use a
building<00:05:17.260> block<00:05:17.580> because<00:05:18.870> sayings<00:05:19.870> are<00:05:20.020> quail

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
building block because sayings are quail

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.330 
building block because sayings are quail
quite<00:05:21.340> annoying<00:05:21.610> to<00:05:21.790> build<00:05:22.030> I<00:05:22.530> am<00:05:23.530> required

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
quite annoying to build I am required

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.640 
quite annoying to build I am required
quite<00:05:24.700> low<00:05:24.850> would<00:05:25.180> if<00:05:25.300> you're<00:05:25.419> using<00:05:25.630> six<00:05:26.169> or<00:05:26.470> a

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.680 
quite low would if you're using six or a

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
quite would intensive so I just use

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.260 
quite would intensive so I just use
blocks<00:05:32.410> even<00:05:33.280> though<00:05:33.370> I'm<00:05:33.490> creative<00:05:34.090> it's

blocks even though I'm creative it's

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:35.850 
blocks even though I'm creative it's
probably<00:05:34.660> better<00:05:34.930> for<00:05:35.080> you<00:05:35.350> guys<00:05:35.530> to<00:05:35.680> use

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
probably better for you guys to use

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.920 
probably better for you guys to use
