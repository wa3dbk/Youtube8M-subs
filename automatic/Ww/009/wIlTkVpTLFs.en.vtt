00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.469
 good and good boys and girls friends 

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:05.060
 from digital miriam that as you are 

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:07.279
 today trujillo and we are here in a video 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.490
 very quick I 'm going to do to 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:14.510
 show you how to get the costume 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:17.210
 diving to be able to do that and investigate 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.560
 there in the depths without having the 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.210
 submarine because I for example still 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.640
 I do not have it and I'm investigating and 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.830
 it seems to be right here so nothing 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.490
 we go direct what you have to do is 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.460
 I just throw my car that I have 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:34.190
 what you have to do is simply 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:37.310
 get on the boat is something like 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:40.489
 call and when you go down and when you jump into the water 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.090
 directly you will put the suit of 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.780
 diving 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.780
 that is the boat 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.690
 to make it clearer I'm going to teach it 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.910
 well in the map you see here we are in 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.680
 the port that is this part of here then 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.120
 up to here it is simply easy and 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.730
 simple I think okay let's get ourselves 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.750
 as you see now I have nothing 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.540
 of diving or stories and now when catching 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.850
 the launch is supposed to be like 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.510
 We team and I guess we're left 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.600
 saved forever 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.520
 what the hell he puts on, they put on 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.950
 co-pilot position 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.140
 well, the boat does not know if it's okay or 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.060
 no i am not very to use boats in this 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.430
 game 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.810
 and what I do not know if it was saved for the 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.000
 three characters or we'll have to come 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.850
 here with each one I guess with that 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.070
 let's come with one will be worth it because 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.880
 difficult to discover it is not worth 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.270
 we throw to the water 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.610
 and there it appears to us already the one of buzz 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.150
 Hello 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.590
 the cylinder is oxygen and where it comes out 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.750
 the 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.350
 what's this called the ability to 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.869
 breathing that becomes the bar 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.030
 yellow in blue because we see that it continues 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:59.109
 yellow and it does not lower us so nothing 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.909
 I guess now we can investigate 

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:04.130
 the seabed that promised us that 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.649
 there was up to a floor of 12 if a floor of 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.080
 12 plants submerged in the water too 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.879
 the interest that there is out there of the UFO 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.290
 crashed that I'll try to upload 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:14.050
 another day 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.430
 So nothing 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:20.320
 this is all since they talk nicer 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.180
 or if that has been useful already you know you can 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.920
 give I like to share it with you 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.280
 colleagues out there on twitter and facebook 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.710
 so that they also find out and little 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.140
 more if you are not subscribed to the channel 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.700
 still then pass and if you like what 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.260
 that you have to subscribe and nothing a greeting 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.470
 and until next time 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.470
 goodbye
