it was made in 1986 to the public these

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.400 
it was made in 1986 to the public these
locks<00:00:34.820> apparently<00:00:35.820> cost<00:00:36.540> around<00:00:36.809> twelve

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
locks apparently cost around twelve

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.690

hundred<00:00:37.500> dollars<00:00:38.040> each

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
hundred dollars each

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.170 
hundred dollars each
however<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:40.200> military<00:00:40.440> buys<00:00:41.309> them<00:00:41.700> ten

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
however the military buys them ten

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.319 
however the military buys them ten
thousand<00:00:42.780> at<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.960> time<00:00:43.820> so<00:00:44.820> they<00:00:44.940> get<00:00:45.090> something

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
thousand at a time so they get something

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.170 
thousand at a time so they get something
like<00:00:45.719> an<00:00:46.010> $1,100<00:00:47.010> discount<00:00:47.579> so<00:00:47.820> they<00:00:47.940> end<00:00:48.059> up

corrections to my last video I did on

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.619 
corrections to my last video I did on
this<00:01:01.530> log<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.309> now<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.910> first<00:01:03.359> thing<00:01:03.480> I'm

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
this log and now the first thing I'm

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.719 
this log and now the first thing I'm
going<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.840> talk<00:01:03.960> about<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.409> key<00:01:04.729> these

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
going to talk about is the key these

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.990 
going to talk about is the key these
locks<00:01:06.030> generally<00:01:06.540> come<00:01:06.780> with<00:01:07.500> an<00:01:08.000> operating

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
locks generally come with an operating

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.160 
locks generally come with an operating
key<00:01:09.680> usually<00:01:10.680> two<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:12.180> control<00:01:12.630> key<00:01:12.869> and

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
key usually two and a control key and

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.380 
key usually two and a control key and
the<00:01:13.650> only<00:01:13.799> difference<00:01:14.130> between<00:01:14.820> the

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
the only difference between the

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.560 
the only difference between the
operating<00:01:15.840> key<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.619> control<00:01:16.770> key<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:18.240> the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
operating key and the control key is the

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.530 
operating key and the control key is the
fact<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.350> control<00:01:19.799> key<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.670> has<00:01:20.729> no

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
fact that the control key it has no

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.480 
fact that the control key it has no
shoulder<00:01:22.130> which<00:01:23.180> allows<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:25.100> let's<00:01:26.100> return

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
shoulder which allows it let's return

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.300 
shoulder which allows it let's return
back<00:01:27.470> in<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.710> key<00:01:29.430> way<00:01:30.470> the<00:01:31.470> operating<00:01:31.979> key

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
back in the key way the operating key

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.910 
back in the key way the operating key
has<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.000> shoulder<00:01:33.360> on<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.350> can<00:01:34.500> only<00:01:34.590> be

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
has a shoulder on it so it can only be

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.120 
has a shoulder on it so it can only be
turned<00:01:35.240> in<00:01:38.119> the<00:01:39.119> clockwise<00:01:39.420> direction<00:01:40.130> to

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
turned in the clockwise direction to

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:48.179 
turned in the clockwise direction to
operate<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.790> lock<00:01:42.740> now<00:01:44.479> the<00:01:45.479> control<00:01:45.960> key

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
operate the lock now the control key

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.910 
operate the lock now the control key
it<00:01:49.189> has<00:01:49.340> no<00:01:49.640> shoulder<00:01:50.180> so<00:01:50.540> it<00:01:50.720> can<00:01:50.869> it<00:01:51.409> can<00:01:51.470> turn

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
it has no shoulder so it can it can turn

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:59.550 
it has no shoulder so it can it can turn
back<00:01:52.189> past<00:01:53.530> this<00:01:56.619> shrouded<00:01:57.619> area<00:01:58.040> here<00:01:58.369> so

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
back past this shrouded area here so

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.929 
back past this shrouded area here so
what<00:02:00.560> I've<00:02:00.680> done<00:02:00.890> is<00:02:00.950> I<00:02:01.250> filed<00:02:01.640> off<00:02:01.909> the

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
what I've done is I filed off the

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:06.149 
what I've done is I filed off the
shoulder<00:02:02.540> on<00:02:02.780> my<00:02:02.899> operating<00:02:03.380> key<00:02:03.880> to<00:02:04.880> make<00:02:05.299> it

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
shoulder on my operating key to make it

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.309 
shoulder on my operating key to make it
an<00:02:07.159> operating<00:02:07.670> key<00:02:07.820> as<00:02:08.030> well<00:02:08.390> as<00:02:08.750> a<00:02:08.869> control

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
an operating key as well as a control

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.979 
an operating key as well as a control
key<00:02:09.640> so<00:02:10.640> I'm<00:02:10.850> gonna<00:02:11.000> go<00:02:11.120> ahead<00:02:11.239> and<00:02:11.360> turn<00:02:11.780> the

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
key so I'm gonna go ahead and turn the

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.270 
key so I'm gonna go ahead and turn the
control<00:02:12.380> key<00:02:12.650> in<00:02:12.770> the<00:02:12.860> counterclockwise

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
control key in the counterclockwise

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.059 
control key in the counterclockwise
direction<00:02:14.890> which<00:02:15.890> opens<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.519> lock<00:02:17.830> then<00:02:18.830> this

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
direction which opens the lock then this

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.130 
direction which opens the lock then this
piece<00:02:19.340> here<00:02:19.640> comes<00:02:19.910> out<00:02:20.680> that<00:02:21.680> aside<00:02:22.069> you<00:02:23.140> turn

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
piece here comes out that aside you turn

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.490 
piece here comes out that aside you turn
the<00:02:24.260> shackle<00:02:24.680> all<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:24.920> way<00:02:25.040> around<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:29.500> the

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
the shackle all the way around and the

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:38.530 
the shackle all the way around and the
next<00:02:30.650> piece<00:02:34.360> is<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.720> locking<00:02:35.930> member<00:02:37.540> which

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
next piece is the locking member which

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.509 
next piece is the locking member which
is<00:02:38.720> there<00:02:40.390> that's<00:02:41.390> the<00:02:41.630> locking<00:02:42.049> bar<00:02:42.519> that

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
is there that's the locking bar that

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.289 
is there that's the locking bar that
when<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.569> lock<00:02:44.810> is<00:02:44.840> in<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.200> locked<00:02:45.500> position

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
when the lock is in the locked position

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:59.080 
when the lock is in the locked position
would<00:02:47.299> sit<00:02:49.360> right<00:02:50.360> in<00:02:50.569> there<00:02:57.100> okay<00:02:58.100> I<00:02:58.340> made<00:02:59.060> a

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
would sit right in there okay I made a

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.150 
would sit right in there okay I made a
mistake<00:02:59.239> in<00:02:59.750> my<00:02:59.810> last<00:03:00.140> one<00:03:00.410> I<00:03:00.620> said<00:03:00.890> that<00:03:01.070> it

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
mistake in my last one I said that it

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.190 
mistake in my last one I said that it
had<00:03:01.310> a<00:03:01.340> dual<00:03:01.640> ball<00:03:01.910> locking<00:03:02.359> mechanism

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
had a dual ball locking mechanism

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.720 
had a dual ball locking mechanism
because<00:03:03.500> that's<00:03:03.709> what<00:03:03.890> I<00:03:03.920> was<00:03:04.100> told<00:03:04.340> I<00:03:04.579> was

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
because that's what I was told I was

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.120 
because that's what I was told I was
quite<00:03:04.970> misinformed<00:03:05.720> so<00:03:06.290> I'm<00:03:06.410> gonna<00:03:06.560> try<00:03:07.070> and

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
quite misinformed so I'm gonna try and

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.099 
quite misinformed so I'm gonna try and
correct<00:03:07.430> all<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:07.730> mistakes<00:03:07.880> that<00:03:08.390> I<00:03:08.510> made<00:03:08.780> in

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:09.109 
correct all the mistakes that I made in

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:17.560 
correct all the mistakes that I made in
my<00:03:09.560> last<00:03:10.220> review<00:03:10.579> of<00:03:10.760> this<00:03:11.000> lock<00:03:14.709> or<00:03:16.420> pull<00:03:17.420> the

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
my last review of this lock or pull the

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:24.520 
my last review of this lock or pull the
key<00:03:20.170> and<00:03:21.170> out<00:03:21.920> comes<00:03:22.220> the<00:03:22.400> cord<00:03:22.670> now<00:03:23.350> this<00:03:24.350> is<00:03:24.500> a

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
key and out comes the cord now this is a

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:32.500 
key and out comes the cord now this is a
6<00:03:24.890> pin<00:03:25.160> medical<00:03:26.140> biaxial<00:03:27.140> core<00:03:28.600> and<00:03:30.519> as<00:03:31.519> most

6 pin medical biaxial core and as most

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.289 
6 pin medical biaxial core and as most
of<00:03:32.690> you<00:03:32.780> probably<00:03:32.930> already<00:03:33.440> know<00:03:34.510> medico<00:03:35.510> pins

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
of you probably already know medico pins

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.470 
of you probably already know medico pins
have<00:03:38.299> to<00:03:38.480> be<00:03:38.600> rotated<00:03:39.230> as<00:03:39.500> well<00:03:40.010> as<00:03:40.190> lifted<00:03:40.670> so

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
have to be rotated as well as lifted so

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.430 
have to be rotated as well as lifted so
the<00:03:41.720> key<00:03:41.900> cuts<00:03:42.170> are<00:03:42.380> on<00:03:42.410> angles<00:03:43.130> you<00:03:44.000> have

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
the key cuts are on angles you have

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.360 
the key cuts are on angles you have
angle<00:03:45.440> left<00:03:45.700> angle<00:03:46.700> right<00:03:47.650> angle<00:03:48.650> aft<00:03:48.920> an

angle left angle right angle aft an

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.770 
angle left angle right angle aft an
angle<00:03:50.209> for<00:03:50.600> this

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
angle for this

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.880 
angle for this
you<00:03:52.319> have<00:03:52.470> four<00:03:52.709> different<00:03:52.920> angles<00:03:53.069> there<00:03:53.550> and

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
you have four different angles there and

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.770 
you have four different angles there and
the<00:03:55.890> purpose<00:03:56.220> of<00:03:56.400> these<00:03:56.550> angles<00:03:57.060> is<00:03:57.270> to<00:03:57.540> rotate

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
the purpose of these angles is to rotate

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.160 
the purpose of these angles is to rotate
the<00:03:58.020> pins<00:03:58.440> because<00:03:58.830> the<00:03:59.790> pins<00:04:00.090> not<00:04:00.540> only<00:04:00.870> must

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
the pins because the pins not only must

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.190 
the pins because the pins not only must
be<00:04:01.350> lifted<00:04:01.770> to<00:04:02.190> the<00:04:02.280> shear<00:04:02.520> line<00:04:03.020> but<00:04:04.020> they

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
be lifted to the shear line but they

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.600 
be lifted to the shear line but they
must<00:04:04.440> be<00:04:04.530> rotated<00:04:05.840> so<00:04:06.840> that<00:04:07.080> a<00:04:07.350> slot<00:04:08.160> in<00:04:08.430> the

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
must be rotated so that a slot in the

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.180 
must be rotated so that a slot in the
side<00:04:08.850> of<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.090> pin<00:04:09.330> field<00:04:09.720> of<00:04:10.110> each<00:04:10.290> pin<00:04:10.620> aligns

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
side of the pin field of each pin aligns

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.890 
side of the pin field of each pin aligns
with<00:04:11.940> a<00:04:12.560> finger<00:04:13.560> in<00:04:13.800> the<00:04:14.040> side<00:04:14.310> bar<00:04:14.900> allowing

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
with a finger in the side bar allowing

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.830 
with a finger in the side bar allowing
the<00:04:16.470> side<00:04:16.739> bar<00:04:17.010> to<00:04:17.040> drop<00:04:17.579> into<00:04:18.239> the<00:04:18.389> recesses

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
the side bar to drop into the recesses

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:25.460 
the side bar to drop into the recesses
in<00:04:19.169> the<00:04:19.380> sides<00:04:19.650> of<00:04:19.859> the<00:04:19.919> pins<00:04:23.090> making<00:04:24.090> it<00:04:24.470> quite

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
in the sides of the pins making it quite

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.920 
in the sides of the pins making it quite
difficult<00:04:25.650> to<00:04:26.130> pick<00:04:28.130> all<00:04:29.130> right

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
difficult to pick all right

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.950 
difficult to pick all right
so<00:04:30.930> now<00:04:31.110> oh<00:04:31.580> one<00:04:32.580> of<00:04:32.610> the<00:04:32.820> other<00:04:32.850> mistakes<00:04:33.750> I

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
so now oh one of the other mistakes I

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.950 
so now oh one of the other mistakes I
made<00:04:34.230> when<00:04:34.950> I<00:04:34.980> did<00:04:35.520> my<00:04:35.669> last<00:04:35.750> review<00:04:36.750> of<00:04:36.840> this

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
made when I did my last review of this

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.520 
made when I did my last review of this
lock<00:04:37.200> was<00:04:37.650> to<00:04:38.280> say<00:04:38.550> that<00:04:38.880> there<00:04:39.870> were<00:04:40.020> four

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
lock was to say that there were four

made<00:04:46.110> a<00:04:46.140> bit<00:04:46.320> of<00:04:46.410> a<00:04:46.440> mistake<00:04:46.710> there<00:04:47.160> that<00:04:47.490> was

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
made a bit of a mistake there that was

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.570 
made a bit of a mistake there that was
one<00:04:48.330> of<00:04:48.450> the<00:04:48.540> newer<00:04:49.460> Sargent<00:04:50.460> and<00:04:50.520> Greenleaf

prevent submersion in liquid nitrogen
and<00:05:12.060> shattering<00:05:12.630> of<00:05:12.870> the<00:05:12.990> lock<00:05:13.490> like<00:05:14.490> as<00:05:14.700> in<00:05:14.910> a

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
and shattering of the lock like as in a

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.580 
and shattering of the lock like as in a
regular<00:05:15.150> brass<00:05:15.930> padlock

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
regular brass padlock

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.710 
regular brass padlock
if<00:05:16.830> you<00:05:16.950> submerged<00:05:17.460> it<00:05:17.729> in<00:05:17.940> liquid<00:05:18.210> nitrogen

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
if you submerged it in liquid nitrogen

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.590 
if you submerged it in liquid nitrogen
for<00:05:19.620> 20<00:05:20.039> minutes<00:05:20.340> and<00:05:20.550> then<00:05:20.669> pulled<00:05:21.390> it<00:05:21.510> out

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
for 20 minutes and then pulled it out

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.270 
for 20 minutes and then pulled it out
and<00:05:21.780> hit<00:05:21.990> it<00:05:22.080> with<00:05:22.169> a<00:05:22.200> hammer<00:05:22.410> it<00:05:22.800> would<00:05:22.950> smash

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
and hit it with a hammer it would smash

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.650 
and hit it with a hammer it would smash
it<00:05:23.520> to<00:05:23.669> thousands<00:05:24.210> of<00:05:24.300> tiny<00:05:24.570> little<00:05:24.810> pieces

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
it to thousands of tiny little pieces

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.750 
it to thousands of tiny little pieces
okay<00:05:27.890> so<00:05:28.890> now<00:05:29.070> we're<00:05:29.220> gonna<00:05:29.310> go<00:05:29.520> for

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
okay so now we're gonna go for

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.990 
okay so now we're gonna go for
reassembly<00:05:31.190> it's<00:05:32.190> pretty<00:05:32.460> simple<00:05:32.820> once

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
reassembly it's pretty simple once

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.330 
reassembly it's pretty simple once
you've<00:05:33.180> done<00:05:33.300> it<00:05:33.360> a<00:05:33.479> couple<00:05:33.510> of<00:05:33.720> times

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
you've done it a couple of times

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:59.240 
you've done it a couple of times
a<00:05:35.400> monkey<00:05:36.240> could<00:05:36.419> do<00:05:36.570> it<00:05:57.350> and<00:05:58.350> now<00:05:58.590> that's<00:05:59.070> all

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
a monkey could do it and now that's all

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:04.390 
a monkey could do it and now that's all
