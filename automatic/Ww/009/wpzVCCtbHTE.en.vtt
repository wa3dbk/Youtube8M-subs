00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.070
 I am here on the beach in Florida 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.810
 I promised a handstand 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.370
 tutorial video 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.310
 That's why I'm doing the video here now 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.480
 and I pay by first a few 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.710
 to warm up exercises because you want 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.540
 shooter not too hard in the cold state 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.740
 stimulate 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.420
 if you do that once 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.850
 but not on time if you really 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.890
 good volt can stand and more 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.070
 Exercises and always have to 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.770
 the shoulder was so easy to do 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.850
 to create normal you can also 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.870
 a name made 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.870
 well, you are in front 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:00.570
 we arrive with a very simple one 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.180
 exercise and that's how you feel 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.120
 get as it is at all on the 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.630
 That's why we take 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:12.540
 now the knee is at the poor run 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.280
 It's just so easy 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.950
 that roche win and have to 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.520
 brace imitate her feeling 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.620
 gets and actually quite easy, the 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.740
 Anyone of you can and so take a look 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.740
 here 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.989
 because 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:47.480
 As I said the elbows are never 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.230
 take something and just after 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.060
 tilt forward 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.310
 and so you get that first 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.010
 first feeling like it is on the phones 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.680
 and now the same again 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.230
 complete stand directly from the frog 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.340
 position to the decency that you can 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.340
 then practice next 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:19.440
 look for it so first in frog decency in 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.420
 the normal handstand and if it is then 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.640
 really works as long as visit 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.890
 possible to stay up and it is 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.220
 really so in the beginning you have to think 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.320
 really complete the arm 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.600
 use possible on the hands too 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.440
 but stay that way it is not 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.000
 At some point you will get a better one 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.740
 balance 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.350
 then you can really only with the 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:43.380
 finger this back and forth 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:47.070
 to balance with just the practical 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.570
 power the fingers then so stupid because 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.150
 you already because you already really 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:54.240
 progress and can really do better 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.720
 so then on the hands are here 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.720
 once again 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:27.660
 as a stand featuring next Agreement the 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:30.810
 next time for a week now 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:33.990
 or so and contex felt and then 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.360
 It shows the landscape and as 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.640
 Next is also the flash exercise 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.640
