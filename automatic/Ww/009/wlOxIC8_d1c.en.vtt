 it is necessary to go a long way of almost three hours until arriving at the salinas 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:11.959
 great fukui 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:13.530
 even though it's a long stretch 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.120
 the time passes almost without being perceived result of the beauty of the place the 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.790
 colorful mountains beyond the countless homes the cactus grove the stop 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.580
 compulsory from there the climb gets more intense 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.870
 the cold also increases every kilometer until reaching almost 4 thousand and 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.810
 200 meters of altitude 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.310
 This is the highest point of the trip here, we are four thousand and seven hundred 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.879
 height 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.879
 you can feel a little difficult even to breathe and to 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.020
 also falls quite significantly at night when you can 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:49.059
 get to minus 20 degrees exactly at this point is full of part of the breast 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:50.840
 or high of the mother earth 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.579
 here was a must stop for travelers from the pre-colonial period 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.719
 in the time when the land dominated by the Incas here begins the descent until arriving 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.190
 to salinas at three thousand and 200 meters of altitude 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.510
 the blog the beginning of the work never appears and as the landscape approaches 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.730
 is transforming are more than 12 thousand hectares of pure salt 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.320
 this all a million years ago was part of the Pacific Ocean still today 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.930
 when you dig more than 40 centimeters the water gushes from the ground to hitachi that 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.480
 explain that salt is used for three things human consumption treatment 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.830
 animals for pharmaceutical purposes and we will have the quota or companies 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.070
 It happened 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.060
 that's the sector 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.900
 is extracted from it in three different ways 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.380
 for wages or domestic past over territory and to get out of suffocation 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.520
 but centric the whole process of salt extraction is done manually 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.789
 workers do not have access to any kind of machinery 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:52.980
 only used tools or dried as picks and peace 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.909
 workers earn an average of 40 people per ton of salt 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.049
 the equivalent of 22 reais for this requires at least two days of work 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:03.010
 intense

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.140
 to supplement income 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.040
 many produce handicrafts with blocks of salt 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.819
 now the salineiros

 is that it recalls that its economy 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:17.389
 with 90 warning this alliance 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:21.269
 is this that if necessary mpe should delay to run 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.370
 they found little to aneel mÃ¡rio soares to customers 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.599
 strachan
