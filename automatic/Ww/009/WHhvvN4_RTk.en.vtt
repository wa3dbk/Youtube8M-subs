00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
potential as the 7v we got assembly they

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.130 
potential as the 7v we got assembly they
really<00:02:13.150> do<00:02:13.330> feel<00:02:13.630> so<00:02:14.050> much<00:02:14.230> a<00:02:14.290> moment

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
really do feel so much a moment

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.430 
really do feel so much a moment
sandy<00:02:17.140> is<00:02:17.220> fantastic

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.440 

when<00:02:22.070> you<00:02:22.190> shoot<00:02:22.400> both<00:02:22.700> cameras<00:02:23.120> you<00:02:23.240> most

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
when you shoot both cameras you most

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.000 
when you shoot both cameras you most
likely<00:02:23.690> won't<00:02:23.930> feel<00:02:24.200> much<00:02:24.380> of<00:02:24.500> a<00:02:24.560> difference

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
likely won't feel much of a difference

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.210 
likely won't feel much of a difference
in<00:02:25.190> use<00:02:25.430> so<00:02:26.060> what<00:02:26.210> sets<00:02:26.540> 270<00:02:27.080> of<00:02:27.200> home<00:02:27.440> or<00:02:27.830> is<00:02:28.070> it

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
an outdated irrelevant DSLR unite

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.760 
an outdated irrelevant DSLR unite
assembly<00:02:31.580> has<00:02:31.760> some<00:02:32.270> benefits<00:02:32.930> I<00:02:33.140> mean<00:02:33.320> it's<00:02:33.560> a

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
assembly has some benefits I mean it's a

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.100 
assembly has some benefits I mean it's a
tougher<00:02:34.160> body<00:02:34.400> is<00:02:34.670> going<00:02:34.850> will<00:02:35.300> magnesium

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
tougher body is going will magnesium

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.960 
tougher body is going will magnesium
alloy<00:02:36.560> compared<00:02:37.010> to<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.310> plastic<00:02:37.580> and

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
alloy compared to the plastic and

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.930 
alloy compared to the plastic and
plastic<00:02:38.240> 70d<00:02:39.140> so<00:02:39.890> this<00:02:40.040> should<00:02:40.190> be<00:02:40.250> tougher<00:02:40.490> if

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
plastic 70d so this should be tougher if

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.350 
plastic 70d so this should be tougher if
I<00:02:41.300> should<00:02:41.930> get<00:02:42.050> hit<00:02:42.230> or<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:42.380> camera<00:02:42.710> gets<00:02:42.920> hit

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
I should get hit or the camera gets hit

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.480 
I should get hit or the camera gets hit
