deal

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
deal

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.870 
deal
because<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.720> am<00:01:31.110> not<00:01:31.470> good<00:01:31.890> at<00:01:32.250> this<00:01:32.490> kind<00:01:32.670> of

because I am not good at this kind of
stuff<00:01:33.090> at<00:01:33.210> all<00:01:33.299> but<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.470> watched<00:01:34.799> several

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
stuff at all but I watched several

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.980 
stuff at all but I watched several
different<00:01:35.490> videos<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:36.119> took<00:01:36.180> what<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.659> liked

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
different videos and I took what I liked

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.390 
different videos and I took what I liked
from<00:01:37.140> each<00:01:37.350> one<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.680> them<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:37.979> lot<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.159> times

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
from each one of them so a lot of times

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.280 
from each one of them so a lot of times
when<00:01:38.520> people<00:01:38.729> do<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.939> halters<00:01:39.329> they<00:01:39.960> actually

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
when people do the halters they actually

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.160 
when people do the halters they actually
cut<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.619> in<00:01:40.740> really<00:01:40.920> narrow<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.840> didn't

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
cut it in really narrow and I didn't

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.499 
cut it in really narrow and I didn't
really<00:01:43.710> like<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.159> cut<00:01:44.640> because<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.210> doesn't

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
really like that cut because it doesn't

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.990 
really like that cut because it doesn't
give<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.810> lot<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.170> leeway<00:01:46.380> if<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.790> make

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
give you a lot of leeway if you make

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
only reason I'm doing that is I know I

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.789 
only reason I'm doing that is I know I

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
then I'm cutting it here because this is

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.600 
then I'm cutting it here because this is
where<00:02:09.270> I'm<00:02:09.390> going<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.569> used<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:09.989> to<00:02:10.349> tie<00:02:10.709> around

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
where I'm going to used it to tie around

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
where I'm going to used it to tie around

and I'm just going to make it a little

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.360 
and I'm just going to make it a little
bit<00:02:14.790> an<00:02:14.940> hour<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:16.170> I<00:02:16.530> hope<00:02:16.800> I'm<00:02:16.980> not<00:02:17.010> going<00:02:17.310> to

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370

really really really sharp scissors and

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.280 
really really really sharp scissors and
I<00:02:22.050> tend<00:02:22.380> to<00:02:22.700> be<00:02:23.700> pretty<00:02:24.090> bad<00:02:24.390> with<00:02:24.810> sharp

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290

bernalillo<00:02:29.760> like<00:02:30.210> that<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.660> then<00:02:30.960> I'm<00:02:31.200> going

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
bernalillo like that and then I'm going

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.230 
bernalillo like that and then I'm going
to<00:02:31.380> cut<00:02:31.620> off<00:02:31.710> the<00:02:31.860> end<00:02:32.010> I'm<00:02:32.640> going<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.850> end<00:02:33.030> up

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240

using the sleeves before some bows then
I'm<00:02:39.360> going<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.570> put<00:02:39.900> on<00:02:40.620> I'm<00:02:41.520> going<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.090> tie<00:02:42.360> on

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
I'm going to put on I'm going to tie on

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.430 
I'm going to put on I'm going to tie on
this<00:02:44.070> now<00:02:44.400> I<00:02:44.430> know<00:02:44.610> this<00:02:44.940> shirts<00:02:45.210> really<00:02:46.170> long

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
this now I know this shirts really long

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.350 
this now I know this shirts really long
and<00:02:46.890> large<00:02:47.370> so<00:02:47.670> I'm<00:02:47.760> not<00:02:47.850> going<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.180> worry

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
and large so I'm not going to worry

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.120 
and large so I'm not going to worry
about<00:02:48.510> cutting<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.110> bottom<00:02:49.440> correctly<00:02:49.920> but<00:02:50.100> I

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
about cutting the bottom correctly but I

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.900 
about cutting the bottom correctly but I
am<00:02:50.280> cutting<00:02:50.640> it<00:02:50.730> near<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.510> seam<00:02:52.610> and<00:02:53.610> it

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
am cutting it near the seam and it

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.160 
am cutting it near the seam and it
doesn't<00:02:54.180> have<00:02:54.300> to<00:02:54.390> be<00:02:54.480> perfect<00:02:54.900> because<00:02:54.960> the

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
doesn't have to be perfect because the

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.000 
doesn't have to be perfect because the
bottom<00:02:55.470> tends<00:02:55.710> to<00:02:56.190> kind<00:02:56.640> of<00:02:57.230> roll<00:02:58.230> up<00:02:58.470> anyway

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
bottom tends to kind of roll up anyway

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.470 
bottom tends to kind of roll up anyway
and<00:02:59.370> if<00:02:59.490> you<00:02:59.580> don't<00:02:59.730> like<00:02:59.880> that<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.270> have<00:03:00.390> to

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
and if you don't like that you have to

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.510 
and if you don't like that you have to
figure<00:03:00.870> something<00:03:01.110> out<00:03:01.380> and<00:03:01.590> then<00:03:02.250> I<00:03:02.280> just

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
figure something out and then I just

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.600 
figure something out and then I just
kind<00:03:02.850> of<00:03:02.910> stretch<00:03:03.300> it<00:03:03.620> so<00:03:04.620> that<00:03:04.860> it<00:03:05.010> has<00:03:05.280> a<00:03:05.310> nice

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
kind of stretch it so that it has a nice

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.570 
kind of stretch it so that it has a nice
relaxed<00:03:06.360> fit<00:03:06.720> now<00:03:07.410> what<00:03:07.590> I<00:03:07.620> did<00:03:07.890> learn<00:03:08.190> from<00:03:08.460> my

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
relaxed fit now what I did learn from my

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.130 
relaxed fit now what I did learn from my
last<00:03:08.850> cutting<00:03:09.390> job<00:03:09.660> is<00:03:10.020> that<00:03:11.630> I'm<00:03:12.630> trying<00:03:12.930> to

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
Center my 1 billion rising so it's kind

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.810 
Center my 1 billion rising so it's kind
of<00:03:15.810> even<00:03:16.170> and<00:03:16.890> when<00:03:17.010> I<00:03:17.130> cut<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.580> middle

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
of even and when I cut the middle

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.490 
of even and when I cut the middle
because<00:03:18.000> I'm<00:03:18.150> going<00:03:18.270> to<00:03:18.330> tie<00:03:18.630> all<00:03:19.020> this<00:03:19.230> up

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500

back so I'm going to tie this up the

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.980 
back so I'm going to tie this up the
back<00:03:22.110> move<00:03:22.770> I<00:03:22.890> left<00:03:23.070> some<00:03:23.250> seam<00:03:23.520> on<00:03:23.730> here<00:03:23.990> take

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
back move I left some seam on here take

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.130 
back move I left some seam on here take
care<00:03:25.230> of<00:03:25.320> that<00:03:25.440> in<00:03:25.620> a<00:03:25.770> little<00:03:25.800> bit<00:03:27.020> she<00:03:28.020> like

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.340 
have to cut twice it doesn't have to be
perfect<00:03:41.580> okay<00:03:41.880> I'm<00:03:42.840> going<00:03:42.930> to<00:03:42.990> go<00:03:43.170> a<00:03:43.200> little

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
perfect okay I'm going to go a little

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.340 
perfect okay I'm going to go a little
bit<00:03:43.560> longer<00:03:43.940> this<00:03:44.940> time<00:03:45.000> I<00:03:45.540> went<00:03:45.870> a<00:03:45.990> little<00:03:46.020> bit

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
bit longer this time I went a little bit

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.950 
bit longer this time I went a little bit
shorter<00:03:47.120> last<00:03:48.120> time<00:03:48.530> this<00:03:49.530> is<00:03:49.590> a<00:03:49.740> bigger<00:03:50.190> shirt

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:50.960 
shorter last time this is a bigger shirt

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.080 
shorter last time this is a bigger shirt
so<00:03:51.960> I'm<00:03:52.230> going<00:03:52.380> to<00:03:52.470> see<00:03:52.680> how<00:03:52.950> this<00:03:53.370> works<00:03:53.790> out

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
so I'm going to see how this works out

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.330 
so I'm going to see how this works out
these<00:03:55.050> are<00:03:55.140> going<00:03:55.230> to<00:03:55.320> end<00:03:55.470> up<00:03:55.590> being<00:03:55.800> my<00:03:55.980> ties

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
these are going to end up being my ties

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.240 
these are going to end up being my ties
and<00:03:56.910> I<00:03:57.240> even<00:03:57.420> looking<00:03:57.930> at<00:03:58.050> it<00:03:58.110> right<00:03:58.260> now<00:03:58.320> I'm

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
and I even looking at it right now I'm

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.000 
and I even looking at it right now I'm
thinking<00:03:59.580> they're<00:03:59.730> probably<00:03:59.970> still<00:04:00.630> a<00:04:01.080> little

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
thinking they're probably still a little

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.250 
thinking they're probably still a little
bit<00:04:02.340> I<00:04:03.140> cut<00:04:04.140> this<00:04:04.260> a<00:04:04.320> little<00:04:04.560> shorter<00:04:05.010> here

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
bit I cut this a little shorter here

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.670 
bit I cut this a little shorter here
give<00:04:07.260> it<00:04:07.290> a<00:04:07.380> little<00:04:07.730> fatness<00:04:08.730> to<00:04:08.940> it<00:04:09.350> so<00:04:10.350> maybe

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
give it a little fatness to it so maybe

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.290 
give it a little fatness to it so maybe
we'll<00:04:10.920> even<00:04:11.070> some<00:04:11.400> of<00:04:11.490> these<00:04:11.580> out<00:04:11.790> a<00:04:12.030> little

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.460 
we'll even some of these out a little
bit<00:04:12.480> even<00:04:13.410> it<00:04:13.620> out<00:04:13.710> even<00:04:14.220> it<00:04:14.340> out

because<00:04:42.140> then<00:04:42.260> you'll<00:04:42.380> work<00:04:42.500> them<00:04:42.620> off<00:04:42.740> but<00:04:43.160> if

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
because then you'll work them off but if

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.290 
because then you'll work them off but if
you<00:04:43.520> rip<00:04:43.640> them<00:04:43.760> off<00:04:43.850> it<00:04:44.000> doesn't<00:04:44.150> really

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
you rip them off it doesn't really

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.690 
you rip them off it doesn't really
matter<00:04:44.510> you<00:04:44.810> can<00:04:45.530> just<00:04:45.680> tie<00:04:45.950> three<00:04:46.400> together

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
matter you can just tie three together

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.890 
matter you can just tie three together
what<00:04:47.180> you<00:04:47.210> do<00:04:47.510> it's<00:04:48.380> not<00:04:48.650> a<00:04:48.860> big<00:04:49.070> deal<00:04:49.370> and<00:04:49.900> so

my neck and what I didn't show in my
last<00:04:57.980> video<00:04:58.430> is<00:04:58.730> that<00:04:59.090> I<00:04:59.360> took<00:04:59.710> the<00:05:00.710> sleeve<00:05:03.310> and

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310

I went ahead and cut the edge of the
sleeve<00:05:06.860> off<00:05:07.419> just<00:05:08.419> move<00:05:08.600> that<00:05:08.810> black<00:05:08.990> on<00:05:09.200> black

then<00:05:21.230> I<00:05:21.320> cut<00:05:21.650> them<00:05:22.960> so<00:05:23.960> they're<00:05:24.260> separate<00:05:24.770> I

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
then I cut them so they're separate I

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.640 
then I cut them so they're separate I
don't<00:05:25.640> really<00:05:25.790> care<00:05:26.060> if<00:05:26.810> the<00:05:27.020> seams<00:05:27.290> in<00:05:27.470> there

don't really care if the seams in there

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.940 
don't really care if the seams in there
or<00:05:27.830> not<00:05:28.040> you<00:05:28.280> can<00:05:28.430> cut<00:05:28.580> that<00:05:28.730> off<00:05:28.790> if<00:05:29.150> you<00:05:29.270> want

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
or not you can cut that off if you want

so I'm just going to tuck these them two
toggles<00:05:32.210> and<00:05:32.840> I<00:05:33.229> take<00:05:33.530> them<00:05:33.800> and<00:05:34.010> then<00:05:34.580> I<00:05:34.700> tie

Lobos<00:05:35.450> here<00:05:35.960> in<00:05:36.110> here<00:05:36.560> that<00:05:37.370> way<00:05:37.610> it<00:05:37.880> kind<00:05:38.120> of

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
Lobos here in here that way it kind of

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.940 
Lobos here in here that way it kind of
changes<00:05:38.540> the<00:05:38.570> look<00:05:38.810> of<00:05:38.930> the<00:05:38.990> front<00:05:39.229> so<00:05:39.830> I'm
