this<00:03:05.330> is<00:03:05.510> one<00:03:05.690> of<00:03:05.720> those<00:03:05.870> foundations<00:03:06.440> that

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
this is one of those foundations that

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.830 
this is one of those foundations that
you<00:03:06.739> have<00:03:06.950> to<00:03:07.160> let<00:03:07.310> sit<00:03:07.640> on<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:07.970> skin<00:03:08.239> and<00:03:08.270> set

you have to let sit on the skin and set
from<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:09.470> liquid<00:03:09.890> to<00:03:10.160> powder<00:03:10.190> formulation<00:03:10.879> so

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
from the liquid to powder formulation so

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.000 
from the liquid to powder formulation so
you<00:03:11.660> can<00:03:11.900> go<00:03:12.019> and<00:03:12.050> do<00:03:12.290> other<00:03:12.440> things<00:03:12.530> to<00:03:12.920> your

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
try i think it's called golden honey i

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.280 
try i think it's called golden honey i
want<00:03:44.000> to<00:03:44.090> give<00:03:44.209> that<00:03:44.360> one<00:03:44.540> a<00:03:44.569> try<00:03:44.840> because<00:03:44.989> this

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
want to give that one a try because this

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.949 
want to give that one a try because this
one<00:03:45.470> i<00:03:45.500> just<00:03:45.560> i<00:03:45.920> eyeballed<00:03:46.670> it<00:03:46.849> and<00:03:47.090> basically

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
one i just i eyeballed it and basically

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.140 
one i just i eyeballed it and basically
said<00:03:48.440> you<00:03:48.620> know<00:03:48.650> i'll<00:03:49.250> give<00:03:49.430> this<00:03:49.519> a<00:03:49.579> try<00:03:49.790> it

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
said you know i'll give this a try it

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.740 
said you know i'll give this a try it
blends<00:03:50.540> flawlessly<00:03:51.440> um<00:03:52.209> again<00:03:53.209> I'd<00:03:53.390> say<00:03:53.569> it's

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
blends flawlessly um again I'd say it's

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.780 
blends flawlessly um again I'd say it's
best<00:03:54.019> to<00:03:54.290> use<00:03:54.319> a<00:03:54.440> sponge<00:03:54.860> or<00:03:55.160> beauty<00:03:55.459> blender

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
best to use a sponge or beauty blender

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.370 
best to use a sponge or beauty blender
because<00:03:55.940> then<00:03:56.450> you<00:03:56.569> can<00:03:56.690> just<00:03:56.840> bounce<00:03:57.019> it<00:03:57.290> off

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
because then you can just bounce it off

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.530 
because then you can just bounce it off
of<00:03:57.620> the<00:03:57.680> face<00:03:57.890> and<00:03:58.160> it<00:03:58.819> does<00:03:59.000> a<00:03:59.030> great<00:03:59.239> job<00:03:59.360> with

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
of the face and it does a great job with

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.690 
of the face and it does a great job with
coverage<00:04:00.079> if<00:04:00.230> you've<00:04:00.380> got<00:04:00.620> dark<00:04:01.010> circles<00:04:01.340> and

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
coverage if you've got dark circles and

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.370 
coverage if you've got dark circles and
you're<00:04:01.880> going<00:04:02.000> to<00:04:02.090> want<00:04:02.209> to<00:04:02.299> go<00:04:02.329> in<00:04:02.630> I'd<00:04:02.959> say

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
you're going to want to go in I'd say

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.470 
you're going to want to go in I'd say
with<00:04:03.620> a<00:04:03.650> concealer<00:04:04.400> just<00:04:04.940> a<00:04:05.000> little<00:04:05.150> bit<00:04:05.299> cuz

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
with a concealer just a little bit cuz

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.509 
with a concealer just a little bit cuz
as<00:04:05.599> you<00:04:05.720> can<00:04:05.900> see<00:04:06.049> my<00:04:06.200> real<00:04:06.560> problem<00:04:06.860> area<00:04:07.340> it

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
as you can see my real problem area it

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.030 
as you can see my real problem area it
did<00:04:07.790> you<00:04:08.120> know<00:04:08.239> cover<00:04:08.720> it<00:04:08.930> a<00:04:08.989> little<00:04:09.170> bit<00:04:09.410> but

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
did you know cover it a little bit but

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.340 
did you know cover it a little bit but
it<00:04:10.280> just<00:04:10.790> you<00:04:11.690> can<00:04:11.810> still<00:04:11.989> see<00:04:12.139> it<00:04:12.170> peeking

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
it just you can still see it peeking

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.160 
it just you can still see it peeking
through<00:04:12.620> just<00:04:12.799> a<00:04:12.859> smidgen<00:04:13.250> so<00:04:13.700> yeah<00:04:14.510> this<00:04:14.870> is

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
through just a smidgen so yeah this is

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.039 
through just a smidgen so yeah this is
buildable<00:04:15.829> I<00:04:16.250> take<00:04:17.150> medium<00:04:17.450> to<00:04:17.600> build<00:04:17.810> both

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
buildable I take medium to build both

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.500 
buildable I take medium to build both
full<00:04:18.289> coverage<00:04:18.709> so<00:04:19.010> if<00:04:19.160> you<00:04:19.370> basically<00:04:20.150> do<00:04:20.359> it

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
full coverage so if you basically do it

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.060 
full coverage so if you basically do it
in<00:04:20.600> layers<00:04:20.840> then<00:04:21.380> you're<00:04:21.530> going<00:04:21.620> to<00:04:21.680> get<00:04:21.889> a

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
in layers then you're going to get a

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.500 
in layers then you're going to get a
little<00:04:22.190> bit<00:04:22.370> more<00:04:22.490> coverage<00:04:22.700> with<00:04:23.030> it<00:04:23.210> but<00:04:23.389> if

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
little bit more coverage with it but if

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:24.730 
little bit more coverage with it but if
you've<00:04:23.630> got<00:04:23.810> dark<00:04:24.050> circles<00:04:24.260> are<00:04:24.560> really

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
you've got dark circles are really

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.320 
you've got dark circles are really
really<00:04:24.889> dark<00:04:25.070> scarring<00:04:25.550> it's<00:04:25.910> going<00:04:26.090> to<00:04:26.120> cover

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
really dark scarring it's going to cover

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.820 
really dark scarring it's going to cover
it<00:04:26.510> but<00:04:26.630> if<00:04:26.720> you<00:04:26.840> want<00:04:27.020> it<00:04:27.110> completely<00:04:27.650> gone
