00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:46.610
 in short, you need to unscrew these two bolts once 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.240
 two gadget that is 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:57.140

00:00:50.240 --> 00:01:00.010
 I will also unscrew it from above 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.010
 key needed 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.159
 The key is needed at 8 and 17 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:17.790
 here we unscrew the handle I already have it 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.790
 in short, weakened everything 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.220

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.650
 and everyone here unscrewed 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:46.180
 we are now below 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:57.540

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:57.540
 take out to this shaybochka interferes rusted 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.740
 we have 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.689
 here it is, but 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:32.640
 water you are not dry 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:32.640
 this dry then could not 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.290
 and unscrewed remove 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.950
 during sleep 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.640
 but 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.340
 T-shirt substance 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.700
 but 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.700
 Oh 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:07.540
 this bitch will work for sax too 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.540
 something wet is working 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.170
 Loco 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.850
 format 1 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:30.440
 when wet 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.440
 1 wet digits ok 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:40.940
 so now we are removing fastenings from here 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.940
 here to rearrange the shock absorbers 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:51.660
 there is still such still there is such nuance 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:54.920
 Here you do not hold this god at first 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:59.730
 first thrust 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:06.560
 Well, with one hand understood the end somewhere 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:12.060
 here so here now all he gets up and about 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:15.360
 it turns out that's a little bit have 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:19.050
 chilled here you know already 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:23.390
 and clamp in that position and then 

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:23.390
 leave back and and that's it 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:33.190
 I also want to say that 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:40.240
 gas must be pumped before installation 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:44.610
 and put them and when you pump already 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:49.860
 don't flip bleed three times there 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:56.590
 here thrust thrust stuck all 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:05:00.130
 will work now I fasten more 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:03.090
 One tip is to always have your bolts. 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.300
 unscrewed free you did not suffer 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.259
 smear 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:14.380
 not krolike unhealthy blurted out 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:23.580
 everything will always be normal 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:23.580
 able to all one I put everyone will say 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.580
 so 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.580
 I spun everything 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:38.300
 everything is twisted there there is such 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:45.729
 principle can shoot anything 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:45.729
 someone will be interested in all the luck for now
