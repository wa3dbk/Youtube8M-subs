00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 hello people i show you today like you 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:09.660
 follow your bike brakes yourself 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.900
 You should always be able to do it if you are 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:17.210
 eg the press here too far 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.680
 I have to grab the brakes properly 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.710
 Now I'll show you how to do it completely 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.720
 light itself makes so now we are at the 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.449
 rear part of the bike because me 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.029
 Now first the rear brake to 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.329
 want to pull 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:38.480
 what you need is a nimbus 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:41.489
 depending on how big you are 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.879
 this screw what you need for it 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.710
 this mother depending on how tall 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.190
 the hole is you have to hold others 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.920
 I have to take it to 1 5 it should think 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.480
 I have to be with most riders so 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:59.809
 so and then the only thing you do 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.809
 he must take the muscle and 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.190
 relaxes the first time 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.299
 yes, that's a bit 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.970
 tricky and must hit good and so 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.780
 now we have already relaxed 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:19.939
 Here you see that is the brake cable 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.909
 and if you brake properly 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:25.580
 tighten gold to make it harder again 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.270
 I have to do a little more 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:32.270
 loosen that would have to be so good 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:35.090
 so then you have the choice 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:39.289
 pull this cable through here 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.979
 So the way to move here 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:44.929
 shorter and it is up at the brake 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.369
 just not that just not so far 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:48.770
 must press when braking 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:52.399
 thanks to her a much stronger brake so 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.369
 only now pulled here and afterwards 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.929
 it would have to be solid again 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.229
 clamp this cable back in the same way as it does 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:59.229
 was before 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:09.789
 sorry if it's a bit 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:09.789
 wobbles so that's it again 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:16.010
 yes and that's it 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.540
 You just have to do the same if you have the same 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.290
 front brake has also make 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.660
 so it's exactly see I'll show you 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.300
 now fast as it is then forward 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.720
 The brake looks again here 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:33.170
 Now you can eat the nut too much 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:36.880
 less impress that the brake 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:40.720
 that's right , so it's really stable 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:45.110
 and then you have good braking power again 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:47.030
 for a safer drive yes I hope 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.610
 you liked the video and it 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:53.330
 has also brought something with that you then 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.050
 You can do it yourself thanks 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.010
 for watching 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.010
 bye
