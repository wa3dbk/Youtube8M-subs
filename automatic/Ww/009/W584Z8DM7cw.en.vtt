anyway<00:02:58.660> so<00:02:59.660> basically<00:03:00.170> there's<00:03:00.440> a<00:03:00.530> little

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
anyway so basically there's a little

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.340 
anyway so basically there's a little
tablet<00:03:02.000> back<00:03:02.150> where<00:03:02.450> you<00:03:02.540> plug<00:03:02.660> it<00:03:02.810> into<00:03:02.930> that

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
tablet back where you plug it into that

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.800 
tablet back where you plug it into that
one<00:03:03.500> normally<00:03:03.830> and<00:03:04.239> basically<00:03:05.239> just<00:03:05.510> plug

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
one normally and basically just plug

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.780 
one normally and basically just plug
that<00:03:05.840> into<00:03:06.140> the<00:03:06.530> port<00:03:06.800> in<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:07.010> back<00:03:07.100> it's<00:03:07.550> very

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
that into the port in the back it's very

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.400 
that into the port in the back it's very
tie<00:03:08.030> though<00:03:08.269> so<00:03:08.510> I<00:03:08.570> probably<00:03:08.780> recommend<00:03:09.230> doing

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
tie though so I probably recommend doing

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.110 
tie though so I probably recommend doing
it<00:03:09.620> too<00:03:09.769> often<00:03:09.950> so<00:03:10.310> if<00:03:10.400> you're<00:03:10.550> doing<00:03:10.730> it<00:03:10.820> play

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
it too often so if you're doing it play

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.660 
it too often so if you're doing it play
value<00:03:11.380> will<00:03:12.380> eventually<00:03:12.860> start<00:03:13.130> wearing<00:03:13.580> away

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
value will eventually start wearing away

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.930 
value will eventually start wearing away
and<00:03:13.910> probably<00:03:14.000> break<00:03:14.590> but<00:03:15.590> pretty<00:03:16.580> much<00:03:16.670> is

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
and probably break but pretty much is

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.199 
and probably break but pretty much is
now<00:03:17.590> so<00:03:18.590> yeah<00:03:19.040> figure<00:03:19.550> itself<00:03:19.790> like<00:03:19.970> I<00:03:20.000> said

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
now so yeah figure itself like I said

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.000 
now so yeah figure itself like I said
there's<00:03:20.360> nice<00:03:20.570> chunky<00:03:21.170> one<00:03:21.320> I<00:03:21.560> think<00:03:21.950> that

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
there's nice chunky one I think that

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.470 
there's nice chunky one I think that
really<00:03:22.100> sides<00:03:22.610> looking<00:03:23.030> on<00:03:23.209> the<00:03:23.330> figure

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
really sides looking on the figure

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.059 
really sides looking on the figure
itself

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.130 

back<00:03:26.760> in<00:03:26.939> on<00:03:27.060> this<00:03:27.180> face<00:03:27.390> again<00:03:27.719> because<00:03:27.989> i

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
back in on this face again because i

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.809 
back in on this face again because i
think<00:03:28.260> his<00:03:28.469> face<00:03:28.709> I<00:03:28.980> think<00:03:29.280> they<00:03:29.370> finally<00:03:29.579> got

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
think his face I think they finally got

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.239 
think his face I think they finally got
the<00:03:29.939> face<00:03:30.120> spot<00:03:30.510> on<00:03:30.629> you<00:03:31.590> can<00:03:31.709> see<00:03:31.859> past<00:03:32.069> it

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:32.249 
the face spot on you can see past it

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:38.300 
the face spot on you can see past it
this<00:03:32.670> big<00:03:32.909> boob<00:03:36.290> the<00:03:37.290> eyes<00:03:37.469> are<00:03:37.499> a<00:03:37.739> bit<00:03:37.769> blue

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
this big boob the eyes are a bit blue

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.300 
this big boob the eyes are a bit blue
for<00:03:38.549> me<00:03:38.670> bit<00:03:38.969> too<00:03:39.209> blue<00:03:39.450> but<00:03:39.950> yeah<00:03:40.950> whatever

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
for me bit too blue but yeah whatever

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.429 
for me bit too blue but yeah whatever
but<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:41.790> actual<00:03:42.090> figure<00:03:42.269> itself<00:03:42.510> I'm<00:03:43.260> trying

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:43.439 
but the actual figure itself I'm trying

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:45.920 
but the actual figure itself I'm trying
to<00:03:43.560> bloody<00:03:43.859> zoo<00:03:44.159> myself<00:03:44.519> hey<00:03:44.700> I'm<00:03:45.540> going<00:03:45.780> wrong
