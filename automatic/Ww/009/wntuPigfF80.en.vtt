that's what he's wearing and most of the
the<00:03:57.019> iterations<00:03:57.530> that<00:03:57.709> you<00:03:57.800> see<00:03:58.040> of<00:03:58.160> him<00:03:58.400> now

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
the iterations that you see of him now

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.080 
the iterations that you see of him now
this<00:03:59.570> carbonadium<00:04:00.140> poisoned<00:04:00.950> his<00:04:01.130> body<00:04:01.459> so

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
this carbonadium poisoned his body so

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.460 
this carbonadium poisoned his body so
he's<00:04:02.330> looking<00:04:02.660> for<00:04:02.840> the<00:04:02.930> carbonadium

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
he's looking for the carbonadium

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.340 
he's looking for the carbonadium
synthesizer<00:04:03.760> it's<00:04:04.760> this<00:04:05.239> thing<00:04:05.480> that<00:04:05.510> he<00:04:06.200> has

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
synthesizer it's this thing that he has

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.460 
synthesizer it's this thing that he has
been<00:04:06.560> told<00:04:06.830> that<00:04:07.130> wolverine<00:04:08.050> stole<00:04:09.050> along

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
been told that wolverine stole along

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.740

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
mission together as team X so he really

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.370

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
he's after him because this carbonadium

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.140 
he's after him because this carbonadium
synthesizer<00:04:21.320> will<00:04:22.220> actually<00:04:22.640> make<00:04:22.820> it<00:04:22.850> so<00:04:23.060> he

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
synthesizer will actually make it so he

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.100 
synthesizer will actually make it so he
doesn't<00:04:23.450> have<00:04:23.570> to<00:04:23.630> contain

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
doesn't have to contain

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.899 
doesn't have to contain
new<00:04:24.199> to<00:04:24.349> drain<00:04:24.710> people's<00:04:25.250> bodies<00:04:25.639> that's

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:25.909 
new to drain people's bodies that's

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:27.429 
new to drain people's bodies that's
that's<00:04:26.360> one<00:04:26.599> of<00:04:26.689> the<00:04:26.780> parts<00:04:26.930> that<00:04:27.139> I've<00:04:27.229> left

00:04:27.429 --> 00:04:27.439 
that's one of the parts that I've left

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:29.740 
that's one of the parts that I've left
out<00:04:27.590> so<00:04:27.860> far<00:04:28.039> is<00:04:28.159> that<00:04:28.189> the<00:04:28.909> reason<00:04:29.300> that<00:04:29.449> he

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
out so far is that the reason that he

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.779 
out so far is that the reason that he
has<00:04:30.020> these<00:04:30.469> tentacles<00:04:30.800> and<00:04:31.159> he<00:04:31.250> can<00:04:31.400> wrap<00:04:31.580> them

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:31.789 
has these tentacles and he can wrap them

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:33.490 
has these tentacles and he can wrap them
round<00:04:32.120> people<00:04:32.389> and<00:04:32.719> kind<00:04:32.840> of<00:04:32.990> suck<00:04:33.199> the<00:04:33.379> energy

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
round people and kind of suck the energy

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.879 
round people and kind of suck the energy
out<00:04:33.860> of<00:04:33.889> them<00:04:34.069> is<00:04:34.219> because<00:04:34.969> it<00:04:35.659> it<00:04:36.110> heals<00:04:36.590> him<00:04:36.860> a

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
out of them is because it it heals him a

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:38.649 
out of them is because it it heals him a
little<00:04:37.219> bit<00:04:37.370> it<00:04:37.550> actually<00:04:37.729> keeps<00:04:38.180> him<00:04:38.419> from

00:04:38.649 --> 00:04:38.659 
little bit it actually keeps him from

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:40.659 
little bit it actually keeps him from
being<00:04:38.930> completely<00:04:39.500> poisoned<00:04:40.099> by<00:04:40.189> the<00:04:40.250> metal

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
being completely poisoned by the metal

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.330 
being completely poisoned by the metal
that<00:04:40.849> the<00:04:41.030> the<00:04:41.479> KGB<00:04:42.169> and<00:04:42.319> all<00:04:42.469> these<00:04:42.590> guys<00:04:42.770> have

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
that the the KGB and all these guys have

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.219 
that the the KGB and all these guys have
put<00:04:43.580> in<00:04:43.610> his<00:04:43.819> body<00:04:44.090> once<00:04:44.750> he<00:04:44.870> gets<00:04:45.050> to

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
put in his body once he gets to

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:47.529 
put in his body once he gets to
synthesizer<00:04:45.770> then<00:04:46.430> he<00:04:46.759> will<00:04:46.939> be<00:04:47.090> completely

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:47.539 
synthesizer then he will be completely

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:48.999 
synthesizer then he will be completely
healed<00:04:47.900> and<00:04:48.080> be<00:04:48.169> able<00:04:48.259> to<00:04:48.379> go<00:04:48.560> on<00:04:48.710> with<00:04:48.889> his

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:49.009 
healed and be able to go on with his

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:51.100 
healed and be able to go on with his
life<00:04:49.219> but<00:04:49.490> until<00:04:49.699> then<00:04:50.090> he's<00:04:50.569> kind<00:04:50.900> of<00:04:50.930> like<00:04:51.050> a

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
life but until then he's kind of like a

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.959 
life but until then he's kind of like a
vampire<00:04:51.409> he<00:04:51.800> has<00:04:51.919> to<00:04:52.129> suck<00:04:52.340> the<00:04:52.460> life<00:04:52.639> force

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:52.969 
vampire he has to suck the life force

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:54.490 
vampire he has to suck the life force
out<00:04:53.150> of<00:04:53.300> people<00:04:53.599> just<00:04:53.750> to<00:04:53.870> keep<00:04:53.990> himself<00:04:54.169> alive

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
out of people just to keep himself alive

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.279
