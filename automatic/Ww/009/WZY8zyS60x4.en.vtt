00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:27.870 
little more accurate on their sizing of
course<00:02:27.069> we're<00:02:27.220> going<00:02:27.310> to<00:02:27.370> be<00:02:27.459> eating<00:02:27.489> some<00:02:27.850> of

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
course we're going to be eating some of

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.780 
course we're going to be eating some of
this<00:02:28.030> Apple<00:02:28.329> as<00:02:28.420> well<00:02:32.250> line<00:02:33.250> them<00:02:33.430> up<00:02:33.489> if

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
this Apple as well line them up if

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.509 
this Apple as well line them up if
you're<00:02:33.970> looking<00:02:34.180> for<00:02:34.299> perfection<00:02:34.750> you<00:02:35.139> can

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
you're looking for perfection you can

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.370 
you're looking for perfection you can
take<00:02:36.519> this<00:02:36.700> off<00:02:36.970> and<00:02:37.000> reserve<00:02:37.720> this<00:02:37.959> for<00:02:38.349> a

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
take this off and reserve this for a

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.440 
take this off and reserve this for a
fruit<00:02:38.680> salad<00:02:38.920> and<00:02:39.519> now<00:02:40.030> we're<00:02:40.150> going<00:02:40.239> to<00:02:40.299> be

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
fruit salad and now we're going to be

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.520 
fruit salad and now we're going to be
doing<00:02:40.569> our<00:02:41.069> small<00:02:42.069> dice<00:02:42.430> right<00:02:43.030> here<00:02:43.530> quarter

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
doing our small dice right here quarter

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:52.650 
doing our small dice right here quarter
inch<00:02:44.680> by<00:02:44.950> quarter<00:02:45.220> inch<00:02:50.849> and<00:02:51.849> that's<00:02:52.150> it<00:02:52.450> right

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
inch by quarter inch and that's it right

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.569 
inch by quarter inch and that's it right
there<00:02:52.769> small<00:02:53.769> dice<00:02:54.010> okay<00:02:54.190> now<00:02:54.310> we're<00:02:54.459> moving

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
there small dice okay now we're moving

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:56.490 
there small dice okay now we're moving
on<00:02:54.790> to<00:02:54.819> a<00:02:54.940> medium<00:02:55.090> dice<00:02:55.419> medium<00:02:55.930> dice<00:02:56.079> is<00:02:56.290> 1/2

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
on to a medium dice medium dice is 1/2

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.220 
on to a medium dice medium dice is 1/2
inch<00:02:56.739> by<00:02:56.919> 1/2<00:02:57.099> inch<00:02:57.419> looking<00:02:58.419> for<00:02:58.599> a<00:02:58.630> flat<00:02:58.900> side

first<00:03:00.419> right<00:03:01.419> here

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.690 

most<00:03:09.630> important<00:03:10.080> thing<00:03:10.380> with<00:03:10.830> sizing<00:03:11.400> is<00:03:11.520> that

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
most important thing with sizing is that

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.390 
most important thing with sizing is that
the<00:03:11.820> sizes<00:03:12.030> are<00:03:12.360> consistent<00:03:13.070> so<00:03:14.070> we're<00:03:14.250> going

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
the sizes are consistent so we're going

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:25.150 
the sizes are consistent so we're going
to<00:03:15.230> do<00:03:16.230> these<00:03:19.580> medium<00:03:20.580> dice<00:03:20.790> just<00:03:21.270> like<00:03:21.450> so

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.420 

there<00:03:26.160> you<00:03:26.340> go<00:03:26.460> all<00:03:26.550> medium<00:03:26.910> dice<00:03:28.340> next<00:03:29.340> we

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
there you go all medium dice next we

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.100 
there you go all medium dice next we
have<00:03:29.550> a<00:03:29.580> large<00:03:29.880> dice<00:03:30.150> large<00:03:30.690> dice<00:03:30.930> is

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
have a large dice large dice is

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.940 
have a large dice large dice is
approximately<00:03:31.710> 3/4<00:03:32.580> by<00:03:32.820> 3/4<00:03:33.770> we'll<00:03:34.770> be<00:03:34.830> using

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
approximately 3/4 by 3/4 we'll be using

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.070 
approximately 3/4 by 3/4 we'll be using
this<00:03:35.220> part<00:03:35.550> of<00:03:35.670> the<00:03:35.760> Apple<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:36.810> achieve<00:03:37.050> a

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
this part of the Apple to achieve a

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.050 
this part of the Apple to achieve a
large<00:03:37.350> dice<00:03:37.620> with<00:03:37.980> larger<00:03:38.340> dice<00:03:38.520> we<00:03:38.670> generally

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
large dice with larger dice we generally

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.600 
large dice with larger dice we generally
only<00:03:39.330> make<00:03:39.630> a<00:03:39.660> couple<00:03:39.990> a<00:03:40.320> couple<00:03:40.800> of<00:03:41.370> large

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
only make a couple a couple of large

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.260 
only make a couple a couple of large
dice<00:03:41.910> cuts<00:03:42.830> because<00:03:43.830> it's<00:03:44.730> not<00:03:44.910> used<00:03:45.120> that

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
dice cuts because it's not used that

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:52.340 
dice cuts because it's not used that
often<00:03:50.360> you<00:03:51.360> want<00:03:51.540> them<00:03:51.630> to<00:03:51.720> be<00:03:51.840> square<00:03:52.200> of

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
often you want them to be square of

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.050 
often you want them to be square of
course<00:03:52.590> it's<00:03:52.800> the<00:03:52.830> most<00:03:53.010> important<00:03:53.430> one<00:03:53.610> more

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
course it's the most important one more

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.640 
course it's the most important one more
cut<00:03:54.240> I<00:03:54.270> want<00:03:54.420> to<00:03:54.540> show<00:03:54.720> you<00:03:54.780> is<00:03:55.020> the<00:03:55.170> bat<00:03:55.350> nut

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
cut I want to show you is the bat nut

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:12.610 
cut I want to show you is the bat nut
bat<00:03:56.160> net<00:03:56.400> is<00:03:56.550> 1/4<00:03:57.210> by<00:03:57.360> 1/4

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.289 

this<00:04:13.620> is<00:04:13.769> a<00:04:13.799> bathtub<00:04:14.689> right<00:04:15.689> here

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
this is a bathtub right here

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.460 
this is a bathtub right here
the<00:04:18.299> next<00:04:18.540> cut<00:04:18.720> we're<00:04:18.810> going<00:04:18.930> to<00:04:18.989> be<00:04:19.079> making<00:04:19.290> is

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
the next cut we're going to be making is

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.979 
the next cut we're going to be making is
the<00:04:19.590> French<00:04:19.859> fry<00:04:20.100> cut<00:04:20.449> you<00:04:21.449> need<00:04:21.600> a<00:04:21.660> flat

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
the French fry cut you need a flat

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.040 
the French fry cut you need a flat
surface<00:04:22.019> to<00:04:22.560> begin<00:04:23.010> with<00:04:23.190> french<00:04:23.610> fry<00:04:23.880> is

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
surface to begin with french fry is

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.700 
surface to begin with french fry is
approximately<00:04:25.100> 1/2<00:04:26.100> by<00:04:26.340> 1/2<00:04:26.910> by<00:04:27.240> 3<00:04:27.810> so<00:04:28.590> we're
