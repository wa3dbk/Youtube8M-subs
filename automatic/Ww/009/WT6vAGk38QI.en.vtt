00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:25.060
 mentalist brings what for 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.060

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:54.470
 The German I yesterday with joy hardly 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:59.220
 asleep reading teacher still there 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:01.970

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.450
 really great here 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.640
 correct conclusion 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.740
 my part you see 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.990
 it is students there are not that 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.730
 words I'll just stupid 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.130
 were easy 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.680
 there are student is 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.380
 that was the goal that I drink tea in peace 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.109
 my coffee and then discuss 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.680
 four hours 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.680

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:38.600
 you can see we are not fit here 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:41.970
 the performance courses are still in there 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:45.290
 I'm almost a bit happy 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.290
 But now I have to 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.190
 I think I have that best 

00:04:55.989 --> 00:05:04.209
 So all matched together are like that 

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:04.209
 loud for the abi definitely 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.440
 I got through if not 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.699
 I ran off my can not 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:24.050
 stuck to sand and you can see that 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:26.889
 which full sand kafka in the morning 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.889
