know<00:00:48.960> if<00:00:49.050> you're<00:00:49.170> below<00:00:49.350> 11<00:00:49.860> volts<00:00:50.219> it's<00:00:50.340> red

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
know if you're below 11 volts it's red

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.939 
know if you're below 11 volts it's red
if<00:00:51.180> you're<00:00:51.360> an<00:00:51.449> 11<00:00:51.690> volts<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.230> 12<00:00:52.500> volts<00:00:52.829> if

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
if you're an 11 volts to 12 volts if

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.100 
if you're an 11 volts to 12 volts if
you're<00:00:53.070> 11<00:00:53.699> eight<00:00:53.820> eleven<00:00:54.660> point<00:00:54.870> nine<00:00:54.960> volts

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
you're 11 eight eleven point nine volts

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.220 
you're 11 eight eleven point nine volts
it's<00:00:55.530> orange<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.699> then<00:00:56.820> it's<00:00:57.030> yellow<00:00:57.539> if<00:00:57.870> it's

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
it's orange and then it's yellow if it's

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.830 
it's orange and then it's yellow if it's
twelve<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:59.579> twelve<00:00:59.789> point<00:01:00.090> nine<00:01:00.149> volts<00:01:00.300> that's

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
twelve to twelve point nine volts that's

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.689 
twelve to twelve point nine volts that's
a<00:01:00.930> full<00:01:01.140> charge<00:01:01.410> battery<00:01:01.890> because<00:01:02.129> even<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.430> 12

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
a full charge battery because even a 12

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.539 
a full charge battery because even a 12
and<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.879> half<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:03.329> lighting<00:01:03.719> up<00:01:04.040> so<00:01:05.040> then<00:01:05.250> if<00:01:05.430> I

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
and a half is lighting up so then if I

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:30.060 
and a half is lighting up so then if I
start<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.630> up

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.920 

so<00:01:31.070> you<00:01:31.130> could<00:01:31.370> see<00:01:31.580> that<00:01:31.790> you<00:01:32.090> know<00:01:32.120> it<00:01:32.660> comes

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
so you could see that you know it comes

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.040 
so you could see that you know it comes
on<00:01:33.200> not<00:01:33.950> battery<00:01:34.370> sitting<00:01:35.120> about<00:01:35.270> 13<00:01:35.690> volts

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
on not battery sitting about 13 volts

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.810 
on not battery sitting about 13 volts
but<00:01:36.170> the<00:01:36.350> charging<00:01:36.860> system<00:01:37.040> is<00:01:37.280> working<00:01:37.520> if

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
but the charging system is working if

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.610 
but the charging system is working if
you're<00:01:37.940> about<00:01:38.090> 13<00:01:38.690> so<00:01:38.900> if<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.080> green<00:01:39.350> lights

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:39.620 
you're about 13 so if the green lights

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.300 
you're about 13 so if the green lights
are<00:01:39.830> on<00:01:40.270> 13<00:01:41.270> to<00:01:41.390> 14<00:01:41.600> volts<00:01:41.870> the<00:01:42.830> charging

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
are on 13 to 14 volts the charging

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.390 
are on 13 to 14 volts the charging
systems<00:01:43.670> working<00:01:44.000> and<00:01:44.810> it<00:01:45.410> gets<00:01:45.560> up<00:01:45.740> to<00:01:45.860> 15

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
systems working and it gets up to 15

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.490 
systems working and it gets up to 15
that<00:01:47.000> means<00:01:47.270> your<00:01:47.420> regulator<00:01:47.900> is<00:01:48.020> gonna<00:01:48.200> fry

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
that means your regulator is gonna fry

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.620 
that means your regulator is gonna fry
your<00:01:48.680> battery<00:01:49.070> so<00:01:49.940> soon<00:01:50.150> as<00:01:50.210> you<00:01:50.270> turn<00:01:50.480> the

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
your battery so soon as you turn the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.000 
your battery so soon as you turn the
ignition<00:01:50.690> key<00:01:51.260> on<00:01:51.440> you'll<00:01:51.680> know<00:01:51.800> if<00:01:51.890> your

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
ignition key on you'll know if your

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.720 
ignition key on you'll know if your
battery's<00:01:52.460> good<00:01:52.700> or<00:01:52.790> not<00:01:52.940> so<00:01:54.280> this<00:01:55.280> is<00:01:55.490> good

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 
battery's good or not so this is good

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.910 
battery's good or not so this is good
because<00:01:55.990> sometimes<00:01:56.990> you<00:01:57.290> can<00:01:57.410> have<00:01:57.470> a<00:01:57.560> problem

behind this wire you know I have it
behind<00:02:30.260> that<00:02:30.709> then<00:02:31.459> it<00:02:31.640> comes<00:02:31.850> into<00:02:32.120> here<00:02:32.270> and

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
behind that then it comes into here and

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.610 
behind that then it comes into here and
it's<00:02:32.510> just<00:02:32.660> hooked<00:02:32.870> onto<00:02:33.050> the<00:02:33.230> ignition

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
it's just hooked onto the ignition

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.300 
it's just hooked onto the ignition
switch<00:02:33.800> and<00:02:34.630> just<00:02:35.630> to<00:02:35.840> say<00:02:36.200> other<00:02:36.620> things<00:02:36.800> I<00:02:37.250> do

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
switch and just to say other things I do

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.900 
switch and just to say other things I do
like<00:02:38.140> whenever<00:02:39.140> I<00:02:39.260> do<00:02:39.440> wiring<00:02:39.980> on<00:02:40.190> anything<00:02:40.580> I

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
like whenever I do wiring on anything I

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.330 
like whenever I do wiring on anything I
don't<00:02:41.150> care<00:02:41.209> if<00:02:41.360> it's<00:02:41.510> a<00:02:41.540> car<00:02:41.750> bike<00:02:42.220> like<00:02:43.220> you

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
don't care if it's a car bike like you

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.509 
don't care if it's a car bike like you
have<00:02:43.430> those<00:02:43.580> connectors<00:02:44.120> that<00:02:45.160> what<00:02:46.160> I'll<00:02:46.280> do

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
have those connectors that what I'll do

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.540 
have those connectors that what I'll do
is<00:02:46.790> if<00:02:47.050> I<00:02:48.050> don't<00:02:48.230> have<00:02:48.350> heat<00:02:48.560> shrink<00:02:48.950> wrap<00:02:49.190> and

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
is if I don't have heat shrink wrap and

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.190 
is if I don't have heat shrink wrap and
there's<00:02:50.450> a<00:02:50.540> connector

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
there's a connector

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.199 
there's a connector
I'll<00:02:51.290> put<00:02:51.769> super<00:02:52.190> weatherstrip<00:02:52.700> adhesive

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
I'll put super weatherstrip adhesive

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.710 
I'll put super weatherstrip adhesive
where<00:02:53.959> the<00:02:54.080> plastic<00:02:54.620> is<00:02:54.830> to<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.610> wire<00:02:56.180> itself

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
where the plastic is to the wire itself

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.800 
where the plastic is to the wire itself
so<00:02:57.530> water<00:02:57.830> can't<00:02:58.280> get<00:02:58.430> in<00:02:58.640> there<00:02:58.880> because<00:02:59.480> I

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
so water can't get in there because I

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.660 
so water can't get in there because I
might<00:03:00.380> take<00:03:00.560> years<00:03:00.830> before<00:03:01.100> the<00:03:01.400> thing<00:03:01.550> to

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
might take years before the thing to

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.100 
might take years before the thing to
corrode<00:03:02.000> but<00:03:02.239> I<00:03:02.269> want<00:03:02.540> to<00:03:02.630> make<00:03:02.750> sure<00:03:02.780> it's

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
corrode but I want to make sure it's

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.170 
corrode but I want to make sure it's
gonna<00:03:03.260> last<00:03:03.370> another<00:03:04.370> thing<00:03:04.610> I<00:03:04.730> do<00:03:04.790> I'm<00:03:05.060> gonna

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
gonna last another thing I do I'm gonna

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.759 
gonna last another thing I do I'm gonna
change<00:03:05.450> this<00:03:05.600> gauge<00:03:05.900> cuz<00:03:06.140> this<00:03:06.230> is<00:03:06.380> acrylic

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
change this gauge cuz this is acrylic

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.550 
change this gauge cuz this is acrylic
this<00:03:07.550> is<00:03:07.700> an<00:03:07.790> oil<00:03:07.910> pressure<00:03:08.300> gauge<00:03:08.450> you<00:03:09.410> know<00:03:09.530> I

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
this is an oil pressure gauge you know I

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.740 
this is an oil pressure gauge you know I
have<00:03:09.680> it<00:03:09.709> mounted<00:03:09.950> down<00:03:10.340> there<00:03:10.670> so<00:03:11.360> usually

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
have it mounted down there so usually

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.000 
have it mounted down there so usually
like<00:03:11.959> I<00:03:12.140> don't<00:03:12.260> know<00:03:12.410> I<00:03:12.440> think<00:03:12.560> some<00:03:12.860> of<00:03:12.890> the

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
like I don't know I think some of the

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.440 
like I don't know I think some of the
old<00:03:13.160> bikes<00:03:13.430> to<00:03:13.670> shovel<00:03:14.000> heads<00:03:14.180> that<00:03:14.269> used<00:03:14.420> to

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
old bikes to shovel heads that used to

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.150 
old bikes to shovel heads that used to
have<00:03:14.570> mounted<00:03:14.989> up<00:03:15.080> on<00:03:15.170> the<00:03:15.290> top<00:03:15.500> of<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:15.739> head<00:03:15.980> I

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
have mounted up on the top of the head I

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.030 
have mounted up on the top of the head I
just<00:03:17.030> routed<00:03:17.450> it<00:03:17.570> over<00:03:17.870> here<00:03:18.050> I<00:03:18.080> have<00:03:18.260> it<00:03:18.410> on<00:03:18.530> by

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
just routed it over here I have it on by

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.920 
just routed it over here I have it on by
the<00:03:19.100> foot<00:03:19.400> tag<00:03:19.610> it's<00:03:20.090> been<00:03:20.300> holding<00:03:20.600> up<00:03:20.720> it's

the foot tag it's been holding up it's

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.390 
the foot tag it's been holding up it's
just<00:03:21.050> at<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:21.320> acrylic<00:03:21.769> cuttle<00:03:22.040> yellow

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
just at the acrylic cuttle yellow
