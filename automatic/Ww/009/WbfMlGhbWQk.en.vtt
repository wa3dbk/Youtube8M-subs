00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:08.069
 chess tactics with gaining material 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.500
 time we note that the tactics are 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.110
 away the most important part of the game 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.629
 the endings the openings and the strategy are 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.150
 also all important but the tactics 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.470
 are important in each movement of 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.080
 every game 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.660
 if you made a tactical error you can 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.810
 pay for it for the rest of the game 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.030
 let's see in your next move the 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.890
 commit a tactical error and allow 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:36.719
 white stuff gain by force 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.690
 this movement is a great mistake of the 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.510
 black in the game until then they had not 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.149
 played poorly with this move 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.519
 they messed up everything looks like a movement 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.190
 natural but we will see how white 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.350
 will gain material 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.309
 the white horse is attacking king 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:00.449
 black and the tower at 8 that is called with 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.789
 fork also the queen in and 7 is under 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.350
 double attack of the queen and the tower 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.659
 white 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.439
 in addition to the black background 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.439
 it is weak 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.329
 this is the best move for the black 

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:16.700
 if the black ones capture the horse with the 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:19.950
 queen 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:25.289
 the white ones give a checkmate in few 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:31.820
 movements I see white sacrifices 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:31.820
 your queen and checkmate 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.980
 yes the black ones capture on a horse 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:47.940
 copy the white will capture the queen 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:47.940
 black and black captures the queen 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:03.860
 here horse captures tower / tower captures 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:06.470
 horse then white exchanged his 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.030
 horse by the black tower and leave 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.160
 winning in exchange 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.840
 now white can take advantage of this 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.840
 take advantage to win the game 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.250
 now that the dust has subsided we have arrived at a 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.040
 end of tower against bishop 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.980
 this is a standard plan after you have 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.020
 gain material swap parts and get into 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.510
 a game final where your advantage 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.580
 material is more effective 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.850
 basically the blacks are fighting 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.970
 only by a tie in this position but 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.640
 they will have no chance and after 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.790
 some other defenses they lost 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.360
 Do not let this happen to you. 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.360
 practice your tactics
