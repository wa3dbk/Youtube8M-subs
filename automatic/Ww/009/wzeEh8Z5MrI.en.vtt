that gives me some inspiration to fix

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.510 
that gives me some inspiration to fix
mine<00:00:46.110> because<00:00:46.440> not<00:00:46.649> only<00:00:46.680> goes<00:00:47.039> about<00:00:47.070> that

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
mine because not only goes about that

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.900

high<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:48.030> know<00:00:50.510> years<00:00:51.510> goes<00:00:51.719> even<00:00:52.020> higher

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.490 

I<00:00:54.940> think<00:00:55.630> there<00:00:55.750> might<00:00:55.930> be<00:00:55.989> a<00:00:56.140> little<00:00:56.230> taller

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
I think there might be a little taller

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.100 
I think there might be a little taller
than<00:00:56.650> mine<00:00:56.950> but<00:00:57.130> that's<00:00:57.340> still<00:00:57.610> look<00:00:57.930> plus<00:00:58.930> the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
than mine but that's still look plus the

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.570 
than mine but that's still look plus the
cars<00:00:59.410> on<00:00:59.710> the<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:01.800> standoff<00:01:02.800> yes<00:01:03.280> go<00:01:03.430> through

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
cars on the the standoff yes go through

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.320 
cars on the the standoff yes go through
the<00:01:03.640> pads<00:01:03.850> on<00:01:04.120> it

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
the pads on it

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.090 
the pads on it
yeah<00:01:04.570> and<00:01:04.870> so<00:01:05.080> it<00:01:05.199> might<00:01:05.530> have<00:01:05.650> another<00:01:05.890> two

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100
