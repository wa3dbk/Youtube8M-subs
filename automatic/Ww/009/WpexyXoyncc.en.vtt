makes detangling a breeze and so on but

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.119 
makes detangling a breeze and so on but
for<00:02:07.469> me<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:08.750> didn't<00:02:09.750> experience<00:02:10.080> that<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.890> I

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
for me I didn't experience that and I

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.880 
for me I didn't experience that and I
was<00:02:11.250> really<00:02:11.430> let<00:02:11.700> down<00:02:12.050> so

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
was really let down so

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.880

although<00:03:56.760> it's<00:03:57.330> a<00:03:57.420> spray<00:03:57.630> conditioner<00:03:57.840> I've

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
although it's a spray conditioner I've

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.180 
although it's a spray conditioner I've
never<00:03:58.470> used<00:03:58.680> it<00:03:58.830> before<00:03:59.209> I<00:04:00.209> actually<00:04:01.200> loved<00:04:01.980> it

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:08.199 
of indifferent about this product I just

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:14.870 
of indifferent about this product I just
feel<00:05:08.410> like<00:05:08.590> I<00:05:10.229> wasn't<00:05:11.229> able<00:05:11.380> to<00:05:11.560> experience<00:05:12.370> I

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
feel like I wasn't able to experience I

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.629 
feel like I wasn't able to experience I
wasn't<00:05:15.880> able<00:05:15.940> to<00:05:16.090> experience<00:05:17.430> the<00:05:18.430> full

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
wasn't able to experience the full

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:22.020 
wasn't able to experience the full
benefits<00:05:19.120> of<00:05:19.330> it<00:05:19.830> um<00:05:20.830> so<00:05:21.370> this<00:05:21.550> is<00:05:21.610> what<00:05:21.880> it

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
benefits of it um so this is what it

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.779 
benefits of it um so this is what it
looks<00:05:22.270> like<00:05:22.419> it's<00:05:23.110> like<00:05:23.260> a<00:05:24.900> it's<00:05:25.900> not<00:05:26.050> like<00:05:26.110> Jo

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:26.789 
looks like it's like a it's not like Jo

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:30.450 
looks like it's like a it's not like Jo
but<00:05:27.789> it's<00:05:27.940> not<00:05:28.090> like<00:05:28.240> pudding<00:05:29.130> it's<00:05:30.130> really

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
but it's not like pudding it's really

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.339 
but it's not like pudding it's really
loose<00:05:30.699> so<00:05:32.400> it's<00:05:33.400> a<00:05:33.580> really<00:05:33.820> nice<00:05:33.940> texture<00:05:34.449> that

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:35.349 
loose so it's a really nice texture that

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:37.560 
loose so it's a really nice texture that
did<00:05:35.590> find<00:05:35.860> as<00:05:36.159> I<00:05:36.639> got<00:05:36.820> towards<00:05:37.210> the<00:05:37.330> front

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
did find as I got towards the front

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.420 
did find as I got towards the front
sections<00:05:38.110> if<00:05:38.349> your<00:05:38.500> hair<00:05:38.710> was<00:05:38.740> not<00:05:39.099> like

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
sections if your hair was not like

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.719 
sections if your hair was not like
completely<00:05:40.440> dripping<00:05:41.440> wet<00:05:41.710> it<00:05:41.979> did<00:05:42.490> create

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 
completely dripping wet it did create

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:44.760 
completely dripping wet it did create
white<00:05:43.030> balls<00:05:43.300> and<00:05:43.690> it<00:05:44.050> started<00:05:44.470> to<00:05:44.620> feel

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
white balls and it started to feel

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.089 
white balls and it started to feel
sticky<00:05:45.389> so<00:05:46.389> yeah<00:05:46.930> I<00:05:46.960> didn't<00:05:47.590> like<00:05:47.620> that<00:05:47.770> about

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:48.099 
sticky so yeah I didn't like that about

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:50.879 
sticky so yeah I didn't like that about
this<00:05:48.340> at<00:05:49.180> all<00:05:49.389> but<00:05:50.020> other<00:05:50.169> than<00:05:50.380> that<00:05:50.440> I<00:05:50.590> really

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:50.889 
this at all but other than that I really

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:52.800 
this at all but other than that I really
did<00:05:51.039> love<00:05:51.159> this<00:05:51.340> product<00:05:51.580> towards<00:05:52.570> the<00:05:52.659> back

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
did love this product towards the back

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.290 
did love this product towards the back
of<00:05:52.960> my<00:05:53.050> head<00:05:53.260> when<00:05:53.440> my<00:05:53.560> hair<00:05:53.830> was<00:05:54.180> soaking<00:05:55.180> wet

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 
of my head when my hair was soaking wet

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.790 
of my head when my hair was soaking wet
when<00:05:55.510> I<00:05:55.539> first<00:05:55.780> got<00:05:55.900> out<00:05:55.960> of<00:05:56.139> the<00:05:56.199> shower<00:05:56.229> after

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
when I first got out of the shower after

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.580 
when I first got out of the shower after
I<00:05:56.830> applied<00:05:57.130> this<00:05:57.699> my<00:05:58.419> curls<00:05:58.720> really<00:05:59.080> did<00:05:59.260> clump

00:05:59.580 --> 00:05:59.590 
I applied this my curls really did clump

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:04.140 
I applied this my curls really did clump
together<00:05:59.770> but<00:06:01.199> it<00:06:02.199> wasn't<00:06:03.070> a<00:06:03.190> very<00:06:03.460> good<00:06:03.610> hold

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150 
together but it wasn't a very good hold

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.909 
together but it wasn't a very good hold
at<00:06:04.539> the<00:06:04.720> end<00:06:04.750> of<00:06:05.050> the<00:06:05.169> day<00:06:05.610> so<00:06:06.690> in<00:06:07.690> my<00:06:08.349> opinion<00:06:08.500> I

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:08.919 
at the end of the day so in my opinion I

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:12.240 
at the end of the day so in my opinion I
felt<00:06:09.190> like<00:06:09.340> in<00:06:10.210> between<00:06:11.199> these<00:06:11.500> two<00:06:11.830> you<00:06:12.099> need

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.250 
felt like in between these two you need

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.010 
felt like in between these two you need
another<00:06:12.610> step<00:06:13.000> especially<00:06:13.539> if<00:06:13.630> your<00:06:13.750> hair<00:06:13.780> is

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020 
another step especially if your hair is

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.279 
another step especially if your hair is
really<00:06:14.229> thick<00:06:14.530> like<00:06:14.740> mine<00:06:15.010> I<00:06:15.960> really<00:06:16.960> think

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:17.289 
really thick like mine I really think

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:20.520 
really thick like mine I really think
and<00:06:18.240> kind<00:06:19.240> of<00:06:19.330> coarse<00:06:19.630> hairs<00:06:19.990> pretty<00:06:20.229> coarse

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:20.530 
and kind of coarse hairs pretty coarse

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.800 
and kind of coarse hairs pretty coarse
um<00:06:20.889> so<00:06:21.400> I<00:06:21.430> feel<00:06:21.729> like<00:06:21.760> I<00:06:22.000> needed<00:06:22.210> something<00:06:22.690> in

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:22.810 
um so I feel like I needed something in

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.560 
um so I feel like I needed something in
between<00:06:22.990> these<00:06:23.500> two<00:06:23.830> to<00:06:24.490> help<00:06:24.760> with<00:06:25.000> styling

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:25.570 
between these two to help with styling

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:26.080 
between these two to help with styling
just

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.650
