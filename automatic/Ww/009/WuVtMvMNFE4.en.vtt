is<00:01:44.970> what<00:01:45.180> I'll<00:01:45.270> be<00:01:45.420> using<00:01:45.600> most<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.110> time

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
is what I'll be using most of the time

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.319 
is what I'll be using most of the time
we're<00:01:46.409> in<00:01:46.470> this<00:01:46.560> whole<00:01:46.740> thing<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.640> let's<00:01:48.210> go

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
we're in this whole thing so let's go

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.730 
we're in this whole thing so let's go
back<00:01:48.479> these<00:01:48.630> Christmas<00:01:49.020> lights<00:01:49.259> I've<00:01:49.500> already

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
back these Christmas lights I've already

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.380 
back these Christmas lights I've already
plugged<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.130> in<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.430> can<00:01:50.520> kind<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.790> see<00:01:51.000> we

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
plugged it in you can kind of see we

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.240 
plugged it in you can kind of see we
have<00:01:51.540> problems<00:01:52.020> these<00:01:52.649> lights<00:01:52.950> are<00:01:53.130> not

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
have problems these lights are not

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.100 
have problems these lights are not
working<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:54.180> what<00:01:54.329> we'll<00:01:54.479> do<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.780> we'll<00:01:54.930> just

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
working so what we'll do is we'll just

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.240 
working so what we'll do is we'll just
pull<00:01:55.290> any<00:01:55.439> light<00:01:55.710> out<00:01:55.860> here<00:01:55.890> it's<00:01:56.189> very

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
pull any light out here it's very

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.039 
pull any light out here it's very
important<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.180> there's<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.450> light<00:01:57.659> bulb<00:01:57.869> and

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
important that there's a light bulb and

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.480 
important that there's a light bulb and
every<00:01:58.259> single<00:01:58.500> one<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.649> these<00:01:58.799> otherwise

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
every single one of these otherwise

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.969 
every single one of these otherwise
that's<00:01:59.820> what's<00:02:00.090> ruing<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.320> continuity

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
that's what's ruing the the continuity

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.740 
that's what's ruing the the continuity
is<00:02:02.040> not<00:02:02.250> running<00:02:02.640> through<00:02:02.909> one<00:02:03.210> missing<00:02:03.540> bulb

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
is not running through one missing bulb

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.950 
is not running through one missing bulb
will<00:02:04.590> prevent<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.009> series<00:02:05.310> from<00:02:05.490> working<00:02:05.960> so

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
will prevent the series from working so

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.119 
will prevent the series from working so
what<00:02:07.110> I'm<00:02:07.170> gonna<00:02:07.290> do<00:02:07.380> I'm<00:02:07.710> gonna<00:02:07.799> go<00:02:07.950> ahead<00:02:08.009> and

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go ahead and

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.040 
what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go ahead and
pull<00:02:08.340> one<00:02:08.520> of<00:02:08.580> these<00:02:08.640> lights<00:02:08.910> out<00:02:09.119> all<00:02:09.929> right

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
pull one of these lights out all right

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.570 
pull one of these lights out all right
you<00:02:10.289> can<00:02:10.590> kind<00:02:10.739> of<00:02:10.770> see<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:10.979> socket

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
you can kind of see a socket

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.750 
you can kind of see a socket
like<00:02:12.180> keeper<00:02:12.510> Pro<00:02:12.750> here

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
kind of see even the bulb I put back in

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.330 
kind of see even the bulb I put back in
here<00:02:31.910> is<00:02:32.000> good<00:02:32.180> so<00:02:32.840> as<00:02:33.500> you<00:02:33.739> kind<00:02:33.890> of<00:02:34.010> go<00:02:34.160> in

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
here is good so as you kind of go in

here is good so as you kind of go in
here<00:02:34.670> you<00:02:34.700> kind<00:02:35.000> of<00:02:35.090> see<00:02:35.239> a<00:02:35.269> bad<00:02:35.540> bulb<00:02:35.810> here<00:02:36.140> and

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
here you kind of see a bad bulb here and

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.770 
here you kind of see a bad bulb here and
this<00:02:36.830> bulb<00:02:37.160> here<00:02:37.730> or<00:02:37.940> any<00:02:38.150> other<00:02:38.239> bulb<00:02:38.599> that's

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
this bulb here or any other bulb that's

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.080 
this bulb here or any other bulb that's
in<00:02:38.959> the<00:02:39.080> strand<00:02:39.440> like<00:02:39.560> this<00:02:39.620> one<00:02:39.920> here<00:02:40.280> these

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
in the strand like this one here these

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.940 
in the strand like this one here these
two<00:02:41.480> could<00:02:41.840> have<00:02:41.959> caused<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.349> problem<00:02:42.769> for

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
two could have caused the problem for

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.680 
two could have caused the problem for
just<00:02:43.280> this<00:02:43.459> portion<00:02:43.819> of<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.239> series<00:02:44.510> not

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
just this portion of the series not

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.509 
just this portion of the series not
working<00:02:45.110> and<00:02:45.709> what<00:02:45.860> happens<00:02:46.250> is<00:02:46.400> every

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
working and what happens is every

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.550 
working and what happens is every
lightbulb<00:02:46.849> has<00:02:47.239> some<00:02:47.420> chunks<00:02:47.780> in<00:02:47.900> them<00:02:48.019> and<00:02:48.200> it

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
lightbulb has some chunks in them and it

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.039 
lightbulb has some chunks in them and it
blows<00:02:48.799> out<00:02:49.160> it<00:02:49.970> just<00:02:50.000> prevents<00:02:50.540> a<00:02:50.690> series<00:02:51.019> that

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
blows out it just prevents a series that

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:52.900 
blows out it just prevents a series that
continuity<00:02:51.470> electricity<00:02:52.190> to<00:02:52.250> run<00:02:52.370> through<00:02:52.670> so

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
continuity electricity to run through so

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.130 
continuity electricity to run through so
what<00:02:53.060> happened<00:02:53.420> you<00:02:53.480> put<00:02:53.629> the<00:02:53.720> light<00:02:53.840> keeper

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
what happened you put the light keeper

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.930 
what happened you put the light keeper
product<00:02:54.560> you<00:02:54.920> start<00:02:55.190> to<00:02:55.280> pull<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:55.519> trigger<00:02:55.760> it

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
product you start to pull the trigger it

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.390 
product you start to pull the trigger it
kind<00:02:56.120> of<00:02:56.150> fuses<00:02:56.720> that<00:02:56.750> back<00:02:57.079> together<00:02:57.260> so<00:02:58.160> now

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
kind of fuses that back together so now
