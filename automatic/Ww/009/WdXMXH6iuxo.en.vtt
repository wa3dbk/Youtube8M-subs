also use salmon eggs and salmon eggs are

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.880 
also use salmon eggs and salmon eggs are
great<00:00:55.949> because<00:00:56.160> they<00:00:56.910> float<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:57.890> sometimes

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
great because they float so sometimes

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:59.750 
great because they float so sometimes
you<00:00:59.070> want<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.309> bait<00:00:59.489> on<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.730> bottom

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
you want the bait on the bottom

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.729 
you want the bait on the bottom
sometimes<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.719> want<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:00.989> popped<00:01:01.199> up<00:01:01.410> off<00:01:01.590> the

sometimes you want it popped up off the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.770 
sometimes you want it popped up off the
bottom<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.250> first<00:01:02.550> time<00:01:02.730> right<00:01:03.000> there<00:01:03.239> that

rig just keeping it real simple here's a
little<00:01:11.430> swivel<00:01:11.670> this<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.659> main<00:01:12.869> line

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
little swivel this is the main line

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.410 
little swivel this is the main line
right<00:01:13.500> here<00:01:13.799> leader<00:01:14.430> just<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.850> short<00:01:15.119> leader

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
right here leader just a short leader

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.499 
right here leader just a short leader
not<00:01:15.930> made<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.259> monofilament<00:01:16.770> but<00:01:17.310> made<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.729> just

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
not made a monofilament but made of just

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.999 
not made a monofilament but made of just
about<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.930> same<00:01:19.140> stuff<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.619> have<00:01:19.799> for

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
about the same stuff that you have for

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.539 
about the same stuff that you have for
mainline<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.030> braid<00:01:21.830> my<00:01:22.830> favorite<00:01:23.250> hook<00:01:23.400> is

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
mainline so a braid my favorite hook is

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.149 
mainline so a braid my favorite hook is
an<00:01:23.670> Eagle<00:01:23.939> Claw<00:01:24.799> 7226

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
an Eagle Claw 7226

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.190 
an Eagle Claw 7226
this<00:01:26.790> happens<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.240> be<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.390> little<00:01:27.600> longer<00:01:27.840> shank

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
this happens to be a little longer shank

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.289 
this happens to be a little longer shank
option<00:01:28.770> right<00:01:28.979> here<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.369> then<00:01:29.880> there's<00:01:30.240> a

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
option right here and then there's a

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.679 
option right here and then there's a
piece<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:30.840> nylon<00:01:31.710> right<00:01:32.490> here<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.420> keeps

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
piece of nylon right here and that keeps

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.149 
piece of nylon right here and that keeps
that<00:01:33.869> line<00:01:34.110> straight<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.740> doesn't<00:01:35.040> tangle

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
that line straight so it doesn't tangle

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.899 
that line straight so it doesn't tangle
around<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.640> swivel<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.810> next<00:01:37.079> step<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.759> to<00:01:38.759> go

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
around the swivel the next step is to go

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.240 
around the swivel the next step is to go
to<00:01:38.970> your<00:01:39.060> baiting<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:40.140> I'm<00:01:40.500> gonna<00:01:40.650> go<00:01:40.799> back<00:01:41.009> to

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
to your baiting and I'm gonna go back to

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.030 
to your baiting and I'm gonna go back to
the<00:01:41.369> tutti-frutti<00:01:42.439> so<00:01:43.439> all<00:01:43.560> we're<00:01:43.680> gonna<00:01:43.770> do

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
the tutti-frutti so all we're gonna do

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.609 
the tutti-frutti so all we're gonna do
is<00:01:44.360> the<00:01:45.360> bait<00:01:45.540> needle<00:01:45.869> goes<00:01:46.049> straight<00:01:46.560> through

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
is the bait needle goes straight through

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.380

to use a piece of corn
like<00:01:53.250> we're<00:01:53.430> baiting<00:01:53.759> with<00:01:54.680> and<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.740> bait

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
like we're baiting with and the bait

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.499 
like we're baiting with and the bait
needle<00:01:56.250> has<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.430> little<00:01:56.729> tiny<00:01:56.939> hook<00:01:57.240> on<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.479> end

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
needle has a little tiny hook on the end

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.889 
needle has a little tiny hook on the end
of<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:58.009> now<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.040> hair<00:01:59.310> rig<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.729> actually<00:02:00.180> the

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
of it now a hair rig is actually the

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.420 
of it now a hair rig is actually the
hook<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.350> then<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.469> little<00:02:01.649> piece<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:01.950> rigging

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
hook and then a little piece of rigging

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.550 
hook and then a little piece of rigging
in<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.390> bait<00:02:03.600> itself<00:02:04.049> is<00:02:04.229> not<00:02:04.350> going

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
in the and the bait itself is not going

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.870 
in the and the bait itself is not going
to<00:02:04.619> go<00:02:04.740> on<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.979> hook<00:02:05.159> it's<00:02:05.340> going<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.579> go<00:02:05.670> on

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
to go on the hook it's going to go on

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.990 
to go on the hook it's going to go on
this<00:02:06.110> hair<00:02:07.110> sticking<00:02:07.710> out<00:02:07.950> of<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.520> guess<00:02:08.819> you'd

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
this hair sticking out of I guess you'd

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.250 
this hair sticking out of I guess you'd
say

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260 
say

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.410 
say
so<00:02:11.260> now<00:02:11.440> the<00:02:12.370> bait<00:02:12.550> needle<00:02:12.880> has<00:02:13.030> a<00:02:13.060> little<00:02:13.330> hook

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
so now the bait needle has a little hook

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.110 
so now the bait needle has a little hook
on<00:02:13.600> it<00:02:13.980> that's<00:02:14.980> in<00:02:15.250> a<00:02:15.340> little<00:02:15.550> loop<00:02:15.730> on<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.090> end

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
on it that's in a little loop on the end

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.870 
on it that's in a little loop on the end
I<00:02:16.450> slide<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.930> corn<00:02:17.140> on<00:02:17.350> down<00:02:17.620> I<00:02:17.920> slide<00:02:18.700> the

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
I slide the corn on down I slide the

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:25.380 
I slide the corn on down I slide the
boilie<00:02:19.210> on<00:02:19.390> down<00:02:19.660> I<00:02:21.510> take<00:02:22.510> this<00:02:23.440> off<00:02:23.680> now<00:02:24.390> we

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
boilie on down I take this off now we

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.150 
boilie on down I take this off now we
need<00:02:25.630> one<00:02:26.020> of<00:02:26.050> these<00:02:26.230> just<00:02:26.620> little<00:02:26.860> nylon

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
need one of these just little nylon

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.910 
need one of these just little nylon
clips<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:28.150> this<00:02:29.140> all<00:02:29.320> might<00:02:29.530> seem<00:02:29.800> a<00:02:29.830> little

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
clips and this all might seem a little

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.640 
clips and this all might seem a little
complicated<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.820> you<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.810> begin<00:02:32.110> with<00:02:32.290> but<00:02:32.560> if

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
complicated to you to begin with but if

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:33.930 
complicated to you to begin with but if
you<00:02:32.740> get<00:02:32.860> into<00:02:33.010> carp<00:02:33.280> fishing<00:02:33.490> it's<00:02:33.700> really

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
you get into carp fishing it's really

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:34.560 
you get into carp fishing it's really
really<00:02:34.180> simple

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
really simple

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.930 
really simple
this<00:02:35.140> little<00:02:35.440> stopper<00:02:36.250> goes<00:02:36.460> right<00:02:36.700> on<00:02:36.850> the

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
this little stopper goes right on the

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.490 
this little stopper goes right on the
end<00:02:37.090> of<00:02:37.270> that<00:02:37.420> loop<00:02:40.050> then<00:02:41.050> you<00:02:41.140> slide<00:02:41.470> the

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
end of that loop then you slide the

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:48.690 
end of that loop then you slide the
boilie<00:02:42.250> up<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:42.550> keep<00:02:42.730> it<00:02:42.850> in<00:02:42.970> place<00:02:47.400> so<00:02:48.400> there's

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
boilie up to keep it in place so there's

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.300 
boilie up to keep it in place so there's
your<00:02:48.970> rigging<00:02:49.530> actually<00:02:50.530> not<00:02:50.710> on<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:51.130> hook

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
your rigging actually not on the hook

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.430 
your rigging actually not on the hook
the<00:02:52.000> carp<00:02:52.240> sucks<00:02:52.540> this<00:02:52.780> up<00:02:52.960> it's<00:02:53.170> in<00:02:53.290> Lou's

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
the carp sucks this up it's in Lou's

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.220 
the carp sucks this up it's in Lou's
mouth<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.890> hook<00:02:54.040> just<00:02:54.250> goes<00:02:54.460> right<00:02:54.700> in

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
mouth the hook just goes right in

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.300 
mouth the hook just goes right in
naturally<00:02:56.230> along<00:02:56.440> with<00:02:56.680> it<00:02:56.830> you<00:02:57.160> almost

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
naturally along with it you almost

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.690 
naturally along with it you almost
always<00:02:57.670> get<00:02:58.000> hooks<00:02:58.240> because<00:02:58.630> the<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:59.520> hook<00:03:00.520> is

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
always get hooks because the the hook is

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.180 
always get hooks because the the hook is
exposed<00:03:01.180> obviously<00:03:01.810> this<00:03:02.500> is<00:03:02.710> really<00:03:02.980> truly

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
exposed obviously this is really truly
