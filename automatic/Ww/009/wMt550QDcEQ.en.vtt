00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
oh they're like eight bucks

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:41.070 
oh they're like eight bucks
start<00:01:32.380> in<00:01:32.560> the<00:01:32.680> middle<00:01:35.880> got<00:01:36.880> drilling<00:01:40.080> now

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
start in the middle got drilling now

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.180 
start in the middle got drilling now
that<00:01:41.320> mole<00:01:41.560> is<00:01:41.710> not<00:01:41.920> big<00:01:42.160> enough<00:01:42.190> so<00:01:42.700> I<00:01:44.100> got<00:01:45.100> to

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
that mole is not big enough so I got to

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:52.230 
that mole is not big enough so I got to
make<00:01:45.310> it<00:01:45.370> bigger<00:01:50.790> holding<00:01:51.790> with<00:01:51.910> a<00:01:51.940> pair<00:01:52.210> of

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
make it bigger holding with a pair of

00:01:52.240 --> 00:02:01.770 
make it bigger holding with a pair of
pliers

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.000 

so<00:02:02.780> you<00:02:02.870> get<00:02:03.050> to<00:02:03.200> about<00:02:03.410> the<00:02:03.560> right<00:02:03.740> size<00:02:06.010> the

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
so you get to about the right size the

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.110 
so you get to about the right size the
next<00:02:07.400> step<00:02:09.310> it's<00:02:10.310> what<00:02:10.520> you<00:02:10.640> wanted<00:02:10.910> to<00:02:11.000> look

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
next step it's what you wanted to look

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:20.410 
next step it's what you wanted to look
like<00:02:12.190> let's<00:02:13.190> see<00:02:13.310> if<00:02:13.400> I<00:02:13.490> can<00:02:13.670> set<00:02:13.820> this<00:02:13.940> up

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.810 

the<00:02:20.900> next<00:02:21.260> step<00:02:21.500> will<00:02:22.430> take<00:02:22.640> that<00:02:22.880> V<00:02:23.260> squeezing

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
the next step will take that V squeezing

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.950 
the next step will take that V squeezing
I'm<00:02:25.820> squeezing<00:02:25.850> it<00:02:26.980> put<00:02:27.980> it<00:02:28.100> into<00:02:28.400> that<00:02:28.960> push

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
I'm squeezing it put it into that push

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.180 
I'm squeezing it put it into that push
and<00:02:30.350> twist<00:02:32.230> both<00:02:33.230> that's<00:02:33.620> that's<00:02:34.100> a

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
and twist both that's that's a

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.460 
and twist both that's that's a
watertight<00:02:34.580> seal<00:02:34.850> so<00:02:35.450> this<00:02:35.660> is<00:02:35.840> what<00:02:36.020> it<00:02:36.140> look

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
watertight seal so this is what it look

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.750 
watertight seal so this is what it look
like<00:02:36.500> in<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:37.130> end<00:02:39.040> that's<00:02:40.040> what<00:02:40.400> I'll<00:02:40.580> look

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
like in the end that's what I'll look

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.620 
like in the end that's what I'll look
like<00:02:40.820> in<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.360> end<00:02:41.620> then<00:02:42.620> you<00:02:42.650> take<00:02:43.300> the<00:02:44.300> water

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
like in the end then you take the water

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:55.870 
like in the end then you take the water
bottle<00:02:46.090> which<00:02:47.090> is<00:02:47.120> here<00:02:50.530> run<00:02:51.530> it<00:02:51.560> on<00:02:54.550> okay<00:02:55.580> well
