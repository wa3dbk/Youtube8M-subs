aren't<00:03:05.430> moving<00:03:05.640> it<00:03:06.800> looks<00:03:07.800> as<00:03:08.010> though<00:03:08.040> that

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
aren't moving it looks as though that

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.699 
aren't moving it looks as though that
they're<00:03:08.640> supposed<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.239> swivel<00:03:09.660> looks<00:03:10.620> as

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
they're supposed to swivel looks as

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.520 
they're supposed to swivel looks as
though<00:03:10.800> they're<00:03:10.950> supposed<00:03:11.310> to<00:03:11.430> swivel<00:03:12.290> but<00:03:13.290> it

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
though they're supposed to swivel but it

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:21.680 
though they're supposed to swivel but it
just<00:03:13.830> doesn't<00:03:14.040> seem<00:03:14.549> to<00:03:14.790> work<00:03:17.570> work<00:03:20.330> which<00:03:21.330> is

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
just doesn't seem to work work which is

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.949 
just doesn't seem to work work which is
rather<00:03:22.590> concerning<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:24.090> scope<00:03:24.299> the<00:03:24.660> scope

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
rather concerning the scope the scope

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.490 
rather concerning the scope the scope
worked<00:03:25.230> on<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.650> new<00:03:26.390> you<00:03:27.390> leave<00:03:27.660> the<00:03:28.290> Scott

worked on the new you leave the Scott

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.860 
worked on the new you leave the Scott
work<00:03:28.709> on<00:03:28.860> the<00:03:28.980> arm<00:03:29.130> here<00:03:29.430> though<00:03:29.640> is<00:03:29.880> rather

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
work on the arm here though is rather

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.220 
work on the arm here though is rather
nice<00:03:31.340> and<00:03:32.340> obviously<00:03:33.209> the<00:03:33.780> biggest

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
nice and obviously the biggest

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.930 
nice and obviously the biggest
difference<00:03:34.769> between<00:03:34.830> this<00:03:35.190> figure<00:03:35.700> and<00:03:35.850> the

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
difference between this figure and the

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.530 
difference between this figure and the
elite<00:03:36.180> he<00:03:36.720> will<00:03:36.840> for<00:03:37.019> elite<00:03:37.230> sell<00:03:37.500> it<00:03:37.650> is<00:03:37.830> the

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
elite he will for elite sell it is the

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.509 
elite he will for elite sell it is the
paint<00:03:39.540> job<00:03:39.750> which<00:03:40.350> is<00:03:40.500> also<00:03:40.650> pretty<00:03:41.130> good<00:03:41.400> on

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
paint job which is also pretty good on

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.400 
paint job which is also pretty good on
this<00:03:41.640> figure<00:03:42.000> I<00:03:42.030> cannot<00:03:42.540> I<00:03:42.780> don't<00:03:43.080> haven't

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
this figure I cannot I don't haven't

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.360 
this figure I cannot I don't haven't
found<00:03:43.650> any<00:03:45.470> oddities<00:03:46.470> in<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.860> paint<00:03:47.100> job<00:03:47.340> that

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
found any oddities in the paint job that

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.130 
found any oddities in the paint job that
makes<00:03:48.209> me<00:03:48.420> make<00:03:49.260> me<00:03:49.410> think<00:03:49.620> oh<00:03:50.180> this<00:03:51.180> figures<00:03:51.780> a

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
makes me make me think oh this figures a

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.090 
makes me make me think oh this figures a
bit<00:03:52.590> mediocre<00:03:53.220> in<00:03:53.370> his<00:03:53.489> paint<00:03:53.730> job<00:03:54.890> the<00:03:55.890> paint

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
bit mediocre in his paint job the paint

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.220 
bit mediocre in his paint job the paint
job<00:03:56.250> spiffy<00:03:56.790> and<00:03:57.150> it's<00:03:57.330> nice<00:03:57.870> to<00:03:58.080> look<00:03:58.200> at<00:03:58.410> and

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
job spiffy and it's nice to look at and

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.289 
job spiffy and it's nice to look at and
is<00:04:01.230> pretty<00:04:01.739> much<00:04:01.860> all<00:04:02.100> the<00:04:02.250> articulate<00:04:02.790> all

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299

a little bit rubbery but as to why that
hole<00:04:57.280> is<00:04:57.550> there<00:04:57.820> is<00:04:59.040> concerning<00:05:01.260> but<00:05:02.260> yeah<00:05:02.500> he

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
hole is there is concerning but yeah he

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.640 
hole is there is concerning but yeah he
holds<00:05:03.190> it<00:05:03.280> fine<00:05:03.870> whether<00:05:04.870> that's<00:05:05.050> whether

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
holds it fine whether that's whether

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 
other side so yeah articulation is

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.710 
other side so yeah articulation is
exactly<00:06:34.660> the<00:06:34.870> same<00:06:35.020> as<00:06:35.080> an<00:06:35.320> elite<00:06:35.530> zealot<00:06:36.009> and

poorly zealot from naval force there is
one<00:06:48.280> you<00:06:48.520> might<00:06:48.699> like<00:06:48.940> this<00:06:49.120> figure<00:06:49.510> if<00:06:50.500> you

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:50.650 
one you might like this figure if you

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.320 
one you might like this figure if you
like<00:06:50.800> killing<00:06:51.070> dama<00:06:51.430> you'll<00:06:51.910> like<00:06:52.150> this

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:02.180 
figure empty if you just want an elite
figure<00:06:58.090> he<00:06:58.360> is<00:06:58.389> pretty<00:06:58.720> good<00:07:00.630> waiting<00:07:01.630> for

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:02.190 
figure he is pretty good waiting for

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:09.600 
figure he is pretty good waiting for
custom<00:07:03.190> of<00:07:03.430> a<00:07:04.620> storm<00:07:05.620> elite<00:07:05.919> or<00:07:06.220> ghek<00:07:06.940> I<00:07:08.610> see

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:09.610 
custom of a storm elite or ghek I see

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.510 
custom of a storm elite or ghek I see
the<00:07:09.820> potential<00:07:10.150> and<00:07:10.509> I<00:07:11.320> see<00:07:11.560> that<00:07:11.590> fing<00:07:12.160> see

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:12.520 
the potential and I see that fing see

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.439 
the potential and I see that fing see
and<00:07:12.639> think<00:07:12.849> it<00:07:13.000> can<00:07:13.210> be<00:07:13.240> done<00:07:14.430> so<00:07:15.430> overall<00:07:16.030> he

00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:16.449 
and think it can be done so overall he

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:22.200 
and think it can be done so overall he
is<00:07:16.510> a<00:07:16.570> pretty<00:07:16.780> good<00:07:16.990> figure<00:07:20.370> so<00:07:21.370> this<00:07:21.820> is<00:07:21.849> Tahu

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:22.210 
is a pretty good figure so this is Tahu

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:25.979 
is a pretty good figure so this is Tahu
King<00:07:22.479> signing<00:07:22.870> out<00:07:23.020> and<00:07:23.289> goodbye
