00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.850
 well found in the kitchen of the stamped 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.850
 also this evening for a recipe a 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.580
 first course based on fish 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.250
 the spaghetti holder in this case 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.830
 concrete a new pasta spaghetti 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.259
 it is not dried pasta with carbonara di mare 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.380
 who works at sea because instead of 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.000
 use flying spain that 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.520
 absolutely in the uses in the 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.180
 classic carbonara but to use the 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.590
 liquid of ok things the first 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.600
 what to do when 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.420
 maybe we fix those tanks of 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:53.469
 clean them naturally then put them on 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.660
 bath with water and salt put in one 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:58.679
 bacchettona with very little traffic in 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.749
 so that the mussels start to open 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:04.360
 look for water and therefore at the moment it is the 

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:06.010
 time to stay slam them so that the 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.270
 sand that if the inter I do n't go out on fire 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.250
 this procedure you need to do 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.610
 at least two or three times so 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:15.780
 above all, the clams should be lost 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.880
 all the key sand they have 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.850
 second step is to cook them 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.790
 I here already cooked mussels and previously 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.460
 clams as I used in one 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.780
 pan committed garlic poached 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:34.180
 that broad with its peel 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.580
 slightly crushed then two years of 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.560
 parsley leaves parsley 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:43.330
 I therefore state a little wine 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:45.910
 white and go covered cooking like 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.580
 you see that the first one gloats in the first one 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:51.070
 What it opens in time to extinguish 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.920
 that moment makes you cool down 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.979
 they are fruitful in this case 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:01.509
 the beautiful of the bomb the phrase of the 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:04.750
 home and the liquid that remains do not do 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.940
 other than to filter it pass it or in one is 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.100
 a clear mine or otherwise in a colander 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.209
 very very fine so as to recover 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:18.520
 all the possible pebbles 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:20.170
 sand shells then second pass 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.130
 what we have to do is to put in 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.560
 boil water 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.400
 always remember a given liter 10 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.989
 grams of salt 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:33.459
 in the meantime that proposes it positioned 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:37.180
 on a pan in this case the game 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:40.930
 to ask what I do believe in 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.860
 I go to cut bacon very very much 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.370
 thin just like a classic 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.980
 bacon and egg 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.620
 I do not put onion and I go to roast the 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.660
 without putting any kind of fat there 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.420
 I can also add the garlic in 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:03:00.450
 shirt and in the meantime I go to prepare 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:07.319
 the classic carbonara thing I use 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:14.910
 eggs 2 egg yolks then around the 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:19.080
 ricotta and to end up denying everything 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:21.599
 make me much more liquid today 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:26.150
 turns all the liquid into the mussels of 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:32.370
 previously recovered clams 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:37.069
 cooking I go to the beach and I get 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:40.980
 therefore a liquid and a density 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:42.959
 so classic of the capone then 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.930
 prepared he liquidated it I do nothing else 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.030
 that put the water back but you want to see that 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:53.269
 what do i do add in 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.269
 broccoli for detailed small 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:02.590
 together with the broccoli pathology ad 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:04.900
 already add the spaghetti and pasta 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.819
 fresh them this we have a cooking 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.250
 approximately 4 minutes 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:12.299
 what the manual spaghetti instead 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.980
 having in safe circulation 7 reds 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:19.019
 it depends a little on the size of the 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:22.389
 spaghetti we do not keep turned wait 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:26.710
 cooking is completed in the meantime 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:27.639
 that the pasta cooks we went the diet 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.520
 well 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:33.759
 how do you see the beautiful thing bacon in the 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:39.030
 facade then we add the clouds le 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:39.030
 things that we have already set previously 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.830
 MondolÃ© 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.030
 then if you want to add that too 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.570
 we cannot say that here 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.280
 very shy you can add some 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:59.800
 scallops add calendars are 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:02.180
 that kind of you so much good at culture 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.960
 really ultimate pasta 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:11.930
 let's go take out the pasta 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:15.820
 we put mussel and bacon setting 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.820
 clams and let's insert inside 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:24.199
 our pasta then put inside 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:26.870
 spaghetti with various vegetables and if 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:31.340
 they did n't want to attack and the pain that 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:39.639
 I go to insert the prepared mixture into 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:43.820
 Previously , move the comics and ricotta 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:47.620
 let it dry for important good 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:50.750
 don't go cook place so you have to 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.849
 check the face to see that it can't 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.900
 to re-propose it only food made there 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:56.860
 omelette 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:06:01.479
 when you see that they are beautiful and famous 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:05.300
 just you see it from the Loredan arch 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:10.760

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:11.980
