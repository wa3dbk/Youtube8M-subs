00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
that I like about these microphones is

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.450 
that I like about these microphones is
they<00:00:33.510> isolate<00:00:34.200> sound<00:00:34.559> really<00:00:35.010> really<00:00:35.130> well

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
they isolate sound really really well

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.729 
they isolate sound really really well
you<00:00:36.059> can<00:00:36.270> get<00:00:36.420> mics<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.750> sound<00:00:37.170> very<00:00:37.500> nice

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
you can get mics that sound very nice

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.319 
you can get mics that sound very nice
like<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:39.530> 8020<00:00:40.530> 20<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.100> really<00:00:41.940> really<00:00:42.059> nice

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
like a 8020 20 is a really really nice

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.740 
like a 8020 20 is a really really nice
mic<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:43.020> USB<00:00:43.920> mic<00:00:44.160> that's<00:00:44.670> convenient<00:00:45.390> for

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
mic a USB mic that's convenient for

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.750 
mic a USB mic that's convenient for
doing<00:00:46.020> things<00:00:46.230> but<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.100> just<00:00:47.280> doesn't<00:00:47.520> isolate

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
doing things but it just doesn't isolate

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.250 
doing things but it just doesn't isolate
sounds<00:00:48.390> well<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:48.809> if<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:48.989> kids<00:00:49.110> are

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
sounds well and so if the kids are

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.229 
sounds well and so if the kids are
playing<00:00:49.350> in<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.680> road<00:00:49.860> other<00:00:50.100> room<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.489> fans<00:00:50.969> on

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
playing in the road other room a fans on

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.020 
playing in the road other room a fans on
anything<00:00:51.920> you<00:00:52.920> hear<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.460> these

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
anything you hear it and these

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.630 
anything you hear it and these
microphones<00:00:54.660> do<00:00:54.960> much<00:00:55.379> much<00:00:55.770> much<00:00:56.070> better<00:00:56.340> at

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
microphones do much much much better at

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.660 
microphones do much much much better at
isolating<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.989> sound<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.710> voice<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.250> just

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
isolating the sound of the voice of just

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.330 
isolating the sound of the voice of just
being<00:01:00.149> very<00:01:00.180> very<00:01:00.600> directional<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.219> have

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
being very very directional so you have

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.740 
being very very directional so you have
to<00:01:02.430> be<00:01:02.520> close<00:01:02.789> up<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.120> microphone<00:01:03.570> if

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
to be close up to the microphone if

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.030 
to be close up to the microphone if
you're<00:01:03.930> far<00:01:04.110> away<00:01:04.260> from<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.589> microphone<00:01:04.739> it

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
you're far away from the microphone it

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.719 
you're far away from the microphone it
just<00:01:05.220> does<00:01:05.400> not<00:01:05.430> sound<00:01:05.850> as<00:01:06.060> good<00:01:06.920> so<00:01:07.920> let's<00:01:08.549> do

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
just does not sound as good so let's do

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.880 
just does not sound as good so let's do
a<00:01:08.760> head-to-head<00:01:09.299> comparison<00:01:09.600> I'm<00:01:10.320> using<00:01:10.680> the

microphones if I'm really picky and I go

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.590 
microphones if I'm really picky and I go
into<00:01:56.810> a<00:01:56.930> dark<00:01:57.170> room<00:01:57.290> and<00:01:57.830> I<00:01:58.070> do<00:01:58.130> some

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.720 
the hyal does have just a little bit
less<00:02:05.090> clarity<00:02:05.780> in<00:02:06.260> the<00:02:06.470> voice<00:02:06.680> it<00:02:07.370> sounds

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
less clarity in the voice it sounds

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.840 
less clarity in the voice it sounds
lower<00:02:08.530> there's<00:02:09.530> just<00:02:09.800> a<00:02:09.920> little<00:02:10.190> bit<00:02:10.399> more

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
lower there's just a little bit more

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.260 
lower there's just a little bit more
muffle<00:02:11.660> to<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.350> sound<00:02:12.620> very<00:02:13.370> very<00:02:13.520> very

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
muffle to the sound very very very

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.500 
muffle to the sound very very very
slight<00:02:14.750> but<00:02:15.110> I<00:02:16.100> do<00:02:16.220> notice<00:02:16.700> it<00:02:16.970> just<00:02:17.300> barely

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
slight but I do notice it just barely

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.620 
slight but I do notice it just barely
again<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:19.340> reason<00:02:19.760> that<00:02:19.910> I<00:02:19.970> care<00:02:20.330> about<00:02:20.360> that

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
again the reason that I care about that

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.810 
again the reason that I care about that
and<00:02:21.140> again<00:02:21.590> it's<00:02:21.800> not<00:02:21.860> that<00:02:22.190> big<00:02:22.400> of<00:02:22.430> a<00:02:22.580> deal

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
and again it's not that big of a deal

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.420 
and again it's not that big of a deal
but<00:02:23.300> the<00:02:23.870> reason<00:02:24.230> that<00:02:24.260> I<00:02:24.380> care<00:02:24.680> about<00:02:24.709> it<00:02:25.010> is<00:02:25.160> I

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
but the reason that I care about it is I

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.640 
but the reason that I care about it is I
listen<00:02:25.970> to<00:02:26.060> podcasts<00:02:26.240> on<00:02:26.720> one<00:02:26.990> and<00:02:27.110> a<00:02:27.170> half<00:02:27.350> or

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
listen to podcasts on one and a half or

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.170 
listen to podcasts on one and a half or
two<00:02:27.709> times<00:02:28.160> speed<00:02:28.490> and<00:02:28.700> that's<00:02:28.760> what<00:02:29.030> I'm

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
two times speed and that's what I'm

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.390 
two times speed and that's what I'm
using<00:02:29.420> these<00:02:29.660> microphones<00:02:30.200> I<00:02:30.530> produce<00:02:31.070> the

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
using these microphones I produce the

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.290 
using these microphones I produce the
improve<00:02:31.970> photography<00:02:32.870> podcast<00:02:33.410> and<00:02:33.740> I<00:02:34.610> listen

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
improve photography podcast and I listen

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.640 
improve photography podcast and I listen
to<00:02:35.360> podcasts<00:02:35.810> on<00:02:35.930> one<00:02:36.080> and<00:02:36.200> a<00:02:36.230> half<00:02:36.350> or<00:02:36.530> two

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
to podcasts on one and a half or two

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.370 
to podcasts on one and a half or two
times<00:02:36.860> speed<00:02:37.190> and<00:02:37.430> so<00:02:38.360> if<00:02:38.450> a<00:02:38.570> podcast<00:02:39.020> doesn't

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
times speed and so if a podcast doesn't

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.770 
times speed and so if a podcast doesn't
have<00:02:39.530> perfect<00:02:40.100> clarity<00:02:40.459> in<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:40.850> voice<00:02:41.030> it's

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
have perfect clarity in the voice it's

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.020 
have perfect clarity in the voice it's
you<00:02:42.350> can't<00:02:42.620> listen<00:02:42.860> to<00:02:43.070> it<00:02:43.250> as<00:02:43.370> fast<00:02:43.670> and<00:02:43.940> I

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
you can't listen to it as fast and I

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.210 
you can't listen to it as fast and I
just<00:02:44.390> don't<00:02:44.570> listen<00:02:44.810> at<00:02:45.050> one<00:02:45.200> time<00:02:45.410> speed<00:02:45.739> the

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
just don't listen at one time speed the

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.890 
just don't listen at one time speed the
audio<00:02:46.580> quality<00:02:46.730> has<00:02:47.239> to<00:02:47.420> be<00:02:47.510> really<00:02:47.810> really

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
audio quality has to be really really

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.900 
audio quality has to be really really
good<00:02:48.200> or<00:02:48.380> I<00:02:48.410> just<00:02:48.500> won't<00:02:48.830> subscribe<00:02:49.430> to<00:02:49.610> a<00:02:49.640> plot

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
good or I just won't subscribe to a plot

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.940 
good or I just won't subscribe to a plot
to<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:50.180> podcast<00:02:50.470> there<00:02:51.470> are<00:02:51.530> too<00:02:51.650> many<00:02:51.739> out

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
to a podcast there are too many out

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.910 
to a podcast there are too many out
there<00:02:51.980> to<00:02:52.280> choose<00:02:52.489> from<00:02:52.820> so<00:02:53.570> I<00:02:54.019> did<00:02:54.680> notice

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
there to choose from so I did notice

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.530 
there to choose from so I did notice
that<00:02:55.190> from<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.489> hyal<00:02:55.760> but<00:02:56.000> it<00:02:56.090> is<00:02:56.209> just<00:02:56.420> very

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
that from the hyal but it is just very

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.220 
that from the hyal but it is just very
very<00:02:57.019> very<00:02:57.650> slight<00:02:58.070> but<00:02:58.820> I<00:02:59.510> will<00:02:59.750> say<00:02:59.930> that<00:02:59.959> the

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
very very slight but I will say that the

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.710 
very very slight but I will say that the
hyal<00:03:00.440> does<00:03:00.800> have<00:03:01.070> a<00:03:01.100> slightly<00:03:01.640> more<00:03:01.910> full

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
hyal does have a slightly more full

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.810 
hyal does have a slightly more full
voice<00:03:03.260> it's<00:03:03.950> not<00:03:04.220> quite<00:03:04.910> as<00:03:05.150> thin<00:03:05.989> as<00:03:06.290> the<00:03:07.280> pro

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
voice it's not quite as thin as the pro

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.410 
voice it's not quite as thin as the pro
caster<00:03:08.620> which<00:03:09.620> is<00:03:09.800> a<00:03:09.830> nice<00:03:10.100> thing<00:03:10.400> but<00:03:10.430> if<00:03:11.150> I

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
caster which is a nice thing but if I

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.300 
caster which is a nice thing but if I
were<00:03:11.600> to<00:03:11.780> compare<00:03:12.170> the<00:03:12.350> audio<00:03:12.620> quality<00:03:12.830> I

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
were to compare the audio quality I

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.180 
were to compare the audio quality I
would<00:03:13.790> probably<00:03:14.239> give<00:03:14.810> a<00:03:14.840> little<00:03:15.290> edge<00:03:15.709> to<00:03:15.739> the

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
would probably give a little edge to the

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.400 
would probably give a little edge to the
road<00:03:16.370> procaster<00:03:16.910> even<00:03:17.360> though<00:03:17.480> they're<00:03:17.630> so<00:03:18.050> so

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
road procaster even though they're so so

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.250 
road procaster even though they're so so
similar<00:03:18.950> but<00:03:19.820> the<00:03:20.060> big<00:03:20.209> difference<00:03:20.450> is<00:03:20.870> price

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
similar but the big difference is price

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.560 
similar but the big difference is price
the<00:03:21.950> road<00:03:22.160> procaster<00:03:22.670> cost<00:03:23.150> more<00:03:23.390> than<00:03:23.510> a

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
the road procaster cost more than a

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.479 
the road procaster cost more than a
hundred<00:03:24.050> bucks<00:03:24.260> cheaper<00:03:24.590> than<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.070> aisle<00:03:25.280> at

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
hundred bucks cheaper than the aisle at

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.729 
hundred bucks cheaper than the aisle at
least<00:03:25.700> at<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:26.000> prices<00:03:26.390> that<00:03:26.540> I<00:03:26.600> saw<00:03:26.930> and<00:03:27.230> so

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
least at the prices that I saw and so

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.030 
least at the prices that I saw and so
I'm<00:03:28.130> not<00:03:28.489> sure<00:03:28.550> why<00:03:29.209> you<00:03:30.080> would<00:03:30.110> choose<00:03:30.590> the

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
I'm not sure why you would choose the

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.780 
I'm not sure why you would choose the
hyal

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
hyal

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.820 
hyal
unless<00:03:32.450> you're<00:03:32.660> hearing<00:03:33.019> hearing<00:03:33.470> something

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830

that<00:03:33.980> I<00:03:34.130> don't<00:03:34.250> I<00:03:34.670> just<00:03:35.150> think<00:03:35.330> the<00:03:35.420> road

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
that I don't I just think the road

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.470 
that I don't I just think the road
procaster<00:03:36.110> is<00:03:36.350> a<00:03:36.380> better<00:03:36.620> deal<00:03:36.860> I<00:03:37.239> like<00:03:38.239> the

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
procaster is a better deal I like the

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.440 
procaster is a better deal I like the
feel<00:03:39.350> of<00:03:39.380> the<00:03:39.799> road<00:03:39.920> pro-castro<00:03:40.489> is<00:03:40.880> just<00:03:41.150> big

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
feel of the road pro-castro is just big

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.210 
feel of the road pro-castro is just big
and<00:03:41.480> thick<00:03:42.170> and<00:03:42.440> cold<00:03:43.400> steel<00:03:44.530> the<00:03:45.530> hiles<00:03:45.860> also

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
and thick and cold steel the hiles also

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.980 
and thick and cold steel the hiles also
very<00:03:46.430> nice<00:03:46.670> build<00:03:47.090> quality<00:03:47.330> I<00:03:47.510> mean<00:03:47.690> it's<00:03:47.870> a

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:47.990 
very nice build quality I mean it's a

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:49.690 
very nice build quality I mean it's a
beautiful<00:03:48.170> microphone<00:03:48.980> I<00:03:49.160> just

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
beautiful microphone I just

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.550 
beautiful microphone I just
and<00:03:49.849> to<00:03:49.940> prefer<00:03:50.330> the<00:03:50.900> look<00:03:51.110> of<00:03:51.230> the<00:03:51.380> road<00:03:51.530> a

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
little bit more in the feel of it

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.540 
little bit more in the feel of it
they're<00:03:54.110> both<00:03:54.260> really<00:03:54.530> nice<00:03:54.770> microphones<00:03:55.310> you
