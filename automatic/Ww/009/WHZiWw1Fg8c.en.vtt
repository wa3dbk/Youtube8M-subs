00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.799
 as one the solidarity stores are 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:11.900
 vital in the association 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:13.760
 being since they were created are vital 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.709
 on the one hand because they are a window to 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.810
 world to that world that does not know the skin 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:19.250
 of a butterfly when treating a disease 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.170
 rare, most of the 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.240
 people do not know the disease and 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.949
 when they know her sometimes they feel that 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.869
 They want to help but do not know how and 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:29.119
 solidarity shop is the perfect place 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.519
 where being able to help can not help 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.500
 donating time can not help donating 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:35.270
 the things that you no longer need at home one 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.610
 can help talking about the skin of 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.140
 butterfly and obviously being a client 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.550
 then in the solidarity shop they give 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.510
 I find all those people who 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.730
 they want to collaborate with the skin of 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.649
 butterfly do not know how we 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.260
 we welcome and nothing more valuable 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:52.180
 for me that the time to devote the 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:55.120
 time something and at a point of love because 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:58.010
 I suppose it will be merit of all but 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.600
 there is a beautiful environment or super 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.000
 diverse because we are all super 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.469
 different and we bring things very 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.110
 different but clear with all the 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.580
 wealth that you get is a store with 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.860
 Magic 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.920
 as we say we sometimes say with vÃ©lez 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:16.160
 It is a store with a heart because it is not 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.380
 a worker and customer store is 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.660
 a store that we are the whole family one 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.970
 and it's in the store is great for the 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.340
 people are fine because they do not just come to 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.860
 buy that buy buy and like 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.340
 much what they see genre but above all 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.890
 come I think that to feel at ease is 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.660
 as a place and where to go and feel 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.040
 a little bit at home and sometimes they ask you 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.870
 what is your profile to work here 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.670
 to work skin relationships 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.360
 butterfly does not exist and I love it 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.040
 in madrid we have a mom 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.730
 a girl with skin butterfly 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:52.090
 called nativity creme they got involved the 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.830
 cause in all possible ways today 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.260
 in day is one of those responsible for 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.230
 our solidarity stores and it's a 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.150
 person that day to day transmits to all 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.070
 the people around you all 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.479
 people community and society the 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.479
 importance of knowing the skin of 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.820
 butterfly how much you can suppose giving 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.620
 very little of the store for example 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.659
 you find volunteers who 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.519
 that to see that I in him in my case I 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.750
 I take on a personal level that really is 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:21.409

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.769
 which is very hard but they seem 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.000
 wonderful their families because 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:35.460

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.400
 explain there is not a word is that it has 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.520
 that knowing parents arises love 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:51.390
 love comes out abundantly is that the 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.250
 children also have another meaning yes yes 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.290

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.640
 because I tell him I do not even say ayling but 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.450
 the children have 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.730
 a smile that is something else called me at 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.710
 eternal quejo martÃ­n I have skin of 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:09.530
 butterfly and I am 8 years old 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:14.270
 The butterfly skin shop is a 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:17.720
 lots of clothes and two things to give the 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:21.140
 people who do not use so I can 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.630
 buy or that affects so that we are 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.700
 can get sick as soon as possible 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.710
 For me, the skin disease of 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.630
 butterfly in particular the children that I have 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:33.090
 known the complete of butterflies are 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:37.490
 an example of life a lesson of life and 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:40.580
 above all they give me a deep sense of 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:43.350
 what I do here in stores since 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.300
 is what I am doing what is it that 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.100
 I'm dedicating my time and it gives me a lot 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.510
 motivation to continue to click on 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.400
 contribution to move forward with 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.820
 these projects and then they children 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.020
 they are a second pass because outside 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.300
 They are so fragile but also by 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.750
 in so strong as long as they give 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:03.630
 and its energy so that this small 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.950
 project come out ahead and this is to me 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.670
 it gives me a lesson in life every day 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:12.430
 apart from ordering the store and 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.190
 Sort clothes help us understand 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.019
 the world in a different way 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.060
 and that's cool 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:22.410
 what it takes to volunteer is 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.509
 have a big heart and have all 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.720
 the days a smile on the face so that 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:30.210
 those children about those people follow 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.490
 forward has been a way of 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.830
 raise funds for the association that 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.629
 has been vital when hiring 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.759
 staff specialized in the disease 

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:40.530
 as are the nurses the worker 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:42.569
 social and the psychologist who are the ones 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.360
 they really give that direct support and 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:46.949
 continued to the families therefore the 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.229
 solidarity stores for us are the 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:51.300
 life with the way we communicate with the 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:53.610
 world and the way the world of 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.620

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.599
 that families receive what we 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.060
 we want to achieve we can not do it 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:03.030
 alone we need the help of all the 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.190
 society that's why we say your help 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.920

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.470
 Finnish 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:13.460
 is what is to help families to the 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:15.290

 it's something that I notice a lot 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.190
 I changed
