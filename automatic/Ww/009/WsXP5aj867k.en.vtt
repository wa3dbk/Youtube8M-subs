00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
shape and I just love it because I can

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.630 
shape and I just love it because I can
drive<00:03:00.360> and<00:03:00.540> I<00:03:00.600> can<00:03:00.780> see<00:03:01.050> and<00:03:01.470> it's<00:03:02.430> just

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
drive and I can see and it's just

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.010 
drive and I can see and it's just
wonderful<00:03:02.850> and<00:03:03.090> it's<00:03:03.240> kind<00:03:03.510> of<00:03:03.540> like<00:03:03.720> a<00:03:03.750> little

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
wonderful and it's kind of like a little

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.010 
wonderful and it's kind of like a little
gradient<00:03:04.350> so<00:03:04.950> it's<00:03:05.250> easy<00:03:05.790> for<00:03:06.090> me<00:03:06.300> to<00:03:06.330> drive<00:03:06.780> in

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
gradient so it's easy for me to drive in

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.990 
gradient so it's easy for me to drive in
because<00:03:07.350> I<00:03:07.590> feel<00:03:08.220> like<00:03:08.370> I<00:03:08.490> might<00:03:08.700> not<00:03:08.850> be<00:03:08.940> able

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
because I feel like I might not be able

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.400 
because I feel like I might not be able
to<00:03:09.090> drive<00:03:09.330> if<00:03:09.510> they<00:03:09.600> were<00:03:09.690> completely<00:03:10.050> blacked

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
to drive if they were completely blacked

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.220 
to drive if they were completely blacked
out<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:11.330> just<00:03:12.330> I<00:03:12.450> feel<00:03:12.570> like<00:03:12.630> I'd<00:03:12.840> be<00:03:12.870> harder

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
out and just I feel like I'd be harder

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.050 
out and just I feel like I'd be harder
to<00:03:13.260> see<00:03:13.590> you<00:03:13.620> or<00:03:13.830> I<00:03:13.860> would<00:03:13.980> be<00:03:14.010> too<00:03:14.280> dark<00:03:14.490> but

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
to see you or I would be too dark but

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.370 
to see you or I would be too dark but
the<00:03:15.270> fact<00:03:15.450> that<00:03:15.510> they<00:03:15.630> have<00:03:15.750> a<00:03:15.780> gradient<00:03:16.080> is

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
the fact that they have a gradient is

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.500 
the fact that they have a gradient is
nice<00:03:16.590> but<00:03:16.980> at<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.580> same<00:03:17.730> time<00:03:17.910> I<00:03:18.090> don't<00:03:18.300> like

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
nice but at the same time I don't like

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.790 
nice but at the same time I don't like
it<00:03:18.660> because<00:03:18.870> you<00:03:18.959> can<00:03:18.989> kind<00:03:19.230> of<00:03:19.320> see<00:03:19.440> my<00:03:19.470> eyes

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
it because you can kind of see my eyes

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.440 
it because you can kind of see my eyes

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:43.700 
annoying but it kind of goes in a sense

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.060 
annoying but it kind of goes in a sense
that<00:06:43.940> I'm<00:06:44.870> kind<00:06:45.200> of<00:06:45.230> glad<00:06:45.380> this<00:06:45.620> has<00:06:45.770> happened

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.070 
that I'm kind of glad this has happened

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.700 
that I'm kind of glad this has happened
because<00:06:46.160> I'm<00:06:46.400> really<00:06:46.670> OCD<00:06:47.110> in<00:06:48.110> some<00:06:48.440> things

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:48.710 
because I'm really OCD in some things

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.750 
because I'm really OCD in some things
and<00:06:49.510> I<00:06:50.510> think<00:06:51.320> this<00:06:51.590> just<00:06:51.620> makes<00:06:52.100> it<00:06:52.280> feel<00:06:52.490> like

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:52.760 
and I think this just makes it feel like

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.150 
and I think this just makes it feel like
I've<00:06:52.970> worn<00:06:53.240> it<00:06:53.540> if<00:06:54.260> that<00:06:54.470> makes<00:06:54.680> sense<00:06:54.740> rather

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:55.160 
I've worn it if that makes sense rather

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.390 
I've worn it if that makes sense rather
than<00:06:55.540> being<00:06:56.540> one<00:06:56.750> who<00:06:56.900> didn't<00:06:57.350> make<00:06:57.830> use<00:06:58.130> of<00:06:58.250> it

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 
than being one who didn't make use of it

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.620 
than being one who didn't make use of it
I<00:06:58.430> mean<00:06:58.580> this<00:06:58.700> is<00:06:58.820> just<00:06:58.850> life<00:06:59.240> things<00:06:59.480> are

00:06:59.620 --> 00:06:59.630 
I mean this is just life things are

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.420 
I mean this is just life things are
