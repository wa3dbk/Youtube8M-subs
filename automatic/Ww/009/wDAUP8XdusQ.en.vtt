with iPad tuned we've made advances in

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
compromising the iPad size and weight so

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.539 
compromising the iPad size and weight so
rather<00:01:40.600> than<00:01:40.869> developing<00:01:41.200> a<00:01:41.799> separate<00:01:42.310> case

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
rather than developing a separate case

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:45.629 
rather than developing a separate case
we<00:01:43.299> created<00:01:43.810> a<00:01:43.899> cover<00:01:44.229> at<00:01:44.560> the<00:01:44.740> same<00:01:45.069> time<00:01:45.340> that

00:01:45.629 --> 00:01:45.639 
we created a cover at the same time that

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:47.789 
we created a cover at the same time that
we<00:01:45.729> were<00:01:45.850> actually<00:01:45.909> designing<00:01:46.630> the<00:01:46.869> iPad<00:01:47.229> the

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
we were actually designing the iPad the

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:49.919 
we were actually designing the iPad the
two<00:01:47.979> are<00:01:48.100> made<00:01:48.310> to<00:01:48.579> work<00:01:48.759> together<00:01:48.969> it

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929 
two are made to work together it

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:52.139 
two are made to work together it
attaches<00:01:50.229> magnetically<00:01:50.729> aligned<00:01:51.729> perfectly

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
attaches magnetically aligned perfectly

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.809 
attaches magnetically aligned perfectly
and<00:01:52.810> it's<00:01:53.109> just<00:01:53.200> as<00:01:53.530> easy<00:01:53.649> to<00:01:53.799> remove<00:01:54.130> when<00:01:54.700> the

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:54.819 
and it's just as easy to remove when the

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:57.059 
and it's just as easy to remove when the
iPad<00:01:55.149> detects<00:01:55.780> you<00:01:55.959> open<00:01:56.319> the<00:01:56.409> cover<00:01:56.649> it

00:01:57.059 --> 00:01:57.069 
iPad detects you open the cover it

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:59.129 
iPad detects you open the cover it
immediately<00:01:57.639> wakes<00:01:58.060> from<00:01:58.179> sleep<00:01:58.359> and<00:01:58.840> when

00:01:59.129 --> 00:01:59.139 
immediately wakes from sleep and when

00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:00.899 
immediately wakes from sleep and when
you<00:01:59.170> close<00:01:59.469> the<00:01:59.649> cover<00:01:59.859> it<00:02:00.189> could<00:02:00.399> see<00:02:00.520> back<00:02:00.729> to

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
you close the cover it could see back to

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:02.940

nine times faster you'll really notice

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.080 
nine times faster you'll really notice
this<00:04:50.770> in<00:04:50.980> games<00:04:51.280> and

that use a lot of video and for the
first<00:04:54.550> time<00:04:54.730> we've<00:04:55.300> built<00:04:55.510> a<00:04:55.630> gyro<00:04:56.080> into<00:04:56.380> this

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530

I think that I peg tube will really

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:48.250 
I think that I peg tube will really
define<00:05:42.620> that<00:05:42.800> category<00:05:43.370> for<00:05:43.669> years<00:05:43.909> to<00:05:44.000> come
