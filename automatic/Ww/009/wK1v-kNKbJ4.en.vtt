tailgate down and just sit on it and
it's<00:00:41.700> also<00:00:41.850> good<00:00:42.120> for<00:00:42.149> hauling<00:00:42.420> things<00:00:42.690> if<00:00:43.050> you

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
and stuff in it it's definitely been

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.090

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
not really sure why but I think it was

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.380

custom<00:00:52.350> made<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.649> house<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.160> gas<00:00:53.340> tanks<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.940> need

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:03.020 
the best ten dollars I've ever spent
because<00:03:00.660> like<00:03:00.840> I<00:03:01.250> don't<00:03:02.250> like<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.459> radio<00:03:02.760> and

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
because like I don't like the radio and

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.460 
because like I don't like the radio and
then<00:03:03.209> in<00:03:03.450> here<00:03:03.989> is<00:03:04.819> the<00:03:05.989> charger<00:03:06.989> thing<00:03:07.170> I

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
then in here is the charger thing I

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.319 
then in here is the charger thing I
guess<00:03:08.310> it<00:03:08.609> used<00:03:08.790> to<00:03:08.879> be<00:03:08.940> like<00:03:09.090> a<00:03:09.120> cigarette

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
guess it used to be like a cigarette

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.119 
guess it used to be like a cigarette
lighter<00:03:09.690> so<00:03:10.230> you<00:03:10.319> could<00:03:10.440> stick<00:03:10.680> that<00:03:10.709> in<00:03:11.010> there

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
lighter so you could stick that in there

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.190 
lighter so you could stick that in there
but<00:03:11.700> it<00:03:11.849> doesn't<00:03:12.090> work<00:03:12.239> cuz<00:03:12.629> this<00:03:12.750> is<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:12.900> really

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200
