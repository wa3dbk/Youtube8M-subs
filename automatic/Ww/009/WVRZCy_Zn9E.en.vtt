now let's work on totem pole be so

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.539 
now let's work on totem pole be so
there's<00:03:01.430> only<00:03:01.610> two<00:03:01.910> more<00:03:02.120> houses<00:03:02.299> remaining

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:20.700 

I<00:03:11.720> think<00:03:12.720> it<00:03:12.900> goes<00:03:13.050> up<00:03:13.290> here<00:03:13.700> and<00:03:16.940> Zappos<00:03:17.940> house

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:31.070 
I think that should be a hundred percent
Oh<00:03:23.170> No<00:03:28.350> okay<00:03:29.350> i<00:03:29.380> think<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:30.040> other<00:03:30.070> way<00:03:30.490> around

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
Oh No okay i think the other way around

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:40.290 
Oh No okay i think the other way around
if<00:03:32.080> i'm<00:03:32.230> correct<00:03:38.190> yep<00:03:39.190> there<00:03:39.760> you<00:03:39.790> go<00:03:39.940> one

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
if i'm correct yep there you go one

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.730 
if i'm correct yep there you go one
hundred<00:03:40.600> percent<00:03:42.180> so<00:03:43.180> don't<00:03:43.660> forget<00:03:43.960> that<00:03:44.200> for

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740
