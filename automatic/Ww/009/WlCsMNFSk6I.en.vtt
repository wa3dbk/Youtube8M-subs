 Hamburg 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.940
 one or the other position will be in 2010 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:16.689
 we just have 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:20.980
 around which window Philipp Scholz the other variant of ICQ 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:26.429
 the two also documents can for the Mac and 2-win youth violence and 4 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:28.509
 around 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:30.589
 Of course you have to say so 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:33.870
 The application works with me somehow Thorstens again 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:34.870
 feasted 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.030
 to get them there the ugly one-stop percent 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.210
 yes, I can not synonymous error but this one 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.550
 this program the etching 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.610
 the 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.090
 Doha dpa - 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.510
 simply no trace 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.720
 I do not know 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.160
 percent is a fantastic program with a buzzing greenhorn 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.540
 here what you pull down here too 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.920
 Adium 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.260
 Blatter picked up from the platypus 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.470
 is definitely a fantastic program you see it already 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.780
 very nice 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.580
 shown around as there is a loss of one of this unit to me 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.259
 pretty 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:15.680
 also a radio 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.660
 Nations also still Altenbergen plenty of appropriate Joe supports 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.510
 Percent and everyone can tell us slowly Year really blatantly yes too 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.700
 in the near future 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.700
 Googles head hair percent 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.780
 contact him 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.479
 you see her getting a picture of Sigrid getting along the fantastic 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.280
 Master that is really succeeded 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.700
 Just showed up someone who interests me here so 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.660
 but also to partner here, the app brings nothing, no ICQ only needs 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.590
 get in now 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.390
 Unfortunately, you get here just before you like that at the 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.120
 Windows version Murder call Windows XP Vista and Windows 7 and so on 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.420
 at the three points 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.580
 5 version of ICQ 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.820
 Percent that does not complain much by law it's not like that either 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.910
 inevitably what you want to have, of course there are additional programs you can 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.250
 also on the second partition online so you really go 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.269
 want to have a program 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.799
 to support the ICQ where you can 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:15.219
 can make phone calls and audio can lead conversations and such 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:16.519
 then that's it 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.760
 there are no programs I say so much possible 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.449
 People who take him away 

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:22.989
 Invite dogs 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.989
 You see how beautiful you are here yourself 

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:29.579
 Gunther Maassen slight complaints 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:34.289
 Fluffy no one comes online or lavishly disposed of every case 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.959
 highly recommended Mio 

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:49.209
 Years of diversity when Peter knows I hope there is a fear there is 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.829
 Afghanistan now EUR million 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:55.229
 the stage collected the poem of classic designs 

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:56.099
 to the 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.069
 it looks slim and rank 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.339
 it is we have free and that is just right kenya so that 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:07.489
 around the ICQ often - and still gladly freed out cusses always so tools 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:08.069
 is 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.449
 with which one can endanger the currency 

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:13.449
 then you do not need the same ad-free now and I think 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.269
 it is really well done by this 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.469
 the Mutzen accounted for 

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:22.469
 around I can here maybe a few functions one has then also the 

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:24.949
 or 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:27.089
 Of course it's not like that 

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:30.089
 mature though 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.909
 Of course, he must now someone from Skype also in Skype app, of course, too 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:38.840
 Skype also gives it for Mac has always looks but also bad 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.339
 Find as baptized 

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:44.989
 Percent - but it has pretty much all the functions 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.149
 the windows version also has 

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:52.149
 Altium is 

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:56.559
 The class it is the opposite world apart from the world 

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:57.769
 seen everything 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.369
 fantastic 

00:03:59.369 --> 00:04:01.459
 So it will be online too 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:02.649
 duration 

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:05.839
 then up or down it played quite fantastic 

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:10.189
 just to recommend to participate I have subscribed Antonietti but I like 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:11.289
 I think i 

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:14.649
 the videos have fallen 

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:17.759
 and percent on a nice 2010 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:21.229
 here a lot of low loaders allow my mistake to end 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.879
 nice that you are still there 

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:27.629
 and Gerlach also video answers to programs 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.110
 So all the people give the conti-speaker to do 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.210
 I often ask 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.460
 very nice and nice 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.669
 You're welcome 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.559
 since he is beautiful after the video response 

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:42.879
 free programs for the Mac which are really useful 

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:46.629
 make it even hotter under the Mac 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:49.099
 also not good 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:52.099
 Not 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:55.550
 Well
