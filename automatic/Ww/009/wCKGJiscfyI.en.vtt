00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.839
 Today I am going to tell you my experience of 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.719
 how I have had my hair a color 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.820
 I 've already washed my cake several times 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.700
 that has been removed is not the color that 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.440
 I stayed but good happens less I'm going to 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.420
 tell the two steps I 've done and 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.580
 I will show clips of how the 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.039
 hair behind each step first I want to 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.199
 say that I am not a hairdresser nor do I have 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.230
 no idea of ​​hair like this I'm that I've 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.810
 loaded my hair but had tried in 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.520
 the advice the best advice not in 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.219
 plan that is not what I have done 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.750
 because you are going to load your hair try 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.239
 do less discolorations than I do 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.129
 I have done and everything will go better 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.500
 The first thing you have to do is 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.260
 discolor the hair more obviously to 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.210
 any pastel tone or fantasy tone 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.559
 It depends on what you want if you want 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.680
 put on a pastel tone has to 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.390
 stay white or almost white hair and 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.980
 if you want a very strong fantasy tone 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.000
 Well, maybe with a little 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.540
 amarillito or vale I have used 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.980
 this is blue powder dye 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.560
 mixed with that peroxide cream the 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.810
 peroxide cream that I used is 9% 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.880
 or 30 volumes and for my hair tone 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.620
 that more or less dark brown more or 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.050
 less like my eyebrows you have to mix 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.090
 the same amount of cream powder I 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.700
 I used the 30 but it is much more 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.800
 advisable to use the 20 because it makes 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.890
 less damage to hair but I'm like that 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:29.280
 fruit and how my hair matters to me well 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.460
 little since I used the 30 yo color 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.530
 in my hair four times is the worst 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.660
 you can do in life because I've been 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.310
 my super dry hair is falling 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:43.950
 now you look at it and it falls and it's fatal 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.100
 but hey I wanted to get the color 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.160
 super fast cake and what color that 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.950
 often it is the least advisable that 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.049
 you can forgive 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.080
 there with your decision do not do it 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.060
 at home gentlemen 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.250
 to discolor hair once 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.390
 you have made the mixture of parts 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.950
 you have to start and continue 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.619
 these steps because after the 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.450
 experience of having started the other way around 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:15.010
 I understand why you have to leave two 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:18.850
 or three fingers of root and apply the mixture 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:22.300
 of decolourising those three fingers towards 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.880
 down towards the tips like this all over the 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.750
 hair and when you have finished you leave it 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:31.750
 rest 15 minutes 20 and you throw in the 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:36.160
 roots when you have it the root let 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:39.760
 all hair another 20 30 minutes 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.550
 and the vice is already repeating the process 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.110
 declare the times you wish it is missing 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.620
 that you get the white tone that makes 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.360
 missing for the pastel tone wait three 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.090
 four weeks between statements of 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.970
 coloration because if not the hair will 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.830
 dehydrates a lot to exercise I 'm 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.560
 super dry is a scourer of the same mi 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.570
 This is a clip of how I had the 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.910
 hair after the first discoloration that 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.070
 I did it wrong I started with the root so 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.680
 my head burned after a few minutes and 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.380
 ends the whole head and I had to 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.480
 remove super fast bleaching as well 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.850
 that I stayed this support orange tone 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.110
 ugly and after the second chlorination 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:21.300
 I had my hair like that 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.810
 I 'm a little more white but 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:28.020
 I was still yellow and I made a third 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.090
 discoloration and I stayed the palace and 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.670
 I recommend after each discoloration 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.950
 they use the nuance before I did not buy it 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.750
 this third discoloration for the 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.890
 technical because I did not have to try more 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.270
 sometimes the system of operating it serves 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.100
 the real 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.830
 there are much cheaper brands try 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.360
 buy the white label is that in 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.000
 Spain on the market there is more 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:54.180
 cheap is simply a shampoo with 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.120
 purple tones of hue before and in cáceres 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:00.300
 that that tea of ​​the hair passes first 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.730
 silvery white tone and then it happens to 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.830
 purple depends on how long you leave it 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.310
 me after the second and the third 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:12.180
 discoloration I left it like an hour or 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:14.010
 thing like that a lot the truth but like 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.840
 in the end I decided to put on my purple hair 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.609
 I did not care if there was a reflector 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.980
 purple leaves you so long the nuance 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.840
 before using this from the first 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.710
 statement will be much easier 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.360
 get the white tone 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.260
 once they have the hair in tone 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.360
 white white you can already pass 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.970
 of books the hair of the color that you want 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.970
 I gave them the violet tone of right in 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:41.230
 colors and mix it with a lot of 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:43.210
 conditioner and a little bit of the dye 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.190
 these dyes are semi permanent not 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.660
 they damage the hair and as it mixes it 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.150
 with a lot of conditioner and 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.160
 moisturizes the hair made conditioner 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.620
 if you want a pastel tone if you want a 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.110
 Fantasy tone that is super purple no 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.930
 you use the conditioner to throw 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:02.780
 directly the dye on our hair 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:07.250
 to let act one 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:09.710

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:12.020
