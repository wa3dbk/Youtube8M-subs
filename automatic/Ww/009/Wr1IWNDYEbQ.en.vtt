from<00:01:49.680> crane<00:01:49.979> cable<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.460> core<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.880> 1095<00:01:51.420> was<00:01:51.930> used

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
from crane cable a core of 1095 was used

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.230 
from crane cable a core of 1095 was used
for<00:01:52.560> added<00:01:52.950> edge<00:01:53.130> holding<00:01:53.640> with<00:01:53.759> bandsaw

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
for added edge holding with bandsaw

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.149 
for added edge holding with bandsaw
steel<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:55.229> was<00:01:55.380> forged<00:01:55.740> out<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.070> then

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
steel it was forged out and then

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.709 
steel it was forged out and then
annealed<00:01:56.430> next<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.850> blade<00:01:57.030> was<00:01:57.270> ground<00:01:57.570> the

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
annealed next the blade was ground the

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.300 
annealed next the blade was ground the
shape<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.140> take<00:01:58.290> advantage<00:01:58.740> of<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.950> pattern

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
shape to take advantage of the pattern

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.280 
shape to take advantage of the pattern
it<00:01:59.430> was<00:01:59.520> then<00:01:59.640> heat<00:01:59.909> tempered<00:02:00.450> quenched<00:02:01.170> in

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
it was then heat tempered quenched in

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.069 
it was then heat tempered quenched in
oil<00:02:01.409> hardened<00:02:02.070> by<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.670> tempering<00:02:03.540> cycle<00:02:03.990> the

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
oil hardened by a tempering cycle the

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.319 
oil hardened by a tempering cycle the
blade<00:02:04.259> was<00:02:04.409> polished<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.009> etched<00:02:05.310> itching<00:02:06.210> is

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
blade was polished and etched itching is

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.059 
blade was polished and etched itching is
where<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.540> use<00:02:06.689> acid<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.290> bring<00:02:07.590> out<00:02:07.770> those

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
where you use acid to bring out those

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.160 
where you use acid to bring out those
different<00:02:08.580> colors<00:02:08.849> in<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.360> steel<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:09.929> show

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
different colors in the steel and show

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.710 
different colors in the steel and show
the<00:02:10.349> difference<00:02:10.679> in<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.890> patterns<00:02:11.280> then

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
the difference in the patterns then

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.780 
the difference in the patterns then
leaving<00:02:13.080> that<00:02:13.410> pattern<00:02:13.890> handle<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.460> fixtures

leaving that pattern handle and fixtures

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.210 
leaving that pattern handle and fixtures
were<00:02:14.940> applied<00:02:15.300> and<00:02:15.330> finished<00:02:15.990> out<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.470> custom
