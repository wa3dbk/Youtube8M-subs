00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
maybe help speed up that process first

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.240 
maybe help speed up that process first
thing<00:00:31.279> try<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.340> make<00:00:32.520> sure<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.850> your<00:00:33.030> bow<00:00:33.239> is

this when you're going across the

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.549 
this when you're going across the
strings<00:00:40.260> try<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:40.980> keep<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.280> parallel<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:42.559> the

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
strings try to keep it parallel to the

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.580 
strings try to keep it parallel to the
bridge<00:00:43.800> in<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.489> fingerboard<00:00:45.350> just<00:00:46.350> going

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
bridge in the fingerboard just going

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.660 
bridge in the fingerboard just going
straight<00:00:46.710> up<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.100> down<00:00:47.219> okay

you don't want any of this when you're
going<00:00:49.680> across<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.980> strings<00:00:50.570> another<00:00:51.570> thing

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
going across the strings another thing

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.430 
going across the strings another thing
is<00:00:53.030> you<00:00:54.030> don't<00:00:54.180> want<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.420> be<00:00:54.510> too<00:00:54.719> close<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:55.289> the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
is you don't want to be too close to the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.349 
is you don't want to be too close to the
bridge<00:00:55.649> okay<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:57.320> lot<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.879> if<00:00:59.879> you<00:01:00.030> are<00:01:00.180> too

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
bridge okay a lot of that if you are too

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.400 
bridge okay a lot of that if you are too
close<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.719> bridge<00:01:00.870> maybe<00:01:01.170> you're

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
close to the bridge maybe you're

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.630 
close to the bridge maybe you're
pressing<00:01:01.680> too<00:01:02.070> hard

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
pressing too hard

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.820 
pressing too hard
maybe<00:01:02.940> not<00:01:03.149> hard<00:01:03.420> enough<00:01:03.619> one<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.710> those

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
maybe not hard enough one of those

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.510 
maybe not hard enough one of those
things<00:01:05.270> maybe<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.420> are<00:01:06.869> too<00:01:07.500> close<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.400> the

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
things maybe you are too close to the

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.969 
things maybe you are too close to the
fingerboard<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.180> also<00:01:09.630> not<00:01:10.380> pressing<00:01:10.799> too

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
fingerboard and also not pressing too

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.289 
fingerboard and also not pressing too
hard<00:01:11.189> or<00:01:12.290> too<00:01:13.290> soft<00:01:14.220> or<00:01:14.549> one<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.030> those<00:01:15.119> other

things<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:16.220> though<00:01:17.220> there<00:01:17.400> does<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.549> couple

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
things so though there does a couple

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.510 
things so though there does a couple
things<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.299> keep<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:18.750> mind<00:01:18.979> once<00:01:19.979> again<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.400> lot

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
things to keep in mind once again a lot

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.460 
things to keep in mind once again a lot
of<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:20.880> going<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.119> come<00:01:21.270> with<00:01:21.990> practice

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
of it is going to come with practice

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.950 
of it is going to come with practice
just<00:01:22.710> naturally<00:01:23.369> as<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:24.299> play<00:01:24.720> through

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
just naturally as you play through

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.300 
just naturally as you play through
different<00:01:25.290> songs<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.830> get<00:01:25.890> better<00:01:26.100> you're

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
different songs and get better you're

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.490 
different songs and get better you're
gonna<00:01:26.520> naturally<00:01:26.759> learn<00:01:27.119> how<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.360> not<00:01:28.200> squeak

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
gonna naturally learn how to not squeak

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.289 
gonna naturally learn how to not squeak
but<00:01:29.220> like<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.430> said<00:01:29.610> it's<00:01:29.759> perfectly<00:01:30.090> natural

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
but like I said it's perfectly natural

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.060 
but like I said it's perfectly natural
but<00:01:31.200> just<00:01:31.380> try<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.590> avoid<00:01:32.720> going

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
but just try to avoid going

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.180 
but just try to avoid going
exeunt<00:01:35.140> like<00:01:36.140> that<00:01:36.320> when<00:01:36.500> you<00:01:36.590> go<00:01:36.740> across<00:01:36.920> the

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
exeunt like that when you go across the

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.340 
exeunt like that when you go across the
strings<00:01:37.510> playing<00:01:38.510> too<00:01:38.720> close<00:01:38.960> to<00:01:39.080> the<00:01:39.170> bridge

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
strings playing too close to the bridge

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.750 
strings playing too close to the bridge
or<00:01:39.740> too<00:01:40.520> close<00:01:40.760> to<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:41.480> fingerboard<00:01:41.750> and

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
or too close to the fingerboard and

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.950 
or too close to the fingerboard and
experiment<00:01:43.760> with<00:01:43.970> how<00:01:44.180> hard<00:01:44.720> you're<00:01:44.900> gonna

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
experiment with how hard you're gonna

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.500 
experiment with how hard you're gonna
push<00:01:45.260> obviously<00:01:45.800> if<00:01:45.860> you<00:01:45.920> go<00:01:46.070> and<00:01:47.060> that's<00:01:47.240> too

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
push obviously if you go and that's too

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.450 
push obviously if you go and that's too
hard<00:01:48.790> okay<00:01:49.790> that's<00:01:50.030> a<00:01:50.060> little<00:01:50.210> too<00:01:50.360> soft

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
hard okay that's a little too soft

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.800 
hard okay that's a little too soft
pretty<00:01:52.460> much<00:01:52.610> just<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:53.030> weight<00:01:53.240> of<00:01:53.479> the<00:01:53.600> bow

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
pretty much just the weight of the bow

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.620 
pretty much just the weight of the bow
in<00:01:54.140> the<00:01:54.979> middle<00:01:55.010> of<00:01:55.790> the<00:01:56.030> finger<00:01:56.300> of<00:01:56.540> the

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
in the middle of the finger of the

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.550
