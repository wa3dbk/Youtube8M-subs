00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
as you can see like I said it is very

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.910 
as you can see like I said it is very
muddy<00:00:35.940> on<00:00:36.239> this<00:00:36.480> end<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.840> field<00:00:37.079> I'm<00:00:37.770> not

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
muddy on this end of the field I'm not

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.950 
muddy on this end of the field I'm not
exactly<00:00:38.190> sure<00:00:38.370> why<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.390> whole<00:00:39.570> field<00:00:39.809> is

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
exactly sure why is the whole field is

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.250 
exactly sure why is the whole field is
kind<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.290> up<00:00:40.440> on<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:41.219> hill<00:00:41.550> but<00:00:42.079> there's<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.140> lot

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
kind of up on a hill but there's a lot

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.290 
kind of up on a hill but there's a lot
of<00:00:43.379> clay<00:00:43.559> content<00:00:43.829> my<00:00:44.219> soil<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:44.969> spring

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
of clay content my soil and it is spring

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.590 
of clay content my soil and it is spring
so<00:00:45.660> it's<00:00:46.440> gotten<00:00:46.770> pretty<00:00:46.980> bad<00:00:47.180> and<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.360> leads

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
so it's gotten pretty bad and that leads

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.299 
so it's gotten pretty bad and that leads
you<00:00:48.750> down<00:00:48.809> into<00:00:49.200> this<00:00:49.379> back<00:00:49.620> stretch<00:00:49.980> here

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
the chicane this section is actually

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.679 
the chicane this section is actually
pretty<00:01:05.400> rough<00:01:05.670> through<00:01:05.909> here<00:01:06.150> there's<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.570> lot

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
pretty rough through here there's a lot

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.899 
pretty rough through here there's a lot
of<00:01:06.840> ruts<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.560> have<00:01:07.710> been<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.250> my<00:01:08.280> field<00:01:08.640> for

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.969 
of ruts that have been in my field for
years<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.540> like<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.260> said<00:01:10.320> this<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.740> really

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
years and like I said this is really

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.320 
years and like I said this is really
heavy<00:01:11.130> clay<00:01:11.430> content<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.150> gets<00:01:12.270> pretty

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
heavy clay content so it gets pretty

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.510 
heavy clay content so it gets pretty
bouncy<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.930> these<00:01:13.080> areas<00:01:13.409> I'm<00:01:14.070> trying<00:01:14.340> my<00:01:14.490> best
