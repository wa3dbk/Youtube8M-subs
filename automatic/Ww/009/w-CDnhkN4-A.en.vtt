00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
hanging up there most likely it's going

the week you put it on a hanger most

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.139 
the week you put it on a hanger most
likely<00:01:58.469> unless<00:01:58.710> your<00:01:58.920> three-year-old<00:01:59.430> gets<00:02:00.030> a

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
likely unless your three-year-old gets a

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.760 
likely unless your three-year-old gets a
hold<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.570> pulls<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:00.960> down<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.110> uses<00:02:01.649> it

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
as a blanket it is going to stay wrinkle

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.999 
as a blanket it is going to stay wrinkle
free<00:02:05.399> so<00:02:05.820> another<00:02:06.509> great<00:02:06.990> reason<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.619> put<00:02:07.920> it

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.270 
points there it doesn't it takes a long
time<00:03:08.540> for<00:03:08.810> that<00:03:09.049> to<00:03:09.170> happen<00:03:09.290> but<00:03:09.590> it<00:03:10.010> can

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
time for that to happen but it can

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.929 
time for that to happen but it can
happen<00:03:11.079> less<00:03:12.079> closet<00:03:12.829> space<00:03:13.099> so<00:03:13.519> not<00:03:13.670> all<00:03:13.909> of

made specifically for shirts and not

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:23.620

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
only do I use it because it's cedar and

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.080

but<00:04:26.990> I<00:04:27.410> also<00:04:27.860> like<00:04:28.130> that<00:04:28.190> it's<00:04:28.490> got<00:04:28.639> a<00:04:28.669> little

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
but I also like that it's got a little

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.700 
but I also like that it's got a little
bit<00:04:28.970> thicker<00:04:29.270> area<00:04:29.810> for<00:04:29.990> the<00:04:30.080> shoulders<00:04:30.500> I

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
bit thicker area for the shoulders I

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.340 
bit thicker area for the shoulders I
also<00:04:31.639> like<00:04:32.060> though<00:04:32.210> it's<00:04:32.449> got<00:04:32.600> the<00:04:32.660> metal<00:04:33.110> hook

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
also like though it's got the metal hook

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.920 
also like though it's got the metal hook
so<00:04:33.980> whenever<00:04:34.190> I'm<00:04:34.460> traveling<00:04:34.760> I<00:04:35.210> actually<00:04:35.750> use

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
so whenever I'm traveling I actually use

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.409 
so whenever I'm traveling I actually use
a<00:04:35.960> garment<00:04:36.470> bag<00:04:36.500> and<00:04:36.889> I<00:04:37.520> can<00:04:37.880> then<00:04:38.000> can<00:04:38.150> take

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
a garment bag and I can then can take

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:40.360 
a garment bag and I can then can take
them<00:04:38.630> and<00:04:38.810> because<00:04:39.380> it's<00:04:39.560> metal<00:04:39.800> up<00:04:40.010> there<00:04:40.190> it

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
them and because it's metal up there it

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.510 
them and because it's metal up there it
doesn't<00:04:41.290> plastic<00:04:42.290> can<00:04:42.440> be<00:04:42.470> kind<00:04:42.710> of<00:04:42.770> bulky<00:04:43.130> but

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
doesn't plastic can be kind of bulky but

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.250 
doesn't plastic can be kind of bulky but
for<00:04:43.699> most<00:04:43.910> men<00:04:44.120> actually<00:04:44.449> plastic<00:04:44.750> hangers
