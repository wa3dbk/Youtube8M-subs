00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.959
 bar won from Spanish 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.540
 you have the following commands for 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:33.010
 to use you that is not a vip you will have the 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:34.030
 coach bar is yoga internet and stay 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.420

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.970

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.250
 before and a revolver ta you will win 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.310
 these items in the neighborhood that unraveled and 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.470
 you also have the bar in the 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:58.959
 coach is not for seller only here 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:03:07.510
 I have a new rock bar kit that this 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:09.040
 new hit is booming emerging is that 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.440
 I 'm dumb, understood, I have to 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.540
 write more but beauty 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.670
 So what I'm going to recommend for 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.640
 You do at the beginning neither you have 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.630
 five why ball if you have a pokémon 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.049
 logically you will have captured a 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.810
 pokémon at first you want at least 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:27.670
 evolving but it's bad because mon pokémon 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.110
 you think following up here but that was 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.760
 very gay scrotum that I did 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:35.560
 So what do you think going on here? 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.510
 forests you will abandon infinite 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.190
 There will be an hour that you will leave the 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.040
 the sporting area and I do not 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.320
 a lot and you will find pokémons 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.680
 random they will not come low level 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:50.890
 of punishment can not even live or know 40 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:56.880
 level 10 and its level 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.880
 I still think because I know my level. 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:03.850
 I find it boring for the 30's 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.920
 so it's going to be a miniseries will be 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.320
 just to stay with your brother and father 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.090
 where I was in Israel from the car I 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:14.079
 I thought this foam pokemon from here 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.700
 and assumed then I walked just a little bit 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:18.370
 Today I met with a piece of shit I'm not going 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:22.000
 battle with it you would like to 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.230
 battle with it, let's go here because 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.330
 we are 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.030
 the boys like it is a shit in him does not give 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:31.750
 damage because they will case your only one 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:34.720
 I remember it and I remember my account because 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.660
 It would not be a very cool thing right then 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.090
 You'll start here by capturing the 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.640
 Pokémon I'm going to cut the video 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:46.050
 part he is with little hp 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:49.150
 Yeah, I think next time he gets 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:51.040
 not down or play Pokemon now not 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.790
 I'm patience, I'm staying five hours. 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:57.130
 here she is half an hour the hard exam and 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:59.830
 this crap is making penetrate this 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.760
 fucking ninja cocoon amount 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.250
 damn it 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:07.510
 then, because it's because there why 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:10.080
 ball spinning there then football because 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.080
 a scrotum 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.550
 Now let's wait for the experience in 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:19.260
 football, because I think it should 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:26.650
 take longer than to take his hp out of it 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:29.380
 in did not work then what is good 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:34.330
 Thrown of options you will not kill the 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:40.120
 team mother I say that he is not 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:42.070
 I want to go out and catch the ball. 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:46.440
 It's not the way it is here. 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.440
 then it will appear here and that is power 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:51.370
 play because it is a totally area the 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:56.800
 should start in two minutes 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:58.900
 and it makes sense then it is and if it threw 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.090
 We are explaining the Cuban women all over 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:04.210
 world know although I think it will not 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:07.210
 I'll explain about evt eee 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:09.760
 if the person does not even know 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.680
 for cable that explains why the 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.910
 person does not even know what a 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.700
 initial pokémon 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:19.600
 So I'll start here at the beginning of the 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:23.890

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:28.030
