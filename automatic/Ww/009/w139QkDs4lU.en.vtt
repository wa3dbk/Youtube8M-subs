00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
hunting in these games but I have a

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.600 
hunting in these games but I have a
problem<00:03:19.930> with<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.590> fact<00:03:20.769> that<00:03:20.860> some<00:03:21.250> methods

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
problem with the fact that some methods

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.630 
problem with the fact that some methods
are<00:03:21.700> just<00:03:21.880> broken<00:03:23.070> mizuna<00:03:24.070> method<00:03:24.370> is<00:03:24.489> much

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
are just broken mizuna method is much

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.640 
are just broken mizuna method is much
easier<00:03:25.090> in<00:03:25.209> this<00:03:25.329> game<00:03:25.570> but<00:03:25.900> it<00:03:26.110> still<00:03:26.410> takes

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
easier in this game but it still takes

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.860 
easier in this game but it still takes
some<00:03:26.829> effort<00:03:27.250> so<00:03:27.610> I'll<00:03:27.730> leave<00:03:27.880> that<00:03:27.940> out<00:03:28.299> it's

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
some effort so I'll leave that out it's

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.840

really<00:03:43.720> something<00:03:44.260> special<00:03:44.340> but<00:03:45.340> something

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
really something special but something

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.039

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:26.039 
interactive with each other which is why

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:27.999 
interactive with each other which is why
he's<00:06:26.310> gained<00:06:26.520> two<00:06:26.669> spots<00:06:26.939> on<00:06:27.090> this<00:06:27.240> list<00:06:27.509> and

he's gained two spots on this list and

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:31.159 
he's gained two spots on this list and
so<00:06:29.009> in<00:06:29.460> my<00:06:29.729> opinion<00:06:29.849> the<00:06:30.539> most<00:06:30.689> annoying

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:31.169 
so in my opinion the most annoying

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:32.839 
so in my opinion the most annoying

00:07:06.619 --> 00:07:06.629 
previously stated that I enjoyed the

00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:08.420 
previously stated that I enjoyed the
references<00:07:07.199> made<00:07:07.409> to<00:07:07.590> the<00:07:07.710> vassal<00:07:08.009> frontier

references made to the vassal frontier

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.700 
references made to the vassal frontier
but<00:07:08.729> it's<00:07:08.909> bittersweet<00:07:09.210> it's<00:07:10.110> nice<00:07:10.379> to<00:07:10.560> see

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:10.710 
but it's bittersweet it's nice to see

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:12.140 
but it's bittersweet it's nice to see
that<00:07:10.740> it's<00:07:11.039> acknowledged<00:07:11.610> in<00:07:11.729> these<00:07:11.879> games

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:12.150 
that it's acknowledged in these games

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.570 
that it's acknowledged in these games
but<00:07:12.779> at<00:07:12.900> the<00:07:13.020> same<00:07:13.199> time<00:07:13.529> it's<00:07:13.949> almost<00:07:14.310> like

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:14.580 
but at the same time it's almost like

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.059 
but at the same time it's almost like
rubbing<00:07:14.849> salt<00:07:14.999> into<00:07:15.479> an<00:07:15.689> open<00:07:15.990> wound<00:07:16.229> there<00:07:16.919> is

rubbing salt into an open wound there is

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:18.589 
rubbing salt into an open wound there is
still<00:07:17.279> hope<00:07:17.310> that<00:07:17.550> the<00:07:17.759> battle<00:07:18.060> frontier<00:07:18.180> may

00:07:18.589 --> 00:07:18.599 
still hope that the battle frontier may

00:07:18.599 --> 00:07:21.079 
still hope that the battle frontier may
be<00:07:18.659> released<00:07:19.139> as<00:07:19.349> DLC<00:07:19.499> at<00:07:19.979> some<00:07:20.189> point<00:07:20.430> but

00:07:21.079 --> 00:07:21.089 
be released as DLC at some point but

00:07:21.089 --> 00:07:23.300 
be released as DLC at some point but
that<00:07:21.360> possibility<00:07:21.629> seems<00:07:22.500> to<00:07:22.740> become<00:07:22.860> less

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:23.310 
that possibility seems to become less

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.119 
that possibility seems to become less
likely<00:07:23.849> as<00:07:23.969> time<00:07:24.270> goes<00:07:24.509> on<00:07:24.659> and<00:07:24.990> so<00:07:25.770> that<00:07:26.039> was

00:07:26.119 --> 00:07:26.129 
likely as time goes on and so that was

00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:27.920 
likely as time goes on and so that was
