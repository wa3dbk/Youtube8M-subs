00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:20.710
 this is my format camera 1824 ago 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:23.730
 It has an interchangeable lens and it is removed 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.730
 and it is placed 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.420
 this machine when I did it did not have 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.910
 reference of a minute machine but 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.670
 what I had seen about 35 years ago 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.720
 back so I did it by heart and it has 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.950
 some defects or faults 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.870
 constructive errors that 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.300
 I would like to detail to avoid that 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.300
 someone the kites better is the way 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.710
 this is my whole camera 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.710
 Argentina 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.780
 of which 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.840
 highlight some details 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.720
 these cameras are after the years 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.470
 20 are not so much Spanish that's a 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.690
 Spanish invention these cameras come from 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:21.440
 of the type ferro cameras 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.390
 all were patented in Great Britain already 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.940
 from there models were made 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.220
 direct positive cameras 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.520
 payment types and there came out these the 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.570
 first European patent that exists of the 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.570
 year 1915 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:42.790
 and there is a very new posterior patient 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:45.610
 pretty from the 20s in the 30s a 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:49.060
 English firm no longer patented its own 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:52.090
 model in the usa there are other patents the 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.560
 Argentine camera does not have this patent 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.630
 we could also say that it is a 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.640
 little documented photograph of origin 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.860
 Argentinian but it would be as false as the 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.470
 76 years old 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.390
 now we are going to devote ourselves to the details 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.180
 interesting that this camera has 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.700
 the containers where the chemical is put if 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.620
 they are fixed in the containers are conical 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.290
 these are not originals are they buy 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.230
 but they help to save a lot much 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:21.080
 liquid 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.080
 they are placed they have a small drawer 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.370
 the liquid 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.310
 and the 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.330
 an interesting detail 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:38.090
 Fixing is also interesting 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.670
 to wash this screw that fixes the bar 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.030
 inside has a candle that makes 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.980
 suddenly 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:49.420
 but here is a washer to do that 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.420
 by pressing and 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.670
 against the male that is here the catch 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:58.620
 press the rod and is trained in 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.620
 position is very practical and fast 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.550
 another interesting detail of this machine 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.240
 which helps the construction of these 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.840
 parallel bars through which slides 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:19.690
 the focusing plate is that they are mounted 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.150
 on an aluminum plate is 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.150
 pierce the two together the one that goes from one 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.150
 side and takes it from the north when drilling the 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:31.659
 together they are always parallel 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:34.140
 it's quite simple to get the car 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:36.240
 with 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.210
 I think those are the two details 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.710
 plus 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.710
 has the machine too 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.300
 the drawer on which he runs is very 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.920
 practical to put and remove liquids 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.750
 they do not require much space 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.530
 I think it's the details that are worth the 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.530
 worth mentioning
