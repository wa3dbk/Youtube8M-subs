00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.469
 very good friends so now we are going to 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.590
 answer the questions of our 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.590
 public 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.080
 ask the doctor comes thanks to 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.800
 this form 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.730
 the doctor embroiders the consultation please 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.240
 as welcome 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.700
 to order question is if the speaker is 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.800
 good to clean wounds 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.910
 I'm going to run into a lot of people with 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.310
 the answer that I am going to tell you 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.950
 it turns out that before in the oxygenated 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:41.250
 it was really used to clean everything 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.590
 type of injuries today it is proven that 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.110
 It is not ideal and I will explain why 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.489
 what has some good effects for 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.379
 clean the wounds have you seen that 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.989
 white foam that comes out when it has 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.019
 contact the water with the blood makes a 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.390
 foam that has an effect like that 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:59.220
 can remove some filthy that is 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.890
 may have been stuck inside the 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:05.850
 hurt but just as it produces those 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.920
 bubbles burns oxygenated water burns and 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.780
 you can try it by placing a 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.640
 little on the finger and they will realize 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.550
 how it looks white and then it goes out with 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.190
 skin and all that dead tissue that 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.680
 burned tissue in the long run later it is 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.300
 seat for some bacteria that are going to 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.399
 contaminate the wounds 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.820
 the ideal lady and here we are going to break 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:30.300
 myths also the ideal is water and soap 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.230
 is the best treatment to clean 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.230
 wounds 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:36.680
 I thank you 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.070
 another wave forward welcome many 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.140
 Thank you 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.980
 to order bathe with cold water 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.500
 menstrual cramps increase 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:49.820
 yes I think that if I'm not sure but 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:52.220
 I think that I do say it from experience 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.670
 mine but from some people that I 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.520
 have commented this month so effectively 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.800
 no no to women maybe not when 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.050
 are in full menstruation do not 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.390
 it causes to put a sachet of water 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.250
 hot is not true and with that they say 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.040
 what happens to them even take some 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.260
 oregano herbs or something hot things 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.110
 imagine that outside the body 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.960
 also ask the same thing you're going to bathe and 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.600
 that can cause contractures in the 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.610
 uterus that is full in this case the 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.540
 endometrium that will descend in a manner 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.920
 of rule then yes it can produce 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.320
 contractions in the stomach that come 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.660
 to be menstrual cramps that's why 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.100
 recommends warm water showers 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.100
 a sachet of hot water 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.330
 another question forward 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:48.720
 hi my name is catherine i would like 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.470
 know if the hand dryers with air 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:55.290
 This is as hygienic as towels 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.330
 of paper that there are sometimes in the 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.980
 bathrooms in the theaters and those things 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.630
 I have my doubts 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.060
 I do not know but the truth is that 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.730
 when you get your hands wet and then 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.040
 What does he do 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.659
 no and you shake everything agreed in the bathroom 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.549
 and you put it down and then and at the end 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:12.379
 you end up doing so because it is not 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:15.230
 complete instead a small sheet of paper 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:16.819
 taken out of there does not dry his hands and 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.409
 trash boot I think it's much more 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:22.030
 hygienic that having an air 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:22.030
 ventilating and spreading microbes 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:29.890
 a question hello that such forward by 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:34.430
 please is it possible for a baby to 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:36.560
 suffer from appendicitis absolutely yes 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.579
 there is a specialty called 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.920
 pediatric surgery because the children but 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:46.819
 most frequent at the most frequent age 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.230
 I would say between 9 and 21 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.290
 years that's the age at which 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.430
 presents with greater incidence the 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.959
 pictures of appendicitis in children 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.469
 let's say not newborns I actually 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:02.510
 I do not know what there is but for example in children 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:04.760
 This year there may be 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.250
 appendicitis we have seen several cases and 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.669
 for that it is much better to consult 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.109
 first to the pediatrician that part 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:13.970
 medical because this has to go 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:16.160
 evaluating the little children get dehydrated 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.489
 Many require hydration before 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.709
 operate it and for that there is a specialty 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.560
 a cute faith specialty in reality 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:27.289
 that pediatric surgery and that here in 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.509
 Peru we have excellent doctors 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:31.090
 pediatric surgeons who can help us 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:34.060
 very much 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.280
 at least have a very treatment 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.100
 adequate of these children especially now 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.080
 that there is laparoscopic surgery and 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.840
 without transgressing the abdominal wall much 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.680
 one can evaluate and investigate all the 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.680
 belly of a baby 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.180

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.590
 friends there are risks inherent in the 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.270
 beach but the beach is a place where 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:17.050

 a bottle thrown into the sea can be 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.560

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.470

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.889
 risks 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:50.680
 we must eliminate all that memory that 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:53.980
 one does not let him be happy do not be 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:57.380
 accumulator of negative memories 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:06:01.670
 change them for something positive and for 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:04.240
 colors that give life and happiness
