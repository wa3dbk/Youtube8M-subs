00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:06.609 
so I have a little piece of you PO here

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:09.810 
so I have a little piece of you PO here
this<00:00:07.609> is<00:00:07.790> just<00:00:07.970> kind<00:00:08.840> of<00:00:08.900> a<00:00:08.990> demonstration

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:09.820 
this is just kind of a demonstration

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:20.740 
this is just kind of a demonstration
piece<00:00:10.820> and<00:00:11.090> this<00:00:11.150> is<00:00:11.210> India<00:00:11.660> ink<00:00:11.900> and<00:00:19.570> this<00:00:20.570> is

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
piece and this is India ink and this is

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.589 
piece and this is India ink and this is
on<00:00:20.929> as<00:00:21.500> you<00:00:21.769> can<00:00:21.920> see<00:00:22.099> a<00:00:22.310> table<00:00:22.670> surface<00:00:23.330> rather

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:23.599 
on as you can see a table surface rather

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.820 
on as you can see a table surface rather
than<00:00:25.240> the<00:00:26.240> wall<00:00:26.509> which<00:00:27.019> works<00:00:27.589> a<00:00:27.740> little

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
than the wall which works a little

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:28.929 
than the wall which works a little
differently<00:00:28.250> because<00:00:28.429> you<00:00:28.550> get<00:00:28.670> to<00:00:28.759> work<00:00:28.880> with

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
differently because you get to work with

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.599 
differently because you get to work with
the<00:00:29.240> drips<00:00:30.070> well<00:00:31.070> I'm<00:00:31.220> just<00:00:31.369> going<00:00:31.519> to

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:31.609 
the drips well I'm just going to

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:34.140 
the drips well I'm just going to
demonstrate<00:00:32.320> using<00:00:33.320> a<00:00:33.560> few<00:00:33.800> different

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.150 
demonstrate using a few different

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:44.619 
demonstrate using a few different
materials<00:00:35.150> with<00:00:35.420> what<00:00:36.320> this<00:00:36.530> ink<00:00:43.360> okay<00:00:44.360> the

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
materials with what this ink okay the

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.930 
materials with what this ink okay the
first<00:00:44.809> thing<00:00:45.020> is<00:00:45.590> this<00:00:45.770> is<00:00:45.980> the<00:00:46.190> ammonia

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
first thing is this is the ammonia

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.729 
first thing is this is the ammonia
diluted<00:00:47.600> about<00:00:47.809> half<00:00:48.050> and<00:00:48.199> half<00:00:48.230> with<00:00:48.530> water

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
diluted about half and half with water

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:54.420 
diluted about half and half with water
I'm<00:00:49.730> applying<00:00:50.090> it<00:00:50.239> with<00:00:50.390> a<00:00:50.449> brush<00:00:50.750> and<00:00:52.090> then

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
I'm applying it with a brush and then

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.650 
I'm applying it with a brush and then
household<00:00:55.430> squeegee<00:00:55.940> oh<00:00:58.329> this<00:00:59.329> spray<00:00:59.629> bottle

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
household squeegee oh this spray bottle

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:12.870 
household squeegee oh this spray bottle
has<00:01:01.059> diluted<00:01:02.059> ammonia<00:01:02.629> in<00:01:02.840> it

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.630 

now<00:01:13.880> if<00:01:13.970> I<00:01:14.060> take<00:01:14.210> a<00:01:14.270> little<00:01:14.480> diluted<00:01:14.960> ammonia

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
now if I take a little diluted ammonia

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.570 
now if I take a little diluted ammonia
on<00:01:16.640> my<00:01:17.360> paper<00:01:17.600> towel<00:01:17.900> I<00:01:18.260> can<00:01:18.920> just<00:01:19.100> remove<00:01:19.400> the

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
on my paper towel I can just remove the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:02:07.190 
on my paper towel I can just remove the
ink<00:01:19.730> altogether

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.390 

so<00:02:08.200> what<00:02:08.380> happens<00:02:08.680> if<00:02:08.770> I<00:02:08.860> just<00:02:09.040> use<00:02:09.220> plain

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:09.400 
so what happens if I just use plain

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.070 
so what happens if I just use plain
water

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:29.380 

that's<00:02:14.080> squeegee<00:02:16.500> right<00:02:17.500> remove<00:02:18.010> some<00:02:18.310> of<00:02:18.340> it

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.960 

now<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:29.990> inks<00:02:30.410> are<00:02:30.560> cures<00:02:31.100> after<00:02:31.550> it<00:02:31.610> sits<00:02:31.820> for

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
now the inks are cures after it sits for

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.780 
now the inks are cures after it sits for
a<00:02:32.030> few<00:02:32.210> days<00:02:32.470> so<00:02:33.470> after<00:02:33.950> a<00:02:33.980> few<00:02:34.040> days<00:02:34.370> it

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
a few days so after a few days it

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.730 
a few days so after a few days it
wouldn't<00:02:35.210> be<00:02:35.300> as<00:02:35.510> easy<00:02:35.810> to<00:02:35.990> remove<00:02:36.440> it<00:02:36.590> with

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
wouldn't be as easy to remove it with

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.660 
wouldn't be as easy to remove it with
water<00:02:37.040> but<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.550> ammonia<00:02:39.070> will<00:02:40.070> still<00:02:40.340> remove

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
water but the ammonia will still remove

00:02:40.670 --> 00:03:03.720 
water but the ammonia will still remove
it<00:02:44.260> let's<00:02:45.260> try<00:02:45.530> water<00:02:46.420> applied<00:02:47.420> with<00:02:47.870> a<00:02:47.900> brush

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.850 

and<00:03:04.730> then<00:03:04.840> let's<00:03:05.840> try<00:03:07.150> little<00:03:08.150> ink

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
and then let's try little ink

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:24.479 
and then let's try little ink
application<00:03:19.780> while<00:03:20.780> it's<00:03:20.959> still<00:03:21.260> wet

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.330 

see<00:03:25.489> if<00:03:25.580> we<00:03:25.700> can<00:03:25.850> use<00:03:25.880> some<00:03:26.239> of<00:03:26.270> that<00:03:26.390> drip

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
see if we can use some of that drip

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:47.270 
see if we can use some of that drip
action

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.100 

I'll<00:03:48.280> use<00:03:48.460> a<00:03:48.490> q-tip<00:03:48.880> dipping<00:03:49.630> it<00:03:49.750> in<00:03:49.930> the

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
I'll use a q-tip dipping it in the

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:56.970 
I'll use a q-tip dipping it in the
ammonia<00:03:51.360> solution<00:03:55.350> now<00:03:56.350> I'll<00:03:56.500> try<00:03:56.650> a<00:03:56.680> couple

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
ammonia solution now I'll try a couple

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:05.150 
ammonia solution now I'll try a couple
things<00:03:57.250> here<00:03:57.520> see<00:03:58.350> take<00:03:59.350> a<00:03:59.380> clean<00:03:59.740> paper<00:04:00.040> towel

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:14.470 

and<00:04:06.160> lift<00:04:06.640> that

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:27.490 

I'll<00:04:15.480> try<00:04:15.870> it<00:04:15.900> again<00:04:23.180> using<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.650> squeegee<00:04:25.650> a

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
I'll try it again using the squeegee a

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.590 
I'll try it again using the squeegee a
different<00:04:28.500> sort<00:04:28.710> of<00:04:28.770> mark<00:04:29.210> another<00:04:30.210> thing<00:04:30.480> I

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
different sort of mark another thing I

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:37.430 
different sort of mark another thing I
tried<00:04:30.930> last<00:04:31.860> week<00:04:35.030> kind<00:04:36.030> of<00:04:36.120> cool<00:04:36.330> using<00:04:37.320> this

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
tried last week kind of cool using this

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:50.790 
tried last week kind of cool using this
scouring<00:04:38.400> pad

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:58.279 

so<00:04:51.639> that<00:04:51.849> got<00:04:52.090> some<00:04:52.270> interesting<00:04:52.599> marks

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:04.830 

another<00:04:59.289> application<00:04:59.830> tool<00:05:00.190> for<00:05:00.490> the<00:05:01.050> C<00:05:03.840> for

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
another application tool for the C for

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.059 
another application tool for the C for
the<00:05:04.960> ammonia<00:05:05.259> is<00:05:05.560> a<00:05:05.919> tampon<00:05:07.560> to<00:05:08.560> have<00:05:08.830> some

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:09.069 
the ammonia is a tampon to have some

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:16.200 
the ammonia is a tampon to have some
kind<00:05:09.280> of<00:05:09.340> use<00:05:09.520> for<00:05:09.729> these<00:05:09.849> things<00:05:15.210> first

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
kind of use for these things first

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.300 
kind of use for these things first
different<00:05:16.539> brands<00:05:17.080> probably<00:05:17.560> make<00:05:17.919> different

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
different brands probably make different

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.839 
different brands probably make different
marks<00:05:18.699> so<00:05:18.909> you<00:05:18.940> can<00:05:19.210> try<00:05:19.509> that<00:05:19.720> out<00:05:20.520> and<00:05:21.520> you

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:21.849 
marks so you can try that out and you

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:25.890 
marks so you can try that out and you
could<00:05:22.000> just<00:05:22.180> leave<00:05:22.419> that<00:05:24.300> maybe<00:05:25.300> I'll<00:05:25.449> leave

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
could just leave that maybe I'll leave

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.920 
could just leave that maybe I'll leave
this<00:05:26.199> mark<00:05:26.530> down<00:05:26.710> here<00:05:26.770> and<00:05:27.569> squeeze<00:05:28.569> you<00:05:28.750> this

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
this mark down here and squeeze you this

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:34.860 
this mark down here and squeeze you this
top<00:05:29.259> one<00:05:33.150> and<00:05:34.150> another<00:05:34.449> thing<00:05:34.720> I<00:05:34.840> just

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
top one and another thing I just

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.649 
top one and another thing I just
discovered<00:05:35.770> was<00:05:36.099> applying<00:05:36.759> the<00:05:37.000> ammonia<00:05:37.479> and

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:37.659 
discovered was applying the ammonia and

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:39.360 
discovered was applying the ammonia and
when<00:05:38.050> I<00:05:38.080> say<00:05:38.289> ammonia<00:05:38.710> I<00:05:38.740> mean<00:05:39.009> the<00:05:39.130> ammonia

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
when I say ammonia I mean the ammonia

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:46.230 
when I say ammonia I mean the ammonia
solution<00:05:41.370> with<00:05:42.370> a<00:05:42.610> stamp<00:05:44.520> so<00:05:45.520> this<00:05:45.759> is<00:05:45.909> just<00:05:46.060> a

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
solution with a stamp so this is just a

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.459 
solution with a stamp so this is just a
stamp<00:05:46.539> I<00:05:46.690> made<00:05:46.900> from<00:05:47.199> craft<00:05:47.530> foam<00:05:49.259> see<00:05:50.259> if<00:05:50.319> this

00:05:50.459 --> 00:05:50.469 
stamp I made from craft foam see if this

00:05:50.469 --> 00:06:05.430 
stamp I made from craft foam see if this
works

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.570 

it<00:06:06.440> does<00:06:08.590> another<00:06:09.590> thing<00:06:09.740> you<00:06:09.920> can<00:06:10.070> use<00:06:10.130> on<00:06:10.460> you

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
it does another thing you can use on you

it does another thing you can use on you
cope<00:06:10.820> with<00:06:11.000> this<00:06:11.120> process<00:06:11.570> is<00:06:12.130> pit<00:06:13.130> pins

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
cope with this process is pit pins

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:20.820 
cope with this process is pit pins
because<00:06:14.960> they<00:06:15.440> are<00:06:15.620> after<00:06:15.980> all<00:06:16.190> into<00:06:16.640> your<00:06:16.760> ink

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.790 

and<00:06:22.450> they<00:06:23.450> come<00:06:23.690> in<00:06:23.810> these<00:06:23.930> great<00:06:24.200> big<00:06:24.380> fat

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 
and they come in these great big fat

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.600 
and they come in these great big fat
ones<00:06:25.490> they<00:06:25.910> come<00:06:26.210> in<00:06:26.830> little<00:06:27.830> skinny<00:06:28.250> ones

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:28.610 
ones they come in little skinny ones

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.790 
ones they come in little skinny ones
they<00:06:29.540> come<00:06:29.750> in<00:06:29.870> this<00:06:29.990> whole<00:06:30.760> array<00:06:31.760> of<00:06:31.790> tips

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 
they come in this whole array of tips

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:39.690 
they come in this whole array of tips
see<00:06:33.800> what<00:06:34.010> that<00:06:34.340> does<00:06:35.080> okay<00:06:37.720> nothing<00:06:38.720> much

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:39.700 
see what that does okay nothing much

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:44.500 
see what that does okay nothing much
smeared<00:06:40.700> it<00:06:40.820> let's<00:06:41.390> try<00:06:41.510> that<00:06:41.660> again<00:06:43.450> see<00:06:44.450> if

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:44.510 
smeared it let's try that again see if

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:45.640 
smeared it let's try that again see if
we<00:06:44.690> get<00:06:44.900> anything<00:06:45.230> a<00:06:45.410> little<00:06:45.530> more

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:45.650 
we get anything a little more

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:52.050 
we get anything a little more
interesting

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.060 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:07:18.350 

it's<00:06:53.060> q-tip<00:06:53.720> with<00:06:53.900> ammonia

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:29.189 

here<00:07:19.360> I'm<00:07:19.479> using<00:07:19.539> the<00:07:19.840> side<00:07:20.110> of<00:07:20.379> the<00:07:20.439> roller<00:07:28.199> so

00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:29.199 
here I'm using the side of the roller so

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:37.350 
here I'm using the side of the roller so
just<00:07:29.620> the<00:07:30.520> squeegee<00:07:31.210> to<00:07:31.689> make<00:07:31.870> line<00:07:32.199> I<00:07:36.360> also

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.360 
just the squeegee to make line I also

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.040 
just the squeegee to make line I also
use<00:07:37.659> a<00:07:37.860> gift<00:07:38.860> card<00:07:39.129> or<00:07:39.340> credit<00:07:39.520> card<00:07:39.870> well<00:07:40.870> the

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:41.050 
use a gift card or credit card well the

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:42.529 
use a gift card or credit card well the
ink<00:07:41.259> is<00:07:41.409> still<00:07:41.529> wet

00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:42.539 
ink is still wet

00:07:42.539 --> 00:07:45.149 
ink is still wet
as<00:07:43.539> it<00:07:43.719> is<00:07:43.840> over<00:07:44.050> here<00:07:44.349> but<00:07:44.469> it's<00:07:44.620> dried<00:07:44.919> right

00:07:45.149 --> 00:07:45.159 
as it is over here but it's dried right

00:07:45.159 --> 00:07:47.730 
as it is over here but it's dried right
here<00:07:45.460> and<00:07:46.029> it<00:07:46.569> dries<00:07:46.779> really<00:07:47.020> quickly<00:07:47.409> you'll

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:47.740 
here and it dries really quickly you'll

00:07:47.740 --> 00:08:05.840 
here and it dries really quickly you'll
find

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:05.850 

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:07.860 

and<00:08:06.850> that's<00:08:07.060> probably<00:08:07.210> enough<00:08:07.570> things<00:08:07.810> to

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:07.870 
and that's probably enough things to

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.560 
and that's probably enough things to
play<00:08:08.080> with<00:08:08.139> for<00:08:08.440> now
