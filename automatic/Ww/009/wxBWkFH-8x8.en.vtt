yeah<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.960> grammars<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.290> little<00:01:58.560> off<00:01:58.680> but<00:01:58.950> you

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
yeah the grammars a little off but you

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.130 
yeah the grammars a little off but you
get<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.430> point<00:01:59.700> combine<00:02:00.420> these<00:02:00.570> three<00:02:00.869> tweets

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
get the point combine these three tweets

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.350 
get the point combine these three tweets
and<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:01.829> easy<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.219> guess<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.969> next

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
and it is easy to guess that the next

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.179 
and it is easy to guess that the next
trailer<00:02:03.570> will<00:02:03.780> focus<00:02:04.049> less<00:02:04.350> on<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.680> action

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
trailer will focus less on the action

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.100 
trailer will focus less on the action
and<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.430> set<00:02:05.700> pieces<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.390> more<00:02:06.810> on<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.049> story

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
and the set pieces and more on the story

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.320 
and the set pieces and more on the story
and<00:02:07.409> theme<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:07.979> game<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:08.789> also<00:02:09.000> safe<00:02:09.300> to

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
and theme of the game it is also safe to

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.089 
and theme of the game it is also safe to
assume<00:02:09.569> that<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.319> trailer<00:02:10.560> will<00:02:10.890> feature

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099
