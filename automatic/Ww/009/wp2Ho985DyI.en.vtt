okay<00:00:01.500> in<00:00:01.709> these<00:00:02.070> examples<00:00:02.220> I<00:00:02.700> want<00:00:02.879> to<00:00:02.939> talk

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
okay in these examples I want to talk

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.180 
okay in these examples I want to talk
about<00:00:03.300> converting<00:00:04.110> between<00:00:04.319> rational

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
about converting between rational

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.940 
about converting between rational
exponents<00:00:05.910> and<00:00:06.000> radicals<00:00:06.180> and<00:00:06.750> in<00:00:07.560> this<00:00:07.710> case

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
exponents and radicals and in this case

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:08.960 
exponents and radicals and in this case
what<00:00:08.160> we're<00:00:08.280> going<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:08.429> do<00:00:08.610> is<00:00:08.760> we're<00:00:08.940> just

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
what we're going to do is we're just

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.200 
what we're going to do is we're just
going<00:00:09.150> to<00:00:09.210> evaluate<00:00:09.840> some<00:00:10.200> some<00:00:11.130> numbers<00:00:11.490> so

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
going to evaluate some some numbers so

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.360 
going to evaluate some some numbers so
we<00:00:12.330> have<00:00:12.420> 25<00:00:12.809> to<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.200> three-halves<00:00:13.590> 25<00:00:14.130> to<00:00:14.309> the

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
we have 25 to the three-halves 25 to the

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.820 
we have 25 to the three-halves 25 to the
negative<00:00:14.759> three-halves<00:00:15.179> 64<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.410> negative

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
negative three-halves 64 to the negative

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.140 
negative three-halves 64 to the negative
4/3<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.730> 16<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.660> positive<00:00:19.260> 3/4<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.939> main

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
4/3 and 16 to the positive 3/4 the main

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.910 
4/3 and 16 to the positive 3/4 the main
rule<00:00:21.510> again<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:22.050> we're<00:00:22.140> going<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.320> use<00:00:22.560> here

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
rule again that we're going to use here

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.420 
rule again that we're going to use here
or<00:00:23.130> at<00:00:23.250> least<00:00:23.279> one<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.699> them<00:00:24.920> it<00:00:25.920> says<00:00:26.130> if<00:00:26.310> you

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
or at least one of them it says if you

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.400 
or at least one of them it says if you
have<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.820> X<00:00:27.599> raised<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.830> N<00:00:29.130> divided<00:00:29.760> by<00:00:30.029> M<00:00:30.410> we

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
have a X raised to the N divided by M we

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.250 
have a X raised to the N divided by M we
can<00:00:31.439> write<00:00:32.009> that<00:00:32.250> as<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.579> radical<00:00:34.100> or<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.160> root

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
can write that as a radical or a root

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.319 
can write that as a radical or a root
the<00:00:37.260> number<00:00:37.620> on<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.980> bottom<00:00:38.190> goes<00:00:38.670> out<00:00:38.879> front

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
the number on the bottom goes out front

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.369 
the number on the bottom goes out front
that<00:00:39.899> becomes<00:00:40.290> our<00:00:40.469> root<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.360> then<00:00:42.360> we<00:00:42.780> stick

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
that becomes our root and then we stick

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.600 
that becomes our root and then we stick
our<00:00:43.530> X<00:00:43.800> underneath<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.820> radical<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:46.460> then<00:00:47.460> we

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
our X underneath the radical and then we

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.150 
our X underneath the radical and then we
raise<00:00:48.030> all<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.140> N<00:00:49.320> power<00:00:49.680> which

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
raise all of that to the N power which

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.260 
raise all of that to the N power which
is<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.489> part<00:00:50.730> on<00:00:50.879> top<00:00:52.160> okay<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.460> let's<00:00:54.059> do<00:00:54.239> a

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
is the part on top okay so let's do a

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.049 
is the part on top okay so let's do a
few<00:00:54.390> examples<00:00:54.690> here<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:57.500> 25<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.890> the

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
few examples here so 25 to the

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.460 
few examples here so 25 to the
three-halves<00:01:00.059> let's<00:01:00.840> do<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.170> one<00:01:01.350> first

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
three-halves let's do that one first

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.110 
three-halves let's do that one first
so<00:01:04.470> what<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:04.680> would<00:01:04.800> do<00:01:05.070> again<00:01:05.550> just<00:01:05.970> simply

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.120 
so what I would do again just simply

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:12.560 
so what I would do again just simply
rewrite<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:10.640> ok<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:11.700> again<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.420> denominator

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
rewrite this ok so again the denominator

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.140 
rewrite this ok so again the denominator
becomes<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.770> root<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.700> square

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
becomes the root so this is a square

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.180 
becomes the root so this is a square
root<00:01:15.180> we<00:01:15.600> don't<00:01:15.780> always<00:01:16.020> write<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.770> but<00:01:16.950> let's

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
root we don't always write it but let's

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.130 
root we don't always write it but let's
just<00:01:17.400> emphasize<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:18.150> here<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.690> a<00:01:18.720> square

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
just emphasize it here this is a square

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.300 
just emphasize it here this is a square
root<00:01:20.360> cubed<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.720> then<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.440> think<00:01:22.710> what<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.159> the

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
root cubed and then I think what is the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.719 
root cubed and then I think what is the
square<00:01:23.700> root<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.210> pot<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.780> 25<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.460> square

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
square root of pot of 25 and the square

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.510 
square root of pot of 25 and the square
root<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.970> 25<00:01:27.530> remember<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.560> square<00:01:29.070> root<00:01:29.250> any

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
root of 25 remember a square root any

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.399 
root of 25 remember a square root any
even<00:01:30.000> powered<00:01:30.330> root<00:01:30.509> is<00:01:30.630> always<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:31.110> positive

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
even powered root is always a positive

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.300 
even powered root is always a positive
number<00:01:31.800> so<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.550> square<00:01:32.850> root<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.119> 25<00:01:33.630> is

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
number so the square root of 25 is

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.400 
number so the square root of 25 is
positive<00:01:35.310> 5<00:01:35.550> and<00:01:35.910> then<00:01:36.690> we<00:01:36.810> have<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:37.080> raise

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
positive 5 and then we have to raise

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.029 
positive 5 and then we have to raise
that<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.039> third<00:01:38.399> power<00:01:38.780> so<00:01:39.780> 5<00:01:40.080> times<00:01:40.410> 5<00:01:40.710> is

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039 
that to the third power so 5 times 5 is

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.499 
that to the third power so 5 times 5 is
25<00:01:41.429> times<00:01:42.270> another<00:01:42.690> 5<00:01:42.990> would<00:01:43.770> give<00:01:43.979> us<00:01:44.160> 125<00:01:45.149> as

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
25 times another 5 would give us 125 as

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.090 
25 times another 5 would give us 125 as
our<00:01:45.720> solution<00:01:47.330> ok<00:01:48.330> so<00:01:48.420> 25<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.289> the<00:01:49.410> negative<00:01:49.800> 3

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
our solution ok so 25 to the negative 3

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.150 
our solution ok so 25 to the negative 3
halves<00:01:50.600> again<00:01:51.600> we<00:01:51.929> could<00:01:52.080> write<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.470> as<00:01:52.649> 25

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
halves again we could write that as 25

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.560 
halves again we could write that as 25
to<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.640> negative<00:01:54.060> 3<00:01:54.450> halves<00:01:56.119> divided<00:01:57.119> by<00:01:57.270> one

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
to the negative 3 halves divided by one

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.840 
to the negative 3 halves divided by one
you<00:01:57.960> can<00:01:57.990> write<00:01:58.259> anything<00:01:58.560> over<00:01:59.310> one<00:01:59.550> that

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
you can write anything over one that

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.240 
you can write anything over one that
doesn't<00:02:00.149> change<00:02:00.390> its<00:02:00.600> value<00:02:01.050> and<00:02:01.350> now<00:02:02.039> we're

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
doesn't change its value and now we're

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.550 
doesn't change its value and now we're
going<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.429> use<00:02:02.720> one<00:02:03.720> of<00:02:03.750> our<00:02:03.899> algebraic

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
going to use one of our algebraic

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.010 
going to use one of our algebraic
properties<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.520> says<00:02:05.789> well<00:02:06.090> if<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.840> have<00:02:06.990> a

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
properties that says well if you have a

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.370 
properties that says well if you have a
negative<00:02:07.380> exponent<00:02:07.800> to<00:02:08.700> make<00:02:08.880> it<00:02:09.030> positive

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
negative exponent to make it positive

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.930 
negative exponent to make it positive
you<00:02:10.380> move<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.160> other<00:02:11.190> side<00:02:11.640> of<00:02:11.849> the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
you move it to the other side of the

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.900 
you move it to the other side of the
fraction

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.150 

so<00:02:16.910> now<00:02:17.060> we'll<00:02:17.270> have<00:02:17.300> 25<00:02:17.870> to<00:02:18.350> the<00:02:18.500> three-halves

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
so now we'll have 25 to the three-halves

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.570 
so now we'll have 25 to the three-halves
in<00:02:19.550> the<00:02:19.760> denominator<00:02:20.590> but<00:02:21.590> we<00:02:21.740> know<00:02:21.890> what<00:02:22.100> 25

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
in the denominator but we know what 25

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.520 
in the denominator but we know what 25
to<00:02:22.910> the<00:02:23.030> three-halves<00:02:23.540> is<00:02:23.840> that's<00:02:24.260> what<00:02:24.410> we

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
to the three-halves is that's what we

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.310 
to the three-halves is that's what we
already<00:02:24.770> figured<00:02:24.950> out<00:02:25.130> in<00:02:25.310> part<00:02:25.550> a<00:02:25.700> so<00:02:26.140> in<00:02:27.140> this

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
already figured out in part a so in this

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.090 
already figured out in part a so in this
case<00:02:27.590> we'll<00:02:27.830> end<00:02:28.040> up<00:02:28.100> getting<00:02:28.160> 1<00:02:28.910> over<00:02:29.440> 125<00:02:30.440> as

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
case we'll end up getting 1 over 125 as

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.730 
case we'll end up getting 1 over 125 as
our<00:02:31.250> solution

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
our solution

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.830 
our solution
okay<00:02:33.740> so<00:02:33.800> 64<00:02:34.520> to<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:34.700> negative<00:02:35.090> 4/3<00:02:35.510> let's

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
okay so 64 to the negative 4/3 let's

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.350 
okay so 64 to the negative 4/3 let's
just<00:02:35.990> do<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.230> same<00:02:36.410> thing<00:02:37.030> so<00:02:38.030> that<00:02:38.150> would<00:02:38.270> be

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
just do the same thing so that would be

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.830 
just do the same thing so that would be
64<00:02:40.450> to<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.570> negative<00:02:41.960> 4/3<00:02:42.500> over<00:02:42.860> 1<00:02:43.630> okay<00:02:44.630> so<00:02:44.690> I

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
64 to the negative 4/3 over 1 okay so I

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.380 
64 to the negative 4/3 over 1 okay so I
can<00:02:45.050> rewrite<00:02:45.290> this<00:02:45.500> as<00:02:45.920> 1<00:02:46.130> over<00:02:46.160> 64<00:02:46.910> to<00:02:47.360> the

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
can rewrite this as 1 over 64 to the

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.060 
can rewrite this as 1 over 64 to the
positive<00:02:48.050> 4/3<00:02:50.050> and<00:02:51.050> again<00:02:51.500> now<00:02:51.650> I'm<00:02:51.800> going<00:02:52.010> to

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
positive 4/3 and again now I'm going to

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.550 
positive 4/3 and again now I'm going to
rewrite<00:02:52.340> this<00:02:52.850> using<00:02:52.910> my<00:02:53.570> my<00:02:54.140> radical

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
rewrite this using my my radical

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.460 
rewrite this using my my radical
notation<00:02:55.300> so<00:02:56.300> it<00:02:56.810> says<00:02:57.050> we<00:02:57.230> write<00:02:57.440> a<00:02:57.470> root<00:02:59.470> it

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
notation so it says we write a root it

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.810 
notation so it says we write a root it
says<00:03:00.710> whatever<00:03:00.920> numbers<00:03:01.400> on<00:03:01.520> the<00:03:01.640> bottom

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
says whatever numbers on the bottom

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.820 
says whatever numbers on the bottom
that's<00:03:02.210> what<00:03:02.420> that's<00:03:02.750> what<00:03:02.930> our<00:03:03.020> root<00:03:03.260> is<00:03:03.440> so

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
that's what that's what our root is so

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.350 
that's what that's what our root is so
here<00:03:04.010> we're<00:03:04.190> going<00:03:04.220> to<00:03:04.340> have<00:03:04.460> the<00:03:04.640> third<00:03:04.940> root

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
here we're going to have the third root

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.310 
here we're going to have the third root
of<00:03:05.600> 64<00:03:06.290> and<00:03:07.180> we're<00:03:08.180> going<00:03:08.300> to<00:03:08.330> raise<00:03:08.570> all<00:03:08.990> of

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
of 64 and we're going to raise all of

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.090 
of 64 and we're going to raise all of
that<00:03:09.530> to<00:03:09.830> the<00:03:09.950> 4th<00:03:10.250> power<00:03:10.810> okay<00:03:11.810> so<00:03:12.170> you<00:03:12.980> know

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
that to the 4th power okay so you know

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.700 
that to the 4th power okay so you know
just<00:03:13.310> like<00:03:13.430> I<00:03:13.580> think<00:03:14.050> you<00:03:15.050> know<00:03:15.140> in<00:03:15.200> elementary

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 
just like I think you know in elementary

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:16.840 
just like I think you know in elementary
school<00:03:15.950> they<00:03:16.070> say<00:03:16.220> hey<00:03:16.370> you<00:03:16.400> have<00:03:16.550> to<00:03:16.730> learn

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
school they say hey you have to learn

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.550 
school they say hey you have to learn
your<00:03:17.030> multiplication<00:03:17.150> tables<00:03:18.080> I<00:03:18.230> think<00:03:18.440> it's

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
your multiplication tables I think it's

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.830 
your multiplication tables I think it's
definitely<00:03:18.770> a<00:03:19.070> good<00:03:19.100> idea<00:03:19.280> to<00:03:19.820> know<00:03:20.000> some

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
definitely a good idea to know some

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.900 
definitely a good idea to know some
powers<00:03:21.290> of<00:03:21.650> numbers<00:03:22.780> because<00:03:24.580> otherwise<00:03:25.580> it's

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
powers of numbers because otherwise it's

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.890 
powers of numbers because otherwise it's
just<00:03:26.060> hard<00:03:26.270> to<00:03:26.390> recognize<00:03:26.900> sometimes<00:03:27.230> so<00:03:27.950> in

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
just hard to recognize sometimes so in

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.290 
just hard to recognize sometimes so in
this<00:03:29.900> case<00:03:30.200> I'm<00:03:30.470> thinking<00:03:30.950> what<00:03:31.670> number<00:03:32.060> times

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
this case I'm thinking what number times

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.370 
this case I'm thinking what number times
itself<00:03:32.780> 3<00:03:33.260> times<00:03:33.290> gives<00:03:34.010> me<00:03:34.160> 64<00:03:34.670> and

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
itself 3 times gives me 64 and

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.200 
itself 3 times gives me 64 and
maybe<00:03:37.190> you<00:03:37.400> know<00:03:37.520> this<00:03:37.670> one<00:03:37.790> off<00:03:37.910> the<00:03:38.030> top<00:03:38.180> of

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.210 
maybe you know this one off the top of

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.770 
maybe you know this one off the top of
your<00:03:38.360> head<00:03:38.570> maybe<00:03:38.840> you<00:03:38.990> don't<00:03:39.490> so<00:03:40.490> again<00:03:41.450> so<00:03:41.660> if

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
your head maybe you don't so again so if

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.480 
your head maybe you don't so again so if
you<00:03:41.870> think<00:03:41.990> about<00:03:42.140> it<00:03:42.440> you<00:03:42.950> can<00:03:43.070> always<00:03:43.280> check

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.490 
you think about it you can always check

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.280 
you think about it you can always check
on<00:03:43.700> two<00:03:43.880> times<00:03:44.120> two<00:03:44.330> times<00:03:44.360> two<00:03:44.630> that's<00:03:45.140> not

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
on two times two times two that's not

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.230 
on two times two times two that's not
right<00:03:45.590> three<00:03:45.980> times<00:03:46.100> three<00:03:46.370> times<00:03:46.400> three<00:03:46.670> I

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:47.240 
right three times three times three I

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.090 
right three times three times three I
don't<00:03:47.390> think<00:03:47.600> that's<00:03:47.750> right<00:03:48.020> but<00:03:48.800> four<00:03:49.070> times

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
don't think that's right but four times

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.480 
don't think that's right but four times
four<00:03:49.640> times<00:03:49.670> four<00:03:50.270> that<00:03:51.020> will<00:03:51.200> give<00:03:51.410> me<00:03:51.560> 64<00:03:52.220> so

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
four times four that will give me 64 so

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.920 
four times four that will give me 64 so
the<00:03:52.610> third<00:03:52.850> root<00:03:53.120> of<00:03:53.270> 64<00:03:53.990> is<00:03:54.260> 4<00:03:55.510> and<00:03:56.510> again<00:03:56.720> now

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
the third root of 64 is 4 and again now

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.020 
the third root of 64 is 4 and again now
we<00:03:56.990> have<00:03:57.230> to<00:03:57.470> you<00:03:58.370> know<00:03:58.400> we<00:03:58.580> have<00:03:58.700> to<00:03:58.820> evaluate

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
we have to you know we have to evaluate

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.330 
we have to you know we have to evaluate
4<00:03:59.540> to<00:03:59.630> the<00:03:59.720> fourth<00:03:59.990> so<00:04:00.380> you<00:04:00.830> can<00:04:00.950> either<00:04:01.040> always

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
4 to the fourth so you can either always

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.600 
4 to the fourth so you can either always
do<00:04:01.580> it<00:04:01.700> by<00:04:01.790> hand<00:04:02.060> or<00:04:02.300> with<00:04:02.600> a<00:04:02.630> calculator<00:04:03.610> I

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
do it by hand or with a calculator I

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.450 
do it by hand or with a calculator I
believe<00:04:05.120> four<00:04:05.450> to<00:04:05.540> the<00:04:05.600> fourth<00:04:05.840> would<00:04:06.410> be<00:04:07.300> 256

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:09.460 
believe four to the fourth would be 256

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.050 
believe four to the fourth would be 256
so<00:04:11.050> 64<00:04:12.050> to<00:04:12.200> the<00:04:12.260> negative<00:04:12.680> 4/3<00:04:13.190> I<00:04:13.490> think<00:04:13.790> gets

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
so 64 to the negative 4/3 I think gets

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.390 
so 64 to the negative 4/3 I think gets
squeezed<00:04:14.420> off<00:04:14.630> there<00:04:14.900> so<00:04:15.050> 64<00:04:15.800> to<00:04:15.950> the<00:04:16.040> negative

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
squeezed off there so 64 to the negative

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.490 
squeezed off there so 64 to the negative
4/3<00:04:16.880> would<00:04:17.120> simplify<00:04:17.480> down<00:04:17.840> to<00:04:18.080> the<00:04:18.170> number

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
4/3 would simplify down to the number

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:25.570 
4/3 would simplify down to the number
one<00:04:19.100> over<00:04:19.630> 256<00:04:22.150> ok<00:04:23.150> so<00:04:23.470> last<00:04:24.470> but<00:04:24.740> not<00:04:24.980> least<00:04:25.310> we

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
one over 256 ok so last but not least we

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.630 
one over 256 ok so last but not least we
have<00:04:25.610> 16<00:04:26.150> to<00:04:26.270> the<00:04:26.330> 3/4<00:04:27.050> again<00:04:28.040> so<00:04:28.310> this<00:04:28.460> has<00:04:28.610> a

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
have 16 to the 3/4 again so this has a

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.430 
have 16 to the 3/4 again so this has a
positive<00:04:29.210> exponent<00:04:29.300> so<00:04:29.870> we<00:04:29.960> don't<00:04:30.110> have<00:04:30.200> to<00:04:30.320> do

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
positive exponent so we don't have to do

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.080 
positive exponent so we don't have to do
this<00:04:30.620> this<00:04:30.980> trick<00:04:31.310> of<00:04:31.400> moving<00:04:31.760> it<00:04:31.850> to<00:04:32.000> the

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
this this trick of moving it to the

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.570 
this this trick of moving it to the
denominator<00:04:32.590> so<00:04:33.590> again<00:04:33.890> it<00:04:34.010> says<00:04:34.190> this<00:04:34.400> time

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
denominator so again it says this time

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.300 
denominator so again it says this time
I'm<00:04:34.760> going<00:04:34.910> to<00:04:35.000> take<00:04:35.180> the<00:04:35.450> 4th<00:04:35.780> root<00:04:35.960> of<00:04:36.310> the

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
I'm going to take the 4th root of the

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.330 
I'm going to take the 4th root of the
number<00:04:37.460> 16<00:04:38.360> and<00:04:38.660> then<00:04:39.620> I'm<00:04:39.740> going<00:04:39.920> to<00:04:39.980> cube

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
number 16 and then I'm going to cube

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.180 
number 16 and then I'm going to cube
that<00:04:40.370> number<00:04:41.030> so<00:04:41.930> I<00:04:41.960> think<00:04:42.200> what<00:04:42.560> number<00:04:42.920> what

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
that number so I think what number what

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.460 
that number so I think what number what
positive<00:04:43.430> number<00:04:44.090> times<00:04:44.300> itself<00:04:44.810> 4<00:04:45.440> times

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
positive number times itself 4 times

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.780 
positive number times itself 4 times
gives<00:04:46.220> us<00:04:46.400> 3<00:04:46.820> well<00:04:47.690> I<00:04:47.990> believe<00:04:48.680> if<00:04:49.370> you

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
gives us 3 well I believe if you

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.780 
gives us 3 well I believe if you
multiply<00:04:50.330> two<00:04:51.080> by<00:04:51.500> itself<00:04:51.530> four<00:04:52.370> times<00:04:52.400> we'll

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
multiply two by itself four times we'll

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.450 
multiply two by itself four times we'll
get<00:04:52.940> 16<00:04:53.390> so<00:04:53.690> the<00:04:53.810> fourth<00:04:54.050> root<00:04:54.290> of<00:04:54.350> 16<00:04:54.560> does

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
get 16 so the fourth root of 16 does

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.330 
get 16 so the fourth root of 16 does
give<00:04:55.700> us<00:04:55.850> 2<00:04:56.090> and<00:04:56.440> then<00:04:57.440> we<00:04:57.530> have<00:04:57.650> to<00:04:57.770> take<00:04:57.950> 2<00:04:58.190> to

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
give us 2 and then we have to take 2 to

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.760 
give us 2 and then we have to take 2 to
the<00:04:58.460> third<00:04:58.730> which<00:04:59.270> will<00:04:59.480> give<00:04:59.660> us<00:04:59.690> the<00:05:00.110> value<00:05:00.260> 8

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
the third which will give us the value 8

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.420 
the third which will give us the value 8
so<00:05:01.640> 16<00:05:02.060> to<00:05:02.150> the<00:05:02.210> 3/4<00:05:02.900> is<00:05:03.140> just<00:05:03.650> a<00:05:03.770> fancy<00:05:04.040> way<00:05:04.370> to

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
so 16 to the 3/4 is just a fancy way to

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.420 
so 16 to the 3/4 is just a fancy way to
write<00:05:04.820> the<00:05:05.000> number<00:05:05.270> 8<00:05:05.480> so<00:05:05.900> all<00:05:06.650> right<00:05:06.770> I<00:05:06.920> hope

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
write the number 8 so all right I hope

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:08.980 
write the number 8 so all right I hope
these<00:05:07.610> examples<00:05:08.150> make<00:05:08.360> a<00:05:08.390> little<00:05:08.690> bit<00:05:08.900> of

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
these examples make a little bit of

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.070 
these examples make a little bit of
sense<00:05:09.730> again<00:05:10.730> you<00:05:11.000> know

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
sense again you know

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.779 
sense again you know
a<00:05:12.229> lot<00:05:12.830> of<00:05:12.949> this<00:05:13.099> comes<00:05:13.310> down<00:05:13.430> to<00:05:13.580> I<00:05:13.729> think

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:13.789 
a lot of this comes down to I think

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:16.480 
a lot of this comes down to I think
arithmetic<00:05:14.509> and<00:05:14.720> just<00:05:14.840> knowing<00:05:14.990> powers<00:05:15.560> so<00:05:16.129> if

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
arithmetic and just knowing powers so if

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.159 
arithmetic and just knowing powers so if
you've<00:05:16.639> forgotten<00:05:16.759> some<00:05:17.240> of<00:05:17.270> your<00:05:17.509> exponents

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
you've forgotten some of your exponents

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.070 
you've forgotten some of your exponents
my<00:05:18.889> advice<00:05:19.250> would<00:05:19.610> be<00:05:19.669> just<00:05:20.090> you<00:05:20.330> know<00:05:20.449> just<00:05:20.960> to

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
my advice would be just you know just to

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.270 
my advice would be just you know just to
think<00:05:21.259> about<00:05:21.379> them<00:05:21.650> maybe<00:05:21.830> write<00:05:22.069> down<00:05:22.250> a

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
think about them maybe write down a

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.610 
think about them maybe write down a
couple<00:05:22.580> because<00:05:23.180> it'll<00:05:23.569> certainly<00:05:23.990> expediate

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
couple because it'll certainly expediate

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.640 
couple because it'll certainly expediate
I<00:05:24.740> think<00:05:25.159> you<00:05:25.969> know<00:05:26.120> the<00:05:26.479> process<00:05:26.960> and

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
I think you know the process and

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.150 
I think you know the process and
certainly<00:05:27.860> save<00:05:28.219> you<00:05:28.340> time<00:05:28.490> in<00:05:28.669> the<00:05:28.699> long<00:05:28.759> run
