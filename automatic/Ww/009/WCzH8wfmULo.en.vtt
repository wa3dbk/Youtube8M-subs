00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:13.100
 and people registered for gamer 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.100
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.119
 new video a new tutorial so the 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.179
 number 7 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:24.679
 so that's for sure how to back up 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:28.699
 sabbath minecraft so back up in 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:30.259
 meaning for example we save sama 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.360
 then after we put tnt 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:34.400
 then we put back the old backup and we 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.370
 to the map injected here are these dances 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.090
 in this sense there first zealous 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.280
 on minecraft 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:44.690
 here is a kraft so at home by 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.440
 example I will show by the lines 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.000
 of my part lol this is my part that 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.809
 I started not long ago and that 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.679
 just now but that's short it's not 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.620
 this is the subject today 

00:00:54.679 --> 00:01:01.309
 so that's my little part that is 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.739
 all intact so quiet before 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.000
 this is his guard and to save you 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.160
 go to the files percent one 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.090
 ppda top-100 so you recognize me 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.030
 I made a shortcut 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.880
 you go in save then you do 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:18.350
 so no match is called was called 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:21.740
 survival 2 so made copy simple copy 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:25.520
 then you stick these waters here and there you 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:29.330
 have the map and keep yourself so now 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.070
 you can put tnt all this 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.890
 that they want and so inevitably I want 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:37.690
 really show then that it would not be 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.690
 not wise and fashion 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:45.430
 so here and I'll take the TNT 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:53.690
 tnt that's me silly bee and we're going 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.520
 take a little a plethora on the 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.840
 balance so for example i'm going to be a 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.800
 head of the six men I is active 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.070
 break the house and fight it 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.260
 balls 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.870
 that's all it's broken it's nickel 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.550
 do not care about it here are my resources and 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.310
 now if we want to put the mac back 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.590
 so is going to be the game by cons as 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.900
 that it's not obligatory so you 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.920
 go to the file for his country and 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.320
 attracts% you come back in the save food 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:27.260
 she was there, not the only one 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:28.790
 keep a memory of shares in this 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.410

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:35.840

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.430
 normally I should see the old 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:44.570
 so save your your pretty ma 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:49.880

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:56.380
 broken 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:58.690

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:12.310
