I<00:01:13.979> think<00:01:14.400> we're<00:01:14.520> addressing<00:01:14.960> a<00:01:16.130> market<00:01:17.130> that

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
I think we're addressing a market that

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.679 
I think we're addressing a market that
hasn't<00:01:18.000> been<00:01:18.299> addressed<00:01:18.720> yet<00:01:18.840> it's<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.890> new

between tactical and fashion it adds a

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.670
