more difficult because everybody eats

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.040 
more difficult because everybody eats
things<00:00:50.250> differently<00:00:50.850> everybody<00:00:51.450> might<00:00:51.900> not

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 
like the same type food you guys might

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.780
