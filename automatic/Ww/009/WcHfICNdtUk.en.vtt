00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.310

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.980
 We write the sixth of september 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:22.590
 In 2014 and 21 months it took until 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.670
 probably the most modern junior center in 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.349
 Europe has been completed on many 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.330
 countless square meters goes here 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.700
 education and sport hand in hand it is 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.649
 maybe the coolest wg but you have to 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.390
 Of course, what can be done and how exactly 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.920
 look that would be us now 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.920
 Let's start together Let's go 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.730
 the sebastian r is with me and you 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:56.420
 Never join the freestyle kicker 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:00.410
 has to show your then begin to 13:00 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:04.420
 in the square and has a chance others 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.420
 people so ubiquitous 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.340
 the onslaught of the sensational lama people 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.020
 actually expected to be so extreme in front 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.120
 but of course the whole plant speaks 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.950
 for themselves or flop we are glad that 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.750
 the seats are therefore the outer and the 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.770
 aroused in the elite of enthusiasm 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.380
 when you see that 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.400
 world class very political or outward 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.620
 and inner heat 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.440

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.259
 Youth a dream so absolutely considered 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.930

 she is very short 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.299

 people are there in such a team of supervisors 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.730
 So we look after a total of 60 educators 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.109
 they are always there for us if anything 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.269

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.140
 We can always come to you and you 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.760

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.040

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.569
 ice hockey or soccer she says please 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.450

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.069
 together has its athletes very well where 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.599

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:29.569
 athletic david together 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:31.849
 next stop the big hall 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.739
 this is very nice for artificial turf indoors 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:35.030
 impressive here is played when 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.609
 the weather does not agree with it 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.439
 cold outside is although you all places 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:41.090
 here known or 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:43.760
 I think 56 places are on everyone 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.129
 case have the artificial grass here so so 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.109
 this is the place within the 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:51.169
 hall is as big as an original falls 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:52.189
 that makes in about 68 times 105 meters and 

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:54.319
 Here you can actually remember that 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:56.239
 outside is snowing a real test game 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.870

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.299

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.419

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:09.739
 Ice hockey player and in the background can 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.659

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.530

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:14.810

 laundry, of course, that finds its way 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:21.500
 every training takes place and there takes 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.080
