00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.269 

now<00:00:01.890> I'm<00:00:02.100> making<00:00:02.220> an<00:00:02.520> effort<00:00:02.639> to<00:00:02.990> build<00:00:03.990> a

00:00:04.269 --> 00:00:04.279 
now I'm making an effort to build a

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:07.760 
now I'm making an effort to build a
model<00:00:05.279> of<00:00:05.339> a<00:00:05.460> phonograph<00:00:05.670> record<00:00:06.620> very<00:00:07.620> much

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
model of a phonograph record very much

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.379 
model of a phonograph record very much
like<00:00:07.980> this<00:00:08.189> one<00:00:08.250> complete<00:00:08.849> with<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.120> grooves

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
like this one complete with the grooves

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.509 
like this one complete with the grooves
in<00:00:09.690> it<00:00:09.780> problem<00:00:10.620> with<00:00:10.740> this<00:00:10.889> model<00:00:11.309> is<00:00:11.490> that

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
in it problem with this model is that

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.820 
in it problem with this model is that
you<00:00:11.969> can<00:00:12.690> see<00:00:12.870> through<00:00:13.170> it<00:00:13.200> because<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.620> black

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
you can see through it because the black

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.490 
you can see through it because the black
material<00:00:14.250> isn't<00:00:14.969> quite<00:00:15.240> opaque<00:00:15.599> enough<00:00:15.780> so

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
material isn't quite opaque enough so

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.560 
material isn't quite opaque enough so
what<00:00:16.590> I'm<00:00:16.710> doing<00:00:16.740> right<00:00:17.160> now<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.699> I'm<00:00:17.880> building

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
what I'm doing right now is I'm building

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.810 
what I'm doing right now is I'm building
one<00:00:18.779> layer<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.470> blue<00:00:19.710> material<00:00:20.310> than<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.580> layer

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
one layer of blue material than a layer

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.420 
one layer of blue material than a layer
of<00:00:21.000> red<00:00:21.270> material<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.740> colors<00:00:23.070> are<00:00:23.250> very

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
of red material and the colors are very

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.660 
of red material and the colors are very
strong<00:00:23.910> so<00:00:24.289> I<00:00:25.289> think<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:25.890> by<00:00:26.189> putting<00:00:26.460> the

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
strong so I think that by putting the

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.189 
strong so I think that by putting the
two<00:00:26.699> colors<00:00:27.240> together<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.660> then<00:00:27.900> layering

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
two colors together and then layering

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.169 
two colors together and then layering
the<00:00:28.529> black<00:00:28.740> material<00:00:29.340> over<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.550> top<00:00:29.849> it

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
the black material over the top it

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.089 
the black material over the top it
should<00:00:30.570> come<00:00:30.750> out<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:31.109> lot<00:00:31.380> more<00:00:31.650> opaque<00:00:32.040> than

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
should come out a lot more opaque than

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.700 
should come out a lot more opaque than
this<00:00:32.489> one<00:00:32.730> bit<00:00:35.780> now<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.840> machine<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.440> cutting

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
this one bit now the machine is cutting

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.799 
this one bit now the machine is cutting
the<00:00:38.070> groove<00:00:38.340> into<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.910> top<00:00:39.090> surface<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.629> the

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
the groove into the top surface of the

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.959 
the groove into the top surface of the
3d<00:00:40.140> printed<00:00:40.469> record<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:41.430> will<00:00:41.579> look<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.850> lot

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
3d printed record it will look a lot

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.580 
3d printed record it will look a lot
like<00:00:42.180> this<00:00:42.450> model<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:43.110> there's<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.350> groove

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
like this model so there's a groove

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.000 
like this model so there's a groove
going<00:00:43.950> all<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.670> way<00:00:44.700> around<00:00:45.620> this<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.770> fairly

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
going all the way around this is fairly

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.250 
going all the way around this is fairly
time-consuming<00:00:47.399> because<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.510> has<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.870> go<00:00:49.020> all

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
time-consuming because it has to go all

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.920 
time-consuming because it has to go all
the<00:00:49.320> way<00:00:49.739> around<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.660> circumference<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.840> the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
the way around the circumference of the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.799 
the way around the circumference of the
record<00:00:52.260> multiple<00:00:52.710> times<00:00:53.270> now<00:00:54.270> using<00:00:54.690> this

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
record multiple times now using this

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.450 
record multiple times now using this
light<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.289> can<00:00:55.440> see<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.680> groove<00:00:56.010> as<00:00:56.280> it's

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
light you can see the groove as it's

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.410 
light you can see the groove as it's
being<00:00:56.640> cut

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.940 

where's<00:01:01.420> the<00:01:01.510> cutter<00:01:01.750> as<00:01:01.990> it<00:01:02.140> approaches<00:01:02.650> and

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
where's the cutter as it approaches and

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.590 
where's the cutter as it approaches and
every<00:01:03.250> time<00:01:03.460> it<00:01:03.580> goes<00:01:03.700> past<00:01:04.059> there's<00:01:04.360> another

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
every time it goes past there's another

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:12.010 
every time it goes past there's another
groove<00:01:04.930> if<00:01:05.110> we<00:01:05.230> can<00:01:05.520> see<00:01:06.520> down<00:01:06.790> there

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.810 

now<00:01:13.020> it's<00:01:13.259> filling<00:01:13.649> in<00:01:13.799> smaller<00:01:14.520> groups

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
now it's filling in smaller groups

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:22.599 
now it's filling in smaller groups
between<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.600> groups<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:16.020> were<00:01:16.229> cut<00:01:16.439> earlier

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:22.609 

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:24.639 

gives<00:01:23.090> it<00:01:23.180> a<00:01:23.270> nice<00:01:23.420> healthy<00:01:23.750> appearance<00:01:24.350> of<00:01:24.530> a

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
gives it a nice healthy appearance of a

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:33.649 
gives it a nice healthy appearance of a
true<00:01:25.130> record<00:01:25.810> looks<00:01:26.810> like<00:01:27.020> it's<00:01:27.170> finishing<00:01:27.500> up

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.630 

be<00:01:34.020> winding<00:01:34.469> the<00:01:34.590> material<00:01:36.890> and<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:38.429> think

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
be winding the material and I think

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:48.070 
be winding the material and I think
there<00:01:38.880> we<00:01:39.030> go

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.850 

so<00:01:49.080> as<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.890> now<00:01:49.920> we<00:01:50.160> should<00:01:50.610> have<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:51.470> 3d<00:01:52.470> printed

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
so as of now we should have a 3d printed

00:01:52.860 --> 00:02:13.000 
so as of now we should have a 3d printed
model<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.400> phonograph<00:01:53.880> record

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.720 

peel<00:02:13.550> away<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.880> unused<00:02:14.450> material<00:02:15.520> punch<00:02:16.520> out

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
peel away the unused material punch out

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.809 
peel away the unused material punch out
the<00:02:16.910> center<00:02:17.349> and<00:02:18.349> it<00:02:18.980> looks<00:02:19.130> opaque<00:02:19.520> like<00:02:19.790> a

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
the center and it looks opaque like a

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.140 
the center and it looks opaque like a
record<00:02:20.330> has<00:02:21.040> grooves<00:02:22.040> running<00:02:22.610> around<00:02:22.700> like<00:02:23.090> a

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
record has grooves running around like a

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.620 
record has grooves running around like a
record

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
record

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.420 
record
nice<00:02:24.290> and<00:02:24.500> shiny<00:02:25.750> all<00:02:26.750> I<00:02:26.810> need<00:02:27.140> now<00:02:27.319> is<00:02:27.560> a<00:02:27.590> label

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
nice and shiny all I need now is a label

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.820 
nice and shiny all I need now is a label
and<00:02:28.640> it<00:02:28.760> will<00:02:28.910> look<00:02:29.060> like<00:02:29.270> a<00:02:29.510> record<00:02:29.989> except

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
and it will look like a record except

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.920 
and it will look like a record except
it's<00:02:31.010> just<00:02:31.250> a<00:02:31.370> 3d<00:02:31.730> printed<00:02:32.120> invitation

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
it's just a 3d printed invitation

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.449 
it's just a 3d printed invitation
I<00:02:33.370> wonder<00:02:34.370> what<00:02:34.550> song<00:02:34.940> it<00:02:35.150> will<00:02:35.209> play<00:02:36.459> don't

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
I wonder what song it will play don't

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.520 
I wonder what song it will play don't
don't<00:02:38.150> expect<00:02:38.540> this<00:02:38.720> to<00:02:38.780> sound<00:02:39.140> terribly

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
don't expect this to sound terribly

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.460 
don't expect this to sound terribly
pleasant<00:02:40.269> record<00:02:41.269> has<00:02:41.450> only<00:02:41.660> two<00:02:42.019> consecutive

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
pleasant record has only two consecutive

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.440 
pleasant record has only two consecutive
grooves<00:02:45.400> instead<00:02:46.400> of<00:02:46.489> the<00:02:46.580> usual<00:02:46.730> one<00:02:47.150> and

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
grooves instead of the usual one and

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:56.580 
grooves instead of the usual one and
they<00:02:47.600> are<00:02:47.690> made<00:02:48.200> for<00:02:48.470> cosmetic<00:02:49.100> purposes<00:02:49.280> only

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.860 

well<00:02:57.590> that<00:02:57.799> didn't<00:02:58.100> take<00:02:58.250> long

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:09.420 

let's<00:03:02.870> try<00:03:03.140> that<00:03:03.290> again
