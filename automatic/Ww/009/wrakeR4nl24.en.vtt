so hey guys it's mr. Danish and today

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.129 
so hey guys it's mr. Danish and today
we're<00:00:09.120> going<00:00:09.269> to<00:00:09.420> take<00:00:09.599> a<00:00:09.630> little<00:00:09.809> bit<00:00:09.929> how<00:00:10.080> to

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
we're going to take a little bit how to

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.440 
we're going to take a little bit how to
make<00:00:10.349> more<00:00:10.530> realistic<00:00:10.889> looking<00:00:11.309> mines<00:00:11.550> as<00:00:12.179> you

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
make more realistic looking mines as you

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.879 
make more realistic looking mines as you
can<00:00:12.599> see<00:00:12.750> this<00:00:12.960> is<00:00:13.110> probably<00:00:13.410> how<00:00:13.590> you<00:00:13.650> make

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
can see this is probably how you make

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.860 
can see this is probably how you make
your<00:00:14.009> minds<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.580> just<00:00:15.150> like<00:00:15.330> when<00:00:15.690> you

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
your minds and just like when you

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.380 
your minds and just like when you
playing<00:00:16.199> in<00:00:16.529> game<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.070> that's<00:00:17.970> fine<00:00:18.240> with<00:00:18.359> me

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
playing in game and that's fine with me

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.500 
playing in game and that's fine with me
actually<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:19.350> don't<00:00:19.650> mind<00:00:19.859> having<00:00:20.789> mines<00:00:21.330> to

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
actually I don't mind having mines to

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.439 
actually I don't mind having mines to
look<00:00:21.660> like<00:00:21.840> this<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.320> in<00:00:22.619> my<00:00:23.310> scenarios<00:00:23.760> but<00:00:24.050> I

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 
look like this and in my scenarios but I

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:29.779 
look like this and in my scenarios but I
got<00:00:27.449> another<00:00:27.689> option<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.650> way<00:00:29.460> cooler

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
got another option that is way cooler

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.870 
got another option that is way cooler
and<00:00:30.170> I'm<00:00:31.170> not<00:00:31.439> saying<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:32.520> should<00:00:32.730> only

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
and I'm not saying that you should only

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.000 
and I'm not saying that you should only
make<00:00:33.090> your<00:00:33.239> mines<00:00:33.480> like<00:00:33.660> like<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.469> because

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
make your mines like like that because

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.000 
make your mines like like that because
it<00:00:35.610> feels<00:00:35.880> quite<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.210> lot<00:00:36.420> but<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.380> could<00:00:37.590> be<00:00:37.739> you

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
it feels quite a lot but it could be you

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.760 
it feels quite a lot but it could be you
know<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.160> part<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.760> scenario<00:00:38.969> like<00:00:39.590> free<00:00:40.590> the

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
know a part of a scenario like free the

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.330 
know a part of a scenario like free the
prisoners<00:00:41.340> from<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:42.270> mines<00:00:42.540> or<00:00:42.870> something

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
prisoners from the mines or something

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.619 
prisoners from the mines or something
and<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.550> would<00:00:44.730> be<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:45.270> great<00:00:46.550> place<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.579> do<00:00:48.480> it

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
and that would be a great place to do it

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.439 
and that would be a great place to do it
so<00:00:49.170> anyway<00:00:49.500> I'll<00:00:50.070> just<00:00:50.340> show<00:00:50.520> um<00:00:50.820> let's<00:00:51.270> go

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
so anyway I'll just show um let's go

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.080 
so anyway I'll just show um let's go
make<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.660> clean<00:00:52.199> map<00:00:52.379> then<00:00:53.340> head<00:00:53.910> over<00:00:53.940> to

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
make a clean map then head over to

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.189 
make a clean map then head over to
terrains<00:00:54.570> map<00:00:55.050> oh<00:00:55.530> tap<00:00:56.160> sorry<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:57.140> go<00:00:58.140> to

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
terrains map oh tap sorry and go to

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.599 
terrains map oh tap sorry and go to
cliffs<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.859> make<00:00:59.100> something<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.579> looks

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
cliffs and make something that looks

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:06.469 
cliffs and make something that looks
like<00:00:59.910> this<00:01:00.410> and<00:01:01.410> then<00:01:02.160> just<00:01:04.159> make<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.189> circle<00:01:06.030> of

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
like this and then just make a circle of

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.399 
like this and then just make a circle of
some<00:01:06.720> sort<00:01:08.180> there's<00:01:09.180> no<00:01:09.330> right<00:01:09.540> or<00:01:09.570> wrong<00:01:09.720> of

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
some sort there's no right or wrong of

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.670 
some sort there's no right or wrong of
course<00:01:11.070> some<00:01:11.580> look<00:01:11.790> betters<00:01:12.439> better<00:01:13.439> than

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
course some look betters better than

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.450 
course some look betters better than
others<00:01:14.040> but<00:01:14.450> it's<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.659> matter<00:01:15.840> of

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.320

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
called map and now you're going to do

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.499 
called map and now you're going to do
some<00:01:30.040> terrain<00:01:30.250> mixing<00:01:30.610> all<00:01:31.060> right<00:01:31.270> I

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
some terrain mixing all right I

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.530 
some terrain mixing all right I
recommend<00:01:31.960> you<00:01:32.080> use<00:01:32.140> all<00:01:33.130> the<00:01:33.340> dirts<00:01:33.580> that<00:01:34.330> one

because<00:02:41.320> that's<00:02:41.530> something<00:02:41.650> you're<00:02:42.010> going<00:02:42.160> to

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
because that's something you're going to

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.910 
because that's something you're going to
place<00:02:42.459> a<00:02:42.489> lot<00:02:42.640> of<00:02:42.690> just<00:02:43.690> scatter<00:02:44.530> them<00:02:44.620> out

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
place a lot of just scatter them out

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.339 
place a lot of just scatter them out
like<00:02:45.310> this

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
like this

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.759 
like this
I<00:02:47.760> recommend<00:02:48.760> you<00:02:48.849> start<00:02:49.030> using<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:50.049> map<00:02:50.230> copy

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
I recommend you start using the map copy

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.119 
I recommend you start using the map copy
tool<00:02:51.040> at<00:02:51.310> some<00:02:51.459> point<00:02:52.439> so<00:02:53.439> you<00:02:53.500> can<00:02:53.680> place<00:02:53.950> them

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
tool at some point so you can place them

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:58.619 
tool at some point so you can place them
you<00:02:54.489> know<00:02:54.670> in<00:02:55.000> other<00:02:55.900> ways<00:02:57.299> went<00:02:58.299> different

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
you know in other ways went different

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:00.539 
you know in other ways went different
ways<00:02:58.810> but<00:02:59.109> for<00:02:59.680> now<00:02:59.769> this<00:03:00.010> will<00:03:00.219> do

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
ways but for now this will do

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.869 
ways but for now this will do
whoops<00:03:00.790> I'm<00:03:01.719> supposed<00:03:02.079> to<00:03:02.109> go<00:03:02.579> this<00:03:03.579> will<00:03:03.760> do

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
whoops I'm supposed to go this will do

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:08.490 
whoops I'm supposed to go this will do
and<00:03:05.340> yeah<00:03:06.540> just<00:03:07.540> make<00:03:07.720> sure<00:03:07.840> it's<00:03:07.989> mixed<00:03:08.049> in

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
and yeah just make sure it's mixed in

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.979 
and yeah just make sure it's mixed in
so<00:03:08.799> there's<00:03:09.250> small<00:03:09.579> spots<00:03:09.939> in<00:03:10.120> between<00:03:10.150> and

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
so there's small spots in between and

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.890 
so there's small spots in between and
now<00:03:11.260> place<00:03:11.709> your<00:03:11.739> minds<00:03:12.389> we'll<00:03:13.389> just<00:03:13.659> play

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
now place your minds we'll just play

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.179 
now place your minds we'll just play
some<00:03:15.269> stir<00:03:16.269> whines<00:03:16.510> don't<00:03:17.379> place<00:03:17.560> them<00:03:17.709> too

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:18.189 
some stir whines don't place them too

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:22.289 
some stir whines don't place them too
close<00:03:18.430> together<00:03:18.609> like<00:03:19.239> you<00:03:19.780> saw<00:03:19.989> before<00:03:21.299> not

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
close together like you saw before not

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:26.429 
close together like you saw before not
all<00:03:22.720> the<00:03:22.989> time<00:03:23.200> because<00:03:23.650> that<00:03:25.349> doesn't<00:03:26.349> look

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:26.439 
all the time because that doesn't look

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:27.539 
all the time because that doesn't look
good

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
good

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.589 
good
and<00:03:28.450> I'll<00:03:28.599> play<00:03:28.810> some<00:03:28.989> gold<00:03:29.200> mines<00:03:29.409> as<00:03:29.650> well<00:03:30.599> in

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
and I'll play some gold mines as well in

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.730 
and I'll play some gold mines as well in
between

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
between

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.800 
between
as<00:03:34.280> you<00:03:34.430> can<00:03:34.520> see<00:03:34.670> it<00:03:34.940> really<00:03:35.120> looks<00:03:35.270> like<00:03:35.540> it's

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
as you can see it really looks like it's

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.050 
as you can see it really looks like it's
a<00:03:35.900> part<00:03:36.110> of<00:03:36.140> the<00:03:36.290> rock<00:03:36.440> there<00:03:36.740> and<00:03:37.010> that's<00:03:37.850> what

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
a part of the rock there and that's what

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.650 
a part of the rock there and that's what
we<00:03:38.090> are<00:03:38.420> we're<00:03:38.840> going<00:03:39.080> for<00:03:39.460> so<00:03:40.460> it's<00:03:41.330> a<00:03:41.450> little

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
we are we're going for so it's a little

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.700 
we are we're going for so it's a little
hard<00:03:41.840> to<00:03:42.230> achieve<00:03:43.130> it<00:03:43.490> sometimes<00:03:44.450> but<00:03:44.780> if<00:03:45.500> you

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:45.710 
hard to achieve it sometimes but if you

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.010 
hard to achieve it sometimes but if you
use<00:03:45.830> the<00:03:45.980> map<00:03:46.130> cover<00:03:46.370> -<00:03:46.550> it's<00:03:46.730> much<00:03:46.910> easier<00:03:47.300> and

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
use the map cover - it's much easier and

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.350 
use the map cover - it's much easier and
you<00:03:48.170> can<00:03:48.290> always<00:03:48.410> just<00:03:48.770> do<00:03:48.920> the<00:03:49.160> thing<00:03:49.400> if<00:03:50.030> you

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
you can always just do the thing if you

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.780 
you can always just do the thing if you
mess<00:03:50.780> up<00:03:50.810> with<00:03:51.200> the<00:03:52.040> cliffs<00:03:52.340> you<00:03:52.520> can<00:03:52.670> always

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
mess up with the cliffs you can always

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.690 
mess up with the cliffs you can always
used<00:03:53.390> to<00:03:53.540> just<00:03:54.440> take<00:03:54.740> the<00:03:54.860> cliff<00:03:55.040> to<00:03:55.220> land<00:03:55.460> or

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
used to just take the cliff to land or

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.850 
used to just take the cliff to land or
write<00:03:56.030> it<00:03:56.210> -<00:03:56.480> repaired<00:03:56.840> and<00:03:57.050> you've

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
write it - repaired and you've

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.630 
write it - repaired and you've
successfully<00:03:58.610> map<00:03:59.420> copied<00:03:59.810> it<00:03:59.930> so<00:04:00.430> now<00:04:01.430> when

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
successfully map copied it so now when

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.810 
successfully map copied it so now when
you've<00:04:01.790> placed<00:04:02.330> all<00:04:02.450> the<00:04:02.540> minerals<00:04:03.260> I<00:04:03.800> like<00:04:04.640> to

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
you've placed all the minerals I like to

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.070 
you've placed all the minerals I like to
use<00:04:05.440> Dacians<00:04:06.440> building<00:04:07.070> style<00:04:07.810> I'll<00:04:08.810> just

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
use Dacians building style I'll just

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.310 
use Dacians building style I'll just
choose<00:04:09.500> playing<00:04:09.800> one<00:04:10.450> for<00:04:11.450> mining<00:04:11.840> camps<00:04:12.140> and

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
choose playing one for mining camps and

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.610 
choose playing one for mining camps and
then<00:04:12.770> place<00:04:13.280> one<00:04:13.310> or<00:04:13.670> two<00:04:13.820> depending<00:04:14.510> on<00:04:14.960> how

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
then place one or two depending on how

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.270 
then place one or two depending on how
big<00:04:15.860> you<00:04:16.010> are<00:04:16.040> -<00:04:16.940> I'll<00:04:17.330> just<00:04:17.900> place<00:04:18.799> one<00:04:18.830> for

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
big you are - I'll just place one for

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.370 
big you are - I'll just place one for
now<00:04:19.400> that's<00:04:19.640> fine<00:04:19.910> and<00:04:20.450> also<00:04:20.810> you<00:04:21.049> should<00:04:21.080> play

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
now that's fine and also you should play

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.190 
now that's fine and also you should play
some<00:04:21.590> villages<00:04:22.330> probably<00:04:23.330> males<00:04:23.570> you

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
some villages probably males you

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:31.390 
some villages probably males you
wouldn't<00:04:24.530> send<00:04:24.760> females<00:04:25.760> in<00:04:25.970> in<00:04:26.780> mines<00:04:28.480> so<00:04:30.400> use

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
wouldn't send females in in mines so use

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.050 
wouldn't send females in in mines so use
some<00:04:31.580> male<00:04:32.080> villages<00:04:33.080> and<00:04:33.490> you<00:04:34.490> can<00:04:34.820> perhaps

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
some male villages and you can perhaps

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.020 
some male villages and you can perhaps
add<00:04:35.390> a<00:04:35.630> you<00:04:36.590> know<00:04:36.740> a<00:04:36.950> samurai<00:04:37.460> would<00:04:37.670> be<00:04:37.850> good

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
add a you know a samurai would be good

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.730 
add a you know a samurai would be good
as<00:04:38.600> like<00:04:38.900> the<00:04:39.200> -<00:04:39.590> chief<00:04:39.970> of<00:04:40.970> this<00:04:41.530> mining<00:04:42.530> camp

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
as like the - chief of this mining camp

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.850 
as like the - chief of this mining camp
and<00:04:43.000> you<00:04:44.000> can<00:04:44.600> go<00:04:44.810> back<00:04:44.840> to<00:04:45.020> those<00:04:45.320> trappers

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
and you can go back to those trappers

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.130 
and you can go back to those trappers
play<00:04:46.100> a<00:04:46.130> guy<00:04:46.310> and<00:04:46.610> you<00:04:47.120> know<00:04:47.240> play<00:04:47.660> some<00:04:47.930> other

play a guy and you know play some other
stuff<00:04:49.130> like<00:04:49.430> crack<00:04:50.360> somewhere<00:04:50.920> you<00:04:51.920> never

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
stuff like crack somewhere you never

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.730 
stuff like crack somewhere you never
know<00:04:52.280> where<00:04:52.490> why<00:04:52.970> there's<00:04:53.300> a<00:04:53.360> crack<00:04:53.630> but<00:04:53.870> could

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
know where why there's a crack but could

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.020 
know where why there's a crack but could
be<00:04:54.890> a<00:04:54.920> crack<00:04:55.190> somewhere<00:04:55.660> and<00:04:56.680> holes<00:04:57.680> they<00:04:58.460> fit

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
be a crack somewhere and holes they fit

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.600 
be a crack somewhere and holes they fit
in<00:04:59.770> quite<00:05:00.770> nicely

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
in quite nicely

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.880 
in quite nicely
and<00:05:02.140> let's<00:05:03.140> see<00:05:03.320> I<00:05:03.530> like<00:05:04.490> to<00:05:04.700> add<00:05:05.300> some<00:05:05.890> trees

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 
and let's see I like to add some trees

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.280 
and let's see I like to add some trees
as<00:05:07.070> well<00:05:07.310> I<00:05:07.460> know<00:05:07.910> probably<00:05:08.420> isn't<00:05:09.050> that

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
as well I know probably isn't that

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.840 
as well I know probably isn't that
realistic<00:05:09.680> but<00:05:10.160> they<00:05:10.490> look<00:05:10.700> good<00:05:11.500> and<00:05:12.610> I<00:05:13.610> like

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
realistic but they look good and I like

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.750 
realistic but they look good and I like
to<00:05:13.970> use<00:05:14.120> pine<00:05:14.390> trees<00:05:15.040> of<00:05:16.040> course<00:05:16.340> it<00:05:16.460> depends

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
to use pine trees of course it depends

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.120 
to use pine trees of course it depends
on<00:05:16.940> the<00:05:17.870> area<00:05:18.020> if<00:05:18.290> there's<00:05:18.560> oak<00:05:18.740> tree<00:05:18.980> all

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
on the area if there's oak tree all

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.180 
on the area if there's oak tree all
around<00:05:19.460> it<00:05:19.610> that<00:05:19.640> probably<00:05:20.270> shouldn't<00:05:20.720> be

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
around it that probably shouldn't be

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.650 
around it that probably shouldn't be
pine<00:05:22.190> trees<00:05:22.430> down<00:05:22.610> here<00:05:22.820> but<00:05:23.060> I<00:05:23.240> still

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
pine trees down here but I still

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.810 
pine trees down here but I still
recommend<00:05:23.810> you<00:05:24.170> mix<00:05:24.380> all<00:05:24.650> kind<00:05:24.950> of<00:05:25.010> foresters

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
recommend you mix all kind of foresters

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.170 
recommend you mix all kind of foresters
forests<00:05:26.570> when<00:05:27.470> you<00:05:27.620> make<00:05:28.190> a<00:05:28.220> forest<00:05:28.610> so<00:05:29.000> it's

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
forests when you make a forest so it's

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.450 
forests when you make a forest so it's
not<00:05:29.330> pure<00:05:29.600> oak<00:05:29.870> so<00:05:30.410> also<00:05:30.710> make<00:05:30.860> some<00:05:30.980> pine

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
not pure oak so also make some pine

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.399 
not pure oak so also make some pine
trees<00:05:31.700> in<00:05:31.850> it<00:05:32.890> anyway<00:05:33.890> you<00:05:33.920> could

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:35.409 
trees in it anyway you could

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:37.589 
trees in it anyway you could
yeah<00:05:35.589> just<00:05:36.189> use<00:05:36.369> your<00:05:36.550> imagination<00:05:36.610> you<00:05:37.479> can

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:37.599 
yeah just use your imagination you can

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:41.549 
yeah just use your imagination you can
make<00:05:37.749> this<00:05:37.899> a<00:05:38.080> lot<00:05:38.349> bigger<00:05:38.619> you<00:05:39.610> could<00:05:40.559> you

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:41.559 
make this a lot bigger you could you

00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:42.959 
make this a lot bigger you could you
know<00:05:41.679> you<00:05:41.889> know<00:05:42.039> you<00:05:42.099> can<00:05:42.369> make<00:05:42.459> it<00:05:42.519> a<00:05:42.639> lot

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:42.969 
know you know you can make it a lot

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:44.850 
know you know you can make it a lot
bigger<00:05:43.179> and<00:05:43.330> like<00:05:43.659> place<00:05:44.110> a<00:05:44.139> townsend<00:05:44.709> or

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
bigger and like place a townsend or

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.729 
bigger and like place a townsend or
something<00:05:45.219> that<00:05:45.369> could<00:05:45.519> be<00:05:46.139> you<00:05:47.139> know<00:05:47.229> i<00:05:47.529> don't

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:47.739 
something that could be you know i don't

00:05:47.739 --> 00:05:49.709 
something that could be you know i don't
know<00:05:47.769> if<00:05:47.889> the<00:05:47.979> headquarter<00:05:48.459> of<00:05:48.489> the<00:05:48.819> evil<00:05:49.300> guys

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:49.719 
know if the headquarter of the evil guys

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:52.229 
know if the headquarter of the evil guys
who<00:05:49.989> captured<00:05:50.589> your<00:05:50.949> soldiers<00:05:51.699> and<00:05:51.879> used<00:05:52.089> in

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:52.239 
who captured your soldiers and used in

00:05:52.239 --> 00:05:54.209 
who captured your soldiers and used in
the<00:05:52.330> slaves<00:05:52.599> or<00:05:52.839> something<00:05:53.169> just<00:05:53.800> use<00:05:54.009> your

00:05:54.209 --> 00:05:54.219 
the slaves or something just use your

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:56.219 
the slaves or something just use your
imagination<00:05:54.389> you<00:05:55.389> could<00:05:55.479> also<00:05:55.629> make<00:05:55.929> a<00:05:55.959> river

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:56.229 
imagination you could also make a river

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:58.709 
imagination you could also make a river
go<00:05:56.469> through<00:05:57.069> to<00:05:57.339> mine<00:05:57.519> which<00:05:58.119> i<00:05:58.300> think<00:05:58.360> would

00:05:58.709 --> 00:05:58.719 
go through to mine which i think would

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:02.939 
go through to mine which i think would
be<00:05:58.779> awesome<00:05:59.499> because<00:06:00.839> you<00:06:01.839> know<00:06:02.379> when<00:06:02.739> they

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:02.949 
be awesome because you know when they

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:05.159 
be awesome because you know when they
you<00:06:03.639> know<00:06:03.669> in<00:06:03.879> old<00:06:04.209> times<00:06:04.419> when<00:06:04.599> they<00:06:04.779> looked

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:05.169 
you know in old times when they looked

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:07.259 
you know in old times when they looked
for<00:06:05.349> gold<00:06:05.529> they<00:06:06.099> you<00:06:06.399> know<00:06:06.519> take<00:06:06.909> something

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:07.269 
for gold they you know take something

00:06:07.269 --> 00:06:09.209 
for gold they you know take something
out<00:06:07.360> from<00:06:07.749> the<00:06:07.869> mine<00:06:08.050> and<00:06:08.079> washed<00:06:08.709> it<00:06:08.889> in<00:06:09.039> the

00:06:09.209 --> 00:06:09.219 
out from the mine and washed it in the

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:11.579 
out from the mine and washed it in the
river<00:06:09.550> to<00:06:09.849> see<00:06:09.999> if<00:06:10.059> there<00:06:10.269> was<00:06:10.360> gold<00:06:10.569> so<00:06:11.289> that

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:11.589 
river to see if there was gold so that

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:14.759 
river to see if there was gold so that
were<00:06:11.889> actually<00:06:12.279> quite<00:06:12.610> realistic<00:06:13.229> um<00:06:14.229> you

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:14.769 
were actually quite realistic um you

00:06:14.769 --> 00:06:17.399 
were actually quite realistic um you
could<00:06:14.860> also<00:06:15.009> add<00:06:15.219> some<00:06:15.429> plants<00:06:16.029> even<00:06:16.689> though<00:06:16.869> i

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:17.409 
could also add some plants even though i

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:19.649 
could also add some plants even though i
don't<00:06:17.979> recommend<00:06:18.369> using<00:06:18.759> the<00:06:19.059> big<00:06:19.239> plants

00:06:19.649 --> 00:06:19.659 
don't recommend using the big plants

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:21.239 
don't recommend using the big plants
like<00:06:19.989> the<00:06:20.169> smalls<00:06:20.439> would<00:06:20.649> be<00:06:20.800> okay

00:06:21.239 --> 00:06:21.249 
like the smalls would be okay

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:23.369 
like the smalls would be okay
you<00:06:21.369> know<00:06:21.489> nieta<00:06:21.819> rocks<00:06:22.089> but<00:06:22.569> i<00:06:22.779> wouldn't<00:06:23.349> use

00:06:23.369 --> 00:06:23.379 
you know nieta rocks but i wouldn't use

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:26.579 
you know nieta rocks but i wouldn't use
the<00:06:23.649> big<00:06:23.800> ones<00:06:24.389> because<00:06:25.389> that<00:06:25.899> doesn't<00:06:26.439> really

00:06:26.579 --> 00:06:26.589 
the big ones because that doesn't really

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:32.040 
the big ones because that doesn't really
make<00:06:26.769> sense<00:06:27.929> and<00:06:29.879> you<00:06:30.879> could<00:06:31.059> also<00:06:31.179> change<00:06:31.899> the

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.050 
make sense and you could also change the

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.699 
make sense and you could also change the
type<00:06:32.829> of<00:06:32.979> tree<00:06:33.309> to<00:06:34.269> be<00:06:34.449> at<00:06:34.659> that<00:06:34.899> kind<00:06:35.379> of<00:06:35.499> tree

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:35.709 
type of tree to be at that kind of tree

00:06:35.709 --> 00:06:37.969 
type of tree to be at that kind of tree
like<00:06:36.099> this<00:06:36.309> that<00:06:36.879> probably<00:06:37.059> makes<00:06:37.329> more<00:06:37.539> sense

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:37.979 
like this that probably makes more sense

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:42.089 
like this that probably makes more sense
so<00:06:38.979> just<00:06:39.909> think<00:06:40.449> realistically<00:06:40.800> use<00:06:41.800> the<00:06:41.949> map

00:06:42.089 --> 00:06:42.099 
so just think realistically use the map

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:46.679 
so just think realistically use the map
copy<00:06:42.339> tool<00:06:42.579> to<00:06:42.729> make<00:06:42.849> it<00:06:42.909> if<00:06:43.779> you<00:06:43.929> need<00:06:44.409> to<00:06:45.689> fit

00:06:46.679 --> 00:06:46.689 
copy tool to make it if you need to fit

00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:49.259 
copy tool to make it if you need to fit
more<00:06:46.869> into<00:06:47.139> a<00:06:47.769> little<00:06:48.159> space<00:06:48.399> also<00:06:48.999> use<00:06:49.119> the

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:49.269 
more into a little space also use the

00:06:49.269 --> 00:06:51.269 
more into a little space also use the
rotate<00:06:49.659> tool<00:06:49.899> if<00:06:50.379> you<00:06:50.499> have<00:06:50.529> too<00:06:50.860> many<00:06:50.979> of<00:06:51.099> the

00:06:51.269 --> 00:06:51.279 
rotate tool if you have too many of the

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:56.629 
rotate tool if you have too many of the
same<00:06:51.429> types<00:06:51.939> of<00:06:52.149> rocks<00:06:52.919> like<00:06:53.919> i<00:06:54.069> have<00:06:54.219> here<00:06:55.259> so

00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 
same types of rocks like i have here so

00:06:56.639 --> 00:07:01.109 
same types of rocks like i have here so
yes<00:06:57.639> just<00:06:57.909> your<00:06:58.319> imagination<00:06:59.319> and<00:07:00.119> please

00:07:01.109 --> 00:07:01.119 
yes just your imagination and please
