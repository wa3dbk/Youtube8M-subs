00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
flour so again very easy measurements to

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.520 
flour so again very easy measurements to
remember<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.390> goes<00:00:57.570> straight<00:00:57.780> into<00:00:58.379> our

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.620 

okay<00:01:36.040> so<00:01:36.100> obviously<00:01:36.490> you'll<00:01:36.850> have<00:01:37.000> ten<00:01:37.390> egg

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
okay so obviously you'll have ten egg

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.990 
okay so obviously you'll have ten egg
yolks<00:01:38.170> left<00:01:38.500> over<00:01:38.860> so<00:01:39.040> don't<00:01:39.280> throw<00:01:39.610> them<00:01:39.790> out

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
yolks left over so don't throw them out

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.360 
yolks left over so don't throw them out

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.370 
make an ice cream with it or a custard

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.190 
make an ice cream with it or a custard
even<00:01:43.000> a<00:01:43.090> source<00:01:43.480> like<00:01:43.660> a<00:01:43.690> hollandaise<00:01:44.170> sauce

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
even a source like a hollandaise sauce

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.500 
even a source like a hollandaise sauce
would<00:01:44.530> be<00:01:44.590> fantastic<00:01:44.800> so<00:01:45.640> just<00:01:45.850> add<00:01:46.000> these<00:01:46.300> egg

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
whites to the dry ingredients so that's

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.070

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
the wet ingredients three hundred and

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.360 
the wet ingredients three hundred and
sixty<00:01:55.420> grams<00:01:55.690> of<00:01:55.990> butter<00:01:56.200> I've<00:01:56.590> just<00:01:56.920> melted

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
sixty grams of butter I've just melted

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
sixty grams of butter I've just melted
it<00:01:57.490> and<00:01:58.080> again<00:01:59.080> we're<00:01:59.290> going<00:01:59.440> to<00:01:59.530> slowly<00:02:00.390> pull

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390

that<00:02:01.540> in<00:02:06.119> all<00:02:07.119> right<00:02:07.300> so<00:02:07.660> that's<00:02:08.320> the<00:02:08.470> rest<00:02:08.830> of

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
that in all right so that's the rest of
