00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.800 
changes that could be made in materials
and<00:02:22.350> in<00:02:23.340> some<00:02:23.550> construction<00:02:24.120> techniques<00:02:24.570> that

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
and in some construction techniques that

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.110 
and in some construction techniques that
would<00:02:24.900> get<00:02:25.050> us<00:02:25.170> a<00:02:25.290> whole<00:02:25.500> lot<00:02:25.530> closer<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:27.000> what

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
would get us a whole lot closer to what

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.510 
would get us a whole lot closer to what
South<00:02:27.390> LA<00:02:27.540> was<00:02:27.690> original<00:02:28.140> intent<00:02:28.470> was<00:02:28.530> so
