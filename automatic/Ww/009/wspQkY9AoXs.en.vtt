on the skis I board all four holes out
to<00:02:07.250> a<00:02:07.310> much<00:02:07.550> larger<00:02:07.730> side<00:02:08.180> you<00:02:08.660> want<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:08.990> bolts

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:09.260 
to a much larger side you want the bolts

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.580 
to a much larger side you want the bolts
to<00:02:09.440> slide<00:02:09.649> in<00:02:09.920> and<00:02:10.220> out<00:02:10.310> very<00:02:10.670> easily

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
to slide in and out very easily

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.020 
to slide in and out very easily
especially<00:02:12.590> when<00:02:12.770> you're<00:02:12.890> out<00:02:12.920> on<00:02:13.040> a<00:02:13.190> cold<00:02:13.760> day

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
especially when you're out on a cold day

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.650 
especially when you're out on a cold day
i<00:02:15.460> mounted<00:02:16.460> rings<00:02:16.730> on<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.060> outside<00:02:17.480> of<00:02:17.600> the

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
i mounted rings on the outside of the

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.820 
i mounted rings on the outside of the
board<00:02:18.190> so<00:02:19.190> that<00:02:19.220> I<00:02:19.370> could<00:02:19.610> touch<00:02:20.530> bungee<00:02:21.530> cords

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
board so that I could touch bungee cords

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.720 
board so that I could touch bungee cords
down<00:02:22.010> or<00:02:22.310> other<00:02:22.460> straps<00:02:24.250> then<00:02:25.250> this<00:02:25.430> to<00:02:25.580> all

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
down or other straps then this to all

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.690 
down or other straps then this to all
four<00:02:26.030> boards

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.280 

next<00:02:30.700> I<00:02:30.820> put<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.150> eyelets<00:02:31.690> in<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:31.960> front<00:02:32.230> of

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
next I put the eyelets in the front of

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.160 
next I put the eyelets in the front of
the<00:02:32.380> skis<00:02:32.710> and<00:02:33.130> I<00:02:33.880> painted<00:02:34.270> the<00:02:34.600> crossbeams

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
the skis and I painted the crossbeams

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.160 
the skis and I painted the crossbeams
different<00:02:35.740> colors<00:02:36.010> at<00:02:36.250> each<00:02:36.400> location<00:02:37.140> so<00:02:38.140> I

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
different colors at each location so I

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.380 
different colors at each location so I
can<00:02:38.440> easily<00:02:38.800> tell<00:02:39.040> which<00:02:39.280> board<00:02:39.670> goes<00:02:40.150> what

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
can easily tell which board goes what

00:02:40.390 --> 00:03:10.050 
can easily tell which board goes what
direction<00:03:07.740> well<00:03:08.740> it's<00:03:08.920> 38<00:03:09.400> degrees<00:03:09.760> here<00:03:10.030> in

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
direction well it's 38 degrees here in

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.730 
direction well it's 38 degrees here in
the<00:03:10.150> garage<00:03:10.390> so<00:03:10.660> there's<00:03:11.320> a<00:03:11.350> little<00:03:11.560> chilly

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
the garage so there's a little chilly

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.890 
the garage so there's a little chilly

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
put them on the bottom of the skis so

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.910 
put them on the bottom of the skis so
