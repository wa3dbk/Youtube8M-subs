where<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.140> stitch<00:02:06.380> is<00:02:06.530> going<00:02:06.890> to<00:02:07.010> be<00:02:07.130> this

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
where the stitch is going to be this

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.910 
where the stitch is going to be this
will<00:02:08.060> help<00:02:08.360> us<00:02:08.539> to<00:02:08.690> create<00:02:09.020> the<00:02:09.229> volume<00:02:09.380> effect

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
will help us to create the volume effect

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.190 
will help us to create the volume effect
later<00:02:10.610> on<00:02:10.850> now<00:02:11.420> I'm<00:02:11.510> gonna<00:02:11.630> take<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:11.990> black

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
later on now I'm gonna take the black

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.690 
later on now I'm gonna take the black
and<00:02:12.230> a<00:02:12.560> sec<00:02:12.740> creating<00:02:13.100> the<00:02:13.250> lines<00:02:13.459> of<00:02:13.610> the

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
and a sec creating the lines of the

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.240 
and a sec creating the lines of the
wounds<00:02:14.090> fill<00:02:14.660> in<00:02:14.780> some<00:02:15.050> areas<00:02:15.590> like<00:02:15.800> we<00:02:16.100> will

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
wounds fill in some areas like we will

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.699 
wounds fill in some areas like we will
be<00:02:16.400> open<00:02:16.760> wounds<00:02:17.150> just<00:02:17.900> in<00:02:18.080> some<00:02:18.230> areas<00:02:18.590> not

be open wounds just in some areas not
all<00:02:18.920> over<00:02:19.250> it<00:02:19.400> because<00:02:19.580> we<00:02:19.760> want<00:02:19.940> to<00:02:20.030> just

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
all over it because we want to just

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
all over it because we want to just
specific<00:02:20.560> intent<00:02:21.560> effects<00:02:22.690> take<00:02:23.690> the<00:02:24.020> brown

specific intent effects take the brown

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.020 
specific intent effects take the brown
from<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.680> same<00:02:24.890> palette<00:02:25.160> when<00:02:25.730> you're<00:02:25.850> only

areas the open wounds areas the thicker
part<00:02:31.430> to<00:02:32.209> create<00:02:32.420> some<00:02:32.810> volume<00:02:33.020> we<00:02:33.890> will<00:02:34.040> also

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
part to create some volume we will also

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.949 
part to create some volume we will also
add<00:02:34.520> a<00:02:34.550> little<00:02:34.880> bit<00:02:35.060> in<00:02:35.180> inner<00:02:35.480> part<00:02:35.840> of<00:02:35.900> the

add a little bit in inner part of the
mouth<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:36.410> then<00:02:37.040> we're<00:02:37.190> gonna<00:02:37.310> move<00:02:37.520> to<00:02:37.700> the

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
mouth and then we're gonna move to the

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.610 
mouth and then we're gonna move to the
red<00:02:38.000> and<00:02:38.239> they<00:02:38.360> start<00:02:38.630> playing<00:02:38.840> like<00:02:39.200> a<00:02:39.230> little

red and they start playing like a little
bit<00:02:39.709> more<00:02:39.890> bloody<00:02:40.310> effect<00:02:40.880> on<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.720> open<00:02:41.989> areas

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
bit more bloody effect on the open areas

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.920 
bit more bloody effect on the open areas
winds<00:02:42.950> thicker<00:02:43.670> ports<00:02:44.120> and<00:02:44.360> also<00:02:44.510> some

touches on the thinner sports now back

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.870 
touches on the thinner sports now back
to<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:48.709> black<00:02:48.920> we're<00:02:49.190> gonna<00:02:49.280> start<00:02:49.580> creating

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
to the black we're gonna start creating

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.300 
to the black we're gonna start creating
the<00:02:50.180> basis<00:02:50.630> of<00:02:50.780> our<00:02:50.989> stitches<00:02:51.590> so<00:02:52.070> we're<00:02:52.220> gonna

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
the basis of our stitches so we're gonna

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.690 
the basis of our stitches so we're gonna
create<00:02:52.670> dots<00:02:53.030> in<00:02:53.840> either<00:02:54.320> side<00:02:54.680> of<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.310> skin

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
create dots in either side of the skin

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.360 
create dots in either side of the skin
wounds<00:02:56.030> and<00:02:56.440> we're<00:02:57.440> gonna<00:02:57.560> do<00:02:57.830> it<00:02:57.950> in<00:02:58.010> the<00:02:58.160> Sun

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
wounds and we're gonna do it in the Sun

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.880 
wounds and we're gonna do it in the Sun
level<00:02:58.760> but<00:02:59.120> we<00:02:59.330> can<00:02:59.600> twist<00:03:00.230> it<00:03:00.470> around<00:03:00.560> a

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
level but we can twist it around a

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.380 
level but we can twist it around a
little<00:03:01.040> bit<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.430> stitches<00:03:01.880> to<00:03:01.910> create<00:03:02.180> a

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
little bit the stitches to create a

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.140 
little bit the stitches to create a
little<00:03:02.540> more<00:03:02.840> I'll<00:03:03.560> fold<00:03:03.980> down<00:03:04.310> stitches<00:03:04.970> and

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
little more I'll fold down stitches and

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.270 
little more I'll fold down stitches and
stuff<00:03:05.450> like<00:03:05.690> that<00:03:05.900> we're<00:03:06.590> gonna<00:03:06.680> connect<00:03:07.160> the

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
stuff like that we're gonna connect the

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.240 
stuff like that we're gonna connect the
dots<00:03:07.549> creating<00:03:08.239> a<00:03:08.420> curved<00:03:08.989> line<00:03:09.080> to<00:03:09.980> create

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
dots creating a curved line to create

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.289 
dots creating a curved line to create
more<00:03:10.400> 3d<00:03:10.850> effect<00:03:12.549> and<00:03:13.549> now<00:03:13.670> you're<00:03:13.850> gonna<00:03:13.970> see

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
more 3d effect and now you're gonna see

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.570 
more 3d effect and now you're gonna see
if<00:03:14.510> you<00:03:14.870> have<00:03:15.170> if<00:03:15.470> we<00:03:15.620> have<00:03:15.799> create<00:03:16.190> a<00:03:16.220> little

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
if you have if we have create a little

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.320 
if you have if we have create a little
more<00:03:16.930> felt<00:03:17.930> our<00:03:18.290> front<00:03:18.890> twist<00:03:19.190> around<00:03:19.430> type<00:03:20.030> of

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
more felt our front twist around type of

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.920 
more felt our front twist around type of
stitches<00:03:20.750> look<00:03:21.110> a<00:03:21.290> little<00:03:21.470> more<00:03:21.709> natural<00:03:22.930> once

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
stitches look a little more natural once

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.500 
stitches look a little more natural once
we<00:03:24.140> have<00:03:24.320> this<00:03:24.470> done<00:03:24.680> then<00:03:25.459> I<00:03:25.670> go<00:03:25.880> back<00:03:25.910> to<00:03:26.420> the

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
we have this done then I go back to the

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.300 
we have this done then I go back to the
brown<00:03:26.750> and<00:03:26.959> start<00:03:27.200> creating<00:03:27.410> the<00:03:28.040> most

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
brown and start creating the most

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.069 
brown and start creating the most
important<00:03:28.880> part<00:03:29.150> of<00:03:29.239> this<00:03:29.360> makeup<00:03:29.630> which<00:03:30.049> is

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
important part of this makeup which is

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.949 
important part of this makeup which is
the<00:03:30.440> volume<00:03:31.000> start<00:03:32.000> applying<00:03:32.329> this<00:03:32.600> Brown

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
the volume start applying this Brown

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.100 
the volume start applying this Brown
between<00:03:33.799> the<00:03:33.920> stitches<00:03:34.220> and<00:03:34.730> never<00:03:35.720> getting

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
between the stitches and never getting

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.819 
between the stitches and never getting
too<00:03:36.590> close<00:03:37.010> to<00:03:37.610> the<00:03:37.760> line<00:03:38.060> of<00:03:38.090> the<00:03:38.360> wound<00:03:38.739> so<00:03:39.739> as

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
too close to the line of the wound so as

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:41.860 
too close to the line of the wound so as
you<00:03:39.950> can<00:03:40.070> see<00:03:40.310> we<00:03:40.489> have<00:03:40.700> some<00:03:40.970> kind<00:03:41.269> of<00:03:41.480> white

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
you can see we have some kind of white

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.410 
you can see we have some kind of white
area<00:03:42.530> around<00:03:43.010> the<00:03:43.220> wound<00:03:43.459> and<00:03:43.670> the<00:03:43.940> stitches

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
area around the wound and the stitches

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.870 
area around the wound and the stitches
and<00:03:44.600> then<00:03:44.810> it<00:03:44.959> comes<00:03:45.200> to<00:03:45.350> brown<00:03:45.620> which<00:03:46.370> we<00:03:46.640> will

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
and then it comes to brown which we will

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.180 
and then it comes to brown which we will
really<00:03:47.269> blend<00:03:47.630> out<00:03:47.989> into<00:03:49.180> like<00:03:50.180> a<00:03:50.209> more

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
really blend out into like a more

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.100 
really blend out into like a more
integrated<00:03:52.190> area<00:03:52.579> that<00:03:52.970> will<00:03:53.150> give<00:03:53.450> us<00:03:53.480> a<00:03:53.750> very

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
integrated area that will give us a very

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.180 
integrated area that will give us a very
very<00:03:55.010> realistic<00:03:55.880> 3d<00:03:56.510> volume<00:03:57.140> effect<00:03:57.500> and<00:03:57.799> to

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
very realistic 3d volume effect and to

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.819 
very realistic 3d volume effect and to
the<00:03:58.310> stitches<00:03:58.790> and<00:03:59.060> into<00:03:59.329> this<00:03:59.480> type<00:04:00.230> of<00:04:00.440> part

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
the stitches and into this type of part

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:04.340
