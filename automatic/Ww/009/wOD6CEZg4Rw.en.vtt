few different lenses inside it as you

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.180 
few different lenses inside it as you
adjust<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.690> distance<00:00:40.230> between<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.739> lens<00:00:40.860> and

the subject the image comes into focus

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.160 
the subject the image comes into focus
but<00:00:44.370> there's<00:00:44.670> only<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.000> close<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.809> can<00:00:45.960> get

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
but there's only so close you can get

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.650 
but there's only so close you can get
before<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.950> image<00:00:47.219> gets<00:00:47.700> out<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:47.940> focus<00:00:48.329> a

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
few options for you to magnify your

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.679 
few options for you to magnify your
image<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:05.250> first<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:06.060> get<00:01:06.210> another<00:01:06.390> lens

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
image the first is to get another lens

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.450 
image the first is to get another lens
now<00:01:07.049> there<00:01:07.200> are<00:01:07.290> hundreds<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:07.950> options<00:01:08.310> out

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
now there are hundreds of options out

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.580 
now there are hundreds of options out
there<00:01:08.640> for<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.939> try<00:01:09.180> before<00:01:09.750> long<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.470> can

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
there for you to try before long it can

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.590 
there for you to try before long it can
start<00:01:10.860> getting<00:01:11.130> pretty<00:01:11.430> expensive<00:01:11.909> so<00:01:12.270> we're

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
start getting pretty expensive so we're

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.210 
start getting pretty expensive so we're
going<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.780> show<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.110> few<00:01:13.380> cheaper<00:01:13.830> options

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
going to show you a few cheaper options

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.800 
going to show you a few cheaper options
the<00:01:14.520> first<00:01:14.549> thing<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:14.909> can<00:01:15.000> try<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.509> putting

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
the first thing you can try is putting

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.810 
the first thing you can try is putting
your<00:01:15.900> lens<00:01:16.140> on<00:01:16.380> backwards<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.490> might<00:01:17.670> sound

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
your lens on backwards it might sound

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.070 
your lens on backwards it might sound
like<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.000> strange<00:01:18.119> thing<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.570> do<00:01:18.780> but<00:01:18.960> it

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
like a strange thing to do but it

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.539 
like a strange thing to do but it
actually<00:01:19.380> works<00:01:19.590> pretty<00:01:19.680> well<00:01:20.040> because

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
actually works pretty well because

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.090 
actually works pretty well because
normally<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.240> lens<00:01:21.479> allows<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.380> focus<00:01:22.590> on<00:01:22.890> a

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
normally a lens allows you to focus on a

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.070 
normally a lens allows you to focus on a
big<00:01:23.340> object<00:01:23.520> that's<00:01:24.060> far<00:01:24.299> away<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.780> make<00:01:25.049> it

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
big object that's far away and make it

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.289 
big object that's far away and make it
look<00:01:25.320> much<00:01:25.530> smaller<00:01:25.890> by<00:01:26.640> turning<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.180> lens

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
look much smaller by turning the lens

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.510 
look much smaller by turning the lens
around<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:28.080> can<00:01:28.229> do<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.409> opposite<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.340> you're

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
around you can do the opposite so you're

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.370 
around you can do the opposite so you're
able<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.790> look<00:01:30.000> at<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.270> small<00:01:30.479> object<00:01:30.990> that's<00:01:31.229> up

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
able to look at a small object that's up

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.770 
able to look at a small object that's up
close<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:32.009> make<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.310> appear<00:01:32.610> much<00:01:32.850> bigger<00:01:33.119> so

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
close and make it appear much bigger so

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.050 
close and make it appear much bigger so
all<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.049> need<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.439> reverse<00:01:35.009> lens<00:01:35.430> adapter

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
all you need is a reverse lens adapter

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.510 
all you need is a reverse lens adapter
which<00:01:36.450> goes<00:01:36.689> between<00:01:36.930> your<00:01:37.320> camera<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.920> the

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
which goes between your camera and the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.580 
which goes between your camera and the
filter<00:01:38.850> thread<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.329> your<00:01:39.570> lens<00:01:39.720> alternatively

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
filter thread of your lens alternatively

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.590 
filter thread of your lens alternatively
you<00:01:40.799> can<00:01:41.009> move<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.400> lens<00:01:41.579> further<00:01:42.180> away<00:01:42.570> from

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
you can move the lens further away from

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.230 
you can move the lens further away from
the<00:01:43.020> camera<00:01:43.350> sensor<00:01:43.590> now<00:01:44.310> doing<00:01:44.700> this<00:01:44.850> allows

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
the camera sensor now doing this allows

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.389 
the camera sensor now doing this allows
you<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.479> get<00:01:45.630> an<00:01:45.750> object<00:01:46.229> much<00:01:46.680> closer<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.310> the

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
you to get an object much closer to the

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.760 
you to get an object much closer to the
lens<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.880> still<00:01:48.420> have<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.689> in<00:01:48.810> focus<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.409> we

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
lens and still have it in focus so we

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.710 
lens and still have it in focus so we
can<00:01:49.950> do<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.220> using<00:01:50.430> this<00:01:50.970> series<00:01:51.270> of<00:01:51.390> barrel

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
can do that using this series of barrel

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.590 
can do that using this series of barrel
extenders<00:01:52.229> now<00:01:52.950> these<00:01:53.100> things<00:01:53.310> are<00:01:53.640> cheap<00:01:54.060> but

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
extenders now these things are cheap but

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.359 
extenders now these things are cheap but
they<00:01:54.689> do<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.960> job<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.619> they're<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.799> best<00:01:55.950> 15

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
they do the job and they're the best 15

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.249 
they do the job and they're the best 15
pounds<00:01:56.670> you've<00:01:56.820> ever<00:01:56.939> spent<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.810> last<00:01:57.990> option

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
pounds you've ever spent the last option

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.410 
pounds you've ever spent the last option
is<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.619> use<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.979> second<00:01:59.520> lens<00:01:59.670> in<00:01:59.969> front<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.329> the

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
is to use a second lens in front of the

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.030 
is to use a second lens in front of the
first<00:02:00.570> one<00:02:00.869> this<00:02:01.290> is<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.500> little<00:02:01.770> bit<00:02:01.860> like

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
first one this is a little bit like

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.520 
first one this is a little bit like
holding<00:02:02.490> up<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.729> magnifying<00:02:03.270> glass<00:02:03.540> now<00:02:04.469> you

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
holding up a magnifying glass now you

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.590 
holding up a magnifying glass now you
can<00:02:04.890> use<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.280> coupling<00:02:05.729> ring<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.119> fix<00:02:06.360> two

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
can use a coupling ring to fix two

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.449 
can use a coupling ring to fix two
lenses<00:02:06.960> together<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.530> have<00:02:07.799> one<00:02:08.009> in<00:02:08.039> reverse

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
lenses together and have one in reverse

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.940 
lenses together and have one in reverse
or<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:09.330> can<00:02:09.450> do<00:02:09.629> away<00:02:09.720> with<00:02:09.810> all<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:10.619> and

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
or you can do away with all of that and

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.309 
or you can do away with all of that and
use<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.760> camera<00:02:12.060> from<00:02:12.330> your<00:02:12.420> phone

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.110 
use the camera from your phone
an<00:02:13.409> old<00:02:13.620> laser<00:02:13.950> pointer<00:02:14.459> if<00:02:14.670> you<00:02:14.819> take<00:02:14.999> apart

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
an old laser pointer if you take apart

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.509 
an old laser pointer if you take apart
the<00:02:15.329> laser<00:02:15.480> pointer<00:02:15.959> inside<00:02:16.709> will<00:02:16.920> be<00:02:16.950> a<00:02:17.040> tiny

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
the laser pointer inside will be a tiny

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.849 
the laser pointer inside will be a tiny
lens<00:02:17.849> like<00:02:18.150> this<00:02:18.389> one<00:02:18.569> all<00:02:19.049> we<00:02:19.260> have<00:02:19.409> to<00:02:19.560> do<00:02:19.680> is

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:19.859 
lens like this one all we have to do is

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:21.860 
lens like this one all we have to do is
fix<00:02:20.129> this<00:02:20.430> lens<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.299> front<00:02:21.540> of<00:02:21.659> the<00:02:21.749> lens

of the camera on your phone to do this

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:25.729 
of the camera on your phone to do this
we've<00:02:24.389> used<00:02:24.659> a<00:02:24.749> ring<00:02:24.900> of<00:02:25.019> plasticine<00:02:25.560> and

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
we've used a ring of plasticine and

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.709 
we've used a ring of plasticine and
voila<00:02:26.280> it's<00:02:26.790> as<00:02:26.879> simple<00:02:27.060> as<00:02:27.329> that

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:27.719 
voila it's as simple as that

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:29.639 
the image is magnified and we can take

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:32.390 
the image is magnified and we can take
some<00:02:30.000> macro<00:02:30.480> photos<00:02:30.989> try<00:02:31.829> this<00:02:31.889> for<00:02:32.129> yourself
