00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
number two hit level cycle we're gonna

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.410 
number two hit level cycle we're gonna
do<00:00:32.619> outside<00:00:32.980> profiling<00:00:33.580> we're<00:00:34.239> going<00:00:34.360> to

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
do outside profiling we're going to

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.299 
do outside profiling we're going to
profile<00:00:34.750> towards<00:00:35.050> the<00:00:35.140> headstock<00:00:35.559> we're

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:36.309 
profile towards the headstock we're

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:37.740 
profile towards the headstock we're
going<00:00:36.430> to<00:00:36.489> do<00:00:36.580> straight<00:00:36.970> cuts<00:00:37.330> and<00:00:37.629> then

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
going to do straight cuts and then

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.189 
going to do straight cuts and then
profile<00:00:38.170> finish<00:00:38.559> cuts<00:00:39.360> okay<00:00:40.360> so<00:00:40.420> now<00:00:40.840> we<00:00:40.900> want

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:41.199 
profile finish cuts okay so now we want

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:43.740 
profile finish cuts okay so now we want
to<00:00:41.260> give<00:00:41.530> it<00:00:41.650> a<00:00:41.920> number<00:00:42.550> and<00:00:42.760> then<00:00:43.120> hit<00:00:43.180> recall

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
to give it a number and then hit recall

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.450 
to give it a number and then hit recall
that's<00:00:44.260> going<00:00:44.500> to<00:00:44.559> take<00:00:44.710> us<00:00:44.830> to<00:00:44.980> the<00:00:45.070> profile

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
that's going to take us to the profile

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.160 
that's going to take us to the profile
editor<00:00:45.910> this<00:00:46.090> is<00:00:46.150> where<00:00:46.420> we<00:00:46.510> actually<00:00:46.629> draw<00:00:47.050> on

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
editor this is where we actually draw on

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.100 
editor this is where we actually draw on
the<00:00:47.260> machine<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.850> create<00:00:49.030> the<00:00:49.360> profile<00:00:49.870> of<00:00:49.900> the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110 
the machine to create the profile of the

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.549 
the machine to create the profile of the
part<00:00:50.379> so<00:00:51.129> let's<00:00:51.160> go<00:00:51.430> edit<00:00:51.750> profile<00:00:52.750> it's<00:00:53.409> going

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
part so let's go edit profile it's going

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:54.660 
part so let's go edit profile it's going
to<00:00:53.650> ask<00:00:53.739> you<00:00:53.800> for<00:00:53.920> our<00:00:54.010> initial<00:00:54.159> coordinate

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
to ask you for our initial coordinate

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.969 
to ask you for our initial coordinate
which<00:00:54.790> is<00:00:54.820> going<00:00:55.000> to<00:00:55.059> be<00:00:55.150> 0<00:00:55.390> 0<00:00:55.449> validate<00:00:56.409> it

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:56.979 
which is going to be 0 0 validate it

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:58.680 
which is going to be 0 0 validate it
gives<00:00:57.220> us<00:00:57.309> our<00:00:57.460> gqo<00:00:57.820> coordinate<00:00:58.300> for<00:00:58.540> that

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
gives us our gqo coordinate for that

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.899 
gives us our gqo coordinate for that
start<00:00:59.170> point<00:00:59.530> then<00:01:00.400> we<00:01:00.519> want<00:01:00.699> to<00:01:00.760> do<00:01:00.879> a

that's<00:01:53.680> got<00:01:53.830> our<00:01:53.950> profile<00:01:54.370> ok<00:01:55.120> now<00:01:55.270> we<00:01:55.330> want<00:01:55.480> to

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
that's got our profile ok now we want to

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.390 
that's got our profile ok now we want to
go<00:01:55.690> and<00:01:55.870> put<00:01:55.990> radiuses<00:01:56.560> of<00:01:56.590> each<00:01:56.950> one<00:01:57.190> of<00:01:57.310> those

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
go and put radiuses of each one of those

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.640 
go and put radiuses of each one of those
corners<00:01:57.700> so<00:01:58.540> you<00:01:58.570> come<00:01:58.990> in<00:01:59.140> here<00:01:59.290> and<00:01:59.440> you<00:01:59.500> go

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
corners so you come in here and you go

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.390 
corners so you come in here and you go
to<00:01:59.710> where<00:01:59.890> it<00:01:59.950> says<00:02:00.070> corners<00:02:01.050> rounding<00:02:02.400> this

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
to where it says corners rounding this

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.790 
to where it says corners rounding this
is<00:02:03.550> our<00:02:03.670> first<00:02:04.290> intersection<00:02:05.290> where<00:02:05.590> we<00:02:05.650> can

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
is our first intersection where we can

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.380 
is our first intersection where we can
put<00:02:05.950> a<00:02:05.980> radius<00:02:06.490> so<00:02:06.700> let's<00:02:06.880> go

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
put a radius so let's go

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.869 
put a radius so let's go
hundred<00:02:07.900> thousands<00:02:08.319> right<00:02:08.440> here<00:02:08.729> next<00:02:09.729> one

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:09.879 
hundred thousands right here next one

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:13.559 
hundred thousands right here next one
let's<00:02:10.149> go<00:02:10.300> to<00:02:10.330> hundred<00:02:10.929> thousandths

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.589 

we<00:02:13.930> can<00:02:14.110> do<00:02:14.230> another<00:02:14.970> 200<00:02:15.970> thousands<00:02:16.390> here<00:02:16.480> if

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
we can do another 200 thousands here if

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.509 
we can do another 200 thousands here if
we<00:02:16.690> want<00:02:16.959> let's<00:02:17.170> just<00:02:17.230> use<00:02:17.920> the<00:02:18.099> tool<00:02:18.310> range

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
we want let's just use the tool range

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.190 
we want let's just use the tool range
for<00:02:18.730> that<00:02:18.879> one<00:02:19.060> so<00:02:19.209> we'll<00:02:19.330> skip<00:02:19.540> that<00:02:19.720> one<00:02:19.780> hit

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
for that one so we'll skip that one hit

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.530 
for that one so we'll skip that one hit
next<00:02:20.500> element<00:02:20.920> we'll<00:02:21.670> move<00:02:21.819> on<00:02:22.000> to<00:02:22.120> this<00:02:22.269> one

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
next element we'll move on to this one

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.160 
next element we'll move on to this one
let's<00:02:22.930> go<00:02:23.370> do<00:02:24.370> a<00:02:24.640> thirty<00:02:25.390> thousand<00:02:25.989> right

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
let's go do a thirty thousand right

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.820 
let's go do a thirty thousand right
there<00:02:27.090> that's<00:02:28.090> it<00:02:28.330> so<00:02:29.260> now<00:02:29.349> we<00:02:29.410> want<00:02:29.590> to<00:02:29.680> state

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
there that's it so now we want to state

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:36.140 
there that's it so now we want to state
this<00:02:30.720> to<00:02:31.720> finish<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.410> give<00:02:32.590> it<00:02:32.709> a<00:02:32.830> name
