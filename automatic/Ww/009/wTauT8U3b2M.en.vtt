the standard size works I often find

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.300 
the standard size works I often find
myself<00:01:27.900> moving<00:01:28.259> back<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.710> this<00:01:28.829> one<00:01:29.040> just

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
myself moving back to this one just

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.620 
myself moving back to this one just
because<00:01:29.430> it's<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.729> bit<00:01:29.909> more<00:01:30.090> comfortable<00:01:30.299> to

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
because it's a bit more comfortable to

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.469 
because it's a bit more comfortable to
use<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:31.890> Jingyu<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.610> newest<00:01:32.909> -<00:01:33.060> bye<00:01:33.210> -<00:01:33.270> bye

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
putting this on the list is the price it

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.030 
putting this on the list is the price it
is<00:02:54.569> about<00:02:54.750> half<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:55.140> price<00:02:55.290> of<00:02:55.560> other<00:02:55.680> cubes

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040
