this video is for those of you who've
been<00:00:02.520> asking<00:00:02.730> me<00:00:03.000> to<00:00:03.030> show<00:00:03.300> both<00:00:03.540> the<00:00:03.720> master

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
been asking me to show both the master

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.650 
been asking me to show both the master
replicas<00:00:04.620> and<00:00:04.859> the<00:00:05.130> EFX<00:00:05.730> versions<00:00:06.240> of<00:00:06.450> the

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
replicas and the EFX versions of the

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.129 
replicas and the EFX versions of the
mark<00:00:06.990> 9<00:00:07.200> science<00:00:07.770> tricorder<00:00:08.370> side-by-side<00:00:09.139> so

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
mark 9 science tricorder side-by-side so

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.620 
mark 9 science tricorder side-by-side so
here<00:00:10.320> they<00:00:10.440> are<00:00:10.590> for<00:00:10.830> you<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:11.040> compare<00:00:11.420> on<00:00:12.420> the

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
here they are for you to compare on the

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.299 
here they are for you to compare on the
right<00:00:12.840> we<00:00:13.019> have<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.500> master<00:00:13.769> replicas

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
right we have the master replicas

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.640 
right we have the master replicas
version<00:00:14.610> of<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.759> tricorder<00:00:15.240> on<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:16.170> left<00:00:16.410> the

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
version of the tricorder on the left the

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.960 
version of the tricorder on the left the
EFX<00:00:17.130> version<00:00:18.650> now<00:00:19.650> there<00:00:20.070> were<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.250> handful<00:00:20.789> of

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
EFX version now there were a handful of

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.120 
EFX version now there were a handful of
small<00:00:21.270> changes<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:21.810> EFX<00:00:22.320> made<00:00:22.590> before<00:00:23.010> they

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
small changes that EFX made before they

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.880 
small changes that EFX made before they
release<00:00:23.430> their<00:00:23.670> tricorder<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.529> them<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:25.710> would

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
release their tricorder of them I would

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.800 
release their tricorder of them I would
say<00:00:25.920> there's<00:00:26.220> two<00:00:26.519> noticeable<00:00:27.210> differences

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
say there's two noticeable differences

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.320 
say there's two noticeable differences
the<00:00:28.710> first<00:00:29.010> being<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.429> color<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.150> main

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
the first being the color of the main

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.910 
the first being the color of the main
body<00:00:30.599> which<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.080> can<00:00:31.199> see<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:31.740> the

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
body which you can see is that the

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.650 
body which you can see is that the
master<00:00:32.250> replicas<00:00:32.730> on<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:32.969> right<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.390> little

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
master replicas on the right is a little

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.620 
master replicas on the right is a little
darker<00:00:34.079> in<00:00:34.110> color<00:00:34.489> the<00:00:35.489> EFX<00:00:36.030> on<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.300> left<00:00:36.510> a

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
darker in color the EFX on the left a

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.370 
darker in color the EFX on the left a
little<00:00:36.750> bit<00:00:36.870> lighter

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
little bit lighter

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.209 
little bit lighter
now<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.070> EFX<00:00:38.670> color<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.180> more<00:00:40.190> accurate<00:00:41.190> to

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
now the EFX color is more accurate to

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.950 
now the EFX color is more accurate to
the<00:00:41.520> screen-used<00:00:41.940> color<00:00:42.329> for<00:00:42.600> this<00:00:42.660> prop

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
the screen-used color for this prop

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.319 
the screen-used color for this prop
what's<00:00:43.829> nice<00:00:44.040> about<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.520> master<00:00:44.850> replicas

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
what's nice about the master replicas

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.670 
what's nice about the master replicas
version<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.899> that<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.170> does<00:00:46.379> match<00:00:46.649> the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
version is that it does match the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.010 
version is that it does match the
boomerang<00:00:47.309> phaser<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:47.850> they<00:00:47.940> released<00:00:48.270> so

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
boomerang phaser that they released so

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.180 
boomerang phaser that they released so
if<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.170> have<00:00:49.289> these<00:00:49.440> on<00:00:49.559> display<00:00:49.680> next<00:00:50.070> to

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
if you have these on display next to

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.979 
if you have these on display next to
each<00:00:50.280> other<00:00:50.399> those<00:00:51.059> two<00:00:51.090> will<00:00:51.449> look<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.750> same

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
each other those two will look the same

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.490 
each other those two will look the same
the<00:00:52.649> EFX<00:00:53.280> version<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.730> little<00:00:53.940> bit<00:00:54.059> lighter<00:00:54.500> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
the EFX version a little bit lighter the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.260 
the EFX version a little bit lighter the
other<00:00:55.649> big<00:00:55.920> difference<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.579> lighting

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
other big difference is the lighting

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.959 
other big difference is the lighting
diffusion<00:00:57.750> for<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.050> main<00:00:58.230> graphics<00:00:58.770> screen

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
diffusion for the main graphics screen

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.430 
diffusion for the main graphics screen
pros<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.149> cons<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.480> both<00:01:00.600> versions<00:01:00.840> though<00:01:01.230> as

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
pros and cons of both versions though as

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.219 
pros and cons of both versions though as
you<00:01:02.190> can<00:01:02.340> see<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.699> EFX<00:01:03.180> on<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.480> left<00:01:03.719> when<00:01:04.110> the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
you can see the EFX on the left when the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.630 
you can see the EFX on the left when the
lights<00:01:04.439> are<00:01:04.559> not<00:01:04.619> running<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.309> do<00:01:05.460> have<00:01:05.610> a

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
lights are not running you do have a

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.270 
lights are not running you do have a
more<00:01:05.850> crisp<00:01:06.210> graphic<00:01:06.840> when<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.920> lights<00:01:08.100> are

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
more crisp graphic when the lights are

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.590 
more crisp graphic when the lights are
running<00:01:08.640> though<00:01:08.760> as<00:01:08.880> you'll<00:01:09.060> see<00:01:09.210> in<00:01:09.299> just<00:01:09.479> a

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
running though as you'll see in just a

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.500 
running though as you'll see in just a
minute<00:01:09.720> here<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.850> master<00:01:11.850> replicas<00:01:12.299> on<00:01:12.420> the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
minute here the master replicas on the

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.730 
minute here the master replicas on the
right<00:01:12.720> you're<00:01:12.930> gonna<00:01:13.020> see<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.320> little<00:01:13.530> more

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
right you're gonna see a little more

00:01:13.740 --> 00:02:19.720 
right you're gonna see a little more
detail

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.830 

the<00:02:20.730> other<00:02:20.880> thing<00:02:21.030> too<00:02:21.240> that<00:02:21.270> I<00:02:21.450> know<00:02:21.510> some<00:02:21.810> of

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
the other thing too that I know some of

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.690 
the other thing too that I know some of
you<00:02:22.020> are<00:02:22.050> upset<00:02:22.230> about<00:02:22.440> is<00:02:22.830> that<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.310> display

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
you are upset about is that the display

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.600 
you are upset about is that the display
placard<00:02:24.300> for<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.570> EFX<00:02:24.990> does<00:02:25.740> not<00:02:25.920> fit<00:02:26.340> on<00:02:26.490> the

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
placard for the EFX does not fit on the

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.040 
placard for the EFX does not fit on the
display<00:02:27.000> base<00:02:27.210> if<00:02:27.450> you<00:02:27.480> wanted<00:02:27.750> to<00:02:27.840> have<00:02:27.960> the

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
display base if you wanted to have the

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.980 
display base if you wanted to have the
acrylic<00:02:28.440> cover<00:02:28.620> on<00:02:28.860> that<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:30.660> master

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
acrylic cover on that the master

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.170 
acrylic cover on that the master
replicas<00:02:31.350> one<00:02:31.500> does<00:02:31.770> but<00:02:32.640> what<00:02:32.760> I'd<00:02:32.880> say<00:02:33.060> is

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
replicas one does but what I'd say is

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.550 
replicas one does but what I'd say is
don't<00:02:33.360> get<00:02:33.450> too<00:02:33.510> upset<00:02:33.660> because<00:02:34.140> as<00:02:34.260> you<00:02:34.380> can

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
don't get too upset because as you can

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.620 
don't get too upset because as you can
see<00:02:34.710> even<00:02:34.890> when<00:02:35.070> it's<00:02:35.220> on<00:02:35.310> there<00:02:35.610> if<00:02:36.510> you

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
see even when it's on there if you

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.810 
see even when it's on there if you
display<00:02:36.930> in<00:02:37.020> the<00:02:37.080> tricorder<00:02:37.470> open<00:02:37.950> its<00:02:38.520> right

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
display in the tricorder open its right

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.970 
display in the tricorder open its right
on<00:02:38.970> top<00:02:39.240> of<00:02:39.270> the<00:02:39.540> display<00:02:39.900> base<00:02:40.110> or<00:02:40.740> on<00:02:40.890> the

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
on top of the display base or on the

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.490 
on top of the display base or on the
play<00:02:41.310> plaque<00:02:41.550> rather<00:02:41.820> so<00:02:42.810> in<00:02:42.930> my<00:02:43.050> opinion<00:02:43.170> that

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
play plaque rather so in my opinion that

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.830 
play plaque rather so in my opinion that
actually<00:02:43.740> looks<00:02:43.920> better<00:02:44.540> displayed<00:02:45.540> in<00:02:45.660> front
