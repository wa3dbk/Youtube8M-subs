00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 Herzlich videos have been around for a while 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.700
 none of kobe that was thought yesterday 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.350
 Captain facebook again only post 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.690
 put out a few questions now and ask 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.219
 I answered her and then it works 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.530
 already starting with the first question 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.089
 Do you make my abo? 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.940
 not at gamescom and do mine 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.410
 series aw complete so too 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.060
 aptly gamescom can be played simultaneously 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.470
 in one say as I think next 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.910
 but meet me on the 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.650
 gamescom its so a people 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.250
 together there you can have something funny 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.990
 do 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.550
 until then I did not really before 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.650
 each making surpass after 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.739
 which also results in the time 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.940
 up to money comes and in competitive we 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.530
 that all not that I want there one 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.610
 make a series because you are gorgeous or 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.440
 and then what's next for a Gaudi have 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.719
 you have a navi and how many ideas have 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.789
 did you play on the ps4 i did with 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.039
 35 hkd I believe that now is the time 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.379
 and I have a dna playing too 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.930
 already live main channels could see how 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.760
 is your cat actually so am 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.280
 At the beginning I have my cat two weeks 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.140
 long or longer have no name 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.690
 something with fluffy the whole someone 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.790
 very fluffy meanwhile means 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:11.330
 the simba has your cat a longboard 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.330
 let's say yes 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.969
 you will actively stream live 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:21.259
 plan is definitely ripped off that 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:23.119
 easy on topics how often do I do it that way 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.600
 unfortunately it is well in the coming 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.369
 sternen 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.350
 after much time remains nevertheless 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.899
 But let's have a look so I have already 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.759
 why run while smelling feet 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:35.149
 place is simply because you have one 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:37.429
 abortion is how about one 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:40.280
 room to chance, I have you 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:41.509
 planned for longer but I have to 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.700
 you still make my room clean up 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.250
 It may take years, what do you play? 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.869
 even more than cd are now comes one 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.780
 long answer, that is, I still have 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.250
 a second channel 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.840
 there are also many other games like the one on 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.640
 Most minecraft that is actually that 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.920
 what we currently enjoy the most 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.659
 minecraft more cd then I still see that 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.369
 to take why are you super 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.890
 smash preview then i still see mario 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.959
 kart then i have fifa yes and then and 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.789
 and so I'm actually playing each one 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:09.440
 play every game exaggerated though 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.610
 extremely many different games 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.349
 Of course, that's nothing to me 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.120
 but expected to be in live streams 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.379
 stain in the future often times different 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.590
 game variants come 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:19.850
 why won the wm in austria 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.230
 I could say a lot now but me 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.519
 think a picture describes the whole 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.639
 better than a thousand words 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.510
 In which city do you live most? 

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:28.190
 should already a bit what I have 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.600
 come from Austria where exactly me yes 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.989
 not a bit the mobile probably 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.950
 not yet 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.410
 So I 'm from grad which small 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.190
 to prove better 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.200
 So you can not do that at all 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.060
 compare the simple answer would be 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.120
 now that we are a team infect 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.160
 clear but the answer so to speak, then 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.260
 right, the impact is simple 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.940
 mine is the first and best was what 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.500
 I've ever given myself but what 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.819
 it is still a pity that it is not anymore 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.769
 exists as it was then 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.530
 and that's why impact is already there 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.090
 Do you need to smoke on the subject I wanted 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.810
 generally own video already 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.919
 make long 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.530
 I can do it now 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:05.299
 say I am like money 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.190
 Occasional smoker does not smoke 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.980
 alone if I smoke then only if 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:16.010
 another smoker is why is 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:16.940
 pure mobbing victim youtube it was 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.280
 begin 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.280
 with my introduction video on the 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.920
 plan channel yes that should be an answer 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.570
 rich or why is your name you give 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.890
 Do not look pick there loads 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.630
 which energy drink do you drink? 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.250
 Most of all, most people have to be disappointed 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.170
 I'm not an active splatter I drink 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.020
 not so much like monster energy 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:42.500
 is still drinking the good old red bull 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:44.240
 you came to the name of guests like 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.310
 you have come to the name 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.450
 I think that's more the question and that 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.740
 while today i just like me 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.180
 have always existed before 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.580
 It welcomed as always agree no 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:58.400
 but then on the 29th 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:04:00.020
 two 2012 a day because I thought 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.460
 I want to create this channel today 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.910
 just have this day as mine 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.150
 channel 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.640
 Birthday, so to speak, and yes that's it 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.440
 no one- year-old special the wee 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.670
 then after four years to do and 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.170
 But I had a bit of time pressure 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.940
 just to take against the mid caps 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.010
 nothing because someday a gap you and 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.750
 then just taken and have here 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.700
 the channel is already on money 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.560
 have now been renamed to gaps 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.150
 and then she is again 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.200
 If I have witnessed , I would 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.610
 Happy if you thumb my thumb up 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.919
 There is an extremely high amount of work 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.800
 including this audio track one that 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.660
 Altogether only 35 different 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.160
 audio then recorded 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.750
 nor has then stow the 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.190
 Do a lot of work that would 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.600
 I would be happy the whole work 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.890
 estimate with a thumbs up 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.480
 maybe write a comment 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.490
 with constructive criticism so that 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.960
 last one gets a lot better and 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.960
 first of all
