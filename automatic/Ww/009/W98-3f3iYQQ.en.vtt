actually thought that the other guitar
player<00:03:10.209> was<00:03:10.359> here<00:03:10.569> or<00:03:11.140> that<00:03:11.349> somebody<00:03:11.530> else<00:03:11.709> is

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
like any of the cars this year ago

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.890 
like any of the cars this year ago
telegram<00:03:15.069> um<00:03:16.170> anyway<00:03:17.170> so<00:03:17.859> there<00:03:18.010> are<00:03:18.370> a<00:03:18.400> few

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
telegram um anyway so there are a few

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.259 
telegram um anyway so there are a few
basic<00:03:19.900> things<00:03:20.530> to<00:03:20.980> keep<00:03:21.129> in<00:03:21.250> mind<00:03:21.310> when<00:03:22.180> you're

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
basic things to keep in mind when you're

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.349 
basic things to keep in mind when you're
trying<00:03:22.480> to<00:03:22.719> emulate<00:03:23.379> the<00:03:23.650> sound<00:03:23.799> of<00:03:23.950> future

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
trying to emulate the sound of future

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.610 
trying to emulate the sound of future
and<00:03:25.359> some<00:03:25.810> of<00:03:25.870> them<00:03:25.959> are<00:03:26.019> sort<00:03:26.200> of<00:03:26.260> sort<00:03:26.590> of

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
and some of them are sort of sort of

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.740 
and some of them are sort of sort of
obvious<00:03:26.769> which<00:03:27.010> is<00:03:27.129> that<00:03:27.269> the<00:03:28.269> notes<00:03:28.480> aren't

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
obvious which is that the notes aren't

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.690 
obvious which is that the notes aren't
played<00:03:29.049> all<00:03:29.319> at<00:03:29.709> once<00:03:29.950> because<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.459> guitar

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
played all at once because the guitar

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.509 
played all at once because the guitar
players<00:03:30.970> drums<00:03:31.389> and<00:03:31.810> it<00:03:32.349> takes<00:03:32.560> each<00:03:32.980> string

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
players drums and it takes each string

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.949 
players drums and it takes each string
one<00:03:33.760> at<00:03:33.849> a<00:03:33.909> time<00:03:35.730> have<00:03:36.730> you<00:03:36.790> just<00:03:36.909> do<00:03:37.060> that<00:03:37.269> yeah

one at a time have you just do that yeah
it's<00:03:38.200> pretty<00:03:38.379> close<00:03:38.620> but<00:03:38.919> if<00:03:39.220> you<00:03:39.310> just<00:03:39.639> give

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
it's pretty close but if you just give

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:41.819 
it's pretty close but if you just give
it<00:03:39.970> each<00:03:40.359> note<00:03:40.629> a<00:03:40.659> little<00:03:41.109> bit<00:03:41.200> of<00:03:41.290> space<00:03:41.530> and
