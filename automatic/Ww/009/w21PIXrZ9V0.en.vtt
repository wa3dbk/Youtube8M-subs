00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
by bobby boss and it's that you make him

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.789 
by bobby boss and it's that you make him
braid<00:01:20.070> or<00:01:20.400> something<00:01:20.700> like<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.360> what<00:01:22.140> my

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
braid or something like that and what my

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.060 
braid or something like that and what my
part<00:01:23.130> what<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.340> did<00:01:23.729> wrong<00:01:23.909> was<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.570> brought<00:01:25.290> the

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
part what I did wrong was I brought the

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.370 
part what I did wrong was I brought the
hair<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.640> already<00:01:26.880> separate<00:01:27.540> into<00:01:27.810> segments

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
hair is already separate into segments

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.350 
hair is already separate into segments
so<00:01:28.920> what<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.100> did<00:01:29.340> was<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.610> separated<00:01:30.210> those

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
so what I did was I separated those

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.929 
so what I did was I separated those
segments<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.020> got<00:01:31.170> very<00:01:31.409> tangled<00:01:32.400> and

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
segments and it got very tangled and

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.890 
segments and it got very tangled and
disarrayed<00:01:33.509> so<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.680> was<00:01:34.860> my<00:01:35.070> fault<00:01:35.430> I

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
disarrayed so I it was my fault I

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.030 
disarrayed so I it was my fault I
thought<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.049> was<00:01:37.259> supposed<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.740> could<00:01:37.920> be

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
thought it was supposed it could be

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.649 
thought it was supposed it could be
taken<00:01:38.400> apart<00:01:38.490> like<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.000> but<00:01:39.390> it's<00:01:39.509> not

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
taken apart like that but it's not

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.600 
taken apart like that but it's not
supposed<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.170> that's<00:01:40.920> why<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.130> have<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.520> be

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
supposed to that's why you have to be

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.280 
supposed to that's why you have to be
very<00:01:41.850> careful<00:01:42.210> when<00:01:42.329> you're<00:01:42.390> buying<00:01:42.450> kinky

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
very careful when you're buying kinky

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.840 
very careful when you're buying kinky
hair<00:01:43.470> like<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.100> have<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.250> make<00:01:44.670> sure

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
hair like this you have to make sure

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.840 
hair like this you have to make sure
that<00:01:45.030> it's<00:01:45.299> not<00:01:46.170> like<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.590> braid<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.670> want<00:01:47.700> to

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
that it's not like a braid you want to

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.560 
that it's not like a braid you want to
make<00:01:47.909> sure<00:01:48.030> it's<00:01:48.360> bulk<00:01:48.750> it's<00:01:49.290> like<00:01:50.180> ease<00:01:51.180> them

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
make sure it's bulk it's like ease them

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.749 
make sure it's bulk it's like ease them
bulk<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.350> but<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.530> think<00:01:52.740> braid<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.310> probably

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
bulk and but I think braid is probably

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.670 
bulk and but I think braid is probably
I'm<00:01:54.270> not<00:01:54.329> for<00:01:54.659> sure<00:01:54.689> about<00:01:54.960> this<00:01:55.229> but<00:01:55.470> the

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
I'm not for sure about this but the

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.399 
I'm not for sure about this but the
braids<00:01:56.549> I<00:01:56.790> think<00:01:57.060> are<00:01:57.689> already<00:01:58.140> kind<00:01:58.290> of

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
braids I think are already kind of

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.980 
braids I think are already kind of
separated<00:01:59.100> or<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.790> little<00:02:00.240> bit<00:02:00.329> harder<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.659> take

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
separated or a little bit harder to take

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.219 
separated or a little bit harder to take
to<00:02:01.350> take<00:02:01.560> apart<00:02:01.890> versus<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.759> being<00:02:02.820> like<00:02:03.299> the

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
to take apart versus it being like the

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.010 
to take apart versus it being like the
bulk<00:02:04.500> where<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.640> can<00:02:05.790> easily<00:02:06.090> separate<00:02:06.750> it

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
bulk where you can easily separate it
