let's<00:01:25.920> start<00:01:26.040> about<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:27.259> think<00:01:28.259> it's<00:01:28.409> PDF

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
let's start about I think it's PDF

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:41.560 
let's start about I think it's PDF
sketch<00:01:30.689> it's<00:01:31.229> very<00:01:31.409> cool

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.870 

so<00:01:42.200> this<00:01:42.530> is<00:01:42.560> a<00:01:42.860> paper<00:01:43.070> so<00:01:43.570> i'm<00:01:44.570> told<00:01:44.930> it's<00:01:45.380> not

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
so this is a paper so i'm told it's not

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.020 
so this is a paper so i'm told it's not
consuming<00:01:46.880> any<00:01:47.260> power<00:01:48.310> when<00:01:49.310> it's<00:01:49.580> not<00:01:49.790> moving

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
consuming any power when it's not moving

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.840 
consuming any power when it's not moving
right<00:01:50.330> once<00:01:50.660> it's<00:01:50.840> on<00:01:50.960> the<00:01:51.080> ePaper<00:01:51.490> yes<00:01:52.490> sure

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
right once it's on the ePaper yes sure

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.399 
right once it's on the ePaper yes sure
and<00:01:53.180> we<00:01:54.170> software<00:01:55.750> development<00:01:56.750> so<00:01:56.990> we<00:01:57.170> can

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
and we software development so we can

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.170 
and we software development so we can
make<00:01:58.070> it<00:01:58.220> I<00:01:58.580> think<00:01:59.320> maximum<00:02:00.340> it<00:02:01.340> should<00:02:01.700> reach

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
make it I think maximum it should reach

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.910 
make it I think maximum it should reach
2<00:02:02.869> 3<00:02:03.410> weeks<00:02:04.369> reading<00:02:04.820> if<00:02:05.600> everything<00:02:06.229> every

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
2 3 weeks reading if everything every

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.340 
2 3 weeks reading if everything every
day<00:02:07.070> two<00:02:07.130> or<00:02:07.460> three<00:02:07.670> hours<00:02:07.780> so<00:02:08.780> this<00:02:08.959> is<00:02:09.080> to<00:02:09.229> be

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
day two or three hours so this is to be

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.530 
day two or three hours so this is to be
to<00:02:09.709> reiterate<00:02:10.130> once<00:02:10.729> again<00:02:11.030> this<00:02:11.180> is<00:02:11.360> not<00:02:11.390> a

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540
