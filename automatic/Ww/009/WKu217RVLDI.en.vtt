00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.500 

you'd<00:01:41.310> have<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.520> say<00:01:41.850> they've<00:01:42.120> really<00:01:42.360> had<00:01:42.480> a

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
you'd have to say they've really had a

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.480 
you'd have to say they've really had a
good<00:01:42.720> game<00:01:42.960> plan<00:01:42.990> for<00:01:43.560> attacking<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.220> three

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
good game plan for attacking the three

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.450 
good game plan for attacking the three
four<00:01:44.730> five<00:01:45.030> hitters<00:01:45.240> all<00:01:45.660> game<00:01:45.900> long<00:01:46.250> yeah<00:01:47.250> and

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
four five hitters all game long yeah and

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.980 
four five hitters all game long yeah and
I<00:01:47.520> think<00:01:47.580> the<00:01:47.880> only<00:01:48.240> thing<00:01:48.480> that's<00:01:48.690> better

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
I think the only thing that's better

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.650 
I think the only thing that's better
than<00:01:49.230> a<00:01:49.260> game<00:01:49.620> plan<00:01:49.980> has<00:01:50.460> been<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.850> execution

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.660 
than a game plan has been the execution

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.200 
than a game plan has been the execution
of<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.710> World<00:01:52.980> Series<00:01:53.280> trophy<00:01:53.760> will
