00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.900

 seasoning of fajitas and salt and for the 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.080
 We are going to make two eggs 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.750
 simply and with a little salt if 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.460
 then I'll show you now we're going to 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.810
 go directly to the kitchen and demonstrate 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.810
 how do we do what is the filling 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.670
 now let's put then here 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:49.470
 we have as always our 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:52.020
 our saucepan or pan with apes 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.380
 we have put oil on her as always 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.290
 I say wet just on the kitchen paper 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.140
 in a few drops of oil and we passed it and 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.980
 we are going to put that the 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.970
 onion 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.970
 and the peppers 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:19.239
 I love 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.840
 this you have to let it be done 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:25.819
 softly 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.819
 before adding the bag 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.079
 while the we left a stirring occasionally 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.330
 when at medium heat and then we're going 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:40.760
 to add the chicken 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.950
 good now that the peppers and the 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.300
 onion are ready we are going to throw 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.300
 the chicken pieces 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.959
 let's pray the first thing quickly and 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.819
 then we'll leave it to fire 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.680
 soft 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:01.719
 Especially to make it juicy 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.719
 the filling 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.850
 the meat is a little bit that has been 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.130
 bleached a little bit then we're going 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.830
 to throw the seasoning 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.940
 and we will leave as I said capped 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.940
 on a gentle fire he cited 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.170
 to know that it is very tasty 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.629
 and it's almost a gala meal 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.110
 well now we leave it 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.230
 remember that you can eat this in 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.819
 days of course pv from the phase 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.150
 of consolidation that you can already take 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.150
 vegetables 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.550
 we're going to leave it like this then and 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.300
 then what we are going to do is prepare 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:07.250
 the tortilla the French omelette with 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:10.520
 just with the two eggs and we're going to 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.410
 I'm going to show you how to build 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.360
 well very well here we have already returned 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.930
 then here as you see we have the 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.489
 filling 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.639
 has been measured with these colors that 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.639
 they have 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.350
 and the tortilla that we have already made 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.350
 then now we are going to version 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.020
 It is very abundant 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.370
 fill in so 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.320
 I think you 're going to be satisfied with 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.880
 this 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.880
 let's put on the plate 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.340
 to 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:52.150
 now we have in the previous one I left you 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:55.749
 a little filling on the outside so that 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:59.790
 you would see how it was but well I 

00:04:55.749 --> 00:05:02.220
 we have a list that has been easy 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.050
 what I was saying is very very abundant 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:08.250
 because well this I think for a 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:10.110
 a meal a dinner we have left over and of all 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.580
 ways the filling the faces the measures 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.930
 that you gave yourself can reach to do 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.370
 two meals the filling is done 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.750
 You can freeze it quietly or 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.670
 save in the fridge action for the day 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.920
 next and you can prepare two 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.480
 fajitas I hope you like tell me 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.550

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.000
