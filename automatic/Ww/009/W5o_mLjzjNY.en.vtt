standards that controllers set for

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.319 
standards that controllers set for

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
and at least on tape the pilots didn't

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.300 
and at least on tape the pilots didn't
seem<00:02:14.989> fazed<00:02:15.260> by<00:02:15.469> this<00:02:15.650> I<00:02:15.950> guess<00:02:16.099> the<00:02:16.189> question

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
seem fazed by this I guess the question

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.750 
seem fazed by this I guess the question
is<00:02:16.640> was<00:02:16.819> anybody<00:02:17.150> put<00:02:17.450> in<00:02:17.629> real<00:02:17.870> danger<00:02:18.079> here

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
is was anybody put in real danger here

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.490 
is was anybody put in real danger here
probably<00:02:19.760> not<00:02:19.969> but<00:02:20.269> you<00:02:20.510> know<00:02:20.599> I<00:02:20.629> have<00:02:20.989> been<00:02:21.260> as

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
probably not but you know I have been as

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.740 
probably not but you know I have been as
a<00:02:21.530> fast<00:02:21.829> as<00:02:22.400> a<00:02:22.519> part<00:02:22.760> of<00:02:22.790> my<00:02:22.909> job<00:02:23.150> I've<00:02:23.420> been<00:02:23.599> in

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
a fast as a part of my job I've been in

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.660 
a fast as a part of my job I've been in
control<00:02:24.019> towers<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:24.769> I<00:02:24.829> am<00:02:24.950> always<00:02:25.219> so

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
control towers and I am always so

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.580 
control towers and I am always so
careful<00:02:25.939> not<00:02:26.209> to<00:02:26.390> say<00:02:26.780> anything<00:02:26.989> or<00:02:27.409> do

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
careful not to say anything or do

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.319 
careful not to say anything or do
anything<00:02:27.620> that<00:02:28.280> would<00:02:28.700> distract<00:02:29.090> a

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.329 
anything that would distract a

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.300 
anything that would distract a
controller<00:02:29.810> I<00:02:30.140> think<00:02:30.650> that<00:02:30.829> is<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.099> concern

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
controller I think that is the concern

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.039 
controller I think that is the concern
where<00:02:31.879> controllers<00:02:32.480> could<00:02:32.780> they<00:02:32.870> have<00:02:32.989> been

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
where controllers could they have been

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:35.710 
where controllers could they have been
anyway<00:02:33.620> been<00:02:33.859> distracted<00:02:34.579> by<00:02:35.000> having<00:02:35.299> a<00:02:35.390> child

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
anyway been distracted by having a child

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.199 
anyway been distracted by having a child
their<00:02:36.109> child<00:02:36.500> in<00:02:37.099> the<00:02:37.250> control<00:02:37.609> tower<00:02:37.640> at<00:02:38.090> the

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
their child in the control tower at the

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.530 
their child in the control tower at the
time<00:02:38.480> and<00:02:38.780> also<00:02:39.049> what<00:02:40.010> if<00:02:40.220> a<00:02:40.459> pilot<00:02:40.760> didn't

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
time and also what if a pilot didn't

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.929 
time and also what if a pilot didn't
hear<00:02:41.959> properly<00:02:42.430> instructions<00:02:43.430> or<00:02:43.639> perhaps

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:43.939 
hear properly instructions or perhaps

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.539 
hear properly instructions or perhaps
another<00:02:44.450> pilot<00:02:44.950> misunderstood<00:02:45.950> instructions

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
another pilot misunderstood instructions

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:48.460 
another pilot misunderstood instructions
because<00:02:46.909> you've<00:02:47.209> got<00:02:47.329> a<00:02:47.389> child's<00:02:47.959> voice<00:02:48.109> in

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
because you've got a child's voice in

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.960 
because you've got a child's voice in
your<00:02:48.500> ear<00:02:48.650> as<00:02:48.950> opposed<00:02:49.250> to<00:02:49.370> an<00:02:49.459> adult<00:02:49.670> voice

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
your ear as opposed to an adult voice

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.849 
your ear as opposed to an adult voice
those<00:02:50.510> are<00:02:50.689> very<00:02:50.900> serious<00:02:51.349> issue<00:02:51.530> yeah<00:02:51.680> are

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:51.859 
those are very serious issue yeah are

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:53.289 
those are very serious issue yeah are
you<00:02:51.980> surprised<00:02:52.400> that<00:02:52.489> no<00:02:52.669> pilots<00:02:53.060> at<00:02:53.150> least

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
you surprised that no pilots at least

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:54.879 
you surprised that no pilots at least
the<00:02:53.419> ones<00:02:53.569> we<00:02:53.750> heard<00:02:53.959> on<00:02:54.079> tape<00:02:54.319> raised<00:02:54.620> any

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:54.889 
the ones we heard on tape raised any

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:56.649 
the ones we heard on tape raised any
objections<00:02:55.579> when<00:02:55.819> they<00:02:55.970> heard<00:02:56.120> this<00:02:56.269> child's

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:56.659 
objections when they heard this child's

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:59.740 
objections when they heard this child's
voice<00:02:56.780> directing<00:02:57.439> them<00:02:57.590> you<00:02:58.400> know<00:02:58.599> we're<00:02:59.599> all

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
voice directing them you know we're all

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.509 
voice directing them you know we're all
fathers<00:03:00.230> and<00:03:00.379> mothers<00:03:00.439> at<00:03:00.889> least<00:03:01.040> a<00:03:01.129> lot<00:03:01.280> of<00:03:01.430> us

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
fathers and mothers at least a lot of us

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.699 
fathers and mothers at least a lot of us
and<00:03:01.879> I<00:03:02.030> think<00:03:02.060> you<00:03:02.689> know<00:03:02.720> you<00:03:02.870> probably<00:03:03.169> your

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
and I think you know you probably your

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.309 
and I think you know you probably your
first<00:03:03.889> instinct<00:03:04.489> is<00:03:04.579> to<00:03:04.639> is<00:03:05.540> to<00:03:05.599> smile<00:03:06.019> that<00:03:06.290> a

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
first instinct is to is to smile that a

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.979 
first instinct is to is to smile that a
child<00:03:06.769> is<00:03:06.950> you<00:03:07.370> know<00:03:07.489> is<00:03:07.700> is<00:03:08.209> there<00:03:08.599> but<00:03:08.840> I

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
child is you know is is there but I

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.530 
child is you know is is there but I
think<00:03:09.560> many<00:03:09.859> people<00:03:10.250> view<00:03:10.430> this<00:03:10.609> very

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
think many people view this very

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.479 
think many people view this very
seriously<00:03:12.049> as<00:03:12.470> far<00:03:12.769> as<00:03:12.859> you<00:03:12.950> know<00:03:13.099> is<00:03:13.220> anything

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
seriously as far as you know is anything

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.699 
seriously as far as you know is anything
like<00:03:13.639> this<00:03:13.819> ever<00:03:14.000> happened<00:03:14.419> before<00:03:14.560> in<00:03:15.560> a

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
like this ever happened before in a

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.199 
like this ever happened before in a
control<00:03:16.069> tower<00:03:16.280> not<00:03:16.549> that<00:03:16.699> I'm<00:03:16.790> aware<00:03:16.909> of<00:03:17.060> but

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
control tower not that I'm aware of but

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.830 
control tower not that I'm aware of but
back<00:03:17.479> in<00:03:17.510> 1994<00:03:18.220> there<00:03:19.220> was<00:03:19.459> an<00:03:19.879> Aeroflot<00:03:20.389> plane

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
back in 1994 there was an Aeroflot plane

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.990 
back in 1994 there was an Aeroflot plane
in<00:03:21.079> Russia<00:03:21.349> that<00:03:21.560> crashed<00:03:22.099> in<00:03:22.310> Siberia

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
in Russia that crashed in Siberia

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.569 
in Russia that crashed in Siberia
because<00:03:23.750> the<00:03:23.900> pilot<00:03:24.290> LED<00:03:24.440> his<00:03:24.590> 12<00:03:24.889> and<00:03:25.069> 16<00:03:25.340> year

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
because the pilot LED his 12 and 16 year

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.180 
because the pilot LED his 12 and 16 year
old<00:03:25.729> kids<00:03:26.260> take<00:03:27.260> the<00:03:27.409> controls<00:03:27.739> of<00:03:27.859> the<00:03:27.949> plane

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
old kids take the controls of the plane

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.580 
old kids take the controls of the plane
and<00:03:28.430> essentially<00:03:28.849> they<00:03:29.000> crash<00:03:29.269> the<00:03:29.449> plane<00:03:29.590> 75

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
and essentially they crash the plane 75
