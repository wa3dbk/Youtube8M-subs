00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
position sensor it's right above the the

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:35.660 
position sensor it's right above the the
oil<00:01:28.310> filter<00:01:29.310> housing<00:01:30.770> I'm<00:01:31.770> using<00:01:34.610> okay<00:01:35.610> so

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
oil filter housing I'm using okay so

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.260 
the take off the oil filter as you see
it<00:01:41.310> says<00:01:41.490> little<00:01:41.759> star<00:01:42.630> bit<00:01:43.369> that<00:01:44.369> GM<00:01:44.789> usually

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
it says little star bit that GM usually

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.389 
it says little star bit that GM usually
has<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.690> lot<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:46.009> and<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:49.009> don't<00:01:50.009> think<00:01:50.220> I'll<00:01:50.369> need

has a lot of and I don't think I'll need

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.690 
has a lot of and I don't think I'll need
quarter-inch<00:01:51.000> but<00:01:51.270> all<00:01:51.539> these<00:01:51.780> are<00:01:51.960> 3/8<00:01:52.670> so<00:01:53.670> I

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
quarter-inch but all these are 3/8 so I

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.389 
quarter-inch but all these are 3/8 so I
got<00:01:53.880> 3/8<00:01:54.270> ratchet<00:01:55.009> extension<00:01:56.360> and<00:01:58.399> wobble

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399

get<00:03:07.209> up<00:03:07.359> like<00:03:07.629> that<00:03:07.870> and<00:03:08.790> you'll<00:03:09.790> have<00:03:09.939> to<00:03:10.120> turn

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
get up like that and you'll have to turn

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.619 
get up like that and you'll have to turn
this<00:03:10.840> until<00:03:11.769> it<00:03:11.980> lines<00:03:12.519> up<00:03:12.730> on<00:03:12.909> that<00:03:13.090> bulb<00:03:13.329> then

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:13.629 
this until it lines up on that bulb then

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:15.959 
this until it lines up on that bulb then
you<00:03:13.750> can<00:03:13.930> undo<00:03:14.859> the<00:03:14.980> bolt<00:03:15.159> the<00:03:15.370> bolt<00:03:15.519> wasn't

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:15.969 
you can undo the bolt the bolt wasn't

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:19.709 
you can undo the bolt the bolt wasn't
all<00:03:16.150> that<00:03:16.209> tight<00:03:17.969> so<00:03:18.969> that<00:03:19.000> was<00:03:19.239> good

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:19.719 
all that tight so that was good

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:23.420 
all that tight so that was good
and<00:03:20.230> then<00:03:20.829> what<00:03:20.980> I<00:03:21.010> did<00:03:21.129> to<00:03:21.489> to<00:03:21.909> get<00:03:22.090> it<00:03:22.209> out<00:03:22.420> I

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
and then what I did to to get it out I

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:31.920 
and then what I did to to get it out I
had<00:03:24.430> a<00:03:25.650> pulled<00:03:26.650> on<00:03:27.780> this<00:03:28.780> wire<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:31.450> main<00:03:31.689> wire

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
had a pulled on this wire the main wire

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.619 
had a pulled on this wire the main wire
and<00:03:32.319> it's<00:03:32.470> on<00:03:32.680> so<00:03:33.609> I<00:03:33.639> pulled<00:03:33.879> from<00:03:34.030> the<00:03:34.209> top<00:03:34.419> up

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:34.629 
and it's on so I pulled from the top up

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:41.399 
and it's on so I pulled from the top up
there<00:03:34.659> and<00:03:35.790> then<00:03:36.790> I<00:03:36.909> got<00:03:37.150> a<00:03:39.480> flat<00:03:40.480> in<00:03:40.689> at<00:03:41.260> the

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:41.409 
there and then I got a flat in at the

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:43.949 
there and then I got a flat in at the
screwdriver<00:03:41.939> and<00:03:42.939> doing<00:03:43.329> both<00:03:43.510> of<00:03:43.750> them<00:03:43.870> at

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
screwdriver and doing both of them at

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.470 
screwdriver and doing both of them at
the<00:03:44.049> same<00:03:44.109> time<00:03:44.560> I<00:03:44.590> was<00:03:44.799> able<00:03:44.950> to<00:03:45.099> walk<00:03:45.400> it<00:03:45.609> kind

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
the same time I was able to walk it kind

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.839 
the same time I was able to walk it kind
of<00:03:46.569> walk<00:03:46.719> it<00:03:46.900> up<00:03:47.250> and<00:03:48.250> you<00:03:48.400> see<00:03:48.579> if<00:03:48.669> it<00:03:48.760> just

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
of walk it up and you see if it just

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:55.289 
of walk it up and you see if it just
pulls<00:03:49.120> off<00:03:49.359> that<00:03:50.219> all<00:03:51.219> right<00:03:51.540> so<00:03:53.940> now<00:03:54.940> what<00:03:55.150> I'm

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
pulls off that all right so now what I'm

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:05.390 
pulls off that all right so now what I'm
going<00:03:55.569> to<00:03:55.629> do<00:03:59.159> is<00:04:01.139> we<00:04:02.139> got<00:04:02.349> to<00:04:02.590> figure<00:04:03.220> out

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
going to do is we got to figure out

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:14.339 
going to do is we got to figure out
where<00:04:06.400> this<00:04:06.959> where<00:04:07.959> that<00:04:08.199> cable<00:04:08.590> goes<00:04:13.349> that

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
where this where that cable goes that

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:17.279 
where this where that cable goes that
might<00:04:14.560> not<00:04:15.370> be<00:04:15.400> fine<00:04:15.819> but<00:04:16.389> at<00:04:16.720> least<00:04:16.840> we<00:04:17.019> got<00:04:17.139> at

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.289 
might not be fine but at least we got at

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:21.330 
might not be fine but at least we got at
least<00:04:17.320> from<00:04:17.769> down<00:04:17.949> here<00:04:18.870> if<00:04:19.870> I<00:04:20.530> have<00:04:20.739> to<00:04:20.889> I'll

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
least from down here if I have to I'll

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.430 
least from down here if I have to I'll
go<00:04:21.909> on<00:04:22.090> top<00:04:22.360> and<00:04:22.919> tie<00:04:23.919> a<00:04:23.949> rope<00:04:24.250> on<00:04:24.490> that<00:04:25.349> to<00:04:26.349> the

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
go on top and tie a rope on that to the

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.290 
go on top and tie a rope on that to the
top<00:04:26.650> of<00:04:26.889> it<00:04:27.070> and<00:04:27.159> then<00:04:27.520> pull<00:04:27.729> it<00:04:27.880> down<00:04:28.020> and<00:04:30.300> pull

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
top of it and then pull it down and pull

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.159 
top of it and then pull it down and pull
it<00:04:31.419> out<00:04:31.539> from<00:04:31.750> the<00:04:31.840> bottom<00:04:32.259> but<00:04:32.949> and<00:04:33.990> then<00:04:34.990> that

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
it out from the bottom but and then that

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.499 
it out from the bottom but and then that
way<00:04:35.320> we<00:04:35.470> can<00:04:35.650> route<00:04:35.830> it<00:04:35.860> the<00:04:36.099> same<00:04:36.310> way<00:04:36.550> so<00:04:36.759> all

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:37.509 
way we can route it the same way so all

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
this hooks up back back here see that

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.270 
this hooks up back back here see that
that's<00:04:51.159> already<00:04:51.460> unplugged<00:04:52.860> but<00:04:53.860> these

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
that's already unplugged but these

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.350 
that's already unplugged but these
connect<00:04:54.789> to<00:04:55.000> each<00:04:55.210> other

connect to each other
and<00:04:56.710> there's<00:04:57.710> a<00:04:57.800> little<00:04:58.039> bracket<00:04:58.759> that<00:04:59.210> goes

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
and there's a little bracket that goes

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:06.909 
and there's a little bracket that goes
on<00:04:59.810> right<00:05:00.909> there<00:05:02.229> and<00:05:04.000> mine<00:05:05.000> was<00:05:05.900> so<00:05:06.169> brittle

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
on right there and mine was so brittle

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:11.879 
on right there and mine was so brittle
okay<00:05:08.199> here's<00:05:09.199> the<00:05:09.319> bracket<00:05:09.740> it<00:05:09.830> goes<00:05:09.979> on<00:05:10.300> and

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889 
okay here's the bracket it goes on and

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:14.649 
okay here's the bracket it goes on and
goes<00:05:12.889> in<00:05:13.129> there<00:05:13.280> like<00:05:13.310> this<00:05:13.699> and<00:05:14.060> you<00:05:14.360> can<00:05:14.479> kind

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:14.659 
goes in there like this and you can kind

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:18.219 
goes in there like this and you can kind
of<00:05:14.720> see<00:05:14.930> that<00:05:15.139> this<00:05:15.349> is<00:05:15.530> just<00:05:15.680> brittle<00:05:17.110> and<00:05:18.110> it

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:18.229 
of see that this is just brittle and it

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:25.240 
of see that this is just brittle and it
broke<00:05:18.470> off<00:05:20.440> but<00:05:21.970> this<00:05:22.970> right<00:05:23.270> here<00:05:24.250> clips

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
broke off but this right here clips

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.300 
broke off but this right here clips
inside<00:05:25.639> of<00:05:25.819> this<00:05:26.000> and<00:05:26.300> you<00:05:27.080> can<00:05:27.620> unclip<00:05:28.190> it

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
inside of this and you can unclip it

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.930 
inside of this and you can unclip it
from<00:05:28.370> there

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
from there

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:34.029 
from there
and<00:05:29.030> bring<00:05:30.020> it<00:05:30.169> out<00:05:30.400> there's<00:05:31.400> a<00:05:31.490> little<00:05:33.039> push

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039 
and bring it out there's a little push

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:40.089 
and bring it out there's a little push
tab<00:05:34.780> you<00:05:35.780> see<00:05:36.020> it<00:05:36.169> right<00:05:37.330> right<00:05:38.330> there<00:05:39.099> anyways

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:40.099 
tab you see it right right there anyways

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:43.059 
tab you see it right right there anyways
there's<00:05:40.639> a<00:05:40.729> push<00:05:40.940> tab<00:05:41.150> on<00:05:41.389> there<00:05:41.599> and<00:05:42.139> you<00:05:42.860> just

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:43.069 
there's a push tab on there and you just

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:46.990 
there's a push tab on there and you just
push<00:05:43.310> that<00:05:43.550> push<00:05:44.270> that<00:05:44.419> tab<00:05:44.690> and<00:05:45.879> you're<00:05:46.879> going

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
push that push that tab and you're going

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.990 
push that push that tab and you're going
to<00:05:47.030> work<00:05:47.180> it<00:05:47.389> out<00:05:47.509> but<00:05:47.780> you<00:05:48.310> know<00:05:49.310> it'll<00:05:49.819> come

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
to work it out but you know it'll come

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.409 
to work it out but you know it'll come
out<00:05:50.030> eventually<00:05:50.210> so<00:05:51.940> now<00:05:52.940> what<00:05:53.120> I'm<00:05:53.210> going<00:05:53.270> to

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
do is I got a whole bunch of weight as

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.029 
do is I got a whole bunch of weight as
you<00:05:59.180> can<00:05:59.270> see<00:05:59.360> I<00:05:59.389> got<00:05:59.629> it<00:05:59.780> taped<00:06:00.319> up<00:06:01.029> and<00:06:02.029> I<00:06:03.039> got
