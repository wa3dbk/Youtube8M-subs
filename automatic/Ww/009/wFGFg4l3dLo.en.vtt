 the weekly health magazine on German Welle TV 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.540
 In our studio conversation you can learn more about health fitness and 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.609
 Wellness and nutrition 

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:17.029
 every week new expert talk and singing takes place 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.590
 how do you actually think that personally 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.820
 optimal weight or is it perhaps something completely different? "We want that 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.130
 now find out here and these questions you go, among other things 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.279
 at the German Institute for Nutrition Research in Potsdam 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.280
 near Berlin after professor 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.450
 hans-georg Joost greet you warmly that you are there you are leading this 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.570
 Institute why not all of us still do not notice people like that 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.810
 hard to get slim or stay who is that? 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.550
 he has the problem to see his very powerful regulation 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.600
 what our body weight controls in particular the themed state 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.800
 the fat store 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.690
 and that reacts at every deflection 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.050
 and then the 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.030
 Percent the premium levy 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.140
 drives underneath 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.040
 or driving up hunger 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.480
 and in overweight, this system is obviously obscured 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.229
 that leads to very special 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.310
 fierce headwind Lars Hohmann and then she returns to the old chapel 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.890
 I mean back the body basically defends the fat stores 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.360
 If you are less Werdenberg vice versa it is not so there is very much 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.150
 let's not slow us down suddenly 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.450
 but it is the same, but we have this regulation is always needed 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.670
 the first humans Romanian he had to come over the winter 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.200
 because they could not create any food storage 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.890
 and now the such a regulatory system survived well down there 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.230
 had been secured 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.340
 So it is endeavored to absorb food and then not in winter 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.020
 starved 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.400
 Well, maybe that's good for the question of what govern us or what 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.290
 Water our attitude 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.860
 With the over weight to do then that's how the overweight in the head starts 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.680
 in the genes 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.320
 yes, this is so far located in the head percent lower brain death 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.000
 to back 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.810
 but you have to say that other brain areas like 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.930
 the centers taste the group 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.750
 Percent control motivation 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.939
 reward 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:12.260
 that participate in the regulation of body weight and even 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.759
 also operate the energy sales 

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:17.660
 despite the hunger in the world the fight is taking 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.340
 the beaver weight too against that just what do the why will that 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.340
 World population the mat Ka what's available 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:30.839
 the system is genetically conditioned but we can not one generation 

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:33.189
 have changed our genes 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:38.109
 the living conditions are relevant and since percent are the two sides of the 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:41.459
 Medal quite clear it's once the diet ride on the other side 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.199
 of course our sitting 

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:44.529
 way of life 

00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:48.650
 Percent likes to motorized everything that used to cost muscle power 

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:51.239
 Bochumer are about to diet which was already in the oldest in it 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:52.149
 the last years 

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:54.639
 the NADA why has that changed 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:59.299
 Percent, we seem to have tasted percent to a servus 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.219
 high calorie diet found 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:04.949
 which outwits this regulation system 

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:05.979
 it is fine 

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:09.499
 The combination of fat and sugar may still be with its steet too 

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:10.969
 delicious 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:13.639
 Percent also finished products

 Percent of their calorie content man 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:19.859
 no longer just measures, but where you have to pay attention not too much 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:20.870
 make a percent 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.900
 to look at it as the body war actually no longer with him 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.999
 what the first 50 Niger nations that designer fod 

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:29.619
 Sneaking up on the Danes Kasper is so 

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:32.969
 Brosius from a health point of view, the creations actually for that

 me optimal 

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:37.849
 Weight so it finds a lot of forms and all sorts of aids but 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:40.079
 what is my optimal weight 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.429
 yes, there are several methods 

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:46.799
 Percent to set an ideal weight all have in common 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.599
 that they should actually reflect the body fat but that 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:54.139
 Problem is this is not on the entire country Kopten on the 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:57.879
 Localization of the fat and healthy as relevant is the fat in the abdomen 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:59.859
 that means the best few mothers 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:03.329
 It's easy to see health-related effects of being overweight 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:04.399
 the belly circumference 

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:05.579
 and that should 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.499
 you are on the safe side 

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:09.459
 Percent as a man under 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.679
 93 4 90 centimeters and for the woman under 80 centimeters that is in the 

00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:17.579
 Basically you can forget the car noticeably if the stomach and that is one 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.680
 was more cosmetic if the belly circumference was right 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.620
 At least I am 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.349
 it's the same on the health-safe side 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:26.749
 It is always something slightly overweight people but themselves 

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:28.530
 moving much healthier than being 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.169
 slim sports muffle 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:32.270
 that's true too 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.880
 Percent e the sport that means the muscle work in addition to the effect 

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:40.280
 hopes the weight still one of these independent teams would depend on Fekter for 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.719

 Percent prevents diabetes in part 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:48.099
 Percent simply makes it better for a high-fat diet 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:51.340
 because we can then oxidize them in the muscle 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.790
 When we starve, the body on top of son Friedrich switches the Wiener 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.940
 Program lowers calorie consumption 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.110
 how can I do this dreaded jojo effect then often afterwards 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.490
 I can get the title 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.180
 Now there is really no other method than 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.410
 Percent to find a lifestyle that can be sustained 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.990
 always then

 if you can not sustain the measure you take 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.500
 and percent Niederhof Light's percent lowered body weight again 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.900
 Return to initial value 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.060
 as must bring bars I have to permanently change my diet 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.439
 now it is said everywhere that is not enough exercise should be urgently

 to reduce my weight to be recommended 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.199
 2000 kilocalories a week that's a lot like that

 about one hour a day is going very fast or a half 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:41.089
 Very fast cycling hour by hour 

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:43.860
 Percent was to add that you not only 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.289
 Recreational sports activities should be considered but

 the whole day 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.240

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:59.349
 Percent to move the muscle so little things like stair climbing and

 lift Pass 

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:04.159
 Percent short distances to walk around not with the car and 

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:06.770
 much more, he is every step of the neighbor 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.630
 Thanks so much to viewer questions from Uganda, we have a lot of viewer questions 

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:12.439
 Although it saves us writing 

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:15.949
 she says in vogue surgery are also currently operating room or gastric reduction 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:17.719
 Narrowing down how risky they are 

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:18.869
 advise them to do so 

00:06:18.869 --> 00:06:22.770
 Ariana's last one learned that this surgery is very effective 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.460
 but we know 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.460
 Not everything we need to know about the long-term risks 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:30.300
 therefore who the recommendation at the moment 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.419
 This brand distribution operation makes sense for people already 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:38.670
 Second of the complications of overweight have diabetes 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:39.900
 mellitus 9 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.759
 that's life-saving cut and that means

 a surgery

 correct the diabetes 

00:06:46.369 --> 00:06:50.159
 and that could be life-prolonging, meaning Dr in the Wind » 

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:53.919
 just as a son brings could be greater than the feared 

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:54.599
 risk 

00:06:54.599 --> 00:06:56.620
 Finner convertibles that they were with us
