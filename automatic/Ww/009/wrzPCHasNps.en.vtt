hey<00:00:00.989> today<00:00:01.530> I'm<00:00:01.829> going<00:00:02.040> to<00:00:02.159> be<00:00:02.250> showing<00:00:02.580> you

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
hey today I'm going to be showing you

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.070 
hey today I'm going to be showing you
how<00:00:03.780> to<00:00:03.810> make<00:00:04.380> wall<00:00:04.890> jumping<00:00:05.750> for<00:00:06.750> your

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
how to make wall jumping for your

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.370 
how to make wall jumping for your
physics<00:00:07.770> platforms<00:00:08.480> so<00:00:09.480> I've<00:00:09.870> already<00:00:10.080> made<00:00:10.320> a

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
physics platforms so I've already made a

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.339 
physics platforms so I've already made a
tutorial<00:00:10.679> on<00:00:11.219> how<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:11.610> make<00:00:12.059> basic<00:00:12.570> physics

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
tutorial on how to make basic physics

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.250 
tutorial on how to make basic physics
platform<00:00:13.920> Allah<00:00:14.099> system<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.900> this<00:00:15.900> is<00:00:16.080> pretty

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
platform Allah system and this is pretty

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.070 
platform Allah system and this is pretty
much<00:00:16.379> just<00:00:16.590> adding<00:00:16.890> on<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.160> that<00:00:17.869> I've<00:00:18.869> set<00:00:19.050> up

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
much just adding on to that I've set up

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.650 
much just adding on to that I've set up
the<00:00:19.260> keys<00:00:19.500> so<00:00:19.980> we've<00:00:20.580> got<00:00:20.730> right<00:00:20.970> left<00:00:21.390> in

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
the keys so we've got right left in

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.910 
the keys so we've got right left in
space<00:00:21.960> just<00:00:22.289> so<00:00:22.410> you<00:00:22.470> can<00:00:22.590> see<00:00:22.650> we're<00:00:22.890> not

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
space just so you can see we're not

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.250 
space just so you can see we're not
pressing<00:00:23.220> them<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.820> basically<00:00:24.660> see<00:00:25.109> how<00:00:25.199> it

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
pressing them and basically see how it

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.179 
pressing them and basically see how it
works<00:00:25.580> so<00:00:26.580> I've<00:00:27.570> already<00:00:27.750> got<00:00:27.960> this<00:00:28.109> made<00:00:28.380> I'm

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
works so I've already got this made I'm

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.299 
works so I've already got this made I'm
just<00:00:29.670> going<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.910> take<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.390> code<00:00:31.250> okay<00:00:32.250> so

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
just going to take to the code okay so

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.920 
just going to take to the code okay so
we've<00:00:32.669> got<00:00:32.790> left<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.149> mark<00:00:33.300> movement<00:00:33.719> and

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
we've got left a mark movement and

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.869 
we've got left a mark movement and
jumping<00:00:34.890> guess<00:00:35.850> an<00:00:36.030> hour<00:00:36.180> go<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.570> wall<00:00:37.879> then

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
jumping guess an hour go to wall then

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.540 
jumping guess an hour go to wall then
yeah<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.420> said<00:00:40.140> yeah<00:00:40.610> that<00:00:41.610> there<00:00:42.600> we<00:00:42.660> go

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
yeah you said yeah that there we go

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.650 
yeah you said yeah that there we go
so<00:00:45.300> as<00:00:45.540> you<00:00:45.629> can<00:00:45.719> see<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.020> works<00:00:46.290> now<00:00:47.070> um<00:00:47.660> I've

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
so as you can see it works now um I've

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.100 
so as you can see it works now um I've
got<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.110> tell<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.320> it's<00:00:49.710> not<00:00:50.100> perfect<00:00:51.110> it

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
got to tell you it's not perfect it

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.460 
got to tell you it's not perfect it
works<00:00:52.410> like<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.489> works<00:00:53.699> pretty<00:00:54.000> well<00:00:54.149> but<00:00:54.600> you

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 
works like it works pretty well but you

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.990 
works like it works pretty well but you
know<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.680> can't<00:00:55.829> have<00:00:56.100> an<00:00:56.220> issue<00:00:56.340> every<00:00:56.879> now

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
know you can't have an issue every now

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.100 
know you can't have an issue every now
and<00:00:57.120> then<00:00:57.210> for<00:00:57.629> example<00:00:58.399> fire<00:00:59.399> go<00:00:59.879> up<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.690> like

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
and then for example fire go up to like

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.319 
and then for example fire go up to like
this<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.650> press<00:01:01.980> space<00:01:02.309> then<00:01:02.850> for<00:01:03.180> some

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
this and press space then for some

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.749 
this and press space then for some
reason<00:01:03.390> your<00:01:03.839> launcher<00:01:04.550> now<00:01:05.550> I<00:01:05.580> haven't

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
reason your launcher now I haven't

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:08.120 
reason your launcher now I haven't
figured<00:01:06.030> out<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.390> problem<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.080> yet<00:01:07.380> but

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
figured out the problem to that yet but

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.680 
figured out the problem to that yet but
I'm<00:01:09.090> sure<00:01:09.150> someone<00:01:09.780> will<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.800> yeah<00:01:11.630> okay<00:01:12.630> so

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
I'm sure someone will so yeah okay so

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.460 
I'm sure someone will so yeah okay so
now<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.560> share<00:01:13.860> do<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:16.160> okay<00:01:17.160> so

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
now to share do it okay so

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.280 
now to share do it okay so
it's<00:01:19.130> phenomenal<00:01:19.540> scientific<00:01:20.540> static<00:01:20.930> parent

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
it's phenomenal scientific static parent

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.720 
it's phenomenal scientific static parent
dynamic<00:01:21.860> parent<00:01:22.280> in<00:01:23.090> the<00:01:23.300> dynamic<00:01:23.840> parent

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:24.730 
dynamic parent in the dynamic parent

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.430 
dynamic parent in the dynamic parent
it's<00:01:25.730> just<00:01:25.940> occlusion<00:01:26.510> with<00:01:26.660> acetic<00:01:27.170> and

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
it's just occlusion with acetic and

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.830 
it's just occlusion with acetic and
collusion<00:01:27.890> with<00:01:28.010> dynamic<00:01:28.640> so<00:01:29.420> those<00:01:29.570> are<00:01:29.750> our

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
collusion with dynamic so those are our

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.050 
collusion with dynamic so those are our
collisions<00:01:31.570> okay<00:01:33.460> the<00:01:34.460> player<00:01:34.820> object

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
collisions okay the player object

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.670 
collisions okay the player object

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
created event step event-driven parented

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.880 
created event step event-driven parented
to<00:01:39.710> the<00:01:40.130> dynamic<00:01:40.760> parent<00:01:41.240> uses<00:01:41.840> physics<00:01:42.320> with

to the dynamic parent uses physics with

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.970 
to the dynamic parent uses physics with
a<00:01:42.920> circle<00:01:43.610> shape<00:01:44.890> okay<00:01:47.140> ground<00:01:48.140> object<00:01:48.680> is

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:48.980 
a circle shape okay ground object is

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.940 
a circle shape okay ground object is
just<00:01:49.310> a<00:01:49.550> box<00:01:49.850> use<00:01:50.450> it's<00:01:50.660> fizzy<00:01:51.020> expand<00:01:51.470> its<00:01:51.680> to

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
just a box use it's fizzy expand its to

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.300 
just a box use it's fizzy expand its to
sonic<00:01:52.369> parent<00:01:52.790> and<00:01:53.320> then<00:01:54.320> be<00:01:54.830> I<00:01:54.860> really<00:01:55.160> need

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
sonic parent and then be I really need

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.980 
sonic parent and then be I really need
to<00:01:55.400> say<00:01:55.550> the<00:01:55.670> keys<00:01:55.940> but<00:01:56.330> i'll<00:01:56.600> show<00:01:56.750> you<00:01:56.810> anyway

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
to say the keys but i'll show you anyway

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.370 
to say the keys but i'll show you anyway
all<00:01:59.990> right<00:02:00.140> image<00:02:00.770> indexical<00:02:01.490> 0<00:02:01.869> and<00:02:02.869> then

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
all right image indexical 0 and then

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.350 
all right image indexical 0 and then
with<00:02:03.740> a<00:02:03.770> staff<00:02:04.130> it's<00:02:04.369> just<00:02:04.610> that<00:02:04.850> and<00:02:05.119> that's

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
with a staff it's just that and that's

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.600 
with a staff it's just that and that's
practically<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:05.900> same<00:02:06.170> for<00:02:06.380> the<00:02:06.500> case

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
practically the same for the case

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.360 
practically the same for the case
and<00:02:09.030> then<00:02:09.300> there's<00:02:09.570> just<00:02:09.840> two<00:02:10.200> image<00:02:10.740> indexes

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
and then there's just two image indexes

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.940 
and then there's just two image indexes
and<00:02:11.640> he

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.309 

so<00:02:14.730> that

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
so that

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.839 
so that
okay<00:02:17.689> so<00:02:18.689> now<00:02:19.019> again<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.739> actual<00:02:20.040> proper

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
okay so now again to the actual proper

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.200 
okay so now again to the actual proper
code

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.540 

yeah<00:02:25.330> so<00:02:25.870> start<00:02:26.620> off<00:02:26.710> in<00:02:26.830> the<00:02:26.920> creative<00:02:27.220> it<00:02:27.430> we

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
yeah so start off in the creative it we

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.810 
yeah so start off in the creative it we
said<00:02:27.730> a<00:02:27.760> few<00:02:27.940> variables<00:02:28.330> so<00:02:29.080> left<00:02:29.560> VK<00:02:30.190> left<00:02:30.460> now

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
said a few variables so left VK left now

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.460 
said a few variables so left VK left now
if<00:02:30.880> we<00:02:31.030> can<00:02:31.210> write<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:31.630> jump<00:02:31.870> we<00:02:32.020> get<00:02:32.200> space

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
if we can write and jump we get space

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.570 
if we can write and jump we get space
that<00:02:33.460> just<00:02:33.670> makes<00:02:33.820> changing<00:02:34.330> controls<00:02:34.750> easier

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
that just makes changing controls easier

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.140 
that just makes changing controls easier

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
equals false okay said the vent is

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.610 
equals false okay said the vent is

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
pretty much where it all happens so I

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.950

jump<00:03:14.160> okay<00:03:15.160> and<00:03:15.690> then<00:03:16.690> this<00:03:16.840> is<00:03:16.900> where<00:03:17.290> we<00:03:17.410> set

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
jump okay and then this is where we set

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.640 
jump okay and then this is where we set

otherwise<00:03:25.750> in<00:03:26.019> a<00:03:26.110> girls<00:03:26.620> trip<00:03:26.799> and<00:03:28.140> this<00:03:29.140> is

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
otherwise in a girls trip and this is

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.220 
otherwise in a girls trip and this is
the<00:03:29.409> water<00:03:29.560> over<00:03:29.709> here<00:03:30.010> so<00:03:30.489> if<00:03:31.390> keyboard<00:03:32.019> check

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
the water over here so if keyboard check

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.039 
the water over here so if keyboard check

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
right and physics test overlap x + 1 Y

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.619 
right and physics test overlap x + 1 Y
so<00:03:38.049> this<00:03:38.079> is<00:03:38.470> checking<00:03:38.829> one<00:03:39.819> pixel<00:03:40.209> to<00:03:40.540> the

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:40.629 
so this is checking one pixel to the

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:43.199 
so this is checking one pixel to the
right<00:03:40.870> of<00:03:41.110> the<00:03:41.190> physics<00:03:42.190> object<00:03:42.670> instead<00:03:43.090> of

right of the physics object instead of
one<00:03:43.360> pixel<00:03:43.690> down<00:03:43.980> because<00:03:44.980> we<00:03:45.129> already<00:03:45.280> know

that's in the air using out in a barrel

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.470 
that's in the air using out in a barrel

of the wall next to you and you're in

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:06.360 
of the wall next to you and you're in
the<00:03:59.079> air<00:03:59.579> and<00:04:02.790> jumping<00:04:03.790> so<00:04:04.209> and<00:04:04.540> you've<00:04:05.370> like

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
the air and jumping so and you've like

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.410 
the air and jumping so and you've like
you're<00:04:06.519> pressing<00:04:06.760> the<00:04:07.209> jump<00:04:07.450> key<00:04:08.250> then

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
you're pressing the jump key then

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.539 
you're pressing the jump key then
physics<00:04:10.420> apply<00:04:10.690> for<00:04:11.409> like<00:04:12.069> physics<00:04:12.430> by

physics apply for like physics by
impulse<00:04:14.010> um<00:04:15.810> XY<00:04:16.810> yeah<00:04:17.739> that's<00:04:17.949> minus<00:04:18.310> jump<00:04:18.850> to

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
impulse um XY yeah that's minus jump to

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:22.770 
impulse um XY yeah that's minus jump to
let<00:04:20.199> /<00:04:20.620> for<00:04:20.979> to<00:04:21.220> like<00:04:21.699> kind<00:04:22.000> of<00:04:22.090> send<00:04:22.360> you<00:04:22.510> out

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
let / for to like kind of send you out

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.189 
let / for to like kind of send you out
from<00:04:23.169> the<00:04:23.289> wall<00:04:23.410> with<00:04:23.860> the<00:04:24.010> jump<00:04:24.250> and<00:04:24.520> then

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 
from the wall with the jump and then

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:30.240 
from the wall with the jump and then
this<00:04:26.199> is<00:04:26.470> to<00:04:26.710> send<00:04:27.070> you<00:04:27.190> up<00:04:28.139> okay<00:04:29.139> so<00:04:29.250> that

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
this is to send you up okay so that

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.730 
this is to send you up okay so that
sends<00:04:30.520> you<00:04:30.639> left<00:04:30.970> a<00:04:31.120> bit<00:04:31.270> and<00:04:31.510> that's<00:04:32.020> a<00:04:32.199> new<00:04:32.349> up

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
sends you left a bit and that's a new up

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.070 
sends you left a bit and that's a new up
so<00:04:33.430> you're<00:04:33.699> not<00:04:33.820> like<00:04:34.030> just<00:04:34.270> jumping<00:04:34.690> directly

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
so you're not like just jumping directly

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.159 
so you're not like just jumping directly
up<00:04:35.470> you<00:04:35.710> jump<00:04:35.949> out<00:04:36.070> for<00:04:36.340> all<00:04:36.720> okay<00:04:37.720> and<00:04:37.960> then

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
up you jump out for all okay and then

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:40.219 
up you jump out for all okay and then
it's<00:04:38.349> basically<00:04:38.740> just<00:04:38.860> saying<00:04:39.460> with<00:04:39.669> the<00:04:39.699> lift

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
it's basically just saying with the lift

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:43.320 
it's basically just saying with the lift
like<00:04:41.229> the<00:04:41.770> other<00:04:41.800> one<00:04:42.190> except<00:04:42.970> you're<00:04:43.180> going

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
like the other one except you're going

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.190 
like the other one except you're going
left<00:04:43.630> so<00:04:44.050> much

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200
