00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 by fact we live in a world which 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.520
 evolving by capitalist 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.330
 principle where the fundamentals should be based 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.550
 competition 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.620
 and yet the modern school on my 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.660
 view this is my subjective opinion she 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.259
 certainly not some skills 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.540
 competitiveness and pay 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.699
 after all education is not u be 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.740
 social lift though her to for that 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.270
 many other things were invented 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.930
 who today in modern school 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.029
 being introduced and what and how to change 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.900
 school education to become true 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.109
 social elevator 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.500
 we agreed that we would exchange 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.309
 comments and be sure to later 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.290
 somehow we will try this document 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.329
 use for public discussion 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.680
 because get it right if we don't 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.809
 let's talk to the ministry 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.329
 injects one method it is normal it 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.520
 it is clear but there is more than this method 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.020
 and actually the consumer of education 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.390
 these are parents here I am 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.370
 As a consumer, I can honestly say that I am 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.960
 I do not think that today's education 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.510
 is a social elevator and this 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.680
 unfair because we tried 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.989
 how is it all there 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.570
 get used to egre accept a cigar for 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.339
 order to say yes education 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.110
 it became fair meaning children even from 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.400
 most remote regions can get 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.560
 it is possible to study in the most prestigious 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.180
 friends at moscow but before the fact on 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.520
 today we understand that the very 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.159
 educational content does not give these 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.259
 children skills in this is not much lei 29 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.250
 October in the public chamber passed 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.680
 round table 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.530
 Russian school as a social 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.340
 elevator moderated the discussion made 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.670

 Tina kandelaki experts discussed issues 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.729
 preparing students for entry into society 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.650
 and opportunities to enhance them 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.299
 socio-economic status 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.060
 roundtable participants noted that 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.560
 the main task of school education 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.170
 is not social security 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.470
 the growth of the child and the creation of conditions for his 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.090
 self-fulfillment needs more 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.810
 time to devote to personal development 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.509
 children 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.340
 instill in them independence in 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.439
