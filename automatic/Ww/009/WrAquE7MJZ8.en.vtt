overhead elongate the body and

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.170 
overhead elongate the body and
eventually<00:00:59.070> gravity<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.550> going<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.789> take<00:01:00.000> its

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
eventually gravity is going to take its

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
to shift the hips forward as we tend to

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.060 
to shift the hips forward as we tend to
relax<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.299> area<00:01:12.689> over<00:01:13.229> here<00:01:13.500> that's<00:01:13.950> a

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
relax this area over here that's a

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.910 
relax this area over here that's a
common<00:01:14.460> mistake<00:01:14.670> leaving<00:01:15.659> almost<00:01:16.229> no<00:01:16.500> support

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
common mistake leaving almost no support

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.950 
common mistake leaving almost no support
to<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.340> lower<00:01:17.549> back<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.420> let's<00:01:18.600> try<00:01:18.780> that

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
to that lower back so let's try that

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:29.570 
to that lower back so let's try that
again<00:01:21.950> as<00:01:22.950> we<00:01:23.130> come<00:01:23.340> up
