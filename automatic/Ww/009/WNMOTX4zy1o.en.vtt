00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
anything past about four or five it's a

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.600 
anything past about four or five it's a
little<00:01:33.240> ridiculous<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:34.070> say<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.130> just<00:01:35.159> wanted<00:01:35.549> to

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
little ridiculous I say I just wanted to

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.969 
little ridiculous I say I just wanted to
put<00:01:35.820> three<00:01:36.659> times<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.439> we<00:01:37.560> would<00:01:37.650> highlight

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
put three times so we would highlight

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.030 
put three times so we would highlight
the<00:01:38.220> three<00:01:38.460> times<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.290> then<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.500> would<00:01:40.680> copy

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
the three times and then you would copy

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.310 
the three times and then you would copy
that<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.820> then<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.899> only<00:01:43.229> replace<00:01:44.840> this<00:01:45.840> here

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
that and then you only replace this here

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.760 
that and then you only replace this here
on<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.740> flash<00:01:47.040> on<00:01:47.340> code<00:01:47.640> only<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.649> then<00:01:49.649> we

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
on the flash on code only and then we

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.260 
on the flash on code only and then we
would<00:01:49.890> paste<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.369> there<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.850> really<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.240> only

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
would paste it there and really the only

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.179 
would paste it there and really the only
change<00:01:51.689> we<00:01:51.840> made<00:01:52.020> was<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.590> third<00:01:52.829> digit

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
change we made was the third digit

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.730 
change we made was the third digit
became<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.520> four<00:01:53.880> but<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.990> puts<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.409> at<00:01:55.500> three

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
became a four but that puts it at three

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.490 
became a four but that puts it at three
times<00:01:56.240> so<00:01:57.240> now<00:01:58.229> with<00:01:58.439> all<00:01:58.619> those<00:01:58.860> done<00:02:00.469> we<00:02:01.469> can

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
times so now with all those done we can

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.590 
times so now with all those done we can
take<00:02:01.829> our<00:02:01.979> Joker<00:02:02.219> maker<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.969> begin<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.329> junk

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
take our Joker maker and begin to junk

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.270 
take our Joker maker and begin to junk
or<00:02:03.750> codes<00:02:04.670> ok<00:02:05.670> if<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.420> wanted<00:02:06.689> up<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.530> square<00:02:08.009> to

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
or codes ok if I wanted up and square to

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.070 
or codes ok if I wanted up and square to
turn<00:02:08.580> infinite<00:02:09.000> health<00:02:09.149> on<00:02:09.450> you'd<00:02:09.690> click<00:02:09.899> up

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
turn infinite health on you'd click up

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.050 
turn infinite health on you'd click up
and<00:02:10.259> square<00:02:10.500> in<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.679> joker<00:02:10.979> maker<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.459> it<00:02:11.879> gives

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
and square in a joker maker and it gives
