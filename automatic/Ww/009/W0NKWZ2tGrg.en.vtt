you're thinking oh it's not a lot of

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.100 
you're thinking oh it's not a lot of
liquid<00:02:20.150> left<00:02:20.330> to<00:02:20.480> go<00:02:20.599> in<00:02:20.720> here<00:02:20.900> but<00:02:21.019> remember

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
liquid left to go in here but remember

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.289 
liquid left to go in here but remember
apples<00:02:21.950> and<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.400> orange<00:02:22.730> have<00:02:22.909> lots<00:02:23.180> of

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
apples and the orange have lots of

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:24.910 
apples and the orange have lots of
liquid<00:02:23.690> so<00:02:24.049> this<00:02:24.170> is<00:02:24.290> going<00:02:24.440> to<00:02:24.500> cook<00:02:24.650> down<00:02:24.860> for

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
liquid so this is going to cook down for

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.339 
liquid so this is going to cook down for
about<00:02:25.190> 10<00:02:25.640> to<00:02:25.760> 15<00:02:26.209> minutes<00:02:26.360> and<00:02:26.720> develop<00:02:27.260> a

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
about 10 to 15 minutes and develop a

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.380 
about 10 to 15 minutes and develop a
nice<00:02:27.620> kind<00:02:27.980> of<00:02:28.099> syrup<00:02:28.549> and<00:02:28.700> then<00:02:29.120> when<00:02:29.269> you're

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
everyone whatever done you would do the

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.309 
everyone whatever done you would do the
heat<00:02:37.519> to<00:02:37.730> yes<00:02:37.940> or<00:02:38.180> reduction<00:02:38.690> is<00:02:38.810> all<00:02:39.019> about

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
heat to yes or reduction is all about

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.559 
heat to yes or reduction is all about
having<00:02:39.590> a<00:02:39.829> solid<00:02:40.400> that's<00:02:40.549> moist<00:02:40.940> and<00:02:41.390> the

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
having a solid that's moist and the

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.089 
having a solid that's moist and the
moisture<00:02:42.019> is<00:02:42.140> whipped<00:02:42.409> out<00:02:42.620> of<00:02:42.769> it<00:02:42.920> and

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
moisture is whipped out of it and

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:44.470 
moisture is whipped out of it and
because<00:02:43.370> of<00:02:43.400> that<00:02:43.549> everything<00:02:44.060> is<00:02:44.299> more

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
because of that everything is more

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.390 
because of that everything is more
concentrated<00:02:44.989> and<00:02:45.650> you<00:02:45.769> need<00:02:46.010> that<00:02:46.220> when

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
concentrated and you need that when

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.589 
concentrated and you need that when
