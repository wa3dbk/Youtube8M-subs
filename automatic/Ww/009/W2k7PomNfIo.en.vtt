enough we do know a lot racehorses with
racing<00:01:07.590> saddles<00:01:08.310> but<00:01:09.000> don't<00:01:09.630> do<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:09.960> many

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
racing saddles but don't do so many

racing saddles but don't do so many
showing<00:01:10.470> samples<00:01:10.950> but<00:01:11.159> it's<00:01:11.729> just<00:01:11.850> trying<00:01:12.119> to

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
showing samples but it's just trying to

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.969 
showing samples but it's just trying to
find<00:01:12.240> something<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.900> actually<00:01:13.380> compare<00:01:13.740> the

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
find something to actually compare the

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.030 
find something to actually compare the
thoroughbred<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.939> way<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.390> laps<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.530> lot<00:01:16.950> of

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
thoroughbred in a way that laps a lot of

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
that I've tried always just moves on his

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.949 
that I've tried always just moves on his
back<00:02:50.530> rather<00:02:51.430> than<00:02:51.550> necessarily<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.600> front

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
back rather than necessarily the front

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.199 
back rather than necessarily the front
and<00:02:53.410> they<00:02:53.680> rock<00:02:53.920> slightly<00:02:54.520> and<00:02:54.820> tippy

a tiny sweeties safe loving boy but he's

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:34.980 
a tiny sweeties safe loving boy but he's
not<00:05:24.400> very<00:05:24.460> tired<00:05:33.030> so<00:05:34.030> this<00:05:34.180> is<00:05:34.330> a<00:05:34.360> gel<00:05:34.630> panel

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
not very tired so this is a gel panel

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.160 
not very tired so this is a gel panel
isn't<00:05:35.110> it<00:05:35.290> that<00:05:35.410> we<00:05:35.500> put<00:05:35.710> on<00:05:35.830> him<00:05:36.040> yeah<00:05:36.220> and<00:05:37.170> we

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.170 
isn't it that we put on him yeah and we

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:43.800 
isn't it that we put on him yeah and we
find<00:05:38.440> that<00:05:38.590> when<00:05:38.860> we're<00:05:39.070> fitting<00:05:42.630> very<00:05:43.630> high

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
find that when we're fitting very high

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:44.430 
find that when we're fitting very high
with<00:05:44.080> us

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
with us

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.220 
with us
it's<00:05:45.310> actually<00:05:45.730> very<00:05:45.760> very<00:05:46.000> difficult<00:05:46.750> to

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:47.230 
it's actually very very difficult to

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.440 
it's actually very very difficult to
actually<00:05:47.410> get<00:05:47.800> fitted<00:05:48.490> in<00:05:48.730> a<00:05:48.760> flop<00:05:49.000> saddle

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450 
actually get fitted in a flop saddle

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.570 
actually get fitted in a flop saddle
just<00:05:50.230> purely<00:05:50.500> because<00:05:50.770> the<00:05:50.980> flock<00:05:51.190> rushes

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
just purely because the flock rushes

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.490 
just purely because the flock rushes
down<00:05:51.790> or<00:05:52.270> you've<00:05:52.480> got<00:05:52.660> to<00:05:52.810> flock<00:05:53.020> it<00:05:53.170> really

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
down or you've got to flock it really

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.410 
down or you've got to flock it really
hard<00:05:53.770> to<00:05:54.220> actually<00:05:54.400> get<00:05:54.700> you<00:05:54.850> to<00:05:54.910> stand<00:05:55.150> up<00:05:55.270> off

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:55.420 
hard to actually get you to stand up off

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.080 
hard to actually get you to stand up off
that<00:05:55.450> wither<00:05:55.870> or<00:05:56.320> Tory<00:05:57.280> was<00:05:57.490> saying<00:05:57.730> you<00:05:57.940> know

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090 
that wither or Tory was saying you know

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.270 
that wither or Tory was saying you know
the<00:05:58.690> saddle<00:05:58.990> ends<00:05:59.170> up<00:05:59.260> too<00:05:59.470> wide<00:05:59.710> and<00:06:00.040> coming

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 
the saddle ends up too wide and coming

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.250 
the saddle ends up too wide and coming
down<00:06:00.400> on<00:06:00.580> the<00:06:00.640> withers<00:06:01.000> or<00:06:01.360> they<00:06:01.960> make<00:06:02.170> the

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:02.260 
down on the withers or they make the

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.980 
down on the withers or they make the
tree<00:06:02.470> too<00:06:02.650> narrow<00:06:02.890> and<00:06:03.160> pinches<00:06:03.580> horses<00:06:04.120> so<00:06:04.780> a

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
tree too narrow and pinches horses so a

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.350 
tree too narrow and pinches horses so a
gel<00:06:05.290> panel<00:06:05.710> or<00:06:06.430> in<00:06:06.520> fact<00:06:06.700> one<00:06:06.790> of<00:06:06.820> our<00:06:06.940> reactor

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
gel panel or in fact one of our reactor

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.780 
gel panel or in fact one of our reactor
panel<00:06:07.630> saddles<00:06:08.200> is<00:06:08.740> actually<00:06:09.280> a<00:06:09.430> really<00:06:09.610> good

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:09.790 
panel saddles is actually a really good

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:15.590 
panel saddles is actually a really good
option<00:06:10.240> because<00:06:10.570> there's<00:06:11.230> no<00:06:11.380> collapse<00:06:12.000> low

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.760 

and<00:06:16.620> it's<00:06:17.620> in<00:06:17.830> a<00:06:17.860> round<00:06:18.160> horse<00:06:19.230> fitted<00:06:20.230> we're

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
and it's in a round horse fitted we're

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:26.439 
and it's in a round horse fitted we're
doing<00:06:21.190> that<00:06:21.940> with<00:06:22.210> the<00:06:22.330> pocket<00:06:22.660> is<00:06:22.870> and

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:26.449 

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:29.450 

or<00:06:27.449> something<00:06:27.840> really<00:06:28.050> nice<00:06:28.800> and<00:06:28.860> easily<00:06:29.160> in

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
or something really nice and easily in

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.270 
or something really nice and easily in
them<00:06:29.669> and<00:06:30.080> then<00:06:31.080> of<00:06:31.199> course<00:06:31.229> it<00:06:31.560> retains<00:06:31.949> its

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 
them and then of course it retains its

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:40.339 
them and then of course it retains its
shape<00:06:32.880> and<00:06:33.150> doesn't<00:06:33.330> collapse<00:06:33.660> so<00:06:39.139> we<00:06:40.139> don't

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:40.349 
shape and doesn't collapse so we don't

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:41.930 
shape and doesn't collapse so we don't
touch<00:06:40.470> you<00:06:40.680> use<00:06:40.889> a<00:06:40.919> flop<00:06:41.190> saddle<00:06:41.520> we<00:06:41.610> always

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:41.940 
touch you use a flop saddle we always

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.730 
touch you use a flop saddle we always
use<00:06:42.150> either<00:06:42.449> a<00:06:42.599> gel<00:06:42.810> panel<00:06:43.169> or<00:06:43.259> a<00:06:43.349> reactor

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740 
use either a gel panel or a reactor

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.279 
use either a gel panel or a reactor
panel<00:06:44.039> left<00:06:44.910> term<00:06:45.150> and<00:06:45.599> not<00:06:45.780> there's<00:06:46.020> so<00:06:46.139> much

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:46.289 
panel left term and not there's so much

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:48.110 
panel left term and not there's so much
a<00:06:46.349> react<00:06:46.650> panel<00:06:46.949> for<00:06:47.069> showing<00:06:47.370> or<00:06:47.729> simply<00:06:48.000> high

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:48.120 
a react panel for showing or simply high

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:55.550 
a react panel for showing or simply high
level<00:06:48.419> shown<00:06:52.550> fine
