00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 is to follow teaspoons 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.360
 individualized or customized this 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.219
 we use it when our patient 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.559
 For example, he does not have any of the 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.599
 pizzerias of our kit truth either 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.980
 because he has a bad mental position 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.920
 that your teeth are in the 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.350
 position in which I do not allow me 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.539
 take my record very well not my 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.630
 impression or in patients who in 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:32.390
 occasions they have some kind of 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:34.520
 congenital abnormality true type 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.829
 cleft palate lip to be 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.829
 little ones or who suffer some traumatism 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:42.320
 and you have and society some 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.540
 distortion of shape or something that also 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.820
 does not allow us to place any of the 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.920
 teaspoons that are already elaborated 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:55.059
 true either metal or plastic 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.250
 and they are also used when we 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:00.699
 we want to take a record that has 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.469
 greater accuracy in the case of patients 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:04.930
 that they do not have true teeth inside 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:07.360
 when we are in a next total yes 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:11.020
 that I want the mucosa to be marked 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.450
 with the material closest thing to what 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.610
 have my patient then I make a 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.039
 teaspoon that is a little fairer 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.280
 true so that the material does not flow 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:23.860
 so much, if not so much marquez 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.319
 In this way, the entire mucosa is better 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.569
 and then for patients who do not have 

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:30.310
 teeth and patients who have teeth 

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:31.810
 but that for some reason can not 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.170
 use a spoon that I use 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.170
 I have 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.950
 when we file if there is not so much 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.350
 problem because there are not many areas of 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.510
 retention at the time that I take my 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.120
 printing and I made my teaspoon 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.950
 but when you have teeth like 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.950
 outfits want me to take care 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.290
 I need to first relieve with wax these 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.680
 retention zones ie I with 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:00.740
 visor I will cover my teeth because 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.350
 because as I will create a mass for 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.820
 place on over the teeth and 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.430
 make a spoon and to camp 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.410
 way to fight and there yes yes no longer 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.290
 place some wax reliefs as the 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.860
 teeth are going to fit true and that's not 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.730
 is going to serve me because I'm not going 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.730
 to achieve objectives 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.970
 have enough space for 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.650
 the material will flow if I'm going to understand 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.710
 then the first thing that we have to 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.710
 do 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.190
 is the intention of the wax part of 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.570
 explain the procedure step by step 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.080
 there are two ways to do these 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.860
 teaspoons 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.080
 the first is 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.740
 after I place my being no longer 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.090
 I have a pension 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:50.640
 I go 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:54.150
 it is said acrylic drip technique 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.489
 this is that I'm placing 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.210
 if you apply your vote have a 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:02.650
 small hole the way 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.810
 suspensory 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.390
 good so that it does not leave so toxic 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.400
 Actually I'm going to put on acrylic little 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.220
 a little bit the powder and since there is 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.650
 on my spoon I take same number 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.120
 I really have a dropper for 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.310
 in this case I do not know warm but why 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.170
 do not show that technique and I'm going 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.930
 placing the monomer on top of 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.330
 acrylic and it is impregnated on the 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.330
 surface 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.330
 but
