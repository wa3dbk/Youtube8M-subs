00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
know you got aluminum cone is rigid I

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.460 
know you got aluminum cone is rigid I
strong<00:04:54.970> you<00:04:55.510> got<00:04:55.690> a<00:04:55.720> nice<00:04:55.900> rubber<00:04:56.199> surround

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
strong you got a nice rubber surround

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:57.689 
strong you got a nice rubber surround
its<00:04:57.039> gluten

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:57.699

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
glue the place of course but that's a

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.340 
glue the place of course but that's a
massive<00:05:01.270> massive<00:05:02.260> speaker<00:05:03.840> and<00:05:04.840> the<00:05:05.110> reason

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
massive massive speaker and the reason

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:06.779 
massive massive speaker and the reason
we<00:05:05.410> want<00:05:05.560> something<00:05:05.680> this<00:05:05.830> massive<00:05:06.070> is

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:06.789 
we want something this massive is

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:09.570 
we want something this massive is
doesn't<00:05:07.600> manage<00:05:07.930> structure<00:05:08.350> in<00:05:08.500> here<00:05:08.680> has<00:05:09.340> the

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
doesn't manage structure in here has the

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.230 
doesn't manage structure in here has the
powerful<00:05:10.180> enough<00:05:10.539> to<00:05:11.169> make<00:05:11.380> this<00:05:11.530> pickup<00:05:11.949> move

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
powerful enough to make this pickup move

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.200 
powerful enough to make this pickup move
against<00:05:13.240> the<00:05:13.389> pressure<00:05:13.900> every<00:05:14.260> subwoofers

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
against the pressure every subwoofers

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.610 
against the pressure every subwoofers
right<00:05:16.210> you<00:05:16.630> guess<00:05:16.780> the<00:05:16.900> pressure<00:05:17.110> closing<00:05:17.560> the

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
right you guess the pressure closing the

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.839 
right you guess the pressure closing the
door<00:05:17.889> or<00:05:18.250> any<00:05:19.000> pressure<00:05:19.360> up<00:05:19.510> there<00:05:19.720> that<00:05:20.080> acts

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:20.849 
door or any pressure up there that acts

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:23.370 
door or any pressure up there that acts
against<00:05:21.849> the<00:05:21.970> speaker<00:05:22.210> self<00:05:22.599> so<00:05:23.169> you<00:05:23.229> get

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
against the speaker self so you get

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.110 
against the speaker self so you get
these<00:05:23.500> magnets<00:05:23.979> are<00:05:24.099> small<00:05:24.430> yet<00:05:24.610> these<00:05:24.729> man<00:05:24.940> is

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
these magnets are small yet these man is

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.909 
these magnets are small yet these man is
the<00:05:25.210> retarded<00:05:25.750> you<00:05:26.110> can<00:05:26.260> get<00:05:26.380> the<00:05:26.500> rest<00:05:26.740> has

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
the retarded you can get the rest has

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:30.270 
the retarded you can get the rest has
manner<00:05:27.130> so<00:05:27.520> rice<00:05:27.820> has<00:05:28.090> voiced<00:05:28.449> call<00:05:29.280> diameter

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
manner so rice has voiced call diameter

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.670 
manner so rice has voiced call diameter
in<00:05:30.460> there<00:05:30.669> then<00:05:31.599> we<00:05:31.690> go<00:05:31.840> film<00:05:32.050> it<00:05:32.169> I<00:05:32.380> mean<00:05:32.560> you

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
in there then we go film it I mean you

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.529 
in there then we go film it I mean you
can<00:05:32.710> read<00:05:32.949> the<00:05:33.070> specs<00:05:33.400> online<00:05:33.880> you<00:05:34.330> know<00:05:34.449> what

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:34.539 
can read the specs online you know what

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:35.960 
can read the specs online you know what
