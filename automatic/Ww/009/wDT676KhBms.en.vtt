box down here on the floor this is an LP

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.960 
box down here on the floor this is an LP
gas<00:00:17.660> detector<00:00:18.320> it's<00:00:19.280> got<00:00:19.430> a<00:00:19.460> green<00:00:19.730> light<00:00:19.760> on

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
gas detector it's got a green light on

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.300 
gas detector it's got a green light on
that's<00:00:20.510> normal<00:00:20.990> it<00:00:21.350> might<00:00:21.590> have<00:00:21.800> a<00:00:21.830> little<00:00:22.040> fan

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
that's normal it might have a little fan

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.030 
that's normal it might have a little fan
to<00:00:22.640> it<00:00:22.790> that's<00:00:23.000> normal<00:00:24.430> if<00:00:25.430> that<00:00:25.760> goes<00:00:26.000> off

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:27.040 
to it that's normal if that goes off

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.010 
to it that's normal if that goes off
don't<00:00:28.040> panic<00:00:28.730> but<00:00:28.970> get<00:00:29.210> everybody<00:00:29.630> out<00:00:29.840> of<00:00:29.960> the

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
coach shut the gas off and try and

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.459 
coach shut the gas off and try and
figure<00:00:33.170> out<00:00:33.469> if<00:00:33.950> you<00:00:34.070> truly<00:00:34.309> have<00:00:34.460> a<00:00:34.579> gas<00:00:34.850> leak

00:00:35.459 --> 00:00:35.469 
figure out if you truly have a gas leak

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:39.279 
figure out if you truly have a gas leak
since<00:00:36.469> LP<00:00:36.859> has<00:00:37.070> no<00:00:37.370> real<00:00:38.300> smell<00:00:38.660> to<00:00:38.719> it

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:39.289 
since LP has no real smell to it

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:44.739 
since LP has no real smell to it
that's<00:00:40.129> really<00:00:40.429> a<00:00:42.309> fluorocarbon<00:00:43.749> detector

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:44.749 
that's really a fluorocarbon detector

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:47.619 
that's really a fluorocarbon detector
okay<00:00:45.230> we<00:00:45.679> call<00:00:45.890> it<00:00:46.039> an<00:00:46.129> LP<00:00:46.399> detector<00:00:46.940> because

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
okay we call it an LP detector because

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.229 
okay we call it an LP detector because
LP<00:00:48.140> is<00:00:48.319> a<00:00:48.350> fluorocarbon<00:00:48.730> but<00:00:49.730> if<00:00:49.819> your<00:00:49.969> wife's

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
LP is a fluorocarbon but if your wife's

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.569 
LP is a fluorocarbon but if your wife's
standing<00:00:50.719> here<00:00:50.960> doing<00:00:51.559> her<00:00:51.620> hair<00:00:51.829> and<00:00:52.039> she

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
standing here doing her hair and she

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:53.950 
standing here doing her hair and she
sprays<00:00:52.850> hair<00:00:53.089> spring<00:00:53.390> that<00:00:53.569> falls<00:00:53.839> down

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
sprays hair spring that falls down

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.290 
sprays hair spring that falls down
that'll<00:00:54.350> set<00:00:54.620> it<00:00:54.739> off<00:00:54.890> if<00:00:55.460> you<00:00:55.670> got<00:00:55.819> a<00:00:55.850> candle

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
that'll set it off if you got a candle

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.540 
that'll set it off if you got a candle
here<00:00:56.510> on<00:00:56.629> the<00:00:56.870> on<00:00:57.079> the<00:00:57.800> stand<00:00:58.100> because<00:00:58.370> you

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
you don't have to come into a dark coach

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.830 
you don't have to come into a dark coach

and fumble around trying to find the
light<00:02:26.020> you<00:02:26.170> hit<00:02:26.380> that<00:02:26.560> switch<00:02:26.770> as<00:02:26.950> soon<00:02:27.130> as<00:02:27.190> you

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
light you hit that switch as soon as you

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.200 
light you hit that switch as soon as you
get<00:02:27.370> in<00:02:27.810> so<00:02:28.810> many<00:02:28.900> time<00:02:29.520> like<00:02:30.520> in<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.760> bathroom

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
get in so many time like in the bathroom

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.520 
get in so many time like in the bathroom
if<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.420> fan<00:02:31.660> doesn't<00:02:31.960> work

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
if the fan doesn't work

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.320 
if the fan doesn't work
see<00:02:33.160> if<00:02:33.250> there's<00:02:33.430> a<00:02:33.490> wall<00:02:33.730> switch<00:02:34.060> if<00:02:34.240> the

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
see if there's a wall switch if the

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.480 
see if there's a wall switch if the
light<00:02:34.540> doesn't<00:02:34.810> work<00:02:34.960> somewhere<00:02:35.440> look<00:02:36.250> for<00:02:36.460> a

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
light doesn't work somewhere look for a

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.430 
light doesn't work somewhere look for a
wall<00:02:36.700> switch<00:02:37.030> this<00:02:37.450> is<00:02:37.510> a<00:02:37.630> pretty<00:02:37.900> small<00:02:38.140> coach

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
wall switch this is a pretty small coach

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.590 
wall switch this is a pretty small coach
so<00:02:38.680> it<00:02:38.770> won't<00:02:38.920> take<00:02:39.010> that<00:02:39.160> long<00:02:39.340> to<00:02:39.600> figure

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
so it won't take that long to figure

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.640 
so it won't take that long to figure
everything<00:02:40.720> out<00:02:41.200> if<00:02:41.980> a<00:02:42.280> an<00:02:43.260> outlet<00:02:44.260> doesn't

everything out if a an outlet doesn't

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.250 
everything out if a an outlet doesn't
work<00:02:45.660> again<00:02:47.040> outlets<00:02:48.040> are<00:02:48.160> 110<00:02:48.550> so<00:02:49.000> the<00:02:49.630> you

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
work again outlets are 110 so the you
