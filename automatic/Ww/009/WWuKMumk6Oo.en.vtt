 da unesco for architecture history 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:01:00.399

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:07.130

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.720
 cleaning keeping the old 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.660
 where we are going because we are in the entrance 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.600
 old guatemala at the time of the 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.970
 colony this pile was truly used by 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.970
 all of our housewives here came 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.880
 to wash clothes by giving strangers 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:35.590
 of use the clear electric washing machine and 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.590
 here they wash everything in all people 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.610
 a communal battery precisely so that 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.440
 all women not swimming will wash 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.890

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.890

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.129
 Start 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:33.490
 is painting has called me a detail 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.830
 of the capuchins of guatemala that is 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.220
 recognized worldwide I was 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.840
 thinking that the old age was so 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.400
 Old and will remain so well that 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.770
 only I know what it can be that during 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:55.390
 guatemala has been unique and that is going to 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:57.250

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:05.790
 most emblematic of how you can 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.790
 communicate the marimba with all of us 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:16.430
 here all the wood here is the box 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:16.430
 resonance because the emptiness with the blow 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.590

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:33.160

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:49.080
 collection center for cooperatives 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:52.620
 organizations and groups of people here 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:04:04.530

00:03:52.620 --> 00:04:06.930

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.519
 necessarily be Guatemalan 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:14.340
 but how well they explain to us is that they have 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:16.579
 been part of the hands of the 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.579
 artisans 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:29.690
 many cities sell modernity 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.510

 walls you see in the sounds in how 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.010
 the marimba sounds on how the streets 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.850
 cobbled and see how the sky of certain 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:46.490
 way does not have wires and this kind of 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:48.680
 particularities crafts people 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.050
 the foreigners that what they want to know 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.419
 is that magic of Latin America and since 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.900
 here from antigua guatemala this is 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.900
