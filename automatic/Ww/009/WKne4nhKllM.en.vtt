00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
because they started up war z that they

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.410 
because they started up war z that they
need<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.540> up<00:01:52.470> their<00:01:52.740> game<00:01:52.790> yeah<00:01:53.790> since<00:01:54.210> i<00:01:54.270> could

now they can learn a lot from that why

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.590 
now they can learn a lot from that why
do<00:02:05.729> they<00:02:05.939> need<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.180> go<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.509> same<00:02:06.869> route

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
do they need to go to same route

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.160 
do they need to go to same route

kind of realistic root square it's going

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.289 
kind of realistic root square it's going
to<00:03:22.750> be<00:03:22.930> you<00:03:23.859> know<00:03:23.980> you<00:03:24.040> have<00:03:24.310> to<00:03:24.430> walk<00:03:24.700> for<00:03:25.000> six

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
to be you know you have to walk for six

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:26.699 
to be you know you have to walk for six
hours<00:03:25.540> and<00:03:25.870> it's<00:03:25.959> gonna<00:03:26.079> be<00:03:26.200> difficult<00:03:26.380> to

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
hours and it's gonna be difficult to

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.620 
hours and it's gonna be difficult to
find<00:03:26.739> your<00:03:27.070> friends<00:03:27.549> and<00:03:27.670> it's<00:03:27.790> going<00:03:27.910> to<00:03:28.000> be

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
find your friends and it's going to be

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.690 
find your friends and it's going to be
super<00:03:29.290> annoyed<00:03:29.680> when<00:03:29.890> you<00:03:29.980> die<00:03:30.190> right<00:03:30.489> i<00:03:30.519> think

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
super annoyed when you die right i think

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.250 
super annoyed when you die right i think
was<00:03:31.060> he<00:03:31.269> might<00:03:31.450> be<00:03:31.630> a<00:03:31.660> little<00:03:31.780> bit<00:03:32.079> more

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
was he might be a little bit more

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.069 
was he might be a little bit more
friendly<00:03:32.680> to<00:03:32.920> just<00:03:33.459> people<00:03:34.450> don't<00:03:34.660> know<00:03:34.810> into

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
friendly to just people don't know into

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.289 
friendly to just people don't know into
that<00:03:35.230> would<00:03:35.380> be<00:03:35.440> hardcore<00:03:35.890> game<00:03:36.160> so<00:03:37.030> i<00:03:37.060> think

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
that would be hardcore game so i think

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.630 
that would be hardcore game so i think
it<00:03:37.420> like<00:03:38.109> people<00:03:38.680> compared<00:03:39.010> to<00:03:39.040> two<00:03:39.340> but<00:03:39.579> i

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
it like people compared to two but i

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.599 
it like people compared to two but i
don't<00:03:39.910> think<00:03:39.970> it's<00:03:40.239> a<00:03:40.359> good<00:03:40.390> thing<00:03:40.720> like

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
collecting gathering supplies and all

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.360 
collecting gathering supplies and all
that<00:04:10.660> and<00:04:10.959> I<00:04:11.230> think<00:04:11.440> with<00:04:11.560> war<00:04:11.769> z<00:04:11.980> that<00:04:12.190> it's

that and I think with war z that it's

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.300 
that and I think with war z that it's
going<00:04:12.549> to<00:04:12.609> be<00:04:12.959> more<00:04:13.959> of<00:04:14.019> you<00:04:14.739> get<00:04:14.920> your<00:04:15.069> friends

another issue i find is vehicles and the

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:24.790 
another issue i find is vehicles and the
amount<00:06:23.719> of<00:06:23.780> distances<00:06:24.259> you<00:06:24.349> have<00:06:24.469> to<00:06:24.560> travel
