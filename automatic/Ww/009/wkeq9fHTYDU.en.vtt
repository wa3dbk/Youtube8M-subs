once that's finished this box should

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.309 
once that's finished this box should
close<00:02:45.519> itself<00:02:45.819> this<00:02:46.659> box<00:02:46.989> should<00:02:47.139> close

the desktop little icon underneath will

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:57.080 
the desktop little icon underneath will
disappear<00:02:53.700> all<00:02:54.700> right<00:02:54.849> there<00:02:55.060> goes<00:02:55.090> antivirus

that'll tell windows are shut down and

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.910 
that'll tell windows are shut down and
then<00:03:10.480> leave<00:03:10.629> the<00:03:10.750> charges<00:03:11.049> battery<00:03:11.409> and<00:03:11.620> you

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
then leave the charges battery and you

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.559 
then leave the charges battery and you
can<00:03:11.980> be<00:03:12.159> one<00:03:12.250> of<00:03:12.370> these<00:03:12.430> laminated<00:03:13.030> battery

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
can be one of these laminated battery

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.839 
can be one of these laminated battery

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
students know that this one's already

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.080 
students know that this one's already
been<00:03:17.769> imaged<00:03:18.069> already<00:03:18.370> it's<00:03:18.519> just<00:03:18.730> charging

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
been imaged already it's just charging

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.159 
been imaged already it's just charging
its<00:03:19.180> battery<00:03:20.549> and<00:03:21.780> I'd<00:03:22.780> like<00:03:22.930> to<00:03:23.019> wait<00:03:23.139> till

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:23.169 
its battery and I'd like to wait till

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:24.869 
its battery and I'd like to wait till
it's<00:03:23.440> completely<00:03:23.560> shut<00:03:24.129> down<00:03:24.160> before<00:03:24.519> I<00:03:24.639> clap

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 
it's completely shut down before I clap

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:26.490 
it's completely shut down before I clap
the<00:03:25.030> lid<00:03:25.180> shut<00:03:25.209> because<00:03:25.629> sometimes<00:03:26.230> if<00:03:26.440> you

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
the lid shut because sometimes if you

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.800 
the lid shut because sometimes if you
clap<00:03:26.709> it<00:03:26.829> up<00:03:26.949> too<00:03:27.129> early<00:03:27.160> it<00:03:28.060> kind<00:03:28.239> of<00:03:28.299> freezes

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
clap it up too early it kind of freezes

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.589 
clap it up too early it kind of freezes
right<00:03:28.989> here<00:03:29.349> and<00:03:29.579> the<00:03:30.579> processor<00:03:31.090> spins<00:03:31.389> up

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
right here and the processor spins up

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.990 
right here and the processor spins up
and<00:03:31.810> starts<00:03:32.139> to<00:03:32.230> overheat<00:03:32.440> the<00:03:32.799> bag<00:03:32.980> and<00:03:33.340> bad

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
and starts to overheat the bag and bad

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.099 
and starts to overheat the bag and bad
things<00:03:34.329> gonna<00:03:34.540> happen

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
things gonna happen

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:45.659 
things gonna happen
so<00:03:35.379> I<00:03:35.790> have<00:03:36.790> let<00:03:37.000> that<00:03:37.150> do<00:03:37.449> its<00:03:37.480> thing<00:03:42.750> and<00:03:44.669> when

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:45.669 
so I have let that do its thing and when

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:49.830 
so I have let that do its thing and when
they<00:03:45.790> lamp<00:03:46.829> on<00:03:47.829> the<00:03:48.209> blue<00:03:49.209> little<00:03:49.690> blue

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
they lamp on the blue little blue

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.149 
they lamp on the blue little blue
charging<00:03:50.290> battery<00:03:50.530> charging<00:03:50.859> light<00:03:50.980> when

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:51.159 
charging battery charging light when

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:55.729 
charging battery charging light when
that<00:03:51.310> goes<00:03:51.489> out<00:03:52.260> then<00:03:53.260> you're<00:03:53.409> done<00:03:53.560> charging

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
that goes out then you're done charging

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.839 
that goes out then you're done charging
some<00:03:56.739> of<00:03:56.829> our<00:03:56.919> other<00:03:56.980> models<00:03:57.370> have<00:03:57.430> a<00:03:57.579> little

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
some of our other models have a little

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.339 
some of our other models have a little
green<00:03:58.120> battery<00:03:58.629> lamp<00:03:58.810> but<00:03:58.959> it's<00:03:59.109> the<00:03:59.169> same

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
green battery lamp but it's the same

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.699 
green battery lamp but it's the same
idea

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
idea

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.560 
idea
and<00:04:00.840> that's<00:04:01.840> PC<00:04:02.230> imaging
