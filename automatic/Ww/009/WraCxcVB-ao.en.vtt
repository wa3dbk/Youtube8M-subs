people inboxed me on my previous
tutorial<00:00:04.380> asking<00:00:04.920> how<00:00:05.069> did<00:00:05.250> I<00:00:05.279> do<00:00:05.460> the

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
tutorial asking how did I do the

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.360 
tutorial asking how did I do the
Lightning<00:00:06.540> effect<00:00:06.799> now<00:00:07.799> there<00:00:07.950> are<00:00:08.040> many<00:00:08.160> ways

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
Lightning effect now there are many ways

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.070 
Lightning effect now there are many ways
to<00:00:08.580> do<00:00:08.700> this<00:00:08.820> commonly<00:00:09.210> on<00:00:09.330> YouTube<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:09.929> Vimeo

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
to do this commonly on YouTube and Vimeo

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.620 
to do this commonly on YouTube and Vimeo
I<00:00:10.260> see<00:00:10.469> people<00:00:10.769> turn<00:00:10.980> into<00:00:11.190> After<00:00:11.490> Effects<00:00:11.790> to

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
I see people turn into After Effects to

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.310 
I see people turn into After Effects to
replicate<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.559> lightning<00:00:13.920> and<00:00:15.049> this<00:00:16.049> is<00:00:16.170> not

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
replicate the lightning and this is not

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.689 
replicate the lightning and this is not
the<00:00:16.440> best<00:00:16.590> way<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:16.770> go<00:00:17.010> because<00:00:17.400> you're<00:00:17.580> not

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
the best way to go because you're not

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.429 
the best way to go because you're not
going<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:17.940> be<00:00:18.029> able<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.270> get<00:00:18.449> real<00:00:18.810> shadows<00:00:19.230> and

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
going to be able to get real shadows and

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.640 
going to be able to get real shadows and
real<00:00:19.650> highlights<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.840> pushing<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.020> image<00:00:22.320> to

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
real highlights and pushing the image to

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.830 
real highlights and pushing the image to
overexpose<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.820> other<00:00:23.939> exposures<00:00:24.300> if<00:00:24.660> there

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
overexpose and other exposures if there

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.480 
overexpose and other exposures if there
was<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:24.990> lightning<00:00:25.320> scenario<00:00:25.890> is<00:00:26.039> always<00:00:26.310> going

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
was a lightning scenario is always going

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.670 
was a lightning scenario is always going
to<00:00:26.550> bring<00:00:27.390> up<00:00:27.510> problems<00:00:27.660> with<00:00:28.140> your<00:00:28.260> footage

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
to bring up problems with your footage

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.770 
to bring up problems with your footage
so<00:00:30.650> this<00:00:31.650> is<00:00:31.800> my<00:00:32.160> way<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.730> creating<00:00:33.660> a

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
so this is my way of creating a

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.840 
so this is my way of creating a
lightning<00:00:34.110> effect<00:00:34.410> know<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:35.430> can<00:00:35.579> buy

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
lightning effect know you can buy

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.209 
lightning effect know you can buy
lightning

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
maybe thousands of dollars for the pro

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.299 
maybe thousands of dollars for the pro
staff<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:42.480> was<00:00:42.719> done<00:00:42.930> with<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.739> lighting<00:00:44.070> kit

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
staff this was done with a lighting kit

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.790 
staff this was done with a lighting kit
that<00:00:44.489> cost<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:45.030> hundred<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.110> ten<00:00:46.260> dollars<00:00:46.469> we

that cost a hundred and ten dollars we

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.360 
that cost a hundred and ten dollars we
have<00:00:47.989> tu-160<00:00:48.989> LEDs<00:00:49.410> which<00:00:49.920> were<00:00:50.039> picked<00:00:50.250> up

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
have tu-160 LEDs which were picked up

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.779 
have tu-160 LEDs which were picked up
from<00:00:50.489> ebay<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.120> an<00:00:51.989> LED<00:00:52.230> torch<00:00:52.710> which<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.640> can

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
from ebay and an LED torch which you can

supermarket so what we have here on our

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.590 
supermarket so what we have here on our
lighting<00:00:58.379> diagram<00:00:58.949> we<00:00:59.489> have<00:00:59.760> one<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.180> LEDs

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
lighting diagram we have one of the LEDs

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.900 
lighting diagram we have one of the LEDs
set<00:01:00.930> up<00:01:01.079> already<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.649> this<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.370> just<00:01:02.550> given<00:01:02.789> us

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
set up already and this is just given us

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.880 
set up already and this is just given us
our<00:01:03.120> initial<00:01:03.420> light<00:01:03.840> there's<00:01:04.470> some<00:01:04.680> weak

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
our initial light there's some weak

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.190 
our initial light there's some weak
diffusion<00:01:05.549> on<00:01:05.670> there<00:01:06.420> because<00:01:06.630> we<00:01:06.780> don't<00:01:06.960> want

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
diffusion on there because we don't want

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.289 
diffusion on there because we don't want
this<00:01:07.409> light<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:08.070> be<00:01:08.159> as<00:01:08.250> harsh<00:01:08.580> as<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.060> actual

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
this light to be as harsh as the actual

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.399 
this light to be as harsh as the actual
lightning<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:11.210> this<00:01:12.210> just<00:01:12.450> gives<00:01:12.659> us<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:13.020> nice

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
lightning and this just gives us a nice

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.420 
lightning and this just gives us a nice
nice<00:01:13.830> time<00:01:14.130> feel<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:15.270> then<00:01:15.450> what<00:01:15.659> we<00:01:15.780> have<00:01:16.430> to

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
nice time feel so then what we have to

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.590 
nice time feel so then what we have to
get<00:01:17.670> an<00:01:18.000> initial<00:01:18.659> blast<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.560> lightning<00:01:20.220> now<00:01:20.759> if

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
get an initial blast of lightning now if

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.969 
get an initial blast of lightning now if
I<00:01:21.780> move<00:01:21.930> on<00:01:22.080> if<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.259> if<00:01:22.470> you're<00:01:22.560> ever<00:01:22.710> trying<00:01:22.860> to

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
I move on if I if you're ever trying to

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.010 
I move on if I if you're ever trying to
replicate<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:23.520> effect<00:01:23.820> it's<00:01:24.030> best<00:01:24.720> just<00:01:24.840> to

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
replicate in effect it's best just to

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.690 
replicate in effect it's best just to
watch<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.380> reference<00:01:25.740> footage<00:01:26.070> oh<00:01:26.310> go<00:01:26.580> out

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
watch the reference footage oh go out

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.100 
watch the reference footage oh go out
watch<00:01:26.909> some<00:01:27.150> real<00:01:27.330> footage<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.689> light<00:01:27.930> you

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
watch some real footage of light you

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.260 
watch some real footage of light you
know<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.320> we<00:01:28.560> offer<00:01:28.680> sheet<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.130> rain<00:01:29.400> because

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
know and we offer sheet of rain because

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.210 
know and we offer sheet of rain because
a<00:01:30.869> lot<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.350> time<00:01:31.560> when<00:01:31.890> you're<00:01:31.979> trying<00:01:32.130> to

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
a lot of the time when you're trying to

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.429 
a lot of the time when you're trying to
create<00:01:32.400> stuff<00:01:32.729> digitally<00:01:33.270> if<00:01:34.140> you're<00:01:34.350> not

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
create stuff digitally if you're not

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.670 
create stuff digitally if you're not
using<00:01:34.820> reference<00:01:35.820> with<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.060> real<00:01:36.360> world<00:01:36.680> ends

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
using reference with the real world ends

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.030 
using reference with the real world ends
up<00:01:37.770> looking<00:01:37.890> digital<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:39.380> we<00:01:40.380> have<00:01:40.500> an<00:01:40.650> initial

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
up looking digital so we have an initial

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.020 
up looking digital so we have an initial
blast<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.759> always<00:01:42.259> the<00:01:43.259> first<00:01:43.850> bolt<00:01:44.850> of

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
blast this is always the first bolt of

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.490 
blast this is always the first bolt of
lightning<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.600> comes<00:01:46.170> through<00:01:46.409> your

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
lightning that comes through your

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.219 
lightning that comes through your
windows<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.070> lights<00:01:47.250> up<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.460> whole<00:01:47.640> place

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
windows it lights up the whole place

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.590 
windows it lights up the whole place
this<00:01:49.229> is<00:01:49.350> what<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:49.649> then<00:01:49.860> this<00:01:50.329> LED<00:01:51.329> is

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
this is what this then this LED is

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.440 
this is what this then this LED is
raised<00:01:51.990> off<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.290> ground<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.090> it's<00:01:54.090> pointing

it's only a quick blast about two three

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.889 
it's only a quick blast about two three
frames<00:02:01.909> after<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.030> initial<00:02:03.420> bolt<00:02:03.689> of

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
frames after the initial bolt of

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.289 
frames after the initial bolt of
lightning<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.380> country<00:02:04.890> who<00:02:04.979> window<00:02:05.340> there's

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
lightning the country who window there's

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.749 
lightning the country who window there's
always<00:02:06.540> aftermath<00:02:07.380> lightning<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.190> this

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
always aftermath lightning and this

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.180 
always aftermath lightning and this
isn't<00:02:09.060> as<00:02:09.149> powerful<00:02:09.390> isn't<00:02:09.929> as<00:02:10.410> colossal<00:02:11.039> as

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
isn't as powerful isn't as colossal as

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.890 
isn't as powerful isn't as colossal as
as<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.760> first<00:02:12.000> lightning

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
as the first lightning

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.990 
as the first lightning
so<00:02:13.019> this<00:02:13.470> is<00:02:13.650> what<00:02:13.829> we<00:02:13.920> have<00:02:14.129> our<00:02:14.280> LED<00:02:14.730> torch

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
so this is what we have our LED torch

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.250 
so this is what we have our LED torch
and<00:02:15.120> it's<00:02:15.269> quickly<00:02:15.599> flicked<00:02:15.870> on<00:02:15.989> and<00:02:16.140> off<00:02:16.230> a

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
and it's quickly flicked on and off a

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.530 
and it's quickly flicked on and off a
couple<00:02:16.560> of<00:02:16.680> times<00:02:16.950> now<00:02:17.760> if<00:02:17.879> we<00:02:17.970> play<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.299> scene
