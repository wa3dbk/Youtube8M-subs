00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.010 
funeral that right there is an epic
seven-minute<00:02:28.820> track<00:02:29.150> I<00:02:29.420> thought<00:02:29.720> a<00:02:29.750> lot<00:02:29.960> of

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
seven-minute track I thought a lot of

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.510 
seven-minute track I thought a lot of
that<00:02:30.230> was<00:02:30.350> just<00:02:30.590> gonna<00:02:30.650> be<00:02:30.860> instrumental<00:02:31.400> when

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
that was just gonna be instrumental when

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.980 
that was just gonna be instrumental when
I<00:02:31.550> saw<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:31.820> running<00:02:32.180> time<00:02:32.390> on<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.630> track<00:02:32.810> but

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
I saw the running time on the track but

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.660 
I saw the running time on the track but
that's<00:02:33.140> not<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.410> case<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:34.040> majority<00:02:34.190> of<00:02:34.550> the

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
that's not the case the majority of the

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.730 
that's not the case the majority of the
track<00:02:34.940> so<00:02:34.970> he's<00:02:35.480> showing<00:02:35.510> off<00:02:36.020> the<00:02:36.170> vocals<00:02:36.590> and

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
track so he's showing off the vocals and

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.370 
track so he's showing off the vocals and
just<00:02:37.220> a<00:02:37.430> lot<00:02:37.940> of<00:02:38.090> vulnerability<00:02:38.900> here<00:02:39.110> on<00:02:39.230> that

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
just a lot of vulnerability here on that

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.980 
just a lot of vulnerability here on that
track<00:02:39.680> and<00:02:39.890> I<00:02:39.950> love<00:02:40.190> how<00:02:40.430> much<00:02:40.670> emotion<00:02:41.300> he<00:02:41.810> can

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
track and I love how much emotion he can

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.260 
track and I love how much emotion he can
bring<00:02:42.260> to<00:02:42.440> these<00:02:42.620> songs<00:02:42.890> it's<00:02:43.340> really<00:02:43.730> just<00:02:43.940> I

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
bring to these songs it's really just I

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.640 
bring to these songs it's really just I
don't<00:02:44.480> know<00:02:44.690> it's<00:02:44.870> something<00:02:45.110> that<00:02:45.260> you<00:02:45.380> don't

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
don't know it's something that you don't

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.370 
don't know it's something that you don't

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
we could die like this where he's

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.760 
we could die like this where he's
showing<00:02:50.300> off<00:02:50.450> like<00:02:50.840> more<00:02:51.080> of<00:02:51.110> the<00:02:51.320> harsher
