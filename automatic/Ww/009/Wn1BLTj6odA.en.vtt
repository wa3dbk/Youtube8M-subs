00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.760 
office and I really can tell a
difference<00:02:02.549> as<00:02:03.119> far<00:02:03.149> as<00:02:05.390> hunger<00:02:06.390> if<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.469> have

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
difference as far as hunger if I have

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.130 
difference as far as hunger if I have
this<00:02:07.950> or<00:02:08.129> if<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.280> don't<00:02:08.459> have<00:02:08.610> this

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
this or if I don't have this

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.230 
this or if I don't have this
so<00:02:09.440> I<00:02:09.710> really<00:02:09.979> do<00:02:10.130> okay<00:02:10.580> I<00:02:10.700> mean<00:02:10.880> I<00:02:10.970> think<00:02:11.000> it's

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
so I really do okay I mean I think it's

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.510 
so I really do okay I mean I think it's
just<00:02:11.569> this<00:02:11.870> type<00:02:12.230> of<00:02:12.260> tea<00:02:12.590> I<00:02:12.860> don't<00:02:13.280> think<00:02:13.430> it

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
just this type of tea I don't think it

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.220 
just this type of tea I don't think it
matters<00:02:13.640> that<00:02:14.060> it's<00:02:14.450> that<00:02:14.810> I'm<00:02:14.930> drinking<00:02:15.170> the

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
matters that it's that I'm drinking the

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.630 
matters that it's that I'm drinking the
chocolate<00:02:15.620> I<00:02:15.709> think<00:02:15.920> if<00:02:16.010> you<00:02:16.100> got<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.400> chai<00:02:16.610> or

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
chocolate I think if you got the chai or

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.949 
chocolate I think if you got the chai or
if<00:02:16.970> you<00:02:17.060> got<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.300> plane<00:02:17.630> Herbeau<00:02:18.590> whatever<00:02:19.959> it

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
if you got the plane Herbeau whatever it

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.780 
if you got the plane Herbeau whatever it
would<00:02:21.110> help<00:02:21.319> with<00:02:21.560> that<00:02:21.709> but<00:02:22.130> I<00:02:22.190> just<00:02:22.310> like<00:02:22.640> the

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
would help with that but I just like the

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.309 
would help with that but I just like the
taste<00:02:23.000> of<00:02:23.180> this<00:02:23.330> and<00:02:23.569> of<00:02:23.630> course<00:02:23.840> if<00:02:24.020> you're<00:02:24.140> on

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
a link in the description so you can

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
can't find these in the store but I have

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.670 
can't find these in the store but I have
found<00:02:59.000> them<00:02:59.330> a<00:02:59.510> lot<00:02:59.780> less<00:03:00.590> expensive<00:03:01.540> online

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
found them a lot less expensive online

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.350 
found them a lot less expensive online
so<00:03:03.680> if<00:03:03.709> you<00:03:04.130> want<00:03:04.310> like<00:03:04.489> again<00:03:04.820> run<00:03:05.150> right<00:03:05.330> out

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
so if you want like again run right out

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.690 
so if you want like again run right out

me<00:04:36.840> what<00:04:37.140> I<00:04:37.170> was<00:04:37.380> because<00:04:38.280> they<00:04:38.430> usually<00:04:38.610> only

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130
