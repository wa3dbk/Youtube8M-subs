00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.580
 please tell me how many times would we 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.740
 they didn't speak to you 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.690
 I ask you this question constantly I think 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.599
 more than once we ask it from what 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:19.060
 there is a price of the tickets for this movie 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:20.080
 the most likely hot question which 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.230
 interests everyone 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.449
 and no matter how many times I answer this 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.369
 the question will still be me all the time 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:31.150
 encore and ask to repeat 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:33.640
 again and because it cares 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.370
 passengers this is obvious so the price is 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.530
 very so thin product actually 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.660
 we do it with saber 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.520
 how does the car take it all ? 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.309
 she doesn't know whether he will be sold or 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.680
 no, it is about one third the price and 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.360
 hangs you on the screen is not the 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.340
 there will be a small price about a third from 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.500
 the maximum value and further and 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.700
 looking at loading sons that you don't 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.039
 buy it starts a little bit 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.750
 shift bind these u valve what are you 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:00.940
 buy it starts to raise you 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.399
 chose for themselves the premium segment so 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.719
 we pulled out of the park ineffective 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.210
 airplanes that did not fit 

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:09.880
 our strategy we get new cars 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.999
 high quality in the family is admissible 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.529
 airbus a320 cheapest car 60 

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:17.319
 million dollars that is you want 

00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:18.969
 say that the ticket price is in many ways 

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:21.429
 depends on which car you face 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:22.270
 which plane you fly is one of 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:24.490
 components 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.659
 it's a long time there 16 percent can 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.999
 be leasing payments 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.299
 we have to pay but your plane is new 

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:34.240
 the second factor is kerosene kerosene is 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.929
 have erotic photos in the price of a ticket 33 percent on 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.270
 present day 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:40.299
 take off his petropavlovsk-kamchatsky 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.450
 vat 18 percent you fly to new york 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:45.099
 vat and no i mean 18 percent you should 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.659
 add the cost of the same distance 

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:47.939
 you understand that no one ever 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.719
 put up with the idea that 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.619
 Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky fly more expensive 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:52.509
 than new york 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.389
 I explain it not because the work depends 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.959
 depends on but on the field we could not 

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:58.810
 Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky at that time 

00:01:55.959 --> 00:02:00.399
 fly an airplane airbus 330 now 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.579
 corrected the situation why we can not 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:06.669
 fly because the airbus 330 plane when 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:09.220
 the same passenger capacity is spending in two 

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:13.000
 less kerosene than our 96 sludge 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.469
 more profitably agree to take 96 why 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.230
 the matter of doing a strip would lengthen up 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:19.050
 the cars of the village are beautiful which is smaller 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.030
 with nato which more rides the price is more expensive 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.150
 here is the answer to a simple question 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.830
 further airport fees a and 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.220
 navigation service 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.260
 with this and all this we take it without 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.180
 what do we promote product advertising 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.610
 salary staff pay whale 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.690
 administrative costs 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.790
 just stable 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.209
 must give the price of the ticket is about 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.470
 72 percent you want to say that 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.810
 seventy-two percent of the cost 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.269
 ticket is the cost of the airline 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.829
 Aeroflot for the transportation of a passenger company 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.599
 about a percentage will he somehow 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:54.530
 changing but it's about all the same and 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:56.970
 the same further we have to pay for 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.739
 product promotion we spend on 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.209
 advertising 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:03.299
 065 percent that is less than one 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.680
 percent of our income though advice 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.200
 directors on allowed up to one 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.209
 percent use western company 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.370
 spends up to three percent on promotion 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.920
 product we have to tell everyone 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.739
 that he is the youngest park we have one of 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.930
 the best measure of food that is beautiful 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.000
 form chance the best service that us 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.340
 good gadget service on board and 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.139
 video library and so on we have it all 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.889
 sell to sell we must 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.510
 to advertise 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:29.040
 tell me how you can 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.260
 comment on the counting statement 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.730
 chambers that the price of Aeroflot 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.769
 I have the price of tickets Aeroflot 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.720
 due to inefficient spending 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.760
 which are inside the company but they 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.349
 call the first thing we are a company 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.530
 state participation is written 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:45.000
 percentage and management in itself why 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.400
 there I will mention the board of directors they 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.500
 management makes the decisions that 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.669
 need state 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.549
 example we need our own car 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:55.829
 domestic before you need it dry 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:59.160
 the superjet airport is the only one 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:01.139
 car to be today to mind and we 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.120
 incur costs you participate in the Olympiad 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:04.980
 us damn period we are time and who if not 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.109
 era fleet will be the national carrier 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.329
 by the way this is 100 million dollars 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:10.459
 living money but see here I called these 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:13.500
 amounts they 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:15.269
 penny in relation to income which 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.549
 doing today arafat aeroflot tan 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:20.760
 makes revenue over six billion 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.590
 dollars well, let's take the amount there 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.090
 100 150 million dollars of these 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.849
 cost is not effective is less than one 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.630
 percent this is for the cost of the ticket not 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:29.630
 will affect
