00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 hi girls and guys welcome to a 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.160
 special video to raise today 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.509
 let's talk of lace and let's see 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.690
 what are the proposals that I want you 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.690
 do 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.710
 and we are going to start with this first 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.900
 proposal and that you choose clothes that 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.640
 have the lace material in the area 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.230
 of the shoulders as you see this I carry 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.000
 and it goes to all the shoulders 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.130
 lace and I think the truth is that 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.810
 It gives a very seductive touch to it 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.730
 time that elegant in this case you see 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.220
 that mixed this lace top with a 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:41.410
 leather miniskirt and one more bag 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.410
 feminine to give a touch more lady 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.370
 we go with the second of the looks in the 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.199
 that I have opted for simplicity and 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.640
 simplicity giving all the importance to 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.320
 the way this dress has 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.660
 you see a dress that marks well 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.239
 Curves has that hourglass shape 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.949
 and then on the neckline as you see it carries the 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.050
 lace that I think is precious that remains 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.240
 super subtle and very delicate in the part 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.369
 back I also want to comment on this 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.140
 another V-shaped neckline that has to 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.619
 I think it makes the dress something very 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.619
 special 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.770
 I 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.240
 we go with the third one not a little more 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.950
 informal that I suggest you 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.900
 use the lace simply to 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.030
 let it glimpse is to say as in the 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.619
 case I'm wearing and a sweater and in the part 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.390
 below simply hinted at a 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.369
 little bit of the lace this you can 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.170
 use doing an overlay of 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.909
 garments whether for example of jersey and 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.470
 under a lace shirt or the other way around 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.780
 example a skirt in almost under carry 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.940
 some darker leggings is simply 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.259
 letting glimpse the lace but it is not 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.259
 following it in its entirety 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.610
 and that we have arrived with these 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.140
 small ideas on how you can include 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.460
 the lace your looks I hope you 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.539
 have liked and see you in the next 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.539
 video until next time
