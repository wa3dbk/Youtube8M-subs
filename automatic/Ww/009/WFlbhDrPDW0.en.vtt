00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.670
 Hello everyone for today's test motto 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.230
 something new 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.750
 probably everyone if you have 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.020
 been tempted to find but that maybe 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.960
 you haven't tried the sausage there 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.079
 Cota faces as very precisely 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.649
 advertised and therefore today the proof for 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:27.720
 you even if in all sincerity perhaps 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:29.820
 maybe I wouldn't have bought it because 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.430
 however from the package 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.730
 it would almost look like a rooster rather than one 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.339
 sausage, however, let's trust it 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.829
 let's see the final result a little bit 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:43.530
 the ad says it's ready for the two 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.469
 minutes and even the package says it 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.870
 even if we have three types of cooking and a 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.149
 depending on the three types of cooking either 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.789
 obviously a different time than 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.859
 in fact microwave preparation is 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.920
 ready in two minutes then it can be 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:00.870
 also boiled with all the 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.199
 pack but I did this procedure 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.260
 and should be cooked for five minutes while in 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.660
 frying pan for eight paddy rice I have 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.170
 two sausages I'm going to do two kinds of 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.050
 cooking 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.620
 sincerely that boiled hawk there 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:19.620
 companies and therefore I will not use this 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:22.530
 technique but I'll make one in the microwave and 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:25.080
 another in the pan then I will make one 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.670
 break of two minutes and a living dalto 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.010
 to read the ingredients a little 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.020
 however, I do n't know what is important 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.970
 if I've told you before but it's from the area 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.590
 so this would suggest that 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.450
 both chicken 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.990
 let's see if this is so then i 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.520
 ingredients we have turkey meat 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.270
 the pork fat so there is also one 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.570
 component 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.509
 pork water with bovine people 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.679
 Pope's field passes the plants 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:56.869
 aromatic lactose fructose and whimsy 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:59.880
 antioxidant spice sodium ascorbate 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:02.329
 preservative sodium nitrite have 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:08.369
 smoking news at each 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:11.310
 stabilizer which are the 450 l 451 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.739
 These so I say nothing 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.610
 if you are prepared I know that many of 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.950
 you are 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.660
 write me what they are like this 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.150
 that others will also know 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.190
 now all I have to do is go and see 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.530
 I will show you the result of course 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.000
 they finish cooking because they actually do 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.170
 but I put everything in the pan and 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.079
 the referee waves after having cooked them for 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.970
 very little time of course 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:39.299
 here are the two versions that promise 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.250
 on the left is the one made in the pan 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.620
 with the right with the micron 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.510
 actually the general color is 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.310
 fairly uniform for both 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.769
 very much the only thing of course 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.090
 the one cooked in the pan will have some 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.090
 more scorches 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.680
 I'm going to cut both in 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.410
 see who they favor obviously is a 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.000
 see if they taste the same or 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.250
 it changes depending on the cooking 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.280
 first of all from the cut 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:12.690
 I'll show you inside obviously 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:16.620
 it has a more wurstel type consistency 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:19.140
 that type sausage so the appearance 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.520
 absolutely nothing the idea of 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.750
 I am going to cut sausage too 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:28.050
 in the other one also this one cooked in the 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.090
 microwaves at a sex effect and is 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.380
 the time has come to taste 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.380
 taste of a birthmark and a pan 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.590
 do try also to microwave 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:51.930
 they have the exact same taste 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.070
 let's talk a little about the flavor they start at 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:58.650
 give the various votes if I had to judge 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:01.440
 this product based on its name 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.900
 that is to say the sausage would allow which 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.270
 not classified because it does not remember 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.150
 absolutely the sausage 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:13.340
 the idea is more precisely than a very booster 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:15.630
 much flavored evening so more time 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.900
 help yourself with the right pronunciation 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.510
 however it tastes good sincerely 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.820
 absolutely not bad taste but 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.410
 since it does not have the favor of 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.020
 sausage but more than a brussels e 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:31.440
 flavored in this case I can not 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.210
 give one by vote do a sufficiency 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.290
 because it does not get the result 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.990
 wanted 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:41.820
 as for quality 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.630
 price I paid exactly 99 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.310
 cents 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.130
 the product was in 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:50.010
 because the original price is one euro e 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.590
 99 so there is a 50 percent discount 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:55.220
 and compared to 99 cents 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:58.310
 obviously it's a very low price 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:01.520
 buy two sausages at 99 cents 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.660
 let's say maybe in some butcher 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.280
 particularly economical one could 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.280
 also succeed but in reality 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.800
 they are usually found at least at 8 10 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.840
 euro per kilo so all in all it is a 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.630
 good price however we return to the 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.390
 reasoning of before that is not 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:22.680
 sausages are frankfurters and therefore 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:24.210
 they have a price more or less in this 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.270
 moment let's say i cheap of 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:29.550
 that of the rooster so I would give a six e 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:32.760
 always means for the problem for me 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:36.600
 in short, sausage point what 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:39.660
 it's about appearance for me 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.580
 even that usual reason is not always 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.890
 a good look because it does not go 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.530
 absolutely the idea of ​​sausage 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.330
 especially the inner part where the 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.730
 sausage prices cut with a knife 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:53.910
 so we have a fruit product 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:57.510
 absolutely no ground has a good 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:59.760
 I'm waiting for what concerns time 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.680
 of preparation instead for that there is 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.420
 very fast we have practically a 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.960
 ready-made product takes just two minutes 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:08.880
 so I would give them a good grade 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.730
 because they really prepare themselves in 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.110
 very little time though if we count 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:15.330
 which are similar lewis tel 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.160
 obviously more preparation time 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:20.010
 or less is the league but compared to 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.440
 a sausage and much faster then 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:27.460
 my general vote for this product is 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:29.590
 a 66 and a half but not because 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.900
 all in if you have a bad taste but 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.520
 because that's not what's written on it 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.669
 for me it doesn't even come close 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.410
 far from the idea of ​​sausage 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:40.449
 so if you are looking for tasty brussels 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:43.630
 this product is for you 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:46.030
 Otherwise I hope this review will 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:48.310
 a kiss is useful to all and see you 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:51.509
 at the next video review on Thursday
