00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
of the of the hit detection that we have

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.380 
of the of the hit detection that we have
if<00:02:58.890> you<00:02:59.040> take<00:02:59.250> a<00:02:59.280> sharp<00:02:59.640> weapon<00:03:00.000> and<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:00.209> land

if you take a sharp weapon and you land

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.270 
if you take a sharp weapon and you land
it<00:03:00.510> on<00:03:00.599> a<00:03:00.660> joint<00:03:00.989> that<00:03:01.319> limb<00:03:01.560> will<00:03:01.829> come<00:03:02.099> off

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
it on a joint that limb will come off

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.869 
it on a joint that limb will come off
hopefully<00:03:03.239> we<00:03:03.329> get<00:03:03.420> to<00:03:03.569> see<00:03:03.720> that<00:03:03.900> here<00:03:04.879> and

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
hopefully we get to see that here and

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.789 
hopefully we get to see that here and
like<00:03:06.420> I<00:03:06.540> said<00:03:06.599> the<00:03:06.870> attacks<00:03:07.200> are<00:03:07.379> real<00:03:07.560> time

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
like I said the attacks are real time

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.710 
like I said the attacks are real time
it's<00:03:08.250> all<00:03:08.430> real<00:03:08.610> time<00:03:08.849> you're<00:03:09.060> controlling<00:03:09.450> it

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
and the same thing with the blocks it's

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.369 
and the same thing with the blocks it's
fully<00:03:11.670> directional<00:03:12.299> you<00:03:12.660> have<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:13.019> aim<00:03:13.200> your

can<00:03:15.660> you<00:03:15.989> can<00:03:16.200> attack<00:03:16.680> people's<00:03:16.980> heads<00:03:17.160> and

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
can you can attack people's heads and

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.619 
can you can attack people's heads and
they'll<00:03:17.430> duck<00:03:17.610> underneath<00:03:17.910> them<00:03:18.150> stand<00:03:18.450> back

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629

going at it the nights are the heavier

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.559 
going at it the nights are the heavier
