00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.860
 annoyed about it or his criticism 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.350
 at the indie bundle and general the 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.930
 publisher electronic arts his opinion 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.840
 to microsoft, however, looks a bit 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.570
 otherwise, he still raged in 2012 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.870
 against the same and said please stop 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.460
 ruining the pc as an open platform 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.590
 Now calls microsoft as one 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.870
 Great something scary American 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.820
 company with its secrets said but 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.020
 also that working with them very much 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.939
 would make fun 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.220
 But now circulating, according to the 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.630
 renowned wall street journals which 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.549
 refers to an insider 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.340
 possible deal between microsoft and 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.380
 mojang at a $ 2 billion 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.939
 microsoft seems to be taking over 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.729
 want to let company cost 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.530
 however, neither from mojang nor from 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.270
 Microsoft has a statement on this 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.880
 Message given was accurate 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.040
 details continue to be unknown fact only 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.470
 that minecraft with over 50 million 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.810
 sales probably one of the most successful 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.090
 Games is ever and the sum of 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.060
 by no means two billion dollars 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.970
 utopian would also be strange that 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.130
 loud bloomberg.com even markus person 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.140
 even the deal should have suggested 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.880
 So this trade should actually be 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.009
 go beyond the stage itself is personal 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.689

 if it buy minecraft or mojang 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.410
 would change 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.850
 they would sell more merchandise 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.040
