00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:25.129
 history knows a lot of reliable facts 

00:00:25.129 --> 00:00:27.849
 when the civilized world asserted itself 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:29.899
 wars not even because 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:32.769
 that there was no choice but for the money spheres 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:34.530
 resource impacts 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.810
 their territories 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.930
 and no one is considered with 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.930
 human lives after all 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.750
 the universe of this world yes it's just shit 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.030
 this niche cattle distributed to be 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.000
 pawns winning 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.220
 the mighty of this world 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.160
 or otherwise did not give 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.160
 so it was so eat drink 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.180
 but this is me from the very gentlemen that the game is on 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.230
 which fell my mind today 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.260
 if anything else like a global war 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.680
 between the two factions subjected to the rocky in 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.430
 each 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.150
 here not only ideology rules the ball 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.890
 rather 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.700
 technical capacity and to be precise 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.400
 then a unique july fare inherent in each 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.100
 of the parties to the conflict is the name 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.450
 new world war 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.790
 Yes, gentlemen commanders, she studied 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.100
 following judgment earlier in the world 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.049
 multiplayer with entertainment 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:33.960
 pulled and strategies 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.280
 although not quite a classic look 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.600
 than tell a little later 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.970
 let's go over the basics 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.340
 as already mentioned 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.890
 introducing due chance two 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.620
 warring factions 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.200
 mated down 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.219
 and I will not name the above 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:51.490
 Aspects 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.409
 someone did not like something 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.189
 Someone else wanted something else 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.800
 party policy and so on 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.000
 and as noted above country selection 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.610
 predetermines a set of combat units 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.060
 for each faction he has his 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.099
 after which the game throws in 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.319
 epicenter of all really 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.420
 a little bit 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.579
 she is all mother 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:16.979
 war is here everywhere and for what territory 

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:19.259
 catch and choose you 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:20.379
 and only you 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.139
 but the choice does not predetermine 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:24.309
 only the card design but also the mode 

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:26.899
 Someone quite a bit from 

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:28.579
 classic standoff 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:30.429
 ending with specific 

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:33.109
 defensive commissions or not 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:35.079
 survival families 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:37.069
 under this heading list and 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.129
 Xenia will not be described 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:41.370
 it is enough that they are marked 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.559
 diversity 

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:44.069
 also getting short 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.769
 and on the other functions and therefore 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:46.779
 lobby 

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:48.789
 the specifics of the game has to 

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:51.679
 to build alone am don't need 

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:53.859
 all technology is predetermined 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:55.439
 in advance in the hangar 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:57.809
 that is, the starting composition of the player equipment 

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:59.769
 determines that in advance 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.540
 in the game you can only switch between 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.689
 pre-selected sets 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:05.419
 among other things, the technique can 

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:07.930
 subject to madrid 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.790
 how to buy modules 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.890
 Kate pumps the tree of talents 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.890
 moonshine player 

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:45.259
 and here you figured out all the subtleties 

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:48.299
 the choice of technology and the specifics of the modes and 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.489
 go on the ramp but in his rage 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.159
 the foe who does not share at all 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:56.199
 point of view have your top management 

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:58.819
 why should be eliminated by 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:00.109
 soon 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:02.119
 at this stage I have your own personal 

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:05.119
 views with a partial description of the somoni game 

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:06.790
 I'll start with 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.759
 that my disappointment knew no bounds 

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:11.609
 even before exploring this game 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.799
 I heard a lot about what they say 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:15.750
 full 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.370
 and his march has clearly incorporated all 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.199
 the best of conventional strategies 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:23.199
 and transferred it so 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.820
 everything turned out 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:25.800
 otherwise 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.719
 observant already understood 

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:29.969
 but no construction go cracks 

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:31.709
 you will not be allowed to develop during 

00:04:31.709 --> 00:04:34.370
 The battlefield will not allow you to strengthen your base 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.510
 and even the equipment will be ordered 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.080
 from nowhere 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.439
 certainly not without warfare 

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:43.300
 and you won't stay at least until 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.569
 There is a special district account. 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:47.590
 received for destruction 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:48.599
 adversary 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:51.629
 if briefly who else have we come into play the system 

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:53.240
 and currency 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.810
 as soon as the vehicles destroyed you 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.069
 if you have lava, order it 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:04:59.309
 repeatedly 

00:04:59.309 --> 00:05:01.779
 after a few seconds of her descents on 

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:04.580
 parachute on the local daughter landing 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.860
 if she is not captured by the enemy 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:07.760
 otherwise 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:08.750
 ride the walls 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.009
 what's left 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:12.300
 you can still harden for this yourself 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.830
 Crashes can take multiple tunnels 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.789
 or their analogues 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:18.789
 but still a full-fledged construction of its base 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:22.059
 here and received instead of the usual 

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:22.870
 strategies 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.259
 just tactical 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:27.509
 you will not believe but most of all I play 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:28.749
 reminded 

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:31.749
 FC news which include all sorts 

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:33.800
 League of Legends 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.699
 imagine that instead of a hero 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:38.550
 you and a set of vehicles that go 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.080
 always in a heap, see each other in groups and 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.270
 there is no need, and I am special and nothing but fancy 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:45.469
 furnishing substitute 

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:47.279
 futuristic in the best traditions 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:49.300
 skeleton apocalyptic 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.939
 entourage 

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:53.889
 here you get the endov may chance 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:55.509
 where to be constantly 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:57.530
 balance between attack and 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.860
 retreat 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:00.759
 no one 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:03.099
 most often from each country 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:04.419
 several players 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:07.039
 here so naturally and logically follows 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:09.700
 the conclusion that gimpu alegre is not at all 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.870
 as it seemed earlier promises that it 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.219
 even they minus 

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:17.409
 wanted very much 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:19.050
 see exactly full 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.229
 global strategy 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:23.089
 if only patterns like 

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:24.739
 and shakes directly 

00:06:24.739 --> 00:06:25.939
 graphics in the game 

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:28.250
 when you played your last strategy 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.500
 five years ago 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.719
 and I do not remember how she was called 

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:34.270
 the graphics were better there 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.169
 understood he was optimized engine 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:38.340
 go there teasing 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.770
 hurt that now the truth will say something 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.770
 Here we get in fact Neda strategy and 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.440
 also very specific 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.180
 master plan and all this is mediocre 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.330
 wrappers 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.569
 Although to say that the game is not a bad language 

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:53.349
 will turn just once again 

00:06:53.349 --> 00:06:55.449
 promises were much 

00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:57.320
 overpriced and amid them 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.339
 The result is pale fake 

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:02.479
 however will throw back promises 

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:04.320
 and looking at the game as it is 

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.479
 the conclusion suggests itself 

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:08.960
 the game will find its audience but much 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.369
 less than it could 

00:07:11.369 --> 00:07:13.549
 today decide to deviate and 

00:07:13.549 --> 00:07:14.569
 stayed with you 

00:07:14.569 --> 00:07:16.610
 alone with thoughts in which 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.289
 have appeared and which you already hurry 

00:07:19.289 --> 00:07:20.040
 remained 

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.390
 in the comments osvaldo was 13 and 

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:24.870
 a sober look at the game m due chances 

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:25.440
 see you
