how I train apps usually at the end of a

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.830 
how I train apps usually at the end of a
cardio<00:00:10.980> session<00:00:11.400> early<00:00:11.940> morning<00:00:12.330> but<00:00:12.780> I'm

cardio session early morning but I'm

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.660 
cardio session early morning but I'm
going<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.019> show<00:00:13.110> you<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.620> exercises<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.610> the

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
going to show you the exercises and the

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.670 
going to show you the exercises and the
techniques<00:00:15.240> that<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.509> incorporate<00:00:15.719> into<00:00:16.560> these

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
techniques that I incorporate into these

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.830 
techniques that I incorporate into these
abdominal<00:00:17.070> routines<00:00:17.670> so<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.180> pretty<00:00:18.420> much<00:00:18.510> do

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
abdominal routines so I pretty much do

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.800 
abdominal routines so I pretty much do
five<00:00:19.500> six<00:00:19.859> days<00:00:20.070> in<00:00:20.640> seven<00:00:21.029> days<00:00:21.150> or<00:00:21.390> week

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
five six days in seven days or week

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.509 
five six days in seven days or week
certainly<00:00:22.260> during<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.680> last<00:00:22.859> four<00:00:23.130> weeks<00:00:23.160> of

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
certainly during the last four weeks of

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.420 
certainly during the last four weeks of
that<00:00:23.970> competition<00:00:24.240> prep<00:00:24.740> first<00:00:25.740> one<00:00:25.949> lower

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
that competition prep first one lower

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.250 
that competition prep first one lower
abdominals<00:00:27.060> so<00:00:27.510> I'm<00:00:27.570> going<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.779> start<00:00:27.990> with

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
abdominals so I'm going to start with

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.580 
abdominals so I'm going to start with
the<00:00:28.410> lower<00:00:28.619> area<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.760> this<00:00:30.119> all<00:00:31.050> elusive

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
the lower area of this all elusive

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.709 
the lower area of this all elusive
six-pack<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.969> main<00:00:33.120> movement<00:00:33.540> is

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
six-pack and the main movement is

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.049 
six-pack and the main movement is
there's<00:00:34.680> two<00:00:34.829> party<00:00:35.430> one<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.880> breathing

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
there's two party one is the breathing

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.610 
there's two party one is the breathing
and<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.600> second<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.140> movement<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.559> the

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
and the second is the movement of the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.250 
and the second is the movement of the
body<00:00:37.860> so<00:00:38.550> by<00:00:38.730> breathing<00:00:39.260> out<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:41.989> contract<00:00:42.989> all

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
body so by breathing out I contract all

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.200 
body so by breathing out I contract all
of<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.469> abdominal<00:00:43.620> bands<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.700> tightens

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
of the abdominal bands that tightens

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.619 
of the abdominal bands that tightens
that<00:00:45.660> mid<00:00:45.870> region<00:00:46.820> now<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.879> tie<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.450> in<00:00:48.600> with

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
that mid region now to tie that in with

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.630 
that mid region now to tie that in with
that<00:00:48.870> movement<00:00:49.289> I'm<00:00:49.890> going<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.129> are<00:00:50.250> hanging

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
that movement I'm going to are hanging

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.290 
that movement I'm going to are hanging
new<00:00:50.969> ways<00:00:51.149> my<00:00:51.840> hips<00:00:52.140> come<00:00:52.860> forwards<00:00:53.399> which

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
new ways my hips come forwards which

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.270 
new ways my hips come forwards which
contract<00:00:55.260> it's<00:00:55.410> kind<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.649> like<00:00:55.829> close<00:00:56.070> a

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
contract it's kind of like close a

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.939 
contract it's kind of like close a
c-section<00:00:56.850> for<00:00:57.750> my<00:00:57.840> hips<00:00:58.079> my<00:00:58.379> shoulders<00:00:58.770> urge

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
c-section for my hips my shoulders urge

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.360 
c-section for my hips my shoulders urge
that<00:00:59.930> movement<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.079> it's<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.680> breathing<00:01:02.129> more

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
that movement so it's the breathing more

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.310 
that movement so it's the breathing more
importantly<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.850> exhaling<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.629> that

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
importantly the exhaling and that

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.200 
importantly the exhaling and that
muscular<00:01:04.920> contraction<00:01:05.489> combined<00:01:06.030> together

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
muscular contraction combined together

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.510 
muscular contraction combined together
which<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.140> really<00:01:07.439> going<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.590> help<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.979> focus

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
which is really going to help you focus

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:43.590 
which is really going to help you focus
on<00:01:08.880> bringing<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.510> conditioning<00:01:10.049> out

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.570 

so<00:01:44.600> I<00:01:44.630> brought<00:01:44.900> my<00:01:44.960> knees<00:01:45.260> up<00:01:45.500> side-to-side<00:01:46.130> on

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
so I brought my knees up side-to-side on

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.430 
so I brought my knees up side-to-side on
that<00:01:46.760> one<00:01:46.910> just<00:01:47.540> to<00:01:47.660> engage<00:01:47.810> a<00:01:47.960> little<00:01:48.230> bit

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
that one just to engage a little bit

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.370 
that one just to engage a little bit
more<00:01:48.590> of<00:01:48.770> these<00:01:48.920> lower<00:01:49.430> obliques<00:01:50.330> the<00:01:51.020> tie-in

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
more of these lower obliques the tie-in

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.830 
more of these lower obliques the tie-in
and<00:01:51.530> kind<00:01:51.740> of<00:01:51.830> frame<00:01:51.980> the<00:01:52.100> abdominals

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
and kind of frame the abdominals

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.940 
and kind of frame the abdominals
sometimes<00:01:53.840> I<00:01:54.110> would<00:01:54.230> do<00:01:54.320> them<00:01:54.470> straight<00:01:54.770> leg

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
sometimes I would do them straight leg

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.950 
sometimes I would do them straight leg
but<00:01:55.250> this<00:01:55.340> puts<00:01:55.550> a<00:01:55.670> lot<00:01:55.790> more<00:01:55.820> strain<00:01:56.240> around

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
but this puts a lot more strain around

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.630 
but this puts a lot more strain around
the<00:01:57.050> lower<00:01:57.260> back<00:01:57.500> it<00:01:57.920> typically<00:01:58.280> doesn't

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
the lower back it typically doesn't

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.730 
the lower back it typically doesn't
involve<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.150> abdominal<00:01:59.630> structure<00:02:00.050> quite<00:02:00.590> as

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
involve the abdominal structure quite as

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.950 
involve the abdominal structure quite as
much<00:02:00.890> as<00:02:01.100> when<00:02:01.250> you<00:02:01.340> bring<00:02:01.490> your<00:02:01.610> knees<00:02:01.790> up<00:02:01.960> so

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
much as when you bring your knees up so

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.550 
much as when you bring your knees up so
30<00:02:03.740> even<00:02:04.220> 40<00:02:04.400> 50<00:02:05.210> repetitions<00:02:05.420> providing<00:02:06.380> you

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
30 even 40 50 repetitions providing you

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.590 
30 even 40 50 repetitions providing you
can<00:02:06.740> keep<00:02:06.950> that<00:02:07.100> same<00:02:07.400> technique<00:02:07.790> and<00:02:08.000> keep

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
can keep that same technique and keep

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.170 
can keep that same technique and keep
your<00:02:08.750> form<00:02:09.020> on<00:02:09.230> every<00:02:09.679> rep<00:02:09.890> doesn't<00:02:10.670> matter<00:02:10.970> if

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
your form on every rep doesn't matter if

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.490 
your form on every rep doesn't matter if
you're<00:02:11.330> trying<00:02:11.510> to<00:02:11.630> go<00:02:11.720> for<00:02:11.870> numbers<00:02:12.230> where

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
you're trying to go for numbers where

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.680 
you're trying to go for numbers where
the<00:02:12.530> muscles<00:02:12.950> aren't<00:02:13.250> working<00:02:13.760> remember<00:02:14.480> it's

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
the muscles aren't working remember it's

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.450 
the muscles aren't working remember it's
every<00:02:14.810> rep<00:02:15.170> that<00:02:15.350> counts<00:02:15.710> so<00:02:15.800> focus<00:02:16.190> on<00:02:16.310> your

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
every rep that counts so focus on your

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.730 
every rep that counts so focus on your
breathing<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:17.300> technique<00:02:17.720> and<00:02:17.900> do<00:02:18.500> as<00:02:18.620> many

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
breathing the technique and do as many

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.980 
breathing the technique and do as many
as<00:02:18.890> you<00:02:19.040> can<00:02:19.280> before<00:02:19.880> moving<00:02:20.390> straight<00:02:20.660> on<00:02:20.840> to

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
as you can before moving straight on to

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.500 
as you can before moving straight on to
that<00:02:21.110> next<00:02:21.350> abdominal<00:02:22.220> exercise<00:02:22.700> let's<00:02:23.360> take

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
that next abdominal exercise let's take

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.140 
that next abdominal exercise let's take
a<00:02:23.540> look<00:02:23.780> at<00:02:23.870> that<00:02:23.960> one
