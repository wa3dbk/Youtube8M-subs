00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
connect this wirelessly as you can see I

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:20.080 
connect this wirelessly as you can see I
have<00:01:10.520> this<00:01:14.020> now<00:01:15.020> I<00:01:15.079> can<00:01:15.380> control<00:01:16.119> and<00:01:19.090> this

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
have this now I can control and this

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:28.080 
have this now I can control and this
house<00:01:21.189> looted<00:01:22.960> and<00:01:23.960> you<00:01:24.140> can<00:01:24.350> see<00:01:24.999> soundly

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.880 

course<00:01:30.729> connected<00:01:32.079> it's<00:01:33.079> like<00:01:33.259> an<00:01:33.439> airplay

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
course connected it's like an airplay

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.800 
course connected it's like an airplay
but<00:01:34.490> this<00:01:34.729> is<00:01:34.880> more<00:01:36.789> better<00:01:37.789> than<00:01:38.179> airplay

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
but this is more better than airplay

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.209
