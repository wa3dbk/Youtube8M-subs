hey guys captain here bringing you day

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.480 
hey guys captain here bringing you day
12<00:00:04.950> of<00:00:05.100> the<00:00:05.220> captain's<00:00:05.609> challenge<00:00:07.040> so<00:00:08.040> today<00:00:08.460> I

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
12 of the captain's challenge so today I

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.220 
12 of the captain's challenge so today I
recreated<00:00:09.059> something<00:00:09.690> that<00:00:09.840> will<00:00:09.929> probably

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
recreated something that will probably

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.919 
recreated something that will probably
be<00:00:10.290> familiar<00:00:10.740> to<00:00:10.769> a<00:00:10.889> lot<00:00:11.040> of<00:00:11.070> you<00:00:11.420> it's<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.660> like

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
be familiar to a lot of you it's a like

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.910 
be familiar to a lot of you it's a like
a<00:00:12.960> Wii<00:00:13.200> Remote<00:00:13.969> it<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.990> same<00:00:16.199> size<00:00:16.410> as<00:00:16.710> the

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
a Wii Remote it is the same size as the

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.010 
a Wii Remote it is the same size as the
other<00:00:16.949> one<00:00:17.510> here's<00:00:18.510> one<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:18.750> have<00:00:18.990> for

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
other one here's one I have for

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.980 
other one here's one I have for
comparison<00:00:20.090> you'll<00:00:21.090> notice<00:00:21.390> they're<00:00:21.600> the

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
comparison you'll notice they're the

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.950 
comparison you'll notice they're the
same<00:00:22.199> height<00:00:23.630> approximately<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.720> same

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
same height approximately the same

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:32.139 
same height approximately the same
thickness<00:00:27.199> same<00:00:28.199> width<00:00:29.480> and<00:00:30.500> the<00:00:31.500> only<00:00:31.740> really

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
thickness same width and the only really

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.459 
thickness same width and the only really
thing<00:00:33.149> that's<00:00:33.390> different<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.140> course<00:00:34.320> that

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
thing that's different is of course that

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.110 
thing that's different is of course that
the<00:00:34.559> buttons<00:00:34.920> don't<00:00:35.130> feel<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.640> same<00:00:35.850> because

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
the buttons don't feel the same because

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.270 
the buttons don't feel the same because
you<00:00:36.210> can't<00:00:36.420> really<00:00:36.540> press<00:00:37.050> them<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:38.040> some

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
you can't really press them and it some

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.000 
you can't really press them and it some
of<00:00:38.309> them<00:00:38.489> are<00:00:38.809> spaced<00:00:39.809> or<00:00:40.200> rather<00:00:40.440> aligned<00:00:40.829> a

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
of them are spaced or rather aligned a

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.930 
of them are spaced or rather aligned a
little<00:00:41.280> bit<00:00:41.399> differently<00:00:42.050> just<00:00:43.050> because<00:00:43.350> of

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
little bit differently just because of

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.060 
little bit differently just because of
some<00:00:44.940> certain<00:00:45.210> limitations<00:00:45.960> because<00:00:46.950> I'm

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
some certain limitations because I'm

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.400 
some certain limitations because I'm
using<00:00:47.280> Legos<00:00:47.760> but<00:00:48.539> overall<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.899> still<00:00:48.989> tried<00:00:49.379> to

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
using Legos but overall I still tried to

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.060 
using Legos but overall I still tried to
place<00:00:49.680> them<00:00:49.860> as<00:00:49.980> best<00:00:50.190> as<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.370> could<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:52.070> actually

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
place them as best as I could I actually

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.180 
place them as best as I could I actually
made<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.489> with<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.809> studs<00:00:55.140> facing<00:00:55.800> the

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
made it with the studs facing the

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.510 
made it with the studs facing the
backside<00:00:56.699> because<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.629> had<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> lot<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.050> these

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
backside because I had a lot of these

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.060 
backside because I had a lot of these
slopes<00:00:59.539> like<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.719> roof<00:01:00.930> tile<00:01:01.199> slopes<00:01:01.559> in

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
slopes like the roof tile slopes in

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.170 
slopes like the roof tile slopes in
white<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.449> had<00:01:03.690> very<00:01:04.129> few<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.549> couldn't<00:01:06.000> even

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
white and I had very few I couldn't even

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.830 
white and I had very few I couldn't even
find<00:01:06.479> any<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.650> other<00:01:07.799> kind<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.780> you<00:01:09.780> know

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
find any of the other kind of you know

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.070 
find any of the other kind of you know
the<00:01:10.080> inverse<00:01:10.619> slopes<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.510> might<00:01:12.510> have<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.720> few

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
the inverse slopes I might have a few

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.280 
the inverse slopes I might have a few
but<00:01:14.210> honestly<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:15.479> don't<00:01:15.570> think<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.080> have<00:01:16.259> that

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
but honestly I don't think I have that

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.280 
but honestly I don't think I have that
many<00:01:16.680> in<00:01:16.950> white<00:01:18.619> so<00:01:20.540> you<00:01:21.540> know<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.659> basically<00:01:22.200> I

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
many in white so you know I basically I

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.280 
many in white so you know I basically I
made<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.590> work<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:23.040> used<00:01:23.250> some<00:01:23.520> plates<00:01:24.270> here<00:01:24.780> so

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
made it work I used some plates here so

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.469 
made it work I used some plates here so
that<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.650> don't<00:01:25.830> have<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.250> deep<00:01:26.759> effect<00:01:27.150> from

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
that you don't have the deep effect from

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.499 
that you don't have the deep effect from
like<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.900> bricks<00:01:29.270> which<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.390> how<00:01:30.479> I

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
like the bricks which is how I

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.700 
like the bricks which is how I
originally<00:01:30.960> had<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.229> because<00:01:31.380> then<00:01:31.470> looked

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
originally had it because then looked

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.130 
originally had it because then looked
kind<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.009> ugly<00:01:32.189> so<00:01:33.030> instead<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.329> put<00:01:33.570> layer<00:01:33.990> of

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
kind of ugly so instead I put layer of

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.580 
kind of ugly so instead I put layer of
bricks<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:34.590> between<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.840> now<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:37.229> looks<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.470> lot

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
bricks in between and now it looks a lot

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.210 
bricks in between and now it looks a lot
nicer<00:01:37.860> on<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.189> surface<00:01:38.930> the<00:01:39.930> buttons<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.530> chose

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
nicer on the surface the buttons I chose

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.100 
nicer on the surface the buttons I chose
to<00:01:41.369> go<00:01:41.460> with<00:01:41.490> light<00:01:41.759> gray<00:01:42.060> because<00:01:42.899> white

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
to go with light gray because white

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.950 
to go with light gray because white
didn't<00:01:43.439> stand<00:01:43.680> out<00:01:43.770> too<00:01:44.009> well<00:01:44.540> and<00:01:45.540> overall<00:01:45.930> I

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
didn't stand out too well and overall I

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.090 
didn't stand out too well and overall I
think<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.350> whole<00:01:46.470> thing<00:01:46.619> turned<00:01:46.829> out<00:01:46.920> really

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
think the whole thing turned out really

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.370 
think the whole thing turned out really
nicely<00:01:47.340> also<00:01:48.180> as<00:01:48.420> for<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.689> little<00:01:48.899> B<00:01:49.049> button

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
nicely also as for the little B button

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.319 
nicely also as for the little B button
tried<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.070> make<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.310> slope<00:01:50.610> as<00:01:50.790> real<00:01:51.180> as

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
tried to make the slope as real as

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.819 
tried to make the slope as real as
possible<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:51.899> they<00:01:51.960> actually<00:01:52.079> feel<00:01:52.470> really

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
possible and they actually feel really

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.580 
possible and they actually feel really
similar<00:01:53.100> so<00:01:54.079> that's<00:01:55.079> about<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.409> then

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
similar so that's about it then

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.289 
similar so that's about it then
