00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.370
 m 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:55.030
 good afternoon days or nights in this 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.039
 video as it says the title of the same I'm going 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.199
 to give my opinion on the subject of the 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.210
 new generation of video games and 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:04.119
 why wiiu is the best option for 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.159
 this again I reiterate this is my mere 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.289
 opinion and that does not mean it's the 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:11.080
 absolute truth so without more 

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:13.539
 let's start with the video as everyone will know 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.640
 the exponential progress of the growth of 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:17.950
 technology has reached very high levels 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.080
 high and these are shown in the new 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.240
 innovations in the world of is from 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.920
 cell phones with all kinds of functions 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.110
 and applications to appliances 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.479
 appliances such as television sets 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.479
 high quality very powerful computers 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.100
 among others and as expected 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.289
 world of video games has not 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.940
 stayed behind since from the seventh 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:38.649
 generation you see that the consoles 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.140
 they really brought an innovation 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:43.509
 quite remarkable in all fields of 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.640
 the video games like the graphics the 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.039
 sound and so on but the companies that 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.259
 they make these consoles they still thought 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.330
 in the comfort of the client without seeing how 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.489
 exploit him to the last cent and 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.480
 trying to make him a little more life 

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:58.690
 easy so 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.700
 as did the xbox 360 the play 3 and the 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.200
 guild given that these consoles were 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.480
 made mainly for 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.060
 videogames maybe with some details 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.010
 extra like watching dvds or bluray but 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.530
 satisfactorily comply with their 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:13.600
 objective but unfortunately this 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.370
 the eighth generation of video games 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.560
 main consoles are no longer 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.390
 fulfilling that objective and they are 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.090
 focusing more on squeezing until the 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.290
 last cent of the consumer 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.510
 it's just enough to see the new 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.390
 policies that they wanted to implement 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.160
 in xbox one ips 4 where they wanted 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.800
 eradicate the second-hand market 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.720
 but fortunately these were 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.950
 removed due to the contempt of the 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.840
 fans still like that still the xbox one and ps 4 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.510
 they have a great way of fucking their 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.340
 fans they completely removed the re 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.010
 compatibility with the games of the 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.620
 previous consoles and that's the core 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.430
 of this video 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.440
 regardless of the catalog 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.450
 games that there is as it is possible that 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.090
 have removed the re compatibility with 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.310
 your previous consoles that's why 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.720
 I think that will you is the best option to 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.630
 see tell me why 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.390
 and ps4 did not put the option that 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.340
 read the disks of its predecessors or is 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.790
 I read that as you could spend some 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.980
 Digital form games from ps3 to ps 4 of 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.080
 the same way you could do with the xbox 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.450
 one but you would have to go back to 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.820
 buy in digital format and that to me is 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.890
 It does me an injustice if I already bought 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.360
 a game for my console because I have 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.900
 than to buy it back in version 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.790
 digital, even with a reduced price and 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.040
 do not tell me that because the design of the 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.959
 console prevents re-compatibility if 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.060
 those from sony and microsoft could well 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.400
 put on your consoles since the 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.110
 they were designing an option to be able 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.400
 read the games of the seventh generation 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:47.290
 just as he did for example the xbox 360 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.620
 that he could read the records of the first 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.170
 xbox and just like that did will you already 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.240
 that is at least if he thought since 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.730
 the console was designed to be able to read 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.920
 disks of the wii and normal and if we talk 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.750
 of the digital games only about 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.570
 certain games may be returned to 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.340
 buy not all but what if I 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.410
 I want to play titles like 'the asura's 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.630
 wrath or others like the alicia 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.940
 return that were very good titles 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.800
 but they did not have much success regarding 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.980
 sales believe they will have a version 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:20.080
 digital truth I do not think and if the 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.570
 they would cost the same as when 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:25.570
 buy them here in Mexico we use the 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:28.060
 pesos so it would cost about 700 pesos 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.950
 but again I reiterate that does not make me 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.500
 nothing just can say what they want 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.750
 of will you that your games are just for 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.000
 kids that is a tablet with buttons and 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.860
 levers but is the only one who thought of 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.780
 Do not take out every last cent of the 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.910
 consumer and he took the trouble to 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.280
 put re compatibility to your console 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.170
 since it went on sale so it's 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.360
 that's why will is the best console 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.550
 current since it focuses more on the 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.620
 video games and do not put other options 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.420
 like watch TV or record games already 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.940
 that for that you can use perfectly 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.970
 a computer without the need of 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.940
 spend on an xbox or ps4 console and if 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.650
 well these have more in quotes 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.960
 graphic power that's no excuse for 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.760
 do not put the re compatibility knowing 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.310
 that could perfectly have 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.920
 put and really if we think about it the 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:17.710
 innovation has not been much with xbox one 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:20.440
 s 4 really the graphical change is not 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.180
 so remarkable and spectacular at least with 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.490
 the wii you if you see a good change 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.800
 regarding your graphics if we do the 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.600
 comparison with the wii before 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.060
 end I want to say that the games 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.430
 digital of the wild and have to be 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.400
 necessarily digital because most 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.470
 of the games are from nintendo 64 and the 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.750
 super nintendo and those if you could not 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.760
 put in the we you console since they are 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.560
 very old cartridges and they are not in 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.140
 disk format like today 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.360
 well that's all from my side I hope and 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.040
 the video you liked, remember that 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.410
 it's just my point of view and I wanted 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.900
 share it if you are in favor of 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.940
 sony or microsoft is fine I do not deny that 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.290
 if they have their advantages over nintendo 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.450
 but if you are going to comment 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:03.520
 please try not to offend because 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:05.830
 We all deserve our opinion to be 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.320
 respected so you agree with her 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:11.520
 or not happy holidays 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.520
 thanks for watching the video
