so<00:01:55.170> as<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.350> can<00:01:55.439> see<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:56.100> coverage<00:01:56.610> is

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
so as you can see the coverage is

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.959 
so as you can see the coverage is
definitely<00:01:57.149> building<00:01:57.600> up<00:01:57.920> once<00:01:58.920> i<00:01:59.219> get<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.880> the

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
definitely building up once i get to the

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.389 
definitely building up once i get to the
last<00:02:00.210> couple<00:02:00.450> stages<00:02:00.719> i<00:02:01.140> start<00:02:01.439> just<00:02:01.799> dabbing

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
last couple stages i start just dabbing

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.639 
last couple stages i start just dabbing
the<00:02:02.759> foundation<00:02:03.270> on<00:02:03.479> rather<00:02:03.869> than<00:02:04.229> any

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
the foundation on rather than any

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.830 
the foundation on rather than any
blending<00:02:05.399> because<00:02:06.000> that's<00:02:06.180> really<00:02:06.659> going<00:02:06.780> to

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
blending because that's really going to

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.190 
blending because that's really going to
add<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.049> lot<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:07.770> pigmentation<00:02:08.840> into<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:09.869> small

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.900 
add a lot of pigmentation into a small
area<00:02:10.229> which<00:02:11.069> is<00:02:11.220> what<00:02:11.400> i<00:02:11.430> really<00:02:11.730> want
