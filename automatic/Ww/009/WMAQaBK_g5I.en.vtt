 the great 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:20.060
 Everyone was looking forward to Neusässer I know what was there should be agreed 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.130
 be and then the slap in the face that's a week later 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:28.329
 then the previous date was announced 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:32.500
 Well, I do not want to be able to take part in July 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.290

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.900
 Parks fixe does not have to or does not want to with so much with game July so the game still 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.850
 with hundreds of the BAGSO 129 also with some DAX still percent on the examiners 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.120

 You sure want to have sources and so on, so can Mike 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.390
 hard work 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.390

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.210
 eyes go so you write German 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.380
 And yes, even the mercenary gives this team with them the motto 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.479

 look in the source catalog of these 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.470
 To make sure we keep it, the oil has not been moved 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.159
 But I also do it all alone for all the teams 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.800
 we have to stop in Dirk 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.040
 Pierre Paquin and so on «the tension increases more and more then in the 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.080
