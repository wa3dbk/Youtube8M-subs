the<00:00:00.420> last<00:00:00.630> thing<00:00:00.960> we<00:00:01.110> need<00:00:01.140> to<00:00:01.350> get<00:00:01.709> our<00:00:01.890> cannon

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
the last thing we need to get our cannon

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.249 
the last thing we need to get our cannon
working<00:00:02.669> is<00:00:02.820> to<00:00:03.120> make<00:00:03.419> sure<00:00:03.449> it's<00:00:03.780> drawn<00:00:04.049> on

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
working is to make sure it's drawn on

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.920 
working is to make sure it's drawn on
the<00:00:04.380> screen<00:00:04.879> like<00:00:05.879> our<00:00:06.029> background<00:00:06.509> texture

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
the screen like our background texture

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.080 
the screen like our background texture
we<00:00:07.589> will<00:00:07.710> make<00:00:07.890> this<00:00:08.069> happen<00:00:08.130> in<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.880> draw

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
we will make this happen in the draw

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.009 
we will make this happen in the draw
