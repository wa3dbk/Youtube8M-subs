00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.099
 hello everyone we find 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.450
 today the pears guesde reduced and 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.610
 half marc lieb routine 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.089
 basically I filmed you my routine 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.880
 makeup and morning hair care 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.130
 so that's the day I wanted 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.689
 film this video it was 8:30 9am 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.789
 I was really in no hurry 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.099
 so like everyone in the morning I 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.289
 struggling to get up and after being well 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.910
 stretched until was a little bit my 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.560
 phone I will go on the networks 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.420
 social facebook twitter 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.520
 instagram that finally a little bit like 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.600
 everyone and it's gone 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.460
 the hour of walk ouch 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.750
 so I do not wash my hair every 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.290
 days I look around all 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.850
 three days 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.829
 but for this road china I like the 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.649
 to do so I used shampoos 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.420
 net surya of human flesh on earth 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.760
 Then I will apply a balm of 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.010
 at choir and as a shower gel I am 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.690
 super happy to play six and a gel 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.280
 diop shower that I found in France 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.809
 who are super good and that's the guillou 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.340
 I'm like that hot there where 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.320
 I get dressed by snapping my fingers 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.049
 do not ask me my little secret I do not 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.270
 not say now I'll be able to 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.640
 pass amaru care faces have everything 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.540
 first i'm going to apply the ddm l of 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.000
 at clinic 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.740
 I will then apply my outline 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.780
 eyes the owl that of chelsea 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.299
 shiseido and yes I agree 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.770
 normally need pat me but I 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.229
 apply a little to rabies 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.610
 and to finish I'm going to put my 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:32.430
 day cream so it's a cream 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:34.920
 moisturizer from bioderma and there we 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.930
 go through a bit of a boring stage 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.280
 I wanted to agree I want to come big 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.200
 and my hair they even have rather 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.250
 well with the conditioner that we 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.439
 oar it is rather effective 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.850
 so I just brush the trouble 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.729
 with my gang 10 hours 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.299
 then after I'm going to come apply a 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.580
 kind of aid it actually okay 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.470
 to allow it to be rather antic felt 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.530
 fork all that all this is a product 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.540
 That I like 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.740
 so I apply of course all 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.759
 my hair legs a little bit 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:11.000
 everywhere in fact is there by cons it's 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.700
 kind the stage I hate the most at 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.770
 world this is the stage of the routine that me 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.290
 Drunk the more I dry my hair 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.970
 it's a pro kind a half hour it's 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.430
 unbearable and in fact I think they 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.440
 are too long and I have a little bit 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.000
 so tired besides I think it's 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.290
 one of the last videos you see with 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.640
 long hair I want to me 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.769
 cut and I want to make a square 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.140
 so as you can see I was leaving 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.730
 h a little bit to larache i just want to 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.170
 they dry quickly it's all 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.519
 that I ask once I finally have 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.019
 ended with this story of his 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.209
 hair I leave my hair alone 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.769
 just put a clamp and we can 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.959
 go to the make-up stage 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:51.200
 so I'll take my chair back 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.930
 Germanic keskin and with my brush 45 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.860
 from sephora is exactly the same 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.530
 than usual 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.910
 and then you will see frankly my 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.880
 everyday makeup there is 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.989
 nothing complicated is even ultra fast 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.730
 ultra simple 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.560
 it's really basic makeup 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.030
 but in fact I'm not really 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.170
 style to take my head a mesh 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.280
 everyday must go fast 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.049
 it's fast and pretty then I'm going 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.870
 come and take my under eye circles of the moment 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.640
 so this is the pro length of mac 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.799
 I put on my fingertips Game 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.720
 just warm up a little bit the material 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.370
 then I have it on my little buttons 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.200
 my little imperfections every 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.700
 little things that jean-luc hide and 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.780
 with what reassures my fingers yes 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.000
 because I admit that I have a small 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.030
 little too much I'm going to camouflage them 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.030
 dark circles 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.600
 I want to come powdered with the powder 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.430
 transparent from nars if they 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.780
 listen to what I love and reflect hyper 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.730
 well the light she is really 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.300
 invisible to the naked eye and she is very 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.580
 very fine and then I go to Lille 2 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.050
 May and preferred this is a step a 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.000
 little bit boring to realize I you 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.710
 the agreement but it changes everything everything 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.450
 and I really can not do without 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.820
 so as usual I will use 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.400
 the colored eyebrow pencil stage 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.350
 from mac people but not so much 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.100
 it's more about redefining it and 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.100
 fill a little bit 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.780
 and then there is going to be able to pass 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.790
 to the eyes so here I take the pallet 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.560
 semi sweet of all faces but frankly 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.960
 I would have taken any she can 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.450
 the being is just that it was the one that 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.220
 was closest to me so suddenly 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.900
 I take a dark brown lighthouse but 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.880
 as I tell you any woman 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.440
 dark brown will make the sphere people 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.140
 deposit a little bit at the level 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.240
 hard does it have lower and kind fade 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:47.420
 all to the fingers for not having this 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.130
 feeling of just trek oms posed 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.620
 to have a little more doubt 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.990
 blurred and then I have a pique my 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:58.490
 mascara of the moment that is lash mascara 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.840
 sensational from meys beline and 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.880
 here is my eye makeup is 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.680
 completed which I had foreseen his 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.490
 makeup really ultra simple or 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.350
 very fast 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.060
 now i'm going to add a little 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.620
 touch of blush so this one is the 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.480
 brand bluff 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.160
 iluv make-up I have on the site 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.920
 meyclub revolution 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.720
 so I apply flying kills little on 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.940
 my cheekbones with a paintbrush 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.190
 them and the efs and then I resume my 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.160
 big powder brush to fade the 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.540
 all 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.820
 we will now go to the lips that 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:31.040
 is the last step of makeup and 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.450
 for once I used the book the water 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.270
 d' chez or is a moisturizing balm 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:37.610
 which adapts to the natural color of 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:40.420
 your lips and who's going that was worth tinted 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:44.060
 and in fact it's a product I love 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:46.280
 and then we go back to the hair 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:50.510
 have understood this is the part I like 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:52.880
 less frankly it takes me the head of 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.530
 to dry myself and a half it's hair so 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.590
 I really could skip this step 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:59.150
 I would do it great pleasure only down 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.490
 only it's a little bit just not 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.000
 take out the hair the hair not 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.940
 coiffed 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.760
 so I used my sister bed so 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.830
 it seems to me that this is the style 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.600
 eur52 at ghd and as we can see 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.720
 on the pictures I do not apply 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.000
 I really take enough locks 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.430
 coarse and then here I am reading a little 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.169
 everywhere good everywhere that's what it is 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.450
 for every day after I split into 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:24.919
 evening where I would have had something important 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.930
 I will have them list and I would have taken my 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:29.390
 time then I would have buckled but there 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.400
 for every day I really take 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.710
 not my time and I do not linger 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.450
 too much on the subject more than a small 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.970
 touch of perfume a meter and for the 

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:39.890
 coup I chose a perfume prada who 

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.150
 smells of orange blossom on 

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:43.460
 unfortunately these reduced rates are 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.860
 limited here are the girls I hope that 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:47.479
 you died of a routine I liked you 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.340
 make big kisses and I tell you to 

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:51.710
 very fast and if you are not yet
