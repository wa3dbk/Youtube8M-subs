00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
but that's a pretty interesting spot but

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.670 
but that's a pretty interesting spot but
he<00:01:21.400> ends<00:01:21.550> up<00:01:21.580> getting<00:01:21.700> another<00:01:21.970> kill<00:01:22.240> and<00:01:22.680> ends

kills<00:01:26.080> like<00:01:26.710> that<00:01:26.950> in<00:01:27.280> spawn<00:01:27.610> is<00:01:27.820> pretty

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
kills like that in spawn is pretty

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.580 
kills like that in spawn is pretty
amazing<00:01:28.210> so<00:01:28.600> I<00:01:28.660> thought<00:01:28.780> it<00:01:28.900> was<00:01:28.960> worth<00:01:29.140> the
