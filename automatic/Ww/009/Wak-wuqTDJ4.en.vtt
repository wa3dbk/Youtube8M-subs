00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
which is a lot more than I actually

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.680 
which is a lot more than I actually
thought<00:00:47.100> would<00:00:47.340> be<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.610> case<00:00:47.820> I<00:00:48.059> knew<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.420> a

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
thought would be the case I knew that a

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.510 
thought would be the case I knew that a
lot<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.379> people<00:00:49.469> would<00:00:49.739> want<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.160> nuke<00:00:50.309> but<00:00:50.489> I

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
lot of people would want the nuke but I

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.819 
lot of people would want the nuke but I
didn't<00:00:50.760> think<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:51.030> would<00:00:51.120> be<00:00:51.239> that

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
didn't think it would be that

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.229 
didn't think it would be that
overwhelming<00:00:52.829> but<00:00:53.070> yeah<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.489> this<00:00:53.820> was<00:00:54.059> this

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
overwhelming but yeah that this was this

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.520

people's eyes overpowered a lot of

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.880 
people's eyes overpowered a lot of
people<00:01:29.130> try<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.340> do<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.030> imitate<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.890> but

that from the previous Call of Duty's

for a modern warfare two modern warfare

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.440 
for a modern warfare two modern warfare
3<00:02:06.299> black<00:02:07.049> ops<00:02:07.290> 2<00:02:07.560> there's<00:02:07.770> always<00:02:08.190> been<00:02:08.429> one<00:02:09.209> or

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
3 black ops 2 there's always been one or

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.600 
3 black ops 2 there's always been one or
two<00:02:09.780> over<00:02:10.110> powered<00:02:10.649> weapons<00:02:11.129> and<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.370> don't

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
two over powered weapons and I don't

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.850 
two over powered weapons and I don't
think<00:02:11.790> that's<00:02:11.940> a<00:02:12.180> mistake<00:02:12.300> from<00:02:12.840> call<00:02:13.080> of<00:02:13.110> duty

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
think that's a mistake from call of duty

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.310 
think that's a mistake from call of duty
because<00:02:14.010> I<00:02:14.040> think<00:02:14.340> if<00:02:14.580> everything<00:02:15.450> was<00:02:15.570> really

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
because I think if everything was really

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.530 
because I think if everything was really
balanced<00:02:16.890> like<00:02:17.280> really<00:02:17.640> really<00:02:17.790> balanced<00:02:18.270> it

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
balanced like really really balanced it

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.870 
balanced like really really balanced it
might<00:02:19.080> make<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.530> game<00:02:19.710> bit<00:02:20.070> boring<00:02:20.550> and<00:02:20.700> a<00:02:20.730> bit

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
might make the game bit boring and a bit

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.820 
might make the game bit boring and a bit
stale<00:02:21.270> matey<00:02:21.600> i'm<00:02:21.870> not<00:02:22.140> sure<00:02:22.410> but<00:02:22.440> if<00:02:22.740> you

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
stale matey i'm not sure but if you

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.920 
stale matey i'm not sure but if you
think<00:02:23.040> back<00:02:23.160> to<00:02:23.340> modern<00:02:23.610> warfare<00:02:23.790> 2<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.300> ACR

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
think back to modern warfare 2 the ACR

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.660 
think back to modern warfare 2 the ACR
and<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.200> ump<00:02:25.740> were<00:02:26.160> really<00:02:26.550> really

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
and the ump were really really

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.150 
and the ump were really really
overpowered<00:02:27.450> modern<00:02:28.350> warfare<00:02:28.500> 3<00:02:28.650> it<00:02:28.950> was<00:02:29.040> the

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
overpowered modern warfare 3 it was the

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.150 
overpowered modern warfare 3 it was the
PP<00:02:29.580> 90<00:02:30.300> m<00:02:30.480> 1<00:02:30.780> I<00:02:30.990> think<00:02:31.200> it<00:02:31.290> was<00:02:31.410> called<00:02:31.620> black

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
PP 90 m 1 I think it was called black

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.220 
PP 90 m 1 I think it was called black
ops<00:02:32.400> 2<00:02:32.730> there<00:02:32.970> was<00:02:33.060> quite<00:02:33.240> a<00:02:33.300> few<00:02:33.420> black<00:02:33.960> ops<00:02:34.140> 1

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
ops 2 there was quite a few black ops 1

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.430 
ops 2 there was quite a few black ops 1
there<00:02:34.920> was<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.100> ak-74<00:02:35.880> you<00:02:36.390> so<00:02:36.870> most<00:02:37.200> of<00:02:37.380> the

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
there was the ak-74 you so most of the

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.620 
there was the ak-74 you so most of the
recent<00:02:37.710> call<00:02:38.010> of<00:02:38.100> duty's<00:02:38.430> have<00:02:38.610> had<00:02:38.820> really

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
recent call of duty's have had really

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.990 
recent call of duty's have had really
quite<00:02:40.020> overpowered<00:02:40.650> weapons<00:02:41.160> in<00:02:41.340> them<00:02:41.520> and<00:02:41.850> in

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
quite overpowered weapons in them and in

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.880 
quite overpowered weapons in them and in
most<00:02:42.180> cases<00:02:42.330> they're<00:02:42.870> not<00:02:42.990> all<00:02:43.200> overpowered

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
most cases they're not all overpowered

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.320 
most cases they're not all overpowered
because<00:02:44.310> that<00:02:44.490> would<00:02:44.610> make<00:02:44.760> them<00:02:44.850> all<00:02:44.970> equal

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
because that would make them all equal

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.720 
because that would make them all equal
but<00:02:45.480> just<00:02:45.720> one<00:02:46.020> or<00:02:46.230> two<00:02:46.260> of<00:02:46.650> them<00:02:46.860> which<00:02:47.430> I

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
but just one or two of them which I

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.280 
but just one or two of them which I
don't<00:02:48.330> know<00:02:48.420> whether<00:02:48.510> it's<00:02:48.600> a<00:02:48.780> conscious

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
don't know whether it's a conscious

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.480 
don't know whether it's a conscious
decision<00:02:49.320> they<00:02:49.830> make<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.190> make<00:02:50.310> them

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
decision they make to make them

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.190 
decision they make to make them
overpowered<00:02:51.090> or<00:02:51.360> whether<00:02:51.540> it's<00:02:51.690> just<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.080> way

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
overpowered or whether it's just the way

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.530 
overpowered or whether it's just the way
that<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.470> game<00:02:52.680> plays<00:02:52.950> out<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.489> that<00:02:54.420> they

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
that the game plays out and that they

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.229 
that the game plays out and that they

really not sure but as much as I hate
those<00:03:01.890> weapons<00:03:02.220> for<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.030> fact<00:03:03.300> that<00:03:03.390> they<00:03:03.600> are

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
those weapons for the fact that they are

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.390 
those weapons for the fact that they are
overpowered<00:03:04.410> and<00:03:04.560> you<00:03:04.650> get<00:03:04.770> killed<00:03:05.040> by<00:03:05.220> them

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
overpowered and you get killed by them

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.060 
overpowered and you get killed by them
you<00:03:05.430> I<00:03:05.580> are<00:03:05.910> that<00:03:06.360> gun<00:03:06.510> is<00:03:06.630> opie<00:03:07.140> as<00:03:07.320> hell<00:03:07.590> as

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
you I are that gun is opie as hell as

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.010 
you I are that gun is opie as hell as
much<00:03:08.520> as<00:03:08.640> I<00:03:08.700> hate<00:03:08.940> them<00:03:09.209> I<00:03:09.330> think<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.810> game

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
much as I hate them I think the game

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.500 
much as I hate them I think the game
would<00:03:10.170> be<00:03:10.200> maybe<00:03:11.010> worse<00:03:11.520> without<00:03:11.910> them<00:03:12.420> i

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
would be maybe worse without them i

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.900 
would be maybe worse without them i
really<00:03:12.959> don't<00:03:13.080> know<00:03:13.320> maybe<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.489> game<00:03:14.670> just

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
really don't know maybe the game just

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.699 
really don't know maybe the game just
wouldn't<00:03:15.239> be<00:03:15.360> quite<00:03:15.690> so<00:03:15.750> much<00:03:16.080> fun<00:03:16.440> without

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
wouldn't be quite so much fun without

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.830 
wouldn't be quite so much fun without
those<00:03:17.070> weapons<00:03:17.700> in<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.420> game<00:03:18.450> because

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
those weapons in the game because

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.390 
those weapons in the game because
they're<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.350> ones<00:03:19.500> that<00:03:19.590> are<00:03:19.739> likely<00:03:19.980> to<00:03:20.160> get

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
they're the ones that are likely to get

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.920 
they're the ones that are likely to get
you<00:03:20.549> the<00:03:20.700> higher<00:03:20.970> kill<00:03:21.810> scores<00:03:22.530> in<00:03:22.860> the<00:03:23.040> game

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
you the higher kill scores in the game

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.390 
you the higher kill scores in the game
maybe<00:03:24.930> i'm<00:03:25.170> wrong<00:03:25.200> i<00:03:25.620> could<00:03:25.830> be<00:03:25.950> wrong<00:03:25.980> but

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
maybe i'm wrong i could be wrong but

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.870 
maybe i'm wrong i could be wrong but
maybe<00:03:27.269> they<00:03:27.810> are<00:03:28.290> just<00:03:28.320> the<00:03:29.010> most<00:03:29.160> fun<00:03:29.519> weapons

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
maybe they are just the most fun weapons

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.210 
maybe they are just the most fun weapons
to<00:03:30.030> use<00:03:30.299> and<00:03:30.540> i<00:03:31.140> guess<00:03:31.320> that<00:03:31.500> kind<00:03:31.680> of<00:03:31.739> links<00:03:32.040> in

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
to use and i guess that kind of links in

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.360 
to use and i guess that kind of links in
with<00:03:32.690> at<00:03:33.690> least<00:03:33.930> with<00:03:34.260> modern<00:03:34.590> warfare<00:03:34.769> 2<00:03:35.130> the

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
with at least with modern warfare 2 the

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.580 
with at least with modern warfare 2 the
quick<00:03:36.060> scoping<00:03:36.510> in<00:03:36.630> there<00:03:36.780> with<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:37.019> snipers

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
quick scoping in there with the snipers

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.360 
quick scoping in there with the snipers
because<00:03:38.519> that<00:03:38.850> was<00:03:39.420> it<00:03:40.140> was<00:03:40.320> an<00:03:40.470> art<00:03:40.709> he<00:03:41.070> had<00:03:41.190> to

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
because that was it was an art he had to

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.860 
because that was it was an art he had to
learn<00:03:41.519> how<00:03:41.760> to<00:03:41.820> do<00:03:42.000> is<00:03:42.120> definitely<00:03:42.660> something

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
learn how to do is definitely something

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.810 
learn how to do is definitely something
that<00:03:42.959> you<00:03:43.080> couldn't<00:03:43.470> just<00:03:43.620> pick<00:03:43.890> up<00:03:44.100> and<00:03:44.400> do

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
that you couldn't just pick up and do

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.400 
that you couldn't just pick up and do
straight<00:03:45.150> away<00:03:45.420> like<00:03:45.690> her<00:03:45.930> with<00:03:46.140> all<00:03:46.260> those

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
straight away like her with all those

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.650 
straight away like her with all those
power<00:03:46.769> weapons<00:03:47.190> but<00:03:47.730> it<00:03:47.820> was<00:03:48.000> something<00:03:48.269> which

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
power weapons but it was something which

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.720 
power weapons but it was something which
gone<00:03:48.959> a<00:03:49.170> lot<00:03:49.290> of<00:03:49.410> people's<00:03:49.650> nerves<00:03:49.860> but<00:03:50.489> I<00:03:50.549> can

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
gone a lot of people's nerves but I can

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.690 
gone a lot of people's nerves but I can
see<00:03:50.910> both<00:03:51.120> sides<00:03:51.180> of<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.930> argument<00:03:52.110> because

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
see both sides of the argument because

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.590 
see both sides of the argument because
quickscoping<00:03:53.700> in<00:03:53.820> modern<00:03:54.060> warfare<00:03:54.209> 2<00:03:54.450> is

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
quickscoping in modern warfare 2 is

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.930 
quickscoping in modern warfare 2 is
definitely<00:03:55.320> the<00:03:55.709> easiest<00:03:55.739> game<00:03:56.340> to<00:03:56.549> do<00:03:56.730> it<00:03:56.820> in

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
definitely the easiest game to do it in

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.870 
definitely the easiest game to do it in
my<00:03:57.239> opinion<00:03:57.570> I<00:03:57.750> think<00:03:57.780> anyway<00:03:58.320> I<00:03:59.070> can't<00:03:59.640> do<00:03:59.790> it

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
my opinion I think anyway I can't do it

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.520 
my opinion I think anyway I can't do it
in<00:03:59.940> any<00:04:00.090> of<00:04:00.239> the<00:04:00.330> game<00:04:00.480> with<00:04:00.660> modern<00:04:01.080> warfare<00:04:01.200> 2

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
in any of the game with modern warfare 2

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.800 
in any of the game with modern warfare 2
so<00:04:01.650> that<00:04:01.830> says<00:04:02.130> something<00:04:02.180> we<00:04:03.180> moved<00:04:03.420> on<00:04:03.630> from

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
so that says something we moved on from

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.390 
so that says something we moved on from
modern<00:04:04.170> warfare<00:04:04.350> 2<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:04.799> i<00:04:04.860> think<00:04:05.190> it<00:04:05.340> was

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
modern warfare 2 and i think it was

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.259 
modern warfare 2 and i think it was
black<00:04:05.730> ops<00:04:06.000> 1<00:04:06.150> where<00:04:07.049> it<00:04:07.230> was<00:04:07.350> pretty<00:04:08.269> real

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
black ops 1 where it was pretty real

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.920 
black ops 1 where it was pretty real
like<00:04:09.480> really<00:04:09.959> quite<00:04:10.230> hard<00:04:10.470> to<00:04:10.590> quickscope<00:04:11.100> and

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
like really quite hard to quickscope and

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.270 
like really quite hard to quickscope and
ever<00:04:12.930> since<00:04:13.140> that<00:04:13.290> it's<00:04:13.590> never<00:04:13.769> quite<00:04:14.100> been

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
ever since that it's never quite been

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.009 
ever since that it's never quite been
the<00:04:14.430> same<00:04:14.640> as<00:04:14.820> modern<00:04:15.120> warfare<00:04:15.239> 2<00:04:15.540> so<00:04:15.690> I<00:04:15.720> guess

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
the same as modern warfare 2 so I guess

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.900 
the same as modern warfare 2 so I guess
what<00:04:16.200> we're<00:04:16.350> looking<00:04:16.620> at<00:04:16.739> is<00:04:16.919> quick<00:04:17.549> scoping

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
what we're looking at is quick scoping

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.659 
what we're looking at is quick scoping
from<00:04:18.120> modern<00:04:18.419> warfare<00:04:18.600> 2<00:04:19.070> compared<00:04:20.070> to<00:04:20.310> i

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
from modern warfare 2 compared to i

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.300 
from modern warfare 2 compared to i
guess<00:04:21.150> like<00:04:21.180> black<00:04:21.959> ops<00:04:22.229> 1<00:04:22.410> or<00:04:22.890> whatever<00:04:23.220> it

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
guess like black ops 1 or whatever it

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.310 
guess like black ops 1 or whatever it
was<00:04:23.340> where<00:04:23.610> I<00:04:23.640> was<00:04:23.700> like<00:04:23.970> really<00:04:24.240> really<00:04:24.870> hard

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
was where I was like really really hard

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.050 
was where I was like really really hard
and<00:04:25.590> just<00:04:25.710> like<00:04:25.919> hit<00:04:26.220> and<00:04:26.370> miss<00:04:26.550> whether<00:04:26.820> you

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
and just like hit and miss whether you

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.760 
and just like hit and miss whether you
actually<00:04:27.270> hit<00:04:27.510> someone<00:04:27.750> or<00:04:27.840> not<00:04:28.169> so<00:04:28.440> do<00:04:28.650> you

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
actually hit someone or not so do you

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.470 
actually hit someone or not so do you
want<00:04:28.980> quick<00:04:29.250> scoping<00:04:29.639> in<00:04:29.820> modern<00:04:30.150> war<00:04:30.300> before

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
want quick scoping in modern war before

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.900 
want quick scoping in modern war before
like<00:04:30.870> I<00:04:31.020> said<00:04:31.260> you<00:04:31.590> can't<00:04:31.830> totally<00:04:32.160> take<00:04:32.610> quick

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
like I said you can't totally take quick

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.750 
like I said you can't totally take quick

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
scoping out what do you want it to be as

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.140 
scoping out what do you want it to be as

people in public lobbies on your team

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.650 
people in public lobbies on your team
trying<00:05:11.010> to<00:05:11.070> quickscope<00:05:11.550> and<00:05:11.820> maybe<00:05:12.479> they

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
trying to quickscope and maybe they

trying to quickscope and maybe they
can't<00:05:12.990> quickscope<00:05:13.470> there<00:05:13.620> unlike<00:05:13.830> two<00:05:14.100> kills

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
can't quickscope there unlike two kills

can't quickscope there unlike two kills
the<00:05:14.610> contributed<00:05:15.419> nothing<00:05:15.600> to<00:05:15.930> the<00:05:16.020> team<00:05:16.260> it

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
the contributed nothing to the team it

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.640 
the contributed nothing to the team it
probably<00:05:17.760> can<00:05:18.030> get<00:05:18.270> quite<00:05:18.479> annoying<00:05:18.780> and<00:05:19.290> I

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
probably can get quite annoying and I

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.710 
probably can get quite annoying and I
can<00:05:19.889> see<00:05:20.070> both<00:05:20.250> sides<00:05:20.490> of<00:05:20.639> the<00:05:20.729> story<00:05:21.000> so<00:05:21.570> it's

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
can see both sides of the story so it's

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.879 
can see both sides of the story so it's
definitely<00:05:22.139> I<00:05:22.229> think<00:05:22.290> going<00:05:22.560> to<00:05:22.620> be<00:05:22.710> one<00:05:22.860> of

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:22.889 
definitely I think going to be one of

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:25.219 
definitely I think going to be one of
the<00:05:23.040> tighter<00:05:23.430> contests<00:05:24.300> that<00:05:24.750> we've<00:05:24.960> done

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:25.229 
the tighter contests that we've done

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:27.440 
the tighter contests that we've done
because<00:05:25.650> honestly<00:05:26.400> I<00:05:26.520> don't<00:05:26.700> know<00:05:26.970> whether

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
because honestly I don't know whether

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:28.730 
because honestly I don't know whether
people<00:05:27.720> are<00:05:27.840> going<00:05:27.990> to<00:05:28.080> want<00:05:28.200> it<00:05:28.440> or<00:05:28.560> not
