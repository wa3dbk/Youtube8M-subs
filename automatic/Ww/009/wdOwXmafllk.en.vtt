sport<00:02:23.640> you<00:02:24.030> know<00:02:24.090> that's<00:02:24.569> the<00:02:24.660> first<00:02:24.900> thing

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
sport you know that's the first thing

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.990 
sport you know that's the first thing
and<00:02:25.230> I<00:02:25.319> guess<00:02:25.769> the<00:02:25.920> businesses<00:02:26.400> in<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.640> second

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
and I guess the businesses in a second

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.449 
and I guess the businesses in a second
but<00:02:27.170> you<00:02:28.170> know<00:02:28.290> he's<00:02:28.470> always<00:02:30.799> trying<00:02:31.799> to<00:02:31.980> make

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
but you know he's always trying to make

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.539 
but you know he's always trying to make
the<00:02:32.580> players<00:02:32.819> feel<00:02:33.150> good<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.599> and<00:02:34.370> and<00:02:35.370> he's

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
the players feel good and and and he's

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.780 
the players feel good and and and he's
he's<00:02:36.090> definitely<00:02:36.599> succeeding<00:02:37.110> in<00:02:37.230> that<00:02:37.410> so<00:02:37.790> I

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
he's definitely succeeding in that so I

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.819 
he's definitely succeeding in that so I
think<00:02:39.000> we<00:02:39.360> need<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:39.629> pay<00:02:40.019> more<00:02:40.260> attention<00:02:40.799> to
