00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:14.059
 Here I give my tip this 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:17.670
 This and this card is blue 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:20.250
 okay what these and the right to 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.240
 that and that is blue 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.590
 ok i'll give you a tip this too 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:34.950
 map and this map are use 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:37.469
 since those two then I play the 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.899
 cards look what the five is the 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:44.670
 wrong sex and thus immediately 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:47.940
 thunderbolts were the lonely ones 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.129
 not because the two are in use 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:01:02.609
 That was the 15 but two more tries 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:01:05.330
 great something on this and this card are 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:11.070
 18 gmt 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:12.479
 I make it important and wonderful as 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.200
 Baff as I ask the way by the way 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.630
 do well 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.670
 we play hanna like that's that 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.000
 new hahner game by but course 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.890
 obviously a cooperative card 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.320
 play and cooperate with these 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.439
 card game you see your own cards 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.759
 not you just look at the back 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:35.009
 and the human back so I came 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.439
 just give tips and either drive 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.170
 or pay so the small kind of all 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.030
 cards was then it is purely to 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.759
 now make cards from one to five in 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.560
 five different colors and one 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.509
 Action is about a card out 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.640
 grow and fell in the end it is 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.710
 to make five prime each with the 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.810
 pay 1 to 5 does not make her that way 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.159
 like me then there are thunderstorm tiles 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.710
 that means you can do exactly three times 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.780
 next to it, the game is over 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.210
 and we can only get seven hints 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:10.110
 go and it's 8:30 you 88 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.680
 and these eight notes in color like 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.859
 then kick around and make a reservation 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.840
 cards from then you have the chance new 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:21.280
 point to turn around or if you have one 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.989
 row completes the game 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.519
 a lot of fun but I am 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:30.719
 really bad in there so in memory 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:33.879
 I am generally not so good at playing 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:36.329
 I think for everyone who plays so memory 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:38.500
 likes and at the same time a faible for 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:41.430
 He has cooperative games here 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.950
 really have fun though 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.359
 you have to be mobile or how do you see that? 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.689
 I think it will be really hard if 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:51.069
 you really do not try in the round 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:53.769
 then I would speak for everyone 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.879
 to play and only his action made 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:59.560
 not on the reaction of others 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:00.939
 respects that's like you're playing is 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.010
 I just can not believe it 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:05.049
 if I drop a card now I 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.209
 pull the twitch of my eyes 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.430
 right left next games but of 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.750
 In contrast, again or second 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.239
 very bad decision 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.280
 So it's going to be pretty hard 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.510
 not really nothing to complain about the 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.669
 is a bit the krux on the 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.489
 Thing 

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:23.409
 I think for the beginning you have to 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.970
 also can not because anyway that 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:26.889
 one actually speaks a lot and often 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.439
 expensive things can be betrayed 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:31.209
 should it's still really difficult 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:33.430
 there is still a 5 and every time 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:37.109
 a 5 to take the hand and he says 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:40.870
 now want to throw one off and each one 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:43.019
 He then naturally white critics should 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.299
 I might not throw it off now yes 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:49.000
 but that's ran them all game 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.949
 but who really cares so really 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.359
 quite cheap game and does so much 

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:56.500
 have fun 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:59.290
 Have spent 67 euros and great fun 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.879
 we already have it now 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.489
 played games and then it also has 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:05.259
 with it and after I have the 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.819
 new declared game equal to the 

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:08.530
 hiked next table would be the same 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.329
 again played two rounds then selects 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.639
 because the next round is still a round one 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:15.159
 So that's why it really made the round 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:16.190
 and not only at the fair in 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:17.690
 all mouth but 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.200
 just now here in ours 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.540
 Spielkreis and is very well received by me 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.850
 not thought so we have so synonymous 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.200
 that only about word of mouth how must 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.480
 you look at you look at these times 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.970
 where we stand in his stand in this 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.960
 politics cards plays and i was must 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.450
 I quite frankly say that 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.310
 skeptical that we will do that and 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.920
 I happen disabused 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.990
 and it's really hard 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.210
 how to think alone if I have the 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.740
 map on the way I have to be so 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.210
 Short training where I go the distance 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.860
 because I noticed that and that 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.590
 was blue that was maybe still the 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.330
 blue 2 and then I put the card 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.970
 then suddenly his position at the 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.800
 Of course you have to be pretty right there 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.660
 We could also have one of the biggest 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.850
 explain a lot as well as now I realized 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.820
 thought as for example pisczek the card 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:07.910
 different so really very difficult 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:10.010
 and that's not easy to win 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.260
 There are two more playing conditions 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.880
 either the diseased teacher 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.350
 when the dots are off 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.820
 every card that is at the table really 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.350
 there is a point because you have the 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.840
 season somehow good one in the end 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:23.390
 There were really three winners 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.760
 one has lost game is zero 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.350
 points above what matter now designed 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.350
 and of course that does too 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:32.450
 little bit of charm and tactical came 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.980
 of course the circuit outputs end 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.810
 also say okay problem is just times 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.700
 blind and we still have maybe two 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.870
 kondoch output winner platelet-1 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.580
 maybe you can do it then 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.640
 But that can also be in the pants 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.050
 So do not go for people like me 

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.590
 so i just have i really have 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.630
 fun 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.180
 then I just do not have it 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.350
 you already have the memory 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.350
 bring along skills 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:56.840
 I unfortunately do not put on the day yes 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:59.830
 so much for that but were up to 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.830
 next game 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.040
 a
