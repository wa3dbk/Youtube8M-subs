00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
the fur very slick and slippery so that

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.070 
the fur very slick and slippery so that
it<00:02:38.830> doesn't<00:02:39.190> matter<00:02:39.400> as<00:02:39.670> quickly<00:02:43.080> we're

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
it doesn't matter as quickly we're

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.530 
it doesn't matter as quickly we're
trying<00:02:44.470> a<00:02:44.739> program<00:02:45.220> of<00:02:45.370> trying<00:02:45.670> to<00:02:45.790> get<00:02:45.970> her<00:02:46.090> as

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
trying a program of trying to get her as

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.870 
trying a program of trying to get her as
dry<00:02:46.989> as<00:02:47.170> possible<00:02:47.320> after<00:02:48.220> washing<00:02:48.670> rather

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
dry as possible after washing rather

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.340 
dry as possible after washing rather
than<00:02:49.239> just<00:02:49.420> letting<00:02:49.720> her<00:02:49.810> air<00:02:50.049> dry<00:02:50.320> because

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
than just letting her air dry because

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:58.860 
than just letting her air dry because
that<00:02:50.830> does<00:02:51.070> seem<00:02:51.310> to<00:02:52.769> make<00:02:53.769> the<00:02:54.010> fur<00:02:56.790> less<00:02:57.870> it's

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
that does seem to make the fur less it's

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.870 
that does seem to make the fur less it's
hard<00:02:59.049> to<00:02:59.170> describe<00:02:59.530> but<00:02:59.860> if<00:03:00.280> you<00:03:00.489> just<00:03:00.700> let

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
hard to describe but if you just let

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.449 
hard to describe but if you just let
them<00:03:01.000> air<00:03:01.269> dry<00:03:01.299> and<00:03:01.840> then<00:03:02.560> they<00:03:02.739> don't<00:03:02.920> clean

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
them air dry and then they don't clean

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:11.310 
them air dry and then they don't clean
themselves<00:03:05.160> to<00:03:06.160> help<00:03:09.390> smooth<00:03:10.390> things<00:03:10.420> out<00:03:10.989> it

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
themselves to help smooth things out it

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.699 
themselves to help smooth things out it
does<00:03:11.590> it<00:03:11.950> doesn't<00:03:12.549> seem<00:03:12.700> to<00:03:12.790> last<00:03:13.030> as<00:03:13.209> long

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709
