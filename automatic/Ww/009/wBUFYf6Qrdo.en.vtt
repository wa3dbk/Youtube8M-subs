 modern clans with a clean look and 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.149
 taking as a starting point how well 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.329
 at the beginning of the project is to be able to

 an area she picks up the dining room 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.899
 living room, the entrance hall and a 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.049
 open area 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.119
 was difficult as there sectorizes then this 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.369
 be part of a point of principle which 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.010
 that she's all on an island then area 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.610
 wet hot area and inclusion of the stove 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.040
 as a highlight 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.259
 differential is 3 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.869
 hanging on the bench 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.090
 on the other hand together with the 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.450
 kitchen people already enter the room is 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.180
 gypsum traces were used with the 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.100
 elimination of LED tapes and requires 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.040
 troicki simulating the steps that give 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.729
 access in the lighting but quoted 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.380
 exams and divided these spaces 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.869
 the project 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.820
 in the room where you will receive TV was 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.720
 let hitter that friends own 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.369
 for an environment that has is the use of TV and 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.790
 also as it has a coating of the 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:00.119
 fireplace a stone bacon a presence well 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.299
 imposing would be the focus we have already done 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.070
 punctual use also led points that 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.950
 Make the china in 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.580
 fireplace to be able to show and integrate 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.580
 all this space 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.510
 this illustrious of welcome that we 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.090
 we use in the 'hall' is a piece 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.720
 exclusive of the house brand where it was 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.390
 chosen by his is the lightness as not 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.780
 glass the crystal drops then she 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:31.110
 refers to the sophisticated without having the 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.330
 general would have another more chandelier 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.460
 scoured with crystal was then a piece 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.290
 super punctual that complemented 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.880
 totally the layout you can 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.880
 check the environment 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.680
 the circulation area went very well 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.420
 also studied because it interconnects the 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.240
 area with the social area of ​​the 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.730
 residence then we work is bone 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.880
 of beacons to make the way as 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.490
 circulation without leaving the ceiling without a 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.730
 identity we then use a feature of 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:05.760
 that complements the junction in 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.180
 parallel to the accepted garbage of the couple is 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.180
 had as it is reference as 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.220
 general identity of the environment is a 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.340
 work that we did on drywall and 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.830
 plaster where we used led tapes to the 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.910
 contour made a special design and 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:25.730
 cut with found lines and what 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.350
 complemented all this work 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.900
 that was used was 2 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.470
 trend adriana degreé house is 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.780
 designed for the project 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.720
 In this suite we have also what 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:43.380
 complements is the bathroom that also 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.660
 medical use and give with the coatings 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.540
 the focus was to have the idea of ​​a 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.780
 bath then she has an an entrance 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.780
 where it is not would be lateral with 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.330
 access through the closet where you face 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.030
 with that mirror the bench is very wide 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.640
 not having the idea with the fallen pendants 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.160
 on the sides and the mirror worked as 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.700
 frame result so we got 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:11.220
 cover an effect of a bath room that 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.040
 customer wanted and scored without 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.959
 coatings but then again the 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.560
 lighting scored and scored 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:21.489
 identifying space 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.889
 good we professionals we have is ours 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:27.250
 to have partnerships with 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:30.160
 suppliers to make our dream come true . 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:33.910
 customer leaving the paper exiting the computer 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.169
 then it is presented and several are layouts 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.690
 of projects 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.520
 the oni we have to make happen the 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.130
 I already work at the house brand a few years ago 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:45.580
 and I always meet with them 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.620
 the most correct way is to identify the 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.720
 that the customer expects as well as 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.060
 pendants specially designed in the 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.760
 room that is a non-triggered client that 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.050
 like to fit into the concept is 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.750
 imagined 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.760
 there we find these idea is 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.910
 this suggestion of creating 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:06.100
 leaving the project identity to the face 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.900
 the client is not then we like 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.800
