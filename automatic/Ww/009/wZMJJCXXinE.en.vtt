00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.420
 Hi everyone, I've been here a long time 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.160
 not had a laptop between 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:28.810
 hands so here today it's a 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.840
 qosmio x300 you say to toshiba notebook 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:35.559
 relatively sturdy 17 inches 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.780
 i7 processor then giga ram 2 discs 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:43.620
 1 tera mechanical drives a reader 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:45.580
 burner blu ray and a gtx 770 m 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.530
 then this one I have no right to 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.750
 disassemble like the asus but we will 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.769
 still see a little bit what he has 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.699
 in the stomach 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:56.290
 and then dwell on its aspect 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.290
 finish the competition starts when 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:02.589
 even to treat to its streets of sursee 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:05.049
 price segments between one thousand two hundred 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:08.710
 seventy and 1350 euros we had to asus 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:10.180
 we have obviously msi and we have 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.070
 now gigabyte who arrive with 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.070
 products also very competitive 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.930
 their first contact 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.970
 the laptop is relatively light with 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.500
 his battery 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.530
 there is a hood that seems to be in 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.490
 aluminum but it's a surface that 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:40.020
 still seems to me a little cheap 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.299
 the charger is huge you see the 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:51.869
 transformer 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:54.420
 and then the two feet of notices so 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.310
 the general look we got a hood in 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.679
 Aluminum frame aluminum textures 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.810
 and that prevents fingerprints and 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:04.350
 we use a lot of plastic 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.899
 then bright red is the mark 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.399
 this is what we found especially qosmio 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.269
 the same plastic back these species 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.489
 matte plastic 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:14.010
 it's true that the first contact is 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.500
 not super favorable that it's cheap 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.569
 still a little bit 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.090
 connectivity side we have everything you need 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:25.549
 usb3 the network port you will see from 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:31.070
 the other side there is hdmi and vga 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:31.070
 here we are 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.069
 but on a laptop of this price there good 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:39.659
 it's true that it's the key 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.230
 that's how all codes are 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.209
 the cosmos 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.209
 but frankly I find that a little 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:49.319
 cheap to return the ventilation grid 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:51.180
 and the connection system of the 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:56.760
 transformer who is special too 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:59.250
 toshiba on it ookoodoo only one 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:04.230
 access on the battery obviously 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:08.069
 classic so the battery is a 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.620
 lithium-ion this is a battery that has 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:14.370
 underwent the mobile test brand 2012 a 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.840
 battery which holds between 3h and 3h30 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.480
 it's not bad but it's in the norm 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.669
 today on the equipped laptops 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.250
 new intel processors 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:26.879
 to help nvidia 'mobile' so we have a 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:35.370
 access hatch behind one and 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:37.650
 single access hatch so the first 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.379
 contact these two memory slots 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.359
 available up to 32 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:45.239
 gigas of ram he accepts 32 gigas of ram 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:47.069
 in 1600 so there are two times four 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.370
 original on the motherboard is still 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:52.139
 a hatch to add one has both 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:56.120
 mechanical hard drives that are there so 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:56.120
 it's a potting soil at 5400 rpm 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.829
 see the size of the charger for for 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.769
 the for the for the little info 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:09.629
 technique it's a 19 volts 9 5 years loses 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:13.079
 so that gives you a little order 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:19.139
 of idea what it's all about 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:20.430
 still beefy here is the 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.350
 specific connection the connector 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.889
 specific to toshiba on this this type of 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.889
 skin of products 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.650
 so what we see is good 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:43.330
 screen quality that full hd classic a 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.099
 glossy slab but reacts rather 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.880
 well in their activities it's 8 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:48.130
 milliseconds 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.500
 the sound is not bad at all so we are 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:53.289
 sure of two loudspeakers harman kardon 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.650
 it's good for a 17 inch laptop 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:58.509
 it's not choking it's pretty good 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.729
 it's quiet to use on 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:02.169
 do not hear the wind tunnel on the map 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:04.030
 graphic as we hear about others 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:05.349
 and in terms of performance we are 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.479
 is well we are in the standards of this 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:08.880
 that we find in with an i7 and a 700 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:15.280
 care says m 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:18.159
 it is homogeneous except for 7.7 this point 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.380
 negative on the side we will say that 

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:22.240
 Cyprus side finish is a good 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.380
 product in terms of price ranges it 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.409
 manages to get pretty much everything 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.180
 we want you to see my tests I'm doing 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:30.669
 pass the kajiya test so it is fine 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:33.150
 it and paste them is what we find 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:35.229
 at msi and asus 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.580
 that's the difference it's going to be 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:40.210
 will be fond of aesthetics 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.430
 strong point is the silence 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.880
 of use a screen that is rather 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.080
 not bad 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.940
 and then here are the rest are 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.940
 as well 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.940
 here
