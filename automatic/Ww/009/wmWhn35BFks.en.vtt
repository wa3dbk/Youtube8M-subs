the power brick for some people the way
I<00:00:55.530> fixed<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.190> was<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.610> was<00:00:56.730> very<00:00:56.910> simple<00:00:57.449> I'm

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
I fixed it was it was very simple I'm

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.660 
I fixed it was it was very simple I'm
recording<00:00:58.410> on<00:00:58.530> my<00:00:58.649> iPhone<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.370> there's<00:00:59.550> really

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
recording on my iPhone so there's really

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.810 
recording on my iPhone so there's really
no<00:00:59.879> way<00:01:00.059> for<00:01:00.120> me<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.420> UM<00:01:01.219> hold<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.520> do<00:01:02.640> the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
no way for me to UM hold it and do the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.090 
no way for me to UM hold it and do the
same<00:01:02.850> thing<00:01:03.210> at<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.329> same<00:01:03.539> time<00:01:03.830> but<00:01:04.830> what<00:01:04.979> you

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
same thing at the same time but what you

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.960 
same thing at the same time but what you
want<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.400> do<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:06.619> all<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.710> did<00:01:08.040> was<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.280> looked<00:01:08.790> at

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
want to do is all I did was I looked at

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.850 
want to do is all I did was I looked at
it<00:01:09.090> mine<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.689> insulation<00:01:10.470> was<00:01:10.590> actually

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
it mine the insulation was actually

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.310 
it mine the insulation was actually
coming<00:01:11.070> out<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.760> wiring<00:01:12.360> was<00:01:12.810> exposed

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
coming out and the wiring was exposed

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.370 
coming out and the wiring was exposed
right<00:01:13.619> here<00:01:14.040> all<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:15.000> have<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.299> do<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.750> take

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
right here all you have to do is take

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.170 
right here all you have to do is take
your<00:01:16.590> hand<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:19.310> take<00:01:20.310> your<00:01:20.460> hand<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.880> pinch

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
your hand and take your hand and pinch

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.240 
your hand and take your hand and pinch
the<00:01:21.390> wire<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.290> want<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.590> force<00:01:23.040> the

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
the wire and you want to force the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.109 
the wire and you want to force the
insulation<00:01:23.880> down<00:01:24.090> back<00:01:25.080> into<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.939> back<00:01:26.939> into

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
insulation down back into the back into

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.569 
insulation down back into the back into
there<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.960> doesn't<00:01:28.170> seem<00:01:28.500> like<00:01:28.710> that'll<00:01:29.040> work

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
there it doesn't seem like that'll work

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.069 
there it doesn't seem like that'll work
all<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.090> got<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.270> do<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.659> got<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.810> get<00:01:30.930> the

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
all you got to do is you got to get the

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.980 
all you got to do is you got to get the
other<00:01:31.229> end<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> wire<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.490> just<00:01:33.299> work<00:01:33.600> what

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
other end of the wire and just work what

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.260 
other end of the wire and just work what
happens<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.439> when<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.770> bend<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.579> flex<00:01:35.790> and

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
happens is when you bend and flex and

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.179 
happens is when you bend and flex and
Bend<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:37.229> know<00:01:37.350> move<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.770> wire<00:01:37.950> around

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
Bend and you know move the wire around

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.460 
Bend and you know move the wire around
with<00:01:38.520> wear<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.729> tear<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.240> everyday<00:01:39.450> use<00:01:39.780> and

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
with wear and tear and everyday use and

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.499 
with wear and tear and everyday use and
make<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.829> stretches<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.250> insulation<00:01:42.030> out<00:01:42.210> and

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
make it stretches the insulation out and

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.630 
make it stretches the insulation out and
moves<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.530> back<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.950> forth<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:44.250> what<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.549> need

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
moves it back and forth so what you need

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.039 
moves it back and forth so what you need
to<00:01:44.759> do<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.119> just<00:01:45.180> need<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.659> stretch<00:01:45.899> it

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
to do is you just need to stretch it

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.710 
to do is you just need to stretch it
back<00:01:46.170> out<00:01:46.380> again<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.939> tightens<00:01:48.149> up<00:01:48.479> to

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
back out again and it tightens up to

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.210 
back out again and it tightens up to
from<00:01:48.960> bending<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.619> know<00:01:49.710> when<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:49.920> bend<00:01:50.100> it

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
from bending you know when you bend it

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.819 
from bending you know when you bend it
that<00:01:50.250> way<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.700> pulls<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.049> just<00:01:52.409> keep

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
that way it pulls it so you just keep

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.499 
that way it pulls it so you just keep
working<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.369> wire<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.820> all<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:54.000> did<00:01:54.060> was<00:01:54.360> just

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
working the wire and all I did was just

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.780 
working the wire and all I did was just
stretch<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.810> like<00:01:54.990> this<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:56.310> does<00:01:56.549> hurt

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
stretch it like this and that does hurt

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.670 
stretch it like this and that does hurt
your<00:01:56.969> hands<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.570> used<00:01:57.780> actually<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.439> little

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
your hands so I used actually the little

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.910 
your hands so I used actually the little
