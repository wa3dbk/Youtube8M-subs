ratification<00:00:11.370> this<00:00:12.090> is<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.269> treatment<00:00:12.570> that

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
ratification this is a treatment that

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.570 
ratification this is a treatment that
several<00:00:13.290> species<00:00:13.530> of<00:00:13.799> milkweed<00:00:13.950> require

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
several species of milkweed require

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.210 
several species of milkweed require
before<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.540> seeds<00:00:15.809> will<00:00:15.929> germinate<00:00:16.100> so<00:00:17.100> what

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
before the seeds will germinate so what

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.529 
before the seeds will germinate so what
you<00:00:17.369> want<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.609> do<00:00:17.699> is<00:00:17.850> take<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.090> look<00:00:18.270> at<00:00:18.420> your

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
you want to do is take a look at your

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.689 
you want to do is take a look at your
seed<00:00:18.750> packet<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.470> see<00:00:19.830> if<00:00:19.949> they<00:00:20.100> require<00:00:20.430> the

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
seed packet and see if they require the

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.029 
seed packet and see if they require the
cold<00:00:20.880> moist<00:00:21.210> ratification<00:00:21.930> if<00:00:22.619> that's<00:00:22.859> the

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
cold moist ratification if that's the

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.380 
cold moist ratification if that's the
case<00:00:23.220> you'll<00:00:23.760> want<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.970> gather<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.300> few

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
case you'll want to gather a few

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.859 
case you'll want to gather a few
supplies<00:00:25.160> what<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.189> have<00:00:26.490> here<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:27.269> some<00:00:27.330> sand

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
supplies what I have here is some sand

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.609 
supplies what I have here is some sand
that<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.529> picked<00:00:28.890> up<00:00:29.010> at<00:00:29.160> my<00:00:29.250> local<00:00:29.279> nursery<00:00:29.970> a

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
that I picked up at my local nursery a

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.130 
that I picked up at my local nursery a
quarter<00:00:31.619> cup<00:00:31.830> measurer<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.930> quarter<00:00:33.930> teaspoon

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
quarter cup measurer a quarter teaspoon

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.200 
quarter cup measurer a quarter teaspoon
measure<00:00:35.329> ziplock<00:00:36.329> bag<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:37.050> some<00:00:37.770> tape<00:00:38.120> so<00:00:39.120> the

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
measure ziplock bag and some tape so the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.170 
measure ziplock bag and some tape so the
first<00:00:39.420> step<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.989> fill<00:00:40.170> your<00:00:40.320> ziploc<00:00:40.739> bag

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
first step is to fill your ziploc bag

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.229 
first step is to fill your ziploc bag
with<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.210> quarter<00:00:42.600> cup<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.980> dry<00:00:43.980> sand<00:00:44.090> now<00:00:45.090> it's

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
with a quarter cup of dry sand now it's

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.090 
with a quarter cup of dry sand now it's
really<00:00:45.360> important<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.170> use<00:00:46.320> dry<00:00:46.649> sand

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
really important that you use dry sand

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.979 
really important that you use dry sand
because<00:00:47.969> we<00:00:48.120> want<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.329> make<00:00:48.480> sure<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.870> we

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
because we want to make sure that we

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.690 
because we want to make sure that we
have<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.230> proper<00:00:49.559> proportion<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.160> sand<00:00:50.489> to

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
have the proper proportion of sand to

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.660 
have the proper proportion of sand to
water<00:00:51.500> now<00:00:52.500> once<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.890> have<00:00:52.920> your<00:00:53.160> sand<00:00:53.489> in

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
water now once you have your sand in

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.369 
water now once you have your sand in
here<00:00:53.879> we're<00:00:54.660> going<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.840> take<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.050> quarter

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
here we're going to take a quarter

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.040 
here we're going to take a quarter
teaspoon<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.280> hot<00:00:56.879> water<00:00:59.449> add<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.930> the

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
teaspoon of hot water add that to the

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.319 
teaspoon of hot water add that to the
bag<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:02.010> doesn't<00:01:02.340> seem<00:01:02.520> like<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.730> lot<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.000> water

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
bag it doesn't seem like a lot of water

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.660 
bag it doesn't seem like a lot of water
but<00:01:04.140> it's<00:01:04.260> very<00:01:04.470> important<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.280> sand<00:01:05.519> is

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
but it's very important that the sand is

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.490 
but it's very important that the sand is
just<00:01:05.729> barely<00:01:06.150> moist<00:01:06.689> because<00:01:07.049> if<00:01:07.170> there's<00:01:07.320> too

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
just barely moist because if there's too

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.500 
just barely moist because if there's too
much<00:01:07.530> water<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.640> know<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.970> could<00:01:09.119> possibly

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
much water you know you could possibly

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.980 
much water you know you could possibly
get<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:10.080> mildew<00:01:10.530> or<00:01:10.680> fungus<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.909> now<00:01:12.090> shake

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
get that mildew or fungus so now shake

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:21.580 
get that mildew or fungus so now shake
out<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.320> water<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.799> sand<00:01:14.040> really<00:01:14.250> well

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.770 

once<00:01:22.250> that's<00:01:22.490> mixed<00:01:22.790> now<00:01:23.180> you<00:01:23.240> can<00:01:23.479> add<00:01:23.630> your

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
once that's mixed now you can add your

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:34.330 
once that's mixed now you can add your
seeds<00:01:31.600> once<00:01:32.600> you've<00:01:32.750> added<00:01:32.899> the<00:01:33.079> seeds<00:01:33.350> close

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
seeds once you've added the seeds close

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:42.230 
seeds once you've added the seeds close
up<00:01:34.490> the<00:01:34.610> bag<00:01:34.789> and<00:01:35.710> mix<00:01:36.710> very<00:01:36.829> well

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.780 

and<00:01:42.810> once<00:01:42.990> it's<00:01:43.170> met<00:01:43.380> like<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.280> open<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.610> bag<00:01:44.760> a

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
and once it's met like to open the bag a

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.830 
and once it's met like to open the bag a
little<00:01:45.180> bit<00:01:45.330> to<00:01:45.600> get<00:01:45.780> all<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.960> air<00:01:46.170> out<00:01:46.200> and

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
little bit to get all the air out and

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.200 
little bit to get all the air out and
reseal<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:49.550> now<00:01:50.550> let's<00:01:50.729> make<00:01:50.820> your<00:01:50.940> seed

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
reseal it now let's make your seed

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.180 
reseal it now let's make your seed
packet<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.710> take<00:01:52.950> your<00:01:53.100> tape<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:55.009> tape<00:01:56.009> the

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
packet and take your tape and tape the

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.730 
packet and take your tape and tape the
seed<00:01:56.430> packet<00:01:56.970> label<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.110> bag<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.590> way

seed packet label to the bag that way

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.060 
seed packet label to the bag that way
the<00:01:58.890> seeds<00:01:59.130> are<00:01:59.310> identified<00:01:59.869> now<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.800> purpose

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
the seeds are identified now the purpose

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.800 
the seeds are identified now the purpose
of<00:02:02.159> cold<00:02:02.430> moist<00:02:02.640> stratification<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.690> to

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
of cold moist stratification is to

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.810 
of cold moist stratification is to
replicate<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.440> cold<00:02:04.680> winter<00:02:05.100> with<00:02:05.700> the

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
replicate the cold winter with the

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.430 
replicate the cold winter with the
moisture<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.720> cold<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:07.170> we're<00:02:07.290> going<00:02:07.380> to

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
moisture and the cold so we're going to

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.559 
moisture and the cold so we're going to
place<00:02:07.680> this<00:02:07.890> in<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.100> refrigerator<00:02:08.310> for<00:02:09.119> six

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
place this in the refrigerator for six

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:18.380 
place this in the refrigerator for six
weeks<00:02:09.750> now<00:02:16.340> that<00:02:17.340> we've<00:02:17.580> placed<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:17.970> seeds<00:02:18.180> in

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
weeks now that we've placed the seeds in

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.259 
weeks now that we've placed the seeds in
the<00:02:18.480> refrigerator<00:02:19.080> that's<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:20.310> for<00:02:20.880> six<00:02:21.090> weeks

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
the refrigerator that's it for six weeks

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.350 
the refrigerator that's it for six weeks
then<00:02:21.690> once<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:22.800> pull<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.040> seeds<00:02:23.340> out<00:02:23.550> you<00:02:24.180> can

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
then once you pull the seeds out you can

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.050 
then once you pull the seeds out you can
plant<00:02:24.600> them<00:02:24.750> outdoors<00:02:25.400> or<00:02:26.400> you<00:02:26.700> can<00:02:26.850> follow

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
plant them outdoors or you can follow
