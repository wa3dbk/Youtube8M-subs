00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
my in my personal Sabre work saver is

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.060 
my in my personal Sabre work saver is
upgrade<00:00:41.250> compatible<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.770> crystal<00:00:43.770> shard

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
upgrade compatible to the crystal shard

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.979 
upgrade compatible to the crystal shard
obviously<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.579> don't<00:00:44.670> have<00:00:44.820> access<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:45.930> a

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
obviously I don't have access to that a

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.459 
obviously I don't have access to that a
specialty<00:00:46.739> board<00:00:47.039> but<00:00:47.730> it's<00:00:48.600> user<00:00:48.870> could<00:00:49.170> opt

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
specialty board but it's user could opt

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.880 
specialty board but it's user could opt
to<00:00:49.770> have<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.960> board<00:00:51.960> swapped<00:00:52.260> out<00:00:52.500> for<00:00:52.800> the

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
to have the board swapped out for the

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.100 
to have the board swapped out for the
crystal<00:00:53.309> shard<00:00:53.550> which<00:00:53.760> would<00:00:53.940> give<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.780> a

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
crystal shard which would give it a

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.590 
crystal shard which would give it a
clash<00:00:55.770> Flash<00:00:56.100> capability<00:00:56.760> but<00:00:57.239> for<00:00:57.449> now<00:00:57.570> I

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
clash Flash capability but for now I

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.299 
clash Flash capability but for now I
think<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:58.020> Sabre<00:00:58.230> sort<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.530> stands<00:00:58.859> on<00:00:59.010> its

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
think this Sabre sort of stands on its

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.580 
think this Sabre sort of stands on its
own<00:00:59.460> as<00:00:59.699> as<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.239> great<00:01:00.539> display<00:01:00.870> saver<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.469> it's

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
own as as a great display saver and it's

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.130 
own as as a great display saver and it's
also<00:01:01.770> designed<00:01:02.010> for<00:01:02.850> dueling<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.809> Sabres

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
also designed for dueling the Sabres

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.690 
also designed for dueling the Sabres
essentially<00:01:04.680> based<00:01:05.309> around<00:01:06.110> custom-built

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
essentially based around custom-built

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.520 
essentially based around custom-built
6061<00:01:08.700> aluminum<00:01:09.150> from<00:01:09.720> here<00:01:10.080> all<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.260> way<00:01:10.409> to

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
6061 aluminum from here all the way to

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.200 
6061 aluminum from here all the way to
here<00:01:10.830> everything's<00:01:11.900> an<00:01:12.900> original<00:01:13.409> design<00:01:13.799> and

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
here everything's an original design and

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.170 
here everything's an original design and
I<00:01:15.210> did<00:01:15.420> want<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.720> incorporate<00:01:15.930> however<00:01:16.380> an<00:01:16.500> MHS

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
I did want to incorporate however an MHS

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.219 
I did want to incorporate however an MHS
compatible<00:01:18.180> blade<00:01:18.450> holder<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:18.960> that's<00:01:19.110> what

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
compatible blade holder so that's what

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.210 
compatible blade holder so that's what
this<00:01:19.350> is

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
this is

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.090 
this is
again<00:01:20.640> custom<00:01:21.119> lathe<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.689> my<00:01:22.080> personal<00:01:22.680> design

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
again custom lathe to my personal design

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.510 
again custom lathe to my personal design
but<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.240> does<00:01:24.479> allow<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:25.259> emitter<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.680> be

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
but this does allow the emitter to be

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.060 
but this does allow the emitter to be
unscrewed<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.360> give<00:01:27.960> easy<00:01:28.259> access<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.979> the

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
unscrewed and give easy access to the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.999 
unscrewed and give easy access to the
heatsink<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.850> LED<00:01:30.180> assembly<00:01:30.450> in<00:01:30.750> here

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
heatsink and the LED assembly in here

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.460 
heatsink and the LED assembly in here
as<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.820> can<00:01:32.909> see<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.150> think<00:01:33.270> what<00:01:34.020> stands<00:01:34.290> out

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
as you can see I think what stands out

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.160 
as you can see I think what stands out
immediately<00:01:34.890> on<00:01:35.250> this<00:01:35.400> saber<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:36.420> it's<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:36.960> its

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
immediately on this saber is it's is its

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.850 
immediately on this saber is it's is its
layout<00:01:37.409> it's<00:01:38.070> not<00:01:38.250> your<00:01:38.460> typical<00:01:38.659> tube<00:01:39.860> metal

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
layout it's not your typical tube metal

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.340 
layout it's not your typical tube metal
tube<00:01:41.100> with<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.490> couple<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:42.030> surface<00:01:42.750> details<00:01:43.200> on

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
tube with a couple of surface details on

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.469 
tube with a couple of surface details on
it<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.649> really<00:01:44.220> wanted<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.610> go<00:01:44.759> for<00:01:44.790> depth<00:01:45.180> here

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
it I really wanted to go for depth here

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.020 
it I really wanted to go for depth here
and<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:46.049> I'm<00:01:46.290> sort<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.130> again<00:01:47.399> in<00:01:47.579> an

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
and so I'm sort of again in an

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.230 
and so I'm sort of again in an
exploration<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:50.100> dynamic<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.880> what<00:01:50.939> a

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
exploration of the dynamic of what a

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.200 
exploration of the dynamic of what a
sabre<00:01:51.509> should<00:01:51.840> be<00:01:51.990> in<00:01:52.350> my<00:01:52.590> eyes<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.280> how

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
sabre should be in my eyes and and how

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.780 
sabre should be in my eyes and and how
construction<00:01:54.930> can<00:01:55.170> can<00:01:56.040> vary<00:01:56.310> instead<00:01:56.700> of

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
construction can can vary instead of

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.389 
construction can can vary instead of
just<00:01:56.969> being<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.299> plain<00:01:58.049> tube<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:58.890> this<00:01:59.040> saber<00:01:59.219> is

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
just being a plain tube so this saber is

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.060 
just being a plain tube so this saber is
made<00:01:59.640> up<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.850> multiple<00:02:00.420> components<00:02:01.200> we<00:02:02.040> have

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
made up of multiple components we have

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.940 
made up of multiple components we have
an<00:02:02.430> inner<00:02:02.850> sheath<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.509> an<00:02:03.689> outer<00:02:04.229> sheath<00:02:04.649> the

and then I removed the tape and then did

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.620 
and then I removed the tape and then did
the<00:03:45.170> entire<00:03:45.440> part<00:03:45.920> in<00:03:46.160> acid<00:03:46.760> in<00:03:46.940> a<00:03:47.239> ferric

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.440 
wings and the the Sun sort of in the
center<00:04:45.300> so<00:04:45.630> I<00:04:45.660> try<00:04:45.930> to<00:04:47.090> extrapolate<00:04:48.090> that

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
center so I try to extrapolate that

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.600 
center so I try to extrapolate that
design<00:04:48.810> out<00:04:49.020> here<00:04:49.380> so<00:04:49.560> now<00:04:49.650> you<00:04:49.710> see<00:04:50.100> this

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
design out here so now you see this

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.520 
design out here so now you see this

now<00:04:55.530> we<00:04:55.650> have<00:04:55.800> in<00:04:55.950> the<00:04:56.040> center<00:04:56.250> again<00:04:56.930> more<00:04:57.930> of

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
now we have in the center again more of

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.880 
now we have in the center again more of
that<00:04:58.200> detail<00:04:58.380> and<00:05:00.200> here<00:05:01.200> is<00:05:01.740> a<00:05:02.480> stylized
