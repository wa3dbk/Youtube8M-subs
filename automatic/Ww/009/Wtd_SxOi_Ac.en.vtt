00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.770
 good morning welcome to the portal 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.559
 financial financial today 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.990
 we are with inés temple president of lh 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.599
 dvm peru with her let's talk 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.820
 about the career plan now that comes 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.980
 the 2014 inés thanks for the link the 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.960
 program tell us now that it is coming 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.359
 the end of the year that we must do with 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.880
 our career plan to see I think 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.369
 that you have to look at it as if we were looking at 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.599
 the construction of our house 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.849
 imagine that you have a plot of land and you go to 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.350
 build a house most likely to 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.620
 the local logic what you have to do is 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.059
 first make a plan that is to put in 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.530
 paper and in writing what is it that you 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.840
 you want to do what you need and what is it 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.239
 that you can pay for the idea is to do what 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.000
 same with our career is to say look 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.860
 first long term we want 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.140
 to convert where we want to go 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.100
 who we want to be and based on that 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.859
 ambitious long-term look 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.589
 not limited the idea is very are these 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:04.850
 set goals and objectives for the 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:09.200
 next 10 years 5 years 1 year I'm going to 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:12.170
 do this 2014 and the idea is to do it in 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.509
 positive many many times we start 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.700
 the year with a list of we're going to 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.690
 eat sweets I tried smoking I'm not going to 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.729
 waking up late 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.950
 I will not do this and in the end I will not 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.130
 we meet those objectives because they are 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.049
 immersed according to the reality of today here what 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.640
 What we are looking for is that we look 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:34.009
 Who do we want to be in the long term and 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.050
 that long term we are going to do 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:39.170
 the clear objectives and one thing 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:43.429
 important is that the idea is to dare 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:46.460
 to invent a future many people are 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:48.679
 is a bit limited by not continuing 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.720
 your emptiness or I did these that to me 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:52.580
 the other thing happened for that the two always 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.399
 we say to myself I love this sentence of 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.229
 high that is what he says experience no 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.689
 is what happens to you in life in what 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.539
 you do with what happens to you in life but 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:05.030
 the idea is to look ahead 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:07.189
 dare to aspire to succeed 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.780
 dream good things for us and of 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:10.280
 henceforth make the plan of these 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.640
 goals could be for example study 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.040
 a master's degree or also change 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.019
 I work next year towards partners but 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.690
 if you think in 10 years who I want 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:25.070
 be within that plan suddenly the 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:27.170
 expertise is a fact and change this 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.420
 year of work or suddenly just in 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.040
 three years to fit the plan 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.780
 main you have 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.310
 As I was saying, it's like you want to make yourself 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.750
 a lovely two story house but 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.549
 this year you only have money to 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.220
 one but you leave it prepared 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:42.770
 foundations of the second for the next 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.890
 that long- term look and that look 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.720
 of creating ourselves from 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.760
 invent ourselves in the model as we want 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.530
 see is what makes the difference between 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.900
 people are getting these dreams 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.720
 these grand goals and those that sometimes 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.870
 they stay in nothing 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.570
 and how to be somehow sorted 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:05.530
 to achieve this clear topic we can 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:07.810
 define the goals but as forcing us to 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.870
 to realize them perhaps defining the 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.150
 deadlines deadlines and clear indicators look 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.390
 to me someone taught me this years ago and 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.930
 I all december is grab you 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.510
 excel sheet and every year you add up 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.100
 those goals that you want to have and in the 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.930
 vertical part of the excel sheet and in the 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.420
 horizontal part you put the different 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.730
 months of the year and you are marking each thing 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.330
 that you have to move forward and the challenge is 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.150
 go looking at it every month to see 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.740
 as advanced where you deviate that with 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.590
 sound you have to add that you have to 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.090
 change why that gives you an idea 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.030
 clear of what are the challenges of each 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.910
 month later he will leave every week and from that 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:51.270
 way you order and you drive you drive 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:55.050
 in progress it takes time a little bit but 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.140
 without that plane without that route where are we going to 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.530
 arrive 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:02.050
 and what planes sorry what steps we should 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.920
 continue to do to grow 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.420
 in 2014, they advise us to 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.910
 see several things I think that one has 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.280
 that you can look at yourself and define what your 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.930
 employability profile look what is it 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.930
 that the market in the specialty that 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.950
 one moves is looking for requires what 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.440
 is what people are doing 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.230
 around you is your competition that 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.300
 they will match that they have grown and review 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.790
 the profile from several perspectives one 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.850
 what are the indicators of success that 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.800
 your position requires that you can 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.880
 comment with your boss you can comment 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.440
 with your colleagues 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.260
 what are the achievements that you have to 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.080
 fulfill this year to do for what 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.480
 they pay you second on what do you want that 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.850
 I wanted to learn what seminars courses 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:49.200
 congresses masters you have to do 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:52.990
 this year third what contacts do you want 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.430
 have keep renewing the court that 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.830
 Our contacts are the main 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.580
 sellers of our reputation 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.789
 profile 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:05.409
 and fourth who you want to help whom 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:07.689
 you want to give him a hand because in life 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:12.120
 of the law of reciprocity you receive 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:12.120
 as much as you give and it is very important to know 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.240
 what area of ​​doing good you're going to 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.590
 put this year because that also does not know 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.379
 it improves your profile in a way 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:23.139
 practice but because it does us a lot 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:24.759
 better people and that impacts 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:25.810
 positively our brand and our 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:28.270
 reputation 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.830
 finally inés if next year there 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.180
 people who want to change jobs 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.730
 they have to make and tips 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:37.050
 you recommend to go is to say that way 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.550
 If the idea is to change jobs, you have to 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:42.760
 insert is in the greater plan 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:45.370
 and each job has to bring us closer to 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:49.090
 the big goal to the goal of 10 years to the 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.860
 goal of 20 years and frame it in that and 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:54.640
 if that is what we want if this is the 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:57.250
 next job they go on that path there are 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.590
 to prepare to see what profile they require 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.510
 in that job with the kind of people that 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.190
 are hiring what are the achievements 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.500

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.630
 so that they fit with what they 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:10.060
 need and get in and investigate a 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:12.520
