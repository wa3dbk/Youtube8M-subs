00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.119 
just a few and I should have just moved
them<00:02:40.269> from<00:02:40.450> here<00:02:40.780> to<00:02:40.930> this<00:02:41.110> tank<00:02:41.470> but<00:02:41.830> if<00:02:42.010> you

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129 
them from here to this tank but if you

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:44.759 
them from here to this tank but if you
remember<00:02:42.550> I<00:02:42.580> have<00:02:42.819> them<00:02:42.970> in<00:02:43.030> a<00:02:43.120> box<00:02:43.769> hanging

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
remember I have them in a box hanging

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.410 
remember I have them in a box hanging
here<00:02:45.280> and<00:02:45.489> the<00:02:45.610> reason<00:02:45.730> I<00:02:45.879> had<00:02:46.030> them<00:02:46.120> hanging

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
here and the reason I had them hanging

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.940 
here and the reason I had them hanging
there<00:02:46.629> is<00:02:46.750> because<00:02:47.080> I<00:02:47.110> have<00:02:47.409> the<00:02:47.440> adult

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
there is because I have the adult

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.190 
there is because I have the adult
parents<00:02:48.370> in<00:02:48.489> here<00:02:48.819> and<00:02:49.000> they<00:02:49.959> would<00:02:50.110> have

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
parents in here and they would have

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.660 
parents in here and they would have
eaten<00:02:50.319> them<00:02:50.470> in<00:02:50.560> a<00:02:50.590> heartbeat<00:02:50.860> pretty<00:02:51.459> sure

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
eaten them in a heartbeat pretty sure

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.110
