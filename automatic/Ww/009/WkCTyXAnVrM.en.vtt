00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.000
 just bought back just a little torn say 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:27.239
 If you mix the children in 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:30.690
 to realize it's just bombshell 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.470
 in cheese over the party 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.930
 favored 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.530
 I wish to do that here pic 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.300
 many 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.989
 we are already ready for the gates 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.520
 what do we do we could take 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.440
 any vegetable or if you want 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.920
 take patrick and vegetables we will break 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.660
 so far it's good to know because 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.550
 often used the knife we know 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.350
 not too how best written the 9th 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.180
 naturally when that's what it takes 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.530
 break that moment so we look at the 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.420
 side box that one is a little oil 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.200
 olive to the needs of one but a lot 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.470
 I know what they say is a little salt 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.500
 we still had a lot of salt 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:09.739
 reasoning press to mix like 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:14.010
 that we're going to testify the city she 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:21.890
 squarely on as if it were com leguide 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:21.890
 flatten the color 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.180
 any vegetable you can take 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:30.200
 like putting them squarely on the grill 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.150
 roccoli cheffroy brands to avenge 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.010
 before cauliflower bocaly we can do it 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.390
 also for problem at this moment when 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.980
 I do not do what your unique was worth 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:47.420
 sliced ​​end of the month 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:48.889
 good just a little parmesan and I'm 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.819
 with the heat that were enough for that 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:51.819
 the cheese his quiet wife 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.129
 I can not believe a complete rest center 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:59.859
 price there in everything and everywhere a little less 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:02.720
 of 10 minutes I have the impression 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:05.540
 starchy protein green vegetables well 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.639
 sure it's beautiful it smells good looks still 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.319
 once again taste me I'm going 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:12.489
 test that so the kids come out 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.489
 in it then we go 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.160
