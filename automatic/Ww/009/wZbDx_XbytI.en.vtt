00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:08.760
 all health or from here 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.710
 and well I'm going to invite you to do a 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.840
 very nice job now that we are in 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:18.270
 summer that we have free time that 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:22.560
 we have another mood 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:25.290
 let's do a job a composition 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:30.029
 with mixed media we are going to make a 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:33.510
 vintage picture and for this I brought them in 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:37.770
 this case we have a fibrofácil of 30 x 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.500
 30 where it is already applied in the 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.070
 eco-friendly universal sticker 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.790
 this is about mordant and this 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.370
 suit in this state to be able to apply 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:53.550
 this sheet that is a sheet of paper that 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:58.440
 is used to make the booking of 30 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:01.950
 centimeters like 5 each one this and the 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.920
 I'm going to paste on this this piece of 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:08.430
 fibrofácil to have it as a background to 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.130
 from there we will work with in 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.130
 this case I also did about a 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.580
 fibrofácil a little bit smaller than 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.040
 the base this has 25 by 25 also 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.100
 I did the same apply self-adhesive 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.990
 universal and on this I pasted cloth a 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.020
 common pink fabric 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.930
 to give the fund once this is 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.090
 stuck what I did was give a helping hand 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.360
 paint a little uneven to give a 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:40.049
 vintage style I worked with the color 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:43.470
 shadow skin of horeca the same I did 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.409
 about these pieces that are this holder 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.500
 portraits that are used for souvenir are 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.500
 small in size and have a hand 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.560
 of 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.290
 the demo of the impact that applied to 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.560
 extension once this is dry what 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:04.259
 What I'm going to do is fix a little 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.170
 to remove a little paint and 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.580
 so let them look a little more what 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.670
 What is it 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.480
 the technique with him 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.600
 modeling 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.310
 yes he said 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.640
 to lift the paint a little 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.260
 and give it this vintage style that is 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.560
 what we are looking for the same I'm going 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.080
 do here 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:35.599
 and in this case at work we are going to 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:38.400
 work we're going to use to size 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:41.610
 the dimensional is a product to the water 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:45.239
 that it is applied by dump and once 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:48.780
 that is dry remains with an effect 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:51.680
 crystal that I made here on a 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:55.150
 little piece of gray cardboard and sinks 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.689
 I will apply coupage 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.540
 in the frame and once I apply it what 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:05.849
 what I'm going to do is dump this 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:09.959
 I'm going to do this now by dump I'm going to 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.959
 apply the dimensional 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.250
 the dimensional is a product that has 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:19.100
 the virtue of leaving a crystalline effect 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:22.670
 is applied by dump 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.870
 porch here I can not eat it accommodate 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.930
 a little 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.519
 the shots and I have to leave it in a 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:34.750
 place level and protected as much as possible 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:36.820
 so that we do not get stuck 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.760
 of all the solicitous balls that 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.620
 can be in the environment I leave here and 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.920
 this once it dries is 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.740
 transparent like the model that I brought 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.580
 finished has put here the same I will 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.580
 do in this one 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:58.290
 here he applied it by dump and I'm going to 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:02.040
 then use what is the 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:04.860
 three-dimensional and I take the opportunity to 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.599
 tell them the difference the dimensional 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.480
 which is the product that comes in the 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:12.019
 large container 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.019
 auto at a level 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:20.080
 and I'm going to that video effect on the 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:22.900
 image the three-dimensional not auto level 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:26.470
 That is , I'm going to stay in the same 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:29.050
 condition that was left when applied 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.450
 that is, if I make a point, there will be a 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.030
 I'm going to use the 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.320
 three-dimensional to take advantage of pasting 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:39.729
 tHE PIECES 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:42.789
 that I'm going to use in this composition 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:44.949
 this is a burlap cloth that is a 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:47.289
 Rustic cloth also put it 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:49.510
 three-dimensional I only use a lot of this 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:55.320
 for paste 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:55.320
 here I'm going to paste this which is fabric too 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.720
 and good and then the composition is going 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.760
 Arming of course to everyone's taste 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.720
 they are going to put the accessories that they have 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:09.030
 hand and they will use whatever they want here 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.400
 I'm going to calculate where this is going to be 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.529
 and I'm also going to paste 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:17.420
 and the same thing I will do here 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:20.630
 calculated more or less where is 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:23.890
 and I take the opportunity to fix it and then 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.890
 I will continue to apply 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.830
 accessories 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:32.470
 I had a pretty 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.890
 the decor of course is like 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.890
 each 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:43.380
 at home I have children but not for the 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.380
 pearls 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:49.120
 I had 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:51.220
 some chávez and you're 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:56.850
 with this product you can paste everything 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:56.850
 metal glass cardboard paper 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:05.190
 and this is kind of liked each 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.190
 keep in mind that the product does not 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:10.340
 yellow 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:13.070
 and that you can apply it on photos 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:15.400
 personal and that too I'm going to take 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.400
 a little 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.490
 and you 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.830
 well and this would basically be the 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:31.530
 work finished after what we have 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:34.229
 what to do is apply the framework that I 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:37.139
 I painted it in composé with what would be the 

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:39.780
 center of work and work too 

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:41.240
 he stuck it with three-dimensional work 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:44.240
 finished 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:47.710
 see you next time I leave a hug 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.710
 very big and see you soon 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:51.139
 Y
