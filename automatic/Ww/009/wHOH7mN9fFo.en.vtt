00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.219
 great variety option 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:18.369
 training process and make the game 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:23.320
 moment a little bit is the next 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:26.110
 option is the body rises from the gear 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.790
 ball for this you need a small 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.239
 weighted ball so-called 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.790
 medical naturally mate or 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:36.250
 a partner who will help you and 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.800
 the exercise is performed as follows 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.880
 so you just pass the ball and friend 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:45.460
 friend your partner tries to do it 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.840
 as fast as possible tsm price movement 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.450
 execution must be fast 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.350
 so you do not have time to relax your 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:55.300
 task to catch the ball 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:57.580
 smoothly down or fast but not not 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.730
 jerk and don't beat off the wall 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.690
 oh bench now we go down not to 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.340
 end a 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.770
 and as soon as possible rise and 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.329
 throw the ball back you can throw 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.030
 the ball is not right in hand 

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:12.700
 a little bit to the left to the right slightly 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.159
 up meaning it makes you every 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.439
 just reach for catching the ball and connects everything 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:20.140
 new and new sites and additional 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:23.049
 muscle meaning this exercise is so common 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.420
 general developing it is not intended to 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.109
 local deep impact exactly 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.509
 abdominal muscles 

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:31.780
 but she is great at developing 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:34.090
 muscle coordination and helps also 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.679
 include those muscles that are small muscles 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.679
 which were not previously included in the work 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.900
 Now we will give you a very 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.940
 unconventional and exercise a 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.950
 do not think anything bad really 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.560
 Deal exercise is very interesting it is not 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.840
 standard for these bodybuilders 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.550
 programs but none the less when i start 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.840
 practice on themselves to their customers I 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.720
 felt that she was enough 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:15.050
 efficient and unusual and engages 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.450
 a whole complex of muscles that is pulling up 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.930
 simply pulling the knee-ups on 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.230
 elbows 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.070
 to your shoulders you actually engage a and 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.680
 press and skew masses and intercostal and 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.660
 thigh flexor sole lumbar muscle 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.770
 that is, a whole complex of muscles in 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.430
 static voltage is 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.770
 loin 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.570
 this is not a very accurate study 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.709
 It is the press but in general the whole complex 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:42.520
 torso muscle works hard mode and this 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.630
 very good way to refresh the psyche 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.940
 relax and traditional exercises and 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.920
 try something exotic and the same 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.200
 time efficient ie energy costs 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.390
 during this exercise is big and I 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.980
 I recommend everyone to at least try and 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.090
 it is possible to make it into your arsenal 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.090
 exercises on the Fritz
