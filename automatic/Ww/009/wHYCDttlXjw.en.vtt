00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 I'm disarming the system 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.960
 liquid cooling here and I took out the 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.350
 antifreeze and you remove the pump this 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.350
 it's the bomb 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:16.029
 of antifreeze 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.860
 and as you can see and already remove undo 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:21.020
 hoses and pulled him icer 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:25.890
 they are already can not see are transparent 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:29.000
 and here is this and this is 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.099
 and here is the fucking system so free 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.590
 when I was doing I will release the 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.140
 Mooring rooms and I'm going to unscrew here 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.070
 this to vote this and I'll be the 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.070
 fans worth 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.060
 totally 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.060
 ah 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.640
 and another 22 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.640
 okay 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.579
 this is how it looks like you can see these 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.579
 they are screwed 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.370
 this makes the air rise in another 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:33.780
 largest fan 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:36.330
 drives the air also like this above and 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.990
 went through this and then our 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.990
 productions 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.250
 here is this is the disguise how can 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.189
 see is a common car disguise and 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.710
 current even to wash it as well as 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.500
 it's full of dirt but they do not put 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.610
 water since giving 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.610
 that word know 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:19.950
 and I am very desperate and to be able 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:22.020
 do to be able to use the same day 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.910
 because I put clamps and everything but 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.790
 heart and you can put a spiral of 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.950
 bronze or copper 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.950
 and put silicone and wait for them to stick 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.480
 are here 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.440
 the policies do not catch your attention 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.680
 ah 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.069
 ah 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.819
 water also they seem them my blogs 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:10.079
 and I myself factory 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.079
 between water and salt 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.030
 other possible 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:32.780
 is what I told them this is cool 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.340
 these chips here these chips 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.840
 little ones get hot but 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.819
 this wey are already well-off in such 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.099
 way that they can cool 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:43.360
 correctly out there of all the 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:43.360
 others hardly even warm 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.970
 to 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.810
 and this website and these are the ones that 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.810
 they heat nothing else they are 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:04.160
 this this these pinches trip it 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:07.080
 they warm up very much, look for the 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.060
 way to make it not hot 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.689
 I was thinking in fact to put a little 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.689
 of this thing 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.770
 so to hold some 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.360
 so that it works 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.590
 if it is not with a direct fan it is 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:34.800
 more than enough to cool it 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.800
 there really is not much that is needed 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.020
 ah 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.990
 among 9,500 people 

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:51.789
 ah 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.620
 here 

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:35.210
 but they were slow to turn on because it's going to 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.280
 try to configure that they inhabit 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.129
 locate it 1550 using custom 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.229
 perfect 

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:43.089
 right now he does not have controllers he was going to 

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:45.449
 pull with that resolution as if not 

00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:45.449
 I had nothing 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:03.210
 is that 256 expresses things of life we 

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.210
 let's deny
