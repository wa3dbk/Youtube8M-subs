00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
is it's a block counter but the block

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.760 
is it's a block counter but the block
counter<00:01:27.300> does<00:01:27.510> is<00:01:27.690> it's<00:01:27.900> three<00:01:28.230> blocks<00:01:28.380> of

been noticing earned you a piece of the
stage<00:02:05.810> which<00:02:06.810> is<00:02:06.959> pretty<00:02:07.439> sweet<00:02:07.740> because<00:02:08.099> then

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
stage which is pretty sweet because then

there is called a forbidden cube

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.990 
there is called a forbidden cube
capturing<00:02:46.049> one<00:02:46.170> of<00:02:46.260> these<00:02:46.349> is<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:47.000> serious

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
capturing one of these is a serious

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.930

off<00:02:51.150> a<00:02:51.180> piece<00:02:51.390> of<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.599> stage<00:02:52.579> so<00:02:53.579> pretty<00:02:53.790> much

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
off a piece of the stage so pretty much

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.910 
off a piece of the stage so pretty much
what<00:02:54.090> you<00:02:54.209> do<00:02:54.359> is<00:02:54.569> you<00:02:55.319> hit<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.620> square<00:02:55.799> button

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
what you do is you hit the square button

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.690 
what you do is you hit the square button
and<00:02:57.380> make<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:58.650> speed<00:02:59.069> them<00:02:59.220> up<00:02:59.340> so<00:02:59.489> that<00:02:59.609> they

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
and make and speed them up so that they

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.069 
and make and speed them up so that they
fly<00:02:59.910> off<00:02:59.940> stage<00:03:00.269> i'm<00:03:00.450> pretty<00:03:00.720> sure<00:03:00.900> you

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
fly off stage i'm pretty sure you

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:02.900 
fly off stage i'm pretty sure you
probably<00:03:01.530> wouldn't<00:03:01.920> want<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.310> just<00:03:02.489> sit<00:03:02.730> there

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
probably wouldn't want to just sit there

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.280 
probably wouldn't want to just sit there
while<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.180> queues<00:03:03.420> fly<00:03:03.720> off<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:04.049> stage

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
while the queues fly off the stage

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.250 
while the queues fly off the stage
that's<00:03:05.280> just<00:03:05.489> that'll<00:03:05.880> take<00:03:06.030> way<00:03:06.239> too<00:03:06.269> long

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
after that last cube in that and it's

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.500 
after that last cube in that and it's
going<00:03:12.959> to<00:03:13.019> be<00:03:13.139> a<00:03:13.169> perfect<00:03:14.000> over<00:03:15.000> 5,000<00:03:15.450> CH

to<00:03:43.510> gain<00:03:44.510> extra<00:03:44.810> points<00:03:45.110> as<00:03:45.230> you<00:03:45.260> saw<00:03:45.530> with<00:03:45.709> the

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
to gain extra points as you saw with the

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.229

six hits twelve thousand points thing
now<00:03:50.239> like<00:03:50.390> I<00:03:50.510> said<00:03:50.540> before<00:03:50.780> capturing<00:03:51.260> that

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
now like I said before capturing that

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.050 
now like I said before capturing that
black<00:03:51.860> cube<00:03:52.340> is<00:03:52.519> not<00:03:52.819> a<00:03:53.030> good<00:03:53.239> idea<00:03:54.640> is<00:03:55.640> it<00:03:55.879> will

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
black cube is not a good idea is it will

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.910 
black cube is not a good idea is it will
KL<00:03:56.510> a<00:03:56.540> piece<00:03:56.750> of<00:03:56.780> your<00:03:56.959> stage<00:03:57.230> it's<00:03:57.500> not<00:03:57.680> good

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
KL a piece of your stage it's not good

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.679 
KL a piece of your stage it's not good
the<00:03:58.310> less<00:03:58.489> stage<00:03:58.730> you<00:03:58.849> have<00:03:59.030> the<00:03:59.209> less<00:03:59.390> room

00:03:59.679 --> 00:03:59.689 
the less stage you have the less room

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:00.970 
the less stage you have the less room
you're<00:03:59.840> going<00:03:59.959> to<00:04:00.019> have<00:04:00.140> to<00:04:00.260> just<00:04:00.439> give<00:04:00.829> it

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
you're going to have to just give it

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.030 
you're going to have to just give it
just<00:04:01.459> get<00:04:01.609> out<00:04:01.760> it<00:04:01.879> to<00:04:02.030> just<00:04:02.209> like<00:04:02.709> get<00:04:03.709> rid<00:04:03.890> to

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
just get out it to just like get rid to

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.470 
just get out it to just like get rid to
like<00:04:04.220> just<00:04:04.430> clear<00:04:04.549> the<00:04:04.730> stage<00:04:05.560> now<00:04:06.579> as<00:04:07.579> for<00:04:08.359> my

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
like just clear the stage now as for my

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.690 
like just clear the stage now as for my
rating<00:04:08.870> as<00:04:08.989> a<00:04:09.049> puzzle<00:04:09.709> game<00:04:09.739> I<00:04:10.159> would<00:04:10.459> probably

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
rating as a puzzle game I would probably

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.210 
rating as a puzzle game I would probably
as<00:04:11.329> if<00:04:11.810> I<00:04:12.230> were<00:04:12.349> to<00:04:12.440> grade<00:04:12.590> this<00:04:12.680> is<00:04:12.829> a<00:04:12.859> normal

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
as if I were to grade this is a normal

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.740 
as if I were to grade this is a normal
game<00:04:13.370> I<00:04:13.400> would<00:04:13.579> probably<00:04:13.700> give<00:04:13.940> it<00:04:14.000> a<00:04:14.090> 3<00:04:14.450> out<00:04:14.480> of

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750

progress<00:05:02.740> the<00:05:03.069> stages<00:05:03.430> get<00:05:03.580> more<00:05:03.759> difficult

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
progress the stages get more difficult

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.390 
progress the stages get more difficult
and<00:05:04.479> of<00:05:04.810> course<00:05:05.289> have<00:05:05.440> like<00:05:05.770> any<00:05:05.949> other<00:05:06.190> game

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
the stages see more difficult to hell am

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.830 
the stages see more difficult to hell am
I<00:05:07.750> saying<00:05:08.789> stage<00:05:09.789> 3<00:05:10.120> doesn't<00:05:10.449> really<00:05:10.599> house<00:05:10.810> a

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
I saying stage 3 doesn't really house a

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.589 
I saying stage 3 doesn't really house a
lot<00:05:11.229> more<00:05:11.470> as<00:05:12.099> you<00:05:13.030> can<00:05:13.090> see<00:05:13.210> I<00:05:13.240> capture

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:13.599 
lot more as you can see I capture

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:15.119 
lot more as you can see I capture
forbidden<00:05:14.050> cube<00:05:14.289> their<00:05:14.470> pizza<00:05:14.860> the<00:05:14.949> stage

00:05:15.119 --> 00:05:15.129 
forbidden cube their pizza the stage

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:19.200 
forbidden cube their pizza the stage
fell<00:05:15.370> off<00:05:15.550> so<00:05:15.940> as<00:05:17.009> you<00:05:18.009> progress<00:05:18.340> on<00:05:18.789> and<00:05:19.120> on

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
fell off so as you progress on and on

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.640 
fell off so as you progress on and on
through<00:05:19.240> the<00:05:19.539> stage<00:05:19.750> stuff<00:05:20.169> things<00:05:20.409> stuff

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
through the stage stuff things stuff

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.089 
through the stage stuff things stuff
gets<00:05:20.830> a<00:05:20.949> lot<00:05:21.250> harder<00:05:21.310> as<00:05:21.819> you<00:05:21.849> go<00:05:22.030> along<00:05:22.180> so<00:05:23.099> in

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:24.099 
gets a lot harder as you go along so in

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:26.159 
gets a lot harder as you go along so in
stage<00:05:24.879> 3<00:05:25.090> there's<00:05:25.270> not<00:05:25.419> a<00:05:25.449> lot<00:05:25.629> of<00:05:25.659> difference

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:26.169 
stage 3 there's not a lot of difference

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:27.869 
stage 3 there's not a lot of difference
except<00:05:26.530> that<00:05:26.650> the<00:05:26.710> stage<00:05:26.919> expands<00:05:27.430> by<00:05:27.610> one

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:27.879 
except that the stage expands by one

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:29.850 
except that the stage expands by one
making<00:05:28.210> it<00:05:28.300> up<00:05:28.389> making<00:05:28.870> it<00:05:28.930> a<00:05:29.020> five-part<00:05:29.590> stage

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
making it up making it a five-part stage

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.700 
making it up making it a five-part stage
which<00:05:30.280> is<00:05:30.460> not<00:05:31.449> really<00:05:31.479> that<00:05:31.840> good<00:05:32.139> because

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
which is not really that good because

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.779 
which is not really that good because
five<00:05:33.099> parts<00:05:33.460> is<00:05:33.580> not<00:05:33.909> cool<00:05:34.120> at<00:05:34.389> all<00:05:35.789> but

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:36.789 
five parts is not cool at all but

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:41.879 
five parts is not cool at all but
otherwise<00:05:37.949> you<00:05:38.949> get<00:05:39.069> my<00:05:39.250> point<00:05:39.870> it<00:05:40.870> is<00:05:41.590> Casey<00:05:41.860> I

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:41.889 
otherwise you get my point it is Casey I

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:43.439 
otherwise you get my point it is Casey I
almost<00:05:42.159> accidentally<00:05:42.580> captured<00:05:42.759> a<00:05:43.000> forbidden

cube<00:05:43.659> there<00:05:43.840> which<00:05:44.289> is<00:05:44.409> not<00:05:44.560> good<00:05:44.819> so<00:05:45.819> just<00:05:46.240> let

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
cube there which is not good so just let

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.080 
cube there which is not good so just let
