trying to shoot back at the enemy you
won't<00:01:23.310> flinch<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:23.909> basically<00:01:24.240> your<00:01:24.450> aim<00:01:24.630> will

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
won't flinch so basically your aim will

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.289

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
be pretty precise and you just won't be

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
staying on the outside looking in what I

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.990 
staying on the outside looking in what I
mean<00:02:30.810> is<00:02:31.080> stay<00:02:31.350> by<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.890> barriers<00:02:32.460> of<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.820> map

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
mean is stay by the barriers of the map

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.760 
mean is stay by the barriers of the map
so<00:02:33.300> basically<00:02:33.930> as<00:02:34.080> far<00:02:34.110> as<00:02:34.380> you<00:02:34.500> can<00:02:34.590> possibly

so basically as far as you can possibly

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.310 
so basically as far as you can possibly
go<00:02:35.250> just<00:02:36.150> so<00:02:36.240> the<00:02:36.360> enemy<00:02:36.630> doesn't<00:02:36.810> have<00:02:37.020> you<00:02:37.170> in

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
go just so the enemy doesn't have you in

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.830 
go just so the enemy doesn't have you in
sight<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:37.710> while<00:02:38.700> at<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:38.940> I<00:02:39.180> recommend<00:02:39.720> you
