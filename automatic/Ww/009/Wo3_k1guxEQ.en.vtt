times<00:00:28.050> people<00:00:28.320> have<00:00:28.500> nickel<00:00:28.980> metal<00:00:29.099> hydride

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
times people have nickel metal hydride

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.880 
times people have nickel metal hydride
batteries<00:00:30.029> they<00:00:30.990> charge<00:00:31.289> them<00:00:31.439> they<00:00:31.560> throw<00:00:31.740> in

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
batteries they charge them they throw in

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.139 
batteries they charge them they throw in
the<00:00:31.949> drawer<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.189> then<00:00:32.489> they<00:00:32.579> go<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.790> use<00:00:33.000> them

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
the drawer and then they go to use them

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.780 
the drawer and then they go to use them
again<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.630> they're<00:00:33.930> dead<00:00:34.280> so<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.670> an
