00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.770 
feeling a little better i think that i

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.210

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
which I probably won't need to do I have

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:55.960 
which I probably won't need to do I have

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.130 

and<00:03:04.239> I<00:03:05.049> can<00:03:05.319> always<00:03:05.650> add<00:03:05.890> another<00:03:06.689> md<00:03:07.689> graphics

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
and I can always add another md graphics

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.030 
and I can always add another md graphics
card<00:03:08.379> and<00:03:08.920> do<00:03:09.400> what<00:03:09.549> AMD<00:03:09.819> calls<00:03:10.180> as<00:03:10.540> is<00:03:11.409> known

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
the MLG monitor the asus vs 228 the only

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.170 
the MLG monitor the asus vs 228 the only
difference<00:04:27.320> in<00:04:27.650> the<00:04:28.400> only<00:04:28.580> difference<00:04:29.030> is

person than 23 inch in mine has a 5

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.540 
person than 23 inch in mine has a 5
millisecond<00:04:36.500> response<00:04:36.590> time<00:04:37.010> as<00:04:37.190> opposed<00:04:37.430> to

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
millisecond response time as opposed to

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.850 
millisecond response time as opposed to
a<00:04:37.610> 2<00:04:37.820> millisecond<00:04:38.300> response<00:04:38.360> on<00:04:38.780> so

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
a 2 millisecond response on so

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.679 
a 2 millisecond response on so
three<00:04:40.219> milliseconds<00:04:40.490> slow<00:04:41.120> and<00:04:41.330> response

00:04:41.679 --> 00:04:41.689 
three milliseconds slow and response

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:45.070 
three milliseconds slow and response
time<00:04:42.280> but<00:04:43.280> uh<00:04:43.520> you<00:04:44.150> know<00:04:44.180> that<00:04:44.509> was<00:04:44.780> a<00:04:44.810> thirty

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
time but uh you know that was a thirty

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.170 
time but uh you know that was a thirty
dollars<00:04:45.439> difference<00:04:46.000> I<00:04:48.759> think<00:04:49.759> I'll<00:04:49.909> go<00:04:50.030> with

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
dollars difference I think I'll go with

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.879 
dollars difference I think I'll go with
five<00:04:50.389> here<00:04:50.629> with<00:04:50.810> seconds<00:04:53.530> that<00:04:54.530> doesn't

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
five here with seconds that doesn't

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.969 
five here with seconds that doesn't
really<00:04:55.009> seem<00:04:56.020> let<00:04:57.020> me<00:04:57.080> tell<00:04:57.259> you<00:04:57.319> what<00:04:57.500> if<00:04:57.740> you

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
really seem let me tell you what if you

guys plan on an older HDTV you should

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.089 
guys plan on an older HDTV you should
look<00:05:04.039> into<00:05:04.280> getting<00:05:04.939> a<00:05:05.240> monitor<00:05:05.689> to<00:05:05.719> play<00:05:06.099> you

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:07.099 
look into getting a monitor to play you

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:09.219 
look into getting a monitor to play you
know<00:05:07.219> the<00:05:07.490> Easter<00:05:08.240> monitor<00:05:08.599> that<00:05:08.719> I<00:05:08.750> have<00:05:09.020> has

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:09.229 
know the Easter monitor that I have has

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:16.170 
know the Easter monitor that I have has
an<00:05:09.439> hdmi<00:05:10.069> input<00:05:10.400> so<00:05:10.610> you<00:05:10.669> want<00:05:10.909> any<00:05:11.210> type<00:05:11.479> after

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.450 

the<00:05:17.180> only<00:05:17.389> downside<00:05:17.990> to<00:05:18.229> it<00:05:18.259> the<00:05:18.830> IC<00:05:19.219> is<00:05:19.430> it

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
the only downside to it the IC is it

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.170 
the only downside to it the IC is it
only<00:05:19.789> has<00:05:20.060> one<00:05:20.449> hdmi<00:05:21.139> input<00:05:21.529> now<00:05:22.400> i<00:05:22.669> have<00:05:23.060> an

00:06:57.939 --> 00:06:57.949 
something I just have to really just

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:02.450 
something I just have to really just
kind<00:06:58.129> of<00:06:58.159> knew<00:06:58.339> my<00:06:58.520> eyes

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:02.460 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.119 

okay<00:07:03.599> I've<00:07:04.599> noticed<00:07:04.839> that<00:07:05.080> I<00:07:05.289> can<00:07:05.469> gain<00:07:05.710> for

00:07:06.119 --> 00:07:06.129 
okay I've noticed that I can gain for

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:07.799 
okay I've noticed that I can gain for
longer<00:07:06.399> periods<00:07:06.759> of<00:07:06.819> time<00:07:06.879> because<00:07:07.389> it<00:07:07.629> puts

00:07:07.799 --> 00:07:07.809 
longer periods of time because it puts

00:07:07.809 --> 00:07:10.109 
longer periods of time because it puts
less<00:07:08.020> strain<00:07:08.379> my<00:07:08.649> eyes<00:07:08.680> with<00:07:09.580> the<00:07:09.610> smaller

00:07:10.109 --> 00:07:10.119 
less strain my eyes with the smaller

00:07:10.119 --> 00:07:13.230 
less strain my eyes with the smaller
screen<00:07:11.159> and<00:07:12.159> that<00:07:12.369> could<00:07:12.520> work<00:07:12.669> the<00:07:12.819> opposite

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:13.240 
screen and that could work the opposite

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.939 
screen and that could work the opposite
way<00:07:13.360> to<00:07:13.389> the<00:07:13.719> smaller<00:07:13.990> screen<00:07:14.439> you<00:07:14.649> could<00:07:14.770> have

00:07:14.939 --> 00:07:14.949 
way to the smaller screen you could have

00:07:14.949 --> 00:07:16.649 
way to the smaller screen you could have
to<00:07:15.099> squint<00:07:15.399> or<00:07:15.610> strain<00:07:15.939> a<00:07:15.969> little<00:07:16.240> more<00:07:16.360> to<00:07:16.449> see

00:07:16.649 --> 00:07:16.659 
to squint or strain a little more to see

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:19.619 
to squint or strain a little more to see
it<00:07:16.889> but<00:07:17.889> for<00:07:18.249> me<00:07:18.369> with<00:07:18.789> everything<00:07:19.119> being<00:07:19.479> in

00:07:19.619 --> 00:07:19.629 
it but for me with everything being in

00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:21.409 
it but for me with everything being in
my<00:07:19.719> field<00:07:20.020> of<00:07:20.080> vision<00:07:20.139> right<00:07:20.770> in<00:07:20.949> front<00:07:21.099> of<00:07:21.189> me

00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:21.419 
my field of vision right in front of me

00:07:21.419 --> 00:07:25.129 
my field of vision right in front of me
it<00:07:22.419> puts<00:07:22.809> less<00:07:23.139> strain<00:07:23.469> on<00:07:23.529> my<00:07:23.830> eyes<00:07:23.979> person

00:07:25.129 --> 00:07:25.139 
it puts less strain on my eyes person

00:07:25.139 --> 00:07:28.469 
it puts less strain on my eyes person
you<00:07:26.139> know<00:07:26.729> people<00:07:27.729> in<00:07:27.819> long<00:07:28.029> range<00:07:28.180> gunfights

00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:28.479

I can see them just fine but either way
I<00:07:35.770> think<00:07:36.309> it's<00:07:36.399> a<00:07:36.459> good<00:07:36.580> monitor<00:07:36.969> you<00:07:37.209> guys<00:07:37.389> can

00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:37.599 
I think it's a good monitor you guys can

00:07:37.599 --> 00:07:39.359 
I think it's a good monitor you guys can
step<00:07:37.809> up<00:07:37.959> get<00:07:38.139> the<00:07:38.229> 23<00:07:38.709> inch<00:07:38.889> I<00:07:39.099> believe

00:07:39.359 --> 00:07:39.369 
step up get the 23 inch I believe

00:07:39.369 --> 00:07:41.939
