00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:13.989
 Hi friends 

00:00:13.989 --> 00:00:16.259
 in this class 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:18.060
 I want you to learn 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.669
 how to make your strokes in a notebook professionalism of measures 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:25.789
 so that they have their notes 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.839
 percent in a corner of the world cup at the time of power not 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:30.840
 professional 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.070
 to put to your design measures that will occupy for this layout 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.560
 we would be as is the country matters 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.340
 different span 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.340
 in case the first measure that explodes 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.150
 there is 49 centimeters of size of the back good because here we go to 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.430
 put half that 20n 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.020
 matches the one shown so far 90 let's put 45 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.340
 the accolade missiles are 38 centimeters two we're going to put 19 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.549
 the waist 68 we're going to put 34 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.680
 and we are going to do it in the middle of measures they are going to see how they will be left behind 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.860
 so 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.910
 let's mark 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.890
 in the explosion 20 centimeters and a half we will mark them twice 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.770
 and let's throw our law 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.060
 remember that she 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.170
 the notebook is also a very slippery cloth 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.990
 in which they will not be able to move their pieces 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.250
 and then let's take the measurement 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.290
 beijing 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.020
 to start the case the first case that I told you was the one of the standard 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.390
 and if it is three and a half centimeters what we spend on the neck then here 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.830
 let's lower it our intentions and half 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.300
 and I will mark 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.160
 then they are six and a half centimeters 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.080
 well next to the shoulder 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.080
 we talk about our intentions and means 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.180
 and in a camps 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.500
 lippi we do not 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.839
 our after 

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:13.829
 from now on account that those three centimeters are for the closure 

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:18.309
 because there we are not going to deal with the Syrian red line we are doing 

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:19.479
 we 

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:24.119
 we see that the most holy back in the country where we have 19 centimeters in 

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:27.849
 this tape we talked about in half because the body and it stays in the middle of 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.469
 space 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:32.369
 we mark up we mark down 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:33.809
 and then we will see 

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:37.059
 his shoulder tilt which are three and a half centimeters 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:39.949
 Well, in that direction 

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:44.159
 let's mark half of three and a half centimeters we were going to go down 

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:48.879
 portela became even 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.279
 with the same ribbon acquired with the candle 

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:55.439
 we join our neck line towards them 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:59.140
 now let's see the bust are 45 centimeters 

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:04.349
 remember to push the tape twice to get the fourth 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.619
 and we do not break our heads 

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:11.739
 let's drink 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.859
 fourth of august 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:17.759
 more per node that are two and increased then here we go to 

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:20.299
 let's put a centimeter of 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.419
 of increase plus centimeter and half of stitching 

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:28.149
 we were going to win 

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:30.069
 let's corroborate here 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.779
 because we do not go down to ten centimeters remember that you pay 

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:36.579
 the 20s and in that direction 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:40.379
 is where we are going to lower our bus size 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:42.379
 and there we are going to gather 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:45.379
 our reporter from the cuff 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:50.849
 first goal 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:54.789
 instead of the eight centimeters and we are in the middle of my life these two 

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:56.099
 it will be the four 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:57.799
 centimeter and a half 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:59.969
 of the track because they are three 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:03.419
 instead of raising light 20 we upload it to the theaters 

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:07.319
 instead of separating the light 9 centimeters and a half 

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:12.249
 we separated it in the middle of the tape 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.319
 there we will be more efficient 

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:24.939
 then we are going to take 

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:26.900
 the measure of the waist 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.370
 that we have 43 centimeters waist we double our tape twice 

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:38.629
 and we have quarter of waist 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.249
 more intimate between the middle of the clamp 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:46.249
 more than half a cent of posts 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.759
 we lower our limited bust to the waist 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.710
 of taste the belt 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.059
 we do not have more than other 

00:04:58.059 --> 00:05:02.869
 noriega who is tracing locating m and we will be the complete plot 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.180
 and we do not mark him to wanted half an inch of sewing 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.860
 it may be that ibm 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.740
 when are we going to do 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.230
 a dress that they have brought from the waist so we're going to leave it there 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:18.229
 centimeter and a half 

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:26.600
 we are going to put it here and you this stroke will be in our notes 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:32.439
 we are going to kill here noemÃ­ such a measure but as if they were against their complete 

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:35.809
 here we go down three and a half centimeters 

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:39.889
 for casey centimeters and a half of the neck cut-out 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:42.889
 half back 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:47.400
 half 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.080
 my back 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.080
 we go down three and a half centimeters 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:55.050
 for shoulder tilt 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.300
 we go down here at 11 centimeters and a half 

00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:02.919
 quiles from this line 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:05.729
 ast in that direction 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:07.349
 at eleven thirty 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:09.770
 but then they go from above 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.670
 until here we are going to mark something that is half details 

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:18.619
 half 

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:21.129
 in that direction we are going to give 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:24.129
 fourth of a taste 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:28.710
 + 2 centimeters increase 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.240
 later that post 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.270
 here at eight centimeters in our three centimeter tinsa 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.270
 their separation are nine and a half centimeters 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:43.540
 and here we go up I'm going to remove the pacheco notebook and write 

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:46.360
 its moment 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.110
 ankara 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.110
 details 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.869
 lasarte here write down 

00:06:54.869 --> 00:06:57.869
 4th waist 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.710
 +3 of the stiff 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:04.759
 +13 cost 

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:08.469
 and there is part of the team just starting from above 

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:12.059
 long ago 

00:07:12.059 --> 00:07:15.059
 that detail 

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.660
 Remember, you have to take it twice so that we can be free 

00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:23.399
 kylie we have already our first pointed 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.020
 ramirez this second practice 

00:07:27.619 --> 00:07:31.769
 because if you him not only one class 

00:07:32.309 --> 00:07:36.430
 they ran out of tracing assen to practice analysts four days no longer 

00:07:36.429 --> 00:07:41.319
 know nothing then practice give it many times in one measures in others and 

00:07:41.319 --> 00:07:43.759
 in others in practice 

00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:47.460
 Here is a measurement technique so you can have your notebook 

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:48.770
 with all your notes
