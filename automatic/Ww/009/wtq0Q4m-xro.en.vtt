00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
problem whatsoever heavy duty so let me

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.630 
problem whatsoever heavy duty so let me
show<00:01:55.650> you<00:01:55.710> I'm<00:01:55.890> not<00:01:56.010> going<00:01:56.190> to<00:01:56.250> mount<00:01:56.430> this<00:01:56.580> to

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
show you I'm not going to mount this to

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.160 
show you I'm not going to mount this to
the<00:01:56.820> wall<00:01:56.909> but<00:01:57.240> let<00:01:57.420> me<00:01:57.510> kind<00:01:57.720> of<00:01:57.840> give<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.110> the

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
the wall but let me kind of give you the

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.289 
the wall but let me kind of give you the
idea<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.650> how<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.010> is<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.850> can<00:02:00.000> see<00:02:00.150> the

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
idea of how it is and you can see the

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.660 
idea of how it is and you can see the
pictures<00:02:00.659> on<00:02:00.810> our<00:02:00.869> website<00:02:01.280> let's<00:02:02.280> say<00:02:02.490> that

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
pictures on our website let's say that

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.800 
pictures on our website let's say that
was<00:02:02.880> mounted<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.479> wall<00:02:05.420> you<00:02:06.420> have<00:02:06.450> your

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
was mounted to the wall you have your

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.460 
was mounted to the wall you have your
trunk<00:02:07.729> would<00:02:08.729> be<00:02:08.909> here<00:02:09.209> so<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:09.569> is<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.780> stop

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
trunk would be here so this is a stop

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.920 
trunk would be here so this is a stop
cross<00:02:10.799> country<00:02:11.039> trunk<00:02:11.489> mount<00:02:11.700> so<00:02:12.390> all<00:02:12.569> it<00:02:12.750> does

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
cross country trunk mount so all it does

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.869 
cross country trunk mount so all it does
is<00:02:13.200> it<00:02:13.349> just<00:02:13.530> kind<00:02:13.680> of<00:02:13.830> snaps<00:02:14.159> on<00:02:14.400> like<00:02:14.640> that

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
is it just kind of snaps on like that

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.949 
is it just kind of snaps on like that
you<00:02:15.810> push<00:02:16.049> that<00:02:16.260> on<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:17.310> push<00:02:17.550> this<00:02:17.730> down<00:02:18.000> you

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
you push that on and push this down you

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.839 
you push that on and push this down you
flip<00:02:19.470> your<00:02:19.680> Walker<00:02:20.190> arm

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
flip your Walker arm

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.420 
flip your Walker arm
and<00:02:22.849> that's<00:02:23.480> all<00:02:23.690> there<00:02:23.810> is<00:02:23.959> to<00:02:24.170> it<00:02:24.319> it<00:02:24.530> puts<00:02:25.280> it

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
and that's all there is to it it puts it

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.420 
and that's all there is to it it puts it
nice<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:25.640> secure<00:02:26.470> very<00:02:27.470> solid<00:02:28.010> on<00:02:28.129> the<00:02:28.250> wall

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
nice and secure very solid on the wall

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.820 
nice and secure very solid on the wall
so<00:02:29.120> you<00:02:29.180> would<00:02:29.420> just<00:02:29.450> slide<00:02:29.720> both<00:02:30.260> brackets

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
so you would just slide both brackets

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.089 
so you would just slide both brackets
down<00:02:31.010> and<00:02:31.810> that<00:02:32.810> would<00:02:33.050> be<00:02:33.200> all<00:02:33.530> there<00:02:33.800> is<00:02:33.920> to

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
down and that would be all there is to

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.130 
down and that would be all there is to
it<00:02:34.280> if<00:02:34.400> you<00:02:34.550> want<00:02:34.730> it<00:02:34.819> off<00:02:35.000> just<00:02:35.750> pick<00:02:35.989> your

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
it if you want it off just pick your

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.540 
it if you want it off just pick your
flipper<00:02:36.800> your<00:02:37.670> catcher<00:02:38.440> lift<00:02:39.440> it<00:02:39.650> off<00:02:39.800> and

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
flipper your catcher lift it off and

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.180 
flipper your catcher lift it off and
slide<00:02:40.819> your<00:02:40.880> trunk<00:02:41.300> off<00:02:41.480> so<00:02:42.290> it's<00:02:42.709> that<00:02:42.950> easy

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
slide your trunk off so it's that easy

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.190 
slide your trunk off so it's that easy
but<00:02:43.580> again<00:02:43.819> it<00:02:44.090> just<00:02:44.120> kind<00:02:44.540> of<00:02:44.599> snaps<00:02:44.900> right

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
but again it just kind of snaps right

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.050 
but again it just kind of snaps right
down<00:02:45.410> on<00:02:45.620> nothing<00:02:46.069> fancy<00:02:46.489> no<00:02:46.640> moving<00:02:46.910> parts

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
down on nothing fancy no moving parts

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.600 
down on nothing fancy no moving parts
you're<00:02:47.900> gonna<00:02:48.019> snap<00:02:48.290> that<00:02:48.590> one<00:02:48.769> in<00:02:48.920> slide<00:02:49.459> your

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
you're gonna snap that one in slide your

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.410 
you're gonna snap that one in slide your
trunk<00:02:49.880> down<00:02:50.090> on<00:02:50.299> it<00:02:50.860> it<00:02:51.860> snaps<00:02:52.220> on<00:02:52.489> flip<00:02:53.209> your

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
trunk down on it it snaps on flip your

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.650 
trunk down on it it snaps on flip your
catch<00:02:54.319> down<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:54.920> there<00:02:55.519> you<00:02:55.549> go<00:02:55.819> that's<00:02:56.360> how

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
catch down and there you go that's how

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.020 
catch down and there you go that's how
it<00:02:56.840> would<00:02:56.959> mount<00:02:57.170> so<00:02:57.890> again<00:02:58.190> very<00:02:58.489> easy<00:02:58.730> the

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
it would mount so again very easy the

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.520 
it would mount so again very easy the
hardest<00:02:59.360> part<00:02:59.569> is<00:02:59.660> just<00:02:59.840> mounting<00:03:00.170> it<00:03:00.260> to<00:03:00.290> your

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
hardest part is just mounting it to your

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.890 
hardest part is just mounting it to your
wall<00:03:00.940> figuring<00:03:01.940> out<00:03:02.030> where<00:03:02.209> your<00:03:02.360> studs<00:03:02.660> are

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
wall figuring out where your studs are

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.360 
wall figuring out where your studs are
if<00:03:03.019> you<00:03:03.110> have<00:03:03.200> drywall<00:03:03.500> and<00:03:03.829> you<00:03:03.890> can't<00:03:04.099> see<00:03:04.340> it

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
if you have drywall and you can't see it

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.100

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
where they're at you maybe need to get a

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.280 
where they're at you maybe need to get a
stud<00:03:06.349> finder<00:03:06.910> if<00:03:07.910> you<00:03:08.480> see<00:03:08.690> your<00:03:08.840> studs<00:03:09.110> you

stud finder if you see your studs you

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.140 
stud finder if you see your studs you
can't<00:03:09.500> get<00:03:09.650> much<00:03:09.829> easier<00:03:09.860> than<00:03:10.340> that<00:03:10.400> bolt<00:03:11.000> it

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
can't get much easier than that bolt it

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.130 
can't get much easier than that bolt it
up<00:03:11.239> and<00:03:12.940> ready<00:03:13.940> to<00:03:14.060> put<00:03:14.209> your<00:03:14.360> trunk<00:03:14.569> on<00:03:14.750> so
