00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.149 

the<00:00:00.630> chemical<00:00:01.199> equation<00:00:01.740> for<00:00:01.770> the<00:00:02.070> reaction

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
the chemical equation for the reaction

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.530 
the chemical equation for the reaction
is<00:00:03.770> sodium<00:00:04.770> combining<00:00:05.759> with<00:00:05.910> oxygen<00:00:05.940> to<00:00:06.390> form

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
is sodium combining with oxygen to form

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.919 
is sodium combining with oxygen to form
sodium<00:00:07.350> oxide<00:00:07.830> and<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:09.090> formula<00:00:09.450> for<00:00:09.599> sodium

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
sodium oxide and the formula for sodium

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.360 
sodium oxide and the formula for sodium
oxide<00:00:10.080> just<00:00:10.500> like<00:00:10.590> with<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.800> lithium<00:00:10.950> oxide

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
oxide just like with the lithium oxide

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.049 
oxide just like with the lithium oxide
is<00:00:11.900> na2o<00:00:12.900> so<00:00:13.799> two<00:00:14.370> sodium's

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
is na2o so two sodium's

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.080 
is na2o so two sodium's
and<00:00:15.210> one<00:00:15.420> oxygen<00:00:16.070> but<00:00:17.070> if<00:00:17.160> we<00:00:17.369> burn<00:00:17.580> sodium

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
and one oxygen but if we burn sodium

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.000 
and one oxygen but if we burn sodium
with<00:00:18.300> lots<00:00:18.630> of<00:00:18.840> oxygen<00:00:18.990> we<00:00:19.500> can<00:00:19.650> actually<00:00:19.770> get

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
with lots of oxygen we can actually get

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.310 
with lots of oxygen we can actually get
a<00:00:20.070> different<00:00:20.520> compound<00:00:21.000> formed<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:21.750> this<00:00:22.170> is

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
a different compound formed and this is

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.250 
a different compound formed and this is
called<00:00:22.560> sodium<00:00:23.160> peroxide<00:00:23.609> so<00:00:24.570> this<00:00:24.720> has<00:00:24.930> much

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
called sodium peroxide so this has much

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.040 
called sodium peroxide so this has much
more<00:00:25.500> oxygen<00:00:26.010> built<00:00:26.279> into<00:00:26.580> its<00:00:26.699> structure<00:00:27.050> so

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
more oxygen built into its structure so

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.250 
more oxygen built into its structure so
normal<00:00:28.529> sodium<00:00:28.980> oxide<00:00:29.099> had<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.670> formula<00:00:30.140> na2o

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
normal sodium oxide had the formula na2o

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.830 
normal sodium oxide had the formula na2o
sodium<00:00:32.250> peroxide<00:00:32.610> has<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.719> formula<00:00:34.110> na<00:00:34.469> 2<00:00:34.530> o<00:00:35.010> 2

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
sodium peroxide has the formula na 2 o 2

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.900 
sodium peroxide has the formula na 2 o 2
so<00:00:36.840> this<00:00:37.079> is<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.380> structure<00:00:37.680> for<00:00:38.280> sodium

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
so this is the structure for sodium

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.180 
so this is the structure for sodium
oxide<00:00:39.090> each<00:00:39.660> sodium<00:00:40.290> has<00:00:40.440> lost<00:00:40.710> its<00:00:40.950> electron

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
oxide each sodium has lost its electron

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.549 
oxide each sodium has lost its electron
to<00:00:41.520> give<00:00:41.700> us<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.910> NA<00:00:42.149> plus<00:00:42.420> iron<00:00:42.690> this<00:00:43.410> is

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
to give us the NA plus iron this is

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.470 
to give us the NA plus iron this is
counter<00:00:43.920> balanced<00:00:44.219> now<00:00:44.399> by<00:00:44.579> one<00:00:44.850> oxygen<00:00:45.300> in

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
counter balanced now by one oxygen in

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.779 
counter balanced now by one oxygen in
sodium<00:00:45.930> oxide<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.469> we<00:00:46.559> have<00:00:46.649> an<00:00:46.739> O<00:00:46.950> with<00:00:47.219> double

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
sodium oxide so we have an O with double

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.560 
sodium oxide so we have an O with double
negative<00:00:48.210> charge<00:00:48.570> but<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:49.590> sodium<00:00:50.070> peroxide

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
negative charge but in sodium peroxide

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.770 
negative charge but in sodium peroxide
we<00:00:51.570> have<00:00:51.780> two<00:00:52.020> oxygens<00:00:52.530> still<00:00:52.800> join<00:00:53.129> together

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
we have two oxygens still join together

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.880 
we have two oxygens still join together
overall<00:00:54.780> they<00:00:54.989> have<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.410> double<00:00:55.649> negative

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
overall they have a double negative

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.619 
overall they have a double negative
charge<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:56.550> if<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:56.850> like<00:00:57.030> one<00:00:57.329> negative

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
charge so if you like one negative

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.779 
charge so if you like one negative
charge<00:00:57.809> each<00:00:58.289> but<00:00:58.920> now<00:00:59.070> we<00:00:59.129> have<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.609> two

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
charge each but now we have the two

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.500 
charge each but now we have the two
sodium's<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.600> two<00:01:01.199> oxygens<00:01:01.980> in<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.640> peroxide

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
sodium's and two oxygens in the peroxide

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.550 
sodium's and two oxygens in the peroxide
unit<00:01:04.129> okay<00:01:05.630> well<00:01:06.630> what<00:01:07.049> can<00:01:07.080> we<00:01:07.229> do<00:01:07.409> with

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
unit okay well what can we do with

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.649 
unit okay well what can we do with
sodium<00:01:07.979> peroxide<00:01:08.189> well<00:01:08.790> with<00:01:08.939> all<00:01:09.180> this<00:01:09.390> extra

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
sodium peroxide well with all this extra

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.870 
sodium peroxide well with all this extra
oxygen<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.979> turns<00:01:11.040> out<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.610> be<00:01:11.640> rather

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
oxygen it turns out to be rather

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.149 
oxygen it turns out to be rather
reactive<00:01:12.510> we<00:01:12.630> can<00:01:12.780> release<00:01:13.170> some<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:14.010> this

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
reactive we can release some of this

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.670 
reactive we can release some of this
oxygen<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.909> we<00:01:15.450> can<00:01:15.600> get<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.990> combine<00:01:16.170> with

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
oxygen and we can get it to combine with

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.140 
oxygen and we can get it to combine with
things<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.159> what<00:01:17.400> can<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.580> get<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:17.970> combine

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
things so what can I get it to combine

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.539 
things so what can I get it to combine
with<00:01:19.250> how<00:01:20.250> about<00:01:20.549> some<00:01:21.150> rice<00:01:21.330> krispies<00:01:22.460> and<00:01:23.460> of

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
with how about some rice krispies and of

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.850 
with how about some rice krispies and of
course<00:01:23.790> we<00:01:24.030> get<00:01:24.270> our<00:01:24.479> energy<00:01:24.900> by<00:01:25.799> the

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
course we get our energy by the

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.999 
course we get our energy by the
combination<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:27.000> oxygen<00:01:27.450> with<00:01:28.140> our<00:01:28.320> food<00:01:28.590> such

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
combination of oxygen with our food such

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.039 
combination of oxygen with our food such
as<00:01:29.130> our<00:01:29.250> rice<00:01:29.460> krispies<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.689> we're<00:01:30.840> going<00:01:30.960> to

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
as our rice krispies so we're going to

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.160 
as our rice krispies so we're going to
show<00:01:31.290> exactly<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.130> same<00:01:32.369> reaction<00:01:32.970> now<00:01:33.170> so

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
show exactly that same reaction now so

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.050 
show exactly that same reaction now so
this<00:01:34.439> is<00:01:34.619> our<00:01:35.040> food<00:01:35.640> rice<00:01:36.119> crispies<00:01:36.659> add<00:01:38.060> some

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
this is our food rice crispies add some

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.450 
this is our food rice crispies add some
oxygen<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.170> oxygen<00:01:40.200> here<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.369> the

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
oxygen and the oxygen here is in the

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.539 
oxygen and the oxygen here is in the
form<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.939> sodium<00:01:42.270> peroxide<00:01:43.100> so<00:01:44.100> this<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.520> a

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
form of sodium peroxide so this is a

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.569 
form of sodium peroxide so this is a
nice<00:01:45.329> yellow<00:01:45.689> powder<00:01:46.250> so<00:01:47.250> I'm<00:01:47.310> going<00:01:47.490> to

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
nice yellow powder so I'm going to

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.039 
nice yellow powder so I'm going to
sprinkle<00:01:47.880> this<00:01:48.090> on<00:01:48.210> just<00:01:48.509> like<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.960> would

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
sprinkle this on just like I would

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.740 
sprinkle this on just like I would
sprinkle<00:01:49.350> my<00:01:49.530> sugar<00:01:49.860> on<00:01:50.240> maybe<00:01:51.240> that's<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.509> bit

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
sprinkle my sugar on maybe that's a bit

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.710 
sprinkle my sugar on maybe that's a bit
too<00:01:51.869> much<00:01:51.990> sugar<00:01:52.759> okay<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.030> then<00:01:54.240> well<00:01:54.570> you'd

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
too much sugar okay and then well you'd

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.480 
too much sugar okay and then well you'd
add<00:01:54.869> your<00:01:55.049> milk<00:01:55.290> well<00:01:55.920> I'm<00:01:56.040> not<00:01:56.130> going<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.399> add

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
add your milk well I'm not going to add

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.370 
add your milk well I'm not going to add
milk<00:01:56.759> I'm<00:01:56.939> going<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.149> add<00:01:57.299> some<00:01:57.719> water<00:01:57.930> and

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
milk I'm going to add some water and

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.679 
milk I'm going to add some water and
perhaps<00:01:58.799> if<00:01:59.070> we<00:01:59.159> have<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.460> lights<00:01:59.640> down<00:01:59.969> now

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
perhaps if we have the lights down now

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.990 
perhaps if we have the lights down now
added<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.229> water<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.829> water<00:02:02.040> allows<00:02:02.640> the

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
added the water the water allows the

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.459 
added the water the water allows the
peroxide<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.600> come<00:02:03.689> into<00:02:03.810> contact<00:02:04.049> with<00:02:04.380> the

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
peroxide to come into contact with the

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.100 
peroxide to come into contact with the
rice<00:02:04.950> crispies<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.640> look<00:02:06.360> at<00:02:06.509> all<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.750> energy

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
rice crispies and look at all the energy

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.680 
rice crispies and look at all the energy
that's<00:02:07.259> released<00:02:07.970> so<00:02:08.970> there's<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.300> lot<00:02:09.539> of

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
that's released so there's a lot of

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.540 
that's released so there's a lot of
energy<00:02:10.020> now<00:02:10.170> that's<00:02:10.470> released<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.099> this<00:02:11.340> is

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
energy now that's released and this is

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.280 
energy now that's released and this is
as<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:12.000> rice<00:02:12.209> krispies

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
as the rice krispies

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.940 
as the rice krispies
burn<00:02:13.439> with<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.969> oxygen<00:02:15.360> supplied<00:02:15.989> from<00:02:16.680> the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
burn with the oxygen supplied from the

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.720 
burn with the oxygen supplied from the
sodium<00:02:17.459> peroxide<00:02:18.349> so<00:02:19.349> the<00:02:19.469> peroxide<00:02:20.069> had<00:02:20.370> lots

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
sodium peroxide so the peroxide had lots

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.149 
sodium peroxide so the peroxide had lots
of<00:02:20.909> oxygen<00:02:21.060> available<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:22.079> it<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.439> react<00:02:23.000> okay

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:25.159 
of oxygen available to it to react okay

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:29.540 
of oxygen available to it to react okay
so<00:02:26.159> that's<00:02:26.730> sodium
