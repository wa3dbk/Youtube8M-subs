tilt up this is a little bit shaky but
if<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.140> do<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.289> claymation<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:56.340> won't<00:00:56.550> really

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
if you do a claymation it won't really

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.520 
if you do a claymation it won't really
matter<00:00:56.789> because<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.570> just<00:00:57.719> let<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.050> stable

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
matter because you just let it stable

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.460 
matter because you just let it stable

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
again one let's look at the tripod fold

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.050 
again one let's look at the tripod fold
it<00:02:07.290> all<00:02:07.440> the<00:02:07.470> way<00:02:07.620> out<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:08.130> then<00:02:08.430> to<00:02:08.670> fold<00:02:08.940> it

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
it all the way out and then to fold it

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.290 
it all the way out and then to fold it
back<00:02:09.210> up<00:02:09.480> in<00:02:09.860> just<00:02:10.860> push<00:02:11.130> it<00:02:11.310> back<00:02:11.340> up<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:12.060> it

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
back up in just push it back up and it

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.970 
back up in just push it back up and it
collapses<00:02:13.910> like<00:02:14.910> that<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:16.170> this<00:02:16.530> is<00:02:16.710> just<00:02:16.890> a

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
collapses like that and this is just a

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.160 
collapses like that and this is just a
little<00:02:17.100> weight<00:02:17.370> on<00:02:17.400> there<00:02:17.820> for<00:02:18.450> trains<00:02:18.750> in<00:02:19.020> on

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
little weight on there for trains in on

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.160 
little weight on there for trains in on
boats<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:20.100> stuff<00:02:20.280> just<00:02:20.520> to<00:02:20.670> keep<00:02:20.880> it<00:02:21.170> steady

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
boats and stuff just to keep it steady

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.970 
boats and stuff just to keep it steady
because<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:23.010> phone<00:02:23.250> is<00:02:23.640> very<00:02:24.090> heavy<00:02:24.980> will

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
because the phone is very heavy will

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.980 
because the phone is very heavy will
compare<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.550> Lego<00:02:26.850> and<00:02:27.060> there's<00:02:27.480> just<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:27.870> lot

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
compare the Lego and there's just a lot

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.540 
compare the Lego and there's just a lot
of<00:02:28.050> mechanism<00:02:28.740> for<00:02:29.190> you

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
of mechanism for you

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.320 
of mechanism for you
now<00:02:30.450> it<00:02:30.600> tilts<00:02:30.990> is<00:02:31.740> that<00:02:31.950> things<00:02:32.160> clear<00:02:32.550> got<00:02:33.300> a

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
now it tilts is that things clear got a

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.390 
now it tilts is that things clear got a
bunch<00:02:33.570> of<00:02:33.720> those<00:02:33.900> so<00:02:34.260> yep<00:02:35.070> that's<00:02:35.130> just<00:02:35.940> it<00:02:36.210> and

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
bunch of those so yep that's just it and

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.400 
bunch of those so yep that's just it and
by
