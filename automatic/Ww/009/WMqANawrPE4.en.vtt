mesh<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.719> have<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.260> good<00:00:53.160> bit<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.789> then

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
mesh so have a good bit of that and then

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.060 
mesh so have a good bit of that and then
down<00:00:54.090> here<00:00:54.510> there's<00:00:55.140> all<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.530> regular<00:00:55.890> white

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
down here there's all the regular white

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.450 
down here there's all the regular white
mesh<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:56.520> we've<00:00:56.640> got<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:57.449> whole<00:00:57.899> box<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.469> about

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
mesh so we've got a whole box of about

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.650 
mesh so we've got a whole box of about
200<00:01:00.180> or<00:01:00.300> about<00:01:00.510> 150<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.710> 125<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.940> 13<00:01:03.359> and

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
200 or about 150 to 125 of the 13 and

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.690 
200 or about 150 to 125 of the 13 and
then<00:01:04.320> another<00:01:04.769> box<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:06.170> about<00:01:07.670> 125<00:01:08.670> of

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
then another box of about 125 of

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.039 
then another box of about 125 of
13-millimeter<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.570> can<00:01:09.659> see<00:01:09.780> how<00:01:09.840> big

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
13-millimeter so you can see how big

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.580 
13-millimeter so you can see how big
these<00:01:10.140> boxes<00:01:10.590> are<00:01:10.820> so<00:01:11.820> about<00:01:12.240> 250<00:01:12.960> pieces<00:01:13.350> of

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
these boxes are so about 250 pieces of

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.330 
these boxes are so about 250 pieces of
the<00:01:13.770> 13<00:01:14.250> made<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.990> then<00:01:15.990> here<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.920> 15

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
the 13 made and then here is the 15

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.120 
the 13 made and then here is the 15
millimeter<00:01:17.520> mesh<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:18.060> we<00:01:18.180> have<00:01:18.360> all<00:01:18.600> made<00:01:18.750> up

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
millimeter mesh that we have all made up

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.399 
millimeter mesh that we have all made up
probably<00:01:20.130> another<00:01:20.340> 150<00:01:20.909> pieces<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.720> one

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
probably another 150 pieces of that one

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.359 
probably another 150 pieces of that one
box<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:23.659> then<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:25.200> whole<00:01:25.530> nother<00:01:25.740> box<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.220> it

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
box and then a whole nother box of it

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.410 
box and then a whole nother box of it
and<00:01:27.020> then<00:01:28.020> finally<00:01:28.799> we've<00:01:29.159> got<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.640> 20

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
and then finally we've got the 20

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.280 
and then finally we've got the 20
millimeter<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.460> the<00:01:32.720> six<00:01:33.720> diamond

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
millimeter and the six diamond

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.289 
millimeter and the six diamond
there<00:01:35.100> we<00:01:35.220> go<00:01:35.369> made<00:01:35.700> up<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:35.939> that's<00:01:36.000> all<00:01:36.210> the

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
there we go made up so that's all the

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.569 
there we go made up so that's all the
mesh<00:01:36.450> we<00:01:36.630> use<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:37.049> package<00:01:37.950> up<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.400> ship

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
mesh we use to package up and ship

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.580 
mesh we use to package up and ship
orders<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.420> we've<00:01:39.689> got<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.840> ton<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.140> back<00:01:40.350> stock

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
orders so we've got a ton of back stock

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.499 
orders so we've got a ton of back stock
down<00:01:40.770> at<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.400> then<00:01:41.490> we<00:01:41.610> head<00:01:41.700> over<00:01:41.850> here<00:01:42.119> it's

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
down at and then we head over here it's

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.580 
down at and then we head over here it's
where<00:01:42.659> we<00:01:42.750> keep<00:01:43.220> rolling<00:01:44.220> with<00:01:44.369> materials<00:01:45.590> so

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
where we keep rolling with materials so

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.170 
where we keep rolling with materials so
when<00:01:46.979> we<00:01:47.070> get<00:01:47.159> our<00:01:47.220> Rome<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.610> your<00:01:47.700> orders<00:01:48.000> and
