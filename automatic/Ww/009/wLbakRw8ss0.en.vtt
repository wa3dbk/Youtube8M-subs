00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.780
 this montage 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.150
 in our case I'm going to start here 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.159
 riding with pandeló discs 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.439
 so I'm going to make a dough I'll get it 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.110
 a cutter in the same diameter as my 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.240
 push and I'm going to cut to get 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.579
 here the mass records so I 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.439
 start as follows between the 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.829
 first pasta recipe 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:13.140
 if I want to get wet with a chucu 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:14.129
 some tail I may be doing this 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.290
 process 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.889
 I'll go in with the brigadeiro later. 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.889
 White 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:27.040
 another layer of pandeló or 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:31.030
 any other body that I want a 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.950
 strawberry brigadeiro layer 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.299
 so we actually thought about that 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.540
 stuffing why is this child 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:39.849

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:49.780
 another mass disc again. 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:56.950
 Our White Brigadier Another Disquinho 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:03:04.049
 of mass again the brigadier of 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:08.829
 strawberry and here the last straw of 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:10.599
 to make the decoration what I 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:13.989
 I'll use it here look I'll put a 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:16.239
 little white squirt just to 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:19.290
 Here you can see our concepts that we 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:22.870

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.940

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.480
 I can do this here I'll take my 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:31.269
 push button and place it inside the 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:35.319
 concept of a ajeitadinha for 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:36.910
 Confectionery 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.190

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.410
 all the recipes I'm using here 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.940
 both the vanilla mass and the 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.280

 your home is you can see that here 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.290
 we have fillings with colors come well 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.090
 vibrant 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.160
 What I did, I took this basis 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.950
 white brigadeiro that you will have access 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.010
 to this recipe and after cold adds 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.349
 the gel dye goes according to the color 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.260
 that you want to be stronger a little more 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:13.660
 soft or adding mixture and I came back 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.430
 there the colored brigadeiro 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.060
 we can also use between layers 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:21.479
 chocolate shavings and pieces of 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.680
 fruit jams fruit jams 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.180
 always thinking that it is a product that 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.760
 usually stays at room temperature 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.220

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.250
 can be so perishable 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.440
