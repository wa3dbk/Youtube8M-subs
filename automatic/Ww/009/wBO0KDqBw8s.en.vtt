00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.030 
they're giving you it's a really good
price<00:02:15.040> it<00:02:15.400> was<00:02:15.580> like<00:02:15.760> ninety<00:02:16.209> dollars<00:02:16.390> and<00:02:17.040> i

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
price it was like ninety dollars and i

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.100 
price it was like ninety dollars and i
think<00:02:18.430> was<00:02:18.520> like<00:02:18.640> a<00:02:18.670> thirty-dollar<00:02:19.239> shipping

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
think was like a thirty-dollar shipping

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.690 
think was like a thirty-dollar shipping
charge<00:02:20.410> so<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.800> whole<00:02:20.950> thing<00:02:21.160> was<00:02:21.310> like<00:02:21.340> about

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
charge so the whole thing was like about

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.960 
charge so the whole thing was like about
120<00:02:22.390> bucks<00:02:22.500> there's<00:02:23.500> also<00:02:23.860> when<00:02:24.580> you<00:02:24.670> go<00:02:24.819> on

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
120 bucks there's also when you go on

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.199 
120 bucks there's also when you go on
Amazon<00:02:25.300> you<00:02:25.690> can<00:02:25.720> choose<00:02:26.440> from<00:02:26.739> a<00:02:27.250> plastic

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
Amazon you can choose from a plastic

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.259 
Amazon you can choose from a plastic
version<00:02:28.690> of<00:02:28.810> this<00:02:29.019> which<00:02:29.290> I<00:02:30.280> assume<00:02:30.910> looks

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
version of this which I assume looks

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.570 
version of this which I assume looks
exactly<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:32.019> same<00:02:32.170> I<00:02:32.709> mean<00:02:33.040> a<00:02:33.220> learning<00:02:33.459> to

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
exactly the same I mean a learning to

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.729 
exactly the same I mean a learning to
think<00:02:33.730> you<00:02:33.880> could<00:02:34.060> tell<00:02:34.300> they<00:02:35.200> probably<00:02:35.470> make

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
think you could tell they probably make

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.530 
think you could tell they probably make
it<00:02:35.860> so<00:02:36.040> realistic<00:02:36.640> that<00:02:36.670> you<00:02:36.910> can't<00:02:37.120> even<00:02:37.209> tell

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
it so realistic that you can't even tell

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.440 
it so realistic that you can't even tell
it<00:02:37.720> that<00:02:37.930> it<00:02:38.470> looks<00:02:38.650> plastic<00:02:38.920> and<00:02:39.459> that's<00:02:40.060> even

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
it that it looks plastic and that's even

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.150 
it that it looks plastic and that's even
when<00:02:40.600> twenty<00:02:40.959> dollars<00:02:41.290> less<00:02:41.590> i<00:02:41.799> think<00:02:41.980> that's

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
when twenty dollars less i think that's

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.250 
when twenty dollars less i think that's
about<00:02:42.280> like<00:02:42.459> if<00:02:43.150> i<00:02:43.299> remember<00:02:43.510> about<00:02:43.690> seventy

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
about like if i remember about seventy

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.979 
about like if i remember about seventy
three<00:02:44.500> dollars<00:02:44.920> and<00:02:45.360> this<00:02:46.360> thing<00:02:46.630> really<00:02:46.870> does

three dollars and this thing really does

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.850 
three dollars and this thing really does
