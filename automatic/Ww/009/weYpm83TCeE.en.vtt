00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
hi this is Michael and this is my review

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.380 
hi this is Michael and this is my review
of<00:00:02.550> the<00:00:02.760> mio<00:00:03.360> Alfa<00:00:04.140> it's<00:00:04.470> a<00:00:04.650> strapless

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:05.390 
of the mio Alfa it's a strapless

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.049 
of the mio Alfa it's a strapless
continuous<00:00:06.390> heartrate<00:00:07.049> watch<00:00:07.560> and<00:00:08.099> this<00:00:08.880> is

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
continuous heartrate watch and this is

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.299 
continuous heartrate watch and this is
the<00:00:09.179> box<00:00:09.420> that<00:00:09.690> it<00:00:09.809> comes<00:00:09.990> in<00:00:10.260> this<00:00:11.040> is<00:00:11.190> the

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
the box that it comes in this is the

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.209 
the box that it comes in this is the
watch<00:00:11.490> it<00:00:11.969> has<00:00:12.269> a<00:00:12.300> really<00:00:12.719> really<00:00:13.139> nice<00:00:13.349> soft

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
watch it has a really really nice soft

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.740 
watch it has a really really nice soft
silicone<00:00:15.000> band

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
silicone band

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.990 
silicone band
I<00:00:15.780> think<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.920> watch<00:00:17.100> display<00:00:17.730> is<00:00:17.910> quite

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
I think the watch display is quite

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.349 
I think the watch display is quite
legible<00:00:19.070> however<00:00:20.070> one<00:00:20.460> big<00:00:20.760> negative<00:00:21.240> is

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
legible however one big negative is

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.840 
legible however one big negative is
there<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.689> no<00:00:21.869> backlight<00:00:22.410> on<00:00:22.439> this<00:00:22.769> so<00:00:23.609> if

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
there is no backlight on this so if

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.390 
there is no backlight on this so if
you're<00:00:24.060> in<00:00:24.240> low-light<00:00:24.930> conditions<00:00:25.070> or<00:00:26.070> night

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
you're in low-light conditions or night

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.880 
you're in low-light conditions or night
it's<00:00:26.849> very<00:00:27.090> difficult<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.660> see<00:00:27.869> you've<00:00:28.710> got

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
it's very difficult to see you've got

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.130 
it's very difficult to see you've got
several<00:00:29.310> indicators<00:00:29.760> on<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.240> watch<00:00:30.420> you<00:00:30.810> have

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
several indicators on the watch you have

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.990 
several indicators on the watch you have
a<00:00:31.170> battery<00:00:31.590> level<00:00:31.769> indicator<00:00:32.040> here<00:00:32.700> on<00:00:32.880> the

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
a battery level indicator here on the

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.840 
a battery level indicator here on the
left<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:34.190> then<00:00:35.190> there's<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.460> couple<00:00:35.670> other

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
left and then there's a couple other

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.459 
left and then there's a couple other
indicators<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:36.480> show<00:00:36.809> up<00:00:36.960> here<00:00:36.989> there's<00:00:37.380> an

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
indicators that show up here there's an

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.650 
indicators that show up here there's an
LED<00:00:37.649> here<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.399> flashes<00:00:38.969> depending<00:00:39.360> on<00:00:39.480> what

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
LED here that flashes depending on what

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.630 
LED here that flashes depending on what
mode<00:00:39.989> you're<00:00:40.260> in<00:00:40.290> when<00:00:40.980> you're<00:00:41.190> out<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.370> your

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
mode you're in when you're out of your

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.190 
mode you're in when you're out of your
heart<00:00:41.820> rate<00:00:42.000> zone<00:00:42.239> for<00:00:42.510> instance<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:43.050> will

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
heart rate zone for instance that will

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.950 
heart rate zone for instance that will
flash<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.860> then<00:00:44.430> there<00:00:44.879> are<00:00:45.000> two<00:00:45.239> buttons<00:00:45.539> and

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
flash and then there are two buttons and

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.049 
flash and then there are two buttons and
they're<00:00:46.680> kind<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.309> hard<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.640> see<00:00:47.850> because

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
they're kind of hard to see because

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.750 
they're kind of hard to see because
they're<00:00:48.390> really<00:00:48.510> integral<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.739> case<00:00:50.219> here

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
they're really integral to the case here

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.810 
they're really integral to the case here
but<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.510> can<00:00:51.690> see<00:00:51.870> this<00:00:52.050> long<00:00:52.550> piece<00:00:53.550> right

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
but you can see this long piece right

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.340 
but you can see this long piece right
here<00:00:53.879> that's<00:00:54.270> actually<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.750> button<00:00:54.960> and

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
here that's actually a button and

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.590 
here that's actually a button and
there's<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:55.980> button<00:00:56.070> on<00:00:56.370> each<00:00:56.579> side<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.239> that's

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
there's a button on each side and that's

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.569 
there's a button on each side and that's
it<00:00:58.020> there's<00:00:58.379> only<00:00:58.530> two<00:00:58.770> buttons<00:00:59.129> on<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.399> watch

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
it there's only two buttons on the watch

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.349 
it there's only two buttons on the watch
the<00:01:00.449> watch<00:01:00.480> band<00:01:00.989> has<00:01:01.320> three<00:01:01.739> prongs<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.579> like

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
the watch band has three prongs and like

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.270 
the watch band has three prongs and like
I<00:01:03.480> said<00:01:03.539> it's<00:01:03.870> very<00:01:04.110> soft<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.769> it's<00:01:04.890> actually

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
I said it's very soft and it's actually

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.310 
I said it's very soft and it's actually
quite<00:01:05.430> comfortable<00:01:05.850> on<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.750> underside<00:01:07.290> of

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
quite comfortable on the underside of

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.460 
quite comfortable on the underside of
the<00:01:07.500> watch<00:01:07.909> where<00:01:08.909> there<00:01:09.030> are<00:01:09.150> two<00:01:09.360> LEDs<00:01:09.960> here

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
the watch where there are two LEDs here

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.469 
the watch where there are two LEDs here
and<00:01:10.680> these<00:01:11.040> are<00:01:11.720> actually<00:01:12.720> what<00:01:13.520> can<00:01:14.520> read<00:01:15.119> the

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
and these are actually what can read the

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.560 
and these are actually what can read the
blood<00:01:15.780> flow<00:01:16.259> through<00:01:16.590> your<00:01:17.009> capillaries<00:01:17.700> so

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
blood flow through your capillaries so

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.109 
blood flow through your capillaries so
once<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.960> locks<00:01:19.140> on<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.799> you'll<00:01:20.729> start

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
once it locks on to that you'll start

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.450 
once it locks on to that you'll start
getting<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.810> indication<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.860> your<00:01:22.890> heart

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.109 
getting the indication of your heart
rate<00:01:23.640> on<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.180> watch<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.869> then<00:01:25.560> these<00:01:25.710> four

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
rate on the watch and then these four

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.880 
rate on the watch and then these four
contacts<00:01:27.119> up<00:01:27.360> here<00:01:27.659> this<00:01:27.900> has<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.140> really<00:01:28.439> kind

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
contacts up here this has a really kind

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.370 
contacts up here this has a really kind
of<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.100> cool<00:01:29.430> little<00:01:29.640> charger<00:01:30.329> this<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.110> the

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
of a cool little charger this is the

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.330 
of a cool little charger this is the
charger<00:01:31.860> right<00:01:32.040> here<00:01:32.540> it's<00:01:33.540> magnetized<00:01:34.229> so<00:01:34.619> it

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
charger right here it's magnetized so it

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.789 
charger right here it's magnetized so it
clicks<00:01:35.939> on<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.900> back<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.320> watch<00:01:37.530> and

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
clicks on to the back of the watch and

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.190 
clicks on to the back of the watch and
sort<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.070> magnetically<00:01:39.030> stays<00:01:39.360> attached<00:01:39.840> and

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
sort of magnetically stays attached and

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.140 
sort of magnetically stays attached and
then<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:40.950> just<00:01:41.159> gets<00:01:41.369> connected<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.030> USB

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
then this just gets connected to a USB

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.990 
then this just gets connected to a USB

an<00:01:54.630> hour<00:01:54.920> you're<00:01:55.920> probably<00:01:56.100> going<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.430> get<00:01:56.520> at

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
an hour you're probably going to get at

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.510 
an hour you're probably going to get at
least<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:57.030> week<00:01:57.210> maybe<00:01:57.600> even<00:01:58.049> more<00:01:58.560> maybe<00:01:59.250> up<00:01:59.490> to

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
least a week maybe even more maybe up to

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.240 
least a week maybe even more maybe up to
two<00:01:59.759> weeks<00:01:59.790> if<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:01.170> just<00:02:01.500> turn<00:02:01.740> this<00:02:01.950> on

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
two weeks if you just turn this on

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.130 
two weeks if you just turn this on
continuously<00:02:03.060> maybe<00:02:03.329> you're<00:02:03.479> not<00:02:03.600> using<00:02:03.869> this

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
continuously maybe you're not using this

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.280 
continuously maybe you're not using this
for<00:02:04.530> athletic<00:02:05.520> events<00:02:06.479> maybe<00:02:06.659> you're<00:02:06.990> just

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
for athletic events maybe you're just

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.589 
for athletic events maybe you're just
wanting<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.950> monitor<00:02:08.310> your<00:02:08.459> heart<00:02:08.640> rate<00:02:08.759> which

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
wanting to monitor your heart rate which

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.110 
wanting to monitor your heart rate which
is<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.780> perfectly<00:02:10.229> valid<00:02:10.319> use<00:02:10.860> for<00:02:11.099> this<00:02:11.220> if<00:02:11.790> you

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
is a perfectly valid use for this if you

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.790 
is a perfectly valid use for this if you
leave<00:02:12.420> this<00:02:12.629> heart<00:02:12.930> rate<00:02:13.080> monitor<00:02:13.530> on

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
leave this heart rate monitor on

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.740 
leave this heart rate monitor on
continuously<00:02:14.490> you're<00:02:15.210> probably<00:02:15.480> going<00:02:15.660> to

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
continuously you're probably going to

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.780 
continuously you're probably going to
have<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:15.930> recharge<00:02:16.380> your<00:02:16.530> watch<00:02:16.740> once<00:02:17.460> every

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
have to recharge your watch once every

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:18.980 
have to recharge your watch once every
day<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.120> a<00:02:18.150> half<00:02:18.330> or<00:02:18.570> so

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
day and a half or so

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.890 
day and a half or so
so<00:02:19.740> battery<00:02:20.220> life<00:02:20.430> is<00:02:20.670> pretty<00:02:21.150> good<00:02:21.330> but<00:02:21.600> you

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
so battery life is pretty good but you

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.980 
so battery life is pretty good but you
know<00:02:22.020> not<00:02:22.260> necessarily<00:02:23.720> fantastic<00:02:24.720> but<00:02:24.960> I

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
know not necessarily fantastic but I

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.260 
know not necessarily fantastic but I
think<00:02:25.350> it's<00:02:25.470> pretty<00:02:25.620> decent<00:02:25.890> now<00:02:26.880> there's<00:02:27.180> a

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
think it's pretty decent now there's a

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.990 
think it's pretty decent now there's a
couple<00:02:27.420> of<00:02:27.540> concerns<00:02:27.990> I<00:02:28.230> have<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:29.490> bezel

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
couple of concerns I have the the bezel

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.270 
couple of concerns I have the the bezel
of<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.150> watch<00:02:30.420> actually<00:02:31.080> sort<00:02:31.650> of<00:02:31.770> sticks<00:02:32.070> out

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
of the watch actually sort of sticks out

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.490 
of the watch actually sort of sticks out
a<00:02:32.310> little<00:02:32.430> bit<00:02:32.760> so<00:02:33.540> if<00:02:33.960> you're<00:02:34.110> not<00:02:34.260> careful

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
a little bit so if you're not careful

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.680 
a little bit so if you're not careful
this<00:02:34.830> is<00:02:34.890> gonna<00:02:35.190> be<00:02:35.730> pretty<00:02:36.030> prone<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:36.540> getting

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
this is gonna be pretty prone to getting

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.210 
this is gonna be pretty prone to getting
scratched<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.530> dinged<00:02:38.120> so<00:02:39.120> I<00:02:39.150> think<00:02:39.890> that's<00:02:40.890> a

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
scratched and dinged so I think that's a

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.130 
scratched and dinged so I think that's a
design<00:02:41.670> element<00:02:42.180> that<00:02:42.240> maybe<00:02:42.600> wasn't<00:02:42.960> thought

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
design element that maybe wasn't thought

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.300 
design element that maybe wasn't thought
out<00:02:43.200> too<00:02:43.590> well

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
out too well

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.970 
out too well
also<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.090> backlight<00:02:45.570> as<00:02:45.780> I<00:02:45.930> mentioned<00:02:46.410> seems

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
also the backlight as I mentioned seems

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.740 
also the backlight as I mentioned seems
kind<00:02:47.280> of<00:02:47.370> necessary<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:47.940> have<00:02:48.060> a<00:02:48.090> backlight<00:02:48.600> of

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
kind of necessary to have a backlight of

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.410 
kind of necessary to have a backlight of
some<00:02:48.960> sort<00:02:49.230> on<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.560> watch<00:02:49.830> like<00:02:50.070> this<00:02:50.360> now<00:02:51.360> the

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
some sort on a watch like this now the

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.230 
some sort on a watch like this now the
way<00:02:51.600> this<00:02:51.780> works<00:02:52.110> is<00:02:52.380> you<00:02:53.100> attach<00:02:53.820> it<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.180> your

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
way this works is you attach it to your

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.580 
way this works is you attach it to your
wrist<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:56.930> depending<00:02:57.930> on<00:02:58.050> your<00:02:58.200> dexterity

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
wrist and depending on your dexterity

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.740 
wrist and depending on your dexterity
that's<00:02:59.190> either<00:02:59.640> gonna<00:02:59.760> be<00:02:59.940> very<00:03:00.120> easy<00:03:00.360> to<00:03:00.480> do

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
that's either gonna be very easy to do

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.480 
that's either gonna be very easy to do
or<00:03:01.050> if<00:03:01.350> you're<00:03:01.500> like<00:03:01.680> me<00:03:01.920> it<00:03:02.070> might<00:03:02.220> take<00:03:02.460> a

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
or if you're like me it might take a

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.630 
or if you're like me it might take a
couple<00:03:02.820> minutes<00:03:03.030> -<00:03:04.220> but<00:03:05.220> that's<00:03:05.400> another

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
couple minutes - but that's another

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.300 
couple minutes - but that's another
story<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.180> then<00:03:07.050> there<00:03:07.470> are<00:03:07.500> a<00:03:07.680> couple<00:03:07.950> little

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
story and then there are a couple little

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.850 
story and then there are a couple little
prongs<00:03:08.640> here<00:03:09.210> that<00:03:09.510> they<00:03:09.720> just<00:03:09.930> attach<00:03:10.380> into

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
prongs here that they just attach into

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.040 
prongs here that they just attach into
the<00:03:10.980> holes<00:03:11.220> do<00:03:11.910> you<00:03:11.970> press<00:03:12.240> the<00:03:12.450> right<00:03:12.660> button

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
the holes do you press the right button

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.430 
the holes do you press the right button
here<00:03:13.320> for<00:03:13.740> a<00:03:14.160> couple<00:03:14.850> seconds<00:03:15.270> and<00:03:15.450> now<00:03:16.230> it's

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
here for a couple seconds and now it's

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.949 
here for a couple seconds and now it's
gonna<00:03:16.620> find<00:03:17.010> my<00:03:17.220> heart<00:03:17.400> rate<00:03:17.670> now<00:03:18.270> normally<00:03:18.780> I

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
gonna find my heart rate now normally I

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.630 
gonna find my heart rate now normally I
find<00:03:19.380> that<00:03:19.560> this<00:03:19.709> finds<00:03:20.010> my<00:03:20.220> heart<00:03:20.489> rate

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
find that this finds my heart rate

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.310 
find that this finds my heart rate
within<00:03:20.850> 15<00:03:21.480> seconds<00:03:22.110> or<00:03:22.370> so<00:03:23.930> for<00:03:24.930> reasons<00:03:25.260> that

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
within 15 seconds or so for reasons that

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.080 
within 15 seconds or so for reasons that
I<00:03:25.440> don't<00:03:25.470> fully<00:03:25.830> understand<00:03:26.430> sometimes<00:03:26.730> it

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
I don't fully understand sometimes it

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.060 
I don't fully understand sometimes it
takes<00:03:27.270> a<00:03:27.360> little<00:03:27.510> longer<00:03:27.959> so<00:03:28.590> I'm<00:03:28.709> all<00:03:28.890> excited

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
takes a little longer so I'm all excited

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.160 
takes a little longer so I'm all excited
this<00:03:29.520> morning<00:03:29.580> talking<00:03:30.090> about<00:03:30.270> the<00:03:30.510> mio<00:03:30.690> Alfa

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
this morning talking about the mio Alfa

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.190 
this morning talking about the mio Alfa
so<00:03:31.350> my<00:03:31.470> heart<00:03:31.680> rate<00:03:31.860> right<00:03:32.010> now<00:03:32.160> is<00:03:32.550> at<00:03:32.670> 88<00:03:33.200> so

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
so my heart rate right now is at 88 so

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.470 
so my heart rate right now is at 88 so
right<00:03:34.620> now<00:03:34.800> it'll<00:03:35.130> just<00:03:35.250> read<00:03:35.820> my<00:03:36.030> heart<00:03:36.270> rate

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
right now it'll just read my heart rate

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.510 
right now it'll just read my heart rate
and<00:03:37.050> it'll<00:03:37.230> keep<00:03:37.650> reading<00:03:37.980> my<00:03:38.100> heart<00:03:38.340> rate

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
and it'll keep reading my heart rate

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.090 
and it'll keep reading my heart rate
until<00:03:38.940> I<00:03:38.970> get<00:03:39.209> out<00:03:39.360> of<00:03:39.540> this<00:03:39.660> mode<00:03:39.959> but<00:03:40.830> you<00:03:40.950> can

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
until I get out of this mode but you can

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.590 
until I get out of this mode but you can
see<00:03:41.340> there's<00:03:41.610> the<00:03:41.820> flashing<00:03:42.330> heart<00:03:42.600> here<00:03:43.080> and

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
see there's the flashing heart here and

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.770 
see there's the flashing heart here and
now<00:03:45.600> the<00:03:45.660> left<00:03:46.230> button<00:03:46.800> is<00:03:47.040> a<00:03:47.400> set<00:03:48.180> button<00:03:48.510> and

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:42.499 
has ended then you can review your
session<00:05:40.949> by<00:05:41.219> pushing<00:05:41.490> the<00:05:41.729> left<00:05:41.909> button<00:05:42.270> and

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:42.509 
session by pushing the left button and

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:46.159 
session by pushing the left button and
it'll<00:05:43.500> go<00:05:44.159> through<00:05:44.430> the<00:05:44.909> last<00:05:45.360> run<00:05:45.780> the<00:05:46.020> length

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169 
it'll go through the last run the length

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:49.040 
it'll go through the last run the length
of<00:05:46.409> the<00:05:46.469> last<00:05:46.710> run<00:05:47.070> and<00:05:47.340> then<00:05:48.330> it'll<00:05:48.630> tell<00:05:48.930> you

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
of the last run and then it'll tell you

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.999 
of the last run and then it'll tell you
your<00:05:49.229> average<00:05:49.520> heartbeat<00:05:50.520> and<00:05:51.770> then<00:05:52.770> it'll

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:53.009 
your average heartbeat and then it'll

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:56.230 
your average heartbeat and then it'll
tell<00:05:53.250> you<00:05:53.340> how<00:05:53.370> long<00:05:53.699> you<00:05:53.880> were<00:05:54.000> in<00:05:54.030> your<00:05:54.300> zone

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
tell you how long you were in your zone

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.390 
tell you how long you were in your zone
so<00:05:57.240> it's<00:05:57.659> a<00:05:57.810> good<00:05:58.020> I<00:05:58.169> think<00:05:58.469> it's<00:05:58.620> a<00:05:58.740> first<00:05:58.979> stab

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
so it's a good I think it's a first stab

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.689 
so it's a good I think it's a first stab
kind<00:06:00.360> of<00:06:00.479> a<00:06:00.569> heartbeat<00:06:01.440> watch<00:06:01.740> I<00:06:02.099> mean<00:06:02.340> it's

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:02.699 
kind of a heartbeat watch I mean it's

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:04.399 
kind of a heartbeat watch I mean it's
really<00:06:02.880> nice<00:06:03.210> but<00:06:03.690> I<00:06:03.719> would<00:06:03.960> like<00:06:04.080> to<00:06:04.139> see

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:04.409 
really nice but I would like to see

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:06.320 
really nice but I would like to see
laughs<00:06:04.710> I<00:06:05.009> would<00:06:05.159> like<00:06:05.280> to<00:06:05.400> see<00:06:05.610> a<00:06:05.849> longer

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
laughs I would like to see a longer

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.309 
laughs I would like to see a longer
history<00:06:06.800> a<00:06:07.800> few<00:06:08.520> things<00:06:08.759> like<00:06:08.969> that<00:06:09.030> but<00:06:09.509> for

00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:10.319 
history a few things like that but for

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:12.649 
history a few things like that but for
right<00:06:10.590> now<00:06:10.650> this<00:06:11.099> is<00:06:11.280> where<00:06:11.490> the<00:06:11.759> technology

00:06:12.649 --> 00:06:12.659 
right now this is where the technology

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:15.409 
right now this is where the technology
is<00:06:12.690> and<00:06:13.199> I<00:06:13.889> think<00:06:14.099> it's<00:06:14.250> a<00:06:14.340> good<00:06:14.580> first<00:06:14.849> attempt

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:15.419 
is and I think it's a good first attempt

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:17.390 
is and I think it's a good first attempt
it's<00:06:15.539> very<00:06:15.719> comfortable<00:06:16.229> to<00:06:16.349> wear<00:06:16.380> and<00:06:16.800> I

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 
it's very comfortable to wear and I

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.670 
it's very comfortable to wear and I
really<00:06:17.729> do<00:06:17.940> like<00:06:18.150> it<00:06:18.389> actually<00:06:18.569> ok<00:06:19.469> there<00:06:19.650> are

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 
really do like it actually ok there are

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.249 
really do like it actually ok there are
some<00:06:19.800> people<00:06:20.130> who<00:06:20.610> are<00:06:20.639> saying<00:06:21.259> reporting

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:22.259 
some people who are saying reporting

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:24.129 
some people who are saying reporting
that<00:06:22.409> they're<00:06:22.560> getting<00:06:22.819> inaccurate<00:06:23.819> or

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:24.139 
that they're getting inaccurate or

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:27.409 
that they're getting inaccurate or
wildly<00:06:25.139> vacillating<00:06:25.949> heartbeat<00:06:26.419> readings

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419 
wildly vacillating heartbeat readings

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:29.740 
wildly vacillating heartbeat readings
when<00:06:27.750> it's<00:06:27.990> getting

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.750 
when it's getting

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:36.430 
when it's getting
so<00:06:30.750> I<00:06:31.790> just<00:06:32.790> want<00:06:33.030> to<00:06:33.210> just<00:06:33.870> prove<00:06:34.230> that<00:06:34.560> by

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:36.440 
so I just want to just prove that by

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.610 
so I just want to just prove that by
running<00:06:37.440> a<00:06:37.590> little<00:06:37.860> water<00:06:38.100> on<00:06:39.000> the<00:06:39.240> watch<00:06:39.620> and

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.620 
running a little water on the watch and

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.770 
running a little water on the watch and
as<00:06:41.550> you<00:06:41.700> can<00:06:41.880> see<00:06:41.940> the<00:06:42.480> heart<00:06:42.840> rate<00:06:43.050> is<00:06:44.780> just

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:45.780 
as you can see the heart rate is just

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:46.580 
as you can see the heart rate is just
pretty<00:06:46.080> normal

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:46.590 
pretty normal

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.660 
pretty normal
vacillating<00:06:47.430> between<00:06:48.620> 78<00:06:49.620> to<00:06:49.830> 82

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:50.670 
vacillating between 78 to 82

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:54.560 
vacillating between 78 to 82
I<00:06:50.700> can<00:06:51.690> even<00:06:51.810> hold<00:06:52.440> the<00:06:52.590> watch<00:06:53.120> up<00:06:54.120> a<00:06:54.300> little

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:54.570 
I can even hold the watch up a little

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:56.420 
I can even hold the watch up a little
bit<00:06:54.720> and<00:06:54.840> let<00:06:55.020> water<00:06:55.200> actually<00:06:55.740> run<00:06:56.220> right

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:56.430 
bit and let water actually run right

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:01.100 
bit and let water actually run right
under<00:06:56.610> it<00:06:56.880> and<00:06:58.010> it's<00:06:59.330> still<00:07:00.330> giving<00:07:00.660> a<00:07:00.780> pretty

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:01.110 
under it and it's still giving a pretty

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:02.930 
under it and it's still giving a pretty
accurate<00:07:01.350> reading<00:07:01.890> I<00:07:01.980> would<00:07:02.040> say<00:07:02.370> and<00:07:02.580> not

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:02.940 
accurate reading I would say and not

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:07.610 
accurate reading I would say and not
only<00:07:03.240> that<00:07:03.420> it's<00:07:03.690> waterproof<00:07:05.180> and<00:07:06.320> right<00:07:07.320> here

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:07.620 
only that it's waterproof and right here

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:10.550 
only that it's waterproof and right here
I'm<00:07:07.830> going<00:07:08.040> to<00:07:08.330> disprove<00:07:09.330> people<00:07:10.140> are<00:07:10.230> saying

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 
I'm going to disprove people are saying

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.040 
I'm going to disprove people are saying
that<00:07:10.830> movement<00:07:11.670> moving<00:07:11.970> the<00:07:12.210> arms<00:07:12.570> was<00:07:12.750> giving

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.050 
that movement moving the arms was giving

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.350 
that movement moving the arms was giving
inaccurate<00:07:13.620> readings<00:07:13.980> so<00:07:14.250> I've<00:07:14.820> just<00:07:14.850> done

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 
inaccurate readings so I've just done

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.000 
inaccurate readings so I've just done
the<00:07:15.510> water<00:07:15.720> test<00:07:16.170> so<00:07:16.350> I<00:07:16.380> probably<00:07:16.620> still<00:07:16.950> have

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.010 
the water test so I probably still have

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:20.120 
the water test so I probably still have
water<00:07:17.430> under<00:07:17.940> the<00:07:18.030> watch<00:07:18.210> but<00:07:18.860> I'm<00:07:19.860> just<00:07:19.980> gonna

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:20.130 
water under the watch but I'm just gonna

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:23.240 
water under the watch but I'm just gonna
wiggle<00:07:20.460> my<00:07:20.700> arm<00:07:20.910> around<00:07:21.180> here<00:07:21.800> this<00:07:22.800> is<00:07:22.950> a<00:07:23.010> lot

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:23.250 
wiggle my arm around here this is a lot

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:25.160 
wiggle my arm around here this is a lot
more<00:07:23.430> violent<00:07:24.030> than<00:07:24.180> you<00:07:24.300> would<00:07:24.480> ever<00:07:24.510> have<00:07:24.870> if

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:25.170 
more violent than you would ever have if

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:34.010 
more violent than you would ever have if
you're<00:07:25.350> running<00:07:26.420> but<00:07:27.420> as<00:07:27.600> you<00:07:27.750> can<00:07:27.930> see<00:07:33.020> you

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:34.020 
you're running but as you can see you

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.170 
you're running but as you can see you
know<00:07:34.170> it's<00:07:34.590> not<00:07:34.800> giving<00:07:35.640> me<00:07:35.790> wildly

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:36.180 
know it's not giving me wildly

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.320 
know it's not giving me wildly
inaccurate<00:07:36.660> readings<00:07:37.290> whatsoever<00:07:38.240> if<00:07:39.240> you

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:39.330 
inaccurate readings whatsoever if you

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:40.580 
inaccurate readings whatsoever if you
have<00:07:39.420> any<00:07:39.570> questions<00:07:39.990> leave<00:07:40.170> me<00:07:40.200> a<00:07:40.320> comment
