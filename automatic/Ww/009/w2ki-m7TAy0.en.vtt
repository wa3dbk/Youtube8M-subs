00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.190
Hi I'm Dan Musick and today we're going to
show you how to replace cables on a Wayne

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.890
Dalton Torquemaster spring system first thing
we do is mark where the cable goes into the

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.440
 first thing we do is mark where the cable goes into the cable drum

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.320
you can just get a piece of electrical
tape and wrap this around the point where

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:34.120
it goes in the drum we're going to use this
to measure measure the cable, now we're assuming

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.940
 now we're assuming that you have one cable that's not broken

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.040
if you if both your cables are broken or if

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:48.010
they've already been taken out you'll need
to measure the cable and you'll need to put

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:55.350
this mark at the 7 ' 10" so the 7' 10"s would
be at this point right here 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.220
which is right exactly where it goes into the cable drum
that's for a 7' high door

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.840
for an 8' foot high door it would be 8' 10"

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.280
and then you can do
the math on if you had a 6' high door 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.900
just subtract 6" from the 7' high dimension so
you first mark the cable then you pop the

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.860
so
you first mark the cable then you pop the

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.189
bearing out with the screw driver it comes
out pretty easily

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.840
then you can see the cable there

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.480
if the cable won't come out because
of the set screw holding it so locate the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:44.230
set screw loosen the set screw about 3 turns
then you can push the cable from this side

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.440
until it comes out the other side of the drum
pull that out 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.640
and now you can pull this cable out of the drum

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.580
so the next step is to mark
the new cable 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.380
we do this either by measuring

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:13.420
the cable or if you have the old cable intact
you put the two together you pinch this end

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:22.170
and then you pull on it pinch here again pull
again pinch here pull until you get to the

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:37.210
point where we marked it earlier and here
we will tape the new cable mark that 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.589
so the new cable is marked notice that it's a little
longer

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.840
now we'll install this cable in the drum

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.500
so we find the end of the cable

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.840
the cable
goes into the inside the drum turn it

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:08.000
and pull on the cable you keep pulling on the
cable until you get your mark up here

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.640
at this point

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:25.420
we insert the end of this cable into
this hole that's here notice the little hole there 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.680
it goes in there

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.579
and then it comes out
the other side just under the set screw and

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:44.939
you pull on that check your spacing here with
the tape and then we tighten the set screw

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.840
you won't feel any pressure until the set
screw first hits the cable and then once it gets

00:03:52.849 --> 00:04:01.409
to the cable you add about half a turn of
tension turn that torque and turn it about

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:07.449
half a turn next install the bearing

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.180
 it doesn't
fit right in so you'll need to press it against your work bench

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:27.639
so now the bearing is in there
and we're all set except for the extra cable

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:33.970
that we have out here now to cut this in the
trades we use a cable cutter I usually leave

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:40.970
about an extra foot if you don't have cable
cutters side cutters won't work probably the

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:50.440
best thing to do is either torch it or use
um a little grinding wheel dremle tool

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.180
there's different ways to get that off

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.500
so when you
put that on the shaft you can either tape

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:03.650
it or leave it there it usually won't be a
problem now you do remember that only 3/32"

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:10.129
cable will work with this particular drum
the standard 1/8" cable that we use for most

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:20.620
cable drums won't work so I wish you all the best
as you replace these cables thank you for
