00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:15.019
 today there is a lot of talk about quality but what is this quality 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:20.630
 surely there is a quality that we all call I like not me 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:21.289
 like it 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.009
 and this is the subjective quality of my personal life 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:26.869
 that's fine of course 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:28.050
 pros and reality 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.550
 taster looking for something more than a more objective quality 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.610
 tasting is not just a means of making a good impression with one's friends 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.600
 telling what you see what feels like a means to enjoy it for sure 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.780
 more than what you are eating and of course high school that you are drinking 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.300
 recognize the quality 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.910
 there is a discipline or an art to better say that the tasting is now 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.440
 we will discover its secrets together 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.890
 in order to fully savor a wine we have to start with siwon 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.940
 the wine is looked preserved but we will discover it through its colors 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.080
 we may already have plenty of information on what awaits us 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.450
 later in fact the next part sky nose 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.990
 a component of active usually and that - used by non-experts 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.720
 perhaps because 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.350
 feel with your nose make a blowjob in deception or not always allow 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.730
 collect the feelings that we all want to have inside the 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:42.090
 our mind then doyle done usually displaces us yet with the 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.440
 nose you can gather a lot of information 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.980
 in positive or sometimes it is also indicative in us finally 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.960
 the wine to be tasted and then we taste it 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.080
 a small sip 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:03.410
 it will be more than enough to understand if the quality we have previously observed 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:09.250
 you can evaluate with the nose that will be able to give yourself a magical sip 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.340
 we will soon discover disagreements with the think u stills of wines that I will try 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.560
 but before tasting together it is useful to remember that quality comes into being 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.940
 ticket but materializes in the cellar we hear from the words and bigger 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.740
 expert as this quality can pass from the right to the glass 

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:39.749
 burt territory 2 basic elements 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.809
 in the future quality of wine 

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:46.399
 the same territory will give us different teleperformance and complements in 

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:51.159
 function of the kendrick vines as logically the same citrate vine 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:54.469
 different results infusion of the territory where we will go to the plant 

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:59.609
 the two characteristics of knowledge are of fundamental importance 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:03.959
 in every wine project we must know a physico-chemical characteristics a 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.009
 This will allow us to choose the right rootstock 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.469
 as the environment we must know the climatic conditions will allow us to 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:14.739
 choose the vine that will most resist these conditions 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.059
 weather 

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:19.760
 sometimes the choice of these two elements is knowledge and therefore can be managed 

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:23.969
 it means to have a quality other than a fairly low target 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:28.369
 everything that happens in the cellar and technology if we in the vineyard do not 

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:32.689
 we can keep the best quality i sing we can fail is a way of e 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:35.209
