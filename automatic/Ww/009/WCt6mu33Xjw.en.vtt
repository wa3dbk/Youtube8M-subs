00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:07.920
 Audience 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.560
 Welcome to the "Weather Cold Knowledge" of this episode 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.920
 Hong Kong is going to be a wind every year 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.160
 Reviewing past history, whether pre-war or post-war 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.040
 Hong Kong has also experienced some serious windstorms. 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.440
 And the most serious typhoon after the war 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.000
 It was Wen Qi in 1962. 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.080
 When the Observatory used to hang the No. 10 typhoon 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.040
 This storm actually has two characteristics. 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.400
 The first is the wind is very big 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.200
 The highest gust recorded at the Observatory 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.480
 259 kilometers per hour 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.080
 This record has not broken yet today. 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.400
 The second is causing a serious storm surge 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.800
 Because Wen Wei was skipped at a very close south of Hong Kong. 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:01.160
 It was then routed in Hong Kong near Cheung Chau. 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.400
 Most parts of Hong Kong are in the right windy area on the right side. 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.600
 Blowing east wind and northeast wind 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.120
 These winds blow the waves into Tolo Harbour. 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.040
 Let the water level rise 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.680
 At that time, the water level in Tolo Harbour exceeded 5 meters. 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.120
 The water level in Victoria Harbour is also close to 4 meters. 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.640
 Drowning in many places 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.280
 Sha Tin is the hardest hit 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.800
 Many places are severe flooding 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.680
 The storm killed more than 180 people 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.240
 Thousands of people have been affected 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.200
 We are fortunate to have a digital number in June this year. 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.280
 The elderly who had experienced the devastating winds in the past visited the Observatory. 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.720
 When they see old photos 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.560
 Then they recalled the memories of their warmth when they hit Hong Kong. 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.320
 Listen to what they say about the storm 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.600
 After the storm 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:01.960
 Many corpses along the beaches of Cheung Chau 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.920
 Some are still floating on the sea 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:15.640
 My brother and I took the corpses back to the shore and prevented them from rushing out of the sea. 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:23.320
 At that time, I estimated that there should be dozens of corpses. 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.880
 The strongest wind is blowing from the back hospital road to Xinjie 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.640
 Then, the new street will pass through Queen's Road West and crash into the Gaosheng Theatre. 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.920
 There is nothing in the building. 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.560
 But I saw that signboard is crumbling 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:45.480
 The signboard is from the second floor to the rooftop, with a total height of four floors. 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.160
 90 degrees turn to the cross street 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.200
 The signboard fell to the ground 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.440
 I used to live near the Chai warehouse in Haitang, North Point. 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.080
 There is an iron boat moored on the shore 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.360
 The waves hit the ship to the shore 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.640
 The waves are more than 20 feet high 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.080
 The waves are like a wave of hills. 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.080
 The ship sinks when the waves recede 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.120
 The wind was very strong at the time. 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.560
 Rumble when blowing to the wall 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.920
 It’s still a memorable impression after decades. 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.800
 Pursuit of stimulation to stay behind 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.360
 Sudden wind speed 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.520
 Small piece of static ignorance 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.600
 When the heart is mad 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.480
 In fact, it’s not a joke. 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.440
 If Hong Kong is going to fight again, don’t take it lightly. 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.720
 Especially parents should not take children to see the waves. 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.000
 Instead, wind protection measures should be taken to protect family safety. 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.360
 As Liu Bobo said, "Catch the wind carefully." 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.760
 Everyone should remember 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.200
 The "Weather Cold Knowledge" in this episode ends here. 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.560
 Thank you for watching.
