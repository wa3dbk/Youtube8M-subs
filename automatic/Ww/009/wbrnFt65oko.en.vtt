which is his best position which is
Rooney's<00:02:20.170> best<00:02:20.410> position<00:02:20.800> then<00:02:20.980> I<00:02:21.069> just

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
Rooney's best position then I just

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.250 
Rooney's best position then I just
thought<00:02:21.460> the<00:02:22.240> more<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.600> managers<00:02:22.990> going<00:02:23.140> to

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
thought the more the managers going to

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260 
thought the more the managers going to
go<00:02:23.350> against<00:02:23.770> that<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:24.100> he<00:02:24.400> never<00:02:24.610> once<00:02:24.910> played

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.780 
go against that and he never once played
that<00:02:25.450> win<00:02:25.660> and<00:02:25.959> for<00:02:26.230> me<00:02:26.380> it<00:02:26.950> summed<00:02:27.430> it<00:02:27.520> up<00:02:27.610> in

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
that win and for me it summed it up in

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.820 
that win and for me it summed it up in
the<00:02:27.910> last<00:02:28.090> 15<00:02:28.750> minutes<00:02:28.840> when<00:02:29.260> we<00:02:29.380> need<00:02:29.590> three

defensively I've ever seen and then mix
into<00:03:01.959> that<00:03:02.230> probably<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:02.770> worst<00:03:03.010> back<00:03:03.310> for

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
into that probably the worst back for

into that probably the worst back for
performance<00:03:04.630> of<00:03:04.690> seeing<00:03:04.900> defensively<00:03:05.440> then

fair play to the Germans you have to

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.590 
fair play to the Germans you have to
give<00:03:09.520> them<00:03:09.670> great<00:03:09.910> credit<00:03:10.209> because<00:03:10.300> they<00:03:10.390> look

couldn't cope with and when they got at
our<00:03:18.250> bat<00:03:18.520> for<00:03:18.790> we<00:03:19.209> completely<00:03:19.810> fell<00:03:20.020> apart<00:03:20.050> on

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
our bat for we completely fell apart on

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.199 
our bat for we completely fell apart on
it<00:03:20.620> and<00:03:20.800> quite<00:03:21.040> frankly<00:03:21.280> it<00:03:21.700> was<00:03:21.819> awful

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
it and quite frankly it was awful

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:23.970 
it and quite frankly it was awful
usually<00:03:22.690> when<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:22.900> bike<00:03:23.080> fall<00:03:23.350> is<00:03:23.500> that<00:03:23.739> bad

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
usually when the bike fall is that bad

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.490 
usually when the bike fall is that bad
the<00:03:24.760> goalkeeper<00:03:25.300> is<00:03:25.480> culpable<00:03:26.140> as<00:03:26.290> well<00:03:26.470> I

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
the goalkeeper is culpable as well I

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.080 
the goalkeeper is culpable as well I
mean<00:03:26.680> David<00:03:27.010> James<00:03:27.190> may<00:03:27.400> I<00:03:27.430> see<00:03:27.700> one<00:03:27.910> of<00:03:27.940> them

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
mean David James may I see one of them

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.120 
mean David James may I see one of them
but<00:03:28.269> on<00:03:28.480> all<00:03:28.930> he<00:03:29.170> was<00:03:29.290> England's<00:03:29.590> best<00:03:29.830> player

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
but on all he was England's best player

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.910 
but on all he was England's best player
and<00:03:30.780> for<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:31.840> goalkeeper<00:03:32.260> to<00:03:32.290> play<00:03:32.560> quite

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
and for the goalkeeper to play quite

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.530 
and for the goalkeeper to play quite
well<00:03:33.130> on<00:03:33.160> a<00:03:33.370> performance<00:03:33.700> like<00:03:34.060> that<00:03:34.090> is

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
well on a performance like that is

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.840 
well on a performance like that is
highly<00:03:35.440> unusual<00:03:35.560> because<00:03:36.310> England<00:03:36.610> could

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
highly unusual because England could

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.300 
highly unusual because England could
have<00:03:36.970> conceivably<00:03:37.660> lost<00:03:38.110> 70<00:03:38.590> quite<00:03:38.890> easy<00:03:39.100> and

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
have conceivably lost 70 quite easy and

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.370 
have conceivably lost 70 quite easy and
that<00:03:39.730> the<00:03:39.970> way<00:03:40.300> that<00:03:40.480> the<00:03:40.600> Germans<00:03:40.989> counted

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
that the way that the Germans counted

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.780 
that the way that the Germans counted
attack<00:03:41.680> with<00:03:42.040> a<00:03:42.069> little<00:03:42.370> bit<00:03:42.489> of<00:03:42.580> bass<00:03:42.760> and

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
attack with a little bit of bass and

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.580 
attack with a little bit of bass and
like<00:03:43.209> Lisa's<00:03:43.600> good<00:03:43.870> passing<00:03:44.319> and<00:03:44.440> good

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
like Lisa's good passing and good

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.400 
like Lisa's good passing and good
movement<00:03:45.120> it<00:03:46.120> was<00:03:46.300> just<00:03:46.480> shambolic<00:03:47.050> it<00:03:47.200> really

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
movement it was just shambolic it really

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.960 
movement it was just shambolic it really
