I'm sure was mostly just muddled images
of<00:01:36.000> snow<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.320> hugely<00:01:37.560> embarrassing

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
of snow and this is hugely embarrassing

of snow and this is hugely embarrassing
was<00:01:38.400> me<00:01:38.640> at<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.210> top<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.780> pond<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.920> whole

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
was me at the top of the pond the whole

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.200 
was me at the top of the pond the whole
thing<00:01:41.280> essentially<00:01:41.610> has<00:01:41.790> become<00:01:42.000> one<00:01:42.149> giant

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
thing essentially has become one giant

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.600 
thing essentially has become one giant
slide<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.990> ice<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.440> I<00:01:43.920> slid<00:01:44.220> all<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.430> way<00:01:44.520> down

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
slide of ice and I slid all the way down

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.180 
slide of ice and I slid all the way down
and<00:01:45.000> into<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.899> pond<00:01:46.080> below<00:01:46.289> which<00:01:46.590> terrified

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
and into the pond below which terrified

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.289 
and into the pond below which terrified
me<00:01:47.340> because<00:01:47.580> if<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.729> would<00:01:47.850> have<00:01:47.940> broken<00:01:48.119> that

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
me because if I would have broken that

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.029 
me because if I would have broken that
ice<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.750> would<00:01:49.200> have<00:01:49.289> gone<00:01:49.350> into<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.619> water<00:01:49.770> not

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
ice I would have gone into the water not

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.520 
ice I would have gone into the water not
what<00:01:50.159> has<00:01:50.250> sucked<00:01:51.049> luckily<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.229> didn't<00:01:52.409> break

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
what has sucked luckily it didn't break

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.070 
what has sucked luckily it didn't break
but<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.490> did<00:01:53.670> spend<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.000> next<00:01:54.149> 10<00:01:54.509> or<00:01:54.659> 15

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
but I did spend the next 10 or 15

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.960 
but I did spend the next 10 or 15
minutes<00:01:55.110> trying<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.100> get<00:01:56.369> out<00:01:56.520> because<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:56.909> was

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
minutes trying to get out because it was

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.300 
minutes trying to get out because it was
essentially<00:01:57.390> just<00:01:57.509> walls<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:58.110> ice<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.560> that

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
essentially just walls of ice and that

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.090 
essentially just walls of ice and that
sucked<00:01:59.759> so<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.780> eventually<00:02:01.170> usually<00:02:01.740> treat

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
sucked so I eventually usually treat

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.309 
sucked so I eventually usually treat
like<00:02:02.369> now<00:02:02.610> eat<00:02:02.819> myself<00:02:03.060> out<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.569> eyes<00:02:03.659> none

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
like now eat myself out of the eyes none

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:07.160 
like now eat myself out of the eyes none
of<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.440> was<00:02:04.710> caught<00:02:04.890> on<00:02:04.920> camera<00:02:05.069> dang<00:02:05.970> it<00:02:06.170> my

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
of that was caught on camera dang it my

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.350 
of that was caught on camera dang it my
glasses<00:02:07.409> are<00:02:07.770> also<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.399> little<00:02:08.580> bit<00:02:08.789> so

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
glasses are also a little bit so

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.350 
glasses are also a little bit so
hopefully<00:02:09.479> that's<00:02:09.869> proof<00:02:10.110> enough<00:02:11.360> needless

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
hopefully that's proof enough needless

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.960 
hopefully that's proof enough needless
