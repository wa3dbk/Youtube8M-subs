make a hamster species that doesn't bite
well<00:01:06.990> I'll<00:01:07.170> just<00:01:07.229> go<00:01:07.560> through<00:01:07.799> all<00:01:07.890> the

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
well I'll just go through all the

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.640 
well I'll just go through all the
hamster<00:01:08.310> species<00:01:08.760> well<00:01:09.360> siren<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.500> would<00:01:10.619> think

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
hamster species well siren I would think

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.679 
hamster species well siren I would think
is<00:01:11.070> probably<00:01:11.520> if<00:01:11.820> you're<00:01:12.000> like<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.210> first-time

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
is probably if you're like a first-time

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.289 
is probably if you're like a first-time
owner<00:01:12.950> probably<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.040> best<00:01:14.250> they<00:01:14.820> do<00:01:15.030> seem<00:01:15.240> a

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
owner probably the best they do seem a

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.550 
owner probably the best they do seem a
little<00:01:15.450> bit<00:01:15.630> more<00:01:15.810> laid<00:01:16.049> back<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:18.350> they<00:01:19.350> are

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
little bit more laid back and they are

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.499 
little bit more laid back and they are
still<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.159> mean<00:01:20.549> there's<00:01:20.729> still<00:01:20.790> hamster<00:01:21.299> so

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
still I mean there's still hamster so

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.170 
still I mean there's still hamster so
there's<00:01:21.720> still<00:01:21.869> crazy<00:01:22.610> we're<00:01:23.610> not<00:01:23.700> like<00:01:23.729> crazy

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
there's still crazy we're not like crazy

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.820 
there's still crazy we're not like crazy
but<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.509> know<00:01:24.630> they're<00:01:24.900> hamsters<00:01:25.560> are<00:01:25.680> just

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
but you know they're hamsters are just

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.700 
but you know they're hamsters are just
active<00:01:26.250> animals<00:01:27.860> and<00:01:30.110> its<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.380> mean<00:01:31.439> definitely

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
active animals and its I mean definitely

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.609 
active animals and its I mean definitely
I<00:01:32.490> probably<00:01:33.000> not<00:01:33.270> repre<00:01:33.659> recommend<00:01:34.350> something

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
I probably not repre recommend something

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.179 
I probably not repre recommend something
like<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:35.040> robot<00:01:35.520> hamster<00:01:36.170> if<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.650> if<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.159> just

like looking up on YouTube they are

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.580 
like looking up on YouTube they are
incredibly<00:01:43.829> crazy<00:01:44.579> i<00:01:44.820> will<00:01:45.119> tell<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.420> that

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
they dart like around I think every

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.889 
they dart like around I think every
robot<00:01:49.740> I've<00:01:49.979> ever<00:01:50.130> seen<00:01:50.399> they're<00:01:50.850> just<00:01:50.899> very

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
robot I've ever seen they're just very

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.310 
robot I've ever seen they're just very
active<00:01:52.530> have<00:01:53.100> have<00:01:54.030> lots<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.689> lots<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.170> lots

active have have lots and lots and lots

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.179 
active have have lots and lots and lots
of<00:01:55.680> energy<00:01:57.409> so<00:01:58.409> i<00:01:58.439> probably<00:01:58.890> wouldn't

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
of energy so i probably wouldn't

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.310 
of energy so i probably wouldn't
recommend<00:01:59.549> that<00:01:59.640> for<00:02:00.180> when<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:00.899> seems<00:02:01.140> like

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
recommend that for when it seems like

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.649
