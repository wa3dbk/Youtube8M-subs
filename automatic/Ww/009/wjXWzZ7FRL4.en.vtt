 this time I'm coming to bring you the mold 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.880
 item frame or what are we going to do 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.260
 is to bring you what would be the framework of 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.350
 items but good 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.960
 I thank the codeco gamer I think so 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.520
 it is called for having passed me the modem 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.200
 thank you very much minutes for passing me the 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.210
 mod if I do not remember your good name 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.650
 you well know who I'm naming and 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.510
 well nothing how can we have what 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.070
 that would be the frame of items totally 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.470
 functional this way I brought what 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.210
 It would be about three weeks ago I think and 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.130
 well basically we did not have the 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.390
 possibility of putting the items but with 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.240
 this way yes we can 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.770
 let's see the catches the craft of the item 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.770
 in front of the craft item frame with 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.300
 that would be 8 sticks and one of leather and 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.070
 good once you have everything that 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.110
 you have it in what would be your hand 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.330
 basically today to kraft you are not going to 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.130
 to be able to place it in what would be your 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.869
 surroundings of minecraft you simply go 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.369
 to put it in what would be a space like that 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.470
 As we can see, you can place it in 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.850
 any part and well the only thing that 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.220
 you can place in what will be the item 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.900
 frame would be the blocks because with the 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.070
 tools you can not and nothing what 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.869
 you have to be to place it would be 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.610
 touch it in what would be the frame item 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.500
 as we can see there we put it 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.330
 putting block by block and good the 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.920
 mod it made me very epic because it serves 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.289
 basically for what would be 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.119
 decoration since I do not know if at 0.12 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:53.220
 point zero go to add this item 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.080
 but the truth for decoration and what 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.729
 it would be a way that does not require texture 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.920
 guys as well as they hear it is 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.229
 basically for nothing great and the in 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.610
 download will be in the description 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.350
 it's just a point js like we can 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.820

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.590
