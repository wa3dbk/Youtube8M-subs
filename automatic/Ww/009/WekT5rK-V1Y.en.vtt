view feature on the EOS 50d now now this

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.740 
view feature on the EOS 50d now now this
is<00:00:20.700> a<00:00:20.730> really<00:00:20.910> great<00:00:21.180> feature<00:00:21.360> because<00:00:21.600> you

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
is a really great feature because you

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.090 
is a really great feature because you
can<00:00:21.930> look<00:00:22.080> directly<00:00:22.350> through<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.800> back<00:00:22.950> of

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
can look directly through the back of

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.560 
can look directly through the back of
the<00:00:23.189> camera<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.790> that's<00:00:24.240> really

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
the camera and that's really

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.690 
the camera and that's really
advantageous<00:00:25.080> when<00:00:25.380> you're<00:00:25.529> taking<00:00:25.800> shots<00:00:25.860> on

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:26.700 
advantageous when you're taking shots on

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.580 
advantageous when you're taking shots on
very<00:00:27.360> low<00:00:27.600> angle<00:00:27.779> say<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.170> would<00:00:28.320> needed<00:00:28.529> to

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
very low angle say you would needed to

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.839 
very low angle say you would needed to
lay<00:00:28.740> on<00:00:28.860> the<00:00:28.950> ground<00:00:29.099> well<00:00:29.369> you<00:00:29.460> don't<00:00:29.550> need<00:00:29.730> to

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
lay on the ground well you don't need to

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.070 
lay on the ground well you don't need to
do<00:00:29.939> that<00:00:30.090> anymore<00:00:30.210> because<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.750> can<00:00:30.900> see

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
do that anymore because you can see

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.119 
do that anymore because you can see
through<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.350> back<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.680> camera<00:00:31.830> or

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:32.129 
through the back of the camera or

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:34.070 
through the back of the camera or
ultimate<00:00:32.940> high<00:00:33.150> angle<00:00:33.510> shots<00:00:33.750> where<00:00:33.960> you're

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:34.080 
ultimate high angle shots where you're

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.240 
ultimate high angle shots where you're
holding<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.379> over<00:00:34.530> your<00:00:34.650> head<00:00:34.830> and<00:00:34.949> looking

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
holding it over your head and looking

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.189 
holding it over your head and looking
down<00:00:35.280> like<00:00:35.610> this<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.330> that<00:00:36.480> really<00:00:36.780> makes<00:00:37.050> it

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:37.199 
down like this so that really makes it

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:38.450 
down like this so that really makes it
convenient<00:00:37.470> to<00:00:37.710> do<00:00:37.800> those<00:00:37.920> shots<00:00:38.129> because<00:00:38.250> you

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
convenient to do those shots because you

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.380 
convenient to do those shots because you
don't<00:00:38.610> have<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.940> look<00:00:39.090> through<00:00:39.270> the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
don't have to look through the

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.549 
don't have to look through the
viewfinder<00:00:39.629> in<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.050> back<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.379> camera

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.900 
viewfinder in the back of the camera
sort<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.129> something<00:00:41.400> that's<00:00:41.489> been<00:00:41.640> brought

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
sort of something that's been brought

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.299 
sort of something that's been brought
over<00:00:41.940> from<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.629> point-and-shoot<00:00:43.410> series<00:00:43.770> but

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
over from the point-and-shoot series but

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.280 
over from the point-and-shoot series but
is<00:00:44.430> much<00:00:44.580> more<00:00:44.760> difficult<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.420> do<00:00:45.600> with<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.840> DSLR

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
is much more difficult to do with a DSLR

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.049 
is much more difficult to do with a DSLR
so<00:00:46.650> on<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.830> back<00:00:46.949> of<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.159> camera<00:00:47.370> let's<00:00:47.940> take

the image that you're taking and I've

architectural shots you want

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.190 
architectural shots you want
have<00:02:24.159> this<00:02:24.370> grid<00:02:24.670> put<00:02:24.939> in<00:02:25.120> front<00:02:25.480> so<00:02:26.019> you<00:02:26.140> can

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
have this grid put in front so you can

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.869 
have this grid put in front so you can
really<00:02:26.620> tell<00:02:26.799> that<00:02:26.830> the<00:02:27.189> cameras<00:02:27.519> level<00:02:27.819> I'm

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
silent mode over here this is let's hit

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:33.330 
silent mode over here this is let's hit
the<00:02:32.170> set<00:02:32.349> button<00:02:32.530> we<00:02:32.650> see<00:02:32.799> that<00:02:32.890> we<00:02:32.980> have<00:02:33.129> two

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
the set button we see that we have two

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.460 
the set button we see that we have two
different<00:02:33.579> ways<00:02:34.120> to<00:02:34.420> shoot<00:02:34.569> silently<00:02:35.110> the

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
different ways to shoot silently the

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.130 
different ways to shoot silently the
first<00:02:35.739> one<00:02:35.920> is<00:02:36.220> will<00:02:37.030> actually<00:02:37.540> enable<00:02:37.810> you<00:02:38.110> to

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
first one is will actually enable you to

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.440 
first one is will actually enable you to
press<00:02:38.799> the<00:02:39.010> shutter<00:02:39.579> button<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:40.239> take

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
press the shutter button and take

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.110 
press the shutter button and take
multiple<00:02:41.440> images<00:02:41.980> it's<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.549> default<00:02:42.849> mode

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
multiple images it's the default mode

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.479 
multiple images it's the default mode
over<00:02:43.329> here<00:02:43.599> MOTU<00:02:43.989> is<00:02:44.440> a<00:02:44.500> little<00:02:44.860> bit<00:02:44.980> quieter

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
over here MOTU is a little bit quieter

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.030 
over here MOTU is a little bit quieter
but<00:02:46.000> it<00:02:46.120> only<00:02:46.239> allows<00:02:46.629> you<00:02:46.840> to<00:02:47.079> take<00:02:47.379> a<00:02:47.560> single

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
but it only allows you to take a single

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.069 
but it only allows you to take a single
image<00:02:48.370> so<00:02:49.209> you're<00:02:49.569> going<00:02:49.720> to<00:02:49.780> find<00:02:49.959> out<00:02:50.019> that

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
image so you're going to find out that

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:51.720 
image so you're going to find out that
that<00:02:50.260> operates<00:02:50.709> slightly<00:02:51.190> differently<00:02:51.549> when

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
that operates slightly differently when

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.130 
that operates slightly differently when
you<00:02:51.790> hold<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.150> shutter<00:02:52.480> halfway<00:02:52.900> down<00:02:53.079> it

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
you hold the shutter halfway down it

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.479 
you hold the shutter halfway down it
takes<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.680> picture<00:02:53.829> when<00:02:54.159> you<00:02:54.250> follow

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
takes the picture when you follow

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.220 
takes the picture when you follow
through<00:02:54.640> and<00:02:54.790> then<00:02:55.120> it<00:02:55.239> disables<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.930> camera

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
through and then it disables the camera

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.229 
through and then it disables the camera
for<00:02:56.409> a<00:02:56.440> moment<00:02:56.799> so<00:02:57.280> it's<00:02:57.640> gonna<00:02:57.790> let<00:02:57.940> up<00:02:58.000> being

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
for a moment so it's gonna let up being

00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:59.640 
for a moment so it's gonna let up being
a<00:02:58.269> little<00:02:58.390> bit<00:02:58.510> quieter<00:02:59.079> than<00:02:59.200> mode<00:02:59.349> one<00:02:59.500> but

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
a little bit quieter than mode one but

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.559 
a little bit quieter than mode one but
it<00:02:59.920> does<00:03:00.099> not<00:03:00.220> allow<00:03:00.430> you<00:03:00.459> to<00:03:00.579> take<00:03:00.819> continuous

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
it does not allow you to take continuous

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:02.910 
it does not allow you to take continuous
images<00:03:01.959> and<00:03:02.049> then<00:03:02.139> of<00:03:02.260> course<00:03:02.290> you<00:03:02.769> can

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
images and then of course you can

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.319 
images and then of course you can
