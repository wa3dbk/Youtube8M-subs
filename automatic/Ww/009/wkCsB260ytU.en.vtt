yeah<00:03:13.680> this<00:03:13.950> is<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.400> 20<00:03:15.109> 23<00:03:16.109> inch<00:03:16.349> I<00:03:16.470> believe<00:03:16.799> oh

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
yeah this is the 20 23 inch I believe oh

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.900 
yeah this is the 20 23 inch I believe oh
it<00:03:19.200> is<00:03:19.440> pretty<00:03:19.769> thin<00:03:20.010> i<00:03:20.040> love<00:03:20.370> how<00:03:20.519> thin<00:03:20.760> it<00:03:20.880> is

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
it is pretty thin i love how thin it is

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.960 
it is pretty thin i love how thin it is
and<00:03:21.329> it<00:03:21.989> seems<00:03:22.440> like<00:03:22.560> it's<00:03:22.859> very<00:03:23.040> fragile<00:03:23.430> but

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
and it seems like it's very fragile but

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.539 
and it seems like it's very fragile but
i'll<00:03:24.810> try<00:03:25.049> to<00:03:25.139> work<00:03:25.380> with<00:03:25.410> it<00:03:25.739> has<00:03:25.950> a<00:03:26.069> camera<00:03:26.280> on

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
i'll try to work with it has a camera on

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.030 
i'll try to work with it has a camera on
the<00:03:26.669> front<00:03:26.849> so<00:03:27.239> you<00:03:27.269> can<00:03:27.389> facetime<00:03:28.040> but

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
the front so you can facetime but

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.080 
the front so you can facetime but
overall<00:03:29.400> pretty<00:03:29.660> definitely<00:03:31.400> this<00:03:32.400> enables

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
overall pretty definitely this enables

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.030 
overall pretty definitely this enables
me<00:03:33.269> to<00:03:33.299> go<00:03:33.599> ahead<00:03:33.870> and<00:03:34.019> put<00:03:34.349> out<00:03:34.470> a<00:03:34.500> lot<00:03:34.829> more
