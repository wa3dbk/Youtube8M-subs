that very blank and neutrals we're going
to<00:02:23.120> that's<00:02:23.450> what<00:02:23.690> really<00:02:24.020> makes<00:02:24.260> this<00:02:24.500> look

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
to that's what really makes this look

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.940 
to that's what really makes this look
different<00:02:25.490> and<00:02:25.970> very<00:02:26.270> defined<00:02:26.810> so<00:02:27.800> you're

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
different and very defined so you're

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:37.150 
different and very defined so you're
pushing<00:02:28.400> out<00:02:28.580> and<00:02:30.250> up<00:02:31.250> not<00:02:32.030> down<00:02:35.710> I'm<00:02:36.710> just

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
pushing out and up not down I'm just

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.770 
pushing out and up not down I'm just
smoking<00:02:37.610> this<00:02:37.730> out<00:02:37.970> a<00:02:38.000> little<00:02:38.270> bit<00:02:38.450> because<00:02:38.600> I

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
smoking this out a little bit because I

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.520 
smoking this out a little bit because I
don't<00:02:39.080> like<00:02:39.290> it<00:02:39.500> as<00:02:39.670> sharp<00:02:40.670> as<00:02:41.110> a<00:02:42.110> lot<00:02:42.410> of

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
don't like it as sharp as a lot of

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.670 
don't like it as sharp as a lot of
tutorials<00:02:42.710> do<00:02:43.370> I<00:02:43.990> want<00:02:44.990> it<00:02:45.080> to<00:02:45.110> still<00:02:45.470> have<00:02:45.650> a
