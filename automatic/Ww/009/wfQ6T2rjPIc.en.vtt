00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.600 
return pass so I believe we're on step 6
we're<00:02:33.540> gonna<00:02:33.630> yarn<00:02:33.990> over<00:02:34.350> and<00:02:34.530> draw<00:02:34.620> through

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
we're gonna yarn over and draw through

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.710 
we're gonna yarn over and draw through
that<00:02:36.330> first<00:02:36.660> loop<00:02:37.670> then<00:02:38.670> for<00:02:38.910> step<00:02:39.210> seven<00:02:39.660> we

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
that first loop then for step seven we

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.320 
that first loop then for step seven we
run<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.930> yarn<00:02:40.170> over<00:02:40.350> and<00:02:40.530> draw<00:02:40.740> through<00:02:41.400> two

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
run the yarn over and draw through two

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.160 
run the yarn over and draw through two
loops<00:02:42.600> at<00:02:42.930> once<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:44.310> we're<00:02:44.460> going<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:45.170> repeat

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
loops at once so we're going to repeat

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.520 
loops at once so we're going to repeat
step<00:02:46.590> seven<00:02:47.130> all<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:48.270> way<00:02:48.390> across<00:02:48.690> until<00:02:49.170> the

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
end of the return pass and then we can

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.590 
end of the return pass and then we can
start<00:02:53.400> all<00:02:53.820> over<00:02:53.880> again<00:02:55.490> repeating<00:02:56.490> steps<00:02:56.940> one

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
start all over again repeating steps one

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.260 
start all over again repeating steps one
