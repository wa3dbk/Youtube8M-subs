into today is creating that canvas
drawing<00:00:09.030> to<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.179> canvas<00:00:09.690> talked<00:00:10.290> about<00:00:10.590> this

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800

holder thing a little bit and then we'll

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.350 
holder thing a little bit and then we'll
probably<00:00:14.009> like<00:00:14.400> one<00:00:14.700> maybe<00:00:14.969> two<00:00:15.330> more

overview first thing that we're going to

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.779 
overview first thing that we're going to
do<00:00:28.050> is<00:00:28.170> we're<00:00:28.289> going<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.439> utilize<00:00:28.890> this<00:00:29.279> holder

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
do is we're going to utilize this holder

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.460 
do is we're going to utilize this holder
to<00:00:30.000> make<00:00:30.029> sure<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.539> we<00:00:30.689> can<00:00:30.840> actually<00:00:31.019> draw

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
to make sure that we can actually draw

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.799 
to make sure that we can actually draw
to<00:00:31.529> our<00:00:31.740> canvas<00:00:32.250> make<00:00:32.820> sure<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.120> surface<00:00:33.390> is

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
to our canvas make sure the surface is

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.870 
to our canvas make sure the surface is
valid<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.860> what<00:00:35.070> we're<00:00:35.190> going<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.340> do<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.730> is

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
valid and what we're going to do that is

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.030 
valid and what we're going to do that is
within<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.329> run<00:00:36.570> method<00:00:36.809> we're<00:00:37.469> going<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.620> again

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
within a run method we're going to again

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.100 
within a run method we're going to again
do<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.370> within<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.570> know<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:39.930> if

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
do that within this you know this if

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.220 
do that within this you know this if
statement<00:00:40.680> if<00:00:40.829> our<00:00:41.610> thread<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.120> okay<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.510> be<00:00:42.780> to

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
statement if our thread is okay to be to

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.010 
statement if our thread is okay to be to
run<00:00:43.469> basically<00:00:44.040> if<00:00:44.370> it's<00:00:44.520> running<00:00:44.870> then<00:00:45.870> we're

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
run basically if it's running then we're

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.900 
run basically if it's running then we're
going<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.200> check<00:00:46.649> if<00:00:46.920> our<00:00:47.190> holder<00:00:47.760> is

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
going to check if our holder is

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.690 
going to check if our holder is
available<00:00:48.450> or<00:00:48.629> basically<00:00:49.530> if<00:00:49.710> our<00:00:49.829> surface<00:00:50.250> is

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
available or basically if our surface is

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.970 
available or basically if our surface is
available<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:51.510> we<00:00:51.600> can<00:00:51.629> draw<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.770> if<00:00:52.860> it

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
available so we can draw to it and if it

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.319 
available so we can draw to it and if it
is<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.370> we're<00:00:53.489> going<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.699> create<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.059> canvas

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
is and we're going to create a canvas

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.959 
is and we're going to create a canvas
and<00:00:54.660> draw<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:54.989> canvas<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.680> actually<00:00:56.460> a

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
and draw to that canvas and actually a

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.900 
and draw to that canvas and actually a
good<00:00:57.329> thing<00:00:57.390> we<00:00:58.460> good<00:00:59.460> thing<00:00:59.640> you<00:00:59.730> guys

good thing we good thing you guys
watching<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.420> tutorial<00:01:00.629> because<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:01.350> was

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
watching this tutorial because this was

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.770 
watching this tutorial because this was
supposed<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:01.920> be<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.070> while<00:01:02.430> loop<00:01:02.850> I'm<00:01:03.390> sorry

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
supposed to be a while loop I'm sorry

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.830 
supposed to be a while loop I'm sorry
not<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:03.989> if<00:01:04.650> statement<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:05.760> as<00:01:06.150> long<00:01:06.420> as<00:01:06.479> it's

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
not a if statement so as long as it's

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.780 
not a if statement so as long as it's
our<00:01:07.110> thread<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.590> running<00:01:07.920> as<00:01:08.340> long<00:01:08.369> as<00:01:08.670> that

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
our thread is running as long as that

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.760 
our thread is running as long as that
variable<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.659> building<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.260> valuable

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
variable that building and valuable

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.250 
variable that building and valuable
variable<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.820> set<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.689> true<00:01:12.900> we're<00:01:13.080> going<00:01:13.200> to

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
variable is set to true we're going to

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.929 
variable is set to true we're going to
do<00:01:13.409> this<00:01:13.560> while<00:01:13.799> loop<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.670> kind<00:01:14.880> of

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
do this while loop so this is kind of

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.090 
do this while loop so this is kind of
like<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.210> invalidate<00:01:15.900> we<00:01:16.439> called<00:01:16.950> that

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
like the invalidate we called that

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.520 
like the invalidate we called that
invalidate<00:01:17.729> method<00:01:18.200> that<00:01:19.200> would<00:01:19.350> just

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
invalidate method that would just

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.550 
invalidate method that would just
basically<00:01:19.920> cause<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.119> loop<00:01:21.420> through<00:01:21.689> this

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
basically cause it to loop through this

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.929 
basically cause it to loop through this
time<00:01:22.740> we're<00:01:22.890> actually<00:01:23.009> creating<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.670> while

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
time we're actually creating a while

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.850 
time we're actually creating a while
loop<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.479> as<00:01:24.600> long<00:01:24.720> as<00:01:24.780> our<00:01:25.020> thread<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.530> you

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
loop so as long as our thread is you

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.850 
loop so as long as our thread is you
know<00:01:26.369> running<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.210> it's<00:01:27.630> okay<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.049> run<00:01:28.320> we're

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
know running and it's okay to run we're

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.560 
know running and it's okay to run we're
going<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.250> know<00:01:29.400> create<00:01:29.970> all<00:01:30.210> our<00:01:30.360> stuff

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
going to you know create all our stuff

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.569 
going to you know create all our stuff
within<00:01:30.780> here<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.950> now<00:01:32.070> we're<00:01:32.189> going<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.340> set

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
within here and now we're going to set

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.880 
within here and now we're going to set
up<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.790> if<00:01:33.000> statement<00:01:33.570> yeah<00:01:34.049> it's<00:01:34.229> an<00:01:34.350> actual<00:01:34.650> if

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
up a if statement yeah it's an actual if

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.499 
up a if statement yeah it's an actual if
statement<00:01:35.340> this<00:01:35.400> time<00:01:35.520> I'm<00:01:35.909> not<00:01:36.060> messing<00:01:36.390> up

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
statement this time I'm not messing up

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.569 
statement this time I'm not messing up
here<00:01:36.780> but<00:01:36.990> we're<00:01:37.829> going<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.009> do<00:01:38.159> within<00:01:38.340> this

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
here but we're going to do within this

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.969 
here but we're going to do within this
if<00:01:38.759> statement<00:01:38.909> it's<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.479> holder<00:01:39.960> we're<00:01:40.860> going

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
if statement it's a holder we're going

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.899 
if statement it's a holder we're going
to<00:01:41.070> say<00:01:41.189> dot<00:01:41.490> get<00:01:42.329> surface<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.700> then<00:01:44.700> we're

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
to say dot get surface and then we're

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.539 
to say dot get surface and then we're
just<00:01:44.939> going<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.210> say<00:01:45.450> dot<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:46.369> valid<00:01:47.369> so

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
just going to say dot is valid so

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.910 
just going to say dot is valid so
basically<00:01:48.180> it's<00:01:48.360> like<00:01:48.450> hey<00:01:48.720> if<00:01:48.930> our<00:01:49.530> surface

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
basically it's like hey if our surface

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.010 
basically it's like hey if our surface
is<00:01:50.130> valid<00:01:50.520> that's<00:01:50.880> cool<00:01:51.210> but<00:01:51.479> we're<00:01:51.899> actually

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
is valid that's cool but we're actually

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.539 
is valid that's cool but we're actually
going<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.439> do<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.680> we're<00:01:52.829> just<00:01:52.860> going<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.130> put

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
going to do is we're just going to put

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.350 
going to do is we're just going to put
an<00:01:53.640> exclamation<00:01:54.060> mark<00:01:54.600> right<00:01:55.439> bolt<00:01:55.740> before

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
an exclamation mark right bolt before

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.359 
an exclamation mark right bolt before
you<00:01:57.360> know<00:01:57.479> this<00:01:57.600> whole<00:01:57.810> method<00:01:58.170> here<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:59.219> what

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
you know this whole method here and what

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.490 
you know this whole method here and what
that<00:01:59.490> saying<00:01:59.790> is<00:02:00.000> basically<00:02:00.899> if<00:02:01.020> it's<00:02:01.200> not

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
that saying is basically if it's not

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.740 
that saying is basically if it's not
valid<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.189> all<00:02:02.939> we're<00:02:03.060> going<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.210> do<00:02:03.450> is<00:02:03.600> we're

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
valid and all we're going to do is we're

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.110 
valid and all we're going to do is we're
going<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.899> say<00:02:05.780> oops

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:08.120 
going to say oops

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.400 
going to say oops
you<00:02:09.120> don't<00:02:09.240> really<00:02:09.330> have<00:02:09.570> to<00:02:09.750> create<00:02:09.900> brackets

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
you don't really have to create brackets

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.590 
you don't really have to create brackets
but<00:02:10.620> I'm<00:02:10.830> just<00:02:11.040> going<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.370> but<00:02:12.360> what<00:02:12.510> we're

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
but I'm just going to but what we're

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.400 
but I'm just going to but what we're
going<00:02:12.630> to<00:02:12.840> do<00:02:12.930> is<00:02:13.020> we're<00:02:13.140> going<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.290> say

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
going to do is we're going to say

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.000 
going to do is we're going to say
continue<00:02:14.100> and<00:02:15.260> what<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.350> continuum<00:02:16.890> method

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
continue and what the continuum method

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.590 
continue and what the continuum method
does<00:02:18.590> if<00:02:19.590> you<00:02:19.710> spell<00:02:20.010> it<00:02:20.160> right<00:02:20.360> what's<00:02:21.360> going

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
does if you spell it right what's going

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.660 
does if you spell it right what's going
to<00:02:21.630> do<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:22.080> basically<00:02:22.710> if<00:02:23.010> we<00:02:23.100> write<00:02:23.340> anything

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
to do is basically if we write anything

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.750 
to do is basically if we write anything
down<00:02:23.940> here<00:02:24.890> it's<00:02:25.890> going<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.160> skip<00:02:26.460> over<00:02:26.640> that

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
down here it's going to skip over that

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.730 
down here it's going to skip over that
it's<00:02:27.090> just<00:02:27.300> going<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.450> be<00:02:27.540> like<00:02:27.660> hey<00:02:27.960> you<00:02:28.650> know

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
it's just going to be like hey you know

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.920 
it's just going to be like hey you know
the<00:02:28.860> surface<00:02:29.280> is<00:02:29.460> not<00:02:29.700> valid<00:02:30.210> so<00:02:30.390> we're<00:02:30.840> going

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
the surface is not valid so we're going

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.110 
the surface is not valid so we're going
to<00:02:31.020> continue<00:02:31.620> so<00:02:31.770> it's<00:02:31.920> going<00:02:32.070> to<00:02:32.160> call<00:02:32.430> back

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
to continue so it's going to call back

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.570 
to continue so it's going to call back
up<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.690> top<00:02:33.930> up<00:02:34.170> here<00:02:34.200> loop<00:02:35.010> through<00:02:35.250> again

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
up to the top up here loop through again

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.030 
up to the top up here loop through again
if<00:02:36.390> it's<00:02:36.630> still<00:02:36.840> not<00:02:36.960> available<00:02:37.470> it's<00:02:37.620> again

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
if it's still not available it's again

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.620 
if it's still not available it's again
just<00:02:38.250> going<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.430> kind<00:02:38.640> of<00:02:38.670> loop<00:02:38.910> through<00:02:39.150> here

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
just going to kind of loop through here

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.390 
just going to kind of loop through here
it's<00:02:40.170> never<00:02:40.380> going<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:40.620> reach<00:02:40.800> this<00:02:40.950> code<00:02:41.190> down

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
it's never going to reach this code down

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.750 
it's never going to reach this code down
here<00:02:41.510> but<00:02:42.510> if<00:02:42.750> if<00:02:43.140> this<00:02:43.770> statement<00:02:44.070> returns<00:02:44.340> a

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
here but if if this statement returns a

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.800 
here but if if this statement returns a
false<00:02:45.060> value<00:02:45.570> which<00:02:46.350> means<00:02:46.620> our<00:02:46.950> surface<00:02:47.580> is

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
false value which means our surface is

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.020 
false value which means our surface is
available<00:02:48.810> it's<00:02:49.440> going<00:02:49.710> to<00:02:49.770> skip<00:02:50.130> you<00:02:50.910> know

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
available it's going to skip you know

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.820 
available it's going to skip you know
this<00:02:51.210> whole<00:02:51.390> if<00:02:51.570> statement<00:02:51.990> because<00:02:52.380> you<00:02:52.680> know

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
this whole if statement because you know

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.950 
this whole if statement because you know
if<00:02:53.400> our<00:02:53.490> surface<00:02:53.910> is<00:02:54.090> available<00:02:54.660> it's<00:02:54.780> not

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
if our surface is available it's not

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.720 
if our surface is available it's not
even<00:02:55.200> going<00:02:55.350> to<00:02:55.410> call<00:02:55.650> this<00:02:55.830> continue<00:02:56.370> method

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
even going to call this continue method

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.280 
even going to call this continue method
so<00:02:57.180> that's<00:02:57.390> going<00:02:57.540> to<00:02:57.600> allow<00:02:57.840> us<00:02:58.020> to<00:02:58.050> access

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
so that's going to allow us to access

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.340 
so that's going to allow us to access
this<00:02:58.770> code<00:02:59.010> down<00:02:59.190> here<00:02:59.250> and<00:03:00.120> this<00:03:01.050> is<00:03:01.200> where

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
this code down here and this is where

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.260 
this code down here and this is where
we're<00:03:01.500> going<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:01.680> create<00:03:01.920> our<00:03:01.980> canvas<00:03:02.550> so<00:03:03.150> what

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
we're going to create our canvas so what

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.670 
we're going to create our canvas so what
we<00:03:03.330> need<00:03:03.480> to<00:03:03.510> do<00:03:03.750> is<00:03:03.870> we<00:03:04.020> need<00:03:04.170> to<00:03:04.260> set<00:03:04.440> up<00:03:04.590> a

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
we need to do is we need to set up a

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.380 
we need to do is we need to set up a
canvas<00:03:05.130> we're<00:03:05.700> just<00:03:05.850> going<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.060> call<00:03:06.210> this

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
canvas we're just going to call this

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.150 
canvas we're just going to call this
canvas<00:03:06.660> C<00:03:07.140> we're<00:03:07.440> going<00:03:07.590> to<00:03:07.650> set<00:03:07.830> this<00:03:07.950> equal

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
canvas C we're going to set this equal

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.060 
canvas C we're going to set this equal
to<00:03:08.550> our<00:03:08.730> holder<00:03:09.090> again<00:03:10.010> dot<00:03:11.010> lock<00:03:11.610> canvas<00:03:12.480> and

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
to our holder again dot lock canvas and

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.580 
to our holder again dot lock canvas and
basically<00:03:14.070> the<00:03:14.280> way<00:03:14.400> that<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.730> canvas<00:03:15.000> works

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
basically the way that the canvas works

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.470 
basically the way that the canvas works
within<00:03:16.590> a<00:03:16.830> thread<00:03:17.160> or<00:03:17.580> what<00:03:17.820> we're<00:03:17.970> doing<00:03:18.180> here

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
within a thread or what we're doing here

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.870 
within a thread or what we're doing here
within<00:03:19.260> a<00:03:19.350> surface<00:03:19.709> view<00:03:19.920> is<00:03:20.160> we<00:03:20.370> need<00:03:20.520> to<00:03:20.640> lock

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
within a surface view is we need to lock

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.270 
within a surface view is we need to lock
the<00:03:21.090> canvas<00:03:21.540> and<00:03:21.780> then<00:03:22.320> paint<00:03:22.650> to<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.250> canvas

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
the canvas and then paint to the canvas

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.540 
the canvas and then paint to the canvas
and<00:03:23.850> then<00:03:24.120> unlock<00:03:24.660> it<00:03:24.870> and<00:03:25.020> display<00:03:25.440> so<00:03:26.130> you

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
and then unlock it and display so you

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
to do is we're just going to say canvas

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.000 
to do is we're just going to say canvas
and<00:03:51.630> let's<00:03:51.780> set<00:03:51.930> up<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.170> background<00:03:52.680> color<00:03:52.920> so

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
we're just going to say draw and we have

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.340 
we're just going to say draw and we have
this<00:03:56.130> a<00:03:56.600> our<00:03:58.489> GB<00:03:59.489> value<00:04:00.360> so<00:04:00.600> a<00:04:00.630> is<00:04:00.870> for<00:04:01.170> alpha

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
this a our GB value so a is for alpha

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.690 
this a our GB value so a is for alpha
and<00:04:01.830> these<00:04:02.459> are<00:04:02.580> all<00:04:02.700> n<00:04:02.850> values<00:04:03.480> 0<00:04:04.140> to<00:04:04.230> 255<00:04:05.220> is

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
and these are all n values 0 to 255 is

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.790 
and these are all n values 0 to 255 is
the<00:04:05.820> highest<00:04:06.150> that<00:04:06.300> you<00:04:06.360> can<00:04:06.510> go<00:04:06.690> so<00:04:07.350> for<00:04:07.620> alpha

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
red value let's put that at like

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.380 
red value let's put that at like
150<00:04:20.750> our<00:04:21.260> green<00:04:21.680> value<00:04:22.100> let's<00:04:22.310> do<00:04:22.460> 150<00:04:22.880> our

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
150 our green value let's do 150 our

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.900 
150 our green value let's do 150 our
blue<00:04:23.690> value<00:04:24.140> will<00:04:24.380> do<00:04:24.530> like<00:04:24.710> 10<00:04:25.100> I<00:04:25.340> don't<00:04:25.850> know

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
blue value will do like 10 I don't know

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.340 
blue value will do like 10 I don't know
you<00:04:26.030> guys<00:04:26.210> can<00:04:26.420> mess<00:04:26.570> around<00:04:26.600> with<00:04:26.930> the<00:04:27.020> colors

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
you guys can mess around with the colors

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.350 
you guys can mess around with the colors
those<00:04:28.040> are<00:04:28.070> just<00:04:28.310> the<00:04:28.490> values<00:04:28.610> of<00:04:29.030> the<00:04:29.150> red

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
those are just the values of the red

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.400 
those are just the values of the red
green<00:04:30.020> and<00:04:30.140> blue<00:04:30.620> so<00:04:31.780> again<00:04:32.780> you<00:04:32.900> can<00:04:33.050> go<00:04:33.170> up<00:04:33.260> to

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
green and blue so again you can go up to

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.100 
green and blue so again you can go up to
255<00:04:33.950> there<00:04:34.460> as<00:04:34.610> well<00:04:34.790> so<00:04:35.600> basically<00:04:35.720> that's

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
255 there as well so basically that's

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.570 
255 there as well so basically that's
just<00:04:36.290> going<00:04:36.380> to<00:04:36.440> paint<00:04:36.740> our<00:04:36.860> background<00:04:37.340> of

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
just going to paint our background of

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.460 
just going to paint our background of
the<00:04:37.910> canvas<00:04:38.300> and<00:04:38.480> then<00:04:38.720> what<00:04:38.900> we<00:04:39.020> do<00:04:39.170> is<00:04:39.290> we

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
the canvas and then what we do is we

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.950 
the canvas and then what we do is we
relate<00:04:40.430> to<00:04:40.460> or<00:04:40.670> holder<00:04:41.030> again<00:04:41.330> and<00:04:41.570> we<00:04:41.780> just

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
relate to or holder again and we just

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:48.100 
relate to or holder again and we just
say<00:04:42.110> dot<00:04:43.810> unlock<00:04:44.810> canvas<00:04:45.320> and<00:04:45.560> post<00:04:46.960> then<00:04:47.960> we

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
say dot unlock canvas and post then we

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.590 
say dot unlock canvas and post then we
post<00:04:48.380> which<00:04:48.620> canvas<00:04:49.040> we<00:04:49.190> want<00:04:49.430> and<00:04:50.210> again<00:04:50.330> we

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
post which canvas we want and again we

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.690 
post which canvas we want and again we
call<00:04:50.780> this<00:04:50.960> canvas<00:04:51.230> C<00:04:51.620> so<00:04:51.920> that's<00:04:52.070> the<00:04:52.340> canvas

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
call this canvas C so that's the canvas

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.550 
call this canvas C so that's the canvas
we're<00:04:52.850> unlocking<00:04:53.450> and<00:04:53.660> posting<00:04:54.140> to<00:04:54.170> the<00:04:54.350> world

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
we're unlocking and posting to the world

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.040 
we're unlocking and posting to the world
and<00:04:54.830> as<00:04:55.280> long<00:04:55.520> as<00:04:55.550> again<00:04:56.180> this<00:04:56.390> variable<00:04:56.960> is

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
and as long as again this variable is

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.930 
and as long as again this variable is
set<00:04:57.260> to<00:04:57.380> true<00:04:57.620> it's<00:04:58.310> just<00:04:58.400> going<00:04:58.640> to<00:04:58.760> keep

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
set to true it's just going to keep

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.820 
set to true it's just going to keep
circling<00:04:59.420> through<00:04:59.960> it's<00:05:00.140> going<00:05:00.320> to<00:05:00.380> basically

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
circling through it's going to basically

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.040 
circling through it's going to basically
be<00:05:00.980> like<00:05:01.310> again<00:05:01.700> our<00:05:01.820> invalidate<00:05:02.540> method<00:05:02.900> that

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
be like again our invalidate method that

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.530 
be like again our invalidate method that
we<00:05:03.140> use<00:05:03.320> but<00:05:04.190> now<00:05:04.460> it's<00:05:04.640> just<00:05:04.700> in<00:05:04.940> a<00:05:05.030> while<00:05:05.240> loop

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.540 
we use but now it's just in a while loop

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.270 
we use but now it's just in a while loop
that's<00:05:05.750> going<00:05:06.080> as<00:05:06.260> long<00:05:06.500> as<00:05:06.680> our<00:05:06.800> thread<00:05:07.130> is

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
that's going as long as our thread is

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.540 
that's going as long as our thread is
set<00:05:07.490> to<00:05:07.610> true<00:05:07.790> I<00:05:08.230> hope<00:05:09.230> that<00:05:09.440> makes<00:05:09.620> sense

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
set to true I hope that makes sense

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.650 
set to true I hope that makes sense
but<00:05:10.850> we're<00:05:11.000> going<00:05:11.180> to<00:05:11.240> do<00:05:11.420> now<00:05:11.720> is<00:05:13.570> you<00:05:14.570> know

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
but we're going to do now is you know

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.510 
but we're going to do now is you know
because<00:05:15.050> this<00:05:15.230> is<00:05:15.410> just<00:05:15.710> kind<00:05:15.890> of<00:05:15.950> boring<00:05:16.250> we

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
because this is just kind of boring we

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.550 
because this is just kind of boring we
want<00:05:16.700> to<00:05:16.760> draw<00:05:16.910> that<00:05:17.060> bitmap<00:05:17.360> and<00:05:17.870> we<00:05:18.410> also

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
want to draw that bitmap and we also

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.010 
want to draw that bitmap and we also
maybe<00:05:18.890> want<00:05:19.220> to<00:05:19.280> touch<00:05:19.580> the<00:05:20.000> screen<00:05:20.360> touch<00:05:20.780> the

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
maybe want to touch the screen touch the

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.200 
maybe want to touch the screen touch the
canvas<00:05:21.260> and<00:05:21.650> allow<00:05:21.920> our<00:05:22.310> activity<00:05:22.940> to<00:05:23.090> do

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
canvas and allow our activity to do

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.030 
canvas and allow our activity to do
something<00:05:23.600> that<00:05:23.810> way<00:05:23.990> so<00:05:24.620> what<00:05:24.860> we're<00:05:24.950> going

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 
something that way so what we're going

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.670 
something that way so what we're going
to<00:05:25.100> do<00:05:25.280> is<00:05:25.400> we're<00:05:25.520> going<00:05:25.550> to<00:05:25.670> go<00:05:25.850> up<00:05:26.060> to<00:05:26.300> our<00:05:26.680> on

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
to do is we're going to go up to our on

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.950 
to do is we're going to go up to our on
create<00:05:28.490> method<00:05:28.700> and<00:05:29.450> we<00:05:29.510> probably<00:05:29.690> won't<00:05:29.840> have

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
create method and we probably won't have

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.800 
create method and we probably won't have
time<00:05:30.230> to<00:05:30.980> do<00:05:31.100> this<00:05:31.280> all<00:05:31.970> this<00:05:32.240> stuff<00:05:32.480> in<00:05:32.630> this

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
time to do this all this stuff in this

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.840 
time to do this all this stuff in this
tutorial<00:05:32.990> but<00:05:33.950> what<00:05:34.130> we're<00:05:34.280> going<00:05:34.310> to<00:05:34.490> do<00:05:34.700> is

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:34.850 
tutorial but what we're going to do is

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.270 
tutorial but what we're going to do is
we're<00:05:34.970> going<00:05:35.000> to<00:05:35.150> say<00:05:35.420> our<00:05:35.660> view<00:05:36.530> and<00:05:37.100> we're

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
we're going to say our view and we're

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.500 
we're going to say our view and we're
going<00:05:37.400> to<00:05:37.460> say<00:05:37.640> dot<00:05:37.940> set<00:05:38.660> on<00:05:39.400> touch<00:05:40.510> listener

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
going to say dot set on touch listener

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.600 
going to say dot set on touch listener
kind<00:05:42.260> of<00:05:42.320> like<00:05:42.440> the<00:05:42.560> on<00:05:42.680> click<00:05:42.980> listener<00:05:43.370> that

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
kind of like the on click listener that

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.400 
kind of like the on click listener that
we've<00:05:43.910> done<00:05:44.060> previously<00:05:44.720> with<00:05:44.840> the<00:05:45.110> buttons

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410 
we've done previously with the buttons

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.320 
we've done previously with the buttons
and<00:05:45.620> stuff<00:05:45.860> we're<00:05:46.400> going<00:05:46.490> to<00:05:46.550> say<00:05:46.730> this<00:05:47.000> and

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
and stuff we're going to say this and

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.210 
and stuff we're going to say this and
we're<00:05:47.510> going<00:05:47.630> to<00:05:47.660> allow<00:05:47.870> our<00:05:48.200> class<00:05:48.950> to

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.220 
we're going to allow our class to

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.870 
we're going to allow our class to
implement<00:05:50.410> the<00:05:51.410> on<00:05:51.500> touch<00:05:51.770> listener<00:05:52.250> which

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
implement the on touch listener which

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.810 
implement the on touch listener which
appears<00:05:53.360> right<00:05:53.540> here<00:05:53.980> so<00:05:54.980> that's<00:05:55.370> basically

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.820 
appears right here so that's basically

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.090 
appears right here so that's basically
what<00:05:56.030> this<00:05:56.330> is<00:05:56.390> referring<00:05:56.750> to<00:05:57.050> which<00:05:57.560> listener

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:58.100 
what this is referring to which listener

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.980 
what this is referring to which listener
you<00:05:58.940> know<00:05:59.090> the<00:05:59.210> listener<00:05:59.660> that<00:05:59.690> we're

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
you know the listener that we're

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.750 
you know the listener that we're
implementing<00:06:00.440> and<00:06:00.710> then<00:06:01.250> we're<00:06:01.430> going<00:06:01.550> to<00:06:01.580> go

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760 
implementing and then we're going to go

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.250 
implementing and then we're going to go
over<00:06:01.940> to<00:06:02.030> our<00:06:02.060> surface<00:06:02.510> view<00:06:02.720> here<00:06:02.990> and<00:06:03.110> add

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:03.260 
over to our surface view here and add

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.610 
over to our surface view here and add
the<00:06:03.500> unimplemented<00:06:03.920> methods<00:06:04.220> and<00:06:05.500> if<00:06:06.500> we

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
the unimplemented methods and if we

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.110 
the unimplemented methods and if we
scroll<00:06:06.860> down<00:06:06.920> to<00:06:07.190> the<00:06:07.310> bottom<00:06:07.460> we<00:06:07.760> have<00:06:07.940> this

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 
scroll down to the bottom we have this

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.870 
scroll down to the bottom we have this
on<00:06:08.330> touch<00:06:08.690> method<00:06:09.110> which<00:06:09.710> will<00:06:09.950> get<00:06:10.100> it<00:06:10.220> get

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 
on touch method which will get it get

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.900 
on touch method which will get it get
into<00:06:11.180> in<00:06:11.480> the<00:06:11.660> next<00:06:11.960> tutorial<00:06:12.500> but<00:06:13.460> basically

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:13.910 
into in the next tutorial but basically

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.000 
into in the next tutorial but basically
just<00:06:14.000> change<00:06:14.540> these<00:06:15.020> variable<00:06:15.590> names<00:06:15.800> from

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.010 
just change these variable names from

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.320 
just change these variable names from
args<00:06:16.520> 0<00:06:16.790> to<00:06:17.510> V<00:06:18.020> for<00:06:18.470> view<00:06:18.860> and<00:06:19.070> our<00:06:19.760> and<00:06:20.000> our

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.330 
args 0 to V for view and our and our

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:25.700 
args 0 to V for view and our and our
motion<00:06:20.750> event<00:06:21.020> from<00:06:21.320> Arg<00:06:21.620> 1<00:06:21.920> to<00:06:23.200> MA<00:06:24.200> me<00:06:24.920> motion

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 
motion event from Arg 1 to MA me motion

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.860 
motion event from Arg 1 to MA me motion
that
