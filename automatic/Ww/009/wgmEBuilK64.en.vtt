order to be where we want to be at a

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:07.850 
order to be where we want to be at a
championship<00:03:07.170> level<00:03:07.290> we<00:03:07.470> got<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:07.650> run<00:03:07.739> the

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
championship level we got to run the

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.050 
championship level we got to run the
ball<00:03:08.010> better<00:03:08.190> and<00:03:08.459> we've<00:03:08.549> got<00:03:08.700> to<00:03:08.790> be<00:03:08.880> able<00:03:08.910> to

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
play better defense and I think that

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.840 
play better defense and I think that
right<00:03:10.709> what<00:03:10.890> you're<00:03:11.040> seeing<00:03:11.220> now<00:03:11.340> is<00:03:11.730> the
