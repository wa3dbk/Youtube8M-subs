this<00:03:00.489> soil<00:03:01.450> in<00:03:02.110> Palestine<00:03:02.739> and<00:03:02.769> the<00:03:02.890> soil<00:03:03.250> that

this soil in Palestine and the soil that

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.610 
this soil in Palestine and the soil that
part<00:03:03.880> becomes<00:03:04.209> a<00:03:04.569> part<00:03:05.170> of<00:03:05.200> the<00:03:05.319> world<00:03:05.500> I

part becomes a part of the world I

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.910 
part becomes a part of the world I
should<00:03:05.799> say<00:03:05.980> this<00:03:06.489> house<00:03:06.790> mainly<00:03:07.269> Israel<00:03:07.860> is<00:03:08.860> a

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
should say this house mainly Israel is a

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.080 
should say this house mainly Israel is a
dry<00:03:09.370> soil<00:03:09.790> she<00:03:10.690> preserved<00:03:11.140> thing<00:03:11.620> yes<00:03:12.280> and<00:03:12.549> I

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
dry soil she preserved thing yes and I

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.979 
dry soil she preserved thing yes and I
am<00:03:13.780> certain<00:03:14.530> I<00:03:15.120> would<00:03:16.120> probably<00:03:16.299> be<00:03:16.600> playing<00:03:16.750> a

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
am certain I would probably be playing a

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.780 
am certain I would probably be playing a
harp<00:03:17.200> I'm<00:03:17.440> very<00:03:17.739> hopeful<00:03:18.100> about<00:03:18.160> that<00:03:18.340> part<00:03:18.730> of

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
harp I'm very hopeful about that part of

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.720 
harp I'm very hopeful about that part of
my<00:03:18.940> life<00:03:18.970> but<00:03:19.840> I<00:03:19.900> will<00:03:20.200> be<00:03:20.350> there<00:03:20.560> at<00:03:20.920> 76<00:03:21.519> I

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
my life but I will be there at 76 I

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.170 
my life but I will be there at 76 I
think<00:03:22.060> that<00:03:22.269> in<00:03:22.480> time<00:03:23.160> that<00:03:24.160> land<00:03:24.519> is<00:03:24.760> going<00:03:24.940> to

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
think that in time that land is going to

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
think that in time that land is going to
yield<00:03:25.450> ancient<00:03:26.440> manuscripts
