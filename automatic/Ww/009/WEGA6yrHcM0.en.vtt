00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:01.610 

so<00:00:00.510> what<00:00:00.659> is<00:00:00.780> it<00:00:00.900> that<00:00:00.989> sets<00:00:01.230> full-frame

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
so what is it that sets full-frame

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.430 
so what is it that sets full-frame
cameras<00:00:02.010> and<00:00:02.250> crop<00:00:02.669> cameras<00:00:03.030> apart<00:00:03.440> let's

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
cameras and crop cameras apart let's

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:16.640 
cameras and crop cameras apart let's
find<00:00:04.650> out<00:00:14.089> all<00:00:15.089> right<00:00:15.269> so<00:00:15.839> what<00:00:16.289> is<00:00:16.320> the

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
find out all right so what is the

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.920 
find out all right so what is the
difference<00:00:17.010> between<00:00:17.270> full-frame<00:00:18.270> sensors

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
difference between full-frame sensors

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.010 
difference between full-frame sensors
and<00:00:19.260> crop<00:00:19.770> sensors<00:00:20.189> now<00:00:20.820> simply<00:00:21.210> put<00:00:21.420> the

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
and crop sensors now simply put the

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.140 
and crop sensors now simply put the
short<00:00:22.289> answer<00:00:22.590> is<00:00:22.619> full-frame<00:00:23.460> sensors<00:00:23.910> are

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
short answer is full-frame sensors are

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.599 
short answer is full-frame sensors are
bigger<00:00:24.510> than<00:00:24.900> crop<00:00:25.170> sensors<00:00:25.650> now<00:00:25.980> for<00:00:26.250> Canon

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
bigger than crop sensors now for Canon

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.390 
bigger than crop sensors now for Canon
that's<00:00:26.990> 1.6<00:00:27.990> times<00:00:28.140> bigger<00:00:28.470> for<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:28.980> Nikon

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
that's 1.6 times bigger for a Nikon

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.510 
that's 1.6 times bigger for a Nikon
that's<00:00:29.699> 1.5<00:00:30.660> times<00:00:31.050> bigger<00:00:31.439> so<00:00:32.009> simply<00:00:32.399> by

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
that's 1.5 times bigger so simply by

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.580 
that's 1.5 times bigger so simply by
looking<00:00:32.730> at<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.180> can<00:00:33.210> already<00:00:33.480> tell<00:00:33.870> the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
looking at it you can already tell the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.770 
looking at it you can already tell the
full-frame<00:00:35.070> sensor<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.790> significantly

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
full-frame sensor is significantly

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.290 
full-frame sensor is significantly
bigger<00:00:37.110> than<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.920> crop<00:00:38.219> sensor<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:38.910> is

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
bigger than the crop sensor so that is

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.819 
bigger than the crop sensor so that is
the<00:00:39.450> main<00:00:39.600> difference<00:00:39.960> between<00:00:40.020> full-frame

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
the main difference between full-frame

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.709 
the main difference between full-frame
and<00:00:41.040> crop<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:42.030> thank<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.390> everyone<00:00:42.629> for

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
and crop so thank you everyone for

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.569 
and crop so thank you everyone for
watching<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.530> just<00:00:43.559> joking<00:00:44.070> we're<00:00:44.219> not<00:00:44.340> done

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
watching I just joking we're not done

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.910 
watching I just joking we're not done
yet<00:00:44.820> there's<00:00:45.000> more<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.890> next

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
yet there's more to it so the next

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.130 
yet there's more to it so the next
factor<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:48.120> differentiates<00:00:48.660> full-frame

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
factor that differentiates full-frame

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.650 
factor that differentiates full-frame
and<00:00:49.320> crop<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:50.160> field<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.550> view<00:00:50.879> hence<00:00:51.449> why

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
and crop is the field of view hence why

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.930 
and crop is the field of view hence why
they<00:00:51.809> say<00:00:51.960> crop<00:00:52.260> because<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:53.039> crop<00:00:53.460> sensor<00:00:53.610> is

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
they say crop because a crop sensor is

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.420 
they say crop because a crop sensor is
basically<00:00:54.449> like<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.020> crop<00:00:55.350> down<00:00:55.559> version<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.129> a

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
basically like a crop down version of a

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.540 
basically like a crop down version of a
full-frame<00:00:56.969> sensor<00:00:57.960> now<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.620> image<00:00:59.190> circle

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
full-frame sensor now the image circle

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.709 
full-frame sensor now the image circle
that<00:00:59.640> comes<00:00:59.879> out<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.030> your<00:01:00.210> lens<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.510> image

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
that comes out of your lens the image

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.280 
that comes out of your lens the image
that<00:01:00.809> comes<00:01:00.930> out<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.710> lens<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.910> same

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
that comes out of a lens is the same

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.630 
that comes out of a lens is the same
except<00:01:04.290> with<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.680> crop<00:01:04.920> sensor<00:01:05.309> you're<00:01:05.430> only

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
except with the crop sensor you're only

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.620 
except with the crop sensor you're only
just<00:01:05.970> taking<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:07.200> middle<00:01:08.130> section<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
just taking the middle section of the

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.899 
just taking the middle section of the
image<00:01:09.810> whereas<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.439> crop<00:01:10.830> sensor<00:01:11.010> sorry

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
image whereas a crop sensor sorry

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.609 
image whereas a crop sensor sorry
whereas<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.330> full<00:01:12.600> frame<00:01:12.750> sensor<00:01:12.810> takes<00:01:13.380> up

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
whereas a full frame sensor takes up

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.340 
whereas a full frame sensor takes up
more<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.909> image<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.390> see<00:01:15.689> more<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.080> the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
more of the image so you see more of the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.050 
more of the image so you see more of the
image<00:01:16.950> with<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.810> full-frame<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.430> you<00:01:20.430> see<00:01:20.700> less

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
image with a full-frame and you see less

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.910 
image with a full-frame and you see less
of<00:01:21.330> them<00:01:21.509> it's<00:01:21.689> just<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.049> center<00:01:22.470> bit<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.799> the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
of them it's just the center bit of the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.310 
of them it's just the center bit of the
image<00:01:23.220> with<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.790> crop<00:01:24.150> sensor<00:01:24.360> now<00:01:25.110> another

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
image with a crop sensor now another

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.440 
image with a crop sensor now another
factor<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.979> sets<00:01:26.250> apart<00:01:26.400> full-frame<00:01:27.210> and

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
factor that sets apart full-frame and

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.740 
factor that sets apart full-frame and
crop<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.799> field<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.159> view<00:01:29.430> otherwise<00:01:30.329> crop

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
crop is the field of view otherwise crop

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.179 
crop is the field of view otherwise crop
factor<00:01:30.930> that's<00:01:31.380> why<00:01:31.619> it's<00:01:31.770> called<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:32.009> crop

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
factor that's why it's called a crop

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.890 
factor that's why it's called a crop
sensor<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.729> crop<00:01:32.880> sensor<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.240> based<00:01:33.420> on<00:01:33.630> crop

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
sensor and crop sensor is based on crop

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.069 
sensor and crop sensor is based on crop
down<00:01:34.079> version<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:35.460> full-frame<00:01:36.270> sensor<00:01:36.869> so

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
down version of a full-frame sensor so

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.870 
down version of a full-frame sensor so
that<00:01:37.229> has<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.409> direct<00:01:37.770> impact<00:01:38.130> on<00:01:38.280> your<00:01:38.610> field

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
that has a direct impact on your field

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.749 
that has a direct impact on your field
of<00:01:39.000> view<00:01:39.270> imagine<00:01:39.840> taking<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.470> photo<00:01:41.159> taken

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
of view imagine taking a photo taken

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.060 
of view imagine taking a photo taken
from<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.270> full-frame<00:01:42.960> camera<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.619> then

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
from a full-frame camera and then

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.679 
from a full-frame camera and then
cropping<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.549> down<00:01:44.759> in<00:01:44.939> Photoshop<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.630> you

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
cropping it down in Photoshop and you

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.870 
cropping it down in Photoshop and you
pretty<00:01:46.140> much<00:01:46.229> get<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:47.100> same<00:01:47.340> effect<00:01:47.670> as<00:01:47.790> a

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
pretty much get the same effect as a

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.179 
pretty much get the same effect as a
crop<00:01:48.509> sensor<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:49.380> if<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.619> crop<00:01:49.799> sensor<00:01:49.950> camera

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
crop sensor so if a crop sensor camera

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.920 
crop sensor so if a crop sensor camera
you<00:01:50.640> will<00:01:50.820> get<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.240> tighter

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
you will get a tighter

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.539 
you will get a tighter
field<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.439> view<00:01:52.619> because<00:01:52.829> you're<00:01:53.220> cropping

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
field of view because you're cropping

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.550 
field of view because you're cropping
down<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.119> image<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.659> just<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.020> center<00:01:55.320> so

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
down the image to just the center so

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.289 
down the image to just the center so
your<00:01:55.950> image<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.310> going<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.549> be<00:01:56.700> much<00:01:56.939> tighter

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
your image is going to be much tighter

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.660 
your image is going to be much tighter
whereas<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.810> full-frame<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.680> get<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.219> wider

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
whereas the full-frame you get a wider

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.359 
whereas the full-frame you get a wider

Nikon users so fifty millimeters by 1.6

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.380 
Nikon users so fifty millimeters by 1.6
that's<00:02:20.080> 80<00:02:20.380> mm<00:02:20.920> so<00:02:21.370> that<00:02:21.400> means<00:02:21.760> using<00:02:21.940> a<00:02:22.090> 50

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
that's 80 mm so that means using a 50

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.570 
that's 80 mm so that means using a 50
millimeter<00:02:22.600> lens<00:02:22.840> on<00:02:23.230> a<00:02:23.500> crop<00:02:23.890> body<00:02:24.100> will<00:02:24.400> give

a Canon 5d Mark 3 which has a full-frame

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.530 
a Canon 5d Mark 3 which has a full-frame
sensor<00:02:39.010> so<00:02:39.610> this<00:02:39.820> is<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.060> field<00:02:40.240> of<00:02:40.360> view<00:02:40.450> you

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
sensor so this is the field of view you

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.980 
sensor so this is the field of view you
get<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:41.050> here<00:02:41.650> is<00:02:41.830> the<00:02:42.280> exact<00:02:42.970> same<00:02:43.540> setup

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
get and here is the exact same setup

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.290 
get and here is the exact same setup
except<00:02:44.680> this<00:02:44.980> time<00:02:45.220> we're<00:02:45.430> taking<00:02:45.550> it<00:02:45.850> with<00:02:46.120> a

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
except this time we're taking it with a

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.460 
except this time we're taking it with a
70<00:02:46.870> d<00:02:47.080> which<00:02:47.650> has<00:02:47.950> a<00:02:48.250> crop<00:02:48.730> factor<00:02:48.910> of<00:02:49.350> 1.6<00:02:50.350> you

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
70 d which has a crop factor of 1.6 you

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.490 
70 d which has a crop factor of 1.6 you
can<00:02:50.590> see<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:51.010> field<00:02:51.280> of<00:02:51.400> view<00:02:51.670> is<00:02:51.960> tighter<00:02:52.960> but

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
can see the field of view is tighter but

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.190 
can see the field of view is tighter but
we're<00:02:53.680> using<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.070> exact<00:02:54.490> same<00:02:54.520> lens<00:02:55.210> so<00:02:55.930> it's

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
we're using the exact same lens so it's

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.860 
we're using the exact same lens so it's
the<00:02:56.560> same<00:02:56.830> 50<00:02:57.310> millimeter<00:02:57.700> lens<00:02:57.760> however<00:02:58.720> you

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
the same 50 millimeter lens however you

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.960 
the same 50 millimeter lens however you
can<00:02:59.020> see<00:02:59.260> it's<00:02:59.500> basically<00:02:59.890> like<00:03:00.460> a<00:03:00.520> cropped

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
can see it's basically like a cropped

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.390 
can see it's basically like a cropped
down<00:03:01.210> version<00:03:01.660> of<00:03:01.780> the<00:03:02.260> full-frame<00:03:02.740> so<00:03:03.190> like<00:03:03.370> I

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
down version of the full-frame so like I

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.340 
down version of the full-frame so like I
said<00:03:03.640> just<00:03:03.670> now<00:03:03.880> if<00:03:04.090> I<00:03:04.180> were<00:03:04.360> to<00:03:04.540> use<00:03:04.570> a<00:03:04.750> 50

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
said just now if I were to use a 50

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.890 
said just now if I were to use a 50
millimeter<00:03:05.860> lens<00:03:06.040> on<00:03:06.400> a<00:03:06.670> crop<00:03:06.970> sensor<00:03:07.150> that

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
millimeter lens on a crop sensor that

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.570 
millimeter lens on a crop sensor that
would<00:03:08.080> give<00:03:08.260> me<00:03:08.410> the<00:03:08.530> equivalent<00:03:08.920> field<00:03:09.430> of

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
would give me the equivalent field of

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.210 
would give me the equivalent field of
view<00:03:09.820> as<00:03:10.000> using<00:03:10.330> an<00:03:10.450> 80<00:03:10.900> millimeter<00:03:11.530> lens<00:03:11.710> on<00:03:11.890> a

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
view as using an 80 millimeter lens on a

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.000 
view as using an 80 millimeter lens on a
full-frame<00:03:13.120> so<00:03:13.660> if<00:03:13.780> I<00:03:13.870> take<00:03:14.080> a<00:03:14.110> shot<00:03:14.350> using<00:03:14.740> 80

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
full-frame so if I take a shot using 80

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.220 
full-frame so if I take a shot using 80
mm<00:03:15.610> on<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:16.120> 5d<00:03:16.480> Mark<00:03:16.510> 3<00:03:16.750> which<00:03:17.050> is<00:03:17.200> a

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
mm on the 5d Mark 3 which is a

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.350 
mm on the 5d Mark 3 which is a
full-frame<00:03:17.800> you<00:03:18.130> can<00:03:18.280> see<00:03:18.610> that<00:03:18.910> would<00:03:19.090> give

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
full-frame you can see that would give

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.390 
full-frame you can see that would give
me<00:03:19.390> approximately<00:03:20.020> the<00:03:20.560> same<00:03:20.830> field<00:03:21.190> of<00:03:21.340> view

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
me approximately the same field of view

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.990 
me approximately the same field of view
as<00:03:21.880> the<00:03:22.020> 50mm<00:03:23.020> on<00:03:23.170> the<00:03:23.470> crop<00:03:23.830> now<00:03:24.520> full-frame

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
as the 50mm on the crop now full-frame

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.690 
as the 50mm on the crop now full-frame
cameras<00:03:25.390> also<00:03:25.900> have<00:03:26.260> an<00:03:26.440> edge<00:03:26.830> over<00:03:27.040> crop

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
cameras also have an edge over crop

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.520 
cameras also have an edge over crop
sensor<00:03:28.209> cameras<00:03:28.690> when<00:03:28.959> it<00:03:29.080> comes<00:03:29.320> to

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
sensor cameras when it comes to

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.370 
sensor cameras when it comes to
low-light<00:03:30.010> performance<00:03:30.330> now<00:03:31.330> because<00:03:31.720> if<00:03:31.959> the

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
low-light performance now because if the

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.590 
low-light performance now because if the
megapixel<00:03:33.160> count<00:03:33.310> is<00:03:33.580> pretty<00:03:34.030> much<00:03:34.150> constant

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
megapixel count is pretty much constant

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.440 
megapixel count is pretty much constant
around<00:03:34.900> the<00:03:35.110> range<00:03:35.320> of<00:03:35.620> 20<00:03:36.040> megapixels<00:03:36.700> with

around the range of 20 megapixels with
the<00:03:37.630> full-frame<00:03:38.230> sensor<00:03:38.680> being<00:03:38.980> bigger

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
the full-frame sensor being bigger

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.880 
the full-frame sensor being bigger
that<00:03:39.880> means<00:03:40.120> each<00:03:40.360> individual<00:03:41.200> pixel<00:03:41.380> will

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
that means each individual pixel will

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.280 
that means each individual pixel will
also<00:03:42.250> get<00:03:42.489> to<00:03:42.610> be<00:03:42.730> bigger<00:03:43.030> whereas<00:03:43.930> with<00:03:44.170> a

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
also get to be bigger whereas with a

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.080 
also get to be bigger whereas with a
crop<00:03:44.590> sensor<00:03:44.950> camera<00:03:44.980> you<00:03:45.310> have<00:03:45.430> to<00:03:45.520> cram<00:03:45.880> all

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
crop sensor camera you have to cram all

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.990 
crop sensor camera you have to cram all
those<00:03:46.360> pixels<00:03:46.750> into<00:03:47.170> a<00:03:47.200> smaller<00:03:47.709> area<00:03:47.920> so<00:03:48.760> each

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
those pixels into a smaller area so each

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.210 
those pixels into a smaller area so each
pixel<00:03:49.690> size<00:03:49.870> is<00:03:50.140> going<00:03:50.350> to<00:03:50.440> be<00:03:50.620> smaller<00:03:51.100> so

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
pixel size is going to be smaller so

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.010 
pixel size is going to be smaller so
with<00:03:51.610> bigger<00:03:51.880> pixel<00:03:52.300> sizes<00:03:52.780> on<00:03:52.900> the

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
with bigger pixel sizes on the

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.750 
with bigger pixel sizes on the
full-frame<00:03:53.440> they<00:03:53.739> are<00:03:53.830> able<00:03:53.980> to<00:03:54.160> receive

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
full-frame they are able to receive

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.880 
full-frame they are able to receive
light<00:03:55.270> better<00:03:55.480> and<00:03:55.780> generate<00:03:56.200> less<00:03:56.530> of<00:03:56.739> that

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
light better and generate less of that

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.750 
light better and generate less of that
digital<00:03:57.310> noise<00:03:57.550> we<00:03:57.850> all<00:03:58.060> dread<00:03:58.630> at<00:03:59.170> high<00:03:59.530> ISOs

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
digital noise we all dread at high ISOs

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.479 
digital noise we all dread at high ISOs
so<00:04:01.120> generally<00:04:01.600> with<00:04:01.959> a<00:04:02.200> crop<00:04:03.130> sensor<00:04:03.459> camera

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
so generally with a crop sensor camera

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.060 
so generally with a crop sensor camera
you<00:04:03.970> will<00:04:04.120> get<00:04:04.330> much<00:04:04.570> noisier<00:04:05.050> images<00:04:05.560> at<00:04:05.739> high

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
you will get much noisier images at high

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.270 
you will get much noisier images at high
ISO<00:04:06.340> s<00:04:06.760> and<00:04:07.060> with<00:04:07.870> a<00:04:08.050> full-frame<00:04:08.620> camera<00:04:09.010> you

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
ISO s and with a full-frame camera you

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.750 
ISO s and with a full-frame camera you
will<00:04:09.430> get<00:04:09.670> less<00:04:10.300> noisy<00:04:10.720> images<00:04:11.110> at<00:04:11.320> high<00:04:11.860> ISO<00:04:12.160> s

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
will get less noisy images at high ISO s

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.850 
will get less noisy images at high ISO s
as<00:04:12.970> you<00:04:13.120> can<00:04:13.269> see<00:04:13.510> in<00:04:13.720> the<00:04:13.989> sample<00:04:14.170> photos<00:04:14.650> I'm

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
as you can see in the sample photos I'm

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.099 
as you can see in the sample photos I'm
showing<00:04:15.280> you<00:04:15.310> so<00:04:16.180> that<00:04:16.390> is<00:04:16.540> pretty<00:04:16.690> much<00:04:16.900> it

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
showing you so that is pretty much it

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.289 
showing you so that is pretty much it
about<00:04:17.320> full-frame<00:04:18.040> vs.<00:04:18.519> crop<00:04:18.820> if<00:04:19.030> you<00:04:19.120> think

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
about full-frame vs. crop if you think

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:20.370 
about full-frame vs. crop if you think
there's<00:04:19.450> something<00:04:19.720> that<00:04:19.750> I<00:04:19.900> missed

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
there's something that I missed

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.960 
there's something that I missed
do<00:04:20.680> point<00:04:20.950> it<00:04:21.039> out<00:04:21.100> to<00:04:21.160> me<00:04:21.310> in<00:04:21.580> the<00:04:21.669> comment

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
do point it out to me in the comment
