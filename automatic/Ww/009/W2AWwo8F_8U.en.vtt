the<00:01:20.560> next<00:01:20.590> problem<00:01:21.009> i<00:01:21.250> had<00:01:21.520> was<00:01:21.820> when<00:01:21.880> i<00:01:22.450> would

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
the next problem i had was when i would

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.109 
the next problem i had was when i would
accept<00:01:23.259> the<00:01:23.380> license<00:01:23.800> agreement<00:01:23.920> and<00:01:24.429> it

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
accept the license agreement and it

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.080 
accept the license agreement and it
would<00:01:25.300> launch<00:01:25.479> the<00:01:25.929> launcher<00:01:26.410> I<00:01:26.729> was<00:01:27.729> getting

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
would launch the launcher I was getting

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.260 
would launch the launcher I was getting
fatal<00:01:29.020> errors<00:01:29.380> cret<00:01:29.830> and<00:01:30.069> crashed<00:01:30.610> every<00:01:31.030> time

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
the future or possibly could be and if

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.540 
the future or possibly could be and if
you<00:02:20.410> delete<00:02:20.709> it<00:02:20.739> it<00:02:20.980> could<00:02:21.129> cause<00:02:21.310> problems

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
you delete it it could cause problems

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.000 
you delete it it could cause problems
down<00:02:21.879> the<00:02:22.209> road<00:02:22.239> so<00:02:23.110> make<00:02:23.410> sure<00:02:23.440> that<00:02:23.650> you

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
down the road so make sure that you

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.399 
down the road so make sure that you
don't<00:02:24.220> delete<00:02:24.610> it<00:02:24.760> just<00:02:25.239> rename<00:02:25.629> it<00:02:25.780> and<00:02:25.900> this

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 
don't delete it just rename it and this

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:28.740 
don't delete it just rename it and this
should<00:02:26.709> hopefully<00:02:26.920> solve<00:02:27.430> your<00:02:27.670> problem<00:02:28.030> if
