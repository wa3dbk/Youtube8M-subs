00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
very nice screen protectors I used to

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.560 
very nice screen protectors I used to
have<00:00:29.259> one<00:00:29.529> on<00:00:29.800> my<00:00:30.160> 3ds<00:00:30.869> but<00:00:31.869> I<00:00:33.300> decided<00:00:34.300> to<00:00:34.420> take

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
have one on my 3ds but I decided to take

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.880 
have one on my 3ds but I decided to take
that<00:00:34.750> off<00:00:34.930> and<00:00:34.960> go<00:00:35.230> with<00:00:35.350> the<00:00:35.379> invisible

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
that off and go with the invisible

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.290 
that off and go with the invisible
shield<00:00:36.720> for<00:00:37.720> I<00:00:38.020> was<00:00:38.860> playing<00:00:39.160> on<00:00:39.400> doing<00:00:40.180> the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
shield for I was playing on doing the

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.009 
shield for I was playing on doing the
same<00:00:40.480> thing<00:00:40.780> with<00:00:40.960> the<00:00:40.989> Vita<00:00:41.370> but<00:00:42.809> because<00:00:43.809> it

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:44.019 
same thing with the Vita but because it

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:47.430 
same thing with the Vita but because it
has<00:00:44.199> the<00:00:44.440> touch<00:00:44.680> screen<00:00:44.860> and<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.989> rear

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
has the touch screen and the rear

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.819 
has the touch screen and the rear
touchpad<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:49.450> feel<00:00:49.750> of<00:00:49.780> the<00:00:50.230> invisible

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
touchpad the feel of the invisible

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.400 
touchpad the feel of the invisible
shield<00:00:51.040> is<00:00:51.460> not<00:00:52.450> quite<00:00:52.719> as<00:00:52.780> smooth<00:00:53.200> as

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
shield is not quite as smooth as

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.310 
shield is not quite as smooth as
actually<00:00:53.890> more<00:00:54.879> has<00:00:55.239> more<00:00:55.570> of<00:00:55.629> a<00:00:55.690> sticky<00:00:56.110> feel

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
actually more has more of a sticky feel

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.729 
actually more has more of a sticky feel
to<00:00:56.590> it<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:58.000> I<00:00:58.059> decided<00:00:58.450> to<00:00:58.629> opt<00:00:58.870> out<00:00:59.170> on<00:00:59.410> it<00:00:59.559> and

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
to it so I decided to opt out on it and

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:06.980 
to it so I decided to opt out on it and
just<00:00:59.770> go<00:01:00.399> with<00:01:00.640> the<00:01:00.670> whorey<00:01:01.300> version<00:01:02.850> but<00:01:03.850> uh

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.900 

but<00:01:07.990> yeah<00:01:08.200> from<00:01:08.440> what<00:01:08.470> I<00:01:08.649> understand<00:01:09.399> here's

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:09.910 
but yeah from what I understand here's

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:16.320 
but yeah from what I understand here's
pretty<00:01:10.509> much<00:01:10.690> must<00:01:10.960> be<00:01:11.080> the<00:01:11.259> same

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.070 

on<00:01:16.870> here<00:01:17.470> so<00:01:17.950> just<00:01:18.220> a<00:01:18.610> bear<00:01:18.910> bear<00:01:19.660> with<00:01:19.840> me<00:01:20.050> on

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
on here so just a bear bear with me on

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.010 
on here so just a bear bear with me on
here<00:01:20.620> let's<00:01:21.250> see<00:01:21.570> now<00:01:22.570> what's<00:01:22.810> nice<00:01:22.960> about

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
here let's see now what's nice about

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
here let's see now what's nice about
this<00:01:23.290> is<00:01:23.890> all<00:01:24.220> the<00:01:24.460> blue<00:01:24.700> area<00:01:25.440> John<00:01:26.440> I<00:01:26.770> think

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
this is all the blue area John I think

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.670 
this is all the blue area John I think
I'm<00:01:27.430> having<00:01:28.000> this<00:01:28.090> in<00:01:28.240> the<00:01:28.300> shot<00:01:28.560> but<00:01:29.560> as

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
I'm having this in the shot but as

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.320 
I'm having this in the shot but as
covers<00:01:30.040> more<00:01:30.250> than<00:01:30.310> just<00:01:30.640> a<00:01:30.700> screen<00:01:30.970> actually

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
covers more than just a screen actually

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.080 
covers more than just a screen actually
covers<00:01:31.750> most<00:01:32.230> of<00:01:32.410> the<00:01:33.010> shiny<00:01:33.340> part<00:01:33.460> on<00:01:33.910> the

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
covers most of the shiny part on the

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.680 
covers most of the shiny part on the
front<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:36.100> it<00:01:36.490> will<00:01:36.640> wrap<00:01:36.850> around<00:01:36.880> the<00:01:37.300> analog

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
front so it will wrap around the analog

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:43.260 
front so it will wrap around the analog
stick<00:01:37.720> d-pad<00:01:38.410> things<00:01:38.680> like<00:01:38.860> that<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.970> it<00:01:43.090> looks

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
stick d-pad things like that so it looks

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.810 
stick d-pad things like that so it looks
like<00:01:43.360> I<00:01:43.510> start<00:01:43.960> from<00:01:44.170> the<00:01:44.290> top<00:01:44.620> of<00:01:45.070> the<00:01:45.370> system

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
like I start from the top of the system

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.020 
like I start from the top of the system
so<00:01:46.120> it's<00:01:46.270> gonna<00:01:46.360> go<00:01:46.540> like<00:01:46.570> this<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.850> yeah<00:01:49.000> I

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
so it's gonna go like this so yeah I

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.950 
so it's gonna go like this so yeah I
start<00:01:49.330> from<00:01:49.450> the<00:01:49.570> top<00:01:49.780> and<00:01:49.840> work<00:01:50.140> my<00:01:50.470> way<00:01:50.650> down

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
start from the top and work my way down

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.600 
start from the top and work my way down
but<00:01:52.960> um<00:01:54.570> yeah<00:01:55.950> pretty<00:01:56.950> much<00:01:57.040> took<00:01:57.400> this

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
but um yeah pretty much took this

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:11.199 
but um yeah pretty much took this
straight<00:01:57.940> out<00:01:58.090> of<00:01:58.120> the<00:01:58.240> box

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:23.480 

alright<00:02:12.620> so

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.400 

well<00:02:24.490> I<00:02:24.520> kind<00:02:24.790> of<00:02:24.820> like<00:02:24.970> about<00:02:25.210> this<00:02:25.420> is<00:02:25.660> the

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
well I kind of like about this is the

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.770 
well I kind of like about this is the
fact<00:02:26.440> that<00:02:26.830> these<00:02:27.220> have<00:02:27.520> a<00:02:27.790> little<00:02:28.030> cutouts<00:02:28.510> so

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
fact that these have a little cutouts so

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.040 
fact that these have a little cutouts so
I<00:02:29.590> can<00:02:29.890> go<00:02:30.040> directly<00:02:30.460> over<00:02:30.580> the<00:02:30.820> deep<00:02:31.270> end<00:02:31.510> all

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
I can go directly over the deep end all

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:38.460 
I can go directly over the deep end all
this<00:02:32.500> stuff<00:02:32.740> here<00:02:33.100> and<00:02:36.660> I<00:02:37.660> just<00:02:37.690> wrap<00:02:38.260> this

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
this stuff here and I just wrap this

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.950 
this stuff here and I just wrap this
around<00:02:38.650> and<00:02:42.060> then<00:02:43.060> I<00:02:43.210> should<00:02:43.510> be<00:02:43.540> able<00:02:43.780> to

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
around and then I should be able to

00:02:43.960 --> 00:03:39.790 
around and then I should be able to
start<00:02:44.200> to<00:02:44.620> pull

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:04:02.930 

okay<00:03:40.580> I<00:03:40.610> should

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:26.240 

so

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:46.900
