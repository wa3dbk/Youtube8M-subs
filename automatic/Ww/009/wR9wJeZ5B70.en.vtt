00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.010
 and other events of the week scandal 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.660
 turned into an attempt to our film crew 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.599
 groups drive to transnistria 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.210
 April 19 in the port of Chisinau Moldavian 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.670
 border guards first detained our 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.350
 cameraman and then our 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.050
 Artem special correspondent 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.119
 wide after hours of searching and 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.130
 interrogation they were denied entry into 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.490
 Moldavia under the false pretext of mold 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.529
 they say the purpose of the visit is not clear and it is far from 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.540
 first case with an actual ban on 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.880
 Moldavia weight of film crews of Russia 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.410
 television which is the roughest 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.410
 violation of international obligations 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.570
 Moldova and its signed European 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.640
 conventions it seems that 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.050
 Moldovan authorities deliberately tighten 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.270
 not only economic but also 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.219
 information blockade of transdniestria 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.750
 however, despite the fact that our 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.550
 the crew had to return to 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.960
 Moscow, we still managed to get 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.600
 some videos 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.890
 from transdniestria and thank you for our 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.219
 colleagues in Tiraspol 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.470
 so the question is what is trying 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.750
 hide chisinau from the general public 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.909
 and what lives unrecognized today 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.330
 republic about this in the plot 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:15.030
 artema wide almost four hours 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.310
 interrogation and total inspection of all things 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.860
 Here is a quick trip to 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.320
 moldova we got Moldavian 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.900
 border guards canceled 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.509
 border crossing stamp and also yes you 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.460
 gave us a paper on what true goals are 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.829
 of our stay in the territory of Moldova 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.079
 they are supposedly not and dreams but the reason for 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.430
 really different as soon as ours 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.290
 the operator found a certificate of this 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.329
 center and border guards realized that 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.180
 we are heading exactly to transdniestria 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.159
 we were forced to buy return tickets 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.170
 the plane to Moscow will emphasize our 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.270
 the crew was already the fourth 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.340
 account from Russia which was not allowed in 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.820
 tiraspol about this tough 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.710
 a statement was made by the Russian mid 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.409
 the situation is certainly unacceptable and to 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.479
 Unfortunately, this is not the first time when 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.710
 Russian journalists 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.729
 Moldovan authorities are not allowed on 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.290
 country territory 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.940
 of course we strongly recommended 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:12.510
 silence you have to think about 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.730
 that the negative effect of which is that 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.500
 similar actions may have for 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.630
 prospects for further development 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.340
 Russian-Moldovan relations action 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.810
 Moldovan border guards regarding 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.730
 Journalists from Russia called 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.160
 resentment and in foreign policy 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.990
 Transdniestrian office 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.300
 side regards these restrictive 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.950
 measures as egregious gross violation of rights 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.200
 and freedoms 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.590
 basic democratic principles 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.460
 we will consider such actions as 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.460
 full information blockade 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.170
 attempt to hide the real situation which 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.810
 we have transnistria 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.060
 from the catch to the question arises 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.980
 well as trying to hide Chisinau 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.990
 stubbornly 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.090
 journalists as it turns out important 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.730
 the nervousness of the Moldovan authorities is due to 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.260
 future association with the European Union 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.420
 document signing is scheduled for July 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.310
 but since transdniestria is not promising 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.080
 nothing good tiraspol 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.840
 consistently expanding trading 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.300
 relations with Russia in defiance of the Moldovan 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.460
 authorities therefore chisinau comes up 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.920
 some barrage measures for others 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.709
 sticking a stick in the wheels of transnistrian 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.070
 export businessman 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.200
 our businesses must pass 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:25.250
 Republic of Moldova registration 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.530
 In addition, there are issues with issuing 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.640
 phytosanitary veterinary certificates 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:33.050
 the next stage of our interaction 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.810
 already will directly work on 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.209
 expandability 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.280
 export and inclusion our enterprise 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.440
 program about replacement of russia 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.480
 however, these plans risk staying 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.260
 paper every day to trade with Russia 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.819
 harder 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.130
 because now in the economic blockade 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.319
 transdniestria is actively involved and 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.209
 Ukraine new authorities in Kiev for 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:55.069
 last year almost completely 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.970
 severed ties with transnistrian 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.010
 enterprises 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.680
 from the guarantor of the negotiation process 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.150
 Ukraine has become a guarantor of the blockade 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.040
 transdniestria says president 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.959
 Republic Yevgeny Shevchuk 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.870
 Ukraine reduced the activity of the sentence 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:11.569
 format took a number of people years 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.100
 unfriendly decision one of these is 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:14.299
 restriction of transnistrian movement 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.850
 citizens holding Russian passports 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:18.530
 across the border into the Ukrainian border 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.070
 the second is the restriction of admission and at 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.709
 calculating 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.210
 cargo goods and 3 solutions of this ends 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.729
 times additional forces and means 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.960
 armed formation at the border and 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:27.590
 admit directly from 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.100
 transdniestria 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.550
 for local production it all carries 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.130
 significant damage 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.990
 take at least an electric plant here 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.120
 produce motor transformers and 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.490
 generators for oil and gas and 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.110
 coal industry 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.450
 85 percent of the products shipped to 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.060
 Russia but control all these supplies 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:50.910
 only Chisinau complain at the factory 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.620
 we are forced to use Moldovan 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.990
 transport workers for delivery is like 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.290
 Russian and our transport is blocked 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:00.420
 for deliveries through the Republic of Ukraine 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.100
 so what will happen next whether so 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.140
 that after signing the agreement 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.450
 associations of Moldova with the European Union 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.910
 Moscowâ€™s tiraspol trade relations can 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:11.100
 generally collapse what will turn this for 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.290
 Transnistria's economy speak unnecessarily 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.480
 moldova as if specially trying 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.580
 and undermine the situation in the military 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.170
 plan in late March Chisinau spent 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.320
 indicative military exercises with 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:24.720
 Americans and for the first time since '92 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.310
 foreign troops invaded the zone 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.230
 delimitation between moldavia 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.940
 Transnistria you are far from the landfill 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:32.760
 Bulba to although this is a gross violation 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:35.070
 ceasefire agreements just 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.990
 not far from this means polygon bulbu 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.760
 to is located balaba not 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.370
 what is the distance from the polygon somewhere 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.360
 about two kilometers that's how 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.270
 times within these limits 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.950
 and it means the introduction of the entry in the 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.600
 central part of the security zone 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.220
 here these units are national 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.140
 Republic of Moldova armies and 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.640
 directly to the national guard 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.200
 united states of america such 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.810
 provocative actions cannot dramatically 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.250
 complicate the security zone situation 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.710
 a paradoxical situation 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.780
 while Russia provides security 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:06.240
 transdniestria helps to build a loophole 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.520
 Moldovan schools and kindergartens are like 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.590
 specially tightening our stranglehold 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.780
 Republic but the main thing that they are trying to 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.970
 hide the Moldovan authorities it is absolutely 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.919
 russian spirit transdniestria tiraspol and in 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.320
 unlike chisinau and kiev nobody 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:21.370
 questions the celebration of May 9th 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.810
 for us may 9 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.590
 first of all it is a great holiday 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.780
 wins it 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.610
 celebration of the feat and courage of those people 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:33.240
 who fought for our homeland 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.410
 against brown plague and i think 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.630
 Transnistrian people never 

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.960
 will allow the repetition of this on our 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.940
 earth 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.950
 on the streets of Transnistrian cities already 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.140
 distribute St. George ribbons honoring 

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:45.210
 veterans spend various promotions and 

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:47.540
 events dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the great 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.860
 victories and any attempts 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:52.110
 rename holiday or downplay 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:58.740
 the value of the feat of the Soviet people here 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:07:01.290
 no, I surely am a participant 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:04.710
 I have long wanted to be in the rear every year. 

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:09.240
 handed out on the bus a lot of wishing him 

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:10.350
 on the ribbon fasten so that 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.320
 do 

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:15.120
 thank you very much, this is a holiday 

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.860
 apparently, and try to hide 

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.400
 Moldovan authorities do not allow 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:21.570
 transdniestria russian magazine 

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.430
