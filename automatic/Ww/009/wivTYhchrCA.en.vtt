who's<00:01:18.630> better<00:01:18.899> well<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.470> think<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.920> our

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
who's better well I think that our

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.590 
who's better well I think that our
backgrounds<00:01:20.729> are<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:20.970> different<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.450> know<00:01:21.570> I

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600

come from a motor racing background
Tanner<00:01:23.610> comes<00:01:23.880> from<00:01:24.060> more<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.300> a<00:01:24.509> drifting

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
Tanner comes from more of a drifting

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
showman type stunt driving background so

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.529 
showman type stunt driving background so
you<00:01:29.340> know<00:01:29.550> when<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:29.759> comes<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.119> racing

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:30.539 
you know when it comes to the racing

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:32.270 
you know when it comes to the racing
aspect<00:01:31.080> I<00:01:31.140> think<00:01:31.350> there's<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.590> pretty<00:01:32.100> strong

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
aspect I think there's a pretty strong

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.310 
aspect I think there's a pretty strong
advantage<00:01:32.759> for<00:01:32.910> me<00:01:33.090> but<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:33.960> know<00:01:34.020> he's<00:01:34.140> got

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
advantage for me but you know he's got

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.900 
advantage for me but you know he's got
the<00:01:34.440> advantage<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:34.890> having<00:01:35.070> run<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.820> know

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:35.910 
the advantage of having run you know

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.830 
the advantage of having run you know
these<00:01:36.180> type<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.780> cars<00:01:37.050> four-wheel<00:01:37.560> drive<00:01:37.800> cars

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
these type of cars four-wheel drive cars

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.540 
these type of cars four-wheel drive cars
so<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.110> we'll<00:01:40.259> see<00:01:40.410> in<00:01:40.530> any<00:01:40.890> case<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.130> think<00:01:41.280> it

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
so so we'll see in any case I think it

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.419 
so so we'll see in any case I think it
will<00:01:41.940> we'll<00:01:42.810> make<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:42.990> good<00:01:43.170> team<00:01:43.410> our<00:01:43.890> goal<00:01:44.250> for
