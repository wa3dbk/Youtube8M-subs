00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
my last episode I was on liberation and

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.160 
my last episode I was on liberation and
it<00:01:09.230> was<00:01:09.350> a<00:01:09.380> MOAB<00:01:09.770> by<00:01:09.950> me<00:01:10.190> so<00:01:10.730> I<00:01:11.090> recommend<00:01:11.720> using

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
it was a MOAB by me so I recommend using

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.220 
it was a MOAB by me so I recommend using
the<00:01:12.320> ACR<00:01:13.250> and<00:01:13.550> skaara<00:01:13.970> on<00:01:14.330> this<00:01:14.480> map<00:01:14.690> and<00:01:14.960> the

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.230 
the ACR and skaara on this map and the

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.710 
the ACR and skaara on this map and the
mp7<00:01:15.560> can<00:01:16.250> pass<00:01:16.490> because<00:01:16.760> of<00:01:17.030> its<00:01:17.180> low<00:01:17.420> recoil

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
mp7 can pass because of its low recoil

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.380 
mp7 can pass because of its low recoil
now<00:01:18.530> you<00:01:18.650> want<00:01:18.980> to<00:01:19.070> use<00:01:19.160> a<00:01:19.190> higher<00:01:19.970> firing

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
now you want to use a higher firing

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.200 
now you want to use a higher firing

because it's because of its low rico and

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.630 
because it's because of its low rico and
because<00:01:38.840> of<00:01:38.870> its<00:01:39.140> low<00:01:39.290> recoil<00:01:39.560> you<00:01:40.280> can<00:01:40.430> win

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
because of its low recoil you can win

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.280 
because of its low recoil you can win
most<00:01:40.970> of<00:01:41.150> your<00:01:41.330> loan<00:01:41.510> long<00:01:41.990> distance

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
most of your loan long distance

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.200 
most of your loan long distance
engagements<00:01:43.130> unless<00:01:43.610> it's<00:01:43.790> like<00:01:43.940> with<00:01:44.090> the

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
engagements unless it's like with the

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.360 
engagements unless it's like with the
sniper<00:01:44.540> or<00:01:44.750> something<00:01:45.110> of<00:01:45.230> that<00:01:45.260> nature<00:01:45.470> so

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
sniper or something of that nature so

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.460 
sniper or something of that nature so
when<00:01:46.550> you're<00:01:46.670> using<00:01:46.910> the<00:01:47.240> AC<00:01:47.450> are<00:01:47.840> you<00:01:48.260> want<00:01:48.410> to

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
when you're using the AC are you want to

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.050 
when you're using the AC are you want to
use<00:01:48.590> it<00:01:48.620> with<00:01:48.860> the<00:01:48.950> suppressor<00:01:49.310> attachment

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
use it with the suppressor attachment

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.150 
use it with the suppressor attachment
and<00:01:50.270> I<00:01:50.420> recommend<00:01:50.840> using<00:01:51.050> the<00:01:51.200> proficiency<00:01:52.130> of

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
and I recommend using the proficiency of

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.520 
and I recommend using the proficiency of
impact<00:01:53.150> because<00:01:53.480> a<00:01:53.630> lot<00:01:53.870> of<00:01:53.900> people<00:01:54.020> tend<00:01:54.470> to

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
impact because a lot of people tend to

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.080 
impact because a lot of people tend to
go<00:01:54.770> in<00:01:55.010> the<00:01:55.130> helicopter<00:01:55.250> when<00:01:55.880> playing

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
go in the helicopter when playing

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.210 
go in the helicopter when playing
domination<00:01:56.720> on<00:01:56.840> this<00:01:56.960> map<00:01:57.140> you<00:01:57.650> can<00:01:57.800> easily

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
domination on this map you can easily

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.010 
domination on this map you can easily
shoot<00:01:58.400> that<00:01:58.610> a<00:01:58.640> helicopter<00:01:59.300> and<00:01:59.540> get<00:01:59.840> you<00:01:59.960> a

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
shoot that a helicopter and get you a

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.990 
shoot that a helicopter and get you a
couple<00:02:00.320> of<00:02:00.350> walbanks<00:02:00.830> so<00:02:01.280> I<00:02:01.310> recommend<00:02:01.580> using

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
couple of walbanks so I recommend using

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.630 
couple of walbanks so I recommend using
impact<00:02:02.540> for<00:02:02.870> that<00:02:03.110> reason<00:02:03.380> and<00:02:03.710> when<00:02:04.190> on<00:02:04.460> the

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
impact for that reason and when on the

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.400 
impact for that reason and when on the
when<00:02:04.910> playing<00:02:05.150> on<00:02:05.360> this<00:02:05.510> map<00:02:05.720> you<00:02:06.140> want<00:02:06.320> to

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
when playing on this map you want to

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.410 
when playing on this map you want to
stay<00:02:06.560> around<00:02:06.680> the<00:02:06.950> B<00:02:07.160> area<00:02:07.490> because<00:02:08.000> you<00:02:08.179> get<00:02:08.360> a

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
stay around the B area because you get a

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.999 
stay around the B area because you get a
lot<00:02:08.509> of<00:02:08.780> traffic<00:02:09.140> and<00:02:09.470> if<00:02:09.740> you're<00:02:09.890> running

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
lot of traffic and if you're running

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.620 
lot of traffic and if you're running
portable<00:02:10.610> radar<00:02:10.789> you<00:02:11.030> can<00:02:11.090> see<00:02:11.210> where<00:02:11.510> the

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
portable radar you can see where the

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.300 
portable radar you can see where the
enemies<00:02:11.960> are<00:02:11.990> coming<00:02:12.410> from<00:02:12.560> what<00:02:13.190> direction

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
enemies are coming from what direction

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.610 
enemies are coming from what direction
and<00:02:13.820> how<00:02:13.910> many<00:02:14.210> are<00:02:14.330> coming<00:02:14.390> at<00:02:14.780> you<00:02:14.990> at<00:02:15.110> one

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
and how many are coming at you at one

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.830 
and how many are coming at you at one
I'm<00:02:15.709> so<00:02:16.159> basically<00:02:16.610> all<00:02:16.640> you<00:02:17.209> guys<00:02:17.299> need<00:02:17.690> to

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
like a DPM 9 or something but I

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.800 
like a DPM 9 or something but I
automatic<00:02:25.340> assault<00:02:25.610> rifle<00:02:26.060> that's<00:02:26.420> good<00:02:26.690> at

automatic assault rifle that's good at

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.780 
automatic assault rifle that's good at
long<00:02:27.019> distance<00:02:27.500> engagements<00:02:28.099> in<00:02:28.190> medium

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790

distance engagements after the park

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.589 
distance engagements after the park
loadout<00:02:31.069> I<00:02:31.190> recommend<00:02:31.640> using<00:02:31.790> scavenger<00:02:32.569> or

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
loadout I recommend using scavenger or

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:35.880 
loadout I recommend using scavenger or
either<00:02:33.140> sleight<00:02:33.620> of<00:02:33.650> hand<00:02:33.980> and<00:02:34.599> assassin<00:02:35.599> and

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
either sleight of hand and assassin and

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.530 
either sleight of hand and assassin and
marksman<00:02:36.890> or<00:02:37.069> stalker<00:02:37.400> can<00:02:37.730> pass<00:02:37.909> on<00:02:38.090> this<00:02:38.269> map

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
marksman or stalker can pass on this map

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.569 
marksman or stalker can pass on this map
but<00:02:39.049> I<00:02:39.079> recommend<00:02:39.379> using<00:02:39.709> marksmen<00:02:40.280> because

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
but I recommend using marksmen because

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:42.610 
but I recommend using marksmen because
you<00:02:40.760> get<00:02:40.909> this<00:02:41.180> map<00:02:41.420> gets<00:02:41.720> long<00:02:41.959> very<00:02:42.260> quick

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
you get this map gets long very quick

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.619 
you get this map gets long very quick
right<00:02:43.159> there<00:02:43.190> you<00:02:43.459> see<00:02:43.640> marksman's<00:02:44.239> working

right there you see marksman's working
form<00:02:44.900> right<00:02:45.049> here<00:02:45.290> so<00:02:45.680> it's<00:02:45.799> playing<00:02:46.040> smart

class<00:03:10.099> setup<00:03:10.209> recommend<00:03:11.209> using<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.569> portable

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
class setup recommend using the portable

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.380 
class setup recommend using the portable
radar<00:03:12.319> because<00:03:12.769> it's<00:03:12.950> very<00:03:13.400> very<00:03:13.760> useful<00:03:14.000> when

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
radar because it's very very useful when

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.149 
radar because it's very very useful when
getting<00:03:14.840> in<00:03:15.019> this<00:03:15.140> airplane<00:03:15.560> you<00:03:15.799> can<00:03:15.950> place

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:16.159 
getting in this airplane you can place

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:18.369 
getting in this airplane you can place
it<00:03:16.340> down<00:03:16.459> and<00:03:16.760> pick<00:03:17.090> up<00:03:17.239> enemies<00:03:17.720> easily<00:03:18.200> and

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:18.379 
it down and pick up enemies easily and

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:21.490 
it down and pick up enemies easily and
assassin<00:03:19.040> is<00:03:19.780> marksmen<00:03:20.780> is<00:03:20.870> working<00:03:21.230> for<00:03:21.380> them

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
assassin is marksmen is working for them

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.500 
assassin is marksmen is working for them
right<00:03:21.620> there<00:03:21.829> again<00:03:22.160> even<00:03:22.880> those<00:03:23.030> close<00:03:23.299> this

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
right there again even those close this

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.569 
right there again even those close this
limiting<00:03:23.959> its<00:03:24.230> close<00:03:24.530> distance<00:03:24.980> engagements

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
limiting its close distance engagements

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.849 
limiting its close distance engagements
with<00:03:25.700> marksman<00:03:26.299> it's<00:03:26.690> very<00:03:27.019> good<00:03:27.500> because

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
with marksman it's very good because

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:29.979 
with marksman it's very good because
they<00:03:27.980> can<00:03:28.130> highlight<00:03:28.549> the<00:03:29.060> enemy<00:03:29.389> and<00:03:29.630> you<00:03:29.810> can
