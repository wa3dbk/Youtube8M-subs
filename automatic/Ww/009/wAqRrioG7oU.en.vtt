00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
all the features of the sim automatic

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.649 
all the features of the sim automatic
now<00:02:21.459> it's<00:02:21.610> going<00:02:21.730> to<00:02:21.790> be<00:02:21.879> much<00:02:22.030> easier<00:02:22.060> for<00:02:22.420> me

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:22.659 
now it's going to be much easier for me

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:24.180 
now it's going to be much easier for me
to<00:02:22.690> show<00:02:23.049> you<00:02:23.110> how<00:02:23.379> the<00:02:23.440> semi<00:02:23.739> automatic

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
to show you how the semi automatic

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.160 
to show you how the semi automatic
functions<00:02:24.640> instead<00:02:25.239> of<00:02:25.450> trying<00:02:25.720> to<00:02:25.810> tell<00:02:25.989> you

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
functions instead of trying to tell you

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.229

gun will then be loaded and ready to

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.050 
gun will then be loaded and ready to
fire<00:03:15.849> now<00:03:16.329> there's<00:03:16.540> two<00:03:16.690> ways<00:03:16.840> to<00:03:16.900> do<00:03:17.200> this<00:03:18.060> you

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
fire now there's two ways to do this you

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.490 
fire now there's two ways to do this you
can<00:03:19.209> either<00:03:19.359> just<00:03:19.780> grab<00:03:20.019> the<00:03:20.170> rear<00:03:20.319> of<00:03:20.410> the

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
can either just grab the rear of the

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.349 
can either just grab the rear of the
slide<00:03:20.739> pull<00:03:21.010> it<00:03:21.160> to<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.280> rear<00:03:21.519> and<00:03:21.549> let<00:03:21.910> go<00:03:22.090> or

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
slide pull it to the rear and let go or

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:23.909 
slide pull it to the rear and let go or

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:22.660 
have to admit it it's not bad ah but

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.150 
have to admit it it's not bad ah but
it's<00:06:22.810> a<00:06:22.870> little<00:06:23.020> it's<00:06:23.350> a<00:06:23.440> little<00:06:23.470> bit<00:06:23.770> zinger

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160 
it's a little it's a little bit zinger

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.430 
it's a little it's a little bit zinger
that's<00:06:24.550> a<00:06:24.640> little<00:06:24.850> snappy<00:06:25.180> this<00:06:25.810> is<00:06:25.960> a<00:06:25.990> 380

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:26.440 
that's a little snappy this is a 380

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.170 
that's a little snappy this is a 380
caliber<00:06:26.680> so<00:06:27.040> it's<00:06:27.190> not<00:06:27.310> too<00:06:27.460> bad<00:06:27.610> even<00:06:27.850> the

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:28.180 
caliber so it's not too bad even the

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.630 
caliber so it's not too bad even the
small<00:06:28.510> very<00:06:29.380> small<00:06:29.440> lightweight<00:06:29.890> frame<00:06:30.340> and

small very small lightweight frame and

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.340 
small very small lightweight frame and
of<00:06:30.700> course<00:06:30.880> the<00:06:30.970> advantage<00:06:31.360> is<00:06:31.510> that<00:06:32.020> it's<00:06:32.200> so

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:32.350 
of course the advantage is that it's so

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.080 
of course the advantage is that it's so
small<00:06:32.620> you<00:06:32.890> can<00:06:33.040> take<00:06:33.370> it<00:06:33.490> anywhere<00:06:33.700> you

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090 
small you can take it anywhere you

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:35.640 
small you can take it anywhere you
pocket<00:06:34.330> anything<00:06:34.930> I<00:06:35.020> mean<00:06:35.200> that<00:06:35.320> would<00:06:35.440> even

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 
pocket anything I mean that would even

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.440 
pocket anything I mean that would even
fit<00:06:35.800> in<00:06:35.980> you<00:06:36.250> know<00:06:36.370> ankle<00:06:36.790> anything<00:06:37.000> very

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:37.450 
fit in you know ankle anything very

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.340 
fit in you know ankle anything very
easily<00:06:37.690> yes<00:06:38.200> and<00:06:38.350> but<00:06:38.680> again<00:06:39.040> definitely<00:06:40.350> the

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:41.350 
easily yes and but again definitely the

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:42.450 
easily yes and but again definitely the
bigger<00:06:41.560> guns<00:06:41.770> are<00:06:41.890> more<00:06:41.980> comfortable<00:06:42.340> to

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:42.460 
bigger guns are more comfortable to

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:43.830 
bigger guns are more comfortable to
shoot<00:06:42.640> and<00:06:42.970> these<00:06:43.120> are<00:06:43.330> the<00:06:43.450> ones<00:06:43.630> that<00:06:43.690> we
