swiftly<00:02:13.269> and<00:02:13.810> very<00:02:14.079> efficiently<00:02:15.030> if<00:02:16.030> there

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
swiftly and very efficiently if there

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.280 
swiftly and very efficiently if there
are<00:02:16.269> a<00:02:16.299> couple<00:02:16.420> more<00:02:16.630> little<00:02:16.900> marks<00:02:17.170> that

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
are a couple more little marks that

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.860 
are a couple more little marks that
won't<00:02:17.470> go<00:02:17.680> you<00:02:17.859> can<00:02:18.010> up<00:02:18.100> here<00:02:18.720> get<00:02:19.720> rid<00:02:19.840> of

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
won't go you can up here get rid of

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.140 
won't go you can up here get rid of
there<00:02:20.109> that's<00:02:21.010> a<00:02:21.100> piece<00:02:21.280> of<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.579> polyurethane

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
there that's a piece of the polyurethane

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.710 
there that's a piece of the polyurethane
that's<00:02:22.690> been<00:02:22.870> knocked<00:02:23.139> off<00:02:23.489> and<00:02:24.600> then<00:02:25.600> restore

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
that's been knocked off and then restore

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.599 
that's been knocked off and then restore
a<00:02:25.930> finish<00:02:26.200> won't<00:02:26.380> fix<00:02:26.590> that<00:02:26.889> with<00:02:27.340> all<00:02:27.459> these

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:27.609 
a finish won't fix that with all these

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:28.740 
a finish won't fix that with all these
marks<00:02:28.000> down<00:02:28.180> here

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
marks down here

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.330 
marks down here
they<00:02:29.440> just<00:02:29.709> go<00:02:31.230> so<00:02:32.230> on<00:02:32.410> this<00:02:32.500> polyurethane

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
they just go so on this polyurethane

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.300 
they just go so on this polyurethane
piece<00:02:33.670> it's<00:02:34.600> coming<00:02:34.959> up<00:02:35.049> really<00:02:35.290> nicely<00:02:35.590> as

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
piece it's coming up really nicely as

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.640 
piece it's coming up really nicely as
you<00:02:36.340> can<00:02:36.549> see<00:02:36.959> there<00:02:37.959> are<00:02:38.049> just<00:02:38.079> those<00:02:38.350> few

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
you can see there are just those few

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.479 
you can see there are just those few
little<00:02:38.769> marks<00:02:39.510> if<00:02:40.510> they<00:02:40.720> were<00:02:40.870> select<00:02:41.489> they

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
little marks if they were select they

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:43.740 
little marks if they were select they
can<00:02:42.639> be<00:02:42.730> covered<00:02:42.910> up<00:02:43.090> pretty<00:02:43.269> well<00:02:43.359> straight

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
can be covered up pretty well straight

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.509 
can be covered up pretty well straight
away<00:02:43.989> permanently<00:02:44.739> but<00:02:45.220> as<00:02:45.370> it's

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
away permanently but as it's

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.300 
away permanently but as it's
polyurethane<00:02:46.239> to<00:02:46.780> doing<00:02:46.989> a<00:02:47.049> nice<00:02:47.230> job<00:02:47.310> was

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
polyurethane to doing a nice job was

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.190 
polyurethane to doing a nice job was
making<00:02:48.670> it<00:02:48.730> look<00:02:48.849> really<00:02:48.910> acceptable<00:02:49.750> whereas

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
making it look really acceptable whereas

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.319 
making it look really acceptable whereas
before<00:02:50.500> it<00:02:50.620> wasn't<00:02:50.769> acceptable<00:02:51.340> but<00:02:52.150> there

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
before it wasn't acceptable but there

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:54.240 
before it wasn't acceptable but there
will<00:02:52.480> be<00:02:52.540> just<00:02:53.230> a<00:02:53.349> few<00:02:53.380> little<00:02:53.709> marks<00:02:54.160> that

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
will be just a few little marks that

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.620 
will be just a few little marks that
perhaps<00:02:54.430> and<00:02:54.970> just<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:55.209> little<00:02:55.299> bit<00:02:55.480> more

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
perhaps and just a little bit more

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.650 
perhaps and just a little bit more
difficult<00:02:56.079> to<00:02:56.200> move<00:02:56.349> but<00:02:56.950> then<00:02:57.130> you<00:02:57.250> have

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
difficult to move but then you have

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.210 
difficult to move but then you have
probably<00:02:58.660> urethane<00:02:59.170> and<00:02:59.500> restore<00:02:59.829> a<00:02:59.859> finish

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
probably urethane and restore a finish

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.620 
probably urethane and restore a finish
not<00:03:00.940> bad<00:03:01.209> and<00:03:01.450> by<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:01.810> way<00:03:02.019> before<00:03:02.230> you<00:03:02.380> go
