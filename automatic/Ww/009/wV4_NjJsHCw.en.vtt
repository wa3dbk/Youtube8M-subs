okay okay so this is my 94 Nissan Sentra
one<00:00:06.390> of<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.540> fuel<00:00:06.839> injectors<00:00:07.290> had<00:00:07.470> one<00:00:07.649> out

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
one of the fuel injectors had one out

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.220 
one of the fuel injectors had one out
I'm<00:00:08.130> not<00:00:08.309> sure<00:00:08.460> if<00:00:08.519> it's<00:00:08.639> cylinder<00:00:09.059> number<00:00:09.809> two

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
I'm not sure if it's cylinder number two

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.540 
I'm not sure if it's cylinder number two
or<00:00:10.380> number<00:00:10.410> three<00:00:10.650> what<00:00:11.070> would<00:00:11.250> you<00:00:11.429> would

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.499 
or number three what would you would
call<00:00:11.969> it<00:00:12.210> but<00:00:13.070> also<00:00:14.070> I<00:00:14.639> had<00:00:14.849> been<00:00:15.059> messing<00:00:15.480> with

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
call it but also I had been messing with

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.529 
call it but also I had been messing with
my<00:00:15.800> idle<00:00:16.800> air<00:00:17.789> control<00:00:17.820> valve<00:00:19.100> without

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:20.539 
my idle air control valve without

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:22.820 
my idle air control valve without
knowing<00:00:21.539> that<00:00:21.840> messing<00:00:22.230> with<00:00:22.260> that<00:00:22.500> screw

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
knowing that messing with that screw

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.080 
knowing that messing with that screw
would<00:00:23.130> really<00:00:23.689> mess<00:00:24.689> me<00:00:24.990> up<00:00:25.019> bad<00:00:25.470> so<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.220> messed

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
would really mess me up bad so I messed

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.540 
would really mess me up bad so I messed
with<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.480> back<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.410> little<00:00:28.859> by<00:00:28.949> little<00:00:29.220> I'm

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
with it back a little by little I'm

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.749 
with it back a little by little I'm
pretty<00:00:30.119> close<00:00:30.539> right<00:00:30.960> now<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.560> think<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:32.550> can

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
pretty close right now I think you can

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.740 
pretty close right now I think you can
see<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.239> my<00:00:33.360> rpms<00:00:33.930> I'm<00:00:34.170> about<00:00:34.410> at<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:35.480> 7<00:00:36.480> 800

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
see it my rpms I'm about at that 7 800

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.660 
see it my rpms I'm about at that 7 800
and<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.770> think<00:00:37.980> that's<00:00:38.129> pretty<00:00:38.250> close<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.550> what

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
and I think that's pretty close to what

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.530 
and I think that's pretty close to what
it's<00:00:38.910> supposed<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.270> be

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
it's supposed to be

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.430 
it's supposed to be
it's<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.379> 94<00:00:41.160> Nissan<00:00:41.610> Sentra<00:00:42.230> 1.6<00:00:43.230> liter

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
it's a 94 Nissan Sentra 1.6 liter

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.790 
it's a 94 Nissan Sentra 1.6 liter
automatic<00:00:44.129> transmission<00:00:45.050> and<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.469> also

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
automatic transmission and so also

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.010 
automatic transmission and so also
another<00:00:47.280> thing<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.579> started<00:00:48.059> happening<00:00:48.270> my

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
another thing that started happening my

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.389 
another thing that started happening my
check<00:00:49.260> engine<00:00:49.440> light<00:00:49.739> went<00:00:49.950> off<00:00:50.010> which<00:00:50.250> is

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
check engine light went off which is

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.350 
check engine light went off which is
good<00:00:50.780> but<00:00:51.780> now<00:00:52.260> listen<00:00:52.890> when<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.280> push<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.180> gas

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
good but now listen when I push the gas

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.750 
good but now listen when I push the gas
pedal<00:00:54.390> it's<00:00:55.199> as<00:00:55.410> if<00:00:55.590> there's<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.860> hesitation

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
pedal it's as if there's a hesitation

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.049 
pedal it's as if there's a hesitation
and<00:00:56.969> like<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.390> gurgle<00:00:57.930> or<00:00:58.649> like<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.890> pop<00:00:59.309> I'm<00:00:59.670> not

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
and like a gurgle or like a pop I'm not

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.220 
and like a gurgle or like a pop I'm not
sure<00:01:00.270> what<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.539> but<00:01:00.809> see<00:01:01.050> if<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.140> can

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
sure what it is but see if you can

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.410 
sure what it is but see if you can
listen

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.450 

it<00:01:05.420> wasn't<00:01:05.900> that<00:01:05.930> bad<00:01:06.260> this<00:01:06.560> time<00:01:06.830> but<00:01:07.430> uh

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
it wasn't that bad this time but uh

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.900 
it wasn't that bad this time but uh
let's<00:01:08.390> see

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.670 

so<00:01:12.910> it<00:01:13.390> almost<00:01:13.570> sounds<00:01:13.900> as<00:01:13.990> if<00:01:14.020> there's<00:01:14.290> a<00:01:14.350> miss

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
so it almost sounds as if there's a miss

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.280 
so it almost sounds as if there's a miss
it<00:01:15.430> takes<00:01:15.820> a<00:01:16.030> little<00:01:16.210> bit<00:01:16.360> of<00:01:16.420> a<00:01:16.570> second<00:01:17.020> for<00:01:17.260> it

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
it takes a little bit of a second for it

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.180 
it takes a little bit of a second for it
to<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:18.670> get<00:01:18.940> up<00:01:19.230> one<00:01:20.230> once<00:01:20.620> I<00:01:20.740> start<00:01:20.950> pushing

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
to to get up one once I start pushing

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.890 
to to get up one once I start pushing
the<00:01:21.280> gas<00:01:21.400> pedal<00:01:21.730> it's<00:01:21.850> like<00:01:21.940> it<00:01:22.060> takes<00:01:22.150> a<00:01:22.360> few

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
the gas pedal it's like it takes a few

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.870 
the gas pedal it's like it takes a few
moments<00:01:23.050> for<00:01:23.350> it<00:01:23.410> to<00:01:23.500> build<00:01:23.710> up<00:01:23.860> to<00:01:24.460> get<00:01:24.640> up<00:01:24.760> to

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
moments for it to build up to get up to

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.720 
moments for it to build up to get up to
where<00:01:25.000> it's<00:01:25.090> supposed<00:01:25.180> to<00:01:25.420> be<00:01:26.370> that<00:01:27.370> time<00:01:27.610> it

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:27.730 
where it's supposed to be that time it

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:33.960 
where it's supposed to be that time it
was<00:01:27.820> pretty<00:01:28.000> smooth<00:01:28.650> it's<00:01:29.650> good<00:01:32.700> there<00:01:33.700> was

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
was pretty smooth it's good there was

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.210 
was pretty smooth it's good there was
there<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:35.350> I<00:01:35.380> think<00:01:35.470> you<00:01:35.710> were<00:01:35.800> able<00:01:35.860> to<00:01:36.010> hear

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
there so I think you were able to hear

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.140 
there so I think you were able to hear
and<00:01:36.370> hope<00:01:36.490> you're<00:01:36.610> able<00:01:36.670> to<00:01:36.790> hear<00:01:36.940> at<00:01:37.060> that

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
and hope you're able to hear at that

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:49.370 
and hope you're able to hear at that
time<00:01:37.740> I'll<00:01:38.740> show<00:01:39.190> you<00:01:39.250> the<00:01:39.520> engine<00:01:40.090> now

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.830 

so<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.040> could<00:01:50.189> see<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.549> new<00:01:50.670> injector<00:01:51.270> but

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
so you could see the new injector but

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.179 
so you could see the new injector but
see<00:01:52.320> if<00:01:52.409> we<00:01:52.470> can<00:01:52.590> get<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.740> better<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.009> listen

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
see if we can get a better to listen

00:01:53.189 --> 00:02:00.020 
see if we can get a better to listen
this<00:01:53.580> way

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:07.830 

it<00:02:00.630> sounded<00:02:01.049> good<00:02:01.200> there

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.700 

huh

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
huh

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.980 
huh
it's<00:02:10.160> actually<00:02:10.550> not<00:02:10.670> doing<00:02:11.030> it<00:02:11.150> now<00:02:11.330> that's

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
it's actually not doing it now that's

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:19.860 
it's actually not doing it now that's
ironic<00:02:13.270> huh<00:02:14.270> okay<00:02:17.140> not<00:02:18.140> that<00:02:18.170> it<00:02:18.470> matters<00:02:18.890> but

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
ironic huh okay not that it matters but

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
ironic huh okay not that it matters but
I<00:02:19.930> can't

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
I can't

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.290 
I can't
and<00:02:22.220> I<00:02:22.400> know<00:02:22.460> that<00:02:22.700> that's<00:02:22.820> not<00:02:23.060> how<00:02:23.240> you

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
and I know that that's not how you

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.060 
and I know that that's not how you
supposed<00:02:23.540> to<00:02:23.570> set<00:02:23.900> it<00:02:24.050> but<00:02:24.200> I<00:02:24.440> don't<00:02:24.800> have<00:02:25.010> a

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
supposed to set it but I don't have a

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.710 
supposed to set it but I don't have a
obd<00:02:25.550> one<00:02:25.760> reader<00:02:26.000> so<00:02:26.870> I<00:02:26.900> suppose<00:02:27.530> I<00:02:27.800> could<00:02:27.980> get

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
obd one reader so I suppose I could get

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.840 
obd one reader so I suppose I could get
so<00:02:29.720> any<00:02:30.350> advice<00:02:30.680> that<00:02:30.890> you<00:02:31.220> might<00:02:31.580> have<00:02:31.790> on
