00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.619
 Welcome to this video it 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:12.150
 this is about geometric base bodies 

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:15.059
 part 1 cubes prism prism you know 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.970
 already the triangles and quadrilaterals 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.779
 surfaces are after the video you know 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:25.640
 that cube cuboid and prism body 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.640
 are the surfaces emerge 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:36.660
 answer in the first part of the video 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.240
 As the question what are bodies in the second 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.760
 Part we try the most important 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.460
 Recognizing properties of a dice 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.300
 a cuboid and a priest 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.060
 formulate 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.120
 in the third part we deal with 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:54.900
 the edges and corners of the square 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:58.650
 Part 4 is about the dice one 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:01.500
 special quarter 5 we discuss 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.930
 an interesting body the prism 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.200
 and finally in the sixth and last 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:17.969
 Part I give some examples where you can 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:20.280
 First of all, these three bodies meet something 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:22.170
 the bodies are the three bodies we 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.499
 I will discuss here today 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:29.819
 you can be right with them 

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:32.340
 good length width and height determine what 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:36.270
 is possible with our body at the 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:41.009
 Body top right and also the body 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:43.049
 thus, left are bodies 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:47.700
 complete movie and many more 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:51.180
 you can find it on www sofatutor.com

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.409
 you need to know for good grades tests
