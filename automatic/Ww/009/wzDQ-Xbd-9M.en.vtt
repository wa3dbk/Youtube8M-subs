00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:46.830 
you're just going to wrap it around the
corner<00:02:26.520> of<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.640> heart

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.000 

so<00:02:47.840> when<00:02:48.080> you're<00:02:48.200> done<00:02:48.380> with<00:02:48.560> that<00:02:48.590> you<00:02:48.980> should

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
so when you're done with that you should

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.590 
so when you're done with that you should
have<00:02:49.370> something<00:02:49.640> like<00:02:49.820> this<00:02:50.000> so<00:02:50.450> I<00:02:50.480> actually

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
have something like this so I actually

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.540 
have something like this so I actually
had<00:02:50.930> to<00:02:51.050> fix<00:02:51.260> the<00:02:51.410> middle<00:02:51.830> because<00:02:51.950> it<00:02:52.160> started

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
had to fix the middle because it started

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.640 
had to fix the middle because it started
becoming<00:02:52.730> a<00:02:53.300> little<00:02:54.250> smaller<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:55.580> weird<00:02:56.030> so

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
becoming a little smaller and weird so

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.140 
becoming a little smaller and weird so
this<00:02:57.650> is<00:02:57.830> how<00:02:58.070> it<00:02:58.220> should<00:02:58.430> look<00:02:58.460> like<00:02:58.670> and<00:02:59.060> then

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
this is how it should look like and then

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.690 
this is how it should look like and then
next<00:03:00.110> year<00:03:00.320> that's<00:03:00.530> going<00:03:00.680> to<00:03:00.980> do<00:03:01.190> the<00:03:01.490> two

home<00:05:34.120> as<00:05:34.270> well<00:05:34.449> I<00:05:34.690> mean<00:05:35.080> at<00:05:35.229> all<00:05:35.409> so<00:05:36.009> like<00:05:36.310> all

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
home as well I mean at all so like all

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.159 
home as well I mean at all so like all
these<00:05:36.669> little<00:05:36.820> corners<00:05:37.150> leave<00:05:37.690> them<00:05:37.930> black

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.169 
these little corners leave them black

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:51.480 
these little corners leave them black
and<00:05:38.530> don't<00:05:38.770> paint<00:05:39.009> them<00:05:39.190> gold

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.150 

okay<00:05:52.490> so<00:05:52.550> I'm<00:05:53.060> done<00:05:53.300> painting<00:05:53.630> it<00:05:53.930> and<00:05:54.110> you<00:05:55.010> can

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160 
okay so I'm done painting it and you can

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.129 
okay so I'm done painting it and you can
actually<00:05:55.310> use<00:05:55.639> your<00:05:55.790> fingers<00:05:56.090> to<00:05:56.120> stipple<00:05:56.930> it

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:57.139 
actually use your fingers to stipple it

00:05:57.139 --> 00:05:58.690 
actually use your fingers to stipple it
so<00:05:57.320> that<00:05:57.500> it<00:05:57.620> won't<00:05:57.770> look<00:05:58.010> like<00:05:58.070> it's<00:05:58.430> very

00:05:58.690 --> 00:05:58.700 
so that it won't look like it's very

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.240 
so that it won't look like it's very
very<00:05:58.850> gold<00:05:59.389> because<00:06:00.050> vintage<00:06:00.500> charms<00:06:00.980> don't

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.250 
very gold because vintage charms don't

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.790 
very gold because vintage charms don't
have<00:06:01.550> very<00:06:02.000> solid<00:06:02.300> gold<00:06:02.720> and<00:06:02.960> then<00:06:03.530> the

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
have very solid gold and then the

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.640 
have very solid gold and then the
painting<00:06:04.130> is<00:06:04.250> not<00:06:04.430> exactly<00:06:05.000> perfect<00:06:05.150> so<00:06:05.930> I

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
painting is not exactly perfect so I

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.129 
painting is not exactly perfect so I
mean<00:06:07.190> not<00:06:07.310> painting<00:06:07.730> like<00:06:07.970> the<00:06:08.510> little<00:06:08.930> color

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:09.139 
mean not painting like the little color

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:11.379 
mean not painting like the little color
on<00:06:09.230> it<00:06:09.590> the<00:06:09.860> gold<00:06:10.070> color<00:06:10.340> is<00:06:10.520> not<00:06:10.700> perfect

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:11.389 
on it the gold color is not perfect

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:13.780 
on it the gold color is not perfect
because<00:06:12.139> you<00:06:12.380> know<00:06:12.500> sometimes<00:06:12.800> it<00:06:13.190> it<00:06:13.460> just

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:13.790 
because you know sometimes it it just

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.520 
because you know sometimes it it just
goes<00:06:14.090> for<00:06:14.300> very<00:06:14.510> long<00:06:14.720> and<00:06:14.960> it<00:06:15.050> starts

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:15.530 
goes for very long and it starts

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.770 
goes for very long and it starts
becoming<00:06:15.650> black<00:06:16.070> in<00:06:16.250> some<00:06:16.400> areas<00:06:16.820> like<00:06:17.030> this

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:17.780 
becoming black in some areas like this

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.980 
becoming black in some areas like this
