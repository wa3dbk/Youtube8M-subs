00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:13.670
 he left a mark on his forehead but he continues 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.670
 strong 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.990

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.159
 drunk prisoner matador gets that 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.159
 actor 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.289

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.759
 also the loss of memory is a 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.380
 effect that has seen them 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.380

 At least he has more of these than 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.290
 dillinger and that's why I think he won 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.060
 why 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.310

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.810
 rockefeller spam and take advantage of that 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:42.780
 gray and crystalline and blue to form us 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.780
 because matadores kills creeps 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.980

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.980
 and I did it 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.980

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:15.349

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.879

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:18.829

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:25.879
 the invoke in our game 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.879
 to suck the today that today 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.200

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.640
