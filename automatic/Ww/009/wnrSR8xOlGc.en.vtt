at<00:00:21.539> playing<00:00:21.900> you<00:00:22.289> know<00:00:22.380> an<00:00:22.560> anime<00:00:23.010> based<00:00:23.220> game

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
at playing you know an anime based game

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.370 
at playing you know an anime based game
but<00:00:23.880> in<00:00:23.970> this<00:00:24.060> case<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.750> know<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:24.900> thought<00:00:25.260> I'd

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
but in this case you know I thought I'd

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.380 
but in this case you know I thought I'd
give<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.800> go<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.310> is<00:00:26.460> based<00:00:26.760> off<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.029> the

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
give it a go and it is based off of the

give it a go and it is based off of the
sky<00:00:27.750> crawlers<00:00:27.830> anime<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.039> apparently<00:00:29.609> that's

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
sky crawlers anime and apparently that's

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.450 
sky crawlers anime and apparently that's
a<00:00:30.119> good<00:00:30.390> anime<00:00:30.779> that<00:00:31.080> people<00:00:31.710> do<00:00:31.859> like<00:00:32.130> in

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
I believe that these are all part of the

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.180 
I believe that these are all part of the
anime<00:00:36.300> itself<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.140> animation<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:37.739> great

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
anime itself and the animation is great

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.010 
anime itself and the animation is great

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
that coordinated to do two things at

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.080 
that coordinated to do two things at
once<00:01:03.780> thankfully<00:01:04.680> there<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.519> gamecube

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
once thankfully there is the gamecube

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.060 
once thankfully there is the gamecube
and<00:01:06.240> classic<00:01:06.960> controller<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.650> can<00:01:07.799> use

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
and classic controller that you can use

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.039 
and classic controller that you can use
with<00:01:08.369> this<00:01:08.549> game<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.360> makes<00:01:09.630> things<00:01:09.840> a

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
with this game and that makes things a

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.630 
with this game and that makes things a
lot<00:01:10.530> easier<00:01:10.590> one<00:01:11.220> thing<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.549> really

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
lot easier one thing that I really

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.609 
lot easier one thing that I really
didn't<00:01:12.150> like<00:01:12.270> it's<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.600> menu<00:01:12.900> system<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.350> mean<00:01:13.590> a

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
didn't like it's a menu system I mean a

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.620 
didn't like it's a menu system I mean a
lot<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.220> times<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.520> felt<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:14.880> had<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.270> guess

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
lot of times I felt that I had to guess

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.969 
lot of times I felt that I had to guess
around<00:01:16.020> what<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.320> was<00:01:16.530> supposed<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.890> be

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
around what I was supposed to be

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.219 
around what I was supposed to be
pressing<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.909> know<00:01:18.030> with<00:01:18.240> most<00:01:18.509> many<00:01:18.780> systems

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
pressing you know with most many systems

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.289 
pressing you know with most many systems
at<00:01:19.439> least<00:01:19.619> with<00:01:19.740> most<00:01:19.979> great<00:01:20.490> menu<00:01:20.759> systems

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
at least with most great menu systems

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.120 
at least with most great menu systems
you're<00:01:21.420> just<00:01:21.600> pressing<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:22.170> all<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.890> way<00:01:22.979> until

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
you're just pressing a all the way until

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.100 
you're just pressing a all the way until
you<00:01:23.369> get<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.970> know<00:01:24.060> your<00:01:24.270> first<00:01:24.420> level<00:01:24.750> but

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
you get to you know your first level but

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.480 
you get to you know your first level but
with<00:01:25.229> this<00:01:25.409> one<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.650> kind<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:25.950> have<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.130> think

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
with this one you kind of have to think

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.160 
with this one you kind of have to think
about<00:01:26.729> what<00:01:27.060> you're<00:01:27.180> going<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.390> push<00:01:27.540> next<00:01:27.990> and

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
about what you're going to push next and

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.080 
about what you're going to push next and
it's<00:01:28.290> kind<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.829> bizarre<00:01:29.009> for<00:01:29.340> me<00:01:29.369> bottom<00:01:29.939> line

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
between this game is that for me it has

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.010 
between this game is that for me it has
two<00:01:32.159> conflicting<00:01:32.490> ideas<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.240> anime<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.930> then

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
two conflicting ideas of anime and then

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.660 
two conflicting ideas of anime and then
