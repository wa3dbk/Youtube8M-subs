00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
right now if you've got a grass like a

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:45.229 
right now if you've got a grass like a
runner<00:00:43.649> like<00:00:43.950> buffalo<00:00:44.489> or<00:00:44.520> couch<00:00:44.969> or

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
runner like buffalo or couch or

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.090 
runner like buffalo or couch or
something<00:00:45.390> like<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:46.739> want<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:46.980> make

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
something like that you want to make

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.139 
something like that you want to make
sure<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.430> you're<00:00:47.550> going<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.730> dig<00:00:47.940> down

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
sure that you're going to dig down

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.330 
sure that you're going to dig down
sufficiently<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:49.530> get<00:00:49.680> rid<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.160> root

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
sufficiently to get rid of the root

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.950 
sufficiently to get rid of the root
system<00:00:50.550> because<00:00:51.000> they<00:00:51.149> can<00:00:51.360> go<00:00:51.570> down<00:00:51.780> for

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
system because they can go down for

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.779 
system because they can go down for
about<00:00:52.140> 50<00:00:52.590> ml<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.070> want<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.430> make<00:00:53.489> sure<00:00:53.579> you

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
about 50 ml so you want to make sure you

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.850 
about 50 ml so you want to make sure you
get<00:00:53.940> rid<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.390> or<00:00:55.050> ask<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.440> things<00:00:55.649> going

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
get rid of that or ask the things going

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.069 
get rid of that or ask the things going
to<00:00:55.920> keep<00:00:56.100> creeping<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:56.850> all<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.180> time<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:57.840> it's

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
to keep creeping in all the time so it's

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.900

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
if you've got like this is curved so

if you've got like this is curved so
I've<00:01:14.999> just<00:01:15.029> done<00:01:15.329> it<00:01:15.450> by<00:01:15.599> sight<00:01:15.959> but<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.859> can

00:01:17.059 --> 00:01:17.069 
I've just done it by sight but you can

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:18.980 
I've just done it by sight but you can
use<00:01:17.249> a<00:01:17.279> hose<00:01:17.609> and<00:01:17.909> all<00:01:17.999> bit<00:01:18.209> of<00:01:18.329> hose<00:01:18.509> as<00:01:18.810> well

use a hose and all bit of hose as well

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.289 
use a hose and all bit of hose as well
he<00:01:19.409> can<00:01:19.679> curve<00:01:19.920> around<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.670> move<00:01:20.849> until<00:01:21.209> you

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
he can curve around and move until you

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.149 
he can curve around and move until you
get<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.569> shape<00:01:21.749> you<00:01:21.929> want<00:01:22.079> and<00:01:22.349> then<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:23.009> can

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
get the shape you want and then you can

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.679 
get the shape you want and then you can
actually<00:01:23.279> just<00:01:23.579> use<00:01:23.639> a<00:01:23.789> few<00:01:24.060> handfuls<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.630> dirt

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
actually just use a few handfuls of dirt

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.620 
actually just use a few handfuls of dirt
or<00:01:25.109> clay<00:01:25.499> or<00:01:25.709> sand<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.399> just<00:01:26.969> run<00:01:27.329> it<00:01:27.479> along

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
or clay or sand and just run it along

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.199 
or clay or sand and just run it along
and<00:01:28.049> then<00:01:28.859> you<00:01:28.950> can<00:01:29.099> take<00:01:29.279> the<00:01:29.399> hose<00:01:29.579> away<00:01:29.819> and

00:01:30.199 --> 00:01:30.209 
and then you can take the hose away and

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:31.819 
and then you can take the hose away and
you've<00:01:30.359> got<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.539> line<00:01:30.810> where<00:01:31.349> it's<00:01:31.469> actually

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
you've got a line where it's actually

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.349 
you've got a line where it's actually
going<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.039> be<00:01:32.099> dug<00:01:32.340> out<00:01:32.520> now<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.419> first<00:01:33.599> thing

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:35.359 
going to be dug out now the first thing

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:38.389 
going to be dug out now the first thing
I've<00:01:36.359> already<00:01:36.659> dug<00:01:36.990> around<00:01:37.139> here<00:01:37.709> now<00:01:38.219> I'm

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
I've already dug around here now I'm

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:39.830 
I've already dug around here now I'm
going<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.639> be<00:01:38.729> going<00:01:38.939> straight<00:01:39.240> along<00:01:39.509> here

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
going to be going straight along here

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.059 
going to be going straight along here
now<00:01:40.169> o<00:01:40.409> matic<00:01:40.919> the<00:01:41.609> width<00:01:41.819> of<00:01:41.969> it<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.270> about<00:01:43.069> 60

00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:44.069 
now o matic the width of it is about 60

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:46.370 
now o matic the width of it is about 60
centimeters<00:01:44.579> so<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.450> actually<00:01:45.599> works<00:01:46.079> quite

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
centimeters so it actually works quite

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.260 
centimeters so it actually works quite
well<00:01:46.459> four<00:01:47.459> straight<00:01:47.700> lines<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:48.209> can

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
well four straight lines you can

dug it out so that's basically going to

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.930 
dug it out so that's basically going to
be<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.840> border<00:02:16.260> of<00:02:16.380> what<00:02:16.530> I'm<00:02:16.680> doing<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.190> then

be the border of what I'm doing and then
I'll<00:02:18.060> just<00:02:18.090> come<00:02:18.450> around<00:02:18.569> the<00:02:18.780> other<00:02:18.810> way<00:02:19.019> and

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
I'll just come around the other way and

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:35.120 
I'll just come around the other way and
I<00:02:21.630> just<00:02:21.810> dig<00:02:22.019> down<00:02:23.330> like<00:02:24.330> so<00:02:33.739> what<00:02:34.739> that<00:02:34.769> does

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
what I man so this is the bit that's

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.110 
what I man so this is the bit that's
going<00:03:30.810> to<00:03:30.900> become<00:03:31.019> a<00:03:31.230> new<00:03:31.440> garden<00:03:31.889> bed<00:03:32.100> and<00:03:32.790> let

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
going to become a new garden bed and let

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.520 
going to become a new garden bed and let
me<00:03:33.209> go<00:03:33.329> back<00:03:34.400> all<00:03:35.400> right<00:03:35.609> so<00:03:36.269> you<00:03:36.359> can<00:03:36.450> see<00:03:36.600> I've

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
me go back all right so you can see I've

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.259 
me go back all right so you can see I've
already<00:03:37.680> started<00:03:37.980> it<00:03:38.310> that's<00:03:38.910> going<00:03:39.060> to<00:03:39.150> be

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
already started it that's going to be

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:40.759 
already started it that's going to be
the<00:03:39.630> fence<00:03:39.840> line<00:03:40.019> is<00:03:40.109> going<00:03:40.260> to<00:03:40.319> be<00:03:40.380> running<00:03:40.620> a

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
the fence line is going to be running a

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.140 
the fence line is going to be running a
ride<00:03:40.980> along<00:03:41.190> there<00:03:41.459> so<00:03:41.639> it's<00:03:41.730> going<00:03:41.940> right<00:03:42.090> up

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
ride along there so it's going right up

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.660 
ride along there so it's going right up
to<00:03:42.269> the<00:03:42.450> fence<00:03:42.600> line<00:03:42.870> and<00:03:43.109> then<00:03:44.069> we're<00:03:44.310> curving

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
to the fence line and then we're curving

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.910 
to the fence line and then we're curving
around<00:03:45.109> and<00:03:46.109> it's<00:03:46.319> eventually<00:03:46.530> going<00:03:46.829> to

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
around and it's eventually going to

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.340 
around and it's eventually going to
curve<00:03:47.130> into<00:03:47.489> there<00:03:47.760> so<00:03:48.510> this<00:03:48.690> is<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:49.019> garden

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
curve into there so this is the garden

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.819 
curve into there so this is the garden
vegetable<00:03:50.160> garden<00:03:50.370> from<00:03:50.549> scratch<00:03:51.590> and<00:03:52.590> I'm

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
vegetable garden from scratch and I'm

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:55.220 
vegetable garden from scratch and I'm
basically<00:03:53.160> just<00:03:53.310> extending<00:03:54.060> it<00:03:54.209> so<00:03:54.959> I'm<00:03:55.019> just

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
basically just extending it so I'm just

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.740 
basically just extending it so I'm just
continuing<00:03:55.620> it<00:03:56.010> on<00:03:56.130> for<00:03:56.340> me<00:03:56.690> so<00:03:59.450> now<00:04:00.450> you<00:04:00.510> can

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
continuing it on for me so now you can

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.500 
continuing it on for me so now you can
see<00:04:00.959> where<00:04:01.410> I've<00:04:01.560> just<00:04:01.829> dug<00:04:02.040> it<00:04:02.190> down<00:04:03.150> from

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
see where I've just dug it down from

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.030 
see where I've just dug it down from
there<00:04:03.690> with<00:04:03.959> the<00:04:04.079> flat<00:04:04.319> part<00:04:04.500> of<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.739> medic

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
there with the flat part of the medic

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.979 
there with the flat part of the medic
and<00:04:05.639> then<00:04:05.970> I've<00:04:06.060> turns<00:04:06.329> it<00:04:06.479> around<00:04:06.600> to<00:04:06.840> like

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
and then I've turns it around to like

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.470 
and then I've turns it around to like
chip<00:04:07.259> away

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
chip away

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.220 
chip away
and<00:04:09.409> that's<00:04:09.590> how<00:04:09.680> I<00:04:09.769> get<00:04:09.980> that<00:04:10.099> edge<00:04:11.230> from

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
and that's how I get that edge from

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.229 
and that's how I get that edge from
there<00:04:12.500> so<00:04:13.310> you're<00:04:13.459> digging<00:04:13.730> you<00:04:13.819> can<00:04:13.970> see

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
there so you're digging you can see

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.900 
there so you're digging you can see
you're<00:04:15.140> really<00:04:15.170> digging<00:04:15.650> far<00:04:16.160> enough<00:04:16.370> down<00:04:16.430> so

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
you're really digging far enough down so

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.189 
you're really digging far enough down so
you<00:04:16.970> don't<00:04:17.060> have<00:04:17.269> to<00:04:17.359> worry<00:04:17.540> about<00:04:17.660> any<00:04:17.930> of<00:04:18.079> the

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:18.199 
you don't have to worry about any of the

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:24.040 
you don't have to worry about any of the
root<00:04:18.440> systems<00:04:18.859> on<00:04:19.040> the<00:04:19.160> grass<00:04:22.960> that's<00:04:23.960> the

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
root systems on the grass that's the

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.170 
root systems on the grass that's the
easiest<00:04:24.500> a<00:04:24.800> lot<00:04:25.190> of<00:04:25.220> people<00:04:25.310> build<00:04:25.880> over<00:04:26.120> the

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
easiest a lot of people build over the

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.580 
easiest a lot of people build over the
top<00:04:26.360> of<00:04:26.510> things<00:04:26.720> with<00:04:27.080> you<00:04:27.229> know<00:04:27.350> put

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
top of things with you know put

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.469 
top of things with you know put
newspaper<00:04:28.040> down<00:04:28.130> stuff<00:04:28.699> like<00:04:28.790> that<00:04:28.880> but<00:04:29.270> I

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 
newspaper down stuff like that but I

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:31.900 
newspaper down stuff like that but I
think<00:04:30.470> if<00:04:30.590> the<00:04:30.680> soil<00:04:30.919> is<00:04:31.040> good<00:04:31.130> your<00:04:31.639> best<00:04:31.820> bet

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
think if the soil is good your best bet

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.280 
think if the soil is good your best bet
is<00:04:32.120> just<00:04:32.270> to<00:04:32.389> get<00:04:32.600> rid<00:04:32.720> of<00:04:32.750> it<00:04:32.900> straight<00:04:33.260> away

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
is just to get rid of it straight away

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.140 
is just to get rid of it straight away
and<00:04:33.770> not<00:04:34.190> worry<00:04:34.400> about<00:04:34.490> trying<00:04:34.790> to<00:04:34.910> kill<00:04:35.120> it

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
and not worry about trying to kill it

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.400 
and not worry about trying to kill it
off<00:04:35.500> and<00:04:36.500> then<00:04:37.570> that's<00:04:38.570> this<00:04:38.780> that<00:04:39.050> little<00:04:39.320> bit

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
off and then that's this that little bit

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.290 
off and then that's this that little bit
of<00:04:39.440> corner<00:04:39.860> now<00:04:40.460> it's<00:04:40.610> a<00:04:40.669> nightmare<00:04:40.940> because

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
of corner now it's a nightmare because

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.840 
of corner now it's a nightmare because
as<00:04:41.570> we<00:04:41.720> haven't<00:04:41.990> had<00:04:42.080> any<00:04:42.110> rain<00:04:42.590> so<00:04:43.550> the<00:04:43.669> ground

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
as we haven't had any rain so the ground

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.730 
as we haven't had any rain so the ground
is<00:04:44.000> really<00:04:44.300> dry<00:04:44.630> so<00:04:44.990> if<00:04:45.110> you<00:04:45.229> can<00:04:45.440> if<00:04:45.650> you're

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
is really dry so if you can if you're

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.409 
is really dry so if you can if you're
not<00:04:45.830> in<00:04:45.919> the<00:04:45.979> hurry<00:04:46.190> wait<00:04:46.610> until<00:04:46.850> it<00:04:46.940> rains<00:04:47.180> and

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
not in the hurry wait until it rains and

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.480 
not in the hurry wait until it rains and
then<00:04:47.570> to<00:04:47.750> a<00:04:47.780> job<00:04:48.050> like<00:04:48.229> this<00:04:48.350> because<00:04:49.190> it'll

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
then to a job like this because it'll

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.010 
then to a job like this because it'll
think<00:04:49.760> the<00:04:49.940> water<00:04:50.120> will<00:04:50.240> seep<00:04:50.510> down<00:04:50.750> at<00:04:50.900> least

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
think the water will seep down at least

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.990 
think the water will seep down at least
a<00:04:51.169> good<00:04:51.289> if<00:04:52.010> you<00:04:52.190> get<00:04:52.310> a<00:04:52.340> good<00:04:52.490> rain<00:04:52.699> hopefully

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
a good if you get a good rain hopefully

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.230 
a good if you get a good rain hopefully
you're<00:04:53.300> getting<00:04:53.330> good<00:04:53.720> 50<00:04:54.110> mil<00:04:54.910> down<00:04:55.910> into<00:04:56.150> the

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
you're getting good 50 mil down into the

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.920 
you're getting good 50 mil down into the
ground<00:04:57.100> so<00:04:58.100> it's<00:04:58.460> a<00:04:58.550> lot<00:04:58.699> easier<00:04:58.729> this<00:04:59.449> is<00:04:59.600> dry

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
ground so it's a lot easier this is dry

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.750 
ground so it's a lot easier this is dry
as<00:04:59.990> a<00:05:00.199> bone<00:05:00.440> so<00:05:01.190> it's<00:05:01.340> really<00:05:01.550> quite<00:05:01.910> hard<00:05:03.760> now

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
as a bone so it's really quite hard now

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.670 
as a bone so it's really quite hard now
what<00:05:04.970> I'm<00:05:05.060> doing<00:05:05.090> with<00:05:05.449> all<00:05:05.600> this<00:05:05.840> once<00:05:06.530> you've

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
what I'm doing with all this once you've

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.909 
what I'm doing with all this once you've
dug<00:05:06.979> it<00:05:07.130> up<00:05:07.220> all<00:05:07.880> the<00:05:08.030> grass<00:05:08.350> don't<00:05:09.350> waste<00:05:09.590> it

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
dug it up all the grass don't waste it

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.770 
dug it up all the grass don't waste it
I'll<00:05:10.850> show<00:05:11.060> you<00:05:11.120> what<00:05:11.210> I'm<00:05:11.330> doing<00:05:11.570> with<00:05:11.630> mine<00:05:11.930> I

I'll show you what I'm doing with mine I
am<00:05:14.780> just<00:05:14.930> using<00:05:15.139> it<00:05:15.470> and<00:05:15.770> I've<00:05:15.950> got<00:05:16.130> some<00:05:16.340> in

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
am just using it and I've got some in

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:21.580 
am just using it and I've got some in
here<00:05:16.880> too<00:05:17.710> and<00:05:18.710> some<00:05:19.700> other<00:05:19.880> matter<00:05:20.240> and<00:05:20.870> I'm

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
here too and some other matter and I'm

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.350 
here too and some other matter and I'm
just<00:05:21.830> breaking<00:05:22.010> it<00:05:22.310> down<00:05:22.340> I'm<00:05:23.030> just<00:05:23.210> covering

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
just breaking it down I'm just covering

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.600 
just breaking it down I'm just covering
it<00:05:23.690> over<00:05:24.020> so<00:05:24.560> it<00:05:24.740> doesn't<00:05:25.070> really<00:05:25.160> get<00:05:25.400> a<00:05:25.460> lot

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
it over so it doesn't really get a lot

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.029 
it over so it doesn't really get a lot
of<00:05:25.669> sunlight<00:05:25.970> and<00:05:26.360> rain<00:05:26.750> and<00:05:27.710> what<00:05:27.860> have<00:05:28.010> you

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:28.039 
of sunlight and rain and what have you

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:30.400 
of sunlight and rain and what have you
and<00:05:28.340> I'll<00:05:28.910> leave<00:05:29.150> it<00:05:29.330> over<00:05:29.539> went<00:05:29.750> us<00:05:29.960> just<00:05:30.289> so

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
and I'll leave it over went us just so

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.219 
and I'll leave it over went us just so
the<00:05:30.680> grass<00:05:30.860> actually<00:05:31.400> dies<00:05:31.610> off<00:05:31.910> I'm<00:05:32.840> starting

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229 
the grass actually dies off I'm starting

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:36.879 
the grass actually dies off I'm starting
a<00:05:33.289> new<00:05:33.440> one<00:05:33.590> here<00:05:33.919> and<00:05:34.400> the<00:05:34.580> old<00:05:34.700> toys<00:05:34.940> and<00:05:35.889> then

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:36.889 
a new one here and the old toys and then

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:40.870 
a new one here and the old toys and then
have<00:05:37.580> and<00:05:38.419> then<00:05:38.830> yeah<00:05:39.830> that'll<00:05:40.190> break<00:05:40.520> down

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
have and then yeah that'll break down

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.089 
have and then yeah that'll break down
the<00:05:41.510> grasp<00:05:41.780> the<00:05:42.050> seed<00:05:42.289> itself<00:05:42.530> and<00:05:43.039> the

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:43.099 
the grasp the seed itself and the

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:44.550 
the grasp the seed itself and the
runners<00:05:43.490> and<00:05:43.669> everything<00:05:43.970> will<00:05:44.090> just<00:05:44.210> kind<00:05:44.389> of

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
runners and everything will just kind of

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.110 
runners and everything will just kind of
decomposed<00:05:45.560> and<00:05:45.950> it'll<00:05:46.490> just<00:05:46.520> become<00:05:46.729> nice

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
decomposed and it'll just become nice

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.089 
decomposed and it'll just become nice
good<00:05:47.450> organic<00:05:47.780> matter<00:05:48.139> and<00:05:48.349> then<00:05:48.889> I'll<00:05:48.979> be

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:49.099 
good organic matter and then I'll be

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:51.279 
good organic matter and then I'll be
able<00:05:49.130> to<00:05:49.280> plant<00:05:49.580> in<00:05:49.789> it<00:05:49.910> from<00:05:50.060> there<00:05:50.270> so<00:05:50.630> I'm

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:51.289 
able to plant in it from there so I'm

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:52.480 
able to plant in it from there so I'm
actually<00:05:51.440> thinking<00:05:51.830> I'm<00:05:52.070> going<00:05:52.250> to<00:05:52.340> put

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
actually thinking I'm going to put

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.610 
actually thinking I'm going to put
nasturtiums<00:05:52.820> in<00:05:53.419> those<00:05:53.690> so<00:05:54.020> we'll<00:05:54.289> see<00:05:54.440> how<00:05:54.470> we

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
nasturtiums in those so we'll see how we

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.950 
nasturtiums in those so we'll see how we
go<00:05:54.710> it's<00:05:55.430> going<00:05:55.580> to<00:05:55.610> have<00:05:55.760> ages<00:05:56.270> vernis<00:05:56.570> like

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
go it's going to have ages vernis like

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.070 
go it's going to have ages vernis like
April<00:05:57.410> now<00:05:57.590> so<00:05:57.860> sick<00:05:58.099> a<00:05:58.130> month<00:05:58.400> of<00:05:58.580> autumn<00:05:59.419> so

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 
April now so sick a month of autumn so

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.480 
April now so sick a month of autumn so
it's<00:06:00.200> got<00:06:00.349> another<00:06:00.590> month<00:06:00.860> of<00:06:01.010> autumn<00:06:01.310> then

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
it's got another month of autumn then

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.029 
it's got another month of autumn then
it's<00:06:01.580> got<00:06:01.700> all<00:06:01.910> of<00:06:02.380> winter<00:06:03.380> so<00:06:03.650> that<00:06:03.770> should<00:06:03.919> be

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:04.039 
it's got all of winter so that should be

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:05.740 
it's got all of winter so that should be
sufficient<00:06:04.190> time<00:06:04.669> for<00:06:04.729> that<00:06:05.060> to<00:06:05.210> die<00:06:05.389> off<00:06:05.570> so

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:05.750 
sufficient time for that to die off so

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:06.700 
sufficient time for that to die off so
they<00:06:05.870> have<00:06:05.990> to<00:06:06.080> worry<00:06:06.229> about<00:06:06.289> it<00:06:06.530> you<00:06:06.680> know

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
they have to worry about it you know

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.800 
they have to worry about it you know
reoccurring<00:06:07.580> arrest<00:06:08.090> I'll<00:06:08.180> just<00:06:08.330> have<00:06:08.479> a<00:06:08.510> pot

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
reoccurring arrest I'll just have a pot

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.010 
reoccurring arrest I'll just have a pot
didn't<00:06:09.169> buffalo<00:06:09.830> grass<00:06:10.039> coming<00:06:10.340> out<00:06:10.580> of<00:06:10.610> it

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
didn't buffalo grass coming out of it

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.320 
didn't buffalo grass coming out of it
cool<00:06:12.020> alright<00:06:12.650> so<00:06:13.130> I<00:06:13.160> hope<00:06:13.190> that<00:06:13.340> explains<00:06:14.120> it

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.330 
cool alright so I hope that explains it

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.180 
cool alright so I hope that explains it
properly<00:06:14.660> with<00:06:14.990> the<00:06:15.020> garden<00:06:15.530> bed<00:06:15.710> basically

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
properly with the garden bed basically

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.719 
properly with the garden bed basically
just<00:06:16.580> digging<00:06:16.969> down

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:17.729 
just digging down

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:20.179 
just digging down
use<00:06:18.330> the<00:06:18.479> mattock<00:06:18.779> flat<00:06:19.199> initially<00:06:19.800> well<00:06:20.039> this

00:06:20.179 --> 00:06:20.189 
use the mattock flat initially well this

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:22.429 
use the mattock flat initially well this
is<00:06:20.219> what<00:06:20.460> I<00:06:20.490> do<00:06:20.610> use<00:06:21.419> the<00:06:21.569> magic<00:06:21.870> and<00:06:21.990> flat

00:06:22.429 --> 00:06:22.439 
is what I do use the magic and flat

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:24.140 
is what I do use the magic and flat
initially<00:06:22.979> so<00:06:23.460> you're<00:06:23.610> just<00:06:23.759> kind<00:06:24.089> of

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150 
initially so you're just kind of

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.610 
initially so you're just kind of
creating<00:06:24.629> your<00:06:24.719> board<00:06:24.960> a<00:06:25.110> lot<00:06:25.259> once<00:06:25.499> you've

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 
creating your board a lot once you've

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.159 
creating your board a lot once you've
marked<00:06:25.830> it<00:06:26.039> out<00:06:26.189> take<00:06:26.789> down<00:06:27.089> and<00:06:27.360> then<00:06:27.839> turn<00:06:28.139> it

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:28.169 
marked it out take down and then turn it

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:30.709 
marked it out take down and then turn it
around<00:06:28.409> and<00:06:28.740> then<00:06:29.069> just<00:06:29.339> chip<00:06:29.610> it<00:06:29.789> out<00:06:29.999> see

00:06:30.709 --> 00:06:30.719 
around and then just chip it out see

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:32.360 
around and then just chip it out see
it's<00:06:30.930> like<00:06:31.020> creating<00:06:31.620> a<00:06:31.680> little<00:06:31.889> moat<00:06:32.099> and

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:32.370 
it's like creating a little moat and

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.369 
it's like creating a little moat and
then<00:06:32.939> you<00:06:33.059> can<00:06:33.240> just<00:06:33.419> cut<00:06:33.839> away<00:06:34.050> the<00:06:34.080> grass

00:06:34.369 --> 00:06:34.379 
then you can just cut away the grass

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:35.749 
then you can just cut away the grass
from<00:06:34.589> there<00:06:34.740> dig<00:06:34.979> it<00:06:35.069> out<00:06:35.159> and<00:06:35.370> then<00:06:35.400> turned

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 
from there dig it out and then turned

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:37.999 
from there dig it out and then turned
all<00:06:35.999> over<00:06:36.300> and<00:06:36.719> they'll<00:06:36.990> be<00:06:37.110> still<00:06:37.439> a<00:06:37.469> few<00:06:37.740> root

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:38.009 
all over and they'll be still a few root

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:39.890 
all over and they'll be still a few root
systems<00:06:38.520> and<00:06:38.699> that<00:06:38.819> so<00:06:39.059> just<00:06:39.180> pull<00:06:39.449> those<00:06:39.659> out

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:39.900 
systems and that so just pull those out

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.779 
systems and that so just pull those out
and<00:06:40.169> then<00:06:40.979> you<00:06:41.099> go<00:06:41.219> from<00:06:41.430> there<00:06:41.580> and<00:06:41.699> just

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:41.789 
and then you go from there and just

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:43.760 
and then you go from there and just
basically<00:06:41.939> what<00:06:42.360> I<00:06:42.389> did<00:06:42.509> with<00:06:42.809> the<00:06:43.020> vegetable

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:43.770 
basically what I did with the vegetable

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.980 
basically what I did with the vegetable
garden<00:06:43.800> from<00:06:44.249> scratch<00:06:44.550> garden<00:06:44.999> and<00:06:45.150> it's<00:06:45.809> come

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:45.990 
garden from scratch garden and it's come

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.409 
garden from scratch garden and it's come
up<00:06:46.020> quite<00:06:46.319> well<00:06:46.729> the<00:06:47.729> only<00:06:47.879> thing<00:06:48.029> have<00:06:48.150> to<00:06:48.270> do

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:48.419 
up quite well the only thing have to do

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:49.939 
up quite well the only thing have to do
with<00:06:48.449> that<00:06:48.779> is<00:06:48.990> because<00:06:49.289> it's<00:06:49.439> on<00:06:49.559> a<00:06:49.589> bit<00:06:49.770> of<00:06:49.860> an

00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:49.949 
with that is because it's on a bit of an

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:52.309 
with that is because it's on a bit of an
angle<00:06:50.159> I'm<00:06:51.059> actually<00:06:51.330> going<00:06:51.629> to<00:06:51.719> build<00:06:51.960> up<00:06:52.139> one

00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:52.319 
angle I'm actually going to build up one

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:56.269 
angle I'm actually going to build up one
side<00:06:52.680> and<00:06:53.749> get<00:06:54.749> some<00:06:54.930> soil<00:06:55.229> monster<00:06:55.860> by<00:06:56.039> some

00:06:56.269 --> 00:06:56.279 
side and get some soil monster by some

00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:58.249 
side and get some soil monster by some
soil<00:06:56.550> and<00:06:57.210> then<00:06:57.360> they<00:06:57.449> were<00:06:57.569> out<00:06:57.719> bro<00:06:57.990> so<00:06:58.139> I'm

00:06:58.249 --> 00:06:58.259 
soil and then they were out bro so I'm

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:00.529 
soil and then they were out bro so I'm
going<00:06:58.409> to<00:06:58.439> get<00:06:58.559> it<00:06:58.680> from<00:06:58.770> the<00:06:59.759> whole<00:07:00.059> build<00:07:00.389> up

00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:00.539 
going to get it from the whole build up

00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:02.689 
going to get it from the whole build up
one<00:07:00.719> side<00:07:01.020> and<00:07:01.379> then<00:07:01.710> I'll<00:07:01.949> level<00:07:02.309> it<00:07:02.430> out<00:07:02.580> so

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:02.699 
one side and then I'll level it out so

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:04.279 
one side and then I'll level it out so
it's<00:07:02.819> a<00:07:02.879> bit<00:07:03.059> more<00:07:03.240> level<00:07:03.599> so<00:07:03.719> I'm<00:07:03.779> not<00:07:03.960> having

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:04.289 
it's a bit more level so I'm not having

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:06.049 
it's a bit more level so I'm not having
to<00:07:04.349> worry<00:07:04.439> about<00:07:04.710> when<00:07:05.219> it<00:07:05.249> rains<00:07:05.610> and<00:07:05.939> that

00:07:06.049 --> 00:07:06.059 
to worry about when it rains and that

00:07:06.059 --> 00:07:08.290 
to worry about when it rains and that
did<00:07:06.210> it's<00:07:06.360> all<00:07:06.539> running<00:07:06.839> away<00:07:07.050> so<00:07:07.259> much

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:08.300 
did it's all running away so much

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.510 
did it's all running away so much
because<00:07:09.300> they<00:07:09.479> got<00:07:09.659> the<00:07:09.960> soil<00:07:10.589> so<00:07:10.919> dry<00:07:11.309> at<00:07:11.460> the

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.520 
because they got the soil so dry at the

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.420 
because they got the soil so dry at the
moment<00:07:11.580> it<00:07:12.059> really<00:07:12.360> needs<00:07:12.569> a<00:07:12.749> lot<00:07:12.899> of<00:07:13.430> compost

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:14.430 
moment it really needs a lot of compost

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:16.610 
moment it really needs a lot of compost
an<00:07:14.610> organic<00:07:15.029> manure<00:07:15.360> introduced<00:07:15.930> into<00:07:16.169> it<00:07:16.379> too

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:16.620 
an organic manure introduced into it too

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.040 
an organic manure introduced into it too
so<00:07:16.889> I<00:07:16.949> really<00:07:17.189> want<00:07:17.219> to<00:07:17.399> kind<00:07:17.580> of<00:07:17.809> bring<00:07:18.809> it<00:07:18.930> up

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:19.050 
so I really want to kind of bring it up

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:20.510 
so I really want to kind of bring it up
to<00:07:19.259> speed<00:07:19.289> because<00:07:19.770> it<00:07:19.800> hasn't<00:07:20.039> really<00:07:20.279> had

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:20.520 
to speed because it hasn't really had

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.420 
to speed because it hasn't really had
anything<00:07:20.729> in<00:07:20.939> it<00:07:21.089> and<00:07:21.240> it's<00:07:21.330> just<00:07:21.509> you<00:07:22.289> know

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:22.430 
anything in it and it's just you know

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.059 
anything in it and it's just you know
being<00:07:23.959> had<00:07:24.959> all<00:07:25.080> the<00:07:25.169> nutrients<00:07:25.620> sucked<00:07:25.889> out

00:07:26.059 --> 00:07:26.069 
being had all the nutrients sucked out

00:07:26.069 --> 00:07:27.860 
being had all the nutrients sucked out
of<00:07:26.249> it<00:07:26.339> for<00:07:26.459> so<00:07:26.729> long<00:07:27.060> it<00:07:27.300> really<00:07:27.659> needs

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:27.870 
of it for so long it really needs

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.230 
of it for so long it really needs
something<00:07:28.229> added<00:07:28.620> to<00:07:28.649> it<00:07:28.919> to<00:07:29.550> increase<00:07:29.819> it<00:07:30.089> as

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.240 
something added to it to increase it as

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.909 
something added to it to increase it as
a<00:07:30.270> growing<00:07:30.719> medium<00:07:31.110> so<00:07:31.379> we'll<00:07:31.529> see<00:07:31.649> how<00:07:31.680> we<00:07:31.830> go

00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 
a growing medium so we'll see how we go

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:34.879 
a growing medium so we'll see how we go
from<00:07:32.189> there<00:07:32.569> and<00:07:33.569> the<00:07:33.689> retaining<00:07:34.080> wall<00:07:34.379> the

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:34.889 
from there and the retaining wall the

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:36.619 
from there and the retaining wall the
easiest<00:07:35.219> thing<00:07:35.310> would<00:07:35.430> be<00:07:35.729> would<00:07:36.300> like<00:07:36.509> to

00:07:36.619 --> 00:07:36.629 
easiest thing would be would like to

00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:38.629 
easiest thing would be would like to
build<00:07:36.810> it<00:07:36.990> up<00:07:37.050> on<00:07:37.229> one<00:07:37.409> side<00:07:37.709> would<00:07:38.610> be

00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:38.639 
build it up on one side would be

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:40.820 
build it up on one side would be
sleepers<00:07:39.240> but<00:07:40.139> they<00:07:40.259> have<00:07:40.379> the<00:07:40.469> money<00:07:40.589> for

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:40.830 
sleepers but they have the money for
