hundred percent of it reverses
traditional<00:00:35.190> glooming<00:00:35.460> products<00:00:35.760> which<00:00:35.910> I've

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
traditional glooming products which I've

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.380 
traditional glooming products which I've
has<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.360> be<00:00:36.450> digested<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.200> some<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.040> gets

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
has to be digested and some of that gets

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.240 
has to be digested and some of that gets
destroyed<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.780> not<00:00:39.989> used<00:00:40.260> in<00:00:40.500> your<00:00:40.620> system<00:00:40.950> so

when you take it in you actually don't
it<00:00:55.410> actually<00:00:55.649> because<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.129> its<00:00:56.250> dipeptide

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
it actually because of its dipeptide

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.150 
it actually because of its dipeptide
structure<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.899> doesn't<00:00:58.320> require<00:00:58.440> your<00:00:58.920> body

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
structure it doesn't require your body

to<00:00:59.309> actually<00:00:59.730> digest<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.300> or<00:01:00.420> simulate<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:00.960> you

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
to actually digest it or simulate it you

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.299 
to actually digest it or simulate it you
could<00:01:01.199> put<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.559> pulls<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:01.949> right<00:01:01.980> through<00:01:02.190> the

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
could put a pulls it right through the

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.799 
could put a pulls it right through the
intestinal<00:01:02.670> tract<00:01:02.940> right<00:01:03.390> through<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.660> GI

tract<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.379> your<00:01:04.559> body<00:01:04.680> starts<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.100> use<00:01:05.309> it

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
tract and your body starts to use it

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.429 
tract and your body starts to use it
right<00:01:05.549> away<00:01:05.670> which<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:05.939> why<00:01:06.180> i<00:01:06.210> like<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.659> i<00:01:06.780> use
