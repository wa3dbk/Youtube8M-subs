 good morning I'm claudia working in 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.600
 mini- cell veterinary clinic 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.610
 varese and he knows that our model 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.400

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.500
 clean our dog's ears 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.750
 obviously remember that in case 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.970
 have a doubt that cagliari e 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.770
 otitis is always better to address to 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.489
 your veterinarian if instead 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.949
 you want to do the maintenance but the 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:39.140
 posture editing video as can be done 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:41.840
 first of all the thing that could 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.870
 be comfortable and to start a 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.450
 possible your dog from an early age 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.160
 eating me loves to read the ears 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.470
 so that it is not found 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.630
 suddenly of adulthood to be 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.430
 touched or maybe entered the net 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.320
 often they are a part I love 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.600
 annoyed and touched 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:04.600
 then I 'm going to take it as a common cream 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.600
 absolutely for hands and cotton 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:12.490
 you see a little hole of cream like that 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.970
 then take the pavilion with your finger 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:23.110
 of your dog 's average when 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:26.110
 frigerio reads you have a first prime 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:29.200
 strong obuko and it is precisely that one more 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.780
 close to understand the goodness of the dog 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.520
 that you must enter with your finger vi 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.500
 do not recommend to use all fiocca 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.479
 absolutely never said and how far 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.000
 our finger arrives means that you 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:44.860

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.770
 cotton if you hear this whine wants 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.619
 to say that to taste is not a nuisance 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.890
 evil is simply with the right 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.800
 income of the common ear that remains at 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.830
 left this way and then launch 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.420
 outside it may be that it is more minus less 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.270
 black in this case also to the ears 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.660
 clean and then our police was 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.000

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:16.720

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:20.860
