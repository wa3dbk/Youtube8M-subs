ones<00:01:38.960> one<00:01:39.960> small<00:01:40.200> step<00:01:40.409> when<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.770> first<00:01:41.009> race

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220

will<00:01:41.430> have<00:01:41.460> accents<00:01:45.320> for<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.439> success<00:01:48.350> which

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
will have accents for the success which

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:59.980 
will have accents for the success which
I<00:01:49.500> want<00:01:53.149> and<00:01:54.149> if<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.750> second<00:01:55.290> longer

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.480 

so<00:02:00.990> Need<00:02:01.530> for<00:02:01.560> Speed<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:01.979> one<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.369> few

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
so Need for Speed is one of the few

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.310 
so Need for Speed is one of the few
games<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:02.850> does<00:02:03.180> this<00:02:03.420> I'm<00:02:03.689> not<00:02:03.840> sure<00:02:03.899> how

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
games that does this I'm not sure how

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.969 
games that does this I'm not sure how
many<00:02:04.380> other<00:02:04.619> games<00:02:04.950> actually<00:02:06.680> check<00:02:07.680> things

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
many other games actually check things

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.380 
many other games actually check things
like<00:02:08.190> this<00:02:08.310> but<00:02:08.489> if<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:08.729> go<00:02:08.849> into<00:02:09.030> your<00:02:09.090> blank

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
like this but if you go into your blank

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.940 
like this but if you go into your blank
game<00:02:09.629> it<00:02:09.810> will<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:11.039> will<00:02:11.580> do<00:02:11.910> anything<00:02:12.360> if

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
game it will it will do anything if

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.120

just
thumbs<00:02:16.730> with<00:02:17.030> need<00:02:17.240> for<00:02:17.270> speed<00:02:17.660> it<00:02:17.840> seems<00:02:18.110> to

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
thumbs with need for speed it seems to

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.870 
thumbs with need for speed it seems to
