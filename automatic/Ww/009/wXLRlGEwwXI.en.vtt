more worried about what's coming around

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.249 
more worried about what's coming around
the<00:01:35.939> other<00:01:36.060> side<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.600> Sun<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.960> know<00:01:37.079> this

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
the other side of the Sun you know this

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.429 
the other side of the Sun you know this
part<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.729> its<00:01:38.729> not<00:01:38.939> as<00:01:39.090> visually<00:01:39.360> appealing<00:01:40.140> as

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
part of its not as visually appealing as

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.140 
part of its not as visually appealing as
that<00:01:40.470> mega<00:01:40.829> spot<00:01:41.100> was<00:01:41.280> coming<00:01:41.640> around<00:01:41.759> but<00:01:42.060> you

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
that mega spot was coming around but you

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.880 
that mega spot was coming around but you
can<00:01:42.329> see<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.720> active<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.530> putting

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
can see it is active and it is putting

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.530 
can see it is active and it is putting
out<00:01:43.979> coronal<00:01:44.369> mass<00:01:44.520> ejections<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.210> can<00:01:45.390> see

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
out coronal mass ejections you can see

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.170 
out coronal mass ejections you can see
that<00:01:45.720> little<00:01:45.869> blip<00:01:46.170> there<00:01:46.470> is<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:47.180> coronal

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
that little blip there is the coronal

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.240 
that little blip there is the coronal
matter<00:01:48.360> kind<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.720> shoots<00:01:48.960> outward<00:01:49.380> there<00:01:49.619> so

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
matter kind of shoots outward there so

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.620 
matter kind of shoots outward there so
we'll<00:01:50.369> have<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.610> keep<00:01:50.700> an<00:01:50.850> eye<00:01:50.970> on<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.329> folks

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
we'll have to keep an eye on this folks

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.270 
we'll have to keep an eye on this folks
this<00:01:51.810> really<00:01:52.320> may<00:01:52.439> be<00:01:52.500> taking<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.009> place<00:01:53.250> of

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
this really may be taking the place of

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.209 
this really may be taking the place of
11<00:01:53.759> 429<00:01:54.360> as<00:01:54.540> it<00:01:54.630> turns<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:55.020> limb<00:01:55.229> many<00:01:55.890> people

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
11 429 as it turns a limb many people

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.520 
11 429 as it turns a limb many people
were<00:01:56.340> scared<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.850> this<00:01:57.000> thing<00:01:57.409> yesterday<00:01:58.409> we

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
were scared of this thing yesterday we

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.289 
were scared of this thing yesterday we
saw<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.740> ton<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.250> videos<00:01:59.549> about<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.030> just

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
saw a ton of videos about it it is just

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.330 
saw a ton of videos about it it is just
a<00:02:00.420> regular<00:02:00.659> old<00:02:00.899> filament<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.860> did<00:02:02.040> erupt

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
a regular old filament and it did erupt

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.490 
a regular old filament and it did erupt
for<00:02:03.240> those<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.689> have<00:02:03.899> been<00:02:04.020> questioning

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
for those of you have been questioning

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.649 
for those of you have been questioning
it<00:02:04.649> is<00:02:04.770> not<00:02:05.009> coming<00:02:05.460> towards<00:02:05.729> Earth<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.479> is

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
it is not coming towards Earth it is

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.270 
it is not coming towards Earth it is
really<00:02:07.079> beautiful<00:02:07.290> it's<00:02:07.710> something<00:02:08.220> we

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
really beautiful it's something we

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.130 
really beautiful it's something we
haven't<00:02:08.459> seen<00:02:08.610> in<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:09.000> while<00:02:09.030> we<00:02:09.810> look<00:02:09.989> over

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
haven't seen in a while we look over

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.559 
haven't seen in a while we look over
here<00:02:10.349> on<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.619> stereo<00:02:10.950> just<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.550> be<00:02:11.670> sure<00:02:11.700> earth

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
here on the stereo just to be sure earth

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.850 
here on the stereo just to be sure earth
is<00:02:12.870> all<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.080> way<00:02:13.140> over<00:02:13.379> to<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.530> right

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
is all the way over to the right

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.620 
is all the way over to the right
so<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.100> can<00:02:14.370> see<00:02:14.520> that<00:02:14.550> none<00:02:14.880> of<00:02:14.910> this<00:02:15.090> ejected

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
so you can see that none of this ejected

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.440 
so you can see that none of this ejected
material<00:02:16.140> is<00:02:16.260> coming<00:02:16.650> out<00:02:16.800> in<00:02:16.920> our<00:02:17.070> direction

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
material is coming out in our direction

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.180 
material is coming out in our direction
now<00:02:18.450> beyond<00:02:18.750> this<00:02:18.960> folks<00:02:19.260> we<00:02:19.740> have<00:02:19.830> a<00:02:19.860> trans

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
now beyond this folks we have a trans

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.130 
now beyond this folks we have a trans
equatorial<00:02:20.880> coronal<00:02:21.360> holes<00:02:21.540> that<00:02:21.870> will<00:02:22.050> be

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
equatorial coronal holes that will be

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.960 
equatorial coronal holes that will be
facing<00:02:22.530> earth<00:02:22.860> in<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.130> couple<00:02:23.400> of<00:02:23.460> days<00:02:23.520> in<00:02:23.850> this

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
facing earth in a couple of days in this

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.690 
facing earth in a couple of days in this
magnetic<00:02:24.750> filament<00:02:25.380> just<00:02:25.770> over<00:02:26.130> top<00:02:26.400> of<00:02:26.430> it

here last thing I'm going to leave you
with<00:02:28.470> here<00:02:28.830> look<00:02:28.860> all<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.370> way<00:02:29.490> over<00:02:29.730> on<00:02:29.850> the

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
with here look all the way over on the

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.820 
with here look all the way over on the
right<00:02:30.180> you<00:02:30.360> can<00:02:30.540> see<00:02:30.570> the<00:02:31.080> solar<00:02:31.740> wind

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
right you can see the solar wind

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.680 
right you can see the solar wind
temperature<00:02:32.490> and<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.730> green<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.000> speed<00:02:33.510> and

the yellow and the density in the orange
all<00:02:35.760> jumping<00:02:36.450> up<00:02:36.570> there<00:02:36.810> at<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:36.960> end<00:02:37.170> that<00:02:37.710> is

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
all jumping up there at the end that is

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.949 
all jumping up there at the end that is
the<00:02:38.040> second<00:02:38.490> coronal<00:02:38.970> mass<00:02:39.090> ejection<00:02:39.600> impact

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
the second coronal mass ejection impact

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.150 
the second coronal mass ejection impact
that<00:02:40.080> we've<00:02:40.230> been<00:02:40.380> waiting<00:02:40.680> for<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:41.040> let's
