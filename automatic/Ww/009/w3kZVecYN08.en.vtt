00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.450 
even faster and out of all the Wii U
games<00:03:11.690> I've<00:03:11.900> played<00:03:11.930> so<00:03:12.380> far<00:03:12.620> this<00:03:12.800> is<00:03:12.860> by<00:03:13.130> far

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
games I've played so far this is by far

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.280 
games I've played so far this is by far
the<00:03:13.670> best-looking<00:03:13.970> with<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:14.540> best<00:03:14.780> graphics

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
the best-looking with the best graphics

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.710 
the best-looking with the best graphics
in<00:03:15.470> fact<00:03:15.770> up<00:03:16.010> until<00:03:16.430> now<00:03:16.670> I've<00:03:16.970> kind<00:03:17.300> of<00:03:17.510> felt

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
in fact up until now I've kind of felt

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.199 
in fact up until now I've kind of felt
that<00:03:17.840> ps3<00:03:18.590> and<00:03:18.830> Wii<00:03:18.860> U<00:03:19.160> had<00:03:19.730> comparable

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
that ps3 and Wii U had comparable

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.720 
that ps3 and Wii U had comparable
graphics<00:03:20.810> but<00:03:21.020> this<00:03:21.290> in<00:03:21.500> my<00:03:21.620> opinion<00:03:22.070> shoots

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
graphics but this in my opinion shoots

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.150 
graphics but this in my opinion shoots
above<00:03:23.150> ps3<00:03:23.900> s<00:03:23.959> capabilities<00:03:24.410> and<00:03:24.860> really

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
above ps3 s capabilities and really

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.850 
above ps3 s capabilities and really
shows<00:03:25.430> that<00:03:25.580> the<00:03:25.730> Wii<00:03:25.910> U<00:03:26.150> has<00:03:26.630> a<00:03:26.690> lot<00:03:27.140> of<00:03:27.170> hidden

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
shows that the Wii U has a lot of hidden

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.590 
shows that the Wii U has a lot of hidden
talent<00:03:28.430> in<00:03:28.580> there<00:03:28.820> that<00:03:29.060> they<00:03:29.180> haven't<00:03:29.420> even

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
talent in there that they haven't even

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.690 
talent in there that they haven't even
accessed<00:03:30.170> yet<00:03:30.410> as<00:03:30.620> soon<00:03:30.860> as<00:03:30.980> you<00:03:31.070> get<00:03:31.190> past<00:03:31.250> the

out of ten the only reason that I'm not
giving<00:04:48.580> it<00:04:48.670> a<00:04:48.760> 10<00:04:49.000> is<00:04:49.150> because<00:04:49.510> there<00:04:49.690> are

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
giving it a 10 is because there are

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.510 
giving it a 10 is because there are
times<00:04:50.050> where<00:04:50.290> the<00:04:50.410> story<00:04:50.740> just<00:04:50.980> isn't<00:04:51.370> that

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
times where the story just isn't that

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.700 
times where the story just isn't that
interesting<00:04:52.090> and<00:04:52.210> a<00:04:52.270> little<00:04:52.420> convoluted<00:04:53.170> but

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
interesting and a little convoluted but

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.680 
interesting and a little convoluted but
it's<00:04:53.860> such<00:04:54.040> a<00:04:54.070> random<00:04:54.490> complaint<00:04:55.180> in<00:04:55.390> a<00:04:55.480> game

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
it's such a random complaint in a game

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.750 
it's such a random complaint in a game
filled<00:04:56.080> with<00:04:56.260> so<00:04:56.560> much<00:04:56.800> ridiculous

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
filled with so much ridiculous

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.760 
filled with so much ridiculous
awesomeness<00:04:58.570> so<00:04:58.780> guys<00:04:58.960> since<00:04:59.110> I<00:04:59.230> am<00:04:59.380> talking

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:00.870 
awesomeness so guys since I am talking
about<00:04:59.830> something<00:05:00.190> that<00:05:00.280> I<00:05:00.520> feel<00:05:00.820> is

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
about something that I feel is

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.120 
about something that I feel is
underrated<00:05:01.600> in<00:05:01.720> the<00:05:01.870> Wii<00:05:02.020> U<00:05:02.140> system<00:05:02.410> I<00:05:02.770> thought

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
underrated in the Wii U system I thought

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.980 
underrated in the Wii U system I thought
it<00:05:03.250> might<00:05:03.340> be<00:05:03.460> cool<00:05:03.640> if<00:05:03.760> I<00:05:03.910> recommended<00:05:04.630> a<00:05:04.750> game

it might be cool if I recommended a game
that<00:05:05.260> I<00:05:05.290> also<00:05:05.650> think<00:05:05.980> is<00:05:06.100> underrated<00:05:06.520> that<00:05:06.880> is

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
that I also think is underrated that is

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.390 
that I also think is underrated that is
older<00:05:07.750> and<00:05:07.900> that<00:05:08.140> game<00:05:08.350> is<00:05:08.560> called<00:05:08.770> Shenmue
