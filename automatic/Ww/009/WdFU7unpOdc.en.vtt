00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
after we decided we didn't want to build

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.610 
after we decided we didn't want to build
a<00:00:05.670> house<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:06.270> traditional<00:00:06.960> way<00:00:07.109> with<00:00:07.589> a

livable I already have a small home on
where<00:00:14.040> you<00:00:14.130> found<00:00:14.280> some<00:00:14.519> space<00:00:14.730> for<00:00:15.089> some

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
where you found some space for some

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.140 
where you found some space for some
lofts<00:00:16.410> for<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.830> kids<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.340> then<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.760> idea<00:00:18.090> has

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
lofts for the kids and then the idea has

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.660 
lofts for the kids and then the idea has
been<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.510> build<00:00:18.840> small<00:00:19.529> earthbag<00:00:20.100> bedrooms

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
been to build small earthbag bedrooms

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.400 
been to build small earthbag bedrooms
for<00:00:20.880> each<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.240> us<00:00:21.390> that<00:00:21.600> kind<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:21.900> circle

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
for each of us that kind of circle

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.140 
for each of us that kind of circle
around<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.800> backyard<00:00:23.310> I<00:00:23.550> wouldn't<00:00:23.850> be<00:00:23.939> for

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
around the backyard I wouldn't be for

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.700 
around the backyard I wouldn't be for
this<00:00:24.240> idea<00:00:24.630> we<00:00:24.779> had<00:00:24.869> little<00:00:25.050> kids<00:00:25.260> so<00:00:25.470> we<00:00:25.590> have

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
this idea we had little kids so we have

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.500 
this idea we had little kids so we have
four<00:00:25.920> teenagers<00:00:26.310> on<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.939> other<00:00:27.060> hand<00:00:27.330> we're

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
four teenagers on the other hand we're

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.210 
four teenagers on the other hand we're
feeling<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.779> pressure<00:00:28.140> as<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.920> kids<00:00:29.130> are

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
feeling the pressure as the kids are

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.370 
feeling the pressure as the kids are
getting<00:00:29.279> older<00:00:29.490> fast<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.420> some<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.109> them<00:00:31.230> are

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
getting older fast and some of them are

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.260 
getting older fast and some of them are
still<00:00:31.590> up<00:00:31.740> in<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.890> lofts<00:00:32.160> breeze<00:00:32.759> was<00:00:33.030> done

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
still up in the lofts breeze was done

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.450 
still up in the lofts breeze was done
and<00:00:33.540> posted<00:00:33.989> on<00:00:34.110> YouTube<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.680> while<00:00:34.890> back

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
and posted on YouTube a while back

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.819 
and posted on YouTube a while back
this<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:36.030> Garen's<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:37.079> real<00:00:37.260> trick<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.559> this

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
this is Garen's the real trick to this

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.040 
this is Garen's the real trick to this
is<00:00:38.070> getting<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.550> foundations<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.510> correctly

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
is getting the foundations in correctly

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.930 
is getting the foundations in correctly
and<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.590> that's<00:00:41.340> kind<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.670> first<00:00:41.820> thing

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
and and that's kind of the first thing

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.940 
and and that's kind of the first thing
you<00:00:42.090> do<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.360> lay<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.570> out<00:00:42.690> properly<00:00:43.230> we

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
you do is you lay it out properly we

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.560 
you do is you lay it out properly we
found<00:00:44.190> in<00:00:44.399> breeze<00:00:44.700> from<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.030> layout<00:00:45.360> was

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
found in breeze from the layout was

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.270 
found in breeze from the layout was
really<00:00:46.050> important<00:00:46.469> because<00:00:46.530> once<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:46.980> got<00:00:47.129> to

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
really important because once I got to

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.770 
really important because once I got to
the<00:00:47.399> roof<00:00:48.079> that<00:00:49.079> was<00:00:49.200> kind<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:50.120> it<00:00:51.120> was<00:00:51.270> quite

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
the roof that was kind of a it was quite

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.290 
the roof that was kind of a it was quite
a<00:00:51.809> calculation<00:00:52.350> mess<00:00:52.710> for<00:00:53.039> me<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.550> hit<00:00:54.059> took<00:00:54.270> a

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
a calculation mess for me I hit took a

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.819 
a calculation mess for me I hit took a
long<00:00:54.510> time<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.840> kind<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.079> calculate<00:00:55.260> through<00:00:55.620> I

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
long time to kind of calculate through I

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.139 
long time to kind of calculate through I
put<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.039> lot<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.250> roofs<00:00:56.430> in<00:00:56.610> but<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:56.910> was<00:00:57.120> a

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
put a lot of roofs in but this was a

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:57.860 
put a lot of roofs in but this was a
challenge

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
challenge

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.750 
challenge
so<00:00:58.109> for<00:00:58.320> Garren's<00:00:58.680> we<00:00:58.859> actually<00:00:59.160> did<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.340> good

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
so for Garren's we actually did a good

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.299 
so for Garren's we actually did a good
layout<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.390> supported<00:01:00.870> in<00:01:01.260> easier<00:01:01.800> roof

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
layout that it supported in easier roof

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.759 
layout that it supported in easier roof
I<00:01:02.340> designed<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.329> different<00:01:03.629> system<00:01:03.840> for

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
I designed a different system for

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.420 
I designed a different system for
attaching<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:06.140> rafters<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.920> building

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
attaching the rafters to the building

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.870 
attaching the rafters to the building
and<00:01:08.689> works<00:01:09.689> out<00:01:09.840> much<00:01:10.020> better<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:11.250> each<00:01:11.520> kid

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
and works out much better so each kid

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.179 
and works out much better so each kid
designs<00:01:12.420> their<00:01:12.689> own<00:01:12.840> shade<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.530> only<00:01:13.950> rule

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
designs their own shade the only rule

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.550 
designs their own shade the only rule
really<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.360> they<00:01:15.750> have<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.229> keep<00:01:16.380> it

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
really is is that they have to keep it

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.130 
really is is that they have to keep it
small<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.220> bedroom<00:01:17.549> size<00:01:17.790> we<00:01:18.689> had<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.900> get<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
small the bedroom size we had to get the

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.749 
small the bedroom size we had to get the
window<00:01:19.380> frames<00:01:19.650> installed<00:01:20.130> kind<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.610> as<00:01:20.729> we

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
window frames installed kind of as we

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.820 
window frames installed kind of as we
went<00:01:21.180> so<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.509> matter<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.990> building<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.439> boxes

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
went so a matter of building the boxes

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.670 
went so a matter of building the boxes
prior<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.340> getting<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.640> frames<00:01:23.909> in<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.590> so<00:01:25.590> we

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
prior to getting the frames in and so we

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.600 
prior to getting the frames in and so we
had<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.830> calculate<00:01:26.009> for<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.460> weight

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
had to calculate for that weight

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.999 
had to calculate for that weight
calculate<00:01:27.150> for<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.360> pleats<00:01:27.829> which<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:28.979> a

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
calculate for the pleats which is a

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.289 
calculate for the pleats which is a
system<00:01:29.400> we've<00:01:29.549> talked<00:01:29.790> about<00:01:30.000> in<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.119> past

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
system we've talked about in the past

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.630 
system we've talked about in the past
about<00:01:30.630> how<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.930> connect<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:32.040> window<00:01:32.369> frames

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
about how to connect the window frames

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.789 
about how to connect the window frames
to<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.060> building<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.509> then<00:01:34.110> cleats<00:01:34.500> for

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
to the building and then cleats for

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.060 
to the building and then cleats for
hanging<00:01:35.750> other<00:01:36.750> things<00:01:37.079> inside<00:01:37.409> or<00:01:37.710> door

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
hanging other things inside or door

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.960 
hanging other things inside or door
frames<00:01:38.520> or<00:01:38.700> anything<00:01:38.759> like<00:01:39.060> that

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.240 
aura
it<00:02:02.300> is<00:02:02.450> a<00:02:02.479> combination<00:02:03.440> of<00:02:03.920> an<00:02:04.070> asphalt

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
it is a combination of an asphalt

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.540 
it is a combination of an asphalt
roofing<00:02:04.910> in<00:02:05.270> large<00:02:05.660> sheets<00:02:05.750> like<00:02:06.380> six<00:02:06.710> by<00:02:06.890> four

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
roofing in large sheets like six by four

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.490 
roofing in large sheets like six by four
they<00:02:08.179> go<00:02:08.330> on<00:02:08.450> with<00:02:08.540> long<00:02:08.720> screws<00:02:09.080> just<00:02:09.110> like

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
they go on with long screws just like

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.779 
they go on with long screws just like
you<00:02:09.619> would<00:02:09.740> put<00:02:09.770> in<00:02:10.070> metal<00:02:10.399> roofing

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
you would put in metal roofing

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.580 
you would put in metal roofing
it<00:02:11.000> went<00:02:11.209> up<00:02:11.300> really<00:02:11.480> well<00:02:11.780> we<00:02:12.110> read<00:02:12.350> good

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
it went up really well we read good

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.920 
it went up really well we read good
reviews<00:02:12.620> on<00:02:13.040> it<00:02:13.370> and<00:02:13.550> bad<00:02:13.760> reviews<00:02:14.209> on<00:02:14.510> it<00:02:14.720> but

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
reviews on it and bad reviews on it but

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.900 
reviews on it and bad reviews on it but
we<00:02:15.050> went<00:02:15.230> ahead<00:02:15.320> and<00:02:15.560> went<00:02:16.340> with<00:02:16.490> it<00:02:16.610> because

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
we went ahead and went with it because

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.730 
we went ahead and went with it because
there<00:02:17.060> were<00:02:17.150> so<00:02:17.390> many<00:02:17.510> cuts<00:02:17.840> on<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.200> roof<00:02:18.350> and

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
there were so many cuts on the roof and

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.979 
there were so many cuts on the roof and
the<00:02:19.550> metals<00:02:19.880> a<00:02:20.060> little<00:02:20.330> difficult<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:20.870> work

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
the metals a little difficult to work

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:22.840 
the metals a little difficult to work
with<00:02:21.050> and<00:02:21.440> garen<00:02:21.739> just<00:02:21.950> really<00:02:22.250> wanted<00:02:22.670> this

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
with and garen just really wanted this

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.610 
with and garen just really wanted this
softer<00:02:23.420> roofing<00:02:23.810> material<00:02:24.230> that<00:02:24.350> he<00:02:24.440> could

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
softer roofing material that he could

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.040 
softer roofing material that he could
make<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:24.950> cuts<00:02:25.160> easier<00:02:25.400> -<00:02:25.820> mm-hmm<00:02:26.480> we<00:02:26.750> try<00:02:27.020> a

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
make the cuts easier - mm-hmm we try a

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.590 
make the cuts easier - mm-hmm we try a
new<00:02:27.320> experiment<00:02:28.040> for<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.459> outside<00:02:28.880> walls<00:02:29.209> and

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
new experiment for the outside walls and

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.810 
new experiment for the outside walls and
we've<00:02:29.989> done<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.320> paper<00:02:30.530> bag<00:02:30.770> patio<00:02:31.280> and<00:02:31.610> stuff

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
we've done the paper bag patio and stuff

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.240 
we've done the paper bag patio and stuff
and<00:02:31.970> so<00:02:32.450> Garin<00:02:32.810> really<00:02:33.230> he<00:02:33.739> was<00:02:33.890> said<00:02:34.100> he

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
and so Garin really he was said he

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.650 
and so Garin really he was said he
wanted<00:02:34.550> to<00:02:34.640> try<00:02:34.820> the<00:02:34.880> paper<00:02:35.120> bag<00:02:35.360> on<00:02:35.390> the

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
wanted to try the paper bag on the

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.900 
wanted to try the paper bag on the
outside<00:02:36.140> of<00:02:36.260> his<00:02:36.380> building<00:02:36.800> first<00:02:37.400> we<00:02:37.640> tried

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
outside of his building first we tried

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.590 
outside of his building first we tried
applying<00:02:38.239> the<00:02:38.600> paper<00:02:38.840> to<00:02:39.140> the<00:02:39.170> wet<00:02:39.440> cob<00:02:40.600> it

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
applying the paper to the wet cob it

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.650 
applying the paper to the wet cob it
didn't<00:02:41.930> stick<00:02:42.200> to<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.470> cob<00:02:42.709> like<00:02:43.010> we<00:02:43.220> hoped

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
didn't stick to the cob like we hoped

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.240 
didn't stick to the cob like we hoped
looks<00:02:44.660> like<00:02:44.840> it's<00:02:45.020> just<00:02:45.380> really<00:02:45.620> good<00:02:45.950> here

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
looks like it's just really good here

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.699 
looks like it's just really good here
there's<00:02:46.489> a<00:02:46.580> little<00:02:46.910> bit<00:02:47.060> of<00:02:47.110> we<00:02:48.110> try<00:02:48.470> a

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
there's a little bit of we try a

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.620 
there's a little bit of we try a
different<00:02:49.010> finish<00:02:49.430> this<00:02:50.030> time<00:02:50.299> we<00:02:50.450> use

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
different finish this time we use

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.120 
different finish this time we use
linseed<00:02:50.959> oil<00:02:51.230> which<00:02:51.620> is<00:02:51.769> what<00:02:51.950> you<00:02:52.040> would

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
linseed oil which is what you would

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.310 
linseed oil which is what you would
typically<00:02:52.489> use<00:02:52.610> on<00:02:53.000> a<00:02:53.030> cob<00:02:53.299> floor<00:02:53.630> and<00:02:53.870> so<00:02:54.200> we

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
typically use on a cob floor and so we

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.350 
typically use on a cob floor and so we
figured<00:02:54.680> since<00:02:54.950> it<00:02:55.250> was<00:02:55.370> paper<00:02:55.610> that<00:02:56.060> it<00:02:56.180> also

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
figured since it was paper that it also

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.330 
figured since it was paper that it also
would<00:02:56.630> take<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:56.989> linseed<00:02:57.350> really<00:02:57.709> well<00:02:57.920> and

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
would take the linseed really well and

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.190 
would take the linseed really well and
we<00:02:58.489> added<00:02:58.700> some<00:02:58.880> stain<00:02:59.330> first<00:02:59.750> over<00:03:00.049> here

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
we added some stain first over here

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.080 
we added some stain first over here
common<00:03:00.620> after<00:03:00.799> deciding<00:03:01.489> to<00:03:01.640> go<00:03:01.790> with<00:03:02.000> the

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
common after deciding to go with the

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.570 
common after deciding to go with the
paper<00:03:02.360> bag<00:03:02.660> walls<00:03:02.989> we<00:03:03.500> begin<00:03:03.890> by<00:03:04.070> filling<00:03:04.370> in

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
paper bag walls we begin by filling in

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.180 
paper bag walls we begin by filling in
the<00:03:04.670> gaps<00:03:04.989> then<00:03:05.989> we<00:03:06.170> knock<00:03:06.350> down<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.830> excess

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
the gaps then we knock down the excess

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.780 
the gaps then we knock down the excess
cop<00:03:07.489> to<00:03:07.880> create<00:03:08.239> a<00:03:08.390> smooth<00:03:08.870> surface<00:03:09.470> we<00:03:10.459> apply

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
cop to create a smooth surface we apply

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.610 
cop to create a smooth surface we apply
a<00:03:10.820> sealer<00:03:11.360> next<00:03:11.780> which<00:03:12.110> helps<00:03:12.440> tremendously

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
a sealer next which helps tremendously

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.740 
a sealer next which helps tremendously

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
Reverse to blow dust on it it had a tech

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.850 
Reverse to blow dust on it it had a tech
a<00:04:30.880> sticky<00:04:31.300> texture<00:04:31.660> to<00:04:31.960> it<00:04:31.990> so<00:04:32.320> if<00:04:32.440> you<00:04:32.530> blew<00:04:32.740> to

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
a sticky texture to it so if you blew to

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.980 
a sticky texture to it so if you blew to
us<00:04:32.950> on<00:04:33.190> hips<00:04:33.700> actually<00:04:34.479> I<00:04:34.630> would<00:04:34.810> actually

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
us on hips actually I would actually

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.650 
us on hips actually I would actually
stick<00:04:35.530> more<00:04:35.740> of<00:04:35.830> a<00:04:35.889> satin<00:04:36.250> look<00:04:36.400> now<00:04:36.639> so<00:04:37.030> so

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
stick more of a satin look now so so

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.420 
stick more of a satin look now so so
even<00:04:38.080> less<00:04:38.349> than<00:04:38.530> that<00:04:38.590> so<00:04:38.919> looks<00:04:39.039> great

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
even less than that so looks great

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.070 
even less than that so looks great
yeah<00:04:39.639> and<00:04:39.849> eventually<00:04:40.330> if<00:04:40.510> that's<00:04:40.810> what<00:04:40.990> it

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
yeah and eventually if that's what it

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.750 
yeah and eventually if that's what it
would<00:04:41.139> look<00:04:41.320> like<00:04:41.380> we<00:04:41.710> just<00:04:41.740> heard<00:04:42.250> you<00:04:42.460> longer
