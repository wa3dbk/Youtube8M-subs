00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.860
 the day starts early for motorbike tv commentator in jama but to battle 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:10.949
 eric somewhere 

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:14.639
 at half past six and he is already in the car from the rear corner 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.470
 lightsvoorde and then it goes to Amsterdam in the direction of Schiphol 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.980
 where he works time the yamaguchi 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.679
 at the yamaha in new york headquarters 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:26.869
 crowds on the road Alkmaar somewhere that is used to 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.540
 he has been working at yamaha since 2009 and of course spent years on that before 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.819
 high level but before the thought really starts 

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:38.090
 it starts with a 10 km walk 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.550
 to get up to temperature somewhere in five 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.920
 once Dutch champion in the 125 cc and mx2 class 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.929
 he stopped racing in 2009 

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:51.649
 but eventually came back in the race in 2011 in the mx2 class hehe high 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:52.960
 level in the Netherlands 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.560
 last year I became third 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.340
 it is not necessary for him 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.200
 to participate as a test rider in competitions 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.620
 nice walk to 5 and 10 kilometers to 46 minutes 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.830
 work 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.220
 of course the match is such u 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.860
 not necessary 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.360
 he wants his freedom is not a must for his own 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.390
 in front of 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.740
 especially to one of the activities to ourselves but with 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.310
 its value 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.909
 marijn i do not deny that it is a very good extension of all 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:26.070
 activities 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.330
 the boys could go out of it for days 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.540
 for the first time it is sometimes good to do things in the competition 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.800
 but for guidance an angel is gone as well as if someone is standing in front of the class 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.530
 anyone who can participate in it themselves 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.530
 we are very excited about the extension but absolutely not a must 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.620
 He did say he was an important drop if you play those matches 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.780
 seems that you are doing it as safely as possible 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.110
 so that means that you have to be okay with physical warfare 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.350
 yes and that is 6 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.120
 when only homework it's just 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.480
 decision absolutely not nice if your husband or five I am there one must then yes 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.310
 before I go to work the team of coach arjan 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.840
 he simply pointed us 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.890
 not much time left as a trader in Amsterdam 

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:14.809
 then there is another challenge for somewhere in the dutch championship 

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:19.079
 so in the mx2 with a 250 cc four-stroke yamaha 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:22.799
 he comes back in the campaigns but for the fire letter from valkenswaard and then 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:23.899
 he takes the placement 

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:27.409
 of the injured herjan brakke and he does not do that every four and a half years 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:30.409
 but from slices but on a two and a half 2 stroke 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:36.109
 Something is better somewhere because of this the tests are and then it is all 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:39.099
 a bit of a true start from 0 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:41.779
 always been strong rebellion 

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:45.179
 hard jobs can have a bit more trouble but valkenswaard is nevertheless 

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:46.919
 actually considers 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:50.119
 must be such a job 

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:53.679
 what we have quietly delivered the time 4 with the two and a half hours ma 

00:02:58.229 --> 00:03:01.229
 but we had to see its usefulness 

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:03.159
 compared with 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:05.480
 with the setting that is the standard 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.539
 it had to be a considerable step harder 

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:10.929
 yes partly because the robbers were on the other hand a decent one 

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:15.790
 jump mechanisms 3 9 and yes even with that surface is sandy 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.920
 but not really really really very deeply 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:29.319
 she will of course challenge for the chance to last two and a half months 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.749
 to do 

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:33.289
 machine that really should have the test of heavy circuits and then hope 

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:36.289
 for him on the euro circuit in valkenswaard 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:39.809
 the job will be 

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:43.739
 it will not be easy to know also the steal of katy a beesie 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.919
 manager ten times world champion 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:49.469
 what does he think of the chances of somewhere in valkenswaard 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:58.840
 how many parade that will perform will rise to pick up after that backlog 

00:03:58.839 --> 00:04:02.159
 their office fans already made it difficult for a trail 

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:07.909
 if you if you keep counting in the running for years I will keep it all 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:11.009
 art to make what he thinks striking 

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:16.009
 not like attack, therefore, the hands are already full by a factor of the majority 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:18.719
 help it be heavy in suits 

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:21.719
 It makes me pick up 

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:24.449
 two million customers annually 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:27.240
 Jeffrey Herlings tends the other way 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.990
 Utrecht and Cindy and I are class 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.729
 yes I am you a connoisseur two riders simply give just think of marwijk 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.199
 harlem and hydraulic engineering of the alps 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:42.919
 he tells what is going on, she is released, it becomes very beautiful 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:45.300
 be separated from her husband 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.699
 think there has managed to double to 8 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.419
 I think he has been eating for seventeen years 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:54.550
 it all belongs to a stop I punish this weekend then 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.779
 now I have no regrets but become more attractive 

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:02.259
 oudenburg restricted 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:05.580
 and then the steering race ended the second day of Easter 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.840
 during training during the qualifying race was on something 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.900
 two and a half months of June took the number they deliver 70 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.449
 22nd in the 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:16.499
 qualifier so just behind Marc de Reuver 

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:19.689
 ride with an adolescent 714 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:23.529
 but I already noticed that it was pretty hard on this circuit 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:27.869
 decent hard surface due to the low temperatures that was inconvenient to it 

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:29.319
 really come along 

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:32.669
 lies top men and also with the men who went for the points 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:36.790
 I come here in 2000 a Saint Nicholas first newspaper that also became third in that year 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:40.210
 championship here we see together with marc de reuver 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.879
 In the end he doesn't make it to me 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:45.879
 the finish in that first race 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:50.389
 the difficult match for the fans 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:53.189
 on those two taxes 

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:56.189
 it appears that he is not completely okay physically 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.009
 he had no is not in the match and will also withdraw from the second 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:02.869
 race 

00:06:02.869 --> 00:06:06.189
 what exactly is his reading about the weekend 

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:10.069
 there is a message in the competition especially the message that there is probably 

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:13.069
 was not 100 percent fit 

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:18.740
 after the actual well the sun actually landed Monday in this case not 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:19.250
 justly 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.110
 yes did not go well 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.340
 I think especially considering my and my age I need I just 100 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.229
 percent fit are free 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:31.759
 6 and also in such a competition and especially with them the 52 pair between them 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:34.759
 from heavy machinery years I thought it was a given moment 

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:40.150
 it no longer felt safe on the road driving some have big ones 

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:41.219
 made mistakes 

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:44.610
 yes and then try it anyway i think it is one 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.379
 Yes that 

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:48.599
 I didn't have that 

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:51.159
 it was not found to be 100 percent fit 

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:53.149
 yes to any two beautiful security
