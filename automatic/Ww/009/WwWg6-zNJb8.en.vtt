flat<00:02:05.399> iron<00:02:05.610> here<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.240> you're<00:02:06.719> going<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:06.899> hold

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
flat iron here and you're going to hold

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.559 
flat iron here and you're going to hold
your<00:02:07.290> comb<00:02:07.560> here<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.160> you're<00:02:08.280> going<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.729> pull

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
your comb here and you're going to pull

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.240 
your comb here and you're going to pull
the<00:02:09.750> flat<00:02:09.989> iron<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.590> comb<00:02:10.770> at<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.039> same

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
the flat iron and the comb at the same

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.070 
the flat iron and the comb at the same
time<00:02:11.550> you're<00:02:12.060> going<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.209> use<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.510> small<00:02:12.780> teeth

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
time you're going to use the small teeth

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.850 
time you're going to use the small teeth
of<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.379> comb

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
of the comb

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.980 
of the comb
and<00:02:14.010> that's<00:02:14.460> going<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:14.820> help<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.210> pull

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
and that's going to help to pull

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.800 
and that's going to help to pull
anything<00:02:16.520> that's<00:02:17.520> tangled<00:02:18.120> you<00:02:18.180> ever<00:02:18.360> flat<00:02:18.600> on

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
anything that's tangled you ever flat on

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:19.910 
anything that's tangled you ever flat on
your<00:02:18.840> hair<00:02:19.050> without<00:02:19.170> a<00:02:19.320> comb<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:19.740> you<00:02:19.800> got

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
your hair without a comb and you got

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.040 
your hair without a comb and you got
little<00:02:20.130> tangles<00:02:20.670> that<00:02:20.730> it's<00:02:21.120> hard<00:02:21.360> as<00:02:21.570> heck<00:02:21.870> to

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
little tangles that it's hard as heck to

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.290 
little tangles that it's hard as heck to
get<00:02:22.170> out<00:02:22.320> well<00:02:23.040> if<00:02:23.160> you<00:02:23.280> use<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.610> comb<00:02:23.880> with<00:02:24.120> it

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
get out well if you use the comb with it

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.050 
get out well if you use the comb with it
and<00:02:24.590> let<00:02:25.590> that<00:02:25.800> comb<00:02:26.040> against<00:02:26.430> that<00:02:26.550> Flatiron

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
and let that comb against that Flatiron

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.820 
and let that comb against that Flatiron
and<00:02:27.270> pull<00:02:27.480> at<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.780> same<00:02:27.810> time<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.620> hair<00:02:28.770> is

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
and pull at the same time the hair is

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.710 
and pull at the same time the hair is
going<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.070> be<00:02:29.130> beautifully<00:02:29.790> straight<00:02:30.150> and

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
going to be beautifully straight and

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.690 
going to be beautifully straight and
sometimes<00:02:31.200> depending<00:02:31.650> on<00:02:31.800> your<00:02:31.890> Flatiron<00:02:32.190> and

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
sometimes depending on your Flatiron and

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.550 
sometimes depending on your Flatiron and
if<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:33.210> got<00:02:33.330> good<00:02:33.570> skills<00:02:33.900> you<00:02:34.230> can<00:02:34.380> do<00:02:34.470> it

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
if you got good skills you can do it

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.160 
if you got good skills you can do it
with<00:02:34.680> one<00:02:34.860> pass<00:02:35.180> well<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.660> problem<00:02:37.050> with

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
with one pass well the problem with

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.500 
with one pass well the problem with
what's<00:02:37.740> not<00:02:38.040> using<00:02:38.460> a<00:02:38.550> heat-resistant<00:02:39.240> comb

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
what's not using a heat-resistant comb

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.350 
what's not using a heat-resistant comb
is<00:02:39.900> that<00:02:40.560> because<00:02:41.280> that<00:02:41.520> flat<00:02:41.790> iron<00:02:42.060> is<00:02:42.150> hot

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
is that because that flat iron is hot

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.120 
is that because that flat iron is hot
and<00:02:42.600> that<00:02:42.660> comb<00:02:42.960> is<00:02:43.110> butted<00:02:43.440> up<00:02:43.560> against<00:02:44.040> the

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
and that comb is butted up against the

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.600 
and that comb is butted up against the
Flatiron<00:02:44.670> it<00:02:45.000> will<00:02:45.780> melt<00:02:46.200> that<00:02:46.650> comb<00:02:47.070> I<00:02:47.370> have

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
Flatiron it will melt that comb I have

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.200 
Flatiron it will melt that comb I have
melted<00:02:47.850> on<00:02:48.150> many<00:02:48.450> combs<00:02:49.070> doing<00:02:50.070> that<00:02:50.280> and<00:02:50.580> not

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
melted on many combs doing that and not

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.100 
melted on many combs doing that and not
because<00:02:51.540> I<00:02:51.570> didn't<00:02:51.840> know<00:02:51.930> about

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
because I didn't know about

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.380 
because I didn't know about
heat-resistant<00:02:52.830> combs<00:02:53.070> but<00:02:53.460> because<00:02:53.820> I<00:02:54.120> just

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
heat-resistant combs but because I just

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.660 
heat-resistant combs but because I just
either<00:02:55.200> didn't<00:02:55.560> have<00:02:55.590> one<00:02:55.890> near<00:02:56.160> me<00:02:56.310> or<00:02:56.490> just

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
either didn't have one near me or just

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:57.620 
either didn't have one near me or just
trying<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:56.850> hurry<00:02:57.060> up<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.270> get<00:02:57.390> something

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
trying to hurry up and get something

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.760 
trying to hurry up and get something
done<00:02:57.960> and<00:02:59.720> that's<00:03:00.720> what<00:03:00.930> happened<00:03:01.380> I<00:03:01.500> just

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
done and that's what happened I just

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.430 
done and that's what happened I just
fail<00:03:02.520> to<00:03:02.910> use<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.540> right<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.870> proper<00:03:04.200> tools

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
fail to use the right the proper tools

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.160 
fail to use the right the proper tools
so<00:03:05.310> what<00:03:05.550> this<00:03:05.760> is<00:03:06.150> and<00:03:06.510> they<00:03:06.570> usually<00:03:06.780> come<00:03:06.960> in

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
so what this is and they usually come in

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.720 
so what this is and they usually come in
gray<00:03:07.500> every<00:03:07.800> once<00:03:07.980> a<00:03:08.100> while<00:03:08.130> that<00:03:08.460> you<00:03:08.490> may

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
gray every once a while that you may

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.970 
gray every once a while that you may
have<00:03:08.970> I<00:03:09.330> think<00:03:09.750> ten<00:03:10.050> or<00:03:10.410> some<00:03:10.710> different

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
have I think ten or some different

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.340 
have I think ten or some different
colors<00:03:11.310> but<00:03:11.970> this<00:03:12.240> you<00:03:12.450> can<00:03:12.600> get<00:03:12.720> from<00:03:12.870> Sally's

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
is it is a heat resistant comb you can

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.020 
is it is a heat resistant comb you can
use<00:03:16.530> this<00:03:16.740> comb<00:03:17.040> but<00:03:17.370> it<00:03:17.520> up<00:03:17.640> against<00:03:18.000> the

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
comb is thebomb.com and the hum oh that

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.390 
comb is thebomb.com and the hum oh that
was<00:03:29.040> corny<00:03:29.250> and<00:03:29.550> then<00:03:30.209> it<00:03:30.989> will<00:03:31.230> they<00:03:32.130> weren't

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
was corny and then it will they weren't

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.010 
was corny and then it will they weren't
what<00:03:32.610> they<00:03:32.850> weren't<00:03:33.060> great<00:03:33.209> if<00:03:33.510> you<00:03:33.870> like

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
what they weren't great if you like

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.810 
what they weren't great if you like
cutting<00:03:34.380> with<00:03:34.590> these<00:03:34.770> types<00:03:35.070> of<00:03:35.250> combs<00:03:35.489> is

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
cutting with these types of combs is

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.370 
cutting with these types of combs is
nothing<00:03:36.180> but<00:03:36.270> a<00:03:36.330> hair<00:03:36.540> cutting<00:03:36.780> comb<00:03:37.050> but<00:03:37.230> it's

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
nothing but a hair cutting comb but it's

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.650 
nothing but a hair cutting comb but it's
heat<00:03:37.560> resistant<00:03:38.130> so<00:03:38.580> I<00:03:38.910> use<00:03:39.090> them<00:03:39.270> for<00:03:39.480> cutting

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
heat resistant so I use them for cutting

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.620 
heat resistant so I use them for cutting
sometimes<00:03:40.260> too<00:03:40.620> but<00:03:40.860> this<00:03:41.610> is<00:03:41.910> a<00:03:42.390> heat

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
sometimes too but this is a heat

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.120 
sometimes too but this is a heat
resistant<00:03:43.110> comb<00:03:43.320> and<00:03:43.470> again<00:03:43.709> you<00:03:43.830> can<00:03:44.010> get

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
resistant comb and again you can get
