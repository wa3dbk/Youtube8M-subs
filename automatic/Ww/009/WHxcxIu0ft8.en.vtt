 channel for current reviews dying 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.720
 light came out at the end of January of this year at 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.710
 my hands reached him just now 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.380
 initially people asked at all 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.200
 consider the game in the category got to the bottom but 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.230
 I didn’t get too easy 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.730
 Equal to me, I'm going to fall for a bachelorette party 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:42.540
 14-year-old girls will be very 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.340
 but just for a long time in terms of life, I do not 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.309
 played dying light for so long because 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.260
 There are no because there were a lot of things I 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.690
 initially skeptical of any 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.149
 games with zombie-like setting on 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.690
 toys like thighs and earth 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.850
 Other I do not even, they just do not give a shit 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.710
 worthy of being downloaded from torrents all 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.199
 because I brought up good traditions 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.840
 you were born the tree is the game where the nut is from 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.490
 stresses are compressed so that the half-legs 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.049
 stick together and then their only 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.260
 surgical methods can 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.299
 disassociate in current survival horror 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.640
 to this is no longer all zombie action games 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.350
 created primarily for hamsters give 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.270
 a bunch of bots with Russian motor skills and 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.670
 giant arsenal of weapons to spectacular 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.580
 kill all this biomass nickname stealth and 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.860
 even more God forbid fears we go 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.140
 can not even the number of such moronic 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.020
 projects I'm not losing a minute 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.150
 He counted dying light and recently one 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.180
 very kind soul drove account with 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.670
 this game on playstation 4 i thought well 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.340
 okay why not play and do everything 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.680
 Equal nothing especially on the shoulders and was 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.770
 very pleasantly surprised no i won't 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.290
 yelling that 10 out of 10 best game ever shut 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.630
 up and take my money in fact mayda to no 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.909
 by no means do we deal with just 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.979
 very nice turn without a game 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.619
 delight without onanism fanaticism and 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.210
 things just a very good game you 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.729
 you can argue that you are just saying 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.220
 dirled it he praise dying light now 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.890
 what's wrong with you d-dai lanton 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.140
 understand or too much for school I 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.300
 Now I don't insult schoolchildren 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.830
 schoolchildren have slightly different preferences 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.020
 in games for this audience rate 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.450
 done on showy gameplay but not on 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.700
 the plot is not on the atmosphere not on the graphon not on 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.740
 setting is on the gameplay everything 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.319
 listed there was very dull yes and 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.420
 gameplay well, so it is not very and 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.790
 on top of everything else weak not 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.520
 heartfelt music is implausible 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.170
 the atmosphere is my opinion techland is 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.300
 developers Dan Island they are 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.580
 developers dying light clouds absolutely 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.500
 all dyland ride mistakes cut out from there 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.330
 all the casual shit added 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.610
 nice music 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.930
 atmosphere and perspective on the gaming world 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.000
 you will soon understand why 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.820
 promising and turned out good 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.860
 Of course there is enough govnish in the game. 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.870
 only worth the texture at times they are on 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.820
 koldy level you can imagine how all 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.070
 sad but I don't even want to 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.590
 pay attention here is nothing 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.959
 how far cry 4 by the way games but very between 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.140
 like themselves yes by itself kirat grafon 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.090
 carry a hundred times more but involuntarily in 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.580
 head constantly kept comparing between 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.920
 these two games system open-world yes 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.540
 well, almost identical to run 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.310
 collect a bunch of crap something out of it 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.260
 do but in dying light it all 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.790
 implemented clearly better headlights edge you 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.130
 doing to pass the game on a hundred 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.940
 percent get symbolic achivki 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:32.190
 after some time ripping off posters 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.799
 the torsion of the drums finding the masks already 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.959
 starts this shit nauseous here everything 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.150
 otherwise crafting system to madness 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.579
 primitive but interesting wants you 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.350
 collect parts ingredients for the mixture 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:45.780
 incendiary which is really bad 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.700
 this is the skill leveling system she 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.500
 Precision Headlamp Edge Heap 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.690
 useless skills that you 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.000
 you open with difficulty and do not use 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.340
 Generally dying light is unusual for 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.920
 of our time is quite difficult in 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.720
 passage plan which is very strange in 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.910
 some places without game age 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.040
 It will be difficult for the person who first came to 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.750
 game measure and never pass i already 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.519
 experienced the pleasure of passing 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.769
 dying light on stream by the way it was 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:14.070
 My first game that went online 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:17.100
 and the last dozens of people writing i 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:19.229
 rakat bottom moron I understand 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.970
 that schoolchildren are the highest race who managed 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.340
 unleash the potential of the human brain 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.530
 one hundred percent therefore every schoolboy 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.570
 any absolute difficulty game about 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.610
 walks in the evening while doing time 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.220
 algebra meet someone her mother 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.260
 shout political posts okay that's it 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.700
 the jokes are actually this small fag 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.110
 ran it on y tube and now rub 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.690
 cocaine tru gamers 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.910
 retracted clearly dying light casual 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.460
 can be called but half 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.320
 example retarded minimap where dots 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.760
 marked where to go this in all 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.340
 modern games and it's damn 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.110
 annoying otherwise everything as it should 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.260
 happy weapon does not recover 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.180
 breaks down fatigue appears in general then 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.820
 it is sometimes difficult to play not from 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.860
 lungs or i'm just a lowered inhabitant 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.290
 sea ​​depths of sky and limbs 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.630
 which is up to some degree true but 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.460
 about some kind of hardcore game is silent 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.900
 also not worth bad about this game and 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.550
 I don't want to say anything at all because 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.470
 that I didn't even try to find any 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.210
 it is flawed despite the fact that sometimes it is not easy 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.590
 conspicuous is not the only thing 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.500
 really vybeshivaet 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.840
 this is the death of the lower boevka to beat with a pickaxe 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.120
 head a thousand times and nothing at all to the enemy 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.220
 there are no tiny shurikens 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.950
 beat off with knives you manage 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.840
 grab on scham while you yourself give 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.830
 this is equivalent to the exchange system 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.570
 fucked by us 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.090
 the only thing that annoys the game is 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.400
 bohiku nothing else remember i'm at the very 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:41.220
 early mentioned the potential of the game that i'm under 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.030
 this meant fashion, I personally think that 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.460
 dying light 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.620
 it is almost the ideal platform for 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.630
 creative craftsmen at this 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.150
 moment here is unlimited space for 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:53.340
 fantasies for the next words i can 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.530
 whip off a wave of shit 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.110
 but the side is dying light 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:00.750
 make the stalker even better of course not by 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.789
 the plot but the gameplay is certainly very 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.890
 disappointed by the complete absence of horror 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:06.510
 in such an oppressive atmosphere as in the game 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.400
 there is the strongest foundation for 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.780
 full survivor horror 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.660
 but in fact turned out some 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.789
 action-adventure steel anyway 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.380
 the river would you sword and with not smeared any 

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:18.930
 Resident Evil Zombie Game 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.789
 causes sincere nausea feeling dying 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.800
 light is the first game for so long 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:24.990
 a time from which I did not want 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.729
 puke together look at the charts 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.860
 sales that the toy came to the people by 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:31.350
 great sales to taste means there is 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.270
 hope for a sequel to the same dying light 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:36.090
 this is the only place in the world where to me 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:38.540
 rolls up hot babes just a little and 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:40.490
 rotted but it's all the little things 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:43.070
 this horse in the mouth do not look at it 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:46.490
 all write me your opinion about the toy in 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:48.080
 comments also subscribe to my 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.300
