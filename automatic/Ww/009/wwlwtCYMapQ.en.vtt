00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
yourself I personally don't recommend it

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.980 
yourself I personally don't recommend it
unless<00:01:47.250> it's<00:01:47.670> roots<00:01:47.970> because<00:01:48.450> that's<00:01:48.630> super

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
unless it's roots because that's super

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.859

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.319 
everything
so<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:58.070> hijack<00:01:59.070> one<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.340> my<00:01:59.430> friends<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.090> help<00:02:00.180> me

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
so I hijack one of my friends to help me

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.209 
so I hijack one of my friends to help me
kind<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.170> works<00:02:01.320> out<00:02:01.469> we<00:02:01.590> do<00:02:01.740> each<00:02:01.860> other's

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
kind of works out we do each other's

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.319 
kind of works out we do each other's
color<00:02:02.670> but<00:02:04.340> probably<00:02:05.340> between<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.909> two<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.119> us

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
color but probably between the two of us

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.029 
color but probably between the two of us
we<00:02:07.290> go<00:02:07.469> through<00:02:07.799> about<00:02:08.099> four<00:02:09.030> pairs<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:09.450> gloves

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
we go through about four pairs of gloves

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.250 
we go through about four pairs of gloves
per<00:02:11.039> person

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
per person

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.729 
per person
just<00:02:12.799> because<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:14.900> get<00:02:15.080> hungry<00:02:15.260> while<00:02:15.560> you're

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
just because you get hungry while you're

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.080 
just because you get hungry while you're
doing<00:02:15.950> it<00:02:16.040> or<00:02:16.129> whatever<00:02:16.250> you<00:02:16.579> wind<00:02:16.760> up<00:02:16.879> taking

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
doing it or whatever you wind up taking

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.569 
doing it or whatever you wind up taking
it<00:02:17.329> off<00:02:17.450> and<00:02:17.750> you<00:02:17.840> give<00:02:17.989> it<00:02:18.140> back<00:02:18.349> on<00:02:18.560> anyway

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:19.579 
it off and you give it back on anyway

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:21.850 
it off and you give it back on anyway
I'm<00:02:19.640> I'm<00:02:20.599> also<00:02:20.750> I'm<00:02:21.140> not<00:02:21.200> going<00:02:21.500> to<00:02:21.560> show<00:02:21.799> you

this<00:02:22.069> but<00:02:22.400> I<00:02:22.519> also<00:02:22.730> use<00:02:23.120> a<00:02:23.360> glass<00:02:23.629> pyrex<00:02:23.959> bowl

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
this but I also use a glass pyrex bowl

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.640 
this but I also use a glass pyrex bowl
and<00:02:25.000> a<00:02:26.000> pot<00:02:26.239> big<00:02:26.540> enough<00:02:26.569> to<00:02:26.989> float<00:02:27.230> that<00:02:27.409> bowl

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
and a pot big enough to float that bowl

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.520 
and a pot big enough to float that bowl
in<00:02:27.920> about<00:02:28.610> two<00:02:28.879> to<00:02:29.030> three<00:02:29.060> inches<00:02:29.269> of<00:02:29.659> low

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
in about two to three inches of low

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.119 
in about two to three inches of low
boiling<00:02:30.829> water<00:02:31.220> so<00:02:32.230> you<00:02:33.230> want<00:02:33.440> to<00:02:33.530> avoid<00:02:33.829> any

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129 
boiling water so you want to avoid any

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.430 
boiling water so you want to avoid any
kind<00:02:34.310> of<00:02:34.519> metals<00:02:34.970> I'm<00:02:35.480> not<00:02:35.720> sure<00:02:35.989> about<00:02:36.200> the

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
kind of metals I'm not sure about the

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.839 
kind of metals I'm not sure about the
chemistry<00:02:36.769> on<00:02:36.860> that<00:02:37.099> but<00:02:37.310> let's<00:02:37.579> does

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
chemistry on that but let's does

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.940 
chemistry on that but let's does
recommend<00:02:38.390> that<00:02:38.480> you<00:02:38.599> don't<00:02:38.930> use<00:02:39.079> any<00:02:39.590> metal

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
recommend that you don't use any metal

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.410 
recommend that you don't use any metal
spoons<00:02:40.400> or<00:02:40.760> bowls

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
spoons or bowls

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.390 
spoons or bowls
apparently<00:02:42.290> it<00:02:42.349> has<00:02:42.500> some<00:02:42.709> kind<00:02:42.890> of<00:02:42.920> reaction

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
apparently it has some kind of reaction

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.490 
apparently it has some kind of reaction
with<00:02:43.519> the<00:02:43.579> color<00:02:43.790> and<00:02:44.090> which<00:02:44.989> is<00:02:45.170> why<00:02:45.319> I'm

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
with the color and which is why I'm

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.800 
with the color and which is why I'm
using<00:02:45.680> a<00:02:46.040> wooden<00:02:46.190> spoon<00:02:46.370> and<00:02:46.909> a<00:02:47.209> glass<00:02:47.420> bowl

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
using a wooden spoon and a glass bowl

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.750 
using a wooden spoon and a glass bowl
and<00:02:49.000> you<00:02:50.000> can<00:02:50.030> mix<00:02:50.659> this<00:02:51.379> stuff<00:02:51.440> with<00:02:52.129> anything

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
and you can mix this stuff with anything

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.319 
and you can mix this stuff with anything
any<00:02:53.569> kind<00:02:53.900> of<00:02:53.959> liquid<00:02:54.139> when<00:02:54.859> I<00:02:54.889> was<00:02:55.220> I<00:02:55.579> when<00:02:56.299> I

did the noir and Brune picture I use
coffee<00:03:00.440> and<00:03:00.819> today<00:03:01.819> I<00:03:02.180> am<00:03:02.750> using<00:03:03.019> just<00:03:03.500> a<00:03:03.650> cheap

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:03.859

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
bottle point so I went to Trader Joe's

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.740 
bottle point so I went to Trader Joe's
and<00:03:06.650> I<00:03:06.829> just<00:03:07.190> bought<00:03:07.519> like<00:03:08.329> a<00:03:08.450> three<00:03:08.599> dollar

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
bottle wine I'll probably use about half

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.190 
bottle wine I'll probably use about half
the<00:03:10.970> bottle<00:03:11.120> um<00:03:11.989> when<00:03:12.769> I'm<00:03:12.889> doing<00:03:13.370> this<00:03:13.599> also<00:03:14.599> I

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
uh you also need according to lush cling

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.650 
uh you also need according to lush cling

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
film they want you to clean wrap your

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.240 
film they want you to clean wrap your
head<00:03:26.810> when<00:03:27.109> this<00:03:27.260> is<00:03:27.410> over<00:03:27.730> I've<00:03:28.730> read<00:03:29.419> that<00:03:29.900> it

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
head when this is over I've read that it

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.849 
head when this is over I've read that it
can<00:03:31.250> change<00:03:31.549> the<00:03:32.269> color<00:03:32.510> if<00:03:32.870> you<00:03:33.260> cling<00:03:33.709> wrap

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
red if you cling wrap it and less right

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.920 
red if you cling wrap it and less right
if<00:03:39.379> you<00:03:39.530> don't<00:03:39.769> probably<00:03:40.359> some<00:03:41.359> kind<00:03:41.599> of<00:03:41.660> heat

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
if you don't probably some kind of heat

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.580 
if you don't probably some kind of heat
if<00:03:42.230> you<00:03:42.290> um<00:03:43.419> I've<00:03:44.419> always<00:03:44.720> clean<00:03:45.169> wrapped<00:03:45.379> it

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
if you um I've always clean wrapped it

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.710 
if you um I've always clean wrapped it
not<00:03:46.040> so<00:03:46.310> much<00:03:46.459> so<00:03:46.669> I<00:03:46.730> get<00:03:46.940> more<00:03:47.120> bread<00:03:47.359> but

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
not so much so I get more bread but

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.689 
not so much so I get more bread but
stitches<00:03:48.290> makes<00:03:48.470> it<00:03:48.590> easier<00:03:48.919> although<00:03:49.250> you

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:49.699 
stitches makes it easier although you
