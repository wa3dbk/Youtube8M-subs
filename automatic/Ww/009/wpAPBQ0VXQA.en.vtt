Brian's decided the basis pad off their

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.790 
Brian's decided the basis pad off their
iPhone<00:01:25.090> technology<00:01:25.660> what<00:01:26.290> that's<00:01:26.440> gonna<00:01:26.590> give

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
iPhone technology what that's gonna give

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.469 
iPhone technology what that's gonna give
the<00:01:26.920> goaltender<00:01:27.400> it's<00:01:27.670> a<00:01:27.790> nice<00:01:27.970> light<00:01:28.240> feel

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
the goaltender it's a nice light feel

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.210 
the goaltender it's a nice light feel
off<00:01:28.600> the<00:01:28.720> shelf<00:01:28.960> and<00:01:29.170> that<00:01:29.650> great<00:01:29.890> durability

off the shelf and that great durability

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.460 
off the shelf and that great durability
over<00:01:30.580> time<00:01:30.790> this<00:01:31.479> pad<00:01:31.690> isn't<00:01:31.869> gonna<00:01:32.020> mush<00:01:32.290> down

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
over time this pad isn't gonna mush down

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.520 
over time this pad isn't gonna mush down
into<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:32.800> ball<00:01:33.009> and<00:01:33.190> use<00:01:33.490> it<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:35.380> key

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
into the ball and use it the key

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.560 
into the ball and use it the key
difference<00:01:35.920> from<00:01:36.039> last<00:01:36.310> year<00:01:36.520> is<00:01:36.910> brands<00:01:37.360> full

difference from last year is brands full
flex<00:01:37.869> knee<00:01:38.080> system<00:01:38.470> basically<00:01:39.280> what<00:01:39.550> that<00:01:39.580> is

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
flex knee system basically what that is

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.230 
flex knee system basically what that is
his<00:01:41.470> knee<00:01:41.740> rolls<00:01:41.979> cut<00:01:42.250> out<00:01:42.369> inside<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:43.060> pad

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
his knee rolls cut out inside the pad

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.749 
his knee rolls cut out inside the pad
and<00:01:44.050> what<00:01:44.200> that<00:01:44.350> gives<00:01:44.530> a<00:01:44.680> pad<00:01:44.860> isn't<00:01:45.610> that

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
and what that gives a pad isn't that

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.590 
and what that gives a pad isn't that
nice<00:01:46.030> soft<00:01:46.570> feel<00:01:46.930> right<00:01:47.619> off<00:01:47.740> the<00:01:47.890> shelf<00:01:48.600> in

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
nice soft feel right off the shelf in

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.090 
nice soft feel right off the shelf in
addition<00:01:50.050> they've<00:01:50.229> also<00:01:50.380> softened<00:01:50.890> up<00:01:50.979> the

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
addition they've also softened up the

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.010 
addition they've also softened up the
boot<00:01:51.250> as<00:01:51.399> well<00:01:51.580> but<00:01:52.270> not<00:01:52.420> just<00:01:52.600> through<00:01:52.750> here

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
boot as well but not just through here

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.930 
boot as well but not just through here
laterally<00:01:53.890> as<00:01:54.009> well<00:01:54.190> just<00:01:54.490> like<00:01:54.610> a<00:01:54.640> pad<00:01:54.910> you

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
laterally as well just like a pad you

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.840 
laterally as well just like a pad you
would<00:01:55.210> have<00:01:55.300> seen<00:01:55.450> about<00:01:55.479> ten<00:01:55.840> years<00:01:55.990> ago

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
would have seen about ten years ago

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.040 
would have seen about ten years ago
although<00:01:57.850> they<00:01:57.970> reduced<00:01:58.300> the<00:01:58.479> taper<00:01:58.660> from<00:01:58.899> the

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
although they reduced the taper from the

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.529 
although they reduced the taper from the
sub-zero<00:01:59.259> with<00:02:00.220> that<00:02:00.369> soft<00:02:00.700> boot<00:02:01.000> it<00:02:01.330> really

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
sub-zero with that soft boot it really

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:02.880 
sub-zero with that soft boot it really
allows<00:02:01.720> the<00:02:01.899> goaltender<00:02:02.380> to<00:02:02.470> get<00:02:02.560> deep<00:02:02.770> in

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
allows the goaltender to get deep in

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.350 
allows the goaltender to get deep in
their<00:02:03.009> stance<00:02:03.250> get<00:02:03.580> those<00:02:03.700> aggressive<00:02:04.000> push

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
their stance get those aggressive push

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.199 
their stance get those aggressive push
offs<00:02:04.600> left<00:02:04.899> and<00:02:05.050> right<00:02:05.940> Brian's<00:02:06.940> has<00:02:07.030> also

00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:07.209 
offs left and right Brian's has also

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:09.050 
offs left and right Brian's has also
trimmed<00:02:07.630> down<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:07.990> outer<00:02:08.140> roll<00:02:08.440> a<00:02:08.470> little<00:02:08.679> bit

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
trimmed down the outer roll a little bit

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.220 
trimmed down the outer roll a little bit
basically<00:02:10.060> all<00:02:10.330> that's<00:02:10.479> gonna<00:02:10.660> do<00:02:10.899> is<00:02:10.929> not

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
basically all that's gonna do is not

basically all that's gonna do is not
going<00:02:11.349> to<00:02:11.410> add<00:02:11.470> too<00:02:11.590> much<00:02:11.680> function<00:02:12.130> but<00:02:12.370> it's

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
going to add too much function but it's

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.460 
going to add too much function but it's
gonna<00:02:12.580> bring<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:12.910> weight<00:02:13.090> down<00:02:13.120> to<00:02:13.599> clean<00:02:14.349> up

00:06:00.769 --> 00:06:00.779 
protection some guys didn't like the 0g

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:02.119 
protection some guys didn't like the 0g
and<00:06:00.989> the<00:06:01.259> protection<00:06:01.679> it<00:06:01.799> had<00:06:01.919> they're

00:06:02.119 --> 00:06:02.129 
and the protection it had they're

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:04.129 
and the protection it had they're
ultimately<00:06:02.549> cutting<00:06:03.059> it<00:06:03.149> off<00:06:03.329> for<00:06:03.809> customers

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:04.139 
ultimately cutting it off for customers

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:05.479 
ultimately cutting it off for customers
and<00:06:04.289> have<00:06:04.409> that<00:06:04.559> option<00:06:04.739> right<00:06:04.919> off<00:06:05.129> the<00:06:05.249> shelf

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:05.489 
and have that option right off the shelf

00:06:05.489 --> 00:06:07.999 
and have that option right off the shelf

for<00:06:10.559> that<00:06:10.679> extra<00:06:10.919> protection<00:06:11.039> I<00:06:11.579> find<00:06:12.059> it's<00:06:12.179> a

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:12.209 
for that extra protection I find it's a

00:06:12.209 --> 00:06:13.789 
for that extra protection I find it's a
little<00:06:12.419> bit<00:06:12.509> bulky<00:06:12.839> it<00:06:12.989> can<00:06:13.109> pop<00:06:13.349> right<00:06:13.379> out<00:06:13.679> as

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:13.799 
little bit bulky it can pop right out as

00:06:13.799 --> 00:06:15.979 
little bit bulky it can pop right out as
