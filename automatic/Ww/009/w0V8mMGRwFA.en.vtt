00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.110
 a character 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.540

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.150
 blah blah blah blah blah blah good 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:33.510

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:44.350
 as you can see we are in the 1.13 bone 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.180
 1.13 here 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.660
 to see place of appearance because the 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.660
 change and now 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:00.079
 good and we put here 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.329
 online hoping better I'm going to my 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:06.519
 garage because in the end I have nothing 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.519
 run over and not what we want 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.760
 we will be going again we will 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.640
 online and here it's already changing characters 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.350
 then we click on the x we put the x 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:29.119
 again 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:31.930
 good was a decision presenting the 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.930
 new car 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.940
 and here you see and I have my other character and 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:44.770
 I have 2 universe 63 the other level 11 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:50.020
 enough that believes the bronze 2 days ago 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:52.979
 and this is good how can you create me 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.229
 for example now I have to erase 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:02:01.329
 to create us because it does not let me 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:05.500
 more but to you if you want to create 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:06.969
 new or to compose erase to the square 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.750
 and achilles 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:14.200
 I do not want to because I do not want to put in 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:18.370
 this character of the girl but you 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:23.010
 will let create a new and good returns 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.010
 deleted because we are many 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.660
 well here we have both and how I have 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.080
 said like I'm not going to erase my thing 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:49.260
 but good if you see yours until here 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:52.980
 because squared erase is what you see 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:58.560
 is after moving to the right 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:00.630
 erase if it is save and then we will 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.900
 put a new character as you press 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.970
 there and then you create a new character 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.790
 how you want is can be girl can 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.700
 being a boy can be a boy of skin 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.020
 dark or well a dark-skinned girl 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.760
 good as you want more or less after 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.700
 you are going to improve the level will 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.060
 improving the ones that earn it good 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.060
 I'm going to do 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.870
