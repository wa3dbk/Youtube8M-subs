here's<00:00:01.410> a<00:00:01.500> quick<00:00:01.770> little<00:00:02.070> video<00:00:02.190> just<00:00:02.399> to<00:00:02.850> show

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
here's a quick little video just to show

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.390 
here's a quick little video just to show
you<00:00:03.179> how<00:00:03.540> to<00:00:03.570> install<00:00:04.080> a<00:00:04.319> manual<00:00:04.920> boost

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
you how to install a manual boost

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.299 
you how to install a manual boost
controller<00:00:05.970> on<00:00:06.210> your<00:00:06.420> turbo<00:00:06.870> just<00:00:07.500> like<00:00:07.680> this

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
controller on your turbo just like this

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.410 
controller on your turbo just like this
one<00:00:10.250> I'll<00:00:11.250> just<00:00:11.460> quickly<00:00:11.670> explain<00:00:11.910> what's

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
one I'll just quickly explain what's

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.689 
one I'll just quickly explain what's
going<00:00:12.719> on<00:00:13.099> is<00:00:14.960> the<00:00:15.960> original<00:00:16.410> survey<00:00:17.010> used<00:00:17.550> to

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
going on is the original survey used to

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.870 
going on is the original survey used to
have<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:17.910> nipple<00:00:18.210> that<00:00:18.840> came<00:00:19.109> out<00:00:19.320> here<00:00:19.880> and

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
have a nipple that came out here and

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.670 
have a nipple that came out here and
went<00:00:21.210> into<00:00:21.330> this<00:00:21.539> hose<00:00:21.810> some<00:00:22.109> went<00:00:22.260> straight

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
went into this hose some went straight

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.970 
went into this hose some went straight
down<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.160> wastegate<00:00:23.550> or<00:00:23.970> actuator<00:00:24.980> which

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
down to the wastegate or actuator which

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.529 
down to the wastegate or actuator which
lets<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.519> boost<00:00:26.849> air<00:00:27.859> come<00:00:28.859> through<00:00:29.330> push<00:00:30.330> on

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
lets the boost air come through push on

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.319 
lets the boost air come through push on
the<00:00:30.689> wastegate<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.500> push<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.489> rod<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.090> then

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
the wastegate and push a rod that then

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.160 
the wastegate and push a rod that then
opens<00:00:33.750> an<00:00:33.930> exhaust<00:00:34.320> port<00:00:34.620> up<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:35.219> let<00:00:35.399> the

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
opens an exhaust port up to let the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.270 
opens an exhaust port up to let the
turbo<00:00:37.170> stop<00:00:37.969> producing<00:00:38.969> boost<00:00:39.920> so<00:00:40.920> what<00:00:41.129> the

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
turbo stop producing boost so what the

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.660 
turbo stop producing boost so what the
boost<00:00:41.520> controller<00:00:41.969> does<00:00:42.270> is<00:00:43.399> lets<00:00:44.399> out<00:00:44.610> a

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
boost controller does is lets out a

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.520 
boost controller does is lets out a
small<00:00:44.969> amount<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.300> air<00:00:45.600> into<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.500> atmosphere

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
small amount of air into the atmosphere

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.740 
small amount of air into the atmosphere
so<00:00:47.070> there's<00:00:47.579> not<00:00:47.760> as<00:00:47.910> much<00:00:48.059> pressure<00:00:48.390> getting

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
so there's not as much pressure getting

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.709 
so there's not as much pressure getting
to<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.050> wastegate<00:00:49.520> so<00:00:50.520> we<00:00:50.670> can<00:00:50.910> control<00:00:51.239> the

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
to the wastegate so we can control the

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.130 
to the wastegate so we can control the
boost<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.550> know<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.789> modified<00:00:54.570> more<00:00:54.930> one

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
boost you know of modified more one

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.240 
boost you know of modified more one
slightly<00:00:55.980> over<00:00:57.739> drilled<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.890> tapped<00:00:58.949> a

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
slightly over drilled and tapped a

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.189 
slightly over drilled and tapped a
bigger<00:00:59.640> drooled<00:01:00.059> out<00:01:00.210> my<00:01:00.390> survey<00:01:00.780> on<00:01:00.930> tap<00:01:01.170> that

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
bigger drooled out my survey on tap that

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.450 
bigger drooled out my survey on tap that
and<00:01:01.620> change<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.969> check<00:01:03.719> valve<00:01:03.750> as<00:01:04.260> well<00:01:04.460> so

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
and change the check valve as well so

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.660 
and change the check valve as well so
check<00:01:05.489> valve<00:01:06.090> will<00:01:06.240> come<00:01:06.510> straight<00:01:06.750> out

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
check valve will come straight out

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.160 
check valve will come straight out
basically<00:01:08.670> bolt<00:01:09.090> straight<00:01:09.630> into<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:09.990> I'll

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
basically bolt straight into it I'll

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.240 
basically bolt straight into it I'll
screw<00:01:10.470> into<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:12.500> the<00:01:13.500> boost<00:01:13.770> controller

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
screw into it and the boost controller

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.539 
screw into it and the boost controller
will<00:01:14.549> mount<00:01:14.790> directly<00:01:15.450> onto<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:16.130> so<00:01:17.130> there's

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
will mount directly onto that so there's

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.640 
will mount directly onto that so there's
less<00:01:17.759> hose<00:01:18.030> clamps<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.110> like<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.290> go

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
less hose clamps and like that go

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.929 
less hose clamps and like that go
on<00:01:21.920> alright<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.189> can<00:01:23.310> probably<00:01:23.490> tell<00:01:23.790> the

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
on alright so you can probably tell the

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.260 
on alright so you can probably tell the
modifications<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:25.049> I've<00:01:25.200> made<00:01:26.060> I've<00:01:27.060> just

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
modifications that I've made I've just

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.319 
modifications that I've made I've just
made<00:01:27.509> this<00:01:27.720> into<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.110> solid<00:01:28.650> fitting<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.790> check

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
made this into a solid fitting the check

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.830 
made this into a solid fitting the check
valve<00:01:30.650> now<00:01:31.650> normally<00:01:32.310> you'd<00:01:33.180> want<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.600> arrow

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
valve now normally you'd want the arrow

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.560 
valve now normally you'd want the arrow
on<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.170> check<00:01:34.560> valve<00:01:34.590> going<00:01:35.520> towards<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.299> boost

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
on a check valve going towards the boost

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.880 
on a check valve going towards the boost
controller

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
controller

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.620 
controller
and<00:01:38.100> it's<00:01:38.250> pretty<00:01:38.520> important<00:01:39.150> oh<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.480> won't

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
and it's pretty important oh it won't

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.370 
and it's pretty important oh it won't
work<00:01:39.870> properly<00:01:40.670> now<00:01:41.720> the<00:01:42.720> boost<00:01:43.020> pressure

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
work properly now the boost pressure

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.850 
work properly now the boost pressure
comes<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:44.720> into<00:01:45.720> your<00:01:45.750> boost<00:01:46.110> controller<00:01:46.530> here

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
comes in into your boost controller here

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.070 
comes in into your boost controller here
and<00:01:47.160> gets<00:01:47.460> vented<00:01:47.880> out<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:50.180> then<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.840> comes

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
and gets vented out and then it comes

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.680 
and gets vented out and then it comes
out<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.440> here<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.190> you<00:01:53.790> can<00:01:53.970> either<00:01:54.090> pond<00:01:54.480> that

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
out of here and you can either pond that

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.250 
out of here and you can either pond that
back<00:01:55.230> into<00:01:55.830> your<00:01:56.190> air<00:01:56.460> box<00:01:56.870> leading<00:01:57.870> just<00:01:58.080> let

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
back into your air box leading just let

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.870 
back into your air box leading just let
it<00:01:58.350> go<00:01:58.500> out<00:01:58.530> into<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.010> atmosphere<00:01:59.160> it<00:01:59.580> doesn't

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
it go out into the atmosphere it doesn't

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.190 
it go out into the atmosphere it doesn't
really<00:02:00.030> matter<00:02:01.880> alright<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.240> here's<00:02:03.690> mine

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
really matter alright so here's mine

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.550 
really matter alright so here's mine
install<00:02:05.240> now<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.390> difference<00:02:06.900> between<00:02:07.080> mine

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
install now the difference between mine

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
install now the difference between mine
and<00:02:07.800> yours<00:02:08.570> is<00:02:09.570> you'll<00:02:09.990> have<00:02:10.260> hose<00:02:10.649> running

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
and yours is you'll have hose running

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.580 
and yours is you'll have hose running
from<00:02:11.880> your<00:02:12.060> turbo<00:02:12.620> to<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.770> check<00:02:14.010> belt<00:02:14.480> then

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
from your turbo to the check belt then

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.530 
from your turbo to the check belt then
from<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.709> check<00:02:16.980> valve<00:02:17.180> to<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.209> boost

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
from the check valve to the boost

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.720 
from the check valve to the boost
controller<00:02:19.110> that's<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:19.980> only<00:02:20.280> difference

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
controller that's the only difference

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.449 
controller that's the only difference
there<00:02:20.940> in<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.510> Aero<00:02:21.890> would<00:02:22.890> be<00:02:23.040> pointing

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
there in the Aero would be pointing

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.260 
there in the Aero would be pointing
towards<00:02:24.090> a<00:02:24.150> boost<00:02:24.390> controller<00:02:25.310> then<00:02:26.310> at<00:02:27.030> the

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
towards a boost controller then at the

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.070 
towards a boost controller then at the

silicon is when it gets hot it gets

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.340 
silicon is when it gets hot it gets
really<00:02:40.709> brittle<00:02:41.269> if<00:02:42.269> you<00:02:42.420> get<00:02:42.600> some<00:02:42.810> back<00:02:43.110> in

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
really brittle if you get some back in

really brittle if you get some back in
one<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:44.660> probably<00:02:45.660> these<00:02:45.959> type<00:02:46.350> of<00:02:47.150> hose

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
one and probably these type of hose

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.780 
one and probably these type of hose
clamps<00:02:48.750> will<00:02:48.870> be<00:02:49.019> better<00:02:49.260> than<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:50.400> screw

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
clamps will be better than the screw

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.060 
clamps will be better than the screw
types<00:02:51.090> is<00:02:51.420> it<00:02:51.600> pretty<00:02:51.840> bulky<00:02:52.790> that's<00:02:53.790> about<00:02:54.150> it

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
types is it pretty bulky that's about it

I'm<00:02:56.070> just<00:02:56.489> one<00:02:56.700> node<00:02:56.970> with<00:02:57.620> my<00:02:58.620> car<00:02:59.360> it's<00:03:00.360> got<00:03:00.720> a

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
I'm just one node with my car it's got a

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.390 
I'm just one node with my car it's got a
fuel<00:03:02.430> cut<00:03:02.700> out<00:03:02.880> when<00:03:03.450> you<00:03:03.959> get<00:03:04.200> over<00:03:04.620> seven

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400

pounds<00:03:05.880> of<00:03:06.030> boost<00:03:06.269> or<00:03:06.540> something<00:03:06.570> like<00:03:06.959> that

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
pounds of boost or something like that

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:16.540 
pounds of boost or something like that
so<00:03:09.260> basically<00:03:10.260> you<00:03:10.800> need<00:03:10.920> to<00:03:10.980> UM<00:03:12.260> get<00:03:13.340> an<00:03:14.989> ECU

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
so basically you need to UM get an ECU

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.490 
so basically you need to UM get an ECU
