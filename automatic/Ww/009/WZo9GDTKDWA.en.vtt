00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.030 
what we've got here is a a mic adapter

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.930 
what we've got here is a a mic adapter
that<00:00:10.960> allows<00:00:11.020> you<00:00:11.500> to<00:00:11.620> connect<00:00:11.950> a<00:00:12.160> computer

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:12.940 
that allows you to connect a computer

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.160 
that allows you to connect a computer
headset<00:00:13.560> into<00:00:14.560> your<00:00:15.280> radio<00:00:15.810> so<00:00:16.810> the<00:00:16.930> way<00:00:17.050> it

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.170 
headset into your radio so the way it

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.980 
headset into your radio so the way it
works<00:00:17.350> is<00:00:17.620> a<00:00:17.820> standard<00:00:18.820> 8<00:00:18.970> pin<00:00:19.289> connector<00:00:21.990> mic

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:22.990 
works is a standard 8 pin connector mic

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.660 
works is a standard 8 pin connector mic
input<00:00:24.690> push-to-talk<00:00:25.690> input<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:27.310> a<00:00:27.400> battery

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:27.670 
input push-to-talk input and a battery

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.310 
input push-to-talk input and a battery
box<00:00:28.000> I'll<00:00:28.300> explain<00:00:28.539> what<00:00:28.720> that<00:00:28.869> is<00:00:28.990> for<00:00:29.170> in<00:00:29.260> a

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
box I'll explain what that is for in a

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.050 
box I'll explain what that is for in a
minute<00:00:29.560> and<00:00:29.680> this<00:00:29.980> basically<00:00:30.430> allows<00:00:30.550> me<00:00:30.940> to

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
minute and this basically allows me to

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:38.779 
minute and this basically allows me to
use<00:00:32.249> my<00:00:34.140> Plantronics<00:00:35.140> PC<00:00:36.069> gaming<00:00:36.909> headset

00:00:38.779 --> 00:00:38.789 
use my Plantronics PC gaming headset

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:41.160 
use my Plantronics PC gaming headset
while<00:00:39.789> I<00:00:39.850> talk<00:00:40.149> on<00:00:40.179> the<00:00:40.359> radio<00:00:40.659> so<00:00:40.899> I've<00:00:40.989> got

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
while I talk on the radio so I've got

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.709 
while I talk on the radio so I've got
hands-free<00:00:41.620> my<00:00:42.010> hands-free<00:00:42.309> for<00:00:42.729> logging<00:00:43.329> and

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:43.719 
hands-free my hands-free for logging and
