00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.640
 video where are we going to give minecraft and 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.190
 good 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.460
 first of all let's see the requirements 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.870
 and what's the good of a contest? 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.110
 it simply consists for those who do not 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.630
 know is that I'm going to give him the game 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.600
 minecraft that good you'll know almost everything 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.090
 what is and should give away totally free 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.150
 and if I say the only thing I'm going to ask is going to 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.740
 do these things here 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.040
 we have to be subscribed to my channel 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.590
 because I'm not going to give it away in the game to 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.000
 one that comes to the face without 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.760
 even go to seen a video of me and 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.700
 say tomÃ¡s is not subscribed in the channel 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.300
 give like and favorites about all like 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.690
 to the video since only I do not win not 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.649
 has this video better and at least 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.140
 like winning favorite is a thing that 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.030
 I ask then to participate you have to 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.710
 leave a comment saying participated and 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.510
 he agreed to the contest 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.920
 and if you want to put something else I can put 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:10.450
 just below what you think you want 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.510
 to say about this I agree on the 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.330
 contest must be the contest was going to be 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.159
 a draw say I'm going to put in a 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:22.119
 page that is called a random dot org 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:24.790
 or something like that and I'm going to put 610 for example 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.830
 participants or 50 million what I know is 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.180
 there I'll put it and come a 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.840
 number and that number will be the winner 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:34.030
 it's just to say that they do not see me later 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.590
 the people with saying is that they 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.780
 I wanted to win is that I do not know what 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.160
 cheated they do not know what I'm going to 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.509
 do that in it and keep it to 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.850
 one that I'm not going to look at the other 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.350
 person say I'm going to give the button and already 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.890
 is because the last of that the contest 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.570
 step that was choosing a culture and that 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.700
 once I was with DJing with that 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.800
 I do not know what that mine was better 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.340
 it is already next to this form and the 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.340
 to touch 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.070

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.320
 comment do not put more than one comment 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.640
 since I already have to go looking at this 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.810
 he put the comment and once he has 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:12.110
 put again is worth once 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.910
 As you can see here the prize will be given to the 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.660
 two thousand subscribers ie the copy 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:20.150
 I will give the two thousand subscribers and can 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.360
 that before saying it will be at 1900 for and 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.730
 more or less but we will get to you or 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:30.050
 400 subscribers that I know I do not know 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.940
 what if you help me too 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.380
 advertising the channel saying look 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.170
 this gives one of these micro I do not know 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:40.140
 what then helps me to bring people 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:42.720
 much better and nothing 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:47.130
 I hope you are lucky that this 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:51.050
 that although it is and good another thing that 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.050
 I wanted to say is that 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.810
 there was one more thing to that when I get 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.520
 partners and that I get it at the moment 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:08.410
 50% of video that wins even a little bit 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:10.570
 I will dedicate it to draw games and 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.319
 it will be better not always minecraft 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.510
 but games like that 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:19.950
 another thing I also wanted to say is that 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:22.200
 when I released a game because youtube 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.999
 can youtube a lot do not like that 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.849
 especially to the bread company that 

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:29.159
 give away things in the future when you have 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.409
 partner will do the contests on twitter 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:32.700
 so follow me on twitter since now 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:34.379
 same if what you do for the channel up 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.650
 that has no partner but in the future 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:39.959
 I'll do it for twitter it's worth and nothing js 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.459
 luck you already know in the comment and 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.499
 when I say I 'm an oncologist in the 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.030
 competition is that I will not complain pass 

00:03:43.499 --> 00:03:48.599
 what happens since it is a contest 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.849
 free and it's already good that's all for 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:55.069
