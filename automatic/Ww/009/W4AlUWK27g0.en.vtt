this<00:00:06.359> is<00:00:06.569> I<00:00:06.600> don't<00:00:07.259> know<00:00:07.379> if<00:00:07.589> I<00:00:07.680> mentioned<00:00:07.890> it

this is I don't know if I mentioned it

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.230 
this is I don't know if I mentioned it
or<00:00:08.280> not<00:00:08.370> I<00:00:08.400> think<00:00:08.670> I've<00:00:08.760> seen<00:00:08.910> it<00:00:09.000> a<00:00:09.059> couple

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
or not I think I've seen it a couple

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.740 
or not I think I've seen it a couple
other<00:00:09.420> places<00:00:09.630> but<00:00:09.960> oh<00:00:10.290> just<00:00:11.630> freerunning<00:00:12.630> and

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
other places but oh just freerunning and

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.250 
other places but oh just freerunning and
I<00:00:13.019> came<00:00:13.799> over<00:00:13.980> this<00:00:14.219> I<00:00:14.519> almost<00:00:15.420> ate<00:00:15.809> it<00:00:15.839> but<00:00:16.109> I

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
I came over this I almost ate it but I

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.070 
I came over this I almost ate it but I
bailed<00:00:16.890> out<00:00:17.160> using<00:00:18.150> this<00:00:18.449> trick<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:18.900> made

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
bailed out using this trick I made

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.830 
bailed out using this trick I made
pretty<00:00:19.830> much<00:00:20.039> what<00:00:20.189> it<00:00:20.279> is<00:00:20.369> it's<00:00:20.699> any<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.779> think

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
pretty much what it is it's any I think

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.320 
pretty much what it is it's any I think
I've<00:00:22.109> seen<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.380> before<00:00:22.470> but<00:00:23.460> usually<00:00:23.820> it's

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
I've seen it before but usually it's

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.000 
I've seen it before but usually it's
used<00:00:24.660> on<00:00:24.840> any<00:00:24.990> type<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.260> high<00:00:25.470> fence<00:00:25.740> that<00:00:25.920> you

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
used on any type of high fence that you

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.220 
used on any type of high fence that you
can't<00:00:26.250> bulk<00:00:26.490> over<00:00:26.820> what<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:28.019> come

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
can't bulk over what it is is you come

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.529 
can't bulk over what it is is you come
over<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.680> using<00:00:28.890> your<00:00:29.070> stomach<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:30.240> way<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.390> do

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
over it using your stomach the way I do

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.479 
over it using your stomach the way I do
it<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:31.019> like<00:00:31.140> one<00:00:31.439> hand<00:00:31.650> out<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.099> one<00:00:32.219> hand

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
it is I like one hand out and one hand

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.190 
it is I like one hand out and one hand
up<00:00:32.610> here<00:00:32.759> for<00:00:32.969> support<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.480> then<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.050> pretty

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
up here for support and then you pretty

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.620 
up here for support and then you pretty
much<00:00:34.290> just<00:00:34.410> flip<00:00:34.739> off<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.219> so<00:00:35.630> I'll

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
much just flip off of it so I'll

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.000 
much just flip off of it so I'll
demonstrate<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:37.140> really<00:00:37.350> quick<00:00:37.530> show<00:00:37.950> you

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
demonstrate it really quick show you

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:49.130 
demonstrate it really quick show you
guys<00:00:38.160> what's<00:00:47.390> the<00:00:48.390> difficulty<00:00:48.930> with<00:00:49.079> this

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
guys what's the difficulty with this

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.529 
guys what's the difficulty with this
trick<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.950> actual<00:00:50.370> landing<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:51.420> wanna

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
trick is the actual landing you wanna

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.060 
trick is the actual landing you wanna
make<00:00:51.690> sure<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.870> don't<00:00:52.020> over<00:00:52.379> rotate<00:00:52.860> and

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
make sure you don't over rotate and

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.420 
make sure you don't over rotate and
faceplant<00:00:53.489> if<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.480> happen<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.960> over<00:00:55.140> rotate

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
faceplant if you happen to over rotate

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.920 
faceplant if you happen to over rotate
you<00:00:56.430> just<00:00:56.610> want<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.820> roll<00:00:56.969> out<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.780> guys

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
you just want to roll out of it you guys

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.750 
you just want to roll out of it you guys
don't<00:00:58.260> roll<00:00:58.770> yet<00:00:58.980> we'll<00:00:59.250> do<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.609> video<00:00:59.879> next

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
don't roll yet we'll do that video next

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.280 
don't roll yet we'll do that video next
if<00:01:01.880> you<00:01:02.000> haven't<00:01:02.240> seen<00:01:02.360> it<00:01:02.450> go<00:01:02.930> check<00:01:02.960> it<00:01:03.230> out

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
if you haven't seen it go check it out

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.689 
if you haven't seen it go check it out
it'll<00:01:03.560> probably<00:01:03.770> be<00:01:03.950> up<00:01:04.040> by<00:01:04.160> the<00:01:04.250> time<00:01:04.430> this<00:01:04.580> is

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
it'll probably be up by the time this is

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.740 
it'll probably be up by the time this is
up<00:01:05.020> so<00:01:06.020> basically<00:01:06.530> this<00:01:07.400> is<00:01:07.460> your<00:01:07.730> support<00:01:08.060> and

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
up so basically this is your support and

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:09.960 
up so basically this is your support and
it's<00:01:08.930> just<00:01:09.080> pretty<00:01:09.230> much<00:01:09.320> like<00:01:09.530> a<00:01:09.590> front<00:01:09.800> flip

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
it's just pretty much like a front flip

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.670 
it's just pretty much like a front flip
you<00:01:10.970> can't<00:01:11.180> do<00:01:11.300> that<00:01:11.420> yet<00:01:11.600> this<00:01:11.840> is<00:01:12.020> really<00:01:12.440> a

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
you can't do that yet this is really a

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.320 
you can't do that yet this is really a
lot<00:01:13.100> easier<00:01:13.430> than<00:01:13.550> doing<00:01:13.610> a<00:01:13.790> front<00:01:13.970> flip<00:01:14.060> try

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
lot easier than doing a front flip try

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.480 
lot easier than doing a front flip try
this<00:01:14.390> first<00:01:14.720> because<00:01:15.110> of<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:15.920> support<00:01:16.250> but

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
this first because of the support but

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.540 
this first because of the support but
just<00:01:17.000> one<00:01:17.210> hand<00:01:17.420> one<00:01:17.840> hand<00:01:18.080> he's<00:01:18.890> gotta<00:01:19.400> be

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
just one hand one hand he's gotta be

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.860 
just one hand one hand he's gotta be
brave<00:01:19.760> you<00:01:20.000> gotta<00:01:20.120> throw<00:01:20.270> your<00:01:20.479> body<00:01:20.660> over

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
brave you gotta throw your body over

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.930 
brave you gotta throw your body over
that's<00:01:21.290> pretty<00:01:21.560> much<00:01:21.620> all<00:01:21.770> I<00:01:21.830> can<00:01:22.010> say<00:01:22.190> use

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
that's pretty much all I can say use

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.730 
that's pretty much all I can say use
