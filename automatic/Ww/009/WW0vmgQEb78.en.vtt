original kinetic sculpture and a
proposal<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.229> install<00:01:13.409> it

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
proposal to install it

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.280 
proposal to install it
I<00:01:14.070> think<00:01:14.909> it's<00:01:15.000> fine-tuning<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.659> product<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.259> a

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
I think it's fine-tuning a product to a

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.710 
I think it's fine-tuning a product to a
certain<00:01:16.619> extent<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.640> project<00:01:18.090> began<00:01:18.420> with<00:01:18.659> a

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
certain extent the project began with a

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.810 
certain extent the project began with a
teacher<00:01:19.049> planning<00:01:19.500> session<00:01:20.100> over<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.549> summer

teacher planning session over the summer

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.940 
teacher planning session over the summer
it's<00:01:21.450> very<00:01:21.900> difficult<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.409> have<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.590> really

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
it's very difficult to have a really

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.920 
it's very difficult to have a really
deep<00:01:23.130> meaningful<00:01:23.580> conversation<00:01:24.210> around

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
deep meaningful conversation around

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.210 
deep meaningful conversation around
curriculum<00:01:25.229> how<00:01:25.650> that's<00:01:25.830> all<00:01:25.890> going<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.100> fit

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
curriculum how that's all going to fit

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.580 
curriculum how that's all going to fit
together<00:01:26.340> if<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:27.180> don't<00:01:27.210> actually<00:01:27.659> have<00:01:28.229> the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
together if you don't actually have the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.319 
together if you don't actually have the
thing<00:01:28.799> made<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.460> can't<00:01:29.640> connect<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.030> kind<00:01:30.270> of

Goodwin<00:01:35.340> took<00:01:35.640> up<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.939> challenge<00:01:36.240> of

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
Goodwin took up the challenge of

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.260 
Goodwin took up the challenge of
building<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:37.229> model<00:01:37.590> prototype<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:38.850> decided

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
building a model prototype so I decided

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.179 
building a model prototype so I decided
I'd<00:01:39.450> take<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.750> sculpture<00:01:40.259> course<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.890> so

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
I'd take a sculpture course and and so

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.060 
I'd take a sculpture course and and so
this<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.579> what<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.119> made<00:01:42.659> in<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:42.869> course<00:01:43.320> and

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
this is what I made in that course and

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.910 
this is what I made in that course and
so<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:44.759> brought<00:01:45.149> this<00:01:45.360> in<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.439> kids<00:01:46.649> right

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
so I brought this in and the kids right

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.399 
so I brought this in and the kids right
away<00:01:47.000> pointed<00:01:48.000> out<00:01:48.149> well<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:49.020> doesn't<00:01:49.259> work

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
school but the big difference is a

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.250

you<00:03:50.230> follow<00:03:50.530> the<00:03:50.860> directions<00:03:50.890> it'll<00:03:51.610> come<00:03:51.760> out

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
you follow the directions it'll come out

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.270 
you follow the directions it'll come out
just<00:03:52.090> like<00:03:52.209> mine<00:03:52.510> and<00:03:52.780> that's<00:03:52.900> great<00:03:53.500> that<00:03:54.160> was

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
just like mine and that's great that was

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.190 
just like mine and that's great that was
good<00:03:54.459> for<00:03:54.640> those<00:03:54.790> times<00:03:55.150> but<00:03:55.810> times<00:03:56.079> have

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
good for those times but times have

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.860 
good for those times but times have
changed<00:03:56.400> so<00:03:57.400> the<00:03:57.549> focus<00:03:57.790> is<00:03:58.060> more<00:03:58.120> on<00:03:58.360> the<00:03:58.450> kids

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.960 
changed so the focus is more on the kids
inventing<00:03:59.590> their<00:03:59.769> own<00:03:59.920> stuff<00:04:00.310> and<00:04:00.670> if<00:04:00.850> the

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
inventing their own stuff and if the

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.340 
inventing their own stuff and if the
wind<00:04:01.150> is<00:04:01.209> blowing<00:04:01.269> hard<00:04:01.540> enough<00:04:01.900> then<00:04:02.140> it'll

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
wind is blowing hard enough then it'll

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.620 
wind is blowing hard enough then it'll
make<00:04:02.530> this<00:04:02.680> spin<00:04:03.489> around<00:04:03.610> and<00:04:04.090> the<00:04:04.480> weight

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
make this spin around and the weight

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.530 
make this spin around and the weight
from<00:04:04.780> this<00:04:04.959> guy<00:04:05.110> makes<00:04:05.410> them<00:04:05.560> come<00:04:05.739> back<00:04:05.769> down

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
from this guy makes them come back down

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.180 
from this guy makes them come back down
this<00:04:07.540> class<00:04:07.840> is<00:04:08.019> like<00:04:08.110> fun<00:04:08.440> because<00:04:08.769> like<00:04:09.010> they

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
this class is like fun because like they

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.819 
this class is like fun because like they
teach<00:04:09.370> us<00:04:09.579> how<00:04:09.880> to<00:04:10.209> be<00:04:10.450> creative<00:04:11.049> and<00:04:11.230> to<00:04:11.680> make

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
teach us how to be creative and to make

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.069 
teach us how to be creative and to make
our<00:04:11.980> own<00:04:12.160> designs<00:04:12.549> so<00:04:13.209> like<00:04:13.360> we<00:04:13.510> have<00:04:13.780> that

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
our own designs so like we have that

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:15.240 
our own designs so like we have that
experience<00:04:14.709> as

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
experience as

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.020 
experience as
I<00:04:15.700> think<00:04:16.660> kids<00:04:16.959> have<00:04:17.290> the<00:04:18.130> opportunity<00:04:18.160> to

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
I think kids have the opportunity to

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.150 
I think kids have the opportunity to
kind<00:04:19.239> of<00:04:19.390> tinker<00:04:19.810> they<00:04:20.320> get<00:04:20.500> to<00:04:20.620> think<00:04:20.860> about

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
kind of tinker they get to think about

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.820 
kind of tinker they get to think about
something<00:04:21.519> but<00:04:21.910> then<00:04:22.090> also<00:04:22.660> actually<00:04:23.470> build

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
something but then also actually build

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.480 
something but then also actually build
it<00:04:24.040> create<00:04:24.580> it<00:04:24.610> and<00:04:24.910> in<00:04:25.510> that<00:04:25.540> process<00:04:26.350> fix<00:04:27.280> it

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
it create it and in that process fix it

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.540 
it create it and in that process fix it
when<00:04:27.670> things<00:04:27.850> go<00:04:28.120> wrong<00:04:28.860> it's<00:04:29.860> an<00:04:30.040> incredible

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
when things go wrong it's an incredible

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.240 
when things go wrong it's an incredible
value<00:04:30.610> that<00:04:31.390> I<00:04:31.570> think<00:04:31.990> is<00:04:32.110> lacking<00:04:32.410> where<00:04:32.980> they

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
value that I think is lacking where they

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.190 
value that I think is lacking where they
don't<00:04:33.370> have<00:04:33.490> a<00:04:33.670> class<00:04:34.030> like<00:04:34.360> this<00:04:34.630> or<00:04:34.900> like<00:04:34.930> an

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
don't have a class like this or like an

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.200 
don't have a class like this or like an
art<00:04:35.440> class<00:04:35.710> or<00:04:36.010> music<00:04:36.460> or<00:04:36.610> something<00:04:37.000> with<00:04:37.150> the

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
art class or music or something with the

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.820 
art class or music or something with the
CAD<00:04:37.390> X<00:04:37.630> have<00:04:37.810> to<00:04:37.870> do<00:04:38.140> something<00:04:38.560> get<00:04:38.680> their

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
CAD X have to do something get their

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.850 
CAD X have to do something get their
hands<00:04:39.070> dirty<00:04:39.250> and<00:04:39.640> and<00:04:39.820> make<00:04:40.300> stuff<00:04:40.620> excellent

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
hands dirty and and make stuff excellent

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.270 
hands dirty and and make stuff excellent
last<00:04:42.700> night<00:04:43.000> when<00:04:43.630> I<00:04:43.810> put<00:04:44.200> all<00:04:44.410> the<00:04:44.890> sculptures

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
last night when I put all the sculptures

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.310 
last night when I put all the sculptures
so<00:04:45.820> there's<00:04:46.030> like<00:04:46.150> 80<00:04:46.450> sculptures<00:04:47.170> in<00:04:47.290> the

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
front of my room and it was really

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.810 
front of my room and it was really
amazing<00:04:49.720> thinking<00:04:50.470> of<00:04:50.740> where<00:04:50.980> we<00:04:51.100> started<00:04:51.400> and

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
amazing thinking of where we started and

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.760 
amazing thinking of where we started and
where<00:04:51.880> we<00:04:52.120> ended<00:04:52.450> up<00:04:52.540> just<00:04:52.930> a<00:04:53.080> variety<00:04:53.290> of

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
where we ended up just a variety of

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.460 
where we ended up just a variety of
ideas<00:04:54.070> and<00:04:54.790> the<00:04:54.880> ingenuity<00:04:55.480> you<00:04:55.780> had<00:04:56.020> well<00:04:56.410> you

ideas and the ingenuity you had well you

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.560 
ideas and the ingenuity you had well you
should<00:04:56.650> be<00:04:56.740> really<00:04:56.950> proud<00:04:56.980> it's<00:04:57.790> just<00:04:58.030> so<00:04:58.300> cool

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570

it's really very cool kinetic because it

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.429 
it's really very cool kinetic because it
was<00:05:06.370> on<00:05:06.490> its<00:05:06.610> own<00:05:06.760> so<00:05:07.240> it<00:05:07.419> blows<00:05:07.600> in<00:05:07.780> the<00:05:07.810> wind

mean you did the math to figure out the

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:26.279 
mean you did the math to figure out the
balance<00:05:23.429> well<00:05:24.429> this<00:05:24.819> one<00:05:25.119> which<00:05:25.479> is<00:05:25.719> two

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:26.289 
balance well this one which is two

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:27.730 
balance well this one which is two
inches<00:05:26.469> by<00:05:26.709> two<00:05:26.739> inches

inches by two inches

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.490 
inches by two inches
yeah<00:05:27.889> so<00:05:28.460> I<00:05:28.759> didn't<00:05:29.030> top<00:05:29.330> of<00:05:29.539> that<00:05:29.660> it's<00:05:30.440> pretty

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
yeah so I didn't top of that it's pretty

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.379 
yeah so I didn't top of that it's pretty
exciting<00:05:30.919> to<00:05:31.099> see<00:05:31.280> the<00:05:31.370> kids<00:05:31.639> get<00:05:31.789> engaged<00:05:32.180> in

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:32.389 
exciting to see the kids get engaged in

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:33.820 
exciting to see the kids get engaged in
the<00:05:32.479> work<00:05:32.660> that<00:05:32.690> they're<00:05:32.990> doing<00:05:33.020> to<00:05:33.680> take

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
the work that they're doing to take

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.350 
the work that they're doing to take
ownership<00:05:34.160> of<00:05:34.400> the<00:05:34.520> work<00:05:34.669> they're<00:05:34.880> doing<00:05:34.910> feel

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
ownership of the work they're doing feel

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.809 
ownership of the work they're doing feel
responsible<00:05:36.050> for<00:05:36.110> it<00:05:36.380> and<00:05:37.310> then<00:05:37.430> be<00:05:37.580> able<00:05:37.610> to

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:37.819 
responsible for it and then be able to

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:38.950 
responsible for it and then be able to
talk<00:05:38.030> about<00:05:38.240> the<00:05:38.479> things<00:05:38.690> that<00:05:38.810> they're

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
talk about the things that they're

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.390 
talk about the things that they're
learning<00:05:39.110> so<00:05:39.500> that<00:05:39.650> you<00:05:39.770> had<00:05:39.889> this<00:05:40.099> side

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
learning so that you had this side

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.120 
learning so that you had this side
balancing<00:05:40.940> this<00:05:41.090> side<00:05:41.500> sometimes<00:05:42.500> I<00:05:42.830> think<00:05:42.889> we

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
balancing this side sometimes I think we

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.029 
balancing this side sometimes I think we
get<00:05:43.280> too<00:05:43.580> concerned<00:05:44.270> about<00:05:45.169> the<00:05:45.440> standards

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:46.039 
get too concerned about the standards

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:47.830 
get too concerned about the standards
and<00:05:46.220> there's<00:05:46.430> an<00:05:46.580> assumption<00:05:46.970> behind<00:05:47.509> a<00:05:47.630> lot

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
and there's an assumption behind a lot

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.330 
and there's an assumption behind a lot
of<00:05:47.870> that<00:05:47.990> do<00:05:48.259> we<00:05:48.289> actually<00:05:48.530> know<00:05:48.889> what<00:05:49.220> our

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
of that do we actually know what our

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.460 
of that do we actually know what our
kids<00:05:49.550> are<00:05:49.669> gonna<00:05:49.759> face<00:05:50.030> in<00:05:50.210> the<00:05:50.270> future<00:05:50.599> and

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:51.470 
kids are gonna face in the future and
