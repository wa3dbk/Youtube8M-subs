I think it hurt this friendship I don't
think<00:03:55.170> too<00:03:55.290> far<00:03:55.470> ahead<00:03:55.530> I<00:03:55.890> think<00:03:56.220> once<00:03:56.550> you

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
think too far ahead I think once you

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.620 
think too far ahead I think once you
jump<00:03:56.910> in<00:03:57.120> it's<00:03:57.300> hard<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:57.600> kind<00:03:57.720> of<00:03:57.840> go<00:03:57.960> back<00:03:57.990> I

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
jump in it's hard to kind of go back I

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.790 
jump in it's hard to kind of go back I
don't<00:04:00.630> know<00:04:00.720> I<00:04:00.750> mean<00:04:00.960> I<00:04:01.080> think<00:04:01.290> that's<00:04:01.560> such<00:04:01.770> a

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
don't know I mean I think that's such a

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.050 
don't know I mean I think that's such a
socially<00:04:02.520> constructed<00:04:03.360> notion<00:04:04.050> I<00:04:04.260> think

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
socially constructed notion I think

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.120 
socially constructed notion I think
biologically<00:04:06.060> if<00:04:06.660> you<00:04:06.900> kind<00:04:07.170> of<00:04:07.260> ignore<00:04:07.440> what

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
biologically if you kind of ignore what

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.400 
biologically if you kind of ignore what
movies<00:04:08.520> tell<00:04:08.970> you<00:04:09.209> or<00:04:09.510> the<00:04:09.780> way<00:04:09.900> things<00:04:10.230> are

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
movies tell you or the way things are

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.040 
movies tell you or the way things are
supposed<00:04:10.590> to<00:04:10.980> be<00:04:11.220> you<00:04:11.910> can<00:04:12.120> just<00:04:12.150> have<00:04:12.690> a

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050

really<00:04:13.320> good<00:04:13.440> relationship<00:04:14.100> with<00:04:14.700> someone

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
really good relationship with someone

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.370 
really good relationship with someone
that<00:04:15.630> is<00:04:16.380> based<00:04:16.890> around<00:04:17.400> a<00:04:18.060> consensual<00:04:18.600> desire

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
that is based around a consensual desire

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:25.840 
that is based around a consensual desire
for<00:04:19.890> friendship<00:04:20.430> as<00:04:20.700> opposed<00:04:21.060> to<00:04:21.180> sex
