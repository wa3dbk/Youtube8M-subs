players<00:01:15.750> for<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.049> sake<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:16.470> video

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
players for the sake of this video

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.980 
players for the sake of this video
because<00:01:17.670> sometimes<00:01:18.210> four<00:01:18.479> players<00:01:18.750> actually

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
because sometimes four players actually

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.289 
because sometimes four players actually
does<00:01:19.590> take<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.920> pretty<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.250> pretty<00:01:20.759> long<00:01:21.240> time

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
does take a pretty a pretty long time

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.149 
does take a pretty a pretty long time
together<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:22.200> well<00:01:22.320> anyway<00:01:22.619> we'll<00:01:22.770> do<00:01:22.890> play

together so well anyway we'll do play
now<00:01:23.570> sometimes<00:01:24.570> this<00:01:24.659> takes<00:01:24.750> really<00:01:25.110> quick<00:01:25.409> or

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
now sometimes this takes really quick or

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.969 
now sometimes this takes really quick or
really<00:01:26.100> long<00:01:26.369> time<00:01:26.610> but<00:01:27.119> just<00:01:27.450> depends<00:01:30.979> ok

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
really long time but just depends ok

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.410 
really long time but just depends ok
