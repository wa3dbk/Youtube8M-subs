my<00:03:06.310> legs<00:03:06.550> I<00:03:06.880> held<00:03:07.240> him<00:03:07.390> a<00:03:07.480> long<00:03:07.660> time<00:03:07.690> wondering

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
my legs I held him a long time wondering

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.080

why<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:08.560> aircraft<00:03:08.800> had<00:03:09.220> not<00:03:09.370> come<00:03:09.610> down<00:03:09.820> when

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
why the aircraft had not come down when

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.930 
why the aircraft had not come down when
the<00:03:10.120> pilot<00:03:10.510> saw<00:03:10.690> the<00:03:10.750> smoke<00:03:11.520> at<00:03:12.520> last<00:03:12.760> I

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
the pilot saw the smoke at last I

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.280 
the pilot saw the smoke at last I
thought<00:03:13.150> perhaps<00:03:13.390> they<00:03:13.750> didn't<00:03:14.050> see<00:03:14.170> the

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
thought perhaps they didn't see the

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.650 
thought perhaps they didn't see the
smoke<00:03:14.590> I<00:03:14.860> knew<00:03:15.550> it<00:03:15.700> was<00:03:15.850> going<00:03:16.090> up<00:03:16.180> in<00:03:16.360> the<00:03:16.420> sky

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
smoke I knew it was going up in the sky

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.240 
smoke I knew it was going up in the sky
but<00:03:16.900> it<00:03:17.020> was<00:03:17.140> white<00:03:17.380> smoke<00:03:17.680> that<00:03:17.980> might<00:03:18.130> be

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
but it was white smoke that might be

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.300 
but it was white smoke that might be
lost<00:03:18.460> in<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:18.850> blue<00:03:19.030> white<00:03:19.390> sky<00:03:19.750> or<00:03:20.050> or<00:03:20.530> was<00:03:20.950> it

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
lost in the blue white sky or or was it

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.070 
lost in the blue white sky or or was it
dark<00:03:21.700> an<00:03:21.880> oily<00:03:22.270> smoke<00:03:22.390> that<00:03:22.750> could<00:03:22.900> make<00:03:23.050> a

dark an oily smoke that could make a

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.530 
dark an oily smoke that could make a
smudge<00:03:23.410> against<00:03:23.710> the<00:03:23.890> blueness<00:03:24.280> there<00:03:25.180> was<00:03:25.360> no

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
smudge against the blueness there was no

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.770 
smudge against the blueness there was no
way<00:03:25.750> to<00:03:25.780> tell<00:03:26.520> if<00:03:27.520> only<00:03:27.910> there<00:03:28.090> was<00:03:28.240> some<00:03:28.420> oily

until they were dried they were too

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.620 
until they were dried they were too
tough<00:03:47.260> to<00:03:47.440> tear<00:03:47.620> off<00:03:47.740> the<00:03:47.920> tree<00:03:48.210> the<00:03:49.210> vines<00:03:49.450> of

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:19.960 
gone to hide in the sea grape this time

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.869 
gone to hide in the sea grape this time
however<00:07:20.199> the<00:07:20.409> aircraft<00:07:20.979> did<00:07:21.159> not<00:07:21.189> circle<00:07:21.729> back

00:07:21.869 --> 00:07:21.879 
however the aircraft did not circle back

00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:23.760 
however the aircraft did not circle back
it<00:07:22.270> did<00:07:22.389> not<00:07:22.479> make<00:07:22.689> another<00:07:22.990> low<00:07:23.199> pass<00:07:23.469> over

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:23.770 
it did not make another low pass over

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:26.070 
it did not make another low pass over
the<00:07:23.860> island<00:07:24.279> I<00:07:24.490> heard<00:07:25.120> the<00:07:25.270> sound<00:07:25.509> going<00:07:25.840> away

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080 
the island I heard the sound going away

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.860 
the island I heard the sound going away
and<00:07:26.379> soon<00:07:26.830> it<00:07:27.009> vanished<00:07:27.400> completely<00:07:27.779> then<00:07:28.779> I

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:28.870 
and soon it vanished completely then I

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:30.510 
and soon it vanished completely then I
realized<00:07:29.259> that<00:07:29.439> the<00:07:29.560> explosions<00:07:30.099> had<00:07:30.250> stopped

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:30.520 
realized that the explosions had stopped

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.600 
realized that the explosions had stopped
to<00:07:30.789> a<00:07:31.080> familiar<00:07:32.080> silence<00:07:32.740> settled<00:07:33.099> over<00:07:33.219> the<00:07:33.339> K

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:33.610 
to a familiar silence settled over the K

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:35.550 
to a familiar silence settled over the K
all<00:07:34.120> of<00:07:34.389> the<00:07:34.509> strength<00:07:34.810> went<00:07:35.050> out<00:07:35.139> of<00:07:35.259> my<00:07:35.379> body

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:35.560 
all of the strength went out of my body

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.679 
all of the strength went out of my body
it<00:07:35.919> was<00:07:36.159> the<00:07:36.310> first<00:07:36.550> real<00:07:36.789> chance<00:07:37.060> of<00:07:37.270> rescue

00:07:37.679 --> 00:07:37.689 
it was the first real chance of rescue

00:07:37.689 --> 00:07:40.800 
it was the first real chance of rescue
and<00:07:37.870> maybe<00:07:38.740> there<00:07:39.159> would<00:07:39.310> not<00:07:39.460> be<00:07:39.520> another<00:07:39.909> the

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:40.810 
and maybe there would not be another the

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.749 
and maybe there would not be another the
pilot<00:07:41.229> had<00:07:41.349> flown<00:07:41.589> away<00:07:41.620> perhaps<00:07:42.279> thinking<00:07:42.699> I

00:07:42.749 --> 00:07:42.759 
pilot had flown away perhaps thinking I

00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:44.550 
pilot had flown away perhaps thinking I
was<00:07:42.909> just<00:07:43.120> another<00:07:43.360> native<00:07:43.749> fisherman<00:07:44.199> waving

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:44.560 
was just another native fisherman waving

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.829 
was just another native fisherman waving
at<00:07:44.650> an<00:07:44.770> aircraft<00:07:44.919> I<00:07:45.550> knew<00:07:46.300> that<00:07:46.449> the<00:07:46.539> color<00:07:46.750> of

00:07:46.829 --> 00:07:46.839 
at an aircraft I knew that the color of

00:07:46.839 --> 00:07:50.129 
at an aircraft I knew that the color of
my<00:07:47.080> skin<00:07:47.139> was<00:07:47.529> very<00:07:47.589> dark<00:07:48.069> now<00:07:48.479> worse<00:07:49.479> I<00:07:49.839> knew

00:07:50.129 --> 00:07:50.139 
my skin was very dark now worse I knew

00:07:50.139 --> 00:07:51.420 
my skin was very dark now worse I knew
that<00:07:50.319> the<00:07:50.439> smoke<00:07:50.740> might<00:07:50.949> have<00:07:51.069> blotted<00:07:51.370> out

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:51.430 
that the smoke might have blotted out

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.959 
that the smoke might have blotted out
the<00:07:51.490> lines<00:07:51.819> of<00:07:52.029> rocks<00:07:52.270> that<00:07:52.449> spelled<00:07:52.900> help

00:07:53.959 --> 00:07:53.969 
the lines of rocks that spelled help
