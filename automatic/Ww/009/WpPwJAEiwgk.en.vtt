00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:40.449 
alright let's go we have a lot to cover

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:47.250 
alright let's go we have a lot to cover
let's<00:00:41.110> get<00:00:41.410> this<00:00:41.590> kitchen<00:00:41.920> party's<00:00:46.230> started

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
let's get this kitchen party's started

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.830 
let's get this kitchen party's started
okay<00:00:48.040> so<00:00:48.100> kitchen<00:00:48.550> cabinets<00:00:49.090> and<00:00:49.329> shelving

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
okay so kitchen cabinets and shelving

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.479 
okay so kitchen cabinets and shelving
can<00:00:50.020> be<00:00:50.110> tricky<00:00:50.440> because<00:00:50.890> once<00:00:51.250> you<00:00:51.370> get

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
can be tricky because once you get

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.490 
can be tricky because once you get
everything<00:00:51.730> in<00:00:52.059> there<00:00:52.210> it's<00:00:52.780> hard<00:00:53.110> to<00:00:53.320> imagine

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
everything in there it's hard to imagine

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.250 
everything in there it's hard to imagine
taking<00:00:53.950> it<00:00:54.250> all<00:00:54.370> out<00:00:54.579> and<00:00:54.730> restructuring<00:00:55.690> but

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
taking it all out and restructuring but

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.620 
taking it all out and restructuring but
that's<00:00:56.469> often<00:00:56.950> the<00:00:56.980> solution<00:00:57.700> if<00:00:58.270> there<00:00:58.480> is<00:00:58.600> a

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:58.630 
that's often the solution if there is a

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.750 
that's often the solution if there is a
strategy<00:00:59.290> behind<00:00:59.559> where<00:00:59.950> every<00:01:00.370> single<00:01:00.579> thing

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
strategy behind where every single thing

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.320 
strategy behind where every single thing
needs<00:01:01.180> to<00:01:01.329> go<00:01:01.480> but<00:01:02.260> to<00:01:02.649> back<00:01:02.920> up<00:01:03.309> the<00:01:03.910> first

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
needs to go but to back up the first

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.310 
needs to go but to back up the first
step<00:01:04.690> is<00:01:04.930> this<00:01:05.140> purge<00:01:05.950> lady<00:01:06.990> you've<00:01:07.990> done<00:01:08.170> it

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
step is this purge lady you've done it

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.200 
step is this purge lady you've done it
before<00:01:08.380> get<00:01:09.340> rid<00:01:09.460> of<00:01:09.490> the<00:01:09.640> things<00:01:09.880> that<00:01:10.090> you're

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
before get rid of the things that you're

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.810 
before get rid of the things that you're
honestly<00:01:10.780> not<00:01:11.110> ever<00:01:11.380> using<00:01:11.950> and<00:01:12.160> don't<00:01:12.520> forget

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
honestly not ever using and don't forget

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.460 
honestly not ever using and don't forget

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
accessible even though I'm splitting

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:48.480

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
I'll show you example for years I had

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.890 
I'll show you example for years I had
all<00:01:56.470> of<00:01:56.500> my<00:01:56.680> glasses<00:01:57.009> and<00:01:57.369> moms<00:01:57.549> over<00:01:57.820> here<00:01:58.150> but

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
all of my glasses and moms over here but

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.649 
all of my glasses and moms over here but
our<00:01:59.590> coffee<00:01:59.979> pot<00:02:00.340> and<00:02:00.729> our<00:02:00.909> tea<00:02:01.060> pot<00:02:01.090> were<00:02:01.450> over

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
our coffee pot and our tea pot were over

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.780 
our coffee pot and our tea pot were over
here<00:02:01.869> took<00:02:02.439> me<00:02:02.619> awhile<00:02:02.740> to<00:02:02.920> figure<00:02:03.130> out<00:02:03.520> that

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
here took me awhile to figure out that

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.819 
here took me awhile to figure out that
maybe<00:02:04.060> I<00:02:04.210> should<00:02:04.450> switch<00:02:04.570> them<00:02:04.900> and<00:02:05.439> now<00:02:05.770> we

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829 
maybe I should switch them and now we

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:07.750 
maybe I should switch them and now we
have<00:02:06.189> all<00:02:06.369> our<00:02:06.400> glasses<00:02:06.729> and<00:02:07.119> mugs
