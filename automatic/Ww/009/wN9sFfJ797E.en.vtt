00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
thighs in a little bit and it just gives

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.929 
thighs in a little bit and it just gives
an<00:01:59.640> overall<00:02:02.060> thinner<00:02:03.060> appearance<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:04.049> think

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
an overall thinner appearance I think

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
the brochure yet because I did these

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.870 
the brochure yet because I did these
demo<00:03:37.579> these<00:03:38.299> are<00:03:38.480> from<00:03:38.569> a<00:03:38.720> mum<00:03:38.930> and<00:03:39.880> they're

demo these are from a mum and they're
the<00:03:41.090> new<00:03:42.519> jeggings<00:03:43.870> so<00:03:44.870> they're<00:03:45.049> exactly<00:03:45.139> the

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
the new jeggings so they're exactly the

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.220 
the new jeggings so they're exactly the
same<00:03:45.799> concept<00:03:46.160> as<00:03:46.579> these<00:03:46.970> I<00:03:47.359> expected<00:03:48.079> them<00:03:48.200> to

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
same concept as these I expected them to

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.680 
same concept as these I expected them to
be<00:03:48.349> denim<00:03:49.090> but<00:03:50.090> they're<00:03:50.239> not<00:03:50.419> they're<00:03:50.660> just

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
be denim but they're not they're just

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.479 
be denim but they're not they're just
Navy<00:03:51.349> and<00:03:51.470> then<00:03:51.620> at<00:03:51.739> the<00:03:51.829> bottom<00:03:51.980> they've<00:03:52.310> got

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
Navy and then at the bottom they've got

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.390 
Navy and then at the bottom they've got
like<00:03:52.669> the<00:03:52.910> little<00:03:53.120> yellow<00:03:53.889> stitching<00:03:54.889> to<00:03:55.250> make

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
like the little yellow stitching to make

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.309 
like the little yellow stitching to make
it<00:03:55.519> look<00:03:55.669> like<00:03:55.790> jeans<00:03:56.150> I<00:03:56.510> honestly<00:03:57.169> thought

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
it look like jeans I honestly thought

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:58.659 
it look like jeans I honestly thought
they<00:03:57.440> were<00:03:57.530> gonna<00:03:57.620> be<00:03:57.709> denim<00:03:58.160> so<00:03:58.280> I'm<00:03:58.400> a<00:03:58.489> little

00:03:58.659 --> 00:03:58.669 
they were gonna be denim so I'm a little

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:02.619 
they were gonna be denim so I'm a little
bit<00:03:58.880> disappointed<00:03:59.060> in<00:03:59.510> that<00:03:59.569> but<00:04:01.450> hang<00:04:02.450> hi

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:02.629 
bit disappointed in that but hang hi

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:04.360 
bit disappointed in that but hang hi

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
these ones are just Navy so obviously

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.330

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
there is a big color difference if you

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.619 
there is a big color difference if you
can<00:04:07.519> say<00:04:07.819> like<00:04:09.790> they're<00:04:10.790> all<00:04:10.940> fallen<00:04:11.359> off<00:04:11.480> the

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:11.629 
can say like they're all fallen off the
