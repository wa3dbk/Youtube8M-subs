here<00:00:20.699> we<00:00:20.760> go<00:00:20.880> now<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.390> begin<00:00:21.539> with<00:00:21.720> let's<00:00:21.900> have

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
here we go now to begin with let's have

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.620 
here we go now to begin with let's have
a<00:00:22.050> look<00:00:22.199> at<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.529> bass<00:00:22.769> clef<00:00:23.220> itself<00:00:23.760> okay<00:00:24.090> now

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
a look at the bass clef itself okay now

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.150 
a look at the bass clef itself okay now
it's<00:00:24.810> really<00:00:25.140> important<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:25.710> know<00:00:25.740> think<00:00:26.099> of

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
it's really important you know think of

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.740 
it's really important you know think of
it<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.400> basic<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.789> how<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.029> want<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.449> could<00:00:27.630> be

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
it the basic of how you want it could be

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.179 
it the basic of how you want it could be
like<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:28.289> could<00:00:28.439> look<00:00:28.529> like<00:00:28.680> an<00:00:28.800> elephant's

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
like it could look like an elephant's

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.009 
like it could look like an elephant's
ear<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.490> some<00:00:29.670> people<00:00:30.000> or<00:00:30.119> backwards<00:00:30.510> see<00:00:30.779> with

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
ear to some people or backwards see with

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.900 
ear to some people or backwards see with
two<00:00:31.230> dots<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:32.040> doesn't<00:00:32.340> matter<00:00:32.460> just<00:00:32.550> try<00:00:32.850> and

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
two dots it doesn't matter just try and

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.220 
two dots it doesn't matter just try and
get<00:00:33.030> some<00:00:33.090> image<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.660> how<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.809> looks<00:00:33.960> like<00:00:34.110> in

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
get some image of how it looks like in

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.569 
get some image of how it looks like in
your<00:00:34.260> head<00:00:34.469> okay<00:00:34.620> now<00:00:34.950> what's<00:00:35.370> really

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
your head okay now what's really

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.280 
your head okay now what's really
important<00:00:36.059> is<00:00:36.180> where<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.510> begins<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:37.079> sort<00:00:37.260> of

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
important is where it begins it sort of

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.690 
important is where it begins it sort of
begins<00:00:37.410> with<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.739> little<00:00:37.920> bit<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.129> circle<00:00:38.520> and

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
begins with a little bit of a circle and

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.639 
begins with a little bit of a circle and
then<00:00:38.879> comes<00:00:39.180> back<00:00:39.390> down<00:00:39.600> yeah<00:00:39.960> now<00:00:40.410> what's

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
then comes back down yeah now what's

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.069 
then comes back down yeah now what's
really<00:00:40.829> important<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:41.730> where<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.210> begins<00:00:42.540> that

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
really important is where it begins that

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.350 
really important is where it begins that
depict<00:00:43.440> it's<00:00:43.620> where<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.309> other<00:00:44.520> notes<00:00:45.059> are

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
depict it's where the other notes are

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.500 
depict it's where the other notes are
found<00:00:45.809> on<00:00:46.020> this<00:00:46.170> stage<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:46.920> if<00:00:47.670> we<00:00:47.940> began<00:00:48.270> the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
found on this stage so if we began the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.479 
found on this stage so if we began the
basically<00:00:48.840> lower<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.649> we<00:00:49.770> started<00:00:50.129> from<00:00:50.280> the

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
basically lower and we started from the

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.850 
basically lower and we started from the
the<00:00:50.850> next<00:00:51.030> line<00:00:51.270> down<00:00:51.539> or<00:00:51.840> even<00:00:52.350> further<00:00:52.620> the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
the next line down or even further the

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.010 
the next line down or even further the
last<00:00:53.070> line<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.640> would<00:00:54.180> change<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.690> order<00:00:54.930> of

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
last line that would change the order of

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.900 
last line that would change the order of
notes<00:00:55.230> okay<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:55.649> it's<00:00:55.860> really<00:00:55.890> important<00:00:56.730> that

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
notes okay so it's really important that

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.200 
notes okay so it's really important that
it<00:00:57.539> starts<00:00:58.230> on<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.680> second<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.520> top<00:00:59.730> line<00:00:59.940> the

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
it starts on that second to top line the

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.689 
it starts on that second to top line the
fourth<00:01:00.750> line<00:01:01.170> up<00:01:01.500> okay<00:01:02.219> that's<00:01:02.430> really

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
fourth line up okay that's really

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.130 
fourth line up okay that's really
important<00:01:03.149> now<00:01:03.539> let's<00:01:03.660> have<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.780> look<00:01:03.930> at<00:01:03.989> what

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
important now let's have a look at what

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.590 
important now let's have a look at what
notes<00:01:04.409> are<00:01:04.589> going<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.769> be<00:01:04.830> on<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.280> lines<00:01:05.760> now

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
notes are going to be on the lines now

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.700 
notes are going to be on the lines now
we're<00:01:06.720> going<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.869> look<00:01:06.990> at<00:01:07.110> learning<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.409> bass

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
we're going to look at learning the bass

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.260 
we're going to look at learning the bass
clef<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.280> little<00:01:08.580> bit<00:01:08.670> quicker<00:01:08.909> than<00:01:09.000> what<00:01:09.180> we

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
clef a little bit quicker than what we

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.670 
clef a little bit quicker than what we
did<00:01:09.390> with<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.570> treble<00:01:09.750> clef<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.530> if<00:01:10.590> you've

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
did with the treble clef so if you've

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.410 
did with the treble clef so if you've
learned<00:01:10.920> one<00:01:11.159> it's<00:01:11.460> just<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.939> very<00:01:12.180> similar

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
learned one it's just a very similar

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.940 
learned one it's just a very similar
thing<00:01:12.689> just<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.049> notes<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.560> roofed<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.770> little

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
thing just the notes and roofed a little

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.920 
thing just the notes and roofed a little
bit<00:01:14.040> down<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.850> course<00:01:15.150> these<00:01:15.479> notes<00:01:15.780> are

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
bit down and of course these notes are

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.630 
bit down and of course these notes are
going<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.110> be<00:01:16.200> lower<00:01:16.439> in<00:01:16.710> pitch<00:01:17.159> than<00:01:17.220> the

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
going to be lower in pitch than the

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.280 
going to be lower in pitch than the
treble<00:01:17.939> clef<00:01:17.970> but<00:01:18.600> doesn't<00:01:18.840> make<00:01:18.900> sense<00:01:19.170> at

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
treble clef but doesn't make sense at

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.780 
treble clef but doesn't make sense at
the<00:01:19.380> end<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.650> video<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.189> let's<00:01:20.430> have<00:01:20.759> a
