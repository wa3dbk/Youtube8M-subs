00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:05.629
 hello greetings cyrus welcome to 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.629
 tibia 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.220
 today we will talk about the tweets 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.950
 the druids are the masters of the 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.810
 healing and nature throughout 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.760
 history have exercised their control 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.040
 about nature for the benefit of 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.750
 all human beings they are very 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.950
 skilled with healing and spells 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.900
 support for 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.180
 because of his focus on skills 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.340
 magic has a poor performance in the 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.130
 physical abilities but believe me not 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.200
 they need it 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.210
 as droid you have the advantage of uploading your 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.880
 magical level in a very fast way to 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.760
 just like the shorts and you also have a 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.680
 very high amount of mana also the 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.020
 droid has the largest catalog of 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.820
 runes that can create remember that 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.580
 the druyts are the only ones capable of 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.440
 create a balance and there are rand boys who 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.520
 they are infallible in the demon hunt 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.140
 and dragons 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.970
 also since we 're talking about runes 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.830
 they can use all the rounds that 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.080
 are in the game except the 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:04.020
 JONDE missile that is exclusive to 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.729
 paladins although lately they are not very 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.580
 used are also the only ones that can 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.380
 create healing runes plus the 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.420
 wright elders have the ability to 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.900
 enchant weapons with the ice element or 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.900
 the earth 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.390
 but you already know me and as always 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.630
 I look for the bad side to everything we will see 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.880
 what are its disadvantages one of the 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.130
 disadvantages is that your life points are 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.080
 regenerate very slowly and already being in the 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.580
 topic is also worth mentioning that you have 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.830
 very few points of life 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.410
 also your physical abilities go up 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.830
 slow but your shilling friend goes up even more 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.320
 slow 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.870
 another disadvantage is that you do not have 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.730
 a lot of capacity so do not be surprised 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.680
 if you need to return several times to 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.140
 type in case you have a line of 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.540
 flight 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.310
 a disadvantage that not many notice is 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.590
 that brits experts cost 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.880
 more than those of the 11 in terms of mana 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.829
 refers clearly 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.509
 and I also have to mention that at 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:03.549
 Like the surfers can not bring 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.469
 heavy armor therefore they use 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.470
 lighter armor and that means 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:09.509
 less defense 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.390
 but good out of all those 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.070
 disadvantages let's keep talking about the subject in 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.810
 Personally tweets are 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.360
 characters of the magical type that most 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.710
 they like thanks to their ice powers they 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.810
 It makes it very easy for me to level up in 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.880
 dragons and although the short ones are also 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.800
 they are strong I think that at levels 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.260
 high the droid has a certain advantage 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.080
 since it 's more useful for a team but 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.520
 well that 's everyone's opinion 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.710
 when a druid reaches level 20 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.380
 you can buy your promotion and win 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.270
 certain benefits the first and more 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.430
 remarkable is that you stop being a simple 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.100
 droid to become a wise the 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.170
 of the druid 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.810
 you also reduce your penalty of 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.360
 30% death related to the loss of 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.640
 experience plus your sol points 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.190
 regenerate faster and you also have what 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.860
 double is to say if you had 100 now 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.420
 you'll have 200 so this will not be very 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.849
 useful when creating runes 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.760
 and if that was not enough, his regeneration will be 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:08.190
 faster a normal droid regenerates a 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.900
 point of life every 12 seconds and two 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.450
 mana points every three seconds 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.580
 while a the bertruy regenerates a 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.340
 point of life every 12 seconds and two 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.140
 command points every two seconds what 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.420
 it's going to be a one second reduction 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.310
 in mana regeneration and you can 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.220
 It seems little but when you're doing 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.900
 runas you will notice it being trim is very 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.700
 entertaining and it's also pretty 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.040
 interesting at the time of being put on 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.410
 group since usually the droid 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.600
 assumes the position of healer and that 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.370
 has a great responsibility because 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.920
 is in your hands the life of the nike that 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.660
 is blocking monsters like now 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.489
 you know I do not recommend a profession in 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.739
 specific because all the 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.690
 professions have their pros and cons and 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.790
 that everyone has their tastes 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.980
 in a few words I do not think there's a 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.440
 better class than another is just a matter of 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.150
 likes see you in the next video 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.739
 remember change can you follow me on 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.269
 facebook or twitter and links the 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.180
 you find in the video description 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.920
 if you can and you want you can support me 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.310
 passing this video to your friends 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.010
 pole 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.030
 I am USA, have a good day, good afternoon 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.050

 -there is the tibia
