00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:09.580
 and now cristian Ã¡lvarez yours for 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.809
 break a good game if we see 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.280
 important in the sense that the 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:14.080
 Second, it gave us a lot of tranquility 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.190
 at the beginning of the second part and 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.009
 from here I think it's the other 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.140
 party not by the way that is the 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:21.430
 season that has scored the most goals in your 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.750
 sports career at the beginning of the year 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.699
 you said wants to be the best again 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.010
 central by goals at the moment is your best 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:29.199
 season for sensations good 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.180
 means that by getting more goals you do 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.980
 better season but yes that level 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.800
 individual as I find myself very very 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.570
 well this year 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.070
 and at a collective level, obviously the 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.989
 team also help is to say always 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.719
 that the team is doing well because at 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.860
 individual all players shine 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.910
 more and good 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.370
 for now we have gotten 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.440
 leaders let's hope no longer just in this 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.150
 position stationed season to 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.379
 third one was defeated because they had 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.760
 failed on two occasions to 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.930
 get leader that's important for the 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.870
 good wardrobe is important 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.440
 more or less in the end the important thing is 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.680
 be the first one at the end of the season 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.300
 we started to league very well being leaders 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.650
 we suffered a small blip and now I think 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.240
 that we are in a good line again 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.760
 I do not think it's more important to be in 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.290
 is in this good trajectory that not the 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.720
 fact of getting leaders right now 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.070
 this against the final season but 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.180
 of course, within 15 days , it's going 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.530
 approaching match against the real 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.240
 madrid and the images right now are 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.149
 well different 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.500
 and we also know a classic that does not 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.540
 it matters how one arrives and how the 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.460
 another at the end is a very different game 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.530
 to everything else and the trajectories of 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.299
 one and the other first missed the game of 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.180
 eibar that is going to be a very difficult field 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.560
 a team that has now taken a line 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.020
 bad results and I'm sure it's going to have 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.759
 really want to 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.409
 and turn this situation around and 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.689
 then try to score points because 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.750
 so you need to focus on this 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.119
 final match of leadership cup to point 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.320
 of qualifying season 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.490
 that at a certain time it had 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.049
 put a little bit bad with many 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.179
 criticisms this has been turned around by 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.159
 complete good when we already know that the 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:05.060
 football is like this not in two months can 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.110
 have can turn over completely 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.819
 It seems that this has been the case 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.890
 if we were to consider now start 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.720
 season and they told us that at the beginning of 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.200
 march march we would be in this 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.849
 situation we would sign it all now 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.709
 are missing these three months to follow and 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:23.450
 try for the end of season 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.450
 lift titles thanks to you
