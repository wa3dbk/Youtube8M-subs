00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.490
 ah 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.950
 hello youtube people good I bring you 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.960
 the video that I had promised 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:37.230
 about the main mobile air application 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.160
 I know that you can see here and 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.540
 the objective of this is to be able to record 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.870
 our screen of our device 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:49.650
 android and be able to visualize it in our 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.450
 computer so you can record without 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.809
 the need to have a camera 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.940
 video and can occupy a program for 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.829
 record the screen of your computer by 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:04.070
 example now I'm using the sing 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.070
 but you can occupy any 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:12.000
 whichever best suits 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.670
 good this application will attend that nothing 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.700
 I warn you that it is not completely 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.969
 movement fluid in device no 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.229
 be one hundred percent real time 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:23.659
 but if you meet that goal because there 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.929
 many applications for example 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:29.850
 screencast or video recorder that also 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:33.580
 they record the screen but in the case of 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.610

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.990

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.850
 let's see now why 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.630
 before opening the program 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.280
 we are going to save a folder in the 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.260

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.130
 finalize the installation that is that main 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.640
 we'll leave it there while in

 our cell phone 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.710
 we must connect the ucb cable to the 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:44.720
 computer 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.720
 and I have it with this, let's see 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:51.819
 good they should have connected 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.290
 and now we go 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:56.660
 to this folder 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:00.730
 I 'm going to move it 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:06.370
 it does not matter what this good opens the folder and 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:08.349
 Double click on this mobile run 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.010
 was going to appear below in the 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.010
 multiplication 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.950
 connecting to compute forgiveness to the cell 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.359
 and the application was being installed and 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.670
 tells us to review our sovereign 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.530
 and this will automatically appear 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.889
 without having done anything, it will open 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.470
 This application 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:29.729
 okay 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.400
 let's go back 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:35.120
 and this is not going to appear, we're going to leave the 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.120
 cell to the side 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.789
 and we put in the notification bar 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:41.789
 we search 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:48.980
 the identification of the mobile 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.980
 and we open a mobile 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.200
 we wait and s 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:00.819

00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:00.819
 we get the red screen 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:08.300
 well this we configure it from this 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.300
 way we go here 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.540
 we go to this option that I feel of salt 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:23.169
 and we go to the second option that I made 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:23.169
 edith setting trump shooting 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:30.760
 and it will close on the computer 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:33.790
 now here we must configure it 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:37.570
 let's open an option that says chang 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:41.470
 display in black screen we put you where 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:43.990
 is the ticket and we put the first 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:46.940
 option that text auto 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:49.280
 it's not going to come out this we play 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:52.529
 and now we put the fourth option that is 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.949
 the color display pad in color 

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:54.949

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:03.159
 and we are going to look like this window and 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:05.050
 we put the fourth option that says heretical 

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:07.780

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.340
 We put it and we will look as if 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.880
 I was fine 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:15.840
 we put it here we click 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.840
 and we are going back 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.870
 back again 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:22.639
 we put the cell phone aside 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:27.870
 let's record notifications 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:30.620
 we have here a click and we open 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.620

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.880
 of the android in our computer 

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:53.859
 well then if you want to stop digging 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.039
 closes the application only in the 

00:06:55.729 --> 00:07:00.530
