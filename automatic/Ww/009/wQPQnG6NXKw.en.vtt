down<00:01:06.990> here<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.470> can<00:01:07.650> study<00:01:07.830> with<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.220> group

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
down here you can study with the group

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.789 
down here you can study with the group
or<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.180> can<00:01:09.330> use<00:01:09.450> one<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.020> these<00:01:10.260> into<00:01:10.680> out

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
or you can use one of these into out

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.190 
or you can use one of these into out
your<00:01:11.040> rooms<00:01:11.220> maybe<00:01:11.610> teach<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.210> fake<00:01:12.390> class<00:01:12.780> and

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
your rooms maybe teach a fake class and

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.899 
your rooms maybe teach a fake class and
it<00:01:13.619> kind<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:13.890> sounds<00:01:14.130> like<00:01:14.189> someone's<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:14.670> here

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
it kind of sounds like someone's in here

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:23.320 
it kind of sounds like someone's in here
so<00:01:15.090> let's<00:01:15.240> check<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.720> out

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.690 

maybe<00:01:24.330> we<00:01:24.660> should<00:01:24.930> find<00:01:25.410> somewhere<00:01:26.100> else<00:01:26.160> to

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
maybe we should find somewhere else to

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.280 
maybe we should find somewhere else to
study<00:01:28.580> yes

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
study yes

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
study yes
make<00:01:31.290> sure<00:01:31.500> when<00:01:31.680> you're<00:01:31.800> finding<00:01:32.010> your<00:01:32.250> own

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
make sure when you're finding your own

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.950 
make sure when you're finding your own

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
studying habit that it's a healthy one

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.220 
studying habit that it's a healthy one
never<00:01:34.530> try<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:34.950> cram<00:01:35.340> hours<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.330> studying<00:01:36.750> the

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:37.230 
never try to cram hours of studying the

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.200 
never try to cram hours of studying the
night<00:01:37.470> before<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.920> test<00:01:37.980> it<00:01:38.580> doesn't<00:01:38.790> allow<00:01:39.180> for

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
night before a test it doesn't allow for

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:51.050 
night before a test it doesn't allow for
your<00:01:39.540> dendrites<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.200> grow

levels stay low and a great way to keep

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:00.059 
levels stay low and a great way to keep
those<00:01:58.149> stress<00:01:58.420> levels<00:01:58.780> low<00:01:58.929> are<00:01:59.350> to<00:01:59.710> stay

00:02:00.059 --> 00:02:00.069 
those stress levels low are to stay

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:26.820 
those stress levels low are to stay
healthy<00:02:00.399> and<00:02:01.289> exercise<00:02:02.289> at<00:02:02.649> the<00:02:02.950> Rec<00:02:03.100> Center

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.990 

if<00:02:27.830> you're<00:02:28.010> not<00:02:28.160> a<00:02:28.190> huge<00:02:28.400> fan<00:02:28.520> of<00:02:28.850> working

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
if you're not a huge fan of working

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
inside Truman State's campus has so many

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:42.990 
inside Truman State's campus has so many
opportunities<00:02:32.420> to<00:02:32.840> work<00:02:33.080> outside

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.930 

now<00:02:44.000> maybe<00:02:44.660> you're<00:02:44.959> not<00:02:45.140> into<00:02:45.349> exercising<00:02:46.280> but

now maybe you're not into exercising but

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.360 
now maybe you're not into exercising but
there<00:02:47.420> are<00:02:47.599> also<00:02:47.870> other<00:02:48.470> opportunities<00:02:49.160> to

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
there are also other opportunities to

00:02:49.370 --> 00:03:11.980 
there are also other opportunities to

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.720 

being<00:03:12.990> a<00:03:13.110> good<00:03:13.290> student<00:03:13.740> is<00:03:13.830> very<00:03:13.950> important

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
being a good student is very important

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.250 
being a good student is very important
but<00:03:14.970> you<00:03:15.090> also<00:03:15.240> need<00:03:15.510> to<00:03:15.570> balance<00:03:15.780> your<00:03:15.990> time

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
but you also need to balance your time

and do things that you enjoy if you

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.360 
and do things that you enjoy if you
don't<00:03:34.080> like<00:03:34.290> playing<00:03:34.560> outside<00:03:34.770> you<00:03:35.220> can
