00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.900
 motorcycle that is the 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.900
 and accuse of purity 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:20.020
 for people who are interested in 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.640
 acquire or just want to know how 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.130
 are this kind of 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.310
 of motorcycles because before I do 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.019
 get 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.800
 I found some informative video about 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.800
 these motorcycles 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.690
 I bring you this video so you know 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.410
 It has a 200-centimeter engine 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.530
 5-speed cubic 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:55.390
 that already good some knew 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.390
 for those who ask themselves saw 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.310
 I would raise a limit of 130 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:06.489
 kilometers per hour 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.489
 it's pretty good for displacements 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.780
 friends who have had moments like this 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.900
 of the stars so he can run 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.900
 a little more 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.900
 150 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.049
 I have not tried 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.540
 here they have 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.700
 Measures a meter 10 approximately by 2 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.509
 2 points 1 v 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.509
 the tree 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.730
 It has a fuel capacity of 2 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:51.150
 liters 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:51.150
 so it takes a liter 1,212 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.370
 and nothing then I bring the 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.150

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.570
 possible 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:09.810
 here I bring you the speed test 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.760
 I converted a little because there 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.750
