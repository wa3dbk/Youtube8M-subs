clips<00:01:20.580> i<00:01:20.670> think<00:01:20.850> you'll<00:01:20.970> see<00:01:21.000> are<00:01:21.780> from<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.710> game

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
clips i think you'll see are from a game

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.910 
clips i think you'll see are from a game
was<00:01:23.159> playing<00:01:23.490> against<00:01:23.939> cristiano<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.920> messy

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
was playing against cristiano and messy

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.760 
was playing against cristiano and messy
so<00:01:26.390> they<00:01:27.390> did<00:01:27.540> finally<00:01:27.930> go<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.049> another<00:01:28.350> messy

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
so they did finally go to another messy

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.429 
so they did finally go to another messy
and<00:01:28.950> that's<00:01:29.250> pretty<00:01:29.759> big<00:01:30.180> like<00:01:30.509> if<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.869> team<00:01:31.140> can

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
and that's pretty big like if a team can

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.340 
and that's pretty big like if a team can
do<00:01:31.619> well<00:01:31.890> against<00:01:32.790> those<00:01:33.000> two<00:01:33.210> players<00:01:33.479> you

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
do well against those two players you

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.960 
do well against those two players you
know<00:01:34.500> you've<00:01:34.650> made<00:01:34.860> something<00:01:35.189> pretty<00:01:35.579> decent

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
know you've made something pretty decent

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.910 
know you've made something pretty decent
