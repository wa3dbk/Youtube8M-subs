00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.760 

a<00:00:27.010> lot<00:00:27.970> of<00:00:28.000> students<00:00:28.480> didn't<00:00:28.810> understand<00:00:29.320> me<00:00:29.530> a

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:29.770 
a lot of students didn't understand me a

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.970 
a lot of students didn't understand me a
lot<00:00:30.430> of<00:00:30.460> them<00:00:30.820> left<00:00:31.300> there<00:00:32.230> were<00:00:32.320> others<00:00:32.710> have

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
lot of them left there were others have

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.890 
lot of them left there were others have
stayed<00:00:33.280> for<00:00:33.580> many<00:00:33.700> many<00:00:34.030> years<00:00:34.120> and<00:00:34.660> those

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:34.900 
stayed for many many years and those

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.270 
stayed for many many years and those
were<00:00:35.590> the<00:00:35.739> people<00:00:35.920> I<00:00:36.130> interviewed<00:00:36.670> in<00:00:37.210> depth

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
were the people I interviewed in depth

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.500 
were the people I interviewed in depth
and<00:00:39.280> those<00:00:39.460> were<00:00:39.580> the<00:00:39.700> people<00:00:39.970> I<00:00:40.030> really

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
and those were the people I really

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.120 
and those were the people I really
didn't<00:00:40.780> understand<00:00:41.170> because<00:00:41.559> they<00:00:41.830> all

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.130 
didn't understand because they all

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.650 
didn't understand because they all
seemed<00:00:42.520> to<00:00:42.550> be<00:00:42.730> talking<00:00:43.270> about<00:00:43.300> different

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
seemed to be talking about different

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.590 
seemed to be talking about different
things<00:00:44.050> and<00:00:44.320> it<00:00:44.470> took<00:00:44.620> about<00:00:44.800> a<00:00:45.040> decade<00:00:45.600> for

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
things and it took about a decade for

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.810 
things and it took about a decade for
the<00:00:47.050> different<00:00:47.440> things<00:00:47.710> that<00:00:47.890> they<00:00:48.100> said<00:00:48.430> to

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
the different things that they said to

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.729 
the different things that they said to
relate<00:00:49.540> to<00:00:49.570> each<00:00:49.780> other<00:00:50.080> enough<00:00:50.500> so<00:00:50.710> I

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
relate to each other enough so I

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:59.240 
relate to each other enough so I
understood<00:00:51.580> there<00:00:51.820> was<00:00:52.620> some<00:00:53.620> logic<00:00:54.309> to<00:00:54.519> this

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.810 

you<00:00:59.850> could<00:01:00.000> only<00:01:00.150> move<00:01:00.510> into<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.050> canvas

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
you could only move into the canvas

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.450 
you could only move into the canvas
spatially<00:01:03.260> diagonally<00:01:04.260> diagonally<00:01:05.160> to<00:01:05.430> the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
spatially diagonally diagonally to the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.000 
spatially diagonally diagonally to the
left<00:01:05.550> diagonally<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.780> right<00:01:07.050> through

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
left diagonally to the right through

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.050 
left diagonally to the right through
overlapping<00:01:08.580> su<00:01:09.360> shape<00:01:09.720> it's<00:01:10.590> true<00:01:10.770> color<00:01:11.100> and

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
overlapping su shape it's true color and

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.790 
overlapping su shape it's true color and
when<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.330> move<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.660> back<00:01:12.690> up<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.410> the<00:01:13.440> surface

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
when you move it back up to the surface

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.130 
when you move it back up to the surface
again<00:01:14.160> you<00:01:14.430> establish<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.210> certain<00:01:15.600> kind<00:01:15.960> of

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
again you establish a certain kind of

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.350 
again you establish a certain kind of
surface<00:01:16.770> tension<00:01:17.010> like<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.610> might<00:01:17.820> find<00:01:18.090> on

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
surface tension like you might find on

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.570 
surface tension like you might find on
an<00:01:18.510> apple<00:01:18.990> or<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.229> balloon<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:20.100> know<00:01:20.310> there's

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
an apple or a balloon you know there's

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.490 
an apple or a balloon you know there's
something<00:01:20.790> inside<00:01:21.300> it<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.690> there's<00:01:22.290> some

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
something inside it and there's some

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.010 
something inside it and there's some
idea<00:01:22.890> in<00:01:23.190> that<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.880> know<00:01:24.030> but<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.510> have<00:01:24.690> this

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
idea in that you know but you have this

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.230 
idea in that you know but you have this
surface<00:01:25.320> tension<00:01:25.800> that<00:01:26.310> makes<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.030> more

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
surface tension that makes it the more

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.880 
surface tension that makes it the more
powerful<00:01:27.740> experience

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
powerful experience

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.980 
powerful experience
then<00:01:29.400> just<00:01:29.729> say<00:01:29.970> illustrating<00:01:30.869> these

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
then just say illustrating these

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.080 
then just say illustrating these
beautiful<00:01:31.619> rocks<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.399> lovely<00:01:32.759> water

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
beautiful rocks and that lovely water

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.130 
beautiful rocks and that lovely water
and<00:01:33.420> BM<00:01:34.729> the<00:01:35.729> way<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.030> birds<00:01:36.270> are<00:01:36.509> flying<00:01:36.630> you

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
and BM the way the birds are flying you

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.630 
and BM the way the birds are flying you
know<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.320> can<00:01:37.560> illustrate<00:01:37.740> all<00:01:38.190> those<00:01:38.399> things

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
know you can illustrate all those things

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.370 
know you can illustrate all those things
but<00:01:38.790> how<00:01:38.970> do<00:01:39.030> they<00:01:39.180> actually<00:01:39.210> relate<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.020> each

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
but how do they actually relate to each

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.100 
but how do they actually relate to each
other<00:01:40.560> how<00:01:40.950> are<00:01:41.670> these<00:01:41.820> shapes<00:01:42.180> moving<00:01:42.540> into

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
other how are these shapes moving into

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.469 
other how are these shapes moving into
space<00:01:43.410> how<00:01:43.680> does<00:01:43.830> this<00:01:43.950> space<00:01:44.220> move<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:45.000> how

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
space how does this space move and how

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.230 
space how does this space move and how
does<00:01:45.539> that<00:01:45.899> change<00:01:45.960> your<00:01:46.530> perception<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.399> the

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
does that change your perception of the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.660 
does that change your perception of the
world<00:01:48.479> when<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:49.020> look<00:01:49.289> back<00:01:49.800> out<00:01:50.009> into<00:01:50.520> it

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
world when you look back out into it

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.960 
world when you look back out into it
again<00:01:51.030> because<00:01:51.660> our<00:01:52.110> changes<00:01:52.979> our<00:01:53.220> perception

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
again because our changes our perception

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.290 
again because our changes our perception
of<00:01:54.180> reality<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:55.080> that's<00:01:55.500> why<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.670> artists

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
of reality and that's why the artists

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.980 
of reality and that's why the artists
are<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.750> incredibly<00:01:58.590> important<00:01:59.100> today

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
are so incredibly important today

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.510 
are so incredibly important today
because<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.110> environment<00:02:01.740> is<00:02:01.920> changing<00:02:02.340> so

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
because the environment is changing so

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.120 
because the environment is changing so
radically<00:02:03.000> now<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:04.110> we<00:02:04.350> need<00:02:04.470> you<00:02:04.799> know<00:02:04.920> very

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
radically now and we need you know very

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.570 
radically now and we need you know very
fast<00:02:05.430> solutions<00:02:06.890> they<00:02:07.890> can<00:02:08.100> only<00:02:08.280> be<00:02:08.399> found

through the creative means and some of

how<00:02:20.140> we<00:02:20.920> move<00:02:21.280> through<00:02:21.790> our<00:02:22.180> environment<00:02:23.050> how

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
how we move through our environment how

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.410 
how we move through our environment how
