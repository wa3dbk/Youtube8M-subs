00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.139
 Welcome and welcome again 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.950
 I'm going to explain 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.950
 Cucumber pruning 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:20.350
 and cucumber is usually always left 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.350
 to a guide 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.100
 and it is very important 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.770
 that tutors 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.310
 You have to have a PhD in 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.310
 terms 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.550
 memory 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.550
 good 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.480
 let's normally catch the gazelle 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.860
 a secondary a secondary branch like 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.860
 in this case 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.100
 OK 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.100
 these secondary branches 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:03.640
 what it does blurs 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:08.910
 usually 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.910
 from the second or third sheet 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.740
 depending also on the variety that 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.740
 let's have 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:27.860
 so we can leave them then 34 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.330
 the 34 in secondary ladies always 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.830
 blunting from the second 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.450
 third sheet 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.900
 to those who do not know what is the 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.550
 blunt 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.550
 it's a similar thing done 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.760
 since we have a 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.360
 one of the simple ones that usually has 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.740
 here we have a secondary branch 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.540
 first to sheet 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:04.660
 second sheet and my case I 'll leave 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:08.210
 leave until the third leaf the blunt 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:10.490
 means cutting the tip 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.520
 agree in this case it will have 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:16.690
 here comes here has 2 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.240
 the future two future flowers 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.410
 here two 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.780
 and here others 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.780
 and from here, here we cut 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.110
 we put a pair of scissors because they are clean 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.110
 Of course 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.110
 and we cut 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.700
 we leave 45 centimeters from the 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.700
 flower 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.300
 and we force 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.660
 and this outbreak 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:03:00.660
 we are not going to enter 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:04.100
 it is very important tutorials 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.100
 the cucumber guide 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.069
 in this case he's carrying around here 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.440
 little by little 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.900
 this the truth is that it grows quite 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.080
 fast grows from 10 to 15 centimeters per 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.080
 day 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:32.660
 and with patience 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.660
 the results are being achieved 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.460
 already begins to sound bonus 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.130
 in some syllables, we can 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.130
 find up to three flowers 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.870
 how 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.870
 we are entering 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.040
 how 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.520
 and nothing else is normally seen at three or 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.520
 four 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.710
 branch 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.359
 always cut from the second 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.079
 third 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.079
 in agreement 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.419
 and nothing more 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:29.740
 I think it 's easy to understand 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.740
 Here we can see the flower in May 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.330
 one more flower 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.740
 one more flower or 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.949
 it looks like it has 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.949
 in 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.920
 now 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:52.950
 but the birth is fine 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:55.860
 and the flower females get encounter by 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:05:01.040
 here one that comes out is to notice that already 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:01.040
 comes already with a kind of dwarf pepito 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.080
 May 1 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:25.320
 here is one that is coming out but well 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:29.720
 the detail is all open 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.720
 there is a small finite 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.360
 and nothing more 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.360
 I 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:43.320
 how are they looking to hold on to any 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:45.650
 thing that finds that way they are 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.650
 our 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.850
 always wind brings 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.270
 the pilgrim pumpkin 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.120
 like mouth up 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:12.920
 it's amazing what grows the day is 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:15.400
 It's growing me between 15 to 20 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.400
 centimeters 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.660
 it has a lot 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:31.670
 notice that an open 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:34.600
 this is the pilgrim pumpkin flower 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:34.600
 see how pretty 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.400
 and nothing the friends 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:54.380
 in another video explaining the pruning of the 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.380
 eggplant 

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:59.349
 but they did not forget what he does in two 

00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:59.349
 different 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:06.200
 Well nothing more than a warm greeting 

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.200
 and 

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:12.220
 good cause and to all and to all 

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:12.220
 goodbye
