00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
where the first parts located they get

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.830 
where the first parts located they get
the<00:00:39.000> part<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.540> they<00:00:40.200> come<00:00:40.410> back<00:00:40.670> now<00:00:41.780> by<00:00:42.780> this

left which I was in that went to actor

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.130 
left which I was in that went to actor
as<00:01:14.280> well<00:01:14.310> not<00:01:15.210> knowing<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.630> first<00:01:15.810> group<00:01:16.020> was

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
as well not knowing the first group was

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.780 
as well not knowing the first group was
already<00:01:16.409> out<00:01:16.530> there<00:01:16.740> so<00:01:17.189> we<00:01:17.280> get<00:01:17.430> two<00:01:17.580> groups

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
already out there so we get two groups

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.130 
already out there so we get two groups
to<00:01:17.909> accurate<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.360> realized<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.900> we<00:01:18.990> just

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
to accurate and realized that we just

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.920 
to accurate and realized that we just
left<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.409> base<00:01:19.790> very<00:01:20.790> vulnerable<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.600> we're

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
left the base very vulnerable and we're

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.350 
left the base very vulnerable and we're
like<00:01:22.049> crap<00:01:22.470> everybody's<00:01:23.070> died<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:24.090> they<00:01:24.210> go

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
like crap everybody's died so they go

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.920 
like crap everybody's died so they go
back<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.810> base<00:01:25.070> sneaking<00:01:26.070> our<00:01:26.159> way<00:01:26.280> back

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
back to the base sneaking our way back

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.999 
back to the base sneaking our way back
zombies<00:01:27.930> are<00:01:28.080> everywhere<00:01:28.110> there's<00:01:28.829> just

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
be at least 30 and we look at the base

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.190 
be at least 30 and we look at the base
and<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.759> our<00:01:35.880> surprise<00:01:35.909> there's<00:01:36.720> two<00:01:36.900> people
