00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
something else that the weather actually

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.780 
something else that the weather actually
affects<00:00:35.969> how<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:36.270> play<00:00:36.840> because<00:00:37.610> if<00:00:38.610> you're

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
affects how you play because if you're

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.180

want<00:00:39.120> running<00:00:39.300> around<00:00:39.660> off<00:00:39.930> path<00:00:40.440> as<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:41.040> can

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
want running around off path as you can

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.250 
want running around off path as you can
see<00:00:41.399> that<00:00:41.550> will<00:00:41.640> happen<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.899> start<00:00:43.140> to

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
see that will happen is you start to

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.139 
see that will happen is you start to
actually<00:00:43.410> have<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.070> step<00:00:44.430> through<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.969> deep

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
actually have to step through the deep

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.160 
actually have to step through the deep
snow<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:46.190> again<00:00:47.190> get<00:00:47.460> was<00:00:47.640> long<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.239> that's

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
snow and again get was long and that's

snow and again get was long and that's
actually<00:00:49.320> i<00:00:49.530> think<00:00:49.620> it's<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.890> pretty<00:00:50.070> cool

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280
