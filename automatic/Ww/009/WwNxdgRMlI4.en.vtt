alright and let's see maybe something
better<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.250> time<00:01:29.310> around<00:01:30.049> or<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.110> github

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
better this time around or a github

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.740 
better this time around or a github
bottle<00:01:32.729> ultimate<00:01:34.490> well<00:01:35.490> it's<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:36.090> step<00:01:36.540> in<00:01:36.570> the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750

are<00:01:40.110> better<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.439> pull<00:01:40.650> than<00:01:41.009> super<00:01:41.610> rares

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869
