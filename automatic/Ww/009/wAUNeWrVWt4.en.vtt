good<00:03:32.160> but<00:03:32.640> I<00:03:32.700> still<00:03:33.030> think<00:03:33.209> we<00:03:33.269> need<00:03:33.299> to<00:03:33.450> go<00:03:33.540> and

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
good but I still think we need to go and

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.690 
good but I still think we need to go and
get<00:03:33.750> a<00:03:33.810> new<00:03:34.049> box<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.739> box<00:03:34.860> and<00:03:35.040> if<00:03:35.130> you're<00:03:35.310> a

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
get a new box the box and if you're a

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.170 
get a new box the box and if you're a

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
little bit just someone that was a bit

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.930 
little bit just someone that was a bit
more<00:03:39.299> dynamic<00:03:39.950> then<00:03:40.950> what<00:03:41.250> Frank<00:03:41.549> can<00:03:41.730> do<00:03:41.850> it

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940
