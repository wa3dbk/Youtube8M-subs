is a unix-based operating system let's
see<00:01:05.239> it<00:01:05.330> work<00:01:05.560> so<00:01:06.560> I<00:01:06.590> run<00:01:06.890> my<00:01:07.070> small<00:01:07.369> program

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
see it work so I run my small program

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.490 
see it work so I run my small program
that<00:01:08.060> I<00:01:08.090> call<00:01:08.329> a<00:01:08.359> cent<00:01:08.810> which<00:01:09.140> sends

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
that I call a cent which sends

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.440 
that I call a cent which sends
accelerometer<00:01:10.280> values<00:01:11.079> and<00:01:12.759> then<00:01:13.759> as<00:01:14.000> I<00:01:14.149> tilt

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
accelerometer values and then as I tilt

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.770 
accelerometer values and then as I tilt
the<00:01:14.659> ipod<00:01:14.990> for<00:01:15.289> the<00:01:16.039> modem<00:01:16.369> is<00:01:16.549> closed<00:01:16.850> whereas

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
the ipod for the modem is closed whereas

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.749 
the ipod for the modem is closed whereas
i<00:01:17.869> tilt<00:01:18.109> the<00:01:18.229> ipod<00:01:18.560> backwards<00:01:19.100> the<00:01:19.429> motors

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
i tilt the ipod backwards the motors

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.779 
i tilt the ipod backwards the motors
moves<00:01:20.030> backwards<00:01:21.100> this<00:01:22.100> works<00:01:22.340> the<00:01:22.520> same<00:01:22.549> way

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:22.789 
moves backwards this works the same way

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:24.910 
moves backwards this works the same way
for<00:01:23.119> the<00:01:23.210> steering<00:01:23.600> as<00:01:23.749> i<00:01:24.020> tilt<00:01:24.229> it<00:01:24.350> one<00:01:24.530> way<00:01:24.710> it

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
for the steering as i tilt it one way it

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.160 
for the steering as i tilt it one way it
steers<00:01:25.670> one<00:01:25.880> direction<00:01:26.329> and<00:01:26.509> as<00:01:26.689> i<00:01:26.749> tilt<00:01:27.049> it

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
steers one direction and as i tilt it

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.389 
steers one direction and as i tilt it
the<00:01:27.259> other<00:01:27.350> way<00:01:27.469> it<00:01:27.770> steers<00:01:28.100> the<00:01:28.249> other

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
the other way it steers the other

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:33.010 
the other way it steers the other
direction<00:01:30.999> inside<00:01:31.999> there's<00:01:32.270> just<00:01:32.479> a<00:01:32.569> standard

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
direction inside there's just a standard

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.499 
direction inside there's just a standard
servo<00:01:33.469> and<00:01:33.710> the<00:01:33.920> HC<00:01:34.249> 12<00:01:34.549> microcontroller<00:01:35.270> is

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
servo and the HC 12 microcontroller is

00:01:35.509 --> 00:02:19.470 
servo and the HC 12 microcontroller is
controlling<00:01:35.990> that<00:01:36.109> timing

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:39.229 

let's<00:02:20.480> do<00:02:20.630> some<00:02:20.840> range<00:02:21.110> testing

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.190 

so<00:02:40.239> that's<00:02:40.390> pretty<00:02:40.599> good<00:02:40.750> range<00:02:40.989> I'd<00:02:41.170> say<00:02:42.180> yeah

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
so that's pretty good range I'd say yeah

00:02:43.200 --> 00:03:01.040 
so that's pretty good range I'd say yeah
pretty<00:02:44.200> great<00:02:44.379> range

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:12.930 

that's<00:03:02.050> probably<00:03:02.260> really<00:03:02.590> bad<00:03:02.770> for<00:03:02.830> it<00:03:11.940> so

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
that's probably really bad for it so

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.290 
that's probably really bad for it so
again<00:03:13.480> my<00:03:13.840> name<00:03:14.020> is<00:03:14.050> John<00:03:14.530> boils<00:03:14.920> and<00:03:15.130> this<00:03:16.090> is

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
again my name is John boils and this is

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.960 
again my name is John boils and this is
WR<00:03:16.870> tilty<00:03:17.290> my<00:03:17.770> ipod<00:03:18.160> controlled<00:03:18.610> remote
