00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.799
 today we want to talk about flowering 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.900
 of the cherry trees in the valley of jerte 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.000
 but not in the usual way we want 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.830
 tell them why the flowering happens in 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.200
 this time of year and most importantly 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.509
 if the flowering has been lost the few 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.060
 sites where there are still cherry trees 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:30.170
 flourish during this weekend that 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.000
 you can have a good weekend to 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.650
 visit him who brings us more details 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.920
 then our Extremadura JosÃ© Miguel 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.920
 gallant 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.050
 in these famous dates where there are 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.570
 the cherry blossom festival in the valley 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.360
 of jerte and judging by the images 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:50.020
 that we find there these days is not 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:54.070
 for less that party and that fame is 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:57.340
 party dates back to the year 1972 the first 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.680
 cherry blossom party they had 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.520
 in the jerte we saw it on television 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:07.390
 Spanish images of that time and 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:09.610
 during these 42 years we have had the 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.340
 opportunity to see flowering as 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.130
 happens to color but on TV because in 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.200
 the reality there we still find 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:21.420
 that beautiful white color that has passed a 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.420
 altered over the years 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.939
 so let's get a little closer to 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.979
 The area of the Jerte Valley in CÃ¡ceres 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:30.470
 to discover the secrets that he keeps 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.270
 this flowering good so that the 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.630
 cherry blossoms need to pass 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.340
 during the winter between 900 and 1100 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.119
 hours with temperatures that oscillate between 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:44.390
 the 0 and approximately the 6 degrees a 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.789
 Once this happens, everything depends on the 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.630
 time when the cherry arrives in the sun 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:52.369
 it blooms and approximately lasts about 10 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.590
 days in this time between mid 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.409
 March and early April not all 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.509
 years is at the same time but it happens 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.729
 one thing there are three areas in which 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.709
 it has not yet flowered the cherry tree are 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.860
 the colder areas of jerte especially 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:08.929
 in the area of barrado cabrero and 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.670
 especially in the one from tornavacas to 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.049
 starting on Sunday it seems that the 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.269
 anticyclone is going to impose on the 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:16.130
 peninsula would reach the sun these areas 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:19.580
 would flourish especially in tornavacas 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.440
 we would have 10 km of cherry blossoms is 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.620
 the most closed area of the valley through which 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.959
 we would then have the two walls of the 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.680
 valley full of white color so 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.810
 now 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.180
 this date we will find for the 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.519
 one hand coming week cherry 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.409
 in bloom of those three zones and on the other the 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.390
 rest of the valley will keep what 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:40.489
 that is, the rain of petals 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.709
 all the petals of the flower falling to 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:46.390
 soil and the whole valley stays 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:48.190
 practically as if it were snowy 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.990
 Well, you can write down the agenda here 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.640
 there are areas where the 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.240
 cherry blossom in the valley of the 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.240
 jerte seco
