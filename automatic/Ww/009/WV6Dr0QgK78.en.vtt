you in the water

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.550 
you in the water
and<00:01:55.470> those<00:01:56.340> drawn<00:01:57.330> more<00:01:57.600> while<00:01:57.900> you<00:01:58.140> are<00:01:58.320> so

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
and those drawn more while you are so

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:11.490 
and those drawn more while you are so
beautifully<00:01:59.190> depicted<00:02:00.150> in<00:02:00.540> this<00:02:00.720> game

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.770 

one<00:02:12.250> thing<00:02:12.400> that<00:02:12.550> you<00:02:12.580> that's<00:02:13.300> not<00:02:13.480> actually

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
one thing that you that's not actually

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.990 
one thing that you that's not actually
shown<00:02:14.230> in<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.530> demo<00:02:14.740> but<00:02:15.130> is<00:02:15.370> something<00:02:15.850> that

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
shown in the demo but is something that

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.450 
shown in the demo but is something that
I<00:02:16.660> know<00:02:17.080> some<00:02:17.380> people<00:02:17.590> are<00:02:17.650> probably<00:02:17.830> going<00:02:18.370> to

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
I know some people are probably going to

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.550 
I know some people are probably going to
ask<00:02:18.580> about<00:02:18.790> but<00:02:19.150> this<00:02:19.690> game<00:02:19.930> will<00:02:20.170> allow<00:02:20.500> you

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
ask about but this game will allow you

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.050 
ask about but this game will allow you
to<00:02:21.370> do<00:02:21.940> real-time<00:02:22.590> transformations<00:02:24.000> so<00:02:25.000> you

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
to do real-time transformations so you

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.720 
to do real-time transformations so you
can<00:02:25.360> actually<00:02:25.630> invoke<00:02:26.530> like<00:02:27.220> super<00:02:27.520> saiyan

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
can actually invoke like super saiyan

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:44.630 
can actually invoke like super saiyan
low<00:02:27.940> and<00:02:28.240> things<00:02:28.390> like<00:02:28.540> that<00:02:28.600> oh<00:02:31.260> nice

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.130 

then<00:02:45.640> you<00:02:45.730> know<00:02:45.850> obviously<00:02:45.880> Dragon<00:02:46.870> Ball<00:02:46.990> has

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
then you know obviously Dragon Ball has

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.250 
then you know obviously Dragon Ball has
always<00:02:47.410> been<00:02:47.590> a<00:02:47.650> very<00:02:47.920> fast-paced<00:02:49.260> fighting

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
always been a very fast-paced fighting

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.130 
always been a very fast-paced fighting
experience<00:02:50.500> but<00:02:50.980> this<00:02:51.160> game<00:02:51.370> I<00:02:51.840> think<00:02:52.840> dimps

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
experience but this game I think dimps

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.830 
experience but this game I think dimps
is<00:02:53.260> really<00:02:53.560> really<00:02:54.460> common<00:02:54.910> improved<00:02:55.540> even

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
is really really common improved even

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.920 
is really really common improved even
than<00:02:56.050> making<00:02:56.200> it<00:02:56.410> even<00:02:56.800> faster<00:02:57.220> and<00:02:57.820> more<00:02:58.030> more

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
than making it even faster and more more

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.040 
than making it even faster and more more
quick<00:02:59.580> getting<00:03:00.580> into<00:03:00.820> the<00:03:00.880> battles<00:03:01.270> much<00:03:01.810> more

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
quick getting into the battles much more

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.750 
quick getting into the battles much more
intense<00:03:03.240> something<00:03:04.240> it's<00:03:04.540> going<00:03:04.690> to<00:03:04.750> be<00:03:04.870> a

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
intense something it's going to be a

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.980 
intense something it's going to be a
really<00:03:06.760> fun<00:03:06.790> yeah<00:03:07.720> they<00:03:08.380> got<00:03:08.590> in
