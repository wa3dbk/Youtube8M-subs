00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
come off you can remove this tip this

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.880 
come off you can remove this tip this
participate<00:02:07.649> better<00:02:09.050> but<00:02:10.050> without<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.530> tip

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
participate better but without the tip

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.090 
participate better but without the tip
you<00:02:11.039> can<00:02:11.190> get<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.370> little<00:02:11.610> bit<00:02:11.849> closer

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
you can get a little bit closer

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.210 
you can get a little bit closer
with<00:02:13.250> some<00:02:13.520> thinner<00:02:13.760> lines<00:02:14.860> you<00:02:15.860> can<00:02:16.010> actually

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
with some thinner lines you can actually

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.330 
with some thinner lines you can actually
use<00:02:16.460> this<00:02:17.500> if<00:02:18.500> I'm<00:02:18.950> correct<00:02:19.310> I'm<00:02:20.230> I<00:02:21.250> think<00:02:22.250> this

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
use this if I'm correct I'm I think this

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.000 
use this if I'm correct I'm I think this
is<00:02:22.460> a<00:02:22.490> point<00:02:22.850> five<00:02:23.210> needle<00:02:23.810> you<00:02:24.410> get<00:02:24.620> down<00:02:24.740> to

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
is a point five needle you get down to

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.890 
is a point five needle you get down to
small<00:02:26.000> as<00:02:26.180> a<00:02:26.210> point<00:02:26.630> to<00:02:26.840> needle<00:02:27.290> I<00:02:27.470> believe<00:02:28.900> but

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
small as a point to needle I believe but

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.680 
small as a point to needle I believe but
anyways<00:02:30.230> that<00:02:30.470> you<00:02:30.590> can<00:02:30.850> then<00:02:31.850> needle<00:02:32.420> in<00:02:32.570> it

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
anyways that you can then needle in it

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.120 
anyways that you can then needle in it
is<00:02:32.840> basically<00:02:33.290> a<00:02:33.320> needle<00:02:33.620> that<00:02:33.710> goes<00:02:33.770> all<00:02:34.100> the

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
is basically a needle that goes all the

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.070 
is basically a needle that goes all the
way<00:02:34.280> through<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.850> center<00:02:35.510> of<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.660> airbrush

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
way through the center of the airbrush

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.550 
way through the center of the airbrush
remove<00:02:39.080> this<00:02:39.290> and<00:02:40.600> there<00:02:41.600> it<00:02:41.720> is<00:02:41.870> as<00:02:42.170> you<00:02:42.440> can

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
remove this and there it is as you can

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.280 
remove this and there it is as you can
see<00:02:42.830> right<00:02:42.860> there<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:44.350> needle<00:02:45.350> and<00:02:45.560> then

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
see right there the needle and then

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.400 
see right there the needle and then
remove<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.350> tip<00:02:48.680> and<00:02:49.390> most<00:02:50.390> y'all<00:02:50.660> cannot<00:02:51.080> see

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
remove the tip and most y'all cannot see

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.170 
remove the tip and most y'all cannot see
that<00:02:51.560> but<00:02:51.770> there<00:02:51.920> is<00:02:52.040> a<00:02:52.070> tiny<00:02:52.460> needle<00:02:52.910> sticking

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
that but there is a tiny needle sticking

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.850 
that but there is a tiny needle sticking
out<00:02:53.330> right<00:02:53.390> there<00:02:53.690> that<00:02:54.290> needle<00:02:54.560> is<00:02:54.620> very

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
out right there that needle is very

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.010 
out right there that needle is very
sharp<00:02:55.250> learn<00:02:55.970> that<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.270> hard<00:02:56.300> way<00:02:56.540> when<00:02:56.900> I

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
sharp learn that the hard way when I

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.620 
sharp learn that the hard way when I
first<00:02:57.260> started<00:02:57.620> using<00:02:57.770> it<00:02:58.390> actually<00:02:59.390> start

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
first started using it actually start

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.010 
first started using it actually start
bleeding<00:02:59.900> it's<00:03:00.320> pretty<00:03:00.500> sharp<00:03:00.800> but<00:03:01.840> yes<00:03:02.840> you

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
bleeding it's pretty sharp but yes you

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.650 
bleeding it's pretty sharp but yes you
will<00:03:03.200> need<00:03:03.350> to<00:03:03.560> if<00:03:03.860> you<00:03:04.100> bend<00:03:04.550> that<00:03:04.820> that<00:03:05.420> could

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
will need to if you bend that that could

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.940 
will need to if you bend that that could
cause<00:03:05.930> some<00:03:06.590> splatters<00:03:07.160> and<00:03:08.380> kid<00:03:09.380> ruin<00:03:09.800> a

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
cause some splatters and kid ruin a

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.290 
cause some splatters and kid ruin a
paint<00:03:10.220> job<00:03:10.310> so<00:03:10.700> you<00:03:10.730> got<00:03:10.910> to<00:03:11.000> be<00:03:11.060> really

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
paint job so you got to be really

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.730 
paint job so you got to be really
careful<00:03:11.330> about<00:03:11.660> that<00:03:11.810> another<00:03:12.140> thing<00:03:12.440> I<00:03:12.590> like
