I'm gonna review the theater the answer
true<00:00:06.779> of<00:00:06.839> edition<00:00:07.410> and<00:00:07.620> I<00:00:08.460> would<00:00:08.639> do<00:00:08.790> a

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:08.929 
true of edition and I would do a

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:12.919 
true of edition and I would do a
comparison<00:00:10.160> between<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.700> true<00:00:12.120> events<00:00:12.750> and

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
comparison between the true events and

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.799 
comparison between the true events and
Heiser<00:00:13.139> I<00:00:13.730> because<00:00:14.730> in<00:00:14.969> my<00:00:15.089> opinion<00:00:15.299> they<00:00:15.780> are

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
Heiser I because in my opinion they are

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.830 
Heiser I because in my opinion they are
both<00:00:16.139> extraordinary<00:00:17.060> dynamic<00:00:18.060> driver<00:00:18.330> in

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
both extraordinary dynamic driver in

both extraordinary dynamic driver in
your<00:00:19.080> monitor<00:00:19.260> for<00:00:20.130> me<00:00:20.220> they<00:00:20.369> are<00:00:20.460> like<00:00:20.580> king

and queen and well my 800 is quite

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.029 
and queen and well my 800 is quite
special<00:00:26.400> because<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:27.689> changed<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:28.830> it's

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
special because I changed that it's

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.770 
special because I changed that it's
cable<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:30.090> put<00:00:30.359> on<00:00:30.539> some<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.439> pair<00:00:31.949> of

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
cable and I put on some a pair of

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.209 
cable and I put on some a pair of
silicon<00:00:34.010> custom<00:00:35.010> emote<00:00:35.460> on<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:36.059> would<00:00:36.989> do<00:00:37.110> a

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
silicon custom emote on it I would do a

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.940 
silicon custom emote on it I would do a
review<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.550> my<00:00:38.730> hundred<00:00:39.420> later<00:00:39.600> but<00:00:40.530> now<00:00:40.710> back

the<00:00:49.940> answer<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.210> Edition<00:00:51.750> first<00:00:52.760> so<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:55.760> think

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
the answer to Edition first so I think

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:04.660 
the answer to Edition first so I think
the<00:00:59.340> truth<00:00:59.699> has<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:01.969> glorious<00:01:02.969> appearance<00:01:03.840> it's

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
the truth has a glorious appearance it's

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.520 
the truth has a glorious appearance it's
beautifully<00:01:05.670> designed<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:07.110> polished

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
beautifully designed it the polished

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.240 
beautifully designed it the polished
wood<00:01:07.740> metal<00:01:07.920> chamber<00:01:08.549> it's<00:01:09.170> it<00:01:10.170> feels<00:01:10.890> very

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
wood metal chamber it's it feels very

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.940 
wood metal chamber it's it feels very
good<00:01:11.700> very<00:01:11.970> solid<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:14.960> the<00:01:15.960> cable<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:16.710> quite

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
good very solid and the cable is quite

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.490 
good very solid and the cable is quite
rubbery<00:01:17.900> but<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.140> helps<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.740> reduce<00:01:19.920> the

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
rubbery but it helps to reduce the

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.219 
rubbery but it helps to reduce the
microphone<00:01:22.500> neck<00:01:22.740> noise<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:24.860> on<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:26.369> aspect

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
microphone neck noise and on this aspect

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.170 
microphone neck noise and on this aspect
the<00:01:28.229> truth<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.799> much<00:01:29.460> better<00:01:29.729> than<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.150> eye

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180

signature for example this this pact

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.850 
signature for example this this pact
with<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:57.810> blue<00:01:58.200> color<00:01:58.469> inside<00:01:59.299> they<00:02:00.860> reduced

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
with the blue color inside they reduced

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.620 
with the blue color inside they reduced
it<00:02:02.509> some<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.840> treble<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:05.180> enhanced<00:02:06.180> the

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
it some of the treble and enhanced the

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.419 
it some of the treble and enhanced the
meat<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.469> bass

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
meat and bass

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.809 
meat and bass
but<00:02:10.179> I<00:02:10.209> don't<00:02:10.509> really<00:02:10.660> like<00:02:10.869> them<00:02:11.530> because<00:02:11.819> it

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
but I don't really like them because it

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.770 
but I don't really like them because it
makes<00:02:13.150> that<00:02:13.540> crew<00:02:14.319> sounds<00:02:14.950> less<00:02:15.250> clear<00:02:15.610> and<00:02:15.970> a

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
makes that crew sounds less clear and a

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.680 
makes that crew sounds less clear and a
bit<00:02:17.080> too<00:02:17.260> booming<00:02:17.769> I<00:02:18.150> still<00:02:19.150> prefer<00:02:19.330> the

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
bit too booming I still prefer the

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.350 
bit too booming I still prefer the
original<00:02:20.349> one<00:02:20.530> because<00:02:20.950> they<00:02:21.160> sound<00:02:21.550> most

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
original one because they sound most

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.460 
original one because they sound most
balanced<00:02:22.870> it<00:02:22.989> to<00:02:23.110> me

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
balanced it to me

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.869 
balanced it to me
and<00:02:25.140> there<00:02:26.140> are<00:02:26.230> also<00:02:26.440> two<00:02:26.590> carrying<00:02:27.220> case<00:02:27.489> but

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
and there are also two carrying case but

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.030 
and there are also two carrying case but
I<00:02:28.120> only<00:02:28.750> have<00:02:29.019> one<00:02:29.230> of<00:02:29.379> them<00:02:29.410> in<00:02:29.650> key<00:02:29.769> you<00:02:29.890> know

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
I only have one of them in key you know

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.410 
I only have one of them in key you know
it's<00:02:30.730> one<00:02:31.330> is<00:02:31.480> a<00:02:32.170> letter<00:02:32.950> case<00:02:33.310> and<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:34.269> other

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
it's one is a letter case and the other

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.039 
it's one is a letter case and the other
one<00:02:34.629> is<00:02:34.810> a<00:02:34.959> hot<00:02:35.200> case<00:02:35.530> with<00:02:35.920> zipper<00:02:36.459> I

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
one is a hot case with zipper I

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.140 
one is a hot case with zipper I
personally<00:02:38.049> like<00:02:38.290> this<00:02:39.129> zipper<00:02:39.700> case<00:02:39.879> more

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
personally like this zipper case more

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.650 
personally like this zipper case more
than<00:02:40.209> the<00:02:40.540> latter<00:02:40.780> one<00:02:41.019> because<00:02:41.319> it's<00:02:41.560> more<00:02:41.890> as

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
than the latter one because it's more as

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.960 
than the latter one because it's more as
say<00:02:43.660> it's<00:02:44.500> smaller<00:02:44.890> and<00:02:45.190> easier<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.760> carry

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
say it's smaller and easier to carry

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.259 
say it's smaller and easier to carry
around<00:02:46.349> the<00:02:47.349> latter<00:02:47.860> one<00:02:48.069> is<00:02:48.099> just<00:02:48.610> so<00:02:49.000> big

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
around the latter one is just so big

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.440 
around the latter one is just so big
like<00:02:49.480> it<00:02:49.660> like<00:02:50.290> a<00:02:50.319> little<00:02:50.709> box<00:02:51.010> it's<00:02:51.910> not<00:02:52.030> easy

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
like it like a little box it's not easy

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.720 
like it like a little box it's not easy
to<00:02:52.599> put<00:02:52.750> inside<00:02:53.200> ok<00:02:53.799> and<00:02:54.280> uh<00:02:56.340> yeah<00:02:57.340> time<00:02:57.610> to

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
to put inside ok and uh yeah time to

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.619 
to put inside ok and uh yeah time to
talk<00:02:57.910> about<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.329> sound<00:02:58.930> performance<00:03:00.629> but

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:01.629 
talk about the sound performance but

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.890 
talk about the sound performance but
first<00:03:01.870> of<00:03:02.049> all<00:03:02.319> I<00:03:02.349> have<00:03:02.709> to<00:03:02.890> say<00:03:02.920> that<00:03:03.900> the

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
first of all I have to say that the

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.970 
first of all I have to say that the
answer<00:03:05.079> truth<00:03:05.590> Edition<00:03:06.129> takes<00:03:06.430> a<00:03:07.379> very<00:03:08.379> long

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
answer truth Edition takes a very long

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.850 
answer truth Edition takes a very long
time<00:03:09.310> of<00:03:09.730> burning<00:03:10.000> to<00:03:10.750> brings<00:03:11.019> out<00:03:11.260> its<00:03:11.530> best

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
time of burning to brings out its best

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.879 
time of burning to brings out its best
performance<00:03:12.209> it's<00:03:13.209> about<00:03:13.709> how<00:03:14.709> sale<00:03:15.010> at<00:03:15.579> least

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
performance it's about how sale at least

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:21.150 
performance it's about how sale at least
150<00:03:17.889> hours<00:03:18.130> of<00:03:18.579> burning<00:03:19.260> it<00:03:20.260> will<00:03:20.470> improve<00:03:20.859> a

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
150 hours of burning it will improve a

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.229 
150 hours of burning it will improve a
lot<00:03:21.489> and<00:03:22.410> when<00:03:23.410> it's<00:03:23.560> stabilized<00:03:24.489> it<00:03:24.849> I<00:03:25.030> will

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
lot and when it's stabilized it I will

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.309 
lot and when it's stabilized it I will
say<00:03:25.450> that<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:27.430> audio<00:03:27.760> performance<00:03:28.090> is<00:03:28.630> truly

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
say that the audio performance is truly

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.270 
say that the audio performance is truly
excellent<00:03:30.329> it<00:03:31.329> has<00:03:31.840> sort<00:03:32.170> of<00:03:32.260> a<00:03:32.470> crystal<00:03:33.069> clear

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
excellent it has sort of a crystal clear

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.809 
excellent it has sort of a crystal clear
and<00:03:33.849> airy<00:03:34.209> sound<00:03:34.630> signature<00:03:35.079> it's<00:03:35.620> a<00:03:35.980> bit

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
and airy sound signature it's a bit

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.699 
and airy sound signature it's a bit
similar<00:03:36.970> to<00:03:37.299> the<00:03:37.420> AKG<00:03:37.959> K<00:03:38.500> 303<00:03:39.489> and<00:03:39.930> I<00:03:40.930> can<00:03:41.500> hear

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
similar to the AKG K 303 and I can hear

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.620 
similar to the AKG K 303 and I can hear
so<00:03:42.130> much<00:03:42.430> details<00:03:43.090> from<00:03:44.280> this<00:03:45.280> little<00:03:45.790> I<00:03:46.030> am

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
so much details from this little I am

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:52.039 
so much details from this little I am
it's<00:03:47.280> even<00:03:48.280> more<00:03:48.639> detail<00:03:49.060> than<00:03:49.239> the<00:03:49.419> 800<00:03:49.720> and

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
it's even more detail than the 800 and

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.430 
it's even more detail than the 800 and
those<00:03:53.049> finest<00:03:53.769> detail<00:03:54.220> like<00:03:55.060> the<00:03:55.359> harmonic<00:03:56.200> of

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
those finest detail like the harmonic of

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.940 
those finest detail like the harmonic of
the<00:03:57.000> sound<00:03:58.000> of<00:03:58.209> the<00:03:58.480> string<00:03:58.870> on<00:03:59.169> violin<00:03:59.709> or

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
the sound of the string on violin or

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.970 
the sound of the string on violin or
guitar<00:03:59.980> is<00:04:00.669> just<00:04:01.060> so<00:04:01.359> clear<00:04:01.840> and<00:04:04.769> besides<00:04:05.769> that

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
guitar is just so clear and besides that

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.229 
guitar is just so clear and besides that
the<00:04:06.220> truth<00:04:06.519> has<00:04:07.000> the<00:04:07.840> most<00:04:08.079> powerful<00:04:08.680> and

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
the truth has the most powerful and

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.990 
the truth has the most powerful and
punchy<00:04:10.239> bass<00:04:10.720> that<00:04:11.620> I<00:04:11.680> have<00:04:11.919> never<00:04:12.250> heard<00:04:12.730> in

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
punchy bass that I have never heard in

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.279 
punchy bass that I have never heard in
other<00:04:13.180> I<00:04:13.299> am<00:04:13.660> before<00:04:15.060> the<00:04:16.060> spate<00:04:16.419> the<00:04:16.750> speed<00:04:17.049> of

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.289 
other I am before the spate the speed of

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:20.860 
other I am before the spate the speed of
the<00:04:17.590> bass<00:04:17.799> is<00:04:18.039> very<00:04:18.070> fast<00:04:18.789> it's<00:04:19.539> very

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
the bass is very fast it's very

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.330 
the bass is very fast it's very
clear<00:04:21.560> and<00:04:22.490> but<00:04:23.300> but<00:04:23.600> I<00:04:23.720> won't<00:04:23.930> say<00:04:24.199> it's<00:04:24.530> it's

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
clear and but but I won't say it's it's

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:32.580 
clear and but but I won't say it's it's
better<00:04:25.790> than<00:04:26.380> 800<00:04:27.380> cuz<00:04:29.530> the<00:04:30.530> base<00:04:30.770> of<00:04:31.090> 800<00:04:32.090> is

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
better than 800 cuz the base of 800 is

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.580 
better than 800 cuz the base of 800 is
to<00:04:33.590> say<00:04:33.770> it's<00:04:34.010> sink<00:04:34.570> slightly<00:04:35.570> deeper<00:04:36.169> than

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
to say it's sink slightly deeper than

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.680 
to say it's sink slightly deeper than
the<00:04:36.860> truth<00:04:37.220> and<00:04:37.550> it<00:04:38.180> has<00:04:38.590> a<00:04:39.590> greater<00:04:40.370> momentum

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
the truth and it has a greater momentum

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.290 
the truth and it has a greater momentum
it<00:04:42.440> just<00:04:42.830> sounds<00:04:43.250> more<00:04:43.430> glorious<00:04:44.060> than<00:04:44.240> the

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
it just sounds more glorious than the

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.500 
it just sounds more glorious than the
truth<00:04:45.460> but<00:04:46.460> there<00:04:46.669> are<00:04:46.729> two<00:04:46.880> kind<00:04:47.150> of<00:04:47.240> thing

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
truth but there are two kind of thing

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.890 
truth but there are two kind of thing
it's<00:04:47.990> like<00:04:48.290> how<00:04:48.770> to<00:04:48.830> stick<00:04:49.180> if<00:04:50.180> you<00:04:50.240> are

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
it's like how to stick if you are

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.950 
it's like how to stick if you are
listening<00:04:51.290> to<00:04:51.350> Orchestra<00:04:52.070> or<00:04:52.400> a<00:04:53.060> classical

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
listening to Orchestra or a classical

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.120 
listening to Orchestra or a classical
music<00:04:54.440> or<00:04:55.810> soundtrack<00:04:56.810> from<00:04:57.169> the<00:04:57.290> movies<00:04:57.680> I

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
music or soundtrack from the movies I

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.360 
music or soundtrack from the movies I
think<00:04:58.820> I<00:04:58.940> even<00:04:59.389> drew<00:04:59.540> will<00:04:59.720> do<00:04:59.900> a<00:04:59.930> better<00:05:00.229> job

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
think I even drew will do a better job

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.700 
think I even drew will do a better job
but<00:05:01.370> when<00:05:01.910> you<00:05:02.030> are<00:05:02.150> listening<00:05:02.300> to<00:05:02.900> pop<00:05:03.410> song

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
but when you are listening to pop song

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.010 
but when you are listening to pop song
or<00:05:04.010> metal<00:05:04.570> the<00:05:05.570> theater<00:05:06.290> we<00:05:06.470> just<00:05:07.720> it<00:05:08.720> looked

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
or metal the theater we just it looked

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.740 
or metal the theater we just it looked
better<00:05:09.260> because<00:05:09.710> the<00:05:10.580> bass<00:05:10.850> is<00:05:11.150> more<00:05:11.419> clear

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
better because the bass is more clear

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.440 
better because the bass is more clear
and<00:05:12.200> more<00:05:12.560> faster<00:05:13.160> why<00:05:14.000> am<00:05:14.120> I<00:05:14.180> saying<00:05:14.330> is

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
and more faster why am I saying is

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:19.180 
and more faster why am I saying is
faster<00:05:14.930> yeah<00:05:15.850> well<00:05:16.850> the<00:05:17.300> true<00:05:17.600> and<00:05:17.900> the<00:05:18.740> I

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
faster yeah well the true and the I

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.760 
faster yeah well the true and the I
hundred<00:05:19.940> above<00:05:20.270> how<00:05:20.510> to<00:05:20.570> drive<00:05:20.900> I<00:05:21.139> think<00:05:21.470> in<00:05:21.650> my

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
hundred above how to drive I think in my

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:27.310 
hundred above how to drive I think in my
opening<00:05:22.039> I<00:05:23.050> mean<00:05:24.050> drive<00:05:24.320> well<00:05:25.780> but<00:05:26.780> when<00:05:27.020> you

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
opening I mean drive well but when you

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.279 
opening I mean drive well but when you
give<00:05:27.919> them<00:05:28.190> enough<00:05:28.610> amplification<00:05:29.539> they<00:05:30.139> will

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:30.289 
give them enough amplification they will

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:33.370 
give them enough amplification they will
sound<00:05:30.530> very<00:05:30.620> wide<00:05:31.160> it's<00:05:31.550> the<00:05:32.450> sound<00:05:32.750> stage

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
sound very wide it's the sound stage

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.190 
sound very wide it's the sound stage
will<00:05:33.820> how<00:05:34.820> to<00:05:34.880> say<00:05:35.090> the<00:05:35.240> sound<00:05:35.479> stage<00:05:35.720> is<00:05:35.870> big

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
will how to say the sound stage is big

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.909 
will how to say the sound stage is big
like<00:05:36.590> you<00:05:37.340> are<00:05:37.490> listening<00:05:38.030> to<00:05:38.090> open<00:05:38.720> back<00:05:38.990> open

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:39.919 
like you are listening to open back open

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:45.730 
like you are listening to open back open
back<00:05:40.190> big<00:05:40.700> headphone<00:05:41.210> and<00:05:43.539> the<00:05:44.539> truth<00:05:44.870> has<00:05:45.500> a

back big headphone and the truth has a
very<00:05:46.160> very<00:05:47.090> good<00:05:47.389> layering<00:05:48.080> of<00:05:48.289> the<00:05:48.320> sound<00:05:48.800> and

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
very very good layering of the sound and

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:54.190 
very very good layering of the sound and
the<00:05:50.169> sound<00:05:51.169> stage<00:05:51.590> of<00:05:51.950> the<00:05:52.849> truth<00:05:53.150> it's<00:05:53.479> a<00:05:53.750> bit

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:54.200 
the sound stage of the truth it's a bit

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
the sound stage of the truth it's a bit
deeper<00:05:55.130> than<00:05:55.849> the<00:05:56.150> I<00:05:56.180> hundred<00:05:56.900> but<00:05:57.590> not<00:05:57.950> as

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
deeper than the I hundred but not as

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:04.029 
deeper than the I hundred but not as
open<00:05:58.789> as<00:05:59.090> the<00:05:59.539> 800<00:06:00.380> 800<00:06:01.310> still<00:06:01.520> hits<00:06:01.789> a<00:06:03.039> wider

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:04.039 
open as the 800 800 still hits a wider

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:07.600 
open as the 800 800 still hits a wider
soundstage<00:06:04.810> not<00:06:05.810> very<00:06:06.050> not<00:06:06.710> very<00:06:06.740> much<00:06:07.310> but

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
soundstage not very not very much but

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:14.500 
soundstage not very not very much but
just<00:06:07.639> a<00:06:08.060> little<00:06:08.180> bit<00:06:08.360> wider<00:06:08.630> and<00:06:11.500> I'd<00:06:12.500> say<00:06:13.510> okay

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:14.510 
just a little bit wider and I'd say okay

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.529 
just a little bit wider and I'd say okay
for<00:06:14.720> the<00:06:14.810> vocals<00:06:15.430> for<00:06:16.430> the<00:06:16.520> vocals<00:06:17.090> on<00:06:17.330> the

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:17.539 
for the vocals for the vocals on the

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:22.260 
for the vocals for the vocals on the
truth<00:06:17.950> pants<00:06:18.950> and<00:06:19.190> I<00:06:19.880> would<00:06:20.690> say<00:06:20.840> an<00:06:20.960> extremely

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270 
truth pants and I would say an extremely

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.210 
truth pants and I would say an extremely
natural<00:06:23.270> presentation<00:06:23.630> of<00:06:24.200> the<00:06:24.349> vocals<00:06:24.800> it's

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.220 
natural presentation of the vocals it's

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.700 
natural presentation of the vocals it's
like<00:06:25.520> there's<00:06:25.789> zero<00:06:26.419> coloration<00:06:27.260> on<00:06:27.410> the<00:06:27.500> meat

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710 
like there's zero coloration on the meat

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.909 
like there's zero coloration on the meat
it's<00:06:28.550> just<00:06:29.060> so<00:06:29.270> natural<00:06:29.570> like<00:06:30.050> you're<00:06:30.469> you're

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:30.919 
it's just so natural like you're you're

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:33.640 
it's just so natural like you're you're
listening<00:06:31.370> to<00:06:31.580> the<00:06:31.870> original<00:06:32.870> recording

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:33.650 
listening to the original recording

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:40.360 
listening to the original recording
oh<00:06:33.680> wow<00:06:34.900> yeah<00:06:35.930> and<00:06:38.020> well<00:06:39.020> and<00:06:39.260> the<00:06:39.560> position<00:06:40.160> of

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:40.370 
oh wow yeah and well and the position of

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.600 
oh wow yeah and well and the position of
the<00:06:40.610> local<00:06:41.060> is<00:06:41.270> a<00:06:41.750> bit<00:06:42.620> closer<00:06:42.949> to<00:06:43.370> you

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.610 
the local is a bit closer to you

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:51.129 
the local is a bit closer to you
compared<00:06:44.600> to<00:06:44.720> the<00:06:44.840> 800<00:06:45.590> and<00:06:45.800> uh<00:06:48.580> yeah<00:06:49.580> and<00:06:50.139> what

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:51.139 
compared to the 800 and uh yeah and what

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:55.990 
compared to the 800 and uh yeah and what
I<00:06:51.169> want<00:06:51.410> to<00:06:51.470> say<00:06:51.620> a<00:06:51.650> loss<00:06:51.979> is<00:06:52.280> that<00:06:52.639> the<00:06:55.000> the

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 
I want to say a loss is that the the

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.460 
I want to say a loss is that the the
truth<00:06:56.479> it's<00:06:56.870> a<00:06:58.000> bit<00:06:59.000> more<00:06:59.270> code<00:06:59.720> sounding

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:00.470 
truth it's a bit more code sounding

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.840 
truth it's a bit more code sounding
compared<00:07:01.130> to<00:07:01.250> the<00:07:01.370> 800<00:07:02.060> I<00:07:02.240> have<00:07:02.870> 800<00:07:03.199> it's<00:07:03.919> it

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:04.850 
compared to the 800 I have 800 it's it

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.920 
compared to the 800 I have 800 it's it
sounds<00:07:05.540> very<00:07:05.690> natural<00:07:05.960> and<00:07:06.530> a<00:07:07.010> bit<00:07:07.190> warm<00:07:07.520> but

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:07.930 
sounds very natural and a bit warm but

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.710 
sounds very natural and a bit warm but
the<00:07:08.930> truth<00:07:09.199> is<00:07:09.410> also<00:07:10.340> very<00:07:10.580> natural<00:07:11.030> but<00:07:11.270> tends

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:11.720 
the truth is also very natural but tends

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.700 
the truth is also very natural but tends
to<00:07:11.960> code<00:07:12.260> I<00:07:12.560> think<00:07:12.620> and<00:07:14.050> in<00:07:15.050> my<00:07:15.229> opinion

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:15.710 
to code I think and in my opinion

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:19.330 
to code I think and in my opinion
they're<00:07:16.150> they're<00:07:17.150> just<00:07:17.180> too<00:07:17.750> extreme<00:07:18.260> of<00:07:18.620> the

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:19.340 
they're they're just too extreme of the

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.840 
they're they're just too extreme of the
dynamic<00:07:20.060> driver<00:07:20.419> in<00:07:20.810> your<00:07:20.990> monitor<00:07:21.139> and<00:07:21.850> I

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:22.850 
dynamic driver in your monitor and I

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:27.240 
dynamic driver in your monitor and I
like<00:07:23.389> both<00:07:23.960> of<00:07:23.990> them<00:07:24.940> so<00:07:25.940> I<00:07:25.970> think<00:07:26.120> it<00:07:26.360> does<00:07:26.510> it

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:27.250 
like both of them so I think it does it

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:30.520 
like both of them so I think it does it
