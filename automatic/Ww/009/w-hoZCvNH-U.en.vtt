00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:12.960
 on this video i will create a boot 9 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:16.930
 mother operating system disk online 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:20.349
 for laptops because I have a lot 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:23.470
 a message comes and people ask 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:26.040
 exactly drive for laptops this drive 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:29.980
 will be for laptops on the intel processor 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:32.380
 core i3 core i5 core i7 core 2 duo 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.410
 in general if you have a laptop on 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:39.460
 process intel and you want to put 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:41.850
 poppy itself then this disk will suit you in what 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.310
 its difference from simple disks which 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.050
 there is the fact for simple computers 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.880
 that when will it be created 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.360
 laptop boot disk 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.260
 there will be added additional 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.840
 cupcakes or 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.350
 to more clearly additional 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:02.980
 driver so that you have a coat of arms connectors 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.500
 worked so that 3 by one worked 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.420
 word cupcakes or drivers they are a little bit 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.509
 others are not like ordinary 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.210
 computers and chipset naturally 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.979
 works a little differently therefore 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.759
 extra cupcakes needed 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:21.039
 mount in this boot disk 9 but 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.109
 and then sit in your siddik drive 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:23.889
 put your laptop and you can 

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:27.219
 set 

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:28.929
 I will make a bootable 9 disk with 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:32.170
 mountain ovine operating system 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:34.209
 the last 10 85 I will not do 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.999
 boot disk from the operating system 

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:39.759
 Mavrik only because he evrik us 

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:42.459
 as for laptops, there are very few 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:45.850
 cupcakes you then can not find yourself 

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:47.709
 cupcakes that the video card worked for you 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.990
 You can not find a hex, and that you 

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:52.749
 bluetooth bluetooth is the most important camera 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.850
 I worked why you can not because 

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:55.679
 just they have not yet come up with local 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.749
 hackers 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:00.819
 there must be some time for 

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:03.939
 mountain line you can easily find 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:04.869
 on the internet I think there is no problem 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.080
 will arise 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.119
 and so here is my mother online 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.920
 I open my license disk 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:16.380
 mountain war is not an assembly 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.380
 I bought it in the appstore and 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:22.750
 I want to say that this is also a disk 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:25.750
 It is created only on a Mac on a virtual machine. 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.459
 Unfortunately you can not create it but 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.650
 in fact, this program creates 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.659
 the whole drive itself I actually it in to on 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.209
 push buttons 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:37.329
 but this is a good thing for those who do not 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.220
 moq and who does not have this program 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:42.970
 just doesn't want tenge to freeze and 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:48.189
 create himself wants to download ready 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:49.900
 image and so earlier I pressed the top 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:52.980
 part now i will press this one 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.840
 lower part especially for a laptops 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.629
 when i click install on my 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.079
 20 minutes will pass on the screen and iso will appear 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:06.189
 image of this image I will try to fill in 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:09.939
 Yandex drive here and then you can 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:13.239
 download burn double-layer disc 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:15.849
 through the mayor and install on your 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.739
 laptop here as soon as I flood it on 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:20.319
 Yandex drive I'm on my page in 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:23.530
 Internet, here I will add a new menu 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:26.889
 it will be written here mac os 10 85 for 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.260
 laptops here everyone can 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:31.540
 write no later message in the contract 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.690
 but pre-read my status on 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.209
 my page in contact and so 9 disk 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.579
 created naturally i'm his business without 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.379
 capturing video by turning off all sorts of 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:44.500
 programs to eliminate the slightest 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:48.220
 I have a mistake here on my desktop 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.199
 This iso-image So I opened it for 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.829
 to show what is different from us 

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:57.840
 a simple 9 disk we go to the folder 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:04:00.849
 extra and here is special sm bios 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.900
 the fact is that this symbiosis is special 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:08.049
 designed for laptops 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.189
 Here for laptops here it is indicated that this 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.780
 macbook pro 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:13.060
 that is, when we will install 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.989
 system our system will understand that we 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.470
 install 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:20.820
 mapquest on macbook pro macbook pro 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.820
 version 83 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:27.069
 and here special cupcakes are added here 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.729
 what I was talking about is a special injector 

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:32.560
 to 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:37.120
 Wi fi supported trackpad 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:41.169
 worked us to sata connector on 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:44.830
 laptop decided to beat her 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:47.740
 worked but this is the most important cupcake sex 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.719
 in sims for the magician to be launched by one 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.909
 special cupcakes are added here 

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:54.699
 for laptop 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:56.460
 this is the difference between this disc 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:58.840
 from a simple disk 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.719
 what is left for me now to write it down 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:04.000
 Most on a pig and try of course on 

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:05.710
 simple computer run at 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.080
 least I will not install because 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.449
 i don't want to erase my system but 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.389
 at least run walk to 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:15.370
 installation moment to show what it is 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:18.060
 It works in principle, you can now 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.060
 will make 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:26.300
 here on this computers are not on the laptop we 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:29.479
 check how this 9 up disk works 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.629
 the mountain line 10 85 try it 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:31.629
 run 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:48.440
 choose boot from dvd-disk f10 and 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.440
 forward 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:58.660
 press space and enter the command 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:22.770
 the installation will continue here 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:27.599
 multiple screens like a black background 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:29.669
 there will be a lot of credits so I do not know 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:31.530
 I guess I won't need to write all this 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:34.439
 will wait for the fire itself 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:36.689
 installation time because that's what 

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:38.819
 you now see it will be given that 

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:39.479
 what i wrote at slow speed on 

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:41.939
 pig 

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:45.090
 it will be extra five to ten minutes this 

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:53.849
 There is no point in writing 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:56.449
 pause after about 5-6 minutes 

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:59.460
 a black screen also appeared with text 

00:06:56.449 --> 00:07:02.969
 such screens will also be about six seven 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:04.979
 and then the installation will light up therefore 

00:07:02.969 --> 00:07:07.469
 too, while we will not wait gradually 

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:09.029
 text like this will be replaced 

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:11.870
 wait for the fire itself 

00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:11.870
 install mac os 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:21.840
 Well, actually we put everything further 

00:07:19.289 --> 00:07:24.900
 exactly the same i have on the channel like 

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:26.699
 put a maverick on this computer I could 

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:30.539
 I will not bet because I used 

00:07:26.699 --> 00:07:33.030
 Its only for Windows but the meaning is exactly 

00:07:30.539 --> 00:07:36.389
 the same goal was to show that even 

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:38.909
 me though but not a laptop but this drive 

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:43.610
 I have a core processor running here 

00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:43.610
 i5 here gts450 graphics card
