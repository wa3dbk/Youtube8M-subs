we in the back compared to where the
fans<00:02:20.110> are<00:02:20.440> that<00:02:20.890> it<00:02:21.010> there<00:02:21.670> would<00:02:21.820> be<00:02:21.850> it<00:02:22.180> go

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
towards the center ok fine

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.730 
towards the center ok fine
just<00:02:36.610> that<00:02:37.420> and<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.750> figures<00:02:38.110> not<00:02:38.320> that<00:02:38.530> great

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
just that and the figures not that great

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.730 
just that and the figures not that great
I<00:02:38.800> mean<00:02:38.920> it's<00:02:39.190> really<00:02:39.430> floppy<00:02:39.880> and<00:02:40.740> his

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740

I mean it's really floppy and his
transformation<00:02:42.160> is<00:02:42.910> just<00:02:43.950> hit<00:02:44.950> do<00:02:45.490> that<00:02:45.720> that

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
transformation is just hit do that that

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.450 
transformation is just hit do that that
gets<00:02:46.960> you<00:02:47.140> his<00:02:47.290> head<00:02:48.150> fold<00:02:49.150> out<00:02:49.300> the<00:02:49.450> legs<00:02:50.460> like

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
gets you his head fold out the legs like

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
gets you his head fold out the legs like
that<00:02:52.380> rotate<00:02:53.380> this<00:02:53.500> up<00:02:53.770> and<00:02:54.010> you<00:02:54.250> get<00:02:54.480> the

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
that rotate this up and you get the

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.070 
that rotate this up and you get the
worst<00:02:55.870> little<00:02:56.560> arms<00:02:57.190> on<00:02:57.460> a<00:02:57.520> robot<00:02:58.360> I<00:02:58.570> have<00:02:58.720> ever

ahead<00:03:42.850> and<00:03:42.940> get<00:03:43.030> emerged<00:03:43.390> up<00:03:45.240> to<00:03:46.240> start<00:03:47.080> the

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
ahead and get emerged up to start the

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.540 
ahead and get emerged up to start the
merge<00:03:47.440> sequence<00:03:47.950> we're<00:03:48.130> going<00:03:48.250> to<00:03:48.310> just

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
merge sequence we're going to just

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.070 
merge sequence we're going to just
rotate<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:49.750> legs<00:03:49.959> back<00:03:50.680> to<00:03:51.190> that<00:03:51.370> and<00:03:52.080> then

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
pop off the blades so we'll take two of

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.710 
pop off the blades so we'll take two of
them<00:04:11.520> take<00:04:12.520> the<00:04:12.670> blades<00:04:12.910> off<00:04:14.459> for<00:04:15.459> two<00:04:16.390> of<00:04:16.570> them

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
them take the blades off for two of them

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.970 
them take the blades off for two of them
we'll<00:04:17.049> just<00:04:17.820> turn<00:04:18.820> them<00:04:18.970> like<00:04:19.120> that<00:04:19.830> point<00:04:20.830> the

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
we'll just turn them like that point the

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.760 
we'll just turn them like that point the
feet<00:04:21.130> point<00:04:21.640> the<00:04:22.320> arms<00:04:23.320> forward

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
feet point the arms forward

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:31.180 
feet point the arms forward
and<00:04:25.770> point<00:04:26.700> the<00:04:26.790> arms<00:04:27.000> forward<00:04:29.180> okay<00:04:30.180> be

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
and point the arms forward okay be

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:41.510 
and point the arms forward okay be
attached<00:04:39.470> extend<00:04:40.470> that<00:04:40.650> like<00:04:41.250> you<00:04:41.370> would

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
attached extend that like you would

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.860 
attached extend that like you would
rotate<00:04:42.450> that<00:04:42.810> forward<00:04:43.290> and<00:04:43.610> then<00:04:44.690> turn<00:04:45.690> it

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
rotate that forward and then turn it

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.680 
rotate that forward and then turn it
thusly<00:04:46.760> actually<00:04:47.760> just<00:04:47.970> get<00:04:48.120> the<00:04:48.210> arms<00:04:48.480> out<00:04:48.630> of
