the machine that either has a dead drive
or<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:34.950> damaged<00:01:35.369> drive<00:01:35.610> if<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:35.880> want<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.090> get

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
or a damaged drive if you want to get

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.880 
or a damaged drive if you want to get
the<00:01:36.270> data<00:01:36.450> off<00:01:36.509> this<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.530> how<00:01:37.590> you're<00:01:37.710> going<00:01:37.799> to

the data off this is how you're going to
go<00:01:38.009> about<00:01:38.189> doing<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:38.850> in<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:39.329> case<00:01:39.540> it's

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
go about doing it so in this case it's

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.730 
go about doing it so in this case it's
going<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.020> do<00:01:40.079> this<00:01:40.229> little<00:01:40.439> thing<00:01:40.590> right<00:01:40.650> here

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
going to do this little thing right here

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
progress bar right around here but it's

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.069 
progress bar right around here but it's
just<00:01:48.240> going<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.420> stay<00:01:48.600> there<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:48.869> it's<00:01:48.990> going

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
just going to stay there and it's going

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.899 
just going to stay there and it's going
to<00:01:49.170> reboot<00:01:49.619> itself<00:01:50.130> it's<00:01:50.369> just<00:01:50.399> keep<00:01:50.790> on

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
to reboot itself it's just keep on

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.539 
to reboot itself it's just keep on
rebooting<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.420> doesn't<00:01:51.600> get<00:01:51.689> past<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.140> so

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
rebooting and doesn't get past that so

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.490 
rebooting and doesn't get past that so
in<00:01:53.549> this<00:01:53.729> case<00:01:54.000> some<00:01:54.299> tool<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:54.990> comes<00:01:55.170> very

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
in this case some tool that comes very

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.600 
in this case some tool that comes very
very<00:01:55.740> handy<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.100> don't<00:01:56.219> have<00:01:56.310> this<00:01:56.430> disc

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
very handy I don't have this disc

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.359 
very handy I don't have this disc
labeled<00:01:57.030> but<00:01:57.540> this<00:01:57.630> might<00:01:57.840> ubuntu<00:01:58.469> CD<00:01:59.219> right

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
labeled but this might ubuntu CD right

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.410 
labeled but this might ubuntu CD right
here<00:01:59.399> this<00:01:59.640> is<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.759> latest<00:02:00.060> version<00:02:00.329> of

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
Ubuntu and this can come in huge amounts

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.670 
Ubuntu and this can come in huge amounts
of<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.689> know<00:02:03.810> for<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.020> lot<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.259> repairs<00:02:04.560> I've

of you know for a lot of repairs I've
done<00:02:04.829> so<00:02:04.950> far<00:02:05.159> Ubuntu<00:02:05.610> has<00:02:05.700> been<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.820> huge

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
done so far Ubuntu has been a huge

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.510 
done so far Ubuntu has been a huge
lifesaver<00:02:07.020> so<00:02:07.409> what<00:02:07.619> this<00:02:07.770> can<00:02:07.920> do<00:02:08.039> is<00:02:08.069> I'm

lifesaver so what this can do is I'm

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.800 
lifesaver so what this can do is I'm
going<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.759> go<00:02:08.819> ahead<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.060> boot<00:02:09.179> into<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.599> disc

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
going to go ahead and boot into the disc

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.869 
going to go ahead and boot into the disc
when<00:02:09.989> I<00:02:10.020> turn<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.319> iMac<00:02:10.560> off<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:11.340> what<00:02:11.760> this

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
when I turn the iMac off and what this

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.130 
when I turn the iMac off and what this
allows<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.270> do<00:02:12.360> this<00:02:12.510> allows<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.900> boot

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
allows you to do this allows you to boot

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.460 
allows you to do this allows you to boot
into

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
into

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.930 
into
good<00:02:13.620> -<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.100> you<00:02:14.520> can<00:02:14.610> do<00:02:14.700> this<00:02:14.790> with<00:02:14.880> a

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
good - and you can do this with a

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.970 
good - and you can do this with a
Windows<00:02:15.180> machine<00:02:15.300> or<00:02:15.630> Mac<00:02:15.870> I<00:02:16.410> just<00:02:16.650> wanna<00:02:16.920> make

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
Windows machine or Mac I just wanna make

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.290 
Windows machine or Mac I just wanna make

or<00:02:18.540> AMD<00:02:18.570> so<00:02:19.500> in<00:02:19.590> this<00:02:19.650> case<00:02:19.890> I'm<00:02:20.160> just<00:02:20.190> going<00:02:20.400> to

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
or AMD so in this case I'm just going to

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.420 
or AMD so in this case I'm just going to
be<00:02:20.550> inserting<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.450> CD<00:02:21.600> in<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.900> side<00:02:22.140> here<00:02:22.430> I'm

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
be inserting the CD in the side here I'm

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.220 
be inserting the CD in the side here I'm
going<00:02:23.550> to<00:02:23.610> hold<00:02:23.760> down<00:02:23.880> C<00:02:24.300> which<00:02:24.660> means<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:25.050> boot

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
going to hold down C which means to boot

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.320 
going to hold down C which means to boot
from<00:02:25.260> disk<00:02:25.650> on<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:25.980> Mac<00:02:26.160> so<00:02:27.090> I'm<00:02:27.180> going<00:02:27.300> to

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:44.140 
have to go into users and then whoops

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.570 
have to go into users and then whoops
actually<00:05:44.740> clipping<00:05:45.040> on<00:05:45.130> right<00:05:45.250> there
