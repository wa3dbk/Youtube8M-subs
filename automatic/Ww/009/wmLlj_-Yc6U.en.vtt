00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.820 
another minecraft tutorial what we're
going<00:00:13.090> to<00:00:13.180> be<00:00:13.270> making<00:00:13.420> today<00:00:13.810> is<00:00:14.170> a<00:00:14.230> three<00:00:14.680> by

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:14.830 
going to be making today is a three by

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.100 
going to be making today is a three by
three<00:00:14.860> piston<00:00:15.490> door<00:00:15.640> but<00:00:16.570> this<00:00:16.750> isn't<00:00:17.050> the

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.110 
three piston door but this isn't the

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.859 
three piston door but this isn't the
usual<00:00:17.320> door<00:00:17.770> that<00:00:18.039> we<00:00:18.160> make<00:00:18.370> it's<00:00:19.180> a<00:00:19.360> spiral

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:19.869 
usual door that we make it's a spiral

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:21.300 
usual door that we make it's a spiral
through<00:00:20.080> by<00:00:20.170> three<00:00:20.380> piston<00:00:20.710> door<00:00:20.860> so<00:00:21.160> this<00:00:21.250> is

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.310 
through by three piston door so this is

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:22.710 
through by three piston door so this is
how<00:00:21.400> it<00:00:21.580> works<00:00:21.700> when<00:00:22.119> you<00:00:22.180> want<00:00:22.360> to<00:00:22.420> open<00:00:22.630> it

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
how it works when you want to open it

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.680 
how it works when you want to open it
click<00:00:23.140> the<00:00:23.260> lever<00:00:23.440> and<00:00:23.880> as<00:00:24.880> you<00:00:25.030> can<00:00:25.180> see<00:00:25.210> the

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:25.690 
click the lever and as you can see the

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.960 
click the lever and as you can see the
door<00:00:25.900> opens<00:00:26.350> in<00:00:26.560> a<00:00:26.650> spiral<00:00:26.949> when<00:00:27.670> you<00:00:27.760> want<00:00:27.910> to

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
door opens in a spiral when you want to

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.849 
door opens in a spiral when you want to
close<00:00:28.150> the<00:00:28.300> door<00:00:28.449> hit<00:00:28.720> the<00:00:28.840> lover<00:00:28.990> again<00:00:29.230> and

close the door hit the lover again and

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:32.159 
close the door hit the lover again and
it'll<00:00:30.400> still<00:00:30.699> close<00:00:30.970> in<00:00:31.180> the<00:00:31.270> spiral<00:00:31.510> so<00:00:31.960> let

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
it'll still close in the spiral so let

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.200 
it'll still close in the spiral so let
us<00:00:32.199> look<00:00:32.439> at<00:00:32.560> the<00:00:32.680> red<00:00:32.860> stone<00:00:33.130> so<00:00:33.760> here's<00:00:34.030> the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
us look at the red stone so here's the

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.479 
us look at the red stone so here's the
red<00:00:34.360> stone<00:00:34.630> as<00:00:34.870> you<00:00:35.320> can<00:00:35.440> see<00:00:35.649> this<00:00:35.860> is<00:00:36.100> a<00:00:36.130> small

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489 
red stone as you can see this is a small

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:38.790 
red stone as you can see this is a small
and<00:00:36.670> compact<00:00:36.790> design<00:00:37.180> it's<00:00:38.020> not<00:00:38.260> as<00:00:38.380> small<00:00:38.620> as

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
and compact design it's not as small as

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.590 
and compact design it's not as small as
my<00:00:38.980> other<00:00:39.160> design<00:00:39.610> but<00:00:40.149> that's<00:00:40.300> only<00:00:40.450> because

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
my other design but that's only because

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.840 
my other design but that's only because
this<00:00:41.260> opens<00:00:41.710> in<00:00:41.860> the<00:00:41.920> spiral<00:00:42.190> and<00:00:42.610> the<00:00:42.730> other

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
this opens in the spiral and the other

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.060 
this opens in the spiral and the other
one<00:00:43.090> is<00:00:43.120> ramen<00:00:43.630> so<00:00:44.260> let<00:00:44.530> us<00:00:44.559> start<00:00:44.800> the

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
one is ramen so let us start the

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.340 
one is ramen so let us start the
