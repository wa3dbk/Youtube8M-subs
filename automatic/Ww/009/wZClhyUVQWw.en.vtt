00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:11.649
 then maximum 

00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:14.289
 bennato electric city 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:17.659
 xxnx 

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:21.079
 I sharpen what I did 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:25.409
 a further improvement we have removed only original battery packs at 

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:28.409
 nickel case 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:31.539
 about 200 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:33.870
 rear for approx 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.100
 180 degrees 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.390
 We have eliminated all hot nickel batteries to down no single package 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.730
 big lithium polymer batteries 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.140
 for these reasons it was you 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.030
 dump hey my my ip 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.020
 apply paper 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.280
 in order to obtain certainty that these batteries if you believe 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.950
 all there is to say the machine earned you normally performance 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.020
 seen 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.220
 if about 300 kilos of battery have been created 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.750
 Go to the autonomy of this machine with these batteries of around 100 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.180
 kilometres 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.720
 without saving anything with eagle no more 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.100
 I would say that it is a very pleasant machine years 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.650
 a recovery 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.330
 I would say quite satisfactory indeed 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.520
 course over many machines 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.520
 the gasoline there is 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.460
 rivets and coconut 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.750
 1 batteries would say 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.620
 last generation 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.780
 the best is currently on the market 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.509
 are not very high specification flamed nail batteries and I would say 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.550
 here is that of lead 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.290
 and therefore also the weights on board of the car are completely 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:04.850
 insignificant 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.969
 the same weight as a petrol tank can be considered 

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:11.989
 the machine has a weight 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.599
 in running order comparable to that of a normal spot 

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:20.230
 I would say that for the future there should be no more 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.009
 problems 

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:24.369
 those electric cars of use
