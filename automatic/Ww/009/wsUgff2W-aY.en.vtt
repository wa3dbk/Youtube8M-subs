SFI<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:10.050> reason<00:00:10.320> we're<00:00:10.440> doing<00:00:10.469> it<00:00:10.740> is<00:00:10.860> because

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
SFI the reason we're doing it is because

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.270 
SFI the reason we're doing it is because
we<00:00:11.309> still<00:00:11.519> have<00:00:11.700> a<00:00:11.730> miss<00:00:12.530> there's<00:00:13.530> a<00:00:13.620> miss<00:00:14.040> in

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
we still have a miss there's a miss in

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.460 
we still have a miss there's a miss in
the<00:00:14.759> ignition<00:00:15.360> system<00:00:15.540> somewhere<00:00:15.990> I've

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
the ignition system somewhere I've

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.820 
the ignition system somewhere I've
already<00:00:16.800> replaced<00:00:17.070> all<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.520> plug<00:00:17.880> wires<00:00:18.119> and

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
already replaced all the plug wires and

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.689 
already replaced all the plug wires and
repaired<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.980> plug<00:00:20.160> wires<00:00:20.310> that<00:00:20.580> were

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
repaired the plug wires that were

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.779 
repaired the plug wires that were
damaged<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:22.130> we<00:00:23.130> still<00:00:23.369> have<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.519> miss<00:00:23.760> and

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
damaged and we still have a miss and

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.519 
damaged and we still have a miss and
this<00:00:24.060> was<00:00:24.240> after<00:00:24.480> doing<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:25.080> spark<00:00:25.470> plug

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
this was after doing a spark plug

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.980 
this was after doing a spark plug
tune-up<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.369> air<00:00:27.180> filter<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.720> all<00:00:27.810> that

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
tune-up and air filter and all that

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.099 
tune-up and air filter and all that
stuff<00:00:28.260> also<00:00:29.210> so<00:00:30.210> what<00:00:30.390> we<00:00:30.510> did<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.840> we<00:00:31.019> went

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
stuff also so what we did is we went

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.889 
stuff also so what we did is we went
ahead<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.500> purchased<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:32.189> coil<00:00:33.000> pack<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.750> this

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
ahead and purchased a coil pack and this

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.180 
ahead and purchased a coil pack and this
is<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.140> coil<00:00:34.380> pack<00:00:34.910> there's<00:00:37.190> three

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
is the coil pack there's three

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.840 
is the coil pack there's three
individual<00:00:38.850> units<00:00:39.239> on<00:00:39.390> this<00:00:39.629> one<00:00:39.960> pack<00:00:40.290> here

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
individual units on this one pack here

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.950 
individual units on this one pack here
we<00:00:41.850> went<00:00:42.030> ahead<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.239> picked<00:00:42.510> this<00:00:42.629> up<00:00:42.780> from

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
we went ahead and picked this up from

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.869 
we went ahead and picked this up from
the<00:00:43.489> wrecking<00:00:44.489> yard<00:00:45.530> this<00:00:46.530> one's<00:00:46.770> off<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.219> 94

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
the wrecking yard this one's off of a 94

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:59.319 
the wrecking yard this one's off of a 94
rodeo<00:00:51.260> and<00:00:52.260> it's<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.590> v6<00:00:52.739> 3.4<00:00:53.610> liter<00:00:53.820> v6<00:00:54.210> also

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.910 

the<00:01:00.329> reason<00:01:00.629> we<00:01:00.750> got<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.050> Isuzu<00:01:01.410> one<00:01:01.770> is

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
the reason we got the Isuzu one is

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.520 
the reason we got the Isuzu one is
because<00:01:02.250> they're<00:01:02.730> interchangeable

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
because they're interchangeable

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.200 
because they're interchangeable
this<00:01:04.530> one<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.920> interchangeable<00:01:05.519> with<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.880> v6

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
this one is interchangeable with the v6

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.990 
this one is interchangeable with the v6
on<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:06.840> engine<00:01:07.080> as<00:01:07.380> well<00:01:08.100> as<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.369> v6<00:01:08.760> on<00:01:08.970> a

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
on this engine as well as the v6 on a

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.530 
on this engine as well as the v6 on a
Grand<00:01:09.299> Am<00:01:10.189> so<00:01:11.540> the<00:01:12.540> coil<00:01:12.780> packed<00:01:13.080> on<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.350> car

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:24.440 

is<00:01:18.540> right<00:01:18.840> here

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.070 

there's<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.350> three<00:01:25.590> individual<00:01:26.100> units<00:01:27.080> with

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
there's the three individual units with

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.770 
there's the three individual units with
all<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.380> plug<00:01:28.619> wires<00:01:28.770> going<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:30.600> only

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
all the plug wires going to it the only

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.210 
all the plug wires going to it the only
thing<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:31.020> noticed<00:01:31.320> different<00:01:31.680> is<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.979> mount

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
thing I noticed different is the mount

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.870 
thing I noticed different is the mount
where<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.939> mounts<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:34.460> power<00:01:35.460> steering

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
where it mounts to the power steering

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.960 
where it mounts to the power steering
bracket<00:01:36.799> so<00:01:37.799> what<00:01:37.979> we<00:01:38.070> have<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.310> do<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.610> we<00:01:38.729> move

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
bracket so what we have to do is we move

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.170 
bracket so what we have to do is we move
the<00:01:39.180> plug<00:01:39.390> wires<00:01:39.630> from<00:01:39.899> this<00:01:40.110> one<00:01:40.290> here<00:01:41.180> remove

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
the plug wires from this one here remove

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.230 
the plug wires from this one here remove
that<00:01:42.390> coil<00:01:42.720> pack<00:01:43.789> install<00:01:44.789> it<00:01:44.940> on<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.210> new

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
that coil pack install it on the new

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.910 
that coil pack install it on the new
mount<00:01:45.600> which<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.200> mount<00:01:46.409> we're<00:01:46.530> gonna<00:01:46.680> use

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
mount which is the mount we're gonna use

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.560 
mount which is the mount we're gonna use
this<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.549> mount<00:01:47.759> we're<00:01:47.850> going<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.060> use<00:01:48.270> and

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
this is the mount we're going to use and

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.320 
this is the mount we're going to use and
then<00:01:49.470> plug<00:01:50.070> all<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.310> plug<00:01:50.520> wires<00:01:50.700> back<00:01:50.939> in<00:01:51.180> and

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
then plug all the plug wires back in and

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.279 
then plug all the plug wires back in and
hopefully<00:01:51.600> they'll<00:01:51.780> take<00:01:52.020> care<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.229> the

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
hopefully they'll take care of the

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:54.380 
hopefully they'll take care of the
problem<00:01:52.789> I'm<00:01:53.789> gonna<00:01:53.909> go<00:01:54.060> ahead<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.240> get

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
problem I'm gonna go ahead and get

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.840 
problem I'm gonna go ahead and get
started<00:01:54.509> on<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.740> once<00:01:56.220> I<00:01:56.340> get<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.520> little<00:01:56.729> bit

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
started on it so once I get a little bit

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.820 
started on it so once I get a little bit
further<00:01:57.090> into<00:01:57.300> it<00:01:57.420> I'll<00:01:57.630> give<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.960> update

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
further into it I'll give you a update

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.330 
further into it I'll give you a update
and<00:01:59.729> so<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.060> can<00:02:00.240> see<00:02:00.740> actually<00:02:01.740> what's<00:02:02.159> going

condition<00:02:17.910> but<00:02:18.650> one<00:02:19.650> of<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.799> things<00:02:20.010> we're

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
condition but one of the things we're

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.000 
condition but one of the things we're
going<00:02:20.250> to<00:02:20.280> do<00:02:20.430> first<00:02:20.670> is<00:02:21.410> clean<00:02:22.410> off<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.739> leads

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
going to do first is clean off the leads

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.890 
going to do first is clean off the leads
where<00:02:23.519> the<00:02:23.610> plug<00:02:23.819> wires<00:02:23.970> go<00:02:24.269> these<00:02:24.480> right<00:02:24.660> here

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
where the plug wires go these right here

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.660 
where the plug wires go these right here
and<00:02:25.260> how<00:02:25.799> you<00:02:25.860> do<00:02:26.040> that<00:02:26.390> you<00:02:27.390> take<00:02:27.600> a<00:02:27.660> piece<00:02:27.959> of

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
and how you do that you take a piece of

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.099 
and how you do that you take a piece of
scotch<00:02:29.670> brite<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.470> just<00:02:31.470> turn<00:02:31.739> it<00:02:32.900> pinch<00:02:33.900> it

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:34.109 
scotch brite and just turn it pinch it

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:40.400 
scotch brite and just turn it pinch it
and<00:02:34.200> turn<00:02:34.440> it<00:02:38.329> the<00:02:39.329> data<00:02:39.510> comes<00:02:39.780> out<00:02:39.930> nice<00:02:40.170> and

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
and turn it the data comes out nice and

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.840 
and turn it the data comes out nice and
shiny<00:02:40.620> and<00:02:40.920> brand<00:02:41.130> new<00:02:41.310> looking<00:02:43.700> so<00:02:44.700> we're

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
shiny and brand new looking so we're

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:45.920 
shiny and brand new looking so we're
going<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:45.000> go<00:02:45.120> ahead<00:02:45.269> and<00:02:45.359> do<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.510> rest<00:02:45.540> of

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
going to go ahead and do the rest of

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.000 
going to go ahead and do the rest of
them<00:02:46.049> and<00:02:47.600> then<00:02:48.600> we'll<00:02:48.750> be<00:02:48.840> ready<00:02:49.440> to<00:02:49.739> swap

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
them and then we'll be ready to swap

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:56.150 
them and then we'll be ready to swap
this<00:02:50.160> out<00:02:50.340> with<00:02:50.549> the<00:02:50.670> old<00:02:50.850> one<00:02:54.680> okay<00:02:55.680> we've<00:02:55.890> got

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
this out with the old one okay we've got

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.800 
this out with the old one okay we've got
this<00:02:56.340> one<00:02:56.549> together<00:02:56.700> this<00:02:57.150> is<00:02:57.329> the<00:02:57.480> one<00:02:57.600> that's

this one together this is the one that's

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.750 
this one together this is the one that's
going<00:02:57.989> on<00:02:58.109> the<00:02:58.230> car<00:02:58.410> now<00:02:58.790> this<00:02:59.790> is<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.150> old

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
this is the one off of the rodeo that I

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.680 
this is the one off of the rodeo that I
removed<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.160> coil<00:03:08.400> packs<00:03:08.640> from<00:03:08.940> -<00:03:09.209> installed

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
removed the coil packs from - installed

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.319 
removed the coil packs from - installed
on<00:03:09.810> this<00:03:09.959> this<00:03:10.680> mount<00:03:10.980> here<00:03:11.600> this<00:03:12.600> one<00:03:12.780> here

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
on this this mount here this one here

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.559 
on this this mount here this one here
there's<00:03:15.329> all<00:03:15.420> kinds<00:03:15.720> of<00:03:15.780> dirt<00:03:16.019> right<00:03:16.230> here<00:03:16.530> and

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 
there's all kinds of dirt right here and

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.800 
there's all kinds of dirt right here and
on<00:03:18.569> mine<00:03:19.200> I'm<00:03:20.069> this<00:03:20.519> one<00:03:20.700> here<00:03:21.060> I<00:03:21.209> went<00:03:21.750> ahead

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
on mine I'm this one here I went ahead

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.960 
on mine I'm this one here I went ahead
and<00:03:21.989> put<00:03:22.230> dielectric<00:03:23.160> grease<00:03:23.190> right<00:03:23.700> here

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
and put dielectric grease right here

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.059 
and put dielectric grease right here
because<00:03:24.780> that's<00:03:25.079> what<00:03:25.260> you<00:03:25.350> do<00:03:25.530> when<00:03:25.709> you<00:03:25.859> put

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
because that's what you do when you put

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.900 
because that's what you do when you put
them<00:03:26.160> on<00:03:26.329> ignition<00:03:27.410> modules<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:29.040> prevent<00:03:29.760> the

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
them on ignition modules to prevent the

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.699 
them on ignition modules to prevent the
heat<00:03:30.150> from<00:03:30.450> coming<00:03:30.630> through<00:03:31.019> and<00:03:31.260> giving

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
heat from coming through and giving

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.830 
heat from coming through and giving
these<00:03:31.829> things<00:03:32.100> too<00:03:32.310> hot<00:03:32.549> that's<00:03:33.510> what<00:03:33.629> you<00:03:33.720> do

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
these things too hot that's what you do

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.080 
these things too hot that's what you do
you<00:03:33.989> put<00:03:34.400> dielectric<00:03:35.400> grease<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:35.909> stuff

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
you put dielectric grease and stuff

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.980 
you put dielectric grease and stuff
right<00:03:36.299> here

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
right here

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.160 
right here
put<00:03:38.990> it<00:03:39.080> all<00:03:39.230> on<00:03:39.440> here<00:03:39.800> smear<00:03:40.790> it<00:03:40.880> evenly<00:03:41.270> make

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
put it all on here smear it evenly make

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.690 
put it all on here smear it evenly make
sure<00:03:42.350> you<00:03:42.440> got<00:03:42.560> enough<00:03:42.830> on<00:03:43.010> there<00:03:43.280> use<00:03:43.550> it

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
sure you got enough on there use it

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.840 
sure you got enough on there use it
liberally<00:03:44.090> and<00:03:44.770> then<00:03:45.770> we<00:03:46.460> went<00:03:46.640> ahead<00:03:46.700> and

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
liberally and then we went ahead and

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.930 
liberally and then we went ahead and
mounted<00:03:47.240> these<00:03:47.390> to<00:03:47.960> that<00:03:47.990> particular<00:03:48.940> mount

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
mounted these to that particular mount

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.840 
mounted these to that particular mount
with<00:03:50.480> dielectric<00:03:51.260> grease<00:03:51.470> on<00:03:51.860> it<00:03:51.890> here<00:03:52.730> are

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
with dielectric grease on it here are

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.199 
with dielectric grease on it here are
the<00:03:52.910> old<00:03:53.090> ones<00:03:53.300> so<00:03:54.580> we're<00:03:55.580> gonna<00:03:55.670> go<00:03:55.850> ahead<00:03:55.970> and

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
the old ones so we're gonna go ahead and

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.000 
the old ones so we're gonna go ahead and
just<00:03:56.360> go<00:03:56.660> ahead<00:03:56.720> and<00:03:56.900> put<00:03:57.080> those<00:03:57.200> back<00:03:57.500> on<00:03:57.530> here

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
just go ahead and put those back on here

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.050 
just go ahead and put those back on here
just<00:03:58.250> so<00:03:58.370> we<00:03:58.400> know<00:03:58.959> what<00:03:59.959> order<00:04:00.260> they<00:04:00.500> go<00:04:00.530> in

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
just so we know what order they go in

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.970 
just so we know what order they go in
and<00:04:02.060> then<00:04:02.930> we'll<00:04:03.050> go<00:04:03.170> ahead<00:04:03.380> and<00:04:03.470> install<00:04:03.680> this

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
and then we'll go ahead and install this

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:10.360 
and then we'll go ahead and install this
back<00:04:04.160> on<00:04:04.310> the<00:04:04.340> car<00:04:08.890> okay<00:04:09.890> this<00:04:10.070> is<00:04:10.190> what<00:04:10.340> it

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
back on the car okay this is what it

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.010 
back on the car okay this is what it
looks<00:04:10.610> like<00:04:10.700> without<00:04:11.030> the<00:04:11.300> coil<00:04:11.510> pack<00:04:11.720> on<00:04:11.930> the

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
looks like without the coil pack on the

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.250 
looks like without the coil pack on the
car<00:04:12.230> this<00:04:12.650> is<00:04:12.830> where<00:04:12.980> the<00:04:13.100> coil<00:04:13.280> packs<00:04:13.580> it's

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
car this is where the coil packs it's

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.630 
car this is where the coil packs it's
that<00:04:15.260> hole<00:04:15.620> right<00:04:15.860> there<00:04:15.920> is<00:04:16.310> the<00:04:16.459> one<00:04:16.489> that

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
that hole right there is the one that

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.360 
that hole right there is the one that
didn't<00:04:17.000> have<00:04:17.120> a<00:04:17.150> bolt<00:04:17.480> on<00:04:17.690> it<00:04:18.040> these<00:04:19.040> two<00:04:19.250> up

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
didn't have a bolt on it these two up

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.370 
didn't have a bolt on it these two up
here<00:04:19.609> did<00:04:19.970> have<00:04:20.180> retaining<00:04:20.660> bolts<00:04:21.019> that<00:04:21.169> hold

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
here did have retaining bolts that hold

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.950 
here did have retaining bolts that hold
the<00:04:21.530> bolt<00:04:21.799> that<00:04:22.220> hold<00:04:22.490> the<00:04:22.700> coil<00:04:23.150> pack<00:04:23.419> to<00:04:23.780> the

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
the bolt that hold the coil pack to the

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.800 
the bolt that hold the coil pack to the
power<00:04:24.350> steering<00:04:24.650> bracket<00:04:25.100> here<00:04:25.300> so<00:04:26.300> it's

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
power steering bracket here so it's

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.320 
power steering bracket here so it's
really<00:04:27.140> kind<00:04:27.710> of<00:04:27.860> hard<00:04:28.100> to<00:04:28.220> get<00:04:28.760> a<00:04:28.790> bolt<00:04:29.120> in

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
really kind of hard to get a bolt in

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.950 
really kind of hard to get a bolt in
there<00:04:31.060> you<00:04:32.060> know<00:04:32.180> because<00:04:32.510> this<00:04:32.690> right<00:04:32.900> here

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
there you know because this right here

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.790 
there you know because this right here
is<00:04:33.500> in<00:04:34.310> the<00:04:34.460> way<00:04:34.640> and<00:04:35.320> it's<00:04:36.320> really<00:04:36.500> difficult

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
is in the way and it's really difficult

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.590 
is in the way and it's really difficult
looking<00:04:37.400> to<00:04:37.490> get<00:04:37.700> to<00:04:37.910> it<00:04:38.060> so<00:04:38.240> we're<00:04:38.360> gonna<00:04:38.450> go

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
looking to get to it so we're gonna go

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.080 
looking to get to it so we're gonna go
ahead<00:04:38.690> and<00:04:38.780> pass<00:04:39.050> on<00:04:39.410> putting<00:04:39.740> a<00:04:39.800> new<00:04:39.980> bolt<00:04:40.310> the

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
ahead and pass on putting a new bolt the

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.300 
ahead and pass on putting a new bolt the
extra<00:04:41.419> bolt<00:04:41.660> on<00:04:41.900> there<00:04:42.140> so<00:04:42.950> we're<00:04:43.070> gonna<00:04:43.160> go

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
extra bolt on there so we're gonna go

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.040 
extra bolt on there so we're gonna go
ahead<00:04:43.370> and<00:04:43.460> mount<00:04:43.700> it<00:04:43.820> securely<00:04:44.360> to<00:04:44.660> make<00:04:44.870> sure

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
ahead and mount it securely to make sure

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.370 
ahead and mount it securely to make sure
that<00:04:45.169> it's<00:04:45.350> in<00:04:45.440> there<00:04:45.590> good<00:04:45.770> and<00:04:46.240> then<00:04:47.260> once<00:04:48.260> we

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
that it's in there good and then once we

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.530 
that it's in there good and then once we
got<00:04:48.500> it<00:04:48.680> mounted<00:04:49.040> then<00:04:49.970> I'll<00:04:50.090> go<00:04:50.210> ahead<00:04:50.300> and

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
got it mounted then I'll go ahead and

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.300 
got it mounted then I'll go ahead and
plug<00:04:50.840> the<00:04:50.990> plug<00:04:51.140> wires<00:04:51.470> in<00:04:51.710> and<00:04:51.890> what<00:04:52.040> we<00:04:52.130> did

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
plug the plug wires in and what we did

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.500 
plug the plug wires in and what we did
with<00:04:52.400> the<00:04:52.490> plug<00:04:52.729> wires<00:04:52.880> there's<00:04:53.270> went<00:04:53.450> ahead

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
with the plug wires there's went ahead

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.100 
with the plug wires there's went ahead
and<00:04:53.720> mark<00:04:54.200> them<00:04:54.490> there's<00:04:55.490> ones<00:04:56.360> over<00:04:56.660> here<00:04:56.930> and

and test drive it I think we got it
fixed<00:05:41.630> but<00:05:42.410> I<00:05:42.830> won't<00:05:43.640> know<00:05:43.820> until<00:05:43.970> we<00:05:44.180> fire<00:05:44.510> it

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:44.540 
fixed but I won't know until we fire it

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.070 
fixed but I won't know until we fire it
up<00:05:44.720> and<00:05:44.840> actually<00:05:45.110> go<00:05:45.440> for<00:05:45.650> a<00:05:45.680> drive<00:05:45.950> so<00:05:47.080> this

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
up and actually go for a drive so this

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.430 
up and actually go for a drive so this
is<00:05:48.260> the<00:05:48.380> completed<00:05:48.970> job<00:05:49.970> of<00:05:50.270> reinstalling<00:05:51.050> a
