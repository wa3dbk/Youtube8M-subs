but that doesn't mean it's biological

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.210 
but that doesn't mean it's biological

even measure the activities in the human
brain<00:01:02.339> we'd<00:01:02.879> have<00:01:03.059> no<00:01:03.299> way<00:01:03.330> of<00:01:03.600> proving<00:01:04.260> a

biochemical imbalance but we do know
from<00:01:07.290> animal<00:01:07.950> research<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.299> drugs

from animal research that the drugs

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.200 
from animal research that the drugs
cause<00:01:10.250> biochemical<00:01:11.250> imbalances<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:11.940> it's

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
cause biochemical imbalances so it's

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.330 
cause biochemical imbalances so it's

stopping a medication Prozac three days

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.500

is<00:05:40.590> your<00:05:40.740> typical<00:05:40.980> period<00:05:41.490> because<00:05:42.240> it's<00:05:42.420> a

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
is your typical period because it's a

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.110 
is your typical period because it's a
little<00:05:42.690> longer<00:05:43.110> in<00:05:43.590> effect<00:05:43.710> if<00:05:44.190> you<00:05:44.670> start<00:05:44.970> to

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
little longer in effect if you start to

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.430

feel that way that's a withdrawal

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.310 
feel that way that's a withdrawal
reaction<00:05:47.430> so<00:05:47.940> then<00:05:48.150> you<00:05:48.270> have<00:05:48.480> a<00:05:48.510> choice<00:05:48.900> about

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
reaction so then you have a choice about

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.670 
reaction so then you have a choice about
going<00:05:50.160> back<00:05:50.400> onto<00:05:50.670> medication<00:05:51.570> or<00:05:51.930> working
