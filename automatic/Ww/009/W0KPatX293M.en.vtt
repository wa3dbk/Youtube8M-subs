00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.670
 welcome guys in this brand new 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.009
 video of gta iv and it is the first time that 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.660
 it's coming to me but this is not 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.029
 means that it is the first time that the 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.980
 absolutely logical game 4 played 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.260
 also finished the stations on ps3 in 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.150
 how much precisely I bought them and precisely 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.150
 chosen gta iv as they prevent a 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.939
 this video to talk about gta 5 today 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.910
 as ray we all know gta 5 is the 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.040
 successor to gta iv of this gta 5 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.920
 nuts if you don't know a lot of things in 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.170
 what we say is being 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.079
 developed as it is in the unknown 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.210
 a trailer was released on November 2 , 2011 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.320
 so a long time ago and a trader 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.610
 that was beautiful 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.680
 so far the only trailer they have 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.719
 published and then after this trailer 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.610
 have come out but of screenshots that now 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.210
 to show we are going to analyze is 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.070
 a tough one but still not 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.690
 more news is not known a date 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.140
 exit there are rumors and he says 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.119
 which will be released in 2012 but no one knows when 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.920
 some say it will be released in 2013 but not 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.040
 it is known that in theory nothing concrete is 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.590
 there is nothing grounded here is precisely 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.840
 talking about screenshots 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.330
 analyzing the train this came out 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.830
 last 2 November 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.159
 coming these precisely these screenshots 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.460
 traders yes we say yes you can 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:30.920
 understand that perhaps even if it is now 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.470
 almost certainly this gta 5 will come 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:37.049
 set in the city of san andreas 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.240
 city ​​known to us all for the 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.770
 game about san andreas successor of 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.540
 gta vice city indeed 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.770
 but no more talk your soon 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.740
 the screenshots that have been published 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.880
 in this period and we will try to 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.880
 comment on it together here 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.110
 the first image makes us understand that there 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.030
 the bicycles will be again 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.940
 comparing it with an image of gta 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.650
 san andreas we see the well-known bridge with the 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.410
 Ferris wheel note that if not 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.330
 mistake is found in the other santos 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.690
 screenshot showing the version 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.190
 modern of the old city 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.230
 same speech for the city for affixed 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.760
 of a car we see this flight ie 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.250
 the old hydra you see from 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.830
 screenshot in modern version for gta 5 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.140
 in this other scream one notices his 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.290
 resemblance to a bridge that is found 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.820
 also in the old fan game alberto in 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.400
 this image has no comparison 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.990
 inerente a gta san andreas test 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.120
 shown anyway to make you appreciate 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.480
 the graphics that I hope will be so also in 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.930
 game 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.850
 because it's really beautiful here 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.620
 there seems to be an insertion of the 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.390
 police and most likely the police 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.270
 chases this red car 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.500
 we don't know if it will be a part 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.810
 of the main story 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.240
 this image can be associated 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.430
 the slope of the mountain killian or Gilliard 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.530
 I don't know how to pronounce it 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.090
 this mountain ciliate represents inter 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.900
 point andreas there is a road that 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:03.660
 allowed the arrival at the top of this 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.030
 of this mountain we can see here 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.040
 this villone with an adjoining field from 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.200
 tennis and precisely the people who 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.209
 they play this tennis court 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.709
 also with this he says we call the villa 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.100
 was already present to intend to are 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.900
 obviously it was not of this size 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.910
 and finally we have the latter writes that 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.890
 it represents nothing but it is anyway 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:27.690
 nice to look at because it's nice 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.160
 so these were the screenshots that 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.720
 have come out in this period or 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.300
 from the date of publication of the canvas 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.100
 real until today as I said before 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.560
 I'm a fan boy of the gta series 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.540
 how practically everyone played there 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.420
 except obviously those for psp 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.440
 because today the portable consoles precisely 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.930
 I have never had the opportunity to 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.880
 buy one and don't want to buy it 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.680
 precisely for this reason he knows what 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.230
 I expect I expect it to be really in 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.269
 san andreas because san andreas is second 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.510
 me the most varied gta because I am a 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:59.940
 brothel of things also gt4 is nice but 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.560
 let's say he doesn't have the same 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.390
 the same atmosphere he had on 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.790
 andreas is for everyone who loves me 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.160
 they ask gianpy I'd buy my gta 5 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:12.210
 answer is yes it will buy it launch because 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:16.920
 an aspect a lot gta 5 is a joke 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:18.720
 I think an epic game will come out and I hope 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.010
 which is the rockstar games it moves to 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.570
 publish it because I ca n't wait 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.690
 just to get your hands on this 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.910
 so brand new so for this video 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.940
 dedicated to cecchi a chico and for this 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.860
 short video dedicated to gt5 and his 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.450
 news and obviously are news, let's say 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.130
 very restricted as mentioned 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.870
 not much is known before 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.080
 was everything is I want to tell you another thing 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.240
 if you want in my channel other videos with 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.830
 a gta iv gameplay maybe I also have a 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.750
 video where everyone kills 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.130
 write it in the comments given that precisely 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.780
 gta iv installed I installed it 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.740
 precisely for me to record this 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.390
 gameplay 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.980
 I would also like to make videos of it 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.360
 then write it in the comments 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.370
 so if the video point is liked 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.660
 invitation to leave a like the rest 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:03.090
 resolute perceive that all is bye bye 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:05.820
 hey hey hey one last thing you what 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.570
 think of this new gt5 that stands for 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.430
 go out 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.500
 let me know with a comment so 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.870
 so that we can compare ourselves to see the 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.400
 I think of various ideas from various users 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.419
 which is a nice thing then in 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.760
 write in a comment 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:19.760
 your idea of ​​gta 5 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.900
 why
