00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.959
 So, to begin with, I'm in 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.959
 calm 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.780
 spiritually, I think that more 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.500
 solid that I never take that space 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.500
 for meditation 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:20.350
 and look for that silence that makes so much 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.850
 lack in this madness because if you are 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.369
 my itinerary says the least you have 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.500
 it's tranquility we're not here one day 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.800
 another day but if there are fairies in 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.800
 all 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.800
 and then we're not asking, we're not 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.510
 asking to have more rights than anyone 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.950
 we simply want equality and for 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.230
 many people sign that role the 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.090
 marriage is not important but for 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.550
 people like me as it is call me the 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:47.059
 option to have it I want to have that 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.699
 I want I want I want right by 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:53.030
 a thousand reasons to be calm that 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:55.809
 If something happens to me, my partner can take 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.809
 decisions for me 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.480
 is that you do not have to have to not be 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.940
 very wise to understand that this is 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.300
 basic stress is asking us to 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.270
 lower the moon is simply equality of 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.880
 rights I think the most important thing 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.100
 separate church and state do not 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.080
 can make decisions based on the 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.990
 bible I think that here we have to 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.470
 focus directly on what is the 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.740
 need of a citizen does not matter the 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.740
 country 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.550
 you can not make decisions based on 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.460
 the bible I think that here we have to 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.940
 focus directly on what is the 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.210
 need of a citizen does not matter the 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.210
 country 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.930
 you do not know that the unjust will not inherit 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.770
 the kingdom of god 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:51.920
 no arrays or fornicators or 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:55.130
 idolaters neither the adulterers nor the 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.860
 effeminate or those that are thrown with 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.100
 males 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.130
 neither the thieves nor the greedy nor the 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:08.580
 drunks or the abusers or the 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.580
 scammers will inherit the kingdom of god
