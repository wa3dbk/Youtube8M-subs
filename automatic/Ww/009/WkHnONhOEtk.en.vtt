00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.410
 a 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.529
 vitesse is preparing itself this week in spain 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:26.000
 for the second half of the season 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.039
 the arnhemmers got into the first 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.019
 a lot of compliments during the season 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.340
 showed the game but went 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.110
 ultimately as a team the 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.850
 the winter break in k preferred to have been first 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.430
 and that everyone had said with that 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.690
 football you are first 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.980
 on the other hand, we are you 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.290
 of course also a way of playing football 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.460
 have developed in recent years with 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.559
 vitesse where we want the people 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.600
 entertain but with dominant want 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.129
 where we want a lot of opportunities 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.150
 Creating and I found so little 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.309
 possibly she can give away 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.159
 well be in that part of the game 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.750
 we succeeded perfectly but I think it is 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:58.339
 a very disappointing draw where we 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.290
 stand with vertessen tenth mitten 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:02.239
 I think higher with our players 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.500
 Stand also means that there are a lot 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.180
 do not do things well, otherwise you will stand 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.710
 not in 10th place and you should n't 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.509
 due to bad luck because you can do one 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.250
 few times but not half 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:11.810
 season long so we have there 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.390
 of course with each other even in the 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.280
 first season 11 well talked about and 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.210
 that it is something that is missing because of it 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.340
 to win those competitions 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.659
 and when I look at the end of it 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.590
 the season actually from the 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.760
 competition feyenoord home twente home 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.590
 then you see that it is also something else 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.230
 have added to the game 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.730
 boys themselves and that is more real ones 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.050
 winners mentality where I particularly 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.090
 to utrecht 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.970
 I found that very disappointing, but I 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.320
 have already talked about living for my 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.430
 the group understood that feeling 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.290
 versluis still have competitions going 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.060
 lose then it is not about but the 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.830
 way we played the last matches 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.880
 have won look at ajax but also 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.590
 heracles but we still pretty 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.540
 weary came from the cup race 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.760
 where you have so much gas in the first half 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.630
 know to give then 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.880
 then I think the boys do that 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.560
 excellent the team of peter bosz 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.570
 a heavy one immediately after the winter break 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.930
 program with matches against below 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.270
 other ajax heerenveen and psv bertrand 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.909
 traore are not in principle either 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.830
 because he participates with burkina faso 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.950
 the africa cup yes that is natural for that 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.020
 us very annoying especially because it 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.340
 very good for him at that new position 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.450
 did it in rush he was important he 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.370
 scored three games in a row 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.510
 if important to the team one could 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.860
 banana lost him he was constant 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.629
 threatening 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.590
 so that's annoying that's right but also 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:27.310
 we knew this when burkina 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.680
 faso sisser 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.209
 would qualify that we put him in that 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.769
 We only know that we have lost the winter period 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.330
 not yet how long because it depends 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.220
 how long will stay in the tournament 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.690
 goalkeeper eloy room replaced for the 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.739
 winter break the injured person 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.269
 velthuizen 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.250
 field houses are now complete 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.780
 restored and peter bos so a choice 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.060
 between both keepers 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.620
 who will be the first after the winter break 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.440
 goalkeeper of vitesse 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.480
 yes you made that choice and where you 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.910
 set a nice thing about what we think 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.260
 who did excellent in the 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.209
 period that the Piet had to be replaced 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.440
 Peter didn't go out because we didn't 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.670
 were satisfied with him from Pietersd 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.250
 gone because that is 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.860
 had an injury and then you had to leave her 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.079
 treat well that is also the 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.310
 reality became hard in top sport that 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.360
 if someone else get a chance 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.319
 take your chance 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.329
 yes I also think you should 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.880
 rewarding and elodie has it excellent 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:18.459
 done in those competitions has occurred 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.859
 shown more than a worthy replacement 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.359
 for Piet because we think that's the 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:24.730
 did an excellent job and so we go 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:27.250
 started with the whole field as a trainer 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.739
 difficult because then to communicate 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.269
 Sure you are human and I am too 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.590
 I've been playing football and I do too 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.049
 agree this kind of disappointment 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.819
 processing and that is not easy 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:39.670
 and I understand that Pita is disappointed 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.620
 is over and that is also allowed 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.209
 does not take away that we of course 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.560
 expect him to look just like a nice 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.090
 done in that period 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.579
 professional with respect 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.739
 his fellow players and 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:52.450
 and that will certainly happen too 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.400
 contract from peter forest runs to it 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.870
 At the end of the season he has some 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.489
 weeks ago with club management 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.040
 talked about his future 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.239
 how are things currently going for us 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.859
 have been together once before the 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.030
 winters and we will be somewhere 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:06.760
 go together again to the winter break 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.200
 talk and there it is so important 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.900
 you can just pronounce each other 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.010
 how things really stand and that 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.910
 has the club for me for the winter 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.230
 done 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.250
 so she will be another one soon 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.739
 appointment to be made for 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.000
 follow-up conversation I'm having a huge time here 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.200
 to my liking and me 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.940
 because that it might be a weird bird 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.650
 if I'm not enjoying myself somewhere 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.810
 then I have more obligations 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.040
 to my stop afterwards but I have 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.210
 it here very good to my liking and 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.980
 I think we are among excellent 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.880
 circumstances can train on 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.530
 papendal 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.790
 i think i am with people at papendal 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.920
 collaboration was of course first 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.720
 your staff but also the people 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.340
 who work in the office that the where can I 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.680
 think it very well and very well 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.970
 cooperate tank also important and 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.590
 I also think that the club has ambition 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.080
 has one that also leaves that player group 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.030
 see that they have ambition and I think so 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.590
 that this is certainly not the end of it 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.669
 vitesse is therefore a lot of potential 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.500
 this group 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:58.150
 and I hope that together we time how 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.040
 get it out because of it 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.480
 in the month of January it is transfer 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.669
 window opened 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.860
 do they still play away or do they come? 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.300
 perhaps players are still heading our way 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.740
 I didn't expect playing on this with 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.650
 nothing at all both entering and 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.180
 not outgoing but it's soccer and 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.190
 This month can of course do a lot 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.360
 so happen suddenly in one 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.210
 rapids are coming on this 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.830
 moment nothing is going on so I expect 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.480
 frankly also a transfer 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.700
 So don't expect the forest in principle 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.919
 He is satisfied with the input from 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.410
 the three promise players timb linthorst 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:31.419
 ewout big and pretty sweet but late 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.400
 let me start that the club whole 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:34.840
 clear policy has deployed what is not 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.640
 only no it's on the first team 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.979
 in the end it's the first one 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.360
 team but from scouting and also 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:42.430
 from the youth academy must go there 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.260
 of course good players to the first 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.479
 team go so think it alone 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.210
 but good thing is that the club does a lot 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:51.070
 time and money and energy in the 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.380
 youth education that academy utrecht 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.970
 so as a very good thing and when 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.080
 guys are knocking on the door 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.370
 it is true that I have of course only one here 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.960
 few days with them worked with this 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.220
 Of course I know boys well because I do 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.560
 all matches of the promises that 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.910
 both at home and at home, so I am the boys 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.710
 actually already working weekly 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.660
 I am curious how they do it on something 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.580
 higher level a fairly high level 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.870
 how they will stand their ground alone 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.870
 you say to excellent for 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.380
 Job
