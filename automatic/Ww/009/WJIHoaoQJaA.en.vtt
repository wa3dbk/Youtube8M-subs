00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
kind of it's fun to drive it kind of

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.389 
kind of it's fun to drive it kind of
floats<00:01:27.790> down<00:01:28.090> the<00:01:28.300> road<00:01:28.920> it's<00:01:29.920> got<00:01:30.160> some

floats down the road it's got some

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:33.359 
floats down the road it's got some
interesting<00:01:30.910> features<00:01:32.070> probably<00:01:33.070> the<00:01:33.220> most

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
interesting features probably the most

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:36.570 
interesting features probably the most
obvious<00:01:33.670> one<00:01:34.210> or<00:01:34.390> the<00:01:34.509> swivel<00:01:34.930> seats<00:01:35.580> the

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
obvious one or the swivel seats the

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.669 
obvious one or the swivel seats the
seats<00:01:36.880> are<00:01:37.180> I<00:01:37.210> have<00:01:37.450> a<00:01:37.479> latch<00:01:37.780> and<00:01:38.200> a<00:01:38.289> spring

00:01:38.669 --> 00:01:38.679 
seats are I have a latch and a spring

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:41.309 
seats are I have a latch and a spring
and<00:01:38.860> you<00:01:39.640> open<00:01:39.940> the<00:01:40.030> door<00:01:40.240> and<00:01:40.270> unlatch<00:01:40.840> it<00:01:40.869> and

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:41.319 
and you open the door and unlatch it and

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:44.100 
and you open the door and unlatch it and
you<00:01:41.380> can<00:01:41.560> swivel<00:01:41.890> it<00:01:42.130> out<00:01:42.310> to<00:01:42.940> sit<00:01:43.179> in<00:01:43.300> it<00:01:43.450> it

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
you can swivel it out to sit in it it

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.109 
you can swivel it out to sit in it it
makes<00:01:44.319> it<00:01:44.530> a<00:01:44.590> little<00:01:44.709> easier<00:01:45.190> to<00:01:45.340> sit<00:01:45.580> in<00:01:45.700> it<00:01:45.880> to

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
makes it a little easier to sit in it to

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:49.410 
makes it a little easier to sit in it to
get<00:01:46.330> in<00:01:46.509> but<00:01:47.350> my<00:01:48.160> theory<00:01:48.700> is<00:01:48.910> that<00:01:48.940> they<00:01:49.390> were

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
get in but my theory is that they were

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.499 
get in but my theory is that they were
meant<00:01:49.810> more<00:01:50.140> for<00:01:50.170> women<00:01:50.770> in<00:01:51.100> that<00:01:51.940> era<00:01:52.330> the

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
meant more for women in that era the

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.010 
meant more for women in that era the
fashion<00:01:53.289> had<00:01:53.950> these<00:01:54.399> pencil<00:01:55.119> dresses<00:01:55.780> that

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
fashion had these pencil dresses that

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.160 
fashion had these pencil dresses that
were<00:01:56.200> real<00:01:56.440> long<00:01:56.709> and<00:01:57.130> tight<00:01:57.880> and<00:01:58.240> enabled

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
were real long and tight and enabled

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.190 
were real long and tight and enabled
women<00:01:59.560> to<00:01:59.770> get<00:01:59.920> in<00:02:00.130> and<00:02:00.369> out<00:02:00.459> much<00:02:01.000> easier

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
women to get in and out much easier

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.830 
women to get in and out much easier
that's<00:02:02.200> just<00:02:02.470> my<00:02:02.649> theory<00:02:03.479> some<00:02:04.479> of<00:02:04.599> the<00:02:04.690> other

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
that's just my theory some of the other

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.660 
that's just my theory some of the other
features<00:02:05.140> in<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.649> car<00:02:05.890> are<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:08.670> squarish

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
features in the car are the squarish

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.130 
features in the car are the squarish
steering<00:02:10.209> wheel<00:02:10.390> it's<00:02:10.569> called<00:02:10.780> a<00:02:10.869> narrow

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
steering wheel it's called a narrow

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.080 
steering wheel it's called a narrow
wheel<00:02:11.470> that<00:02:12.280> was<00:02:12.430> an<00:02:12.580> option

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
wheel that was an option

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.850 
wheel that was an option
takes<00:02:14.630> a<00:02:14.750> little<00:02:14.900> getting<00:02:14.990> used<00:02:15.500> to<00:02:15.620> because

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
takes a little getting used to because

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.199 
takes a little getting used to because
it's<00:02:16.160> not<00:02:16.370> round<00:02:16.610> it<00:02:17.090> has<00:02:18.020> a<00:02:18.250> 45<00:02:19.250> rpm<00:02:19.520> record

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
it's not round it has a 45 rpm record

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.979 
it's not round it has a 45 rpm record
player<00:02:20.450> there<00:02:20.720> was<00:02:20.840> a<00:02:21.099> factory<00:02:22.099> option<00:02:22.989> you

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
player there was a factory option you

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.150 
player there was a factory option you
put<00:02:24.200> about<00:02:24.410> a<00:02:24.470> dozen<00:02:24.739> records<00:02:25.130> on<00:02:25.550> 45s<00:02:26.480> and<00:02:27.160> you

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
put about a dozen records on 45s and you

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.710 
put about a dozen records on 45s and you
can<00:02:28.370> play<00:02:28.580> it<00:02:28.730> while<00:02:28.880> you're<00:02:29.030> driving

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
can play it while you're driving

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.199 
can play it while you're driving
it<00:02:30.140> doesn't<00:02:30.530> skip<00:02:30.830> too<00:02:31.069> much<00:02:31.310> if<00:02:31.940> you<00:02:32.060> had<00:02:32.180> a

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
it doesn't skip too much if you had a
