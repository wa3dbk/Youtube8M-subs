00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
gameplay in the background I was only

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.830 
gameplay in the background I was only
using<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.619> mp7<00:00:29.099> with<00:00:29.519> just<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:30.029> silencer<00:00:30.539> so

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
using the mp7 with just a silencer so

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.030 
using the mp7 with just a silencer so
thought<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.590> was<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.740> little<00:00:31.890> bit

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
thought that was a little bit

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.440 
thought that was a little bit
interesting<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.550> usually<00:00:32.820> like<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.000> run<00:00:33.210> grip

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
interesting I usually like to run grip

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.090
