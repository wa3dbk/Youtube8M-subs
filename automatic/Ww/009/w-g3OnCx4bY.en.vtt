00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.080
 Welcome to a new tutorial for 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.750
 have global counter strike weapons 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.640
 offensive in your counter strike course what 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.560
 first thing I recommend is that they do 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.510
 a backup of your folder that 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.550
 explain if the models do not like them 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.760
 or they do not serve them this only happens in 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.980
 isolated cases I leave the models in the 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.750
 description of the video one by one for 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.080
 download them just give the button 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:50.230
 download between these are the ak-47 the 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.270
 m4a1 rifles long distance pistols 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.030
 and also the terrorist and anti-terrorist teams 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.850
 terrorists inside the folders 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.800
 winrar come models sounds spirits and 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.079
 other components so that the weapons are 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.350
 see and work well it's just a matter 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.420
 to copy and replace files this 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.220
 will give much more realism to our 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.170
 game and it's very good because for those who 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.149
 can not have the original game to 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.220
 least they have their weapons identical with the 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:17.380
 same gameplay and graphics 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.600
 another very important thing is to go 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.360
 replacing the weapons individually and 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.340
 go in testing the game so if 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.560
 when they installed one of the models the 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.420
 counter strike did not work for them they will know 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.100
 that the last one they installed was the one 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.050
 the error occurred and they are going to have to put 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.880
 the original model that is in the copy 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.640
 from the folder it is extracted that we created 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.800
 previously that's all 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.050
 any question question doubt or failure 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.090
 comment if it worked for you do not forget 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:47.580
 give hand up and subscribe to 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.580
 much more, do not be subnormal and do it 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.060
 it's more 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.849
 the lack
