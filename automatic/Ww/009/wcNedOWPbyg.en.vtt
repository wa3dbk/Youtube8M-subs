 Monza race track November 14, 2010 

00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:17.979
 this is a dated proof that I will do with Alfonso 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:21.630
 this http 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.859

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.730
 he is a counselor 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.390
 performing 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.579
 to be transformed, this is the reason 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:31.990
 babylon 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.040
 decidedly sporty, reminiscent of sight 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.600
 from this moment you are a track man 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.150
 I would dare to say 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.040
 honda suction foot 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.110
 just mention the young man 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.530
 marta you look for something more 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:51.480
 You can say 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.320
 on our presence today via monza 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.780
 in this mirror 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.430
 philosophy the hell 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.680
 an initiative of the racetrack. considerably 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.100
 provides the track for a dozen weekends over the period 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.630
 there is winter when 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.390
 agonistic activity stops at the disposal of customers and normal 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.730
 Road users this to allow 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.250
 but who has the passion for carla disc motors in complete safety 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.280
 &amp; gt in a scope anyway 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.750
 ambitious than that of the Monza race track. 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.720
 yes indeed we have seen 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.050
 and we are seeing from the images 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.910
 instructive readings 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.760
 precisely they test themselves on a track that also allows 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.970
 have tourism throughout history 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.250
 all the same 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.520
 the rss feed 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.450
 to reach speed 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.450
 but unattainable smackdown 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.990
 the mind 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.600
 and by the way this weekend in particular, not by chance this test is 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.770
 dated this weekend dedicated to cups and convertibles 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.000
 so here is our test of the audi tt rs

 popular bank of the emilia 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.289
 there were 

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:15.289
 working 

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:19.999
 I'm ready to get my fill of emotion 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:24.650
 to my foot I know I have 340 horses delivered by a generous propeller of 2 

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:28.909

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.999

 compact aggressive aggressiveness 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:42.129
 characterized by the diamond-shaped front piece common to all the cars of the 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:43.939
 brand of the four winds 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.049
 the first exploration tour 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.759
 to test the car's grip in the wet 

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:51.819
 then I will progressively begin to sink the foot 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:52.620
 rather 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.339

 turning on this noble mythical track is easy to assemble one's head

 the echo on the odometer my speed and more modest so to speak 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.119
 250 times 

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:24.439
 if there were no limiter it would be a good 280 to go in the wet anyway 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:29.059
 let's say with great satisfaction in comfort in complete safety 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.680

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:40.949

 thanks to a maximum torque available in 1625 facebook you love me 

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:06.779
 what about the change of company headquarters 

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:10.749
 and his relationships favor the sports guide but the orthodox one on 

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:12.429
 roads every day 

00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:15.429
 perfect as an opening supercar with great ambitions 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.320
 some of her direct competitors come to mind, the corbetta cove 

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:21.889
 same lotus 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:25.759
 more prosaically also the list price 60,000 euros 

00:04:26.309 --> 00:04:30.059
 really content to my humble opinion so great value for money 

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:33.090
 rear wing including naturally 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.600
 from which at first sight 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.580
 all its truth shines through, already hypothesized by the compact Libya 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:45.449
 alfonso 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:48.479
 busy day to try 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.219
 the stability of this audi tt rs 

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:54.559
 definitely yes the water does not help but enhances the qualities

 naah motricity 4 

00:04:57.309 --> 00:05:00.589
 which I have to say makes it better in mode 

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:04.499
 art, and especially in conditions of extreme wet, moments in which one presses 

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:06.779
 the magic button s 

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:08.840
 things change and it takes a little more than but 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.650
 handle as the cuttlefish a little more permissive and therefore limits comes a little 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.360
 later though 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.159
 disogno 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:18.219
 really drive the car 

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:20.160
 440 horses 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.879
 at the foot 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:23.249
 behave 

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:26.490
 not only attention but also a certain sensitivity 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.110
 and if they weren't there 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.819
 all these tools then that help you 

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:35.190
 pole from electronics evidently there would be serious problems 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.539
 how it feels so good 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:37.930
 absolutely yes 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.550
 and among other things, one can really notice the difference especially in the output of 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.279
 curve or better 

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:45.650
 setting the input in q well 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.120
 r yes. 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.420
 it will lighten slightly before a front or rear wheel drive 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:55.760
 because grace on the four wheels one manages to maintain one 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.620
 cleaner, more precise trajectory and then exit with as much gas as possible 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:01.889
 outdistance 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:05.030
 not even gt3 rs like we did today 

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:10.110
 economy in that place leads the whole thing 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.110
 that make this machine a machine that projects you 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:16.259
 outside on the track 

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:18.279
 in the sense that 

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:19.449
 converges 

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:23.020
 I think an attention that is out of the car 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.919
 which is very important I think 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:29.159
 seized you have this type of shipbuilding vel. arise 

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:31.320
 absolutely to really drive 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.560
 almost a bicycle the driving position is perfect does not lack in ip cam of 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.750
 precise squeeze me out also after a few laps monzesi monza bag 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.460
 it's not really a walk 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:47.879
 on the other hand also important unfounded typhoid speeds are added 

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:52.079
 we touched the 240 250 under the water is not little 

00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:56.919
 after which I saw sportingly driving I have to admit you have two 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:06:58.369
 more numbers than my foot 

00:06:58.369 --> 00:07:00.279
 evening stand 

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:03.279
 young apologize 

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:10.020
 log in been shown to show you what you are doing with the audi tt rs 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.559
 leave the hat 

00:07:11.559 --> 00:07:13.520
 device of interest 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.310
 because from this moment better a machine does not work another aspect 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:22.210
 face other performances, ie those of a machine that does 

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:23.830
 after being on the track 

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.129
 it can satisfy the city use instead 

00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:28.089
 disappointed let's say 

00:07:28.089 --> 00:07:29.289
 of all the games all
