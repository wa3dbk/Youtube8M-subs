headstock your strings are still wrapped
around<00:02:12.459> the<00:02:12.730> tuners<00:02:13.180> so<00:02:13.930> what<00:02:14.140> you<00:02:14.260> can<00:02:14.379> do<00:02:14.560> is

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
around the tuners so what you can do is

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.979 
around the tuners so what you can do is
just<00:02:14.800> easily<00:02:15.660> unwrap<00:02:16.660> them<00:02:16.870> and<00:02:18.060> that<00:02:19.060> it

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
just easily unwrap them and that it

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.930 
just easily unwrap them and that it
should<00:02:20.019> come<00:02:20.709> right<00:02:20.739> off<00:02:21.040> depending<00:02:21.610> on<00:02:21.819> how

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
should come right off depending on how

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.839 
should come right off depending on how
long<00:02:22.090> they've<00:02:22.330> been<00:02:22.360> on<00:02:23.640> sometimes<00:02:24.640> they

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:00.449 
when you when you get to this step it's
