that he's actually eating or this is

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.910 
that he's actually eating or this is
just<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.929> Argan<00:02:11.260> grains<00:02:11.530> we

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
just the Argan grains we

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.320 
just the Argan grains we
in<00:02:12.490> general<00:02:14.130> yeah<00:02:15.130> he<00:02:15.550> does<00:02:15.790> yeah<00:02:16.120> because

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
in general yeah he does yeah because

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.890 
in general yeah he does yeah because
obviously<00:02:16.480> it'll<00:02:17.310> it<00:02:18.310> goes<00:02:18.520> down<00:02:18.790> better<00:02:19.120> okay

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
obviously it'll it goes down better okay

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.990 
obviously it'll it goes down better okay
and<00:02:20.349> what<00:02:20.739> about<00:02:20.770> drinking<00:02:21.310> water<00:02:21.520> and<00:02:21.849> things

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
and what about drinking water and things

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.089 
and what about drinking water and things
like<00:02:22.150> that

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
like that

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.410 
like that
Sookie<00:02:24.099> will<00:02:24.220> probably<00:02:24.550> tell<00:02:24.730> you<00:02:24.790> about<00:02:24.970> that

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
Sookie will probably tell you about that

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.260 
Sookie will probably tell you about that
but<00:02:25.720> there's<00:02:25.959> is<00:02:26.110> water<00:02:26.380> there<00:02:26.739> I<00:02:27.069> can't<00:02:27.940> have

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
but there's is water there I can't have

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.540 
but there's is water there I can't have
water<00:02:29.050> so<00:02:29.680> we<00:02:29.800> have<00:02:29.920> to<00:02:30.010> have<00:02:30.100> it<00:02:30.190> in<00:02:30.280> a<00:02:30.340> jelly

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
water so we have to have it in a jelly

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:31.620 
water so we have to have it in a jelly
form<00:02:30.819> it's<00:02:31.030> not<00:02:31.120> right

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
form it's not right

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
form it's not right
can<00:02:31.810> you<00:02:31.900> tell<00:02:32.080> us<00:02:32.110> a<00:02:32.170> bit<00:02:32.200> more<00:02:32.290> about<00:02:32.440> that

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
can you tell us a bit more about that

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.580 
can you tell us a bit more about that
Vicki<00:02:35.190> finish<00:02:36.190> chair<00:02:36.430> while<00:02:36.640> he's<00:02:36.819> eating<00:02:37.590> is

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
Vicki finish chair while he's eating is

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.500 
Vicki finish chair while he's eating is
because<00:02:39.100> it's<00:02:39.340> just<00:02:39.519> purely<00:02:39.880> from<00:02:40.030> a<00:02:40.120> gravity

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
because it's just purely from a gravity

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.120 
because it's just purely from a gravity
point<00:02:40.750> of<00:02:40.870> view<00:02:41.050> because<00:02:41.230> his<00:02:41.560> esophagus

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
point of view because his esophagus

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.009 
point of view because his esophagus
isn't<00:02:42.670> working<00:02:43.030> itself<00:02:43.330> to<00:02:43.540> push<00:02:43.690> the<00:02:43.840> food

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
isn't working itself to push the food

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.680 
isn't working itself to push the food
down<00:02:44.370> we<00:02:45.370> feed<00:02:45.819> him<00:02:45.940> like<00:02:46.000> this<00:02:46.360> and<00:02:46.600> then

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
down we feed him like this and then

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.360 
down we feed him like this and then
leave<00:02:46.840> him<00:02:47.019> in<00:02:47.200> this<00:02:47.380> position<00:02:47.739> for<00:02:47.769> a<00:02:48.040> short

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
leave him in this position for a short

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.340 
leave him in this position for a short
while<00:02:48.489> after<00:02:48.700> feeding<00:02:49.060> just<00:02:49.870> so<00:02:49.989> basically

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
while after feeding just so basically

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.059 
while after feeding just so basically
everything<00:02:50.830> can<00:02:50.980> move<00:02:51.250> down<00:02:52.680> with<00:02:53.680> gravity

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
everything can move down with gravity

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.100 
everything can move down with gravity
really<00:02:54.280> any<00:02:54.549> kidney<00:02:54.910> settle<00:02:55.330> any<00:02:55.720> stomach

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
really any kidney settle any stomach

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.930 
really any kidney settle any stomach
they're<00:02:56.410> not<00:02:56.860> it's<00:02:57.190> not<00:02:57.340> gonna<00:02:57.459> be<00:02:57.610> good<00:02:57.790> to

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
they're not it's not gonna be good to

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.780 
they're not it's not gonna be good to
take<00:02:58.090> anything<00:02:58.799> form<00:02:59.799> of<00:02:59.980> water<00:03:00.190> that<00:03:00.580> that

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
take anything form of water that that

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.759 
take anything form of water that that
it's<00:03:01.090> in<00:03:01.269> just<00:03:01.569> just<00:03:01.750> helps<00:03:02.049> that<00:03:02.230> motion<00:03:02.440> of

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
it's in just just helps that motion of

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.789 
it's in just just helps that motion of
them<00:03:03.150> sliding<00:03:04.150> down<00:03:04.590> okay

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
them sliding down okay

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:07.890 
them sliding down okay
also<00:03:06.340> in<00:03:06.489> this<00:03:06.610> in<00:03:06.910> his<00:03:07.030> chair<00:03:07.299> it's<00:03:07.540> not

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
also in this in his chair it's not

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.570 
also in this in his chair it's not
something<00:03:08.290> called<00:03:08.500> aspiration<00:03:09.040> Vilonia

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
something called aspiration Vilonia

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.240 
something called aspiration Vilonia
which<00:03:10.120> means<00:03:10.390> that<00:03:10.600> water<00:03:11.350> and<00:03:11.739> also<00:03:12.010> food

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
which means that water and also food

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.880 
which means that water and also food
might<00:03:12.610> go<00:03:12.850> down<00:03:13.049> the<00:03:14.049> wrong<00:03:14.200> holes<00:03:14.500> it<00:03:14.769> wrote

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
might go down the wrong holes it wrote

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.890 
might go down the wrong holes it wrote
down<00:03:15.010> a<00:03:15.069> strip<00:03:15.340> here<00:03:15.549> which<00:03:15.760> means<00:03:18.900> great

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
down a strip here which means great

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.259 
down a strip here which means great
stuff<00:03:20.170> thanks<00:03:20.590> guys<00:03:20.769> so<00:03:21.670> we're<00:03:21.880> looking<00:03:22.120> for<00:03:22.239> a

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
stuff thanks guys so we're looking for a

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:23.940 
stuff thanks guys so we're looking for a
new<00:03:22.390> home<00:03:22.600> for<00:03:22.630> Ronnie<00:03:22.959> what's<00:03:23.410> his<00:03:23.590> ideal

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
new home for Ronnie what's his ideal

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.740 
new home for Ronnie what's his ideal
home<00:03:24.220> and<00:03:24.430> Aaron<00:03:24.700> I<00:03:24.910> think<00:03:25.060> because<00:03:25.540> of<00:03:25.570> this

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
home and Aaron I think because of this

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.060 
home and Aaron I think because of this
condition<00:03:26.350> and<00:03:26.440> the<00:03:26.530> fact<00:03:26.769> that<00:03:26.890> he<00:03:27.040> just

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
condition and the fact that he just

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.330 
condition and the fact that he just
can't<00:03:27.609> have<00:03:28.239> any<00:03:28.570> food<00:03:28.989> or<00:03:29.200> water<00:03:29.470> in<00:03:29.739> a<00:03:29.980> normal

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
can't have any food or water in a normal

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.550 
can't have any food or water in a normal
position<00:03:30.489> he's<00:03:31.480> probably<00:03:31.840> gonna<00:03:32.109> have<00:03:32.320> to<00:03:32.350> be

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
position he's probably gonna have to be

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.840 
position he's probably gonna have to be
the<00:03:32.709> only<00:03:32.980> dog<00:03:33.420> an<00:03:34.420> active<00:03:34.840> family<00:03:35.079> yes<00:03:35.769> kids<00:03:36.609> I

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
the only dog an active family yes kids I

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.979 
the only dog an active family yes kids I
would<00:03:37.150> assume<00:03:37.390> an<00:03:37.959> older<00:03:38.380> older<00:03:38.829> children<00:03:39.989> but

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
would assume an older older children but

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.880 
would assume an older older children but
yeah<00:03:41.260> probably<00:03:41.920> the<00:03:42.100> only<00:03:42.340> dog<00:03:43.890> practicality

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
yeah probably the only dog practicality

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.810 
yeah probably the only dog practicality
point<00:03:45.100> of<00:03:45.220> view<00:03:45.340> really<00:03:45.660> thank<00:03:46.660> you
