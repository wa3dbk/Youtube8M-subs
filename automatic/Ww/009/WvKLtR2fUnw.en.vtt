00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
crown of the crown we have a watch this

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.210 
crown of the crown we have a watch this
large<00:03:02.900> placement<00:03:03.900> of<00:03:03.960> the<00:03:04.050> crown<00:03:04.290> but<00:03:05.070> me

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.780 
large placement of the crown but me
can't<00:03:05.880> it<00:03:06.090> makes<00:03:06.960> a<00:03:07.200> big<00:03:08.010> difference<00:03:08.460> when<00:03:08.700> you

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
can't it makes a big difference when you

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.820 
can't it makes a big difference when you
have<00:03:08.820> it<00:03:09.150> on<00:03:09.330> the<00:03:09.450> wrist<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:10.230> let<00:03:10.530> me<00:03:10.590> show<00:03:10.770> you

something that they really thought about

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:27.460 
something that they really thought about
