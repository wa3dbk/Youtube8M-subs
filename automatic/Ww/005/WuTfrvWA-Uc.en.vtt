synthetic<00:00:30.070> roll<00:00:31.770> I'm<00:00:32.770> sure<00:00:33.010> it'll<00:00:33.130> do<00:00:33.280> the

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:33.399 
synthetic roll I'm sure it'll do the

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:39.240 
synthetic roll I'm sure it'll do the
trick<00:00:37.050> before<00:00:38.050> I<00:00:38.230> took<00:00:38.290> it<00:00:38.500> off<00:00:38.620> the<00:00:38.649> bow<00:00:38.950> I

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
trick before I took it off the bow I

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.130 
trick before I took it off the bow I
marked<00:00:39.850> with<00:00:40.390> a<00:00:40.420> little<00:00:40.660> piece<00:00:40.809> of<00:00:40.840> dental

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140

floss<00:00:41.260> so<00:00:41.649> you<00:00:41.739> barely<00:00:41.950> see<00:00:42.250> it<00:00:42.450> where<00:00:43.450> I<00:00:43.480> want

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
floss so you barely see it where I want

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.900 
floss so you barely see it where I want
the<00:00:43.989> silencer<00:00:44.469> to<00:00:44.590> start<00:00:44.920> marking<00:00:45.550> on<00:00:45.640> the<00:00:45.700> top

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
the silencer to start marking on the top

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.090 
the silencer to start marking on the top
and<00:00:46.089> bottom<00:00:46.210> unwrap<00:00:46.960> it<00:00:46.989> and<00:00:47.260> making<00:00:47.469> a<00:00:47.649> little

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
and bottom unwrap it and making a little

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
loop there in between and I did the same

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.099 
loop there in between and I did the same
thing<00:00:51.100> on<00:00:51.190> the<00:00:51.280> bottom<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:52.780> here's<00:00:53.019> your

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:54.389 
thing on the bottom so here's your
synthetic<00:00:53.409> yarn<00:00:53.739> we're<00:00:53.920> gonna<00:00:54.010> give<00:00:54.249> it<00:00:54.370> a

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399 
synthetic yarn we're gonna give it a

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:57.029 
synthetic yarn we're gonna give it a
shot<00:00:54.609> see<00:00:54.909> if<00:00:54.940> it<00:00:55.089> frays<00:00:55.390> out<00:00:55.659> the<00:00:55.839> same<00:00:56.109> I'm

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
about 3/4 inches long twisted the string

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.609

but once you start fraying they're gonna

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.740 
but once you start fraying they're gonna
make<00:01:47.290> a<00:01:47.320> big<00:01:47.560> bowl<00:01:48.270> now<00:01:49.270> I'm<00:01:49.390> just<00:01:49.510> kind<00:01:49.720> of

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:08.839 

strands<00:02:01.880> of<00:02:02.030> yarn<00:02:05.830> Center<00:02:06.830> it

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
strands of yarn Center it

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.520 
strands of yarn Center it
bring<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.239> down
