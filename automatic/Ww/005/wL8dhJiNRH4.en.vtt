00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.400
 There are game sports in the world where 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.230
 the victory is to score 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.930
 more points than rivals 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.609
 and there are extreme sports win 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.920
 which is that you 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.050
 managed to survive me can fix but 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.519
 that's the way i think especially when i see 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.560
 flights to wingsuit 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.900
 on regular jumpsuits with stitched 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.210
 armpit crotch is precisely this 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.000
 sport studio gaijin and dedicated 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.520
 the game skydrive proximity flight did 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.160
 by the way her year 2 probably if not more 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.530
 at least the first mentions they're me 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.780
 I heard a project from Russians for a long time 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.480
 developers and even exclusive to 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.289
 consoles using everybody alas and kinect 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.410
 and sounds ambitious a little 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.539
 alarming 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.850
 well let's see if they succeeded 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.890
 do something interesting though they 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.510
 kinect and I don't have it, so I will 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.320
 try to play standard play 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.320
 Kursk gamepad 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:08.390
 so each level starts with one 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.820
 and the same your hero stands on top 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.190
 some mountain and after pressing a button 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.840
 self-destructively jumping down and further 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.180
 all fall process management 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.830
 transferred to your hands and you with the help 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.770
 dual shock gyro 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.750
 control flight direction 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.330
 tilted down and begin to dive 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.659
 gamepad on yourself and trying to climb in 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.460
 sky 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.380
 rejected left or right and 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.750
 accordingly turn it 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.860
 basic maneuvering base further 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.440
 begin tricks 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.360
 so where do without them here too 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.970
 there is nothing difficult to accomplish 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.190
 Each find a is answered by the X plus button. 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.140
 X here trick whichever way 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.240
 your gamepad was sent to the ward 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.670
 skydiver will do one thing or another 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.600
 and in silhouette you can probably 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.690
 count 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.110
 two barrels left and right two forward flips 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.000
 and back plus a corkscrew and basically everything yes 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.590
 if you make you cool from very close 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.899
 to the ground it goes on separate 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.240
 categories of proxy tricks but in fact it 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.819
 all the same barrel flips and corkscrew only 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.250
 beside the ground for it just gives more 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.239
 points like this is a continuous combo of 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.160
 various screws 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.989
 shorter for sure you all played in the tone 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.330
 withers any and understand how 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.310
 this system works up to the monogram network 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.860
 your hero grows a strip of adrenaline 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.890
 that's it that's looking like upside down 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.629
 Nike emblem using it your 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.420
 character in some physical way 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:31.550
 manages either to speed up or just 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.090
 Blur the edges of the screen without 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.860
 speedometer is hard to understand before starting 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.349
 each jump is allowed to change itself 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.140
 hero they differ in three indicators 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:44.510
 mass speed and maneuverability during 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.370
 flight if you are particularly uporotyh you can 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.459
 change the standard camera to the view from under 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.170
 Wings but from him almost no can 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.150
 it looks realistic but 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.430
 driving here is quite problematic yes 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.530
 and dizzy most likely well 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.870
 at the end of your flight you need to open 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.090
 parachute and make a landing but 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.629
 In general, the game allows it landing landing 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.460
 losses 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.650
 believe you will 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.490
 it is faster and the penalty is no 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.500
 accrued 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.810
 Now, when we met with 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.910
 new planning and frills no honor 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.250
 let's find out where it all apply 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.680
 what are the three main modes this 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.140
 race assignment and freestyle 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.480
 with this task are divided by 4 to 2 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.270
 up to 1 are routes where necessary as you can 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.700
 faster fly through the circles hovering in 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.530
 heaven and always more than necessary therefore 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.200
 If you missed a couple, then nothing 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.390
 scary unless you get 3 stars 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.730
 hi angri bird the second is basic 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.100
 tricks considering tutorial on how to do 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.400
 the simplest kent and the third is 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:46.760
 additional tasks that in fact too 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.090
 about litanyki circles just accurately 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.190
 same there is no difference at all and 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.930
 last this is a difficult job i go 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.660
 I want to stay in more detail 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.340
 mastered past missions approximately 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.100
 thirty to forty minutes 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.680
 and having received from two to three stars I 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.880
 I'm not joking, but in these difficult tasks I do not 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.920
 went further 1 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.780
 since perform 10 corkscrew in a row 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.090
 turned out to be an impossible task for me 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.010
 tried for 20 minutes from scoring 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.440
 and the funny thing is that I just can't 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.780
 skip to the next level 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.110
 I have to get at least one star 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.300
 and since I can not then everything for example 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.110
 Take again the angry birds and all 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.960
 cat ze roup 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.970
 with a similar rating system and stages if 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.800
 you goof and you can not pass some place 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.890
 always allowed to skip it and 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.380
 come back later and then the figs turn to 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.900
 freestyle again what is there to go far 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.940
 on any of the eight cards and let them here 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.950
 only 8 of course there are several points 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.350
 start but it 's like the track backwards 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.090
 ahead racing like and turn and others 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.550
 but in fact the same soup 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.860
 so just jump and start and 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.780
 unscrew tricks task to dial the right 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.650
 number of points for bronze and silver and 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.280
 gold is all well and the third mode is 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.620
 adrenaline race 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.780
 he is the only competitive 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.610
 massive suicide from the mountain you will 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.770
 carried out in the company of three artificial 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.750
 flyers and your task is to overtake them and 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.940
 come first 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.680
 and a niche that by the way is done wrong 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.450
 just because you have to constantly 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.580
 balance on the line for the sake of dialing 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.680
 speed and adrenaline if 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.270
 you crashed somewhere not just like in 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.520
 latest games codemasters 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.900
 you can take and rewind time back that 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.730
 funny amount of rewinds 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.560
 unlimited therefore you can at least every 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.330
 10 meters to use them but 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.070
 everything is unwound until the very start 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.110
 somewhere around 5 seconds total 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.120
 so sometimes you can very well 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.370
 vstryat driven themselves almost hopeless 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.440
 position and spend a few minutes on 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:41.140
 so that by trial and error get out 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:44.320
 from this trap but I even once 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:47.620
 coped and came first yes only one 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.600
 because there are only 4 of these races 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.310
 there are even two times less than cards in 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.390
 I think the game additional comments 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.160
 unnecessary here 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:57.460
 sort of like you can still with friends 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.500
 compete but I don’t have them 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.150
 the specific mechanism is unknown to me 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.830
 however, considering that in fact 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.660
 you can try jumping with any 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.430
 the man from the highscore table is just 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.320
 having downloaded his ghost i have 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.700
 suspicion that as such joint 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.370
 there is no multiplayer at all 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.290
 but only exchange of replays is sad 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.360
 because having fun with a friend 

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:20.040
 ram it in the air and stuff 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.910
 could add some fun to the game 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.620
 perhaps lovers like 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.870
 skytime let stupidly 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.850
 like although they are probably more interesting in 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:29.350
 real life jump but private 

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:32.020
 gamer is unlikely this game will be able 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:34.120
 delay on the long screen can still 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.490
 be if almost all tasks can be completed 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:39.280
 in an hour and a half but considering what you are 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:42.220
 know how to do a corkscrew but seriously 1 hour and 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.080
 23 minutes so much I spent and fulfilled 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.760
 almost all on 2 3 stars 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.800
 and besides gave out almost half 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.510
 Voy trophies in other words 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.910
 it is worth playing only if you have 

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:54.160
 that's a wild desire to find out what 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:56.350
 skydiving and try it without risking 

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.479
 my life and I remind you that if the game 

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:01.410
 such a blow will cost you only 10,000 

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:05.110
 points then in real you die nafig 

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:06.670
 one with broken bones somewhere on 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:09.390
 mountainside 

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:09.390
 have a good day
