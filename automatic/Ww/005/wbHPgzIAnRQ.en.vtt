but I went with the mystic LED and the

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.900 
but I went with the mystic LED and the
reason<00:01:00.719> being<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.500> seems<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.129> cover<00:01:02.340> more

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
reason being is it seems to cover more

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.929 
reason being is it seems to cover more
space<00:01:03.229> than<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.619> other<00:01:05.189> lights<00:01:05.430> I've<00:01:05.640> played

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
space than the other lights I've played

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.810 
space than the other lights I've played
with<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:06.420> bang<00:01:07.200> for<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.560> buck<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:08.159> coverage

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
with so bang for the buck and coverage

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.010 
with so bang for the buck and coverage
wise<00:01:09.060> i<00:01:09.390> think<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.860> mystic<00:01:11.220> LED<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:12.020> nother

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
wise i think the mystic LED is a nother

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.890 
wise i think the mystic LED is a nother
