00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.729 

next<00:01:03.270> I'm<00:01:03.359> adding<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.719> piece<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:04.049> foam<00:01:04.260> board<00:01:04.530> to

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
next I'm adding a piece of foam board to

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.500 
next I'm adding a piece of foam board to
the<00:01:04.860> bottom<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.339> box<00:01:05.580> because<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.119> realized

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
the bottom of the box because I realized

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.359 
the bottom of the box because I realized
that<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.750> was<00:01:06.900> too<00:01:07.110> deep<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.979> the

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
that it was too deep and that the

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.890 
that it was too deep and that the
lipsticks<00:01:08.820> were<00:01:08.970> actually<00:01:09.210> going<00:01:09.360> too<00:01:09.630> low

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
lipsticks were actually going too low

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.330 
lipsticks were actually going too low
and<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.140> wouldn't<00:01:10.380> be<00:01:10.470> able<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.710> grab<00:01:11.040> them

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
and I wouldn't be able to grab them

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.090 
and I wouldn't be able to grab them
after<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.360> do<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.990> measure<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.650> width<00:01:13.860> and

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
after I do that I measure the width and

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.480 
after I do that I measure the width and
length<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.670> inside<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.150> box<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:16.490> then

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
length of the inside of the box and then

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.390 
length of the inside of the box and then
I<00:01:17.580> create<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.119> grid<00:01:18.509> basically<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:19.380> measured<00:01:20.130> the

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
I create a grid basically I measured the

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.039 
I create a grid basically I measured the
width<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.939> lipstick<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.479> realized<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:21.960> it

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
width of a lipstick and realized that it

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.109 
width of a lipstick and realized that it
was<00:01:22.140> about<00:01:22.350> 1<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.610> created<00:01:23.850> this

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
was about 1 in it and so I created this

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.760 
was about 1 in it and so I created this
sheet<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.450> paper<00:01:24.750> just<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.470> could<00:01:25.650> go

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
sheet of paper just so that I could go

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.350 
sheet of paper just so that I could go
through<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.250> measure<00:01:26.400> really<00:01:26.880> quickly

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
through and measure really quickly

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:36.350 
through and measure really quickly
one-inch<00:01:27.979> sections<00:01:34.460> and<00:01:35.460> at<00:01:36.000> first<00:01:36.150> you're

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
one-inch sections and at first you're

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.630 
one-inch sections and at first you're
going<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.630> measure<00:01:36.840> along<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.470> width<00:01:37.680> the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
going to measure along the width the

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.060 
going to measure along the width the
width<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:39.000> my<00:01:39.150> box<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.720> 6<00:01:40.140> inches<00:01:40.590> in<00:01:40.890> the

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
width of my box is 6 inches in the

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.850 
width of my box is 6 inches in the
length<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.520> 8<00:01:41.790> inches<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.200> will<00:01:43.560> create

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
length is 8 inches and so I will create

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.960 
length is 8 inches and so I will create
six<00:01:44.340> columns<00:01:45.500> each<00:01:46.500> column<00:01:47.009> is<00:01:47.100> 1<00:01:47.280> inches<00:01:47.729> and

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
six columns each column is 1 inches and

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.929 
six columns each column is 1 inches and
then<00:01:48.869> as<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.170> go<00:01:49.320> along<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.770> length<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.340> will<00:01:50.430> do

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
then as I go along the length I will do

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.660 
then as I go along the length I will do
once<00:01:51.270> again<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.720> one<00:01:51.960> inch<00:01:52.490> measurement<00:01:53.490> and

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
once again that one inch measurement and

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.569 
once again that one inch measurement and
I<00:01:53.729> will<00:01:53.880> be<00:01:54.000> at<00:01:54.090> 8<00:01:54.299> columns<00:01:56.390> and<00:01:58.310> then<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.399> cut

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
I will be at 8 columns and then I cut

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.789 
I will be at 8 columns and then I cut
out<00:01:59.670> pieces<00:01:59.729> of<00:02:00.210> foam<00:02:00.390> board<00:02:00.689> some<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.680> them

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
out pieces of foam board some of them

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.920 
out pieces of foam board some of them
are<00:02:02.040> 6<00:02:02.430> inches<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:02.969> then<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.270> other<00:02:03.509> ones<00:02:03.780> are

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
are 6 inches and then the other ones are

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
are 6 inches and then the other ones are
8<00:02:04.170> inches<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:05.960> then<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:06.990> line<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.500> pieces

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
8 inches and then I line the pieces

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.940 
8 inches and then I line the pieces
inside<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.910> box<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.840> start<00:02:10.170> marking<00:02:10.709> each

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
inside the box and I start marking each

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.150 
inside the box and I start marking each
piece<00:02:11.220> of<00:02:11.400> foamboard<00:02:11.780> where<00:02:12.780> it<00:02:13.200> intercepts

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
piece of foamboard where it intercepts

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.970 
piece of foamboard where it intercepts
at<00:02:14.400> so<00:02:14.730> on<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.090> grid<00:02:15.330> where<00:02:15.720> you<00:02:15.870> see<00:02:16.110> like<00:02:16.410> the

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
at so on the grid where you see like the

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.460 
at so on the grid where you see like the
cross<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.489> X's<00:02:17.970> for<00:02:18.239> me<00:02:18.420> that's<00:02:18.750> where<00:02:19.020> I<00:02:19.050> put

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
cross the X's for me that's where I put

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.130 
cross the X's for me that's where I put
the<00:02:20.280> marks<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:20.790> then<00:02:20.970> I<00:02:21.000> also<00:02:21.209> did<00:02:21.540> that<00:02:21.569> for

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
the marks and then I also did that for

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.410 
the marks and then I also did that for
the<00:02:22.319> length<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.459> marked<00:02:23.819> on<00:02:23.940> there<00:02:24.150> every

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
the length so I marked on there every

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.670 
the length so I marked on there every
time<00:02:24.840> it<00:02:25.349> would<00:02:25.980> cross<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:27.349> basically<00:02:28.349> once

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
time it would cross and basically once

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.580 
time it would cross and basically once
you<00:02:29.069> mark<00:02:29.760> one<00:02:30.239> of<00:02:30.269> them<00:02:30.569> then<00:02:30.870> all<00:02:31.140> of<00:02:31.440> the

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
you mark one of them then all of the

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.619 
you mark one of them then all of the
eight<00:02:31.769> inches<00:02:32.250> will<00:02:32.550> have<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.910> same<00:02:33.150> marks

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
eight inches will have the same marks

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.229 
eight inches will have the same marks
and<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:34.319> same<00:02:34.530> thing<00:02:34.769> for<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.160> 6<00:02:35.459> inch<00:02:35.730> once

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
and the same thing for the 6 inch once

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.270 
and the same thing for the 6 inch once
you<00:02:36.390> mark<00:02:36.720> one<00:02:36.959> six-inch<00:02:37.530> piece<00:02:37.800> you<00:02:38.040> can<00:02:38.190> go

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
you mark one six-inch piece you can go

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.400 
you mark one six-inch piece you can go
ahead<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:38.670> use<00:02:38.819> that<00:02:38.849> as<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.150> template<00:02:39.690> to<00:02:39.870> mark

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
ahead and use that as a template to mark

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.949 
ahead and use that as a template to mark
the<00:02:40.920> same<00:02:41.190> areas<00:02:41.640> on<00:02:41.879> every<00:02:42.330> one<00:02:42.540> of<00:02:42.629> the<00:02:42.750> other

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
the same areas on every one of the other

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.550 
the same areas on every one of the other
six<00:02:43.440> inch<00:02:43.680> pieces<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:45.170> that<00:02:46.170> is<00:02:46.290> where<00:02:46.470> I'm

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
six inch pieces and that is where I'm

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.500 
six inch pieces and that is where I'm
actually<00:02:46.709> going<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.099> cut<00:02:47.370> out<00:02:47.519> sections<00:02:47.879> from

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
actually going to cut out sections from

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.900 
actually going to cut out sections from
the<00:02:49.170> foam<00:02:49.650> board<00:02:49.920> but<00:02:50.459> before<00:02:50.790> I<00:02:50.819> start

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
the foam board but before I start

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.089 
the foam board but before I start
cutting<00:02:51.269> I<00:02:51.540> actually<00:02:51.629> want<00:02:52.050> to<00:02:52.319> measure<00:02:52.739> out

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
cutting I actually want to measure out

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:56.420 
cutting I actually want to measure out
where<00:02:53.400> I<00:02:53.730> want<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:54.810> stop<00:02:55.349> cutting<00:02:55.650> so<00:02:56.160> I'm

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
where I want to stop cutting so I'm

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.160 
where I want to stop cutting so I'm
going<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:56.760> cut<00:02:56.940> all<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.150> way<00:02:57.269> up<00:02:57.510> to<00:02:57.720> this<00:02:57.900> line

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
going to cut all the way up to this line

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.220 
going to cut all the way up to this line
this<00:02:58.560> is<00:02:58.709> about<00:02:58.860> less<00:02:59.159> than<00:02:59.190> half<00:02:59.459> way<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.300> so

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
this is about less than half way and so

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.190 
this is about less than half way and so
I'm<00:03:01.500> going<00:03:01.739> to<00:03:01.800> take<00:03:02.069> my<00:03:02.690> exacto<00:03:03.690> knife<00:03:03.930> and

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
I'm going to take my exacto knife and

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.680 
I'm going to take my exacto knife and
start<00:03:04.650> cutting<00:03:05.069> out<00:03:05.280> sections<00:03:06.060> from<00:03:06.300> the<00:03:06.480> foam

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
start cutting out sections from the foam

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.490 
start cutting out sections from the foam
board<00:03:06.989> and<00:03:08.569> this<00:03:09.569> is<00:03:09.750> what<00:03:09.900> I'm<00:03:10.019> talking<00:03:10.440> about

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
board and this is what I'm talking about

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.070 
board and this is what I'm talking about
cutting<00:03:11.129> out<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.640> sections<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.390> then<00:03:12.690> they

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
cutting out the sections and then they

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.020 
cutting out the sections and then they
will<00:03:13.290> fit<00:03:13.530> together<00:03:13.709> like<00:03:13.980> this<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.580> 8<00:03:14.730> inch

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
will fit together like this the 8 inch

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.600 
will fit together like this the 8 inch
pieces<00:03:15.930> will<00:03:16.110> fit<00:03:16.349> into<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.890> six<00:03:17.129> inch<00:03:17.340> pieces

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
pieces will fit into the six inch pieces

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.500 
pieces will fit into the six inch pieces
like<00:03:18.030> this

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.259 

so<00:03:24.019> once<00:03:24.260> you<00:03:24.409> have<00:03:24.620> them<00:03:25.159> all<00:03:25.400> cut<00:03:25.819> out<00:03:25.849> send

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
so once you have them all cut out send

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:27.759 
so once you have them all cut out send
them<00:03:26.450> then<00:03:26.690> you<00:03:26.840> should<00:03:26.870> be<00:03:27.140> able<00:03:27.260> to<00:03:27.379> put<00:03:27.590> them

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
them then you should be able to put them

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:33.699 
them then you should be able to put them
together<00:03:27.950> and<00:03:28.519> form<00:03:28.879> this<00:03:30.069> grid<00:03:32.590> so<00:03:33.590> they

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
together and form this grid so they

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:34.899 
together and form this grid so they
should<00:03:33.890> all<00:03:33.980> fit<00:03:34.159> together<00:03:34.310> and<00:03:34.760> they<00:03:34.849> should

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:34.909 
should all fit together and they should

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:47.440 
should all fit together and they should
all<00:03:35.150> just<00:03:35.330> fit<00:03:35.540> into<00:03:35.750> your<00:03:36.200> box<00:03:36.560> like<00:03:36.890> this<00:03:46.450> and

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
all just fit into your box like this and

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:48.970 
all just fit into your box like this and
that<00:03:47.870> is<00:03:47.989> how<00:03:48.140> you<00:03:48.200> create<00:03:48.530> it<00:03:48.620> I<00:03:48.709> hope<00:03:48.830> you

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
that is how you create it I hope you

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.830 
that is how you create it I hope you
