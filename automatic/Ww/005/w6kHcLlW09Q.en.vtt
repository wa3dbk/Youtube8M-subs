00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.530
 so let's make a sweet dish and 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.940
 we call it earth and chocolate 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.190
 we have the ingredients here a little 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.220
 so you can see how we mount the plate 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.370
 I say a little bit how we do it and you see 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.870
 how easy is haute cuisine so 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.480
 we started with a little bit of praline 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:27.070
 hazelnuts that we're going to anoint the prize of 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.690
 hazelnuts we make it with cocoa hazelnuts 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.930
 and a little cream 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:35.200
 we put the plate together to hold the 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.200
 sand 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.300
 but here we have 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.030
 these are some fairy chocolate crumbs 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.469
 so we put some nuts in 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.570
 flour a little bit of cocoa a little 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:50.019
 butter and a little bit of boletus in 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.519
 freeze-dried powder then we do with 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:53.440
 a kind of sand we put it in the 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:55.390
 oven and in a syn 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.539
 turns with a spatula until it 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.670
 it is crispy and it looks like this 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:04.049
 is where we put the sand so it does not 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.049
 let's go from the plate 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.640
 we have it well spread well then as 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.480
 you know when we go but we see that 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.580
 there's always a little bit of moss 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.390
 dew then we will put a 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.430
 little bit of pistachio only crushed 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.549
 so that I give a little color to the 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.600
 grass that grows 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.570
 Then you know that there are a few 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.549
 stones also when when you go 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.259
 singing with the field then the stone 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:34.840
 We make it with a little bit of hazelnut 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.119
 with a hazelnut and a little bit 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.420
 of caramelized sugar to the cove and 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.700
 we get this no more or less where 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.429
 we put a little bit the little stones 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.860
 you have to have a lot of fantasy to 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:49.509
 the kitchen because if not then it is 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.459
 monotonous then we have to have 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.770
 fantasy and say let's recreate the 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:55.659
 hell as we recreate the winter by 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.109
 with products 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:01.659
 and giving in the coloring that we have 

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:04.530
 put the stones we are going to put 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:08.530
 a little dehydrated raspberry 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.390
 to give it the contrast and some fruits 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:16.400
 reds such as blueberries 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:19.340
 the raspberry the currant looking for them 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.830
 sloes of the field we have the pastelito 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.030
 in the writing a good cupcake this is 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.670
 a cookie covered with chocolate 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.410
 what we do with flour and butter and 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.610
 let's put it here on this edge that 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.610
 is going to hold the cake 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:38.610
 and we will make a sweet wine jelly 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.879
 and we cut it a little bit 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.910
 we always use 300 grams 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.810
 per 3 grams of vegetable gelatine or cola 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.290
 of fish 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:54.700
 and then we cut it in little pieces, sorry 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:57.520
 and we are going to distribute a few 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.720
 and on these little pieces we are going to put 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.720
 some aniseed buds 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.160
 and those can sell in stores 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.280
 Gourmet are buds that usually know how to read 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.800
 to me if they evoke you a little bit good 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.800
 I put this because it is very from Madrid 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:23.380
 so then 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:26.090
 helps us recreate the herbs we put 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.420
 a little bit we have here a graffiti 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.690
 [Music] 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.690
 Hello 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:40.890
 we are putting the leaves of the 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:42.750
 trees the nice thing is to have fun if you do not 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.470
 have fun do not have fun 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:49.290
 cooking that I recommend it so 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:52.140
 take note e come now let's put 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.950
 a few sprigs of chocolate as if they were 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.950
 the roots of the trees 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.920
 the logs that are intertwined between 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.430
 the herbs 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.430
 the sand 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:11.120
 and we put a cake that is made 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.120
 with pistachio chocolate hazelnuts 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.579
 they paint it, we bathe with a little 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.579
 chocolate 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.840
 and we put a pistachio 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.220
 to shine with a little oil 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.220
 olive 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:41.010
 we put the leaves that we need if 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.010
 let's go with the liver now 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:48.300
 and we do not take away and well that's 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:51.210
 being that we already make it a landscape of 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:54.210
 total winter 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:56.940
 good to hold the finger we put 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.340
 a droplet of candy because if not 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.770
 when the dish is not always there 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.120
 tempered can melt us 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.280
 so we put a little bit of 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.690
 Camita so the ice cream does not melt 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.800
 that is one of the tricks that you must 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.780
 keep in mind when you put an ice cream 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.000
 in a dish 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:17.500
 and to finish we put some sheets of 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.510
 mint because I do not know 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.470
 a little mint mint because because we 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.470
 it gives a bit of freshness 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.950
 to camps or peppermint then the ice cream 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:31.210
 of mint we make it with the leaves of 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:33.860
 mint infused, add a little 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:36.290
 innate stabilizers and ice cream comes out 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:39.620
 perfect we put it in our hands 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:41.729
 we have the adore is what happens and good 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:45.629
 this would be the dessert 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:48.729
 and nothing I hope you like that you do 

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:52.919
 at home if you have time 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:52.919
 and that I'm progress
