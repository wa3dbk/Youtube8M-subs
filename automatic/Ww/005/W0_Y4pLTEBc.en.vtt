00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.819
 kia properties think and motive and see 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:11.310
 what will happen here we will obviously add 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.809
 property quota years 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.119
 and here I will add to this properties 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.119
 like this 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:20.429
 bruni 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:22.619
 here are the edges 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.069
 so also 

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:27.189
 I'll try to do something different 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:28.070
 so active 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.070
 position 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.500
 but let absolute 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.120
 play with absolute 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.270
 positioning 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.660
 so crowds 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.660
 the way will not be there 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.900
 the column has to look at the heights and 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.410
 broke away 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.260
 126 pixel plus chest is there we take 120 pixels 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.780
 and rubles and you 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.550
 UTB pixel son shos st 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.830
 Now let's see what we have this car supposedly 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.090
 I will explain that to facilitate the interface 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.230
 I generally produce kp 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.680
 so I drove their own 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.040
 went to Moscow very far 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.410
 Neptune 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.410
 now in your back 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.810
 tons 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.360
 if u will be two times decreased 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.360
 we'll see 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.570
 this is of course more true 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.600
 so to sense now 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.600
 99 pixels set 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.850
 go and top maevskaya 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.180
 but I understand the general Czech cleared echoes 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.270
 shove 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.100
 this one 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.880
 I want to shove him 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.270
 here are the ships from st 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.180
 dock so that everything looked 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.530
 fine 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.500
 Him vividly way of dealing 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.910
 I wondered about the island position absolute uh block 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.069
 horizontal menu 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.010
 and but its coordinates are height and its and at least 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.829
 something 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:16.669
 which means a tire deposit is absolute 

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:19.849
 generally speaking if we use diva blocks 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:22.839
 we have one Kiev dam 

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:23.980
 On the page 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.259
 that is, there are cues 

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:28.749
 it has some width and height 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:31.760
 and this is our father Soligorsk 

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:34.149
 Emelino's photo comedian one more cues 

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:35.690
 also has some 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.690
 m width and height over there 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.599
 when we have a percentage of normal flow 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.409
 these blocks are located alone 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:45.429
 under the arms 

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:47.540
 point tamales flow this without any 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.099
 absolutely fule 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.679
 a number of other types of positioning 

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:55.159
 without any task wrapping blocks and here 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:56.569
 one for the other 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.369
 if this blog is really because 

00:02:58.369 --> 00:03:01.089
 that from Kiev to the reception and from the unit 

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:03.299
 by silence, will it make 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.719
 chip element 

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:07.069
 so good 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.870
 or for example, and here I am such a lower topic 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.670
 set the properties of their position absolute mott 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:13.929
 this kiev 

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:16.429
 I will have a position absolute 

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:18.819
 what does it mean it means given 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.689
 type breaks out of 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:23.609
 n normal by the way that if he is not 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.279
 will already go 

00:03:25.279 --> 00:03:28.310
 year top motives which percentage by 

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:30.869
 which document goes above it 

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:32.639
 and will be positioned 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.559
 absolutely on the page as specified 

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:36.889
 coordinates 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:39.099
 and coordinates will be set 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.119
 about this left here 

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:41.859
 corner 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.339
 That is, it is clear that the yacht has a coordinate 

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:46.609
 will be set in that direction and 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:47.240
 everything 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.570
 top carotene nato in this direction and in 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:50.229
 term 

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:51.649
 that is, in this way will be 

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:53.999
 formed by 100 thousand left above 

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:56.779
 and this one that has those now 

00:03:56.779 --> 00:03:59.870
 style position absolute property style 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:00.939
 position absolute 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:02.589
 it can overlap 

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:04.449
 even this asset 

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:07.129
 it all depends on what kind of it 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:09.349
 indexes parameters but indexes 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.889
 in style given for this diva for this 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:12.699
 asset 

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:15.029
 inject from the VAT area that percentage 

00:04:15.029 --> 00:04:17.139
 Kiev is higher 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.009
 surface 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:21.889
 so good if the account of the opposition 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:22.610
 Vaneev 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.650
 read positioning 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.219
 position real iker what does it mean it means 

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:29.279
 that this one here 

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:31.680
 whose feet are Rosatom Mayor 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.350
 but on the properties 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.270
 in the style of quiet position you make 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.680
 we have it 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.620
 but again it breaks out 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.599
 normal normal flow 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:44.689
 but position now happens neither 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:47.449
 regarding him the seller was him 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:48.270
 depressed 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.419
 but relative to its original 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.509
 the position that is, here it was with us 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:53.360
 put out 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.009
 and we can relatively him 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:57.530
 this position is important experience 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:58.789
 white stork dislodge 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:00.379
 poplar can insert 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:01.869
 negative value then he 

00:05:01.869 --> 00:05:02.379
 will be 

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:04.659
 either move in either direction 

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:07.009
 and again either the supreme court three 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:08.900
 face either down 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.560
 so good ambitions have figured it out yet 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.490
 one such interesting point here we have 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:15.620
 percent 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.770
 our compote food year village document in it 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.630
 there is so big here 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:21.919
 tikhvin 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.479
 inside of this diva is another one 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:25.979
 type of 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:29.100
 external kiev motors set meters 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:31.960
 enter areola position properties 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.039
 and inside it is absolute 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:37.529
 Moreover, if we do not ask her, then we assume 

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:39.809
 the process of giving pozishn and those who 

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:41.860
 we block estesno move nowhere 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:42.599
 will be 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:44.949
 but such a block and which 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:47.399
 assigned assignment to deposits 

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:48.860
 absolutely 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:49.650
 percent 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:50.990
 positioned will happen 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.080
 relative to the upper left corner 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.839
 parent wolves 

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:56.419
 no hope for upper left 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:58.269
 browser relative 

00:05:58.269 --> 00:06:00.719
 upper left corner of the parent side 

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:03.839
 but okay with that 

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:05.259
 I am now 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:07.650
 with the help of these about the displacement of the topal earth 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.089
 put 

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:10.189
 percent 

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:12.509
 well, this one here is baccarat he menu in 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:14.059
 Right place 

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:16.300
 I think everything will work out 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.620
 here and if anything confuses me 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:19.759
 be this one 

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:21.369
 corner 

00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:24.029
 runs it he can climb on the text of his 

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:25.449
 content 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:28.449
 percent but here is tsu content 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:31.080
 how will I fight it 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.189
 well, just i can take and make 

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:35.269
 more here here toast toto 

00:06:35.269 --> 00:06:35.960
 on top of 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.020
 then everything will be hockey 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.550
 so oh well about the kinetic 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.340
 and then well in the next lesson you 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.559
 see that 

00:06:46.559 --> 00:06:48.289
 already here it costs so much where 

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:48.870
 need to 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.320
 and we will post with you here 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.639
 menu items
