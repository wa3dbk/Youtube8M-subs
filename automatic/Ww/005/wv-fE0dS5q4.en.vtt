00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:28.259 
to fix the intonation in it so what

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:29.480 
to fix the intonation in it so what
we're<00:00:28.380> talking<00:00:28.500> about<00:00:28.710> is<00:00:29.009> how<00:00:29.160> we<00:00:29.189> would

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
we're talking about is how we would

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:37.190 
we're talking about is how we would
practice<00:00:34.520> and<00:00:35.520> how<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:35.910> really<00:00:36.329> improve<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.989> so

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
we can hear the intonation properly so

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.190 
we can hear the intonation properly so
if<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.180> could<00:00:39.329> just<00:00:39.480> play<00:00:39.690> me<00:00:39.840> from<00:00:40.050> that

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
if you could just play me from that

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:51.169 
passage just that far as you're playing
it<00:00:48.769> so<00:00:49.769> it<00:00:49.890> starts<00:00:50.219> off<00:00:50.339> absolutely<00:00:50.879> fine

00:00:51.169 --> 00:00:51.179 
it so it starts off absolutely fine

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:52.549 
it so it starts off absolutely fine
what's<00:00:51.420> really<00:00:51.839> hard<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.199> hear<00:00:52.379> with

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
what's really hard to hear with

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.669 
what's really hard to hear with
semitones<00:00:53.149> is<00:00:54.149> when<00:00:54.600> they're<00:00:54.780> too<00:00:54.989> wide<00:00:55.320> or

00:00:55.669 --> 00:00:55.679 
semitones is when they're too wide or

semitones is when they're too wide or
too<00:00:55.739> narrow<00:00:55.940> what<00:00:56.940> we<00:00:57.059> need<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.300> make<00:00:57.480> sure

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
too narrow what we need to make sure

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:05.050 
too narrow what we need to make sure
with<00:00:57.780> this<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.199> are<00:00:58.320> matching<00:00:58.649> notes<00:00:59.070> so

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.060 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.190 

all<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.270> notes<00:01:06.420> match<00:01:06.600> all<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.810> beef<00:01:06.960> Maps

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
all the notes match all the beef Maps

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.490 
all the notes match all the beef Maps
match<00:01:07.440> all<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.920> C<00:01:08.100> sharps<00:01:08.460> match<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:09.440> way<00:01:10.440> to

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
match all the C sharps match a way to

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.290 
match all the C sharps match a way to
bring<00:01:10.800> it<00:01:10.920> down<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.340> practice<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.880> we've

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
bring it down to practice it we've

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.149 
bring it down to practice it we've
talked<00:01:12.510> about<00:01:12.659> before<00:01:13.110> it's<00:01:13.740> hooking<00:01:14.070> the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
talked about before it's hooking the

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.670 
talked about before it's hooking the
bone<00:01:17.659> so<00:01:18.659> we<00:01:18.780> can<00:01:18.900> hear<00:01:19.079> the<00:01:19.200> connection

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
bone so we can hear the connection

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.959 
bone so we can hear the connection
between<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.100> notes<00:01:20.250> can<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.490> just<00:01:20.670> let<00:01:20.790> me

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:20.969 
between the notes can you just let me

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:22.850 
between the notes can you just let me
very<00:01:21.270> slowly<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.810> want<00:01:22.020> everything<00:01:22.409> very

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
very slowly and I want everything very

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:36.490 
very slowly and I want everything very
slow<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.310> controlled<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:23.759> all<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.030> ships

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.020 

this<00:01:37.500> chip<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.920> what<00:01:38.160> I<00:01:38.190> don't<00:01:38.460> want<00:01:38.640> anything

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
this chip I what I don't want anything

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.700 
this chip I what I don't want anything
jacket<00:01:39.510> so<00:01:39.660> what<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:39.870> had<00:01:40.140> then<00:01:42.230> so<00:01:43.230> you<00:01:43.290> jacked

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
jacket so what I had then so you jacked

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.810 
jacket so what I had then so you jacked
it<00:01:43.830> in<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.040> bone<00:01:44.190> which<00:01:44.400> means<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.730> your

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
it in the bone which means that your

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.580 
it in the bone which means that your
body<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.210> reacting<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.930> we<00:01:46.230> just<00:01:46.260> need<00:01:46.470> to

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
body is reacting to it we just need to

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:55.050 
body is reacting to it we just need to
keep<00:01:46.650> Turkey<00:01:47.070> car

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.630 

so<00:01:55.990> which<00:01:56.649> notes<00:01:56.890> were<00:01:57.040> you<00:01:57.130> not<00:01:57.280> happy<00:01:57.430> with

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
so which notes were you not happy with

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:07.170 
so which notes were you not happy with
that<00:01:57.820> time

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.660 

how<00:02:08.050> are<00:02:08.140> you<00:02:08.229> going<00:02:08.410> to<00:02:08.470> find<00:02:08.679> that<00:02:08.830> a<00:02:09.039> how<00:02:09.460> far

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
how are you going to find that a how far

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:23.190 
how are you going to find that a how far
you<00:02:09.850> shifting<00:02:21.540> so<00:02:22.540> if<00:02:22.690> we're<00:02:22.840> going<00:02:23.020> to<00:02:23.110> an

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
you shifting so if we're going to an

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.820 
you shifting so if we're going to an
articulation<00:02:23.620> shape<00:02:25.290> that's<00:02:26.290> how<00:02:26.500> far<00:02:26.680> the

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
articulation shape that's how far the

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.490 
articulation shape that's how far the
hand<00:02:27.190> is<00:02:27.310> go

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.470 

so<00:02:29.920> if<00:02:30.100> you<00:02:30.190> have<00:02:30.340> a<00:02:30.370> shift<00:02:30.640> which<00:02:31.270> is

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
so if you have a shift which is

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.000 
so if you have a shift which is
constantly<00:02:32.020> on<00:02:32.080> every<00:02:32.500> time<00:02:32.680> you<00:02:32.800> play<00:02:32.980> it

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
constantly on every time you play it

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.040 
constantly on every time you play it
it's<00:02:33.430> not<00:02:33.730> in<00:02:33.910> tune<00:02:34.090> you<00:02:34.240> can't<00:02:34.480> work<00:02:34.630> out<00:02:34.780> why

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
it's not in tune you can't work out why

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.930 
it's not in tune you can't work out why
you<00:02:35.620> need<00:02:35.800> to<00:02:35.890> work<00:02:35.980> out<00:02:36.100> how<00:02:36.310> far<00:02:36.520> the<00:02:36.580> hand<00:02:36.820> is

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
you need to work out how far the hand is

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.170 
you need to work out how far the hand is
going<00:02:37.120> to<00:02:37.210> shift<00:02:37.570> so<00:02:38.700> just<00:02:39.700> shifting<00:02:39.970> down<00:02:40.120> a

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
going to shift so just shifting down a

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:48.000 
going to shift so just shifting down a
tone<00:02:40.480> so<00:02:41.080> can<00:02:41.230> you<00:02:41.290> just<00:02:41.410> pay<00:02:41.650> me<00:02:47.010> articulator

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
tone so can you just pay me articulator

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.430 
tone so can you just pay me articulator
shins

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:03:02.760 

just<00:02:52.220> practice

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.590 

so<00:03:03.340> we<00:03:03.490> would<00:03:03.640> repeat<00:03:03.940> that<00:03:04.180> shipped<00:03:04.420> over

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
so we would repeat that shipped over

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.600 
so we would repeat that shipped over
again<00:03:04.930> Naevia<00:03:05.290> you're<00:03:05.560> very<00:03:05.860> aware<00:03:05.980> you<00:03:06.460> need

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
again Naevia you're very aware you need

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.490 
again Naevia you're very aware you need
to<00:03:06.760> pinpoint<00:03:07.180> which<00:03:07.600> note<00:03:07.810> has<00:03:07.960> a<00:03:07.990> problem

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
to pinpoint which note has a problem

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:40.660 
to pinpoint which note has a problem
so<00:03:08.710> now<00:03:08.890> pay<00:03:09.160> me<00:03:09.190> much<00:03:09.430> more<00:03:09.610> front

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.100 

so<00:03:41.000> do<00:03:41.120> you<00:03:41.180> notice<00:03:41.360> when<00:03:41.660> we're<00:03:41.810> doing<00:03:41.900> like

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
so do you notice when we're doing like

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.839 
so do you notice when we're doing like
this<00:03:42.290> everything<00:03:42.950> is<00:03:43.040> very<00:03:43.130> controlled<00:03:43.670> and

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
this everything is very controlled and

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:45.400 
this everything is very controlled and
there's<00:03:43.970> no<00:03:44.120> excess<00:03:44.450> tension<00:03:44.690> at<00:03:45.050> the<00:03:45.110> moment

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
there's no excess tension at the moment

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.350 
there's no excess tension at the moment
I'm<00:03:45.500> still<00:03:45.739> seeing<00:03:45.980> you<00:03:46.280> clenching<00:03:47.000> your<00:03:47.060> jaw

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
I'm still seeing you clenching your jaw

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.180 
I'm still seeing you clenching your jaw
a<00:03:47.390> little<00:03:47.660> bit<00:03:47.810> and<00:03:47.959> being<00:03:48.140> stressed<00:03:48.739> about<00:03:48.920> it

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
a little bit and being stressed about it

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.880 
a little bit and being stressed about it
if<00:03:49.430> we<00:03:49.700> can<00:03:49.880> absolutely<00:03:50.180> get<00:03:51.080> away<00:03:51.319> from<00:03:51.380> any

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
if we can absolutely get away from any

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.470 
if we can absolutely get away from any
of<00:03:52.130> that<00:03:52.310> excess<00:03:52.670> tension<00:03:52.849> so<00:03:53.180> that<00:03:53.209> we're

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
of that excess tension so that we're

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.030 
of that excess tension so that we're
just<00:03:53.750> practicing<00:03:53.959> the<00:03:54.260> shift<00:03:54.470> and<00:03:54.680> we<00:03:54.769> don't

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
just practicing the shift and we don't

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.180 
just practicing the shift and we don't
have<00:03:55.220> any<00:03:56.140> anything<00:03:57.140> extraneous<00:03:57.830> to<00:03:57.950> put<00:03:58.069> us

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
have any anything extraneous to put us

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.580 
have any anything extraneous to put us
off<00:03:58.400> so<00:03:59.120> that<00:03:59.540> would<00:03:59.750> be<00:03:59.870> step<00:03:59.930> one<00:04:00.140> of

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
off so that would be step one of

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.620 
off so that would be step one of
practicing<00:04:00.950> that<00:04:01.040> ination<00:04:01.370> intonation<00:04:01.940> then

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
practicing that ination intonation then

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:09.039 
practicing that ination intonation then
I<00:04:02.660> would<00:04:02.900> go<00:04:07.299> through<00:04:08.299> each<00:04:08.450> note<00:04:08.720> becomes

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
I would go through each note becomes

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:10.780 
I would go through each note becomes
more<00:04:09.290> prominent<00:04:09.530> so<00:04:10.190> you're<00:04:10.310> still<00:04:10.519> doing<00:04:10.549> the

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
more prominent so you're still doing the

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.250 
more prominent so you're still doing the
hook<00:04:11.239> and<00:04:11.450> you're<00:04:11.540> practicing<00:04:11.660> connection

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
hook and you're practicing connection

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:25.020 
hook and you're practicing connection
between<00:04:12.380> those<00:04:12.709> just<00:04:13.130> say<00:04:13.250> that<00:04:13.489> to<00:04:13.819> me

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.160 

you're<00:04:26.030> going<00:04:26.240> to<00:04:26.330> practice<00:04:26.510> that<00:04:26.870> to<00:04:27.050> be<00:04:27.140> a

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
you're going to practice that to be a

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:34.590 
you're going to practice that to be a
good<00:04:27.740> and<00:04:28.010> the<00:04:28.100> next<00:04:28.400> step<00:04:28.610> would<00:04:29.120> be<00:04:30.190> stop

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.150 

that<00:04:35.600> way<00:04:35.810> you<00:04:36.350> know<00:04:36.650> that<00:04:36.890> you're<00:04:36.980> taking

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
that way you know that you're taking

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.470 
that way you know that you're taking
control<00:04:37.430> of<00:04:37.700> each<00:04:37.970> note<00:04:38.180> that<00:04:38.360> you're<00:04:38.450> playing

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
control of each note that you're playing

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.860 
control of each note that you're playing
when<00:04:39.020> you<00:04:39.110> get<00:04:39.290> it<00:04:39.440> up<00:04:39.590> to<00:04:39.620> pay<00:04:39.830> advance<00:04:40.870> you

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
when you get it up to pay advance you

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.840 
when you get it up to pay advance you
will<00:04:42.020> know<00:04:42.200> that<00:04:42.230> you<00:04:42.950> decide<00:04:43.370> the<00:04:43.550> way<00:04:43.640> to<00:04:43.700> put

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
will know that you decide the way to put

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.310 
will know that you decide the way to put
the<00:04:43.910> fingers<00:04:44.120> move<00:04:44.300> toward<00:04:44.570> the<00:04:45.050> muscle

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
the fingers move toward the muscle

00:04:45.320 --> 00:05:06.190 
the fingers move toward the muscle
memory<00:04:45.590> so<00:04:45.770> just<00:04:46.100> pay<00:04:46.250> me<00:04:46.430> now<00:05:05.050> that's<00:05:06.050> the

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
memory so just pay me now that's the

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.780 
memory so just pay me now that's the
shift<00:05:06.410> we're<00:05:06.530> going<00:05:06.680> practice<00:05:07.130> so<00:05:07.520> that's

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
shift we're going practice so that's

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
shift we're going practice so that's
what<00:05:08.060> you're<00:05:08.180> going<00:05:08.300> to<00:05:08.360> do<00:05:08.450> in<00:05:08.540> your<00:05:08.630> practice

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
what you're going to do in your practice

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.700 
what you're going to do in your practice
alone<00:05:09.790> and<00:05:10.790> so<00:05:11.390> that<00:05:11.570> this<00:05:11.690> is<00:05:11.750> just<00:05:11.990> one<00:05:12.500> way

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
alone and so that this is just one way

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.740 
alone and so that this is just one way
of<00:05:12.740> practicing<00:05:13.490> intonation<00:05:14.000> especially<00:05:14.600> in

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
of practicing intonation especially in

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.860 
of practicing intonation especially in
these<00:05:14.870> nasty<00:05:15.200> passages<00:05:15.770> of<00:05:15.800> poplar<00:05:16.720> where<00:05:17.720> he

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
these nasty passages of poplar where he

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.210 
these nasty passages of poplar where he
throws<00:05:18.050> us<00:05:18.230> all<00:05:18.380> over<00:05:18.710> the<00:05:18.800> place<00:05:19.010> but

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
throws us all over the place but

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.650 
throws us all over the place but
basically<00:05:19.700> what<00:05:19.850> he's<00:05:19.970> teaching<00:05:20.270> us<00:05:20.300> is<00:05:20.480> hand

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
basically what he's teaching us is hand

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.750 
basically what he's teaching us is hand
positions<00:05:21.140> so<00:05:21.650> if<00:05:21.830> we're<00:05:22.040> very<00:05:22.370> everything

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
positions so if we're very everything

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.610 
positions so if we're very everything
it's<00:05:23.000> very<00:05:23.060> deliberate<00:05:23.660> we<00:05:23.900> can't<00:05:24.200> let

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
it's very deliberate we can't let

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.680 
it's very deliberate we can't let
anything<00:05:24.979> just<00:05:25.580> happen<00:05:25.820> by<00:05:25.940> chance<00:05:25.970> we<00:05:26.510> have

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
anything just happen by chance we have

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.050 
anything just happen by chance we have
to<00:05:26.720> put<00:05:26.960> the<00:05:27.020> notes<00:05:27.229> down<00:05:27.669> proper<00:05:28.669> studies

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
to put the notes down proper studies

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.250 
to put the notes down proper studies
have<00:05:29.180> written<00:05:29.360> to<00:05:29.540> teach<00:05:29.720> us<00:05:29.870> how<00:05:29.930> to<00:05:30.020> play<00:05:30.200> the

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
have written to teach us how to play the

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.800 
have written to teach us how to play the
cello<00:05:30.440> better<00:05:30.940> and<00:05:31.940> that<00:05:32.150> that's<00:05:32.479> what<00:05:32.660> we're

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
cello better and that that's what we're

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:33.969 
cello better and that that's what we're
looking<00:05:32.990> here<00:05:33.050> to<00:05:33.169> do<00:05:33.260> so<00:05:33.440> we<00:05:33.590> need<00:05:33.620> to<00:05:33.800> be<00:05:33.919> in

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:33.979 
looking here to do so we need to be in

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:35.620 
looking here to do so we need to be in
control<00:05:34.130> of<00:05:34.430> everything<00:05:34.640> we're<00:05:34.880> doing<00:05:35.000> so

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
control of everything we're doing so

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.030 
control of everything we're doing so
that's<00:05:35.930> how<00:05:36.169> I<00:05:36.200> want<00:05:36.500> you<00:05:36.560> to<00:05:36.650> practice<00:05:36.919> this

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:37.040 
that's how I want you to practice this

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.740 
that's how I want you to practice this
whole<00:05:37.340> section<00:05:38.650> so<00:05:39.650> hooked<00:05:40.070> bowing<00:05:40.540> and<00:05:41.540> then

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
whole section so hooked bowing and then

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.780 
whole section so hooked bowing and then
integrase<00:05:42.169> note<00:05:42.470> hooks<00:05:42.800> and<00:05:43.100> then<00:05:43.580> it's<00:05:43.729> a

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:43.790 
integrase note hooks and then it's a

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.870 
integrase note hooks and then it's a
separate<00:05:44.210> and<00:05:44.450> then<00:05:44.870> you<00:05:45.169> can<00:05:45.320> start<00:05:45.880> playing

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
separate and then you can start playing

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.430 
separate and then you can start playing
it<00:05:47.000> very<00:05:47.030> slowly<00:05:47.360> and<00:05:47.540> properly<00:05:47.900> I<00:05:48.050> would<00:05:48.260> also

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
it very slowly and properly I would also

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.469 
it very slowly and properly I would also
do<00:05:48.680> it<00:05:48.740> with<00:05:48.830> a<00:05:48.890> metronome<00:05:49.280> even<00:05:50.120> working<00:05:50.330> out

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 
do it with a metronome even working out

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:52.659 
do it with a metronome even working out
the<00:05:50.630> speed<00:05:50.870> this<00:05:51.590> that's<00:05:51.890> the<00:05:52.040> nastiest<00:05:52.460> bit

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:52.669 
the speed this that's the nastiest bit

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:54.909 
the speed this that's the nastiest bit
of<00:05:52.790> this<00:05:52.940> and<00:05:53.180> this<00:05:53.270> study<00:05:53.570> and<00:05:54.169> really<00:05:54.590> watch

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:54.919 
of this and this study and really watch

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:56.020 
of this and this study and really watch
that<00:05:55.130> you're<00:05:55.220> keeping<00:05:55.460> your<00:05:55.550> shoulders<00:05:55.910> down

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
that you're keeping your shoulders down

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.180 
that you're keeping your shoulders down
and<00:05:56.360> that's<00:05:56.510> no<00:05:56.690> excess<00:05:57.050> tension<00:05:57.229> anyway<00:05:57.650> good

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
and that's no excess tension anyway good

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.660 
and that's no excess tension anyway good
so<00:05:58.460> that's<00:05:58.640> how<00:05:58.760> we<00:05:58.820> would<00:05:58.910> rehearse<00:05:59.120> this<00:05:59.419> bit
