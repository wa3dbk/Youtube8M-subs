00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
lot of games a lot of teams so I feel

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.959 
lot of games a lot of teams so I feel
like<00:01:45.200> we<00:01:45.799> really<00:01:45.979> go<00:01:46.219> in<00:01:46.369> each<00:01:46.579> week<00:01:46.819> just

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 
like we really go in each week just

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:49.510 
like we really go in each week just
trying<00:01:47.240> to<00:01:47.359> redeem<00:01:48.109> ourselves<00:01:48.350> from<00:01:48.770> the

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
trying to redeem ourselves from the

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.340 
trying to redeem ourselves from the
performance<00:01:49.999> we<00:01:50.119> had<00:01:50.270> last<00:01:50.479> year<00:01:50.749> and<00:01:51.139> games

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
performance we had last year and games

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.410 
performance we had last year and games

kind<00:01:53.479> of<00:01:53.630> what<00:01:53.810> drives<00:01:53.959> us<00:01:54.350> to<00:01:54.999> play<00:01:55.999> at<00:01:56.119> a<00:01:56.149> high

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:56.209 
kind of what drives us to play at a high
