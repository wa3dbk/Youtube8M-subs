00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:14.660
 hello with you tatyana scolded and we 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.400
 we will sort it out with you 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.550
 original dress 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:23.029
 which I found in the online store over 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.340
 albau it pays for can be purchased at 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.550
 this store and for those who are interested 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.820
 sew your own hands then I will help you 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.910
 reveal it and so what is here 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.040
 interesting yes all interesting just 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.390
 the cut is so simple 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:44.780
 but he looks so original you 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:49.309
 probably not deny, and so the two 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:52.840
 dresses in one bottom paid apparently 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:55.910
 it is paid sewn from thin on or 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:59.770
 cotton fabric thin 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:04.430
 it is paid as a case 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:07.640
 bottom dress and top here such as 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:13.429
 Cape tunic in general is called 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:17.780
 dress and so special patterns and not necessary 

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:20.119
 for the payment of course the bottom just 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.330
 to their size immediately on the fabric 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.929
 carve out such a dress but what about 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.929
 tunics 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:34.580
 let's say I took licked folded it on 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:39.729
 in half now I am from the center 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:46.000
 I will postpone the width of the cut which I need 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:48.319
 let's say 10 12 and you make 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.880
 6 centimeters will 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:57.830
 shoulder shoulder seam next we will do 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:00.110
 I will arm everything as I taught you and on basic 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.470
 mesh size 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:09.349
 build these details here you are from the shoulder 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:10.990
 the seam and about it all the rest we 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:17.290
 draw us on 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:20.100
 they are a rectangle like this if we 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.650
 put a rectangle to this point 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:28.720
 axillary set rectangle 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:37.810
 rovnenko and here and draw the side seam 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:42.280
 right here we will do exactly please 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:45.480
 the pattern is ready I certainly did on 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.820
 small here on small 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:52.180
 little cloth found and now 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:54.610
 see what we did on the pattern 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.270
 i made and on fabric 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.290
 Now here as we have for the slot 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.360
 side seams 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.660
 here in this place is just stapled for 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:08.290
 in order to stitch in sleeves but in this 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.240
 place the glue we will hang but so 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:14.680
 how's my cotton piece 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:19.170
 fabrics he is not silky and pretty 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:23.500
 it's hard to show you the effect of these 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:29.220
 at the bottom of the corners, I hope you don't care 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:31.620
 I understand these how they add up below 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.190
 by lenght 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:39.310
 peeps is paid second you can 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:43.480
 perform the second platica lower together 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:47.430
 like covers and hides ie stitch to 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:51.940
 shoulder seams can be worn as 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.690
 separately that is a separate thing 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.960
 processed moved them 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:02.300
 you see on the model how it is made as 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:05.570
 it looks and that's probably all I think 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.240
 that nothing complicated is the limit 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:13.430
 Spinochka and shelf equally 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:15.890
 the only thing on the front of the sleeve 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:22.160
 cutout will certainly be more 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:26.510
 Here in this place wprime glasses and back 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.550
 part of us or the front part will be 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:33.500
 a little lower 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:37.970
 and the back is taller well are you on 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:40.550
 Based on the already shouts that you can 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:43.550
 build a base light you draw and 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:47.870
 back and shelf here is this part of the phone 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:51.530
 and you will sew up the sleeve sleeve is the same 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:54.440
 know how to sew on my method 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:57.410
 therefore, labor will not be all that 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:02.810
 I wanted to tell you about it 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:06.130
 It embodied all the best of luck to you 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.130
 you were Tatyana scolded
