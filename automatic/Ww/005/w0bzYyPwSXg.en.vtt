I was like I just think it's really
pretty<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.180> he<00:00:42.719> we<00:00:43.200> made<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> bet

pretty and he we made a bet

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.830 
pretty and he we made a bet
we're<00:00:44.040> like<00:00:44.190> if<00:00:44.340> it's<00:00:44.520> less<00:00:44.700> than<00:00:44.879> $300<00:00:45.539> you're
