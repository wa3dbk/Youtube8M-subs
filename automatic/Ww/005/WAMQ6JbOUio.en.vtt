00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.170 
pretty good you go up to this top part
here<00:02:17.860> and<00:02:18.860> that's<00:02:19.040> a<00:02:19.130> lot<00:02:19.280> of<00:02:19.310> shockwave<00:02:19.970> you

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
here and that's a lot of shockwave you

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.300 
here and that's a lot of shockwave you
can<00:02:20.329> see<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:20.600> different<00:02:20.900> color<00:02:21.170> here<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:22.220> you

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
can see the different color here and you

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.900 
can see the different color here and you
can<00:02:22.459> see<00:02:22.610> where<00:02:22.760> this<00:02:22.850> peeled<00:02:23.209> back<00:02:24.820> that's<00:02:25.820> a

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
can see where this peeled back that's a

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.340 
can see where this peeled back that's a
lot<00:02:26.060> of<00:02:26.090> damage<00:02:26.390> that's<00:02:26.690> a<00:02:26.750> lot<00:02:26.870> of<00:02:26.900> trauma

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
lot of damage that's a lot of trauma

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.449 
lot of damage that's a lot of trauma
coming<00:02:28.220> out<00:02:28.370> of<00:02:28.459> that<00:02:28.579> round<00:02:29.890> as<00:02:30.890> we<00:02:31.160> go<00:02:31.310> on

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
coming out of that round as we go on

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.590 
coming out of that round as we go on
down<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:32.090> then<00:02:32.420> back<00:02:32.870> over<00:02:32.930> to<00:02:33.290> this<00:02:33.410> side<00:02:34.600> you

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
down and then back over to this side you

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.050 
down and then back over to this side you
can<00:02:35.750> see<00:02:35.959> where<00:02:36.170> it<00:02:36.230> just<00:02:36.410> kept<00:02:36.560> going<00:02:36.950> so<00:02:37.910> it

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
can see where it just kept going so it

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.090 
can see where it just kept going so it
got<00:02:38.390> done<00:02:38.600> doing<00:02:38.810> all<00:02:39.110> of<00:02:39.200> its<00:02:39.320> moving<00:02:39.709> but

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
got done doing all of its moving but

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.580 
got done doing all of its moving but
that's<00:02:40.610> deep<00:02:41.150> deep<00:02:41.480> deep<00:02:43.390> deep<00:02:44.390> cuts<00:02:44.870> from<00:02:45.500> the

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
that's deep deep deep deep cuts from the

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.150 
that's deep deep deep deep cuts from the
petals<00:02:47.170> it's<00:02:48.170> just<00:02:48.350> a<00:02:48.470> very<00:02:48.709> high-powered

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
petals it's just a very high-powered

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.319 
petals it's just a very high-powered
round<00:02:51.400> travel<00:02:52.400> pretty<00:02:52.609> far

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
round travel pretty far

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:56.949 
round travel pretty far
I<00:02:53.359> mean<00:02:53.810> I'll<00:02:53.930> definitely<00:02:54.890> retest<00:02:55.370> it<00:02:55.959> with

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
I mean I'll definitely retest it with

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.839 
I mean I'll definitely retest it with
some<00:02:57.170> more<00:02:57.350> media<00:02:57.680> behind<00:02:58.100> it<00:02:58.459> so<00:02:58.580> we<00:02:58.700> can

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
some more media behind it so we can

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:00.250 
some more media behind it so we can
definitely<00:02:59.269> capture<00:02:59.420> how<00:02:59.720> far<00:02:59.930> this<00:03:00.080> is<00:03:00.230> going

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
definitely capture how far this is going

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.410 
definitely capture how far this is going
but<00:03:00.470> look<00:03:00.620> at<00:03:00.739> all<00:03:00.830> the<00:03:00.980> denim<00:03:01.340> it<00:03:01.610> just<00:03:01.970> dumped

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
but look at all the denim it just dumped

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.020 
but look at all the denim it just dumped
it

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
it

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.130 
it
that's<00:03:05.030> what<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:05.240> round<00:03:05.450> looks<00:03:05.690> like<00:03:05.900> you<00:03:06.020> can

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
that's what the round looks like you can

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.270 
that's what the round looks like you can
tell<00:03:06.290> there's<00:03:06.470> a<00:03:06.530> different<00:03:06.830> style<00:03:06.980> hollow

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
tell there's a different style hollow

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.020 
tell there's a different style hollow
point<00:03:07.580> on<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:07.820> gold<00:03:08.030> dot<00:03:09.700> it's<00:03:10.700> a<00:03:10.760> shallow

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
point on the gold dot it's a shallow

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.270 
point on the gold dot it's a shallow
gold<00:03:11.450> dot<00:03:11.660> so<00:03:11.930> it's<00:03:12.110> using<00:03:12.350> the<00:03:12.590> velocity<00:03:13.130> to

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
gold dot so it's using the velocity to

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.220 
gold dot so it's using the velocity to
open<00:03:13.580> it<00:03:13.700> instead<00:03:14.030> of<00:03:14.150> a<00:03:14.240> big<00:03:14.480> big<00:03:14.870> flying

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
open it instead of a big big flying

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.950 
open it instead of a big big flying
ashtray<00:03:15.740> like<00:03:15.920> some<00:03:16.100> of<00:03:16.190> the<00:03:16.250> others<00:03:16.490> do<00:03:16.960> you

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:17.960 
ashtray like some of the others do you

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.060 
ashtray like some of the others do you
can<00:03:18.110> see<00:03:18.260> on<00:03:18.380> this<00:03:18.530> side<00:03:18.770> look<00:03:19.010> at<00:03:19.070> that

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
can see on this side look at that

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.900 
can see on this side look at that
discoloration<00:03:22.070> peel<00:03:22.850> back<00:03:24.670> it's<00:03:25.670> a<00:03:25.700> pretty

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
discoloration peel back it's a pretty
