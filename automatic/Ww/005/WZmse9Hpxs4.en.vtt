00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
megapixel camera on the back and there's

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.540 
megapixel camera on the back and there's
a<00:02:46.660> flash<00:02:46.960> here<00:02:47.350> and<00:02:47.590> remember<00:02:48.190> this<00:02:48.400> has

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
a flash here and remember this has

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.450 
a flash here and remember this has
autofocus<00:02:48.850> as<00:02:49.360> well<00:02:49.770> I'll<00:02:50.770> just<00:02:50.830> pull<00:02:51.340> this

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
autofocus as well I'll just pull this

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.190 
autofocus as well I'll just pull this
off<00:02:51.670> and<00:02:52.230> see<00:02:53.230> that<00:02:53.380> this<00:02:53.470> is<00:02:53.710> a<00:02:54.150> aluminum

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
off and see that this is a aluminum

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.480 
off and see that this is a aluminum
brushed<00:02:56.200> aluminum<00:02:58.830> frosted<00:02:59.830> aluminum<00:03:00.280> the

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
brushed aluminum frosted aluminum the

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.420 
brushed aluminum frosted aluminum the
finish<00:03:00.790> black<00:03:01.300> and<00:03:02.010> we'll<00:03:03.010> just<00:03:03.070> check<00:03:03.280> out

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
finish black and we'll just check out

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:15.230 
finish black and we'll just check out
the<00:03:03.550> ports<00:03:03.850> in<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.000> build<00:03:04.380> so

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.120 

so<00:03:15.900> this<00:03:16.050> looks<00:03:16.200> like<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:17.900> the<00:03:18.900> SD<00:03:19.620> card<00:03:19.650> slot

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
so this looks like the the SD card slot

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.220 
so this looks like the the SD card slot
and<00:03:21.110> this<00:03:22.110> one<00:03:22.350> is<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.800> micro<00:03:23.160> SD<00:03:24.230> power

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
and this one is the micro SD power

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:33.260 
and this one is the micro SD power
button<00:03:25.590> volume<00:03:25.800> up<00:03:26.610> volume<00:03:26.640> down<00:03:27.920> Mike<00:03:32.270> and

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
button volume up volume down Mike and

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.430 
button volume up volume down Mike and
over<00:03:34.080> here<00:03:34.290> at<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.560> top<00:03:35.450> we<00:03:36.450> have<00:03:36.480> a<00:03:36.630> 3.5

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
over here at the top we have a 3.5

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.030 
over here at the top we have a 3.5
millimeter<00:03:37.470> headphone<00:03:38.070> jack<00:03:38.960> micro<00:03:39.960> USB<00:03:40.530> and

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
millimeter headphone jack micro USB and

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.890 
millimeter headphone jack micro USB and
HDMI<00:03:41.580> port<00:03:43.310> so<00:03:44.310> lets<00:03:44.820> up<00:03:44.970> our<00:03:45.240> this<00:03:45.420> baby<00:03:45.660> on

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
HDMI port so lets up our this baby on

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.560 
HDMI port so lets up our this baby on
and<00:03:45.930> I<00:03:46.860> mean<00:03:47.100> hopefully<00:03:47.310> it<00:03:47.520> has<00:03:47.670> should<00:03:48.420> have

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
and I mean hopefully it has should have

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.410 
and I mean hopefully it has should have
power<00:03:48.840> well<00:03:49.140> those<00:03:49.260> are<00:03:49.410> D<00:03:49.500> is<00:03:49.590> powered<00:03:49.830> on<00:03:49.950> too

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
power well those are D is powered on too

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.060 
power well those are D is powered on too
so<00:03:51.420> actually<00:03:52.020> I'll<00:03:52.170> pair<00:03:52.440> it<00:03:52.590> off<00:03:52.740> and<00:03:52.950> then

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
so actually I'll pair it off and then

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.440 
so actually I'll pair it off and then
power<00:03:53.310> it<00:03:53.370> out<00:03:53.520> so<00:03:53.670> you<00:03:53.730> can<00:03:53.850> see<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.150> boot<00:03:54.330> up

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
power it out so you can see the boot up

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.600 
power it out so you can see the boot up
screen<00:03:54.480> and<00:03:54.900> all<00:03:54.990> that<00:03:55.110> good<00:03:55.260> stuff<00:03:58.400> so<00:03:59.400> again
