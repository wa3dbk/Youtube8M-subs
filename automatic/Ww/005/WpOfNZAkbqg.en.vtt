00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.180 

if<00:03:35.390> you<00:03:35.659> wanted<00:03:36.049> you<00:03:36.200> can<00:03:36.319> bring<00:03:36.709> out<00:03:36.860> a<00:03:36.890> lot<00:03:37.099> of

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
if you wanted you can bring out a lot of

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:43.020 
if you wanted you can bring out a lot of
harmonics<00:03:37.760> by<00:03:38.060> doing<00:03:38.360> the<00:03:38.540> guitar<00:03:38.930> thing

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.570 

I<00:03:43.060> think<00:03:44.050> this<00:03:44.200> is<00:03:44.260> a<00:03:44.320> guitar<00:03:44.470> could<00:03:45.280> be<00:03:45.400> used

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
I think this is a guitar could be used

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.480 
I think this is a guitar could be used
very<00:03:45.760> well<00:03:46.030> for<00:03:46.270> any<00:03:46.420> rock<00:03:47.020> style<00:03:47.400> where<00:03:48.400> they

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
very well for any rock style where they

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:54.710 
very well for any rock style where they
are<00:03:48.640> into<00:03:48.850> blues<00:03:49.120> or<00:03:49.780> more<00:03:50.110> hi<00:03:50.290> Rob

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
bit like a bad one and it gives it a

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.200 
bit like a bad one and it gives it a
retro<00:04:01.020> look<00:04:01.230> that<00:04:01.560> seems<00:04:01.860> a<00:04:01.950> very<00:04:02.400> very<00:04:02.940> cool
