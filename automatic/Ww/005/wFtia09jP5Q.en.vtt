wrong<00:01:40.549> with<00:01:40.609> it<00:01:40.850> because<00:01:40.909> we<00:01:41.119> don't<00:01:41.270> know

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
wrong with it because we don't know

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.959 
wrong with it because we don't know
we're<00:01:41.539> not<00:01:41.630> transmission<00:01:42.229> mechanics<00:01:42.710> but<00:01:42.969> you

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:43.969 
we're not transmission mechanics but you

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:45.999 
we're not transmission mechanics but you
know<00:01:44.119> it's<00:01:44.479> a<00:01:44.630> cheap<00:01:44.840> car<00:01:45.140> for<00:01:45.500> a<00:01:45.530> cheap<00:01:45.770> price

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
know it's a cheap car for a cheap price

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.770 
know it's a cheap car for a cheap price
and<00:01:46.399> it<00:01:46.549> could<00:01:46.700> get<00:01:46.850> you<00:01:47.030> around<00:01:47.240> for<00:01:47.479> a<00:01:47.539> long

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
and it could get you around for a long

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:48.279 
and it could get you around for a long
while

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
while

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:50.179 
and get pretty good gas mileage on the

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:52.149 
and get pretty good gas mileage on the
way<00:01:50.420> so<00:01:50.479> if<00:01:50.780> you<00:01:50.810> need<00:01:51.049> a<00:01:51.079> first<00:01:51.439> car<00:01:51.740> for<00:01:51.770> your

that's<00:02:00.469> why<00:02:00.649> kids<00:02:01.429> are<00:02:01.520> expensive<00:02:02.030> to<00:02:02.119> insure

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
that's why kids are expensive to insure

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.319 
that's why kids are expensive to insure
but<00:02:02.719> you<00:02:03.709> know<00:02:03.829> this<00:02:04.549> could<00:02:04.759> be<00:02:04.909> their<00:02:05.060> first
