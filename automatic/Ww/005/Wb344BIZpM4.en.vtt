what I had said before about the letter
K<00:00:27.830> we<00:00:28.830> only<00:00:28.949> put<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.460> hook<00:00:29.670> at<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.230> end<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.500> the

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
K we only put the hook at the end of the

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.090 
K we only put the hook at the end of the
last<00:00:31.859> stroke<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.180> letter<00:00:33.469> here<00:00:34.469> we<00:00:34.800> didn't

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
last stroke of the letter here we didn't

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.310 
last stroke of the letter here we didn't
do<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.820> first<00:00:36.120> stroke<00:00:36.540> but<00:00:36.719> we<00:00:36.870> did<00:00:37.140> do

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
do it to the first stroke but we did do

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.350 
do it to the first stroke but we did do
it<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.739> second<00:00:38.250> stroke<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.879> letter<00:00:39.120> N

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
it to the second stroke of the letter N

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.610 
it to the second stroke of the letter N
and<00:00:39.899> for<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.920> letter<00:00:41.129> M<00:00:41.399> it's<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.030> same<00:00:42.300> way

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
and for the letter M it's the same way

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:53.420 
and for the letter M it's the same way
the<00:00:43.620> letter<00:00:43.770> M<00:00:43.980> has<00:00:44.309> three<00:00:44.760> legs<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:52.280> it's<00:00:53.280> on

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
the letter M has three legs and it's on

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.470 
the letter M has three legs and it's on
the<00:00:53.610> third<00:00:53.879> leg<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:55.070> we<00:00:56.070> put<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.550> stroke

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
the third leg that we put that stroke

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:13.570 
the third leg that we put that stroke
the<00:00:58.020> hook<00:00:58.730> the<00:00:59.730> letter<00:00:59.940> H

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.060 

it's<00:01:14.210> like<00:01:14.420> the<00:01:14.630> letter<00:01:14.990> n<00:01:15.260> only<00:01:15.740> it<00:01:15.860> has<00:01:16.040> a

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
it's like the letter n only it has a

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:25.929 
it's like the letter n only it has a
taller<00:01:17.110> four-stroke

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:31.120 

and<00:01:26.890> the<00:01:27.890> letter<00:01:28.130> U<00:01:28.579> is<00:01:29.499> like<00:01:30.499> the<00:01:30.679> letter<00:01:30.920> n

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
and the letter U is like the letter n

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.959 
and the letter U is like the letter n
upside<00:01:31.880> down<00:01:33.069> so<00:01:34.069> we'll<00:01:34.250> write<00:01:34.429> these<00:01:34.670> letters

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:34.969 
upside down so we'll write these letters

00:01:34.969 --> 00:02:08.550 
upside down so we'll write these letters
again<00:01:39.490> in<00:01:40.990> H<00:01:41.990> mu

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.240 

and<00:02:08.920> then<00:02:09.850> I'll<00:02:10.000> put<00:02:10.240> this<00:02:10.420> little<00:02:10.810> hat<00:02:11.050> on<00:02:11.410> the

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
and then I'll put this little hat on the

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.150 
and then I'll put this little hat on the
H<00:02:12.459> at<00:02:12.790> as<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:14.110> final<00:02:14.590> touch

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
H at as the final touch

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.610 
H at as the final touch
after<00:02:15.670> I've<00:02:15.790> got<00:02:15.819> the<00:02:16.300> rhythm<00:02:16.510> going<00:02:16.959> on<00:02:17.319> these

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
after I've got the rhythm going on these

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.850 
after I've got the rhythm going on these
other<00:02:18.069> letters<00:02:18.730> I<00:02:19.350> didn't<00:02:20.350> want<00:02:20.500> to<00:02:20.620> interrupt

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
other letters I didn't want to interrupt

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.260 
other letters I didn't want to interrupt
the<00:02:21.900> my<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:23.260> movement<00:02:23.680> of<00:02:23.770> my<00:02:23.920> hand<00:02:24.280> and<00:02:24.819> then

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
the my the movement of my hand and then

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.070 
the my the movement of my hand and then
there's<00:02:25.540> another<00:02:25.720> set<00:02:26.350> for<00:02:27.130> these<00:02:27.310> letters

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
there's another set for these letters

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:35.220 
there's another set for these letters
and<00:02:29.080> it's<00:02:30.069> also<00:02:30.370> a<00:02:30.550> curve<00:02:30.970> in<00:02:31.180> a<00:02:31.270> straight<00:02:34.230> it's

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
and it's also a curve in a straight it's

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.729 
and it's also a curve in a straight it's
one<00:02:35.470> stroke<00:02:35.860> now<00:02:36.190> that's<00:02:36.400> not<00:02:36.670> a<00:02:36.700> C<00:02:37.209> I<00:02:37.540> go<00:02:38.470> back

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
one stroke now that's not a C I go back

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.759 
one stroke now that's not a C I go back
into<00:02:39.130> the<00:02:39.640> hairline<00:02:40.270> at<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:41.290> top<00:02:41.530> where<00:02:41.739> I

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
into the hairline at the top where I

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.900 
into the hairline at the top where I
began<00:02:42.280> and<00:02:43.060> I<00:02:43.930> push<00:02:44.230> over<00:02:44.620> to<00:02:44.769> the<00:02:44.920> right<00:02:45.160> just

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
began and I push over to the right just

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.120 
began and I push over to the right just
a<00:02:46.030> little<00:02:46.269> bit<00:02:46.390> so<00:02:46.480> I'm<00:02:46.600> putting<00:02:46.900> a<00:02:46.989> hat<00:02:47.260> but

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
a little bit so I'm putting a hat but

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.070 
a little bit so I'm putting a hat but
instead<00:02:48.400> of<00:02:48.459> a<00:02:48.580> curved<00:02:48.910> hat<00:02:49.209> like<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.630> F<00:02:49.750> I'm

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
instead of a curved hat like the F I'm

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.030 
instead of a curved hat like the F I'm
it's<00:02:50.260> making<00:02:50.650> it<00:02:50.739> a<00:02:50.800> flat<00:02:51.390> hat<00:02:52.390> and<00:02:52.810> then<00:02:53.620> I'm

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
it's making it a flat hat and then I'm

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.979 
it's making it a flat hat and then I'm
making<00:02:54.220> a<00:02:54.519> Down<00:02:54.760> stroke<00:02:55.950> that<00:02:56.950> is<00:02:57.010> parallel<00:02:57.850> to

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
making a Down stroke that is parallel to

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.630 
making a Down stroke that is parallel to
the<00:02:58.989> other<00:02:59.019> downward<00:02:59.830> strokes<00:03:00.310> in<00:03:00.610> the

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
the other downward strokes in the

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.240 
the other downward strokes in the
letters<00:03:01.630> and<00:03:02.370> that's<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:03.640> letter<00:03:03.850> A<00:03:04.090> and<00:03:05.250> then

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
letters and that's the letter A and then

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.759 
letters and that's the letter A and then
we<00:03:06.519> have<00:03:06.760> a<00:03:07.180> very<00:03:07.840> similar<00:03:08.230> letter<00:03:08.739> to<00:03:08.980> a<00:03:10.769> it's

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
we have a very similar letter to a it's

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:21.720 
we have a very similar letter to a it's
one<00:03:12.040> stroke<00:03:14.190> two

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.199 

so<00:03:22.330> no<00:03:22.739> white<00:03:23.739> off<00:03:23.920> the<00:03:24.099> mark

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
so no white off the mark

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:44.320 
so no white off the mark
we'll<00:03:25.870> do<00:03:25.989> it<00:03:26.019> again<00:03:29.400> one<00:03:31.140> two<00:03:36.180> three

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:56.850 

one<00:03:46.120> two<00:03:49.870> three<00:03:50.980> up<00:03:52.150> four<00:03:53.980> G<00:03:54.980> has<00:03:55.160> four<00:03:55.690> and

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
one two three up four G has four and

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:09.220 
one two three up four G has four and
then<00:04:00.880> one<00:04:03.070> two<00:04:06.280> three<00:04:07.310> and<00:04:07.810> there's<00:04:08.810> the<00:04:09.080> hook

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
then one two three and there's the hook

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.500 
then one two three and there's the hook
the<00:04:09.890> last<00:04:10.480> stroke<00:04:11.480> of<00:04:11.720> the<00:04:11.870> letter<00:04:12.110> has<00:04:12.560> a<00:04:12.590> hook

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
the last stroke of the letter has a hook

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.640 
the last stroke of the letter has a hook
with<00:04:14.510> the<00:04:14.660> G<00:04:14.900> we<00:04:15.200> had<00:04:15.410> we<00:04:15.590> ended<00:04:16.070> it<00:04:17.200> with<00:04:18.200> the<00:04:18.410> G

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
with the G we had we ended it with the G

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:27.130 
with the G we had we ended it with the G
we<00:04:18.859> ended<00:04:19.220> it<00:04:20.410> one<00:04:24.850> so<00:04:25.850> there's<00:04:26.090> the<00:04:26.300> hook<00:04:26.510> but

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
we ended it one so there's the hook but

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.780 
we ended it one so there's the hook but
that<00:04:27.320> looks<00:04:27.560> a<00:04:27.680> little<00:04:27.800> unfinished<00:04:28.100> so<00:04:28.760> I

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
that looks a little unfinished so I

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.470 
that looks a little unfinished so I
added<00:04:29.300> I<00:04:29.420> add<00:04:29.570> like<00:04:29.840> a<00:04:30.070> foot<00:04:31.070> just<00:04:31.850> like<00:04:32.030> the

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
added I add like a foot just like the

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.040 
added I add like a foot just like the
letter<00:04:32.720> J<00:04:33.350> and<00:04:33.820> also<00:04:34.820> the<00:04:34.970> letter<00:04:35.150> P<00:04:35.480> we<00:04:35.870> could

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
letter J and also the letter P we could

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.680 
letter J and also the letter P we could
do<00:04:36.200> that<00:04:36.410> it<00:04:36.890> depends<00:04:37.400> what<00:04:37.580> you<00:04:37.610> like<00:04:37.940> you<00:04:38.240> you

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
do that it depends what you like you you

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.140 
do that it depends what you like you you
can<00:04:38.900> make<00:04:39.080> the<00:04:39.380> form<00:04:39.800> either<00:04:40.070> way<00:04:40.340> and<00:04:40.760> I'll

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
can make the form either way and I'll

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.420 
can make the form either way and I'll
run<00:04:41.390> through<00:04:41.720> all<00:04:42.170> the<00:04:42.560> letters<00:04:42.770> of<00:04:43.130> Group

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
run through all the letters of Group

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.520 
run through all the letters of Group
group<00:04:43.760> to<00:04:44.120> so<00:04:44.390> you<00:04:44.480> can<00:04:44.660> see<00:04:44.900> how<00:04:45.080> they're<00:04:45.290> made

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
group to so you can see how they're made

00:04:45.530 --> 00:06:11.869 
group to so you can see how they're made
again<00:04:46.780> the<00:04:47.780> P

00:06:11.869 --> 00:06:11.879 

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:14.359 

so<00:06:12.839> that's<00:06:13.110> our<00:06:13.349> second<00:06:13.800> group<00:06:13.919> of<00:06:14.159> letters

00:06:14.359 --> 00:06:14.369 
so that's our second group of letters

00:06:14.369 --> 00:06:17.299 
so that's our second group of letters
and<00:06:14.759> we're<00:06:15.209> ready<00:06:15.449> to<00:06:15.779> move<00:06:16.259> on<00:06:16.469> to<00:06:16.709> our<00:06:16.800> third

00:06:17.299 --> 00:06:17.309 
and we're ready to move on to our third

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:19.489 
and we're ready to move on to our third
group<00:06:17.639> of<00:06:17.819> letters<00:06:18.240> which<00:06:18.539> will<00:06:18.779> finish<00:06:19.110> the

00:06:19.489 --> 00:06:19.499
