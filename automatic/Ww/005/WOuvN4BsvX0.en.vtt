going to wish for stealth or throwing

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.029 
going to wish for stealth or throwing
because<00:00:16.020> that<00:00:16.230> actually<00:00:16.289> doesn't<00:00:16.560> factor<00:00:16.800> too

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
because that actually doesn't factor too

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.060 
because that actually doesn't factor too
much<00:00:17.190> into<00:00:17.400> this<00:00:17.960> instead<00:00:18.960> let's<00:00:19.680> see<00:00:19.949> what

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
much into this instead let's see what

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.480 
much into this instead let's see what

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
string should be sufficient let me think

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.339 
string should be sufficient let me think
what<00:00:24.960> am<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.109> doing<00:00:25.140> here<00:00:25.619> um<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:27.349> guess

these<00:00:55.469> skills<00:00:55.739> above<00:00:55.949> 200<00:00:56.430> right<00:00:56.670> at<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.879> end

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
these skills above 200 right at the end

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.670 
these skills above 200 right at the end
you<00:00:57.149> can<00:00:57.270> bring<00:00:57.719> them<00:00:57.840> over<00:00:57.930> 200<00:00:58.289> if<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.440> wish

you can bring them over 200 if you wish

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.130 
you can bring them over 200 if you wish
from<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.399> genie<00:00:59.609> for<00:00:59.789> that<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.719> weapon<00:01:00.899> uses

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
from the genie for that so weapon uses

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.969 
from the genie for that so weapon uses
now<00:01:01.289> 250<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.859> guess<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.250> other<00:01:02.280> thing<00:01:02.520> might<00:01:03.030> be

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
now 250 I guess the other thing might be

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:07.160 
now 250 I guess the other thing might be
I'm<00:01:04.979> not<00:01:05.159> magic<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.820> might<00:01:06.090> i'll<00:01:06.930> probably

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
I'm not magic I might i'll probably

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.899 
I'm not magic I might i'll probably
using<00:01:07.470> some<00:01:07.500> magic<00:01:07.979> pro<00:01:08.189> not<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.549> much<00:01:08.760> so

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
using some magic pro not that much so

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.060 
using some magic pro not that much so
prod<00:01:09.090> doesn't<00:01:09.360> matter<00:01:10.460> else<00:01:11.460> or<00:01:12.180> else<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:13.070> think

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
prod doesn't matter else or else I think

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.990 
prod doesn't matter else or else I think
everything<00:01:14.220> else<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.490> pretty<00:01:14.610> good<00:01:14.729> meal<00:01:14.909> to

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
everything else is pretty good meal to

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.899 
everything else is pretty good meal to
switch<00:01:15.150> for<00:01:15.330> luck<00:01:15.509> I'll<00:01:16.259> back<00:01:16.640> and<00:01:17.640> wish<00:01:17.759> her

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
switch for luck I'll back and wish her

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.749 
switch for luck I'll back and wish her
luck<00:01:17.939> right<00:01:18.360> that's<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.350> good<00:01:19.470> choice<00:01:19.759> yeah

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
luck right that's a good choice yeah

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.840 
luck right that's a good choice yeah
thanks<00:01:21.770> technically<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.860> think<00:01:23.130> luck<00:01:23.700> is

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
thanks technically I think luck is

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:24.800 
thanks technically I think luck is
supposed<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.150> be<00:01:24.210> something<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.479> sleeves

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
supposed to be something that sleeves

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.390 
supposed to be something that sleeves
are<00:01:25.080> supposed<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.439> have<00:01:25.740> high<00:01:26.009> but<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.250> mean

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
are supposed to have high but I mean

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.380 
are supposed to have high but I mean
everything<00:01:26.580> else<00:01:26.790> is<00:01:26.880> pretty<00:01:27.030> good<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.270> think

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
everything else is pretty good I think

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.450 
everything else is pretty good I think
I'm<00:01:27.570> pretty<00:01:27.630> prepared<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.409> deal<00:01:29.189> with<00:01:29.369> the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
I'm pretty prepared to deal with the

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.770 
I'm pretty prepared to deal with the
ending<00:01:29.729> as<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.240> I'll<00:01:30.329> go<00:01:30.420> ahead<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.630> do

ending as it is so I'll go ahead and do

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.350 
ending as it is so I'll go ahead and do
that<00:01:31.640> ok<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:32.700> I'm<00:01:32.820> going<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:32.970> go<00:01:33.090> ahead<00:01:33.150> and
