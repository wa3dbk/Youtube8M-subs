00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 
it's good to do short fast strokes when

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.570 
it's good to do short fast strokes when
you're<00:06:47.080> actually<00:06:47.560> in<00:06:47.710> the<00:06:47.740> thick<00:06:48.370> of<00:06:48.490> the

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:48.580

you're actually in the thick of the
eyebrow<00:06:48.970> but<00:06:49.240> once<00:06:49.390> you<00:06:49.480> get<00:06:49.600> to<00:06:49.660> the<00:06:49.870> end

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.050 
eyebrow but once you get to the end

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.460

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:52.470 
we're extending the eyebrow to do long

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:55.920 
we're extending the eyebrow to do long
even<00:06:53.470> strokes<00:06:53.970> don't<00:06:54.970> do<00:06:55.240> like<00:06:55.510> the<00:06:55.690> quick

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:55.930

strokes<00:06:56.260> on<00:06:56.440> the<00:06:56.560> end<00:06:56.710> because<00:06:57.040> otherwise

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:57.250 
strokes on the end because otherwise

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:03.029 
strokes on the end because otherwise
it'll<00:06:57.580> look<00:06:57.670> choppy

00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:03.039 

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:06.070 

and<00:07:04.039> I<00:07:04.490> just<00:07:04.669> blend<00:07:04.939> in<00:07:05.180> the<00:07:05.449> front<00:07:05.810> with<00:07:06.050> the
