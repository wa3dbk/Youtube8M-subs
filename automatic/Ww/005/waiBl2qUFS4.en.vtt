this<00:02:02.549> one<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:02.850> actually<00:02:03.030> stiffer<00:02:03.630> which<00:02:04.530> means

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
this one is actually stiffer which means

this one is actually stiffer which means
better<00:02:04.890> quality<00:02:04.979> this<00:02:05.610> one<00:02:05.790> is<00:02:05.939> just<00:02:06.180> loose

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
better quality this one is just loose

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.779 
better quality this one is just loose
