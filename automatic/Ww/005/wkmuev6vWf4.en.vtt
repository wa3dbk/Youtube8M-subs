00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.069
 ben voila good I'll make you a 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.800
 little by little technical brief on this 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:11.440
 panigale since we are talking about frames 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.089
 shell all that good bah ducati we have 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.940
 brought pieces so I start with 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:18.880
 the superquadro so down everyone the 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.560
 know pretty much it's a 90 ° v-twin 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.030
 with both coming on the same bench 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.990
 tuna so what can we see 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:27.400
 here we can see the clutch since 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.920
 the crankshaft ex is pretty much 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.829
 here this brooch home so it drives 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.380
 a primary transmission that goes from the 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.210
 crankshaft silk at the clutch 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.040
 there is a gear down here you 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.020
 see we see a kind of big crankcase 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.910
 then there is the water pump 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.570
 besides we see the hoses that 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.430
 leave and come we also have a 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.590
 funny thing that I nicknamed the 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.730
 sardine box is an exchanger at 8 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.200
 it replaces an oil radiator 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.360
 takes up less space it's more efficient 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.430
 so here's the oil circulating and 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.620
 the water is obviously in disturbed 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.479
 separate finally separate ducts and that 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.250
 allows a better homogeneity of the 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.680
 oil temperature and water good 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.720
 we see the admissions here elliptical 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.260
 so a priori according to ducati it's 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.570
 the equivalent of 62 mm in diameter and 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.450
 then here we obviously see the 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.740
 two overhead cams la la which 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.850
 operates the four valves 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:29.170
 if we go around the engine here there is 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.909
 the electricity there is the alternator 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.290
 week is pretty massive 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.430
 it's a bike that has a lot 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.470
 electronics so it takes internet 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.299
 hours that come out a lot of watts so 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.580
 the alternator and then here at a 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.860
 mixed distribution chain and sprockets 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.600
 with the vending machines we 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.540
 see here and that obviously like his 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.340
 and cross and on the other side there is 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.130
 the selector and there we at the secondary APs 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.900
 out of box so that's basically this 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.909
 engine then this engine and the carriers 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.740
 why then I will try to you 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:02.259
 show here is the famous ducati hull 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.920
 so here we have the air in between 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.070
 there we see here the kz2 the column of 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.539
 direction 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:17.180
 and I will show you how it is 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:18.709
 shows then I put my microphone here is the 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.300
 system so that we can consider that 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.510
 it's the front frame that comes to fix 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.820
 on the cylinder heads of the two-cylinder 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.230
 here we have the air filter and here we have 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.900
 air intake 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.000
 so here and then the ducati she is 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:41.360
 quite simple since the other part 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:42.680
 this trifle in play rests micro that 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.660
 he comes to fix on the casings 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.239
 engine so on a wide shot you can 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.160
 to see that a wholesale panigale is that 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.489
 that's what makes the frame of the sentence 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.489
 to go 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.470
 the front part the two-cylinder she beats 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.459
 also back so that's it for 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.290
 it's a light motorcycle because 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.580
 that she is she is very simple and then 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.600
 the pieces are aluminum see this 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:08.720
 weighs it weighs nothing and lastly the 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:10.070
 reservoir that it rises above this 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.090
 the box r I do not know if I'm going 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.090
 succeed I try it 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.010
 it's not great but it gives you a 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.110
 idea of ​​the machine so voila and the 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.610
 secrets of panigale I tell you to 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.379
 soon for another session 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.379
 the technique while having fun
