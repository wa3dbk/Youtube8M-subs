 hello to all this back for a new 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.259
 tutorial and today I show you 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.700
 how to use pastels so we 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.620
 start right away with the material 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.440
 first of all you will need pastel 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.480
 listening to oil meals beware of 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.460
 different types of brush to be able to 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.080
 apply it with a polish spray maths 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.119
 or in fixative personally I 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.730
 prefer the varnish but it's like you 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.560
 want a hair customize it so 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.109
 me there is a white base because there 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.609
 pastel is going to be its base color there and 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.619
 a pair of scissors 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.480
 you also need a 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.130
 container of a leaf for power 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.750
 put your pastel or so everything 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.579
 just hold her in the small 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.500
 container to start so we go 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.290
 come take care our reception that 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.670
 to store your pastel or so a 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.890
 sheet with me I opted for the 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.270
 sheet because to him but whose 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.120
 containers that not the one that 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.120
 I use more then another pair 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.370
 of scissors our horse to customize and 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.500
 different types of brush so me 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.809
 I have three types of brushes there for 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.329
 to use pastel an ambrosia that has 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.080
 daddy trading hairs this is the ingredient the 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.570
 same but in finer for nooks 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.310
 custom is in board everything was so 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.250
 there will be good for a stopover or to 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.920
 end that I'll show we're going next 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.380
 take our pastel assortment of 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.600
 think guyot brand I do not know 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.470
 so his assortments his double 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.650
 as you can see the beauty 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.210
 smashed to buy it on in a 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.680
 Catalog no school supplies 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.329
 do not know if for you will be able 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.009
 find but in any case there is not bad 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.479
 of colors and there all the talent that 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.909
 you play against these pastels that 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.369
 I bought more culture and 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.409
 mark paris county so there I go 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.460
 use in black beige paris county 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.189
 for what this volume 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.140
 so that's going to be the base color of 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.020
 my horse we will come and take our 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.600
 scissors open it and it's all simple 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.049
 just going to come rub the blade against the 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.790
 watermelon to make a powder but 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.649
 wanted it really is very simple with 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.549
 oil pastels will not get there 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.740
 that's why I thought 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.299
 sects or extend knowing he's me 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.750
 seems that the tender marks more than 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.160
 the essec 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.470
 so that's what we get so a 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.610
 little powder that we are going to come so 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.650
 applied his other horse 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.210
 so here I teach you my patient 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.400
 to breuil what is I find the 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.940
 practice of what I have I will come 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.250
 soaked the brush in quotation marks in 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.260
 the bass tel and so I'm going to spread it 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.790
 on my horse by making little ones 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.220
 movements as if I had gone from the 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.000
 painting simply 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.110
 aja then a little bit because I want that 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.270
 as it is a light color it is necessary 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.980
 that the samare broken but when we want 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.350
 make black shades especially need 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.060
 pay close attention to the intensity 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.590
 support because otherwise it marks 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.430
 very much 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.620
 then I will take my brush 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.750
 bushy and that was pretty important there 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.400
 have to go overboard for 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.620
 remove the surplus of not that which can 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.380
 get stuck in the box for example 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.970
 because if not if you want if you 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.470
 do not do that will make pies of which 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.970
 the screen and where it's really me I 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.290
 think of just as much but the three 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.239
 quarters of the time that you advise not to 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.100
 not avoid these steps 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.630
 then will have this come to start 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.010
 outside on a platform that does not 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.540
 fear nothing and we will take our 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.360
 fixative varnish we will simply 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.570
 pulverized our horse so on all the 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.330
 body 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.680
 it will help to fix the watermelon 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.180
 so that she does not move this step 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.250
 is really important can not 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.890
 forget it is obligatory because 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.230
 otherwise the pastel of the draw m so I 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.060
 not filming end so I'm going to you
