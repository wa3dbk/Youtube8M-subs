00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
gonna just guess that shop owners have

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.630 
gonna just guess that shop owners have
just<00:00:33.899> been<00:00:34.020> busting<00:00:34.440> these<00:00:34.559> out<00:00:34.739> so<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.520> they

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
just been busting these out so that they

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.190 
just been busting these out so that they
could<00:00:35.820> find<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.180> rarities<00:00:36.540> they<00:00:36.660> can<00:00:36.840> try<00:00:37.020> and

could find the rarities they can try and

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.080 
could find the rarities they can try and
you<00:00:37.559> know<00:00:37.710> set<00:00:37.980> like<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.129> preliminary<00:00:38.489> market

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
you know set like a preliminary market

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.240 
you know set like a preliminary market
if<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.629> had<00:00:39.750> these<00:00:39.899> cards<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.410> definitely<00:00:41.100> put

if I had these cards I definitely put

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.619 
if I had these cards I definitely put
them<00:00:41.370> on<00:00:41.430> eBay<00:00:41.670> because<00:00:41.940> I'm<00:00:42.329> kind<00:00:42.570> of

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
them on eBay because I'm kind of

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.490 
them on eBay because I'm kind of
creating<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.140> market<00:00:43.500> anyways<00:00:43.980> looks<00:00:44.940> like

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
creating the market anyways looks like

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.220 
creating the market anyways looks like
why<00:00:46.500> do<00:00:46.559> your<00:00:46.770> organization<00:00:47.370> has<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:48.329> full<00:00:48.930> list

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
why do your organization has a full list

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.040 
why do your organization has a full list
of<00:00:49.440> all<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.070> rarities<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.579> see<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:51.020> well<00:00:52.020> I

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
of all the rarities you see that well I

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.990 
of all the rarities you see that well I
guess<00:00:52.350> they're<00:00:52.500> missing<00:00:52.890> one<00:00:52.920> ultra<00:00:53.610> rare<00:00:53.820> and

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
guess they're missing one ultra rare and

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.610 
guess they're missing one ultra rare and
a<00:00:54.480> couple<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.960> super<00:00:55.260> rares

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
a couple of super rares

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.619

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
but just in general it looks like we

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.330 
but just in general it looks like we
pretty<00:00:57.750> much<00:00:57.870> know<00:00:58.260> what<00:00:58.620> all<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.949> rarities

either the top or bottom of your deck
okay<00:03:29.209> so<00:03:29.799> honestly<00:03:30.799> I'm<00:03:31.099> sure<00:03:31.340> that<00:03:31.549> there's

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
okay so honestly I'm sure that there's

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.309 
okay so honestly I'm sure that there's
something<00:03:32.030> out<00:03:32.329> there<00:03:32.389> like<00:03:32.930> this<00:03:33.079> I<00:03:33.290> just

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
something out there like this I just

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:36.069 
something out there like this I just
can't<00:03:33.739> think<00:03:34.040> of<00:03:34.280> it<00:03:34.459> at<00:03:34.819> the<00:03:34.970> time<00:03:35.150> something

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
can't think of it at the time something

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.440 
can't think of it at the time something
that<00:03:36.109> that<00:03:36.650> does<00:03:36.920> both<00:03:37.340> attack<00:03:37.790> and<00:03:37.819> defense

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
that that does both attack and defense

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.390 
that that does both attack and defense
because<00:03:38.750> if<00:03:39.079> I'm<00:03:39.410> just<00:03:39.650> looking<00:03:39.889> at<00:03:40.010> attack

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
because if I'm just looking at attack

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.670 
because if I'm just looking at attack
versus<00:03:40.880> attack<00:03:41.209> like<00:03:41.540> you<00:03:42.230> have<00:03:42.380> a<00:03:42.410> Valkyrie

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
versus attack like you have a Valkyrie

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.960 
versus attack like you have a Valkyrie
and<00:03:43.190> I<00:03:43.250> have<00:03:43.459> a<00:03:44.530> Deneb<00:03:45.530> and<00:03:45.950> you<00:03:46.849> know

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
and I have a Deneb and you know

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.770 
and I have a Deneb and you know
basically<00:03:47.660> like<00:03:48.230> my<00:03:48.470> Deneb<00:03:49.010> would<00:03:49.280> gain<00:03:49.780> 2900

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
basically like my Deneb would gain 2900

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.789 
basically like my Deneb would gain 2900
attack<00:03:50.870> plus<00:03:51.530> 100<00:03:52.130> so<00:03:52.340> 3000<00:03:53.090> attack<00:03:53.769> or<00:03:54.769> you

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
attack plus 100 so 3000 attack or you

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:57.129 
attack plus 100 so 3000 attack or you
know<00:03:55.310> what<00:03:55.459> no<00:03:55.579> no<00:03:55.700> I<00:03:55.730> think<00:03:55.849> it<00:03:56.180> um<00:03:56.299> it<00:03:56.630> becomes

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:57.139 
know what no no I think it um it becomes

00:03:57.139 --> 00:03:59.140 
know what no no I think it um it becomes
that<00:03:57.440> yep<00:03:57.799> yep<00:03:57.980> sorry<00:03:58.370> yeah<00:03:58.639> I<00:03:58.669> don't<00:03:58.849> gain

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
that yep yep sorry yeah I don't gain

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.059 
that yep yep sorry yeah I don't gain
it's<00:03:59.419> not<00:03:59.569> honest<00:03:59.900> but<00:04:00.260> yeah<00:04:00.410> so<00:04:00.590> my<00:04:00.709> attack

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
it's not honest but yeah so my attack

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:03.699 
it's not honest but yeah so my attack
becomes<00:04:01.519> your<00:04:01.910> vows<00:04:02.150> attack<00:04:02.780> your<00:04:03.200> your<00:04:03.530> vows

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
becomes your vows attack your your vows

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.550 
becomes your vows attack your your vows
attack<00:04:04.160> being<00:04:04.370> 2,900<00:04:05.180> and<00:04:05.329> then<00:04:05.840> my<00:04:06.049> guy<00:04:06.260> gains

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
attack being 2,900 and then my guy gains

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.680 
attack being 2,900 and then my guy gains
an<00:04:06.769> additional<00:04:07.010> 100<00:04:07.730> that<00:04:07.940> that<00:04:08.329> kind<00:04:08.569> of

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
an additional 100 that that kind of

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.629 
an additional 100 that that kind of
reminds<00:04:09.079> me<00:04:09.139> of<00:04:09.260> prideful<00:04:09.829> roar<00:04:10.010> essentially

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:10.639 
reminds me of prideful roar essentially

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:13.210 
reminds me of prideful roar essentially
that<00:04:11.120> card<00:04:11.389> I<00:04:11.690> think<00:04:11.720> you<00:04:12.019> gain<00:04:12.230> 300<00:04:12.739> over

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
that card I think you gain 300 over

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.069 
that card I think you gain 300 over
their<00:04:13.579> attack<00:04:13.940> but<00:04:14.480> I<00:04:14.510> can't<00:04:14.750> think<00:04:14.959> of

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
their attack but I can't think of

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:18.190 
their attack but I can't think of
anything<00:04:15.319> where<00:04:16.250> it<00:04:16.760> does<00:04:17.120> defense<00:04:17.570> to<00:04:17.900> so

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
anything where it does defense to so

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.629 
anything where it does defense to so
like<00:04:18.380> let's<00:04:18.650> say<00:04:18.769> your<00:04:18.919> opponent<00:04:19.160> has<00:04:19.459> like<00:04:19.609> a

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
like let's say your opponent has like a

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:22.959 
like let's say your opponent has like a
shaky<00:04:20.090> Naga<00:04:20.299> then<00:04:21.229> in<00:04:21.890> defense<00:04:22.430> mode<00:04:22.520> and<00:04:22.669> you

00:04:22.959 --> 00:04:22.969 
shaky Naga then in defense mode and you

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:23.980 
shaky Naga then in defense mode and you
have<00:04:23.120> a<00:04:23.150> Deneb

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
have a Deneb

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.809 
have a Deneb
you<00:04:24.169> literally<00:04:24.530> can<00:04:24.830> run<00:04:25.099> over<00:04:25.220> chicken<00:04:25.520> Naga

00:04:25.809 --> 00:04:25.819 
you literally can run over chicken Naga

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:29.320 
you literally can run over chicken Naga
because<00:04:26.330> your<00:04:27.169> attack<00:04:27.830> will<00:04:28.099> become<00:04:28.400> 3,000

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
because your attack will become 3,000

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.390 
because your attack will become 3,000
your<00:04:29.509> attack<00:04:29.780> will<00:04:29.900> become<00:04:30.169> her<00:04:30.410> defense<00:04:30.830> but

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
your attack will become her defense but

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.820 
your attack will become her defense but
you<00:04:31.550> gain<00:04:31.729> that<00:04:31.910> extra<00:04:32.060> 100<00:04:32.840> so<00:04:33.080> your<00:04:33.560> attack

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
you gain that extra 100 so your attack

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.249 
you gain that extra 100 so your attack
actually<00:04:34.039> becomes<00:04:34.430> 3100<00:04:35.180> so<00:04:35.300> this<00:04:35.750> car<00:04:35.990> does

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:36.259 
actually becomes 3100 so this car does

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:39.010 
actually becomes 3100 so this car does
have<00:04:36.470> a<00:04:36.860> lot<00:04:37.160> of<00:04:37.190> utility<00:04:37.849> and<00:04:38.090> it<00:04:38.569> works<00:04:38.810> if

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
have a lot of utility and it works if

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.080 
have a lot of utility and it works if
you<00:04:39.590> just<00:04:39.770> want<00:04:40.009> to<00:04:40.069> like<00:04:40.280> chill<00:04:40.580> in<00:04:40.789> defense

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
you just want to like chill in defense

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.680 
you just want to like chill in defense
to<00:04:42.160> your<00:04:43.160> opponent<00:04:43.849> just<00:04:43.880> can't<00:04:44.270> attack<00:04:44.539> like

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
to your opponent just can't attack like

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.390 
to your opponent just can't attack like
if<00:04:44.810> your<00:04:44.960> opponent<00:04:45.410> has<00:04:45.440> like<00:04:45.650> a<00:04:45.680> stove<00:04:46.039> and

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
if your opponent has like a stove and

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.140 
if your opponent has like a stove and
it's<00:04:47.330> like<00:04:48.229> 3100<00:04:49.220> because<00:04:49.460> it's<00:04:49.639> pumped<00:04:50.030> up

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
it's like 3100 because it's pumped up

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.180 
it's like 3100 because it's pumped up
with<00:04:50.330> like<00:04:50.599> a<00:04:51.020> carrier<00:04:51.500> or<00:04:51.620> something<00:04:51.949> and<00:04:52.099> you

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
with like a carrier or something and you

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.520 
with like a carrier or something and you
have<00:04:52.220> like<00:04:52.639> a<00:04:53.090> chicken<00:04:53.810> egg<00:04:53.960> in<00:04:54.110> defense<00:04:54.470> mode

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
have like a chicken egg in defense mode

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.469 
have like a chicken egg in defense mode
if<00:04:54.800> you<00:04:54.949> play<00:04:55.130> this<00:04:55.250> on<00:04:55.430> chicken<00:04:55.729> Naga<00:04:55.940> your

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
if you play this on chicken Naga your

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:59.080 
if you play this on chicken Naga your
defense<00:04:56.990> will<00:04:57.560> become<00:04:57.919> their<00:04:58.580> attack

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
defense will become their attack

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.610 
defense will become their attack
whatever<00:04:59.389> is<00:04:59.659> the<00:04:59.810> highest<00:05:00.110> so<00:05:00.229> it<00:05:00.319> kind<00:05:00.530> of

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
whatever is the highest so it kind of

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.559 
whatever is the highest so it kind of
makes<00:05:00.800> your<00:05:00.979> monsters<00:05:01.490> for<00:05:02.030> the<00:05:02.120> most<00:05:02.300> part

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:02.569 
makes your monsters for the most part

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:04.270 
makes your monsters for the most part
pretty<00:05:02.810> much<00:05:03.050> immune<00:05:03.440> to<00:05:03.680> dying<00:05:03.919> in<00:05:04.130> battle

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
pretty much immune to dying in battle

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.800 
pretty much immune to dying in battle
like<00:05:04.610> I<00:05:04.699> just<00:05:04.909> don't<00:05:05.120> see<00:05:05.330> a<00:05:05.360> way<00:05:05.509> that<00:05:05.720> that's

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
like I just don't see a way that that's

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.899 
like I just don't see a way that that's
gonna<00:05:06.020> happen<00:05:06.470> and<00:05:06.620> then<00:05:07.069> you<00:05:07.190> always<00:05:07.430> get<00:05:07.729> the

00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:07.909 
gonna happen and then you always get the

we<00:06:35.330> can<00:06:35.479> search<00:06:35.750> them<00:06:35.960> but<00:06:36.110> does

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680 
we can search them but does

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.170 
we can search them but does
this<00:06:36.770> card<00:06:37.009> really<00:06:37.340> do<00:06:37.520> enough<00:06:37.850> to<00:06:38.030> where

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180 
this card really do enough to where

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.520 
this card really do enough to where
you'd<00:06:38.419> want<00:06:38.449> to<00:06:38.630> play<00:06:38.750> something<00:06:39.080> like<00:06:39.289> hidden

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:39.530 
you'd want to play something like hidden

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:40.689 
you'd want to play something like hidden
Armory<00:06:39.889> like<00:06:40.039> I<00:06:40.130> don't<00:06:40.190> think<00:06:40.370> so

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:40.699 
Armory like I don't think so

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:42.790 
Armory like I don't think so
now<00:06:41.150> one<00:06:41.300> good<00:06:41.509> thing<00:06:41.539> about<00:06:41.930> this<00:06:42.259> is<00:06:42.440> the

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 
now one good thing about this is the

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.100 
now one good thing about this is the
fact<00:06:43.070> that<00:06:43.190> the<00:06:43.430> the<00:06:44.030> attack<00:06:44.360> or<00:06:44.630> defense

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.110 
fact that the the attack or defense

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.840 
fact that the the attack or defense
gained<00:06:45.440> only<00:06:45.949> works<00:06:46.160> in<00:06:46.370> the<00:06:46.400> damage

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:46.850 
gained only works in the damage

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:48.760 
gained only works in the damage
calculation<00:06:47.389> means<00:06:48.050> that<00:06:48.229> you<00:06:48.350> can't<00:06:48.680> be

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:48.770 
calculation means that you can't be

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.070 
calculation means that you can't be
blasted<00:06:49.370> with<00:06:49.400> Ragna<00:06:49.970> zero<00:06:50.240> so<00:06:50.840> that's

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.080 
blasted with Ragna zero so that's

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.090 
blasted with Ragna zero so that's
actually<00:06:51.289> really<00:06:51.470> good<00:06:51.650> if<00:06:51.830> it<00:06:51.919> was<00:06:52.039> like

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:52.100 
actually really good if it was like

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.379 
actually really good if it was like
during<00:06:52.430> the<00:06:52.550> battle<00:06:52.880> phase<00:06:53.030> or<00:06:53.270> something

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:53.389 
during the battle phase or something

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:54.670 
during the battle phase or something
like<00:06:53.630> when<00:06:53.780> your<00:06:53.900> opponent<00:06:54.259> declares<00:06:54.560> an

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:54.680 
like when your opponent declares an

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.529 
like when your opponent declares an
attack<00:06:54.949> gain<00:06:55.190> it<00:06:55.370> then<00:06:55.520> your<00:06:56.090> opponent<00:06:56.210> can

00:06:56.529 --> 00:06:56.539 
attack gain it then your opponent can

00:06:56.539 --> 00:06:58.060 
attack gain it then your opponent can
make<00:06:56.690> like<00:06:56.840> ragna<00:06:57.229> zero<00:06:57.410> and<00:06:57.710> it<00:06:57.770> could<00:06:57.919> blow

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:58.070 
make like ragna zero and it could blow

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:59.499 
make like ragna zero and it could blow
it<00:06:58.100> up<00:06:58.280> but<00:06:58.460> it's<00:06:58.580> only<00:06:58.820> during<00:06:59.120> damage

00:06:59.499 --> 00:06:59.509 
it up but it's only during damage

00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:01.150 
it up but it's only during damage
calculation<00:06:59.690> obviously<00:07:00.650> writing<00:07:00.919> the<00:07:00.979> zero

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:01.160 
calculation obviously writing the zero

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.010 
calculation obviously writing the zero
can't<00:07:01.400> activate<00:07:01.880> and<00:07:02.030> damage<00:07:02.270> calculation<00:07:02.449> so

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:03.020 
can't activate and damage calculation so

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.290 
can't activate and damage calculation so
this<00:07:03.620> is<00:07:03.770> a<00:07:03.800> really<00:07:04.100> good<00:07:04.220> card<00:07:04.520> it's<00:07:04.880> just

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:05.300 
this is a really good card it's just

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.510 
this is a really good card it's just
you're<00:07:06.259> gonna<00:07:06.470> have<00:07:06.710> to<00:07:06.830> find<00:07:07.070> a<00:07:07.340> way<00:07:07.490> to

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:07.520 
you're gonna have to find a way to

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.879 
you're gonna have to find a way to
exploit<00:07:08.240> it<00:07:08.449> and<00:07:08.570> my<00:07:08.780> personal<00:07:09.229> opinion<00:07:09.620> like
