00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.540
 you know that I too when twitter what will happen 

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:13.889
 because I was doing this conservation at some point told me 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.650
 how is it possible 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.739
 the century of art 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:20.739
 that 

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:23.740
 and all in all bullshit they are all stupid 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.390
 the critical artists in merchant collectors all jerks 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:31.640
 gf 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.640
 because at some point 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.810
 if you want to say 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.100
 probable why not 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.030
 that's bullshit 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.350
 contemporary art is so true that it never has any discounts 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.040
 than then the market 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.330
 both 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.330
 full of morons is probable 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.890
 However 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.220
 within this market 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.850
 the aesthetic function that should be peculiar to art 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.700
 is replaced 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.340
 in the case of intelligent people from a function that you then enjoy power 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.970
 and cody 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.890
 in reality 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.420
 very often works of art are even used for purposes 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.790
 different if he knew 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.810
 sign in talks to someone who 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.899
 understand finance rather than 3d very often works of art come 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:24.870
 He took 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.920
 put as collateral in the bank on the basis of this collateral bank give the 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.810
 money with this money is perhaps bought the oil of the feedings 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:33.660
 weapons 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.280
 then killa to give birth to a value around a pan with paint 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.270
 over it 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.950
 I carry any object of relative cost 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.620
 because an extraordinary market value is born, it produces a very dense that 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.620
 financially determines prompt availability of a 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:50.840
 of cash 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.070
 from the bank that anticipates you having this cash collateral 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.820
 which serve remarked so it's true 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.410
 that 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.160
 let's say the men in the art world like that 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.530
 they believe they are wines as if to say it makes blind veils 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.400
 the press - letter that the salary they take is there is between that though 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.569
 basically they know it is true 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.370
 it is also true that by force parodi deny them themselves become idiots 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:21.169
 but the great minds in the art world 

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:25.729
 they are clever they are not idiots i am these they are there i do i 

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:27.139
 fiocchetti then over 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:28.469
 the idiocy of the people 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:31.899
 crime is always the deficiency 

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:34.449
 and stupidity 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:39.239
 help &amp; are engines in the night economy the economy works for example if 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.669
 there were no thieves there would be no need for a window 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:48.069
 shattering if he were not there is a little boy who believes in love when a 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.150
 16 years there would be no whole market for advertising done in a certain 

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:54.589
 way of music precedes us 

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:59.009
 idiocy stupidity blindness is the market because when a person 

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:03.139
 smart and green sis going to look for things on its own is not a market 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:04.709
 it is not consumer 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:05.619
 somewhere 

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:07.509
 eh ak com 

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:12.089
 current account procurer seeks peace to build then consume cells 

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:15.769
 himself builds and evolves maybe for others he is producer of 

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:18.919
 of advantage for the others does not go 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:21.969
 to stick to the nipple of society 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:25.489
 but he himself becomes a woman of the Turin province
