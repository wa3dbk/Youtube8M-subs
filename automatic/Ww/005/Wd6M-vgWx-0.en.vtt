00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.200 
button I ordered two of them they were
very<00:00:19.160> inexpensive<00:00:20.160> I<00:00:20.430> think<00:00:20.670> like<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:20.970> dollar

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
very inexpensive I think like a dollar

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.029 
very inexpensive I think like a dollar
fifty<00:00:21.600> nine<00:00:21.779> or<00:00:22.020> something<00:00:22.320> like<00:00:22.439> that<00:00:22.650> and

fifty nine or something like that and

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.950 
fifty nine or something like that and
they<00:00:23.550> came<00:00:23.789> with<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.269> button<00:00:24.570> itself<00:00:24.930> and

they came with the button itself and

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.640 
they came with the button itself and
they<00:00:27.960> screw<00:00:28.260> on<00:00:28.289> nut<00:00:28.650> so<00:00:28.890> you<00:00:28.980> would<00:00:29.099> put<00:00:29.279> that

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
they screw on nut so you would put that

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.069 
they screw on nut so you would put that
you'd<00:00:31.650> mount<00:00:31.920> this<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.690> plywood<00:00:33.690> or

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
you'd mount this to the plywood or

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.150 
you'd mount this to the plywood or
whatever<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.530> then<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:34.649> tighten<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.100> down

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
whatever and then you tighten it down

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.500 
whatever and then you tighten it down
with<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.030> then<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.899> also<00:00:37.140> came<00:00:37.530> with<00:00:37.559> a

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
with this and then it also came with a

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.470 
with this and then it also came with a
micro<00:00:39.510> switch<00:00:40.070> which<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:41.910> thing<00:00:42.239> and

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
micro switch which is this thing and

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.920 
micro switch which is this thing and
that's<00:00:42.750> what<00:00:43.020> actually<00:00:43.820> triggers<00:00:44.930> the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
that's what actually triggers the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.889 
that's what actually triggers the
command<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:47.910> when<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.329> have<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.600> all<00:00:48.719> put

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
command so when you have it all put

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.580 
command so when you have it all put
together<00:00:50.120> it<00:00:51.120> fits<00:00:51.420> on<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.750> bottom<00:00:52.110> like<00:00:52.320> this

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
together it fits on the bottom like this

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.350 
together it fits on the bottom like this
so<00:00:53.309> then<00:00:53.699> when<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.030> push<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.570> button<00:00:56.300> get<00:00:57.300> a

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
so then when you push the button get a

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.729 
so then when you push the button get a
nice<00:00:57.539> little<00:00:57.780> clicky<00:00:58.760> clicky<00:00:59.760> sound<00:00:59.789> um<00:01:00.590> it<00:01:01.590> is
