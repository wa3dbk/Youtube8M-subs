 the 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.320
 the 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:19.239
 the 

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:22.239
 the 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.310
 the 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.540
 the the style 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.540
 3 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.760
 in this blog.nl video promotion we take the texelse with the bee and we go to the 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.290
 hit with pretty much the most popular a lobster for these questions the ball virtus 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.290
 point 4 feels engine conversion 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.660
 and for that you need the dewalt fetish can be a promoter like this 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.740
 used by the walt in 2004 for cordless cordless drills to play the ball 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:09.540
 partner 3 9 6 5 Nov pronounces 2 sv and can be obtained at any hardware store with the 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.760
 rocks blocked 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.650
 costs around 30 euros 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.210
 the bar motors a hefty also called 800 scythe 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.190
 a cross section diameter of 47 and a length of 67 millimeters 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.620
 as you can see, a size larger than the standard from a 7 7 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.620
 5 motor of plexus on the right 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.590
 But why is this engine popular among the server during the first reason 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.020
 The browsers are dust cloud brushes 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.320
 This is not the case with the standard motor chest or worn out 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.310
 means a new motor co both the ball or you can proto the chest 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.380
 simply replace it with a new one 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.450
 a second reason the baltic got a full time snack was a good deal 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.670
 than the standard motor there is not afraid of what about voltage he can be fine 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.310
 run at 4 cents level 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.500
 and for a call brush motor it offers incredible how much torque and torque 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.789
 that means super pulling power match with 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.789
 but also the possibility of using a somewhat higher combustion 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.010
 The third reason the 2004 ball engine is trouble-free to use with the 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.029
 standard judges even x2 the regulator of the cement 

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:16.379
 the gent broad sense 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:17.969
 and a few put the bus 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:20.969
 therefore still 100 percent watertight 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:22.880
 a thingy 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.640
 Hundreds of point 4 motor whales with which you have to get to the 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.539
 bin 

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:31.529
 the engine came home agreed in debate tools and so there is for this 

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:35.779
 Purpose standard is a motor gear on a clamped anti to precisely 

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:40.349
 and a down for us but the property ratio or this tastes that 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.209
 must therefore be taken off 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.720
 and for that a remo is needed 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.210
 with such a perilous all sporting with karting disco 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:51.619
 don't forget to completely cover the engine so that it is flying around 

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:54.619
 metal particles cannot enter the engine through the opening 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:56.769
 there we go 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.459
 piece of motor as bring because he missed flat piece before the startled 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.739
 the new motorcycle champion 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.930
 after breaking one with a screwdriver and half the property 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:06.590
 kilos 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.590
 our path is too strong for the stable screws to look good 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.049
 and with the other half off, we now have a very useful one 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.049
 5 millimeter motor as with a flat no 

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:22.329
 rather a nice storage not yet because this is the standard engine month of 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.359
 the cement 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:29.439
 and as you see the free for the engine error one on the engine line there is not good 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:32.439
 out with a month they stand a little further apart 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:37.879
 you get on your dremel and for that big opening 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.969
 and at a good time as the engine but because it is great on the tire engine 

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:55.009
 the user, incidentally, longer motor boats and 4 by 16 millimeters long 

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.829
 to be precise 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.829
 to hold the heavy debate engine firmly in place 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.610
 because these errors have a convex headline 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.570
 we have transferred a small notch in the church with the demon so that 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.600
 when the debate engine is placed the case closes nicely 

00:04:11.029 --> 00:04:13.939
 then you have to recommend the the beam motor equipped with motor for the connection 

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:18.379
 with the regulator the motor wires sun directly again on our chest and this one 

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:21.379
 you can easily remove it with a flat shoe 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.229
 the teaser for easy with this again the threads of the standard time a 7 7 5 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:30.560
 they with motor and soldering are directly on the brushes of it 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.580
 new the ball twice can motor here 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.580
 pay close attention to the poles that time of the brushes 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.340
 and when you are done, it looks good 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.770
 well brushes with wire back in the motor and so you see him also the capacitor 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.229
 transferred from original motor with good polarity again 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:54.860
 brussel the breast on the roll indirectly on the motor housing 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.250
 the commission had to be there if and to remove radio interference from the brushes 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.009
 lifting 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:03.210
 just a bit flat on the engine as smoothly auctioned 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.139
 controller closed for a quick test 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.139
 and before we build it in, there is still time for it 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.600
 brush since leads one 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.479
 in the wet way as you see 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:17.240
 the so-called huet stone effect ensures that the call brushes work great on the 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.770
 commentator in wear 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.630
 for maximum electrical contract 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.879
 and therefore maximum torque and speed 

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:27.879
 After embedding, dry the engine thoroughly and possibly with an electric motor 

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:30.479
 deal with and build in that trade 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:34.550
 Here you can see the 14-point 4-volt engine with the standard Kevin X2 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.039
 controller in our texts summit 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:41.270
 we're going to ride on four sets that are up with 18 62 showing 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:57.589
 so no difference wins on speed this is the second gear and you still get 

00:05:57.589 --> 00:06:00.580
 always around 30 to 35 kilometers per hour 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.650
 to speak process terms 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.639
 the ball twitter can have around twelve hundred bars here 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:07.469
 twelve hundred farmers 

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:10.540
 lower than the standard engine but with higher combustion 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.800
 so net about the same speed 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.639
 the game with a fixed weather full full 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:19.029
 and like viruses with 4 0 2 

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.840
 makes sense 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.969
 failed to build for speed 

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:25.699
 for climbing 

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:27.280
 plow through the forest lanes 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.480
 and always others to all those other doctors who cannot drive cars 

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:32.680
 at a slow pace 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.779
 with maximum control over face official bearing opened 

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:38.889
 with particularly high torque 

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:41.949
 and there, a percent excels whether or not to be motorbikes 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:45.020
 0 striking control 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.520
 and there, this film excels at setting four engines while twittering 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.520
 read the light up enormously 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.110
 that the waltrip the gable is particularly powerful or of course none 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:57.240
 to be a surprise 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.090
 the moto comes from a whole series, it is a strong quality tool 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:02.409
 of the country 

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:05.570
 and that there is therefore a course of a motor drilling machine 

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:09.850
 this, of course, only benefits the five soloists just as waterproof 

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.409
 as the standard 

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:15.360
 we hope this video will bring you closer 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.740
