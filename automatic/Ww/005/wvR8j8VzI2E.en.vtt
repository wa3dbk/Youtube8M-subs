this is intended to give the device
allow<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.310> device<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.700> absorb<00:01:21.360> more<00:01:21.570> light<00:01:21.840> up

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
allow the device to absorb more light up

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.480 
allow the device to absorb more light up
to<00:01:22.290> three<00:01:22.530> times<00:01:22.560> more<00:01:22.890> light<00:01:23.189> when<00:01:23.369> it's

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
to three times more light when it's

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.340 
to three times more light when it's
taking<00:01:23.759> pictures<00:01:24.090> really<00:01:24.930> helps<00:01:25.259> in
