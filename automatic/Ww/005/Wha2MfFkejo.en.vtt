 No excuse for tcu information 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:44.759
 here is the 64-bit system type 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:47.460
 you saw your booty 64-bit good is 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.439
 speaking in 86 but from the beginning and 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.380
 means that it is 32 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.009
 if I am 32, just open one of these 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.200
 two 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.110
 good now it depends on what windows you 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.329
 had been prointer proid 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.909
 give you a couple of clicks on this 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.040

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.979
 small 64-bit and will not give 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.720
