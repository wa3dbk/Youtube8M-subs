00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.850
 the bus and the rail 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.370
 in the square of the station 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.010
 rail a bus expected the 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.040
 passengers who were to arrive on the train 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.060
 from nine o'clock in the morning 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.950
 this arrived with all the punctuality and 

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:22.820
 during the minutes when the train 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:25.610
 he waited for him to get out and the 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:29.419
 bus was receiving the passengers and 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.100
 their luggage both started this 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.320
 conversation 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.990
 dear bus 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:40.590
 you do what you want 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:43.890
 can circulate with full freedom more 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.980
 where also of that one so much to turn 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.080
 to the left or to the right nothing nor 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.470
 nobody prevents you 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:55.660
 you are really free how lucky 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:58.120
 you have me instead 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.390
 I am always subject to these avenues of 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.120
 diary that unfortunately mine if I tried 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.110
 get out of these rails that mark 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.840
 inexorably my way 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.930
 how much reason do you have old friend 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.560
 railway 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:18.320
 I can choose my route and change it 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.970
 how many times do you want it 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.110
 you can discover new places 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:27.470
 unsuspected horizons even if I 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:31.910
 I want half I have one in a meadow 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:34.280
 green and rest for a while while the 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:37.960
 occupants take their to our 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.420
 it's true but not everything is so pretty 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:44.409
 you know the amount of danger to 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:47.070
 that I am exposed to every moment I must 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:50.619
 walk eyevisor in every step I take 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.470
 the other vehicles assault me ​​by all 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:57.430
 sides to and from me if I get distracted 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:00.700
 second and if I get off the road and 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:04.509
 if not to pace too much to the gutter and if 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:08.869
 the car in front of me dazzles 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:12.819
 catastrophe can be monumental 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:17.620
 and it's true it's not going to happen to me 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:20.230
 my submission to the road reduces freedom 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.530
 but it increases my security 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.260
 I can move kilometers and kilometers 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:30.220
 with my eyes closed and I can reach 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:33.240
 sleep speeds whenever I do not 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:37.410
 leave my beloved kings 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:41.940
 I do not own my itinerary address 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:45.410
 I am marked by others and changes in 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:49.520
 Needles solve the crossroads 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.980
 that could make me doubt 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:56.260
 yes old 3 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:03:00.700
 it happens to us as to the people you know 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:04.870
 to more freedom plus greater risks 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:08.860
 dangers more responsibility to the 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:12.099
 decisions is very beautiful to be free but 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:16.190
 it is also very difficult the price that there is 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:19.850
 that paying for freedom is very high 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:23.300
 but it's worth the dialogue was 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.060
 interrupted by the whistle of the head of 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.840
 the station 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.959
 that gave the exit to the express 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.720
 Madrid Barcelona 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:36.340
 at the same time someone inside the taxi 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.900
 I was asking for sweetener 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.900
 where are we going to pass
