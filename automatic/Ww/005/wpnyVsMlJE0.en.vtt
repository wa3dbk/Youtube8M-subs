00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:50.310 
thought today we performed really well

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.830 
thought today we performed really well
and<00:00:50.580> with<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.700> better<00:00:50.880> side<00:00:51.120> overall<00:00:51.510> it's<00:00:51.810> not

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
and with a better side overall it's not

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.450 
and with a better side overall it's not
me<00:00:52.020> played<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.380> heir<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:52.950> great<00:00:53.190> pitch

me played the heir to this great pitch
and<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:54.420> think<00:00:55.080> all<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.290> girls<00:00:55.470> were<00:00:55.590> really

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:55.830 
and I think all the girls were really

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.130 
and I think all the girls were really
wasn't<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.190> were<00:00:56.310> playing<00:00:56.610> on<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.879> but

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
wasn't that were playing on it but

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.570 
wasn't that were playing on it but

overall it was good too just gonna get a

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.760 
overall it was good too just gonna get a
win<00:00:59.760> I<00:01:00.000> think<00:01:00.600> especially<00:01:00.960> one<00:01:01.350> me<00:01:01.440> no<00:01:01.620> but<00:01:01.739> a

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.680 
win I think especially one me no but a
Sunday<00:01:02.220> and<00:01:02.370> like<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:03.000> try<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.300> get<00:01:03.420> there<00:01:03.540> as

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690

Sunday and like to try and get there as
quick<00:01:03.840> as<00:01:03.870> he<00:01:03.989> possibly<00:01:04.140> can<00:01:04.440> were<00:01:04.619> with<00:01:04.830> them

you're<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.820> team<00:01:06.000> members<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.680> but<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.710> think

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
you're the team members and but I think

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.170 
you're the team members and but I think
you<00:01:08.190> kind<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.460> have<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.670> put<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.910> to<00:01:09.000> one<00:01:09.119> side

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
you kind of have to put it to one side

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.700 
you kind of have to put it to one side
that<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.660> play<00:01:09.840> for<00:01:09.990> different<00:01:10.080> clubs<00:01:10.500> and

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
that you play for different clubs and

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.109 
that you play for different clubs and
now<00:01:10.830> as<00:01:11.070> soon<00:01:11.220> as<00:01:11.310> we<00:01:11.430> get<00:01:11.550> in<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.760> car<00:01:11.940> were

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
now as soon as we get in the car were

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.700 
now as soon as we get in the car were
kind<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.360> running<00:01:12.479> lungi<00:01:12.899> we<00:01:13.020> then<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.380> think

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
kind of running lungi we then I think

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.219 
kind of running lungi we then I think
off<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.860> pitch<00:01:14.190> with<00:01:14.490> before<00:01:14.960> got<00:01:15.960> off<00:01:16.050> maybe

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
off the pitch with before got off maybe

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.070 
off the pitch with before got off maybe
well<00:01:16.500> they're<00:01:16.979> kinda<00:01:17.880> had<00:01:18.030> lots<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.390> different

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
well they're kinda had lots of different

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.930 
well they're kinda had lots of different
lengths<00:01:19.259> asks<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.009> stuff<00:01:20.220> going<00:01:20.460> on<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:20.820> when

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
lengths asks and stuff going on so when

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.820 
lengths asks and stuff going on so when
women<00:01:21.210> say<00:01:21.360> for<00:01:21.570> example<00:01:22.110> would<00:01:22.200> up<00:01:22.350> like<00:01:22.560> your

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
women say for example would up like your

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.790 
women say for example would up like your
girl<00:01:23.160> kind<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.119> coffee<00:01:24.330> club<00:01:24.690> and<00:01:25.259> stuff<00:01:25.590> so

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
girl kind of coffee club and stuff so

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.680 
girl kind of coffee club and stuff so
that<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.250> girls<00:01:26.460> are<00:01:26.640> more<00:01:26.729> relaxed<00:01:27.090> then<00:01:27.479> I

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
that the girls are more relaxed then I

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.330 
that the girls are more relaxed then I

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
think you'd see that in our performance

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.400 
think you'd see that in our performance
on<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.910> the<00:01:30.000> pitch<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.390> say<00:01:30.570> you've<00:01:31.080> enjoyed
