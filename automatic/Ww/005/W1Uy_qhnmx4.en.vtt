00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
a really shiny granola which is really

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.160 
a really shiny granola which is really
appealing<00:02:39.769> and<00:02:40.209> then<00:02:41.209> you<00:02:41.720> have<00:02:41.840> a<00:02:41.870> little<00:02:42.050> bit

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
appealing and then you have a little bit

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.479 
appealing and then you have a little bit
of<00:02:42.290> brown<00:02:42.470> sugar<00:02:42.500> that<00:02:42.950> gives<00:02:43.130> it<00:02:43.280> a<00:02:43.340> little

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
of brown sugar that gives it a little

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.330 
of brown sugar that gives it a little
bit<00:02:43.640> of<00:02:43.850> that<00:02:43.970> molasses<00:02:44.600> flavor<00:02:44.810> and<00:02:45.170> then<00:02:45.950> um

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
bit of that molasses flavor and then um

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.370 
bit of that molasses flavor and then um
that<00:02:46.940> goes<00:02:47.180> really<00:02:47.420> well<00:02:47.720> I<00:02:47.750> think<00:02:47.959> with<00:02:48.350> the

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
that goes really well I think with the

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.120 
that goes really well I think with the
with<00:02:48.890> that<00:02:49.900> toasted<00:02:50.900> coconut<00:02:51.380> or<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.739> coconut

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
with that toasted coconut or the coconut

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.410 
with that toasted coconut or the coconut
and<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.340> coconut<00:02:52.700> really<00:02:52.880> gives<00:02:53.150> us<00:02:53.239> this

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
and the coconut really gives us this

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.440 
and the coconut really gives us this
really<00:02:53.570> nice<00:02:54.440> kind<00:02:54.739> of<00:02:54.910> fragrant<00:02:55.910> to<00:02:56.030> perfume

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
really nice kind of fragrant to perfume

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.720 
really nice kind of fragrant to perfume

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
substitute is from vanilla instead and I

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.400
