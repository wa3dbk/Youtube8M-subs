00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.510 
story
everything<00:01:12.689> they<00:01:12.869> learn<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:13.409> through<00:01:14.310> the

everything they learn is through the

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.910 
everything they learn is through the
walk<00:01:14.760> pretty<00:01:15.479> much<00:01:15.780> like<00:01:16.080> wolves<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.740> they're

all<00:01:17.070> descended<00:01:17.670> from<00:01:17.700> wolves<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:19.170> Wolves

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
all descended from wolves so the Wolves

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.640 
all descended from wolves so the Wolves
understood<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.670> we<00:01:21.060> follow<00:01:22.049> them<00:01:22.380> leader
