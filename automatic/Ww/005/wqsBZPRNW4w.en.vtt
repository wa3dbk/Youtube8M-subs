00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
amplified is really powerful and as you

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.040 
amplified is really powerful and as you
saw<00:04:23.660> I<00:04:23.930> was<00:04:24.320> just<00:04:24.620> holding<00:04:25.070> it<00:04:25.370> from<00:04:25.610> the<00:04:25.699> hip

probably<00:04:27.050> thinking<00:04:27.530> I<00:04:27.650> had<00:04:27.949> steady<00:04:28.400> aim<00:04:28.580> on

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
probably thinking I had steady aim on

instead of extreme condition which and

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.590 
instead of extreme condition which and
steady<00:04:34.190> aim<00:04:34.400> is<00:04:34.520> probably<00:04:34.940> better<00:04:35.180> for<00:04:35.330> me

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
steady aim is probably better for me

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.330 
steady aim is probably better for me
because<00:04:35.630> I<00:04:36.729> usually<00:04:37.729> don't<00:04:37.910> like<00:04:38.540> to<00:04:38.570> run
