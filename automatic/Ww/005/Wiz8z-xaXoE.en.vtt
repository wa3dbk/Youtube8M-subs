00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:09.690
 very well today we will paint our nails 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.690
 and we will add sugar in this case 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:21.770
 very well first we will proceed to choose 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:24.520
 the colors to paint our nails 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.520
 I will choose 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.710
 this one light blue together with a yellow 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.870
 purple 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.870
 and the car 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:47.870
 let's first the layer is minced 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.870
 protective which we already have applied 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.330
 first we paint 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.759
 then we add the sugar 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:15.799
 once 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.430
 and we squeeze 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.580
 so that it is well fixed to the painting 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.000
 and then add another color 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.729
 and we add others 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:54.000
 It can also be done with salt that is 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.000
 make it thin 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.420
 or how we do it here with 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.420
 sugar 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.980
 when yellow, let's let it dry 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.980
 to apply the other layer 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.689
 now 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.200
 let's apply 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:07.020
 and now something heavenly is better so 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.020
 let's apply the sugar 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.090
 and again we press 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.310
 now we will go 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:28.950
 for him 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:36.190
 with the next color 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:39.150
 in pink red 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.150
 the idea 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.690
 to the colors that you want at 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.350
 paint 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.960
 if you want to paint a color 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.960
 they do it 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:56.060
 if not painted as Balearics 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.060
 and again we will apply sugar 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:15.920
 very well and so are these signs then 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:19.600
 it simply applies 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.600
 when dry it is applied 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.970
 today 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.800
 a little glaze 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:31.680
 brightness 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.680
 so that it stays well fixed to the nail 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.770
 and it is fixed 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:45.139
 so that it is 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.139
 and the sugar does not come out
