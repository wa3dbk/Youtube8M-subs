00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.570

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.089
 hello to all we are on monday 12

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.059

 digital things that announces a date the 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.870
 September 10 is this day that 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:40.670
 would be chosen by apple to present 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.069
 the new iphone called for the moment 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.379
 five aces and that would be an evolution of 

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:47.569
 the current iphone 5 apple could also 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.640
 present iphone 5 is a version 

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:51.409
 cheaper and could between him 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.569
 a model with many colors and 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:55.460
 finally if the site of young digital does not 

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:57.469
 not deceive it's also that day that 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.539
 would come out the final version of the ios is 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.159
 with a design that still does not 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:04.010
 unanimously among all those who have it 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:05.750
 tested we have already registered on the 10th 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.310
 September in our agenda and we 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.200
 will be at the listened ready to make you a 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.260
 debrief the next day deal to 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.260
 to follow 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.760
 if you have trouble falling asleep 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.860
 or if you want to work with 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.080
 original musical background you can 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.630
 now listen to wikipedia and heat 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.100
 the experimental site listen wikipedia 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.540
 offers you to listen to each 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.580
 modification made on the site 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.050
 wikipedia color shape of a note 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.490
 musical what gives you a symphony 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.800
 nice enough to listen to 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.990
 so the intensity of each note varies 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.850
 according to the importance of the modification and 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.440
 the sound that is played depends on its nature 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.780
 a bell sound represents a 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.860
 information that has been added to the article 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.150
 while in two bodies are 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.080
 represents that a deletion of a 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.060
 part of an article 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.860
 if this kind of original experiments 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.630
 you are interested know that you can 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.580
 also listen to all 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.950
 bitcoin network transactions on the 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.260
 network bitlis home.com and on a theme 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.060
 a little different you listening to you 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.920
 invites to listen to radio frequencies 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.960
 the american police but the nights 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.939
 electronic plane eric everything is 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.799
 possible if with that you can not get 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.850
 to be zen in front of your computer he will 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:14.480
 have to think about taking a vacation 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:15.770
 assure you it's a good nycb 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.239
 could be just another 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.430
 mobile application dedicated to creation 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.290
 videos of short duration but she has 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.910
 been founded by two developers in the 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.380
 first start-up is a little bit 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.670
 known as youtube 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.160
 it must surely remind you 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.540
 thing so when chad hurley steve 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.120
 chen introduce their new baby 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.650
 we listen to them necessarily so mixbeat is 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.110
 an application that strongly resembles 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.730
 at valves or video instagram and takes a 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.860
 direction a little bit special 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.000
 since if she authorizes to film that 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.769
 16 seconds of video 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.299
 it allows, on the other hand, to create 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.190
 montages using videos 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.410
 other members of mixbeat communities 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.660
 to design real movies a 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.480
 maximum duration of 68 minutes for a little 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.360
 more than one hour which corresponds to 256 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.470
 16-second video put end-to-end 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.239
 menix bits can also create 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.140
 montages of the same scene seen under 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.700
 different angles 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.830
 what would be useful for example for 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.150
 to film a concert mixbeat is available on 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.620
 iphone and android 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.209
 the app is free so much 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.410
 try and tell us what you 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.880
 think 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.109
 the question of the day comes from banana 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.459
 mouth of who is all happy with his 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:15.109
 iphone 5 but who cares a little 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.940
 because he did not install any antivirus 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:18.620
 smoke they ask us so what in 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.730
 are the risks and well shabana nagl 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.980
 Congratulations for your nickname 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.900
 Congratulations for your question and congratulations for your 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.519
 fidelity in full summer know that the 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.900
 risks of using an iphone 5 without 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.250
 antiviruses are very weak 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.079
 indeed the applications that are 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.390
 displayed on the app store are validated 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.980
 one by one per click and moderation and 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.570
 are subject to antiviruses of course 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.920
 which is not the case on android 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.420
 since it is natively possible 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.850
 to install apps even if they do not 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.680
 not come from the google pay store and 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.940
 even on google pay apps do not 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.230
 are not subject to the same rules 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.510
 strict app store 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.579
 but if your iphone is jailbroken 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.290
 it's a lot more dangerous since 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.030
 is then possible to install 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.920
 apps without going through the app store but 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.780
 rather by parallel stores which 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.730
 significantly increases the risk of 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.319
 fall on supports vered whose 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.269
 the origin do not take to be controlled 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.500
 shameful therefore strongly advises against 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.579
 fresh railroads it's over for 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.810
 today we meet again tomorrow 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:07.810
 hi to all and have a good day
