mainly because i did one a few weeks ago

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.470 
mainly because i did one a few weeks ago
and<00:00:10.349> it<00:00:10.620> wasn't<00:00:10.920> very<00:00:11.070> good<00:00:11.219> plus<00:00:11.940> i<00:00:12.150> only<00:00:12.360> got

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
and it wasn't very good plus i only got

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.230 
and it wasn't very good plus i only got
in<00:00:12.630> them<00:00:12.780> in<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.590> mail<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:13.889> few<00:00:14.130> hours<00:00:14.670> ago<00:00:14.790> at

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
in them in the mail a few hours ago at

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.800 
in them in the mail a few hours ago at
that<00:00:15.570> time<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:16.199> an<00:00:17.070> even<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.789> few<00:00:18.119> times<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.720> I

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
that time and an even a few times and I

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.109 
that time and an even a few times and I
didn't<00:00:19.080> really<00:00:19.520> know<00:00:20.520> what<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:20.789> was<00:00:20.880> talking

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
didn't really know what I was talking

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.120 
didn't really know what I was talking
about<00:00:21.300> so<00:00:21.449> I've<00:00:22.170> written<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.740> quite<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.039> lot

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
about so I've written it quite a lot

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.009 
about so I've written it quite a lot
after<00:00:24.060> that<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.630> here<00:00:25.260> i<00:00:25.289> am<00:00:25.439> so<00:00:27.019> dimensions

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
after that and here i am so dimensions

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.999 
after that and here i am so dimensions
and<00:00:28.349> stuff<00:00:28.710> like<00:00:28.859> that<00:00:29.029> 34<00:00:30.029> inches<00:00:30.449> long<00:00:31.009> with

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
and stuff like that 34 inches long with

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.610 
and stuff like that 34 inches long with
eight<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.880> half<00:00:32.910> inches<00:00:33.420> wide<00:00:34.140> at<00:00:34.559> the

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
eight and a half inches wide at the

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.520 
eight and a half inches wide at the
widest<00:00:35.130> point<00:00:35.399> which<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.579> about<00:00:35.850> their

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
widest point which is about their

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.600 
widest point which is about their
roughly<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:38.899> i<00:00:39.899> think<00:00:40.410> it's<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.770> 30<00:00:41.370> inch

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
roughly and i think it's a 30 inch

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.810 
roughly and i think it's a 30 inch
wheelbase<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.629> might<00:00:42.840> be<00:00:42.989> 28<00:00:43.530> might<00:00:43.829> be<00:00:43.980> 31<00:00:44.550> i'm

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
wheelbase it might be 28 might be 31 i'm

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.850 
wheelbase it might be 28 might be 31 i'm
really<00:00:45.420> not<00:00:45.539> sure<00:00:45.600> but<00:00:45.960> that's<00:00:46.140> about<00:00:46.530> what<00:00:46.739> it

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
really not sure but that's about what it

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.660 
really not sure but that's about what it
looks<00:00:47.039> like<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:49.910> khon<00:00:50.910> kaen<00:00:51.170> um<00:00:52.610> not<00:00:53.610> much

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
looks like so khon kaen um not much

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.880 
looks like so khon kaen um not much
camber<00:00:54.600> i<00:00:54.960> think<00:00:55.289> it's<00:00:55.379> called<00:00:55.440> oh<00:00:57.440> no<00:00:58.440> no<00:00:58.590> it's

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
camber i think it's called oh no no it's

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.099 
camber i think it's called oh no no it's
actually<00:00:58.980> quite<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.370> lot<00:00:59.550> in<00:00:59.789> mind<00:01:00.180> it's<00:01:00.870> quite

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
actually quite a lot in mind it's quite

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.340 
actually quite a lot in mind it's quite
a<00:01:01.170> lot<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.350> camber<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:04.309> not<00:01:05.309> much<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:06.350> little

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
a lot of camber and not much a little

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.429 
a lot of camber and not much a little
bit<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.280> concave<00:01:08.670> but<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.600> know<00:01:09.750> it's<00:01:10.110> enough

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
bit of concave but you know it's enough

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.990 
bit of concave but you know it's enough
it<00:01:10.860> works<00:01:11.369> quite<00:01:11.670> well<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:13.070> design<00:01:14.070> its<00:01:14.430> top

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
it works quite well so design its top

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.060 
it works quite well so design its top
mounted<00:01:15.420> as<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.900> can<00:01:16.049> see<00:01:19.880> symmetrical<00:01:20.880> no

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
mounted as you can see symmetrical no

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.090 
mounted as you can see symmetrical no
it's<00:01:23.070> wider<00:01:23.700> at<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:23.939> top<00:01:24.060> which<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:25.100> don't

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
it's wider at the top which is I don't

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.800 
it's wider at the top which is I don't
know<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.250> doesn't<00:01:26.580> really<00:01:26.700> matter<00:01:26.909> at<00:01:27.299> all<00:01:27.360> it

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
know it doesn't really matter at all it

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.749 
know it doesn't really matter at all it
looks<00:01:28.049> cool<00:01:29.000> so<00:01:30.000> this<00:01:30.630> comes<00:01:30.930> standard<00:01:31.799> with

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:40.190 

Paris<00:01:35.759> 150<00:01:36.689> millimeter<00:01:37.170> trucks<00:01:38.630> with<00:01:39.630> divine

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
Paris 150 millimeter trucks with divine

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.859 
Paris 150 millimeter trucks with divine
90a<00:01:40.829> bushings<00:01:41.490> which<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.060> like<00:01:42.270> standard

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
90a bushings which is like standard

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.100 
90a bushings which is like standard
bushings<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.409> think<00:01:43.619> I'm<00:01:44.579> just<00:01:44.869> cone<00:01:45.869> and

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
bushings I think I'm just cone and

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.539 
bushings I think I'm just cone and
barrel<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:47.399> don't<00:01:47.610> see<00:01:48.049> or<00:01:49.049> not<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.549> then

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
barrel you don't see or not and then

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.330 
barrel you don't see or not and then
it's<00:01:50.850> got<00:01:51.090> divine<00:01:52.049> road<00:01:52.439> what<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.829> 70

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
it's got divine road what is 70

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.340 
it's got divine road what is 70
millimeters<00:01:53.909> now<00:01:54.240> these<00:01:54.689> are<00:01:54.930> supposed<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.290> be

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
millimeters now these are supposed to be

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.530 
millimeters now these are supposed to be
yellow<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.490> like<00:01:56.640> all<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.969> pictures<00:01:57.390> on

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
yellow and like all the pictures on

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.840 
yellow and like all the pictures on
their<00:01:57.689> website<00:01:58.110> but<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.070> know<00:01:59.189> color<00:01:59.610> of

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
their website but you know color of

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.749 
their website but you know color of
wheel<00:02:00.180> may<00:02:00.540> vary<00:02:00.990> all<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.680> stuff<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:02.579> they

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
wheel may vary all that stuff so they

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.530 
wheel may vary all that stuff so they
gave<00:02:02.939> me<00:02:03.180> green<00:02:03.509> ones<00:02:03.750> which<00:02:04.740> are<00:02:04.979> 78a<00:02:05.850> which<00:02:06.360> i

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
gave me green ones which are 78a which i

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.979 
gave me green ones which are 78a which i
think<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.869> better<00:02:07.079> but<00:02:07.469> you<00:02:08.250> know<00:02:08.720> anyway<00:02:09.720> and

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
think is better but you know anyway and

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.180 
think is better but you know anyway and
those<00:02:10.229> are<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.619> bit<00:02:11.009> five<00:02:11.640> bearings

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
those are a bit five bearings

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.430 
those are a bit five bearings
so<00:02:13.430> they<00:02:13.550> spin<00:02:13.880> for<00:02:14.090> quite<00:02:14.300> a<00:02:14.330> while<00:02:14.540> and<00:02:14.600> roll

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
so they spin for quite a while and roll

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.220 
so they spin for quite a while and roll
pretty<00:02:15.920> well<00:02:17.140> so<00:02:18.140> that's<00:02:18.770> that<00:02:19.480> then<00:02:20.480> I<00:02:20.870> think

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
pretty well so that's that then I think

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.110 
pretty well so that's that then I think
it's<00:02:21.410> an<00:02:21.590> ace<00:02:21.830> of<00:02:22.040> eighth<00:02:22.310> of<00:02:22.550> an<00:02:22.670> inch<00:02:22.760> riser

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
it's an ace of eighth of an inch riser

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.240 
it's an ace of eighth of an inch riser
pad<00:02:23.450> but<00:02:23.780> I'm<00:02:23.870> not<00:02:24.020> sure<00:02:24.050> anyway<00:02:24.800> matter<00:02:25.690> so

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
pad but I'm not sure anyway matter so

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.770 
pad but I'm not sure anyway matter so
this<00:02:28.250> has<00:02:28.670> got<00:02:28.970> heaps<00:02:29.630> of<00:02:29.900> flex<00:02:31.060> I'm<00:02:32.060> bouncing

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
this has got heaps of flex I'm bouncing

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.630
