bone you can see a preview of it and

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.780 
bone you can see a preview of it and
that's<00:04:25.230> what<00:04:25.350> it<00:04:25.530> looks<00:04:25.680> like<00:04:25.800> now<00:04:26.100> I'm<00:04:26.640> going

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
that's what it looks like now I'm going

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.610 
that's what it looks like now I'm going
to<00:04:26.850> set<00:04:26.970> this<00:04:27.090> as<00:04:27.300> my<00:04:27.600> background<00:04:27.870> just<00:04:28.500> show

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
to set this as my background just show

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.460 
to set this as my background just show
you<00:04:28.680> it<00:04:28.890> big<00:04:29.390> screen<00:04:30.390> this<00:04:30.750> won't<00:04:30.960> fit<00:04:31.290> exactly

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
you it big screen this won't fit exactly

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.220 
you it big screen this won't fit exactly
because<00:04:31.830> I<00:04:31.950> did<00:04:32.070> not<00:04:32.100> do<00:04:32.550> the<00:04:32.790> screen<00:04:33.780> size

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
because I did not do the screen size

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.670 
because I did not do the screen size
measurements<00:04:34.950> I<00:04:35.130> think<00:04:35.730> so<00:04:36.690> it<00:04:36.840> won't<00:04:37.050> fit<00:04:37.440> is

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
measurements I think so it won't fit is

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.990 
measurements I think so it won't fit is
likely<00:04:38.220> perfectly<00:04:39.140> so<00:04:40.140> then<00:04:40.320> go<00:04:40.470> to<00:04:40.760> they<00:04:41.760> can

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
likely perfectly so then go to they can

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.750 
likely perfectly so then go to they can
make<00:04:42.450> click<00:04:42.870> the<00:04:43.080> little<00:04:43.260> plus<00:04:43.350> button<00:04:43.760> and

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
make click the little plus button and

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.270 
make click the little plus button and
then<00:04:45.000> you<00:04:45.060> can<00:04:45.210> click<00:04:45.360> that<00:04:45.600> and<00:04:46.250> they<00:04:47.250> go

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
then you can click that and they go

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.160 
then you can click that and they go
there<00:04:47.730> is<00:04:47.910> the<00:04:48.120> effect<00:04:48.420> it<00:04:48.660> wouldn't<00:04:48.990> normally

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
there is the effect it wouldn't normally

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.760 
there is the effect it wouldn't normally
be<00:04:49.380> that<00:04:49.650> blurry<00:04:49.950> it's<00:04:50.520> because<00:04:51.180> he'll<00:04:51.900> fit<00:04:52.620> to

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
be that blurry it's because he'll fit to

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.370 
be that blurry it's because he'll fit to
screen<00:04:53.270> it's<00:04:54.270> because<00:04:54.600> I<00:04:54.750> did<00:04:54.930> it<00:04:55.050> smaller

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
screen it's because I did it smaller

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.350 
screen it's because I did it smaller
then<00:04:55.800> it<00:04:55.920> should<00:04:56.040> actually<00:04:56.190> be<00:04:56.460> but<00:04:57.060> there<00:04:57.270> you

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
then it should actually be but there you

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.750 
then it should actually be but there you
go<00:04:57.390> guys<00:04:57.990> that<00:04:58.410> is<00:04:58.590> the<00:04:58.800> effects<00:04:59.100> that<00:04:59.340> is<00:04:59.610> how
