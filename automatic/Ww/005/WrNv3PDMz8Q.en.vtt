this particular type of form you have

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.190 
this particular type of form you have
the<00:01:07.789> ends<00:01:08.149> which<00:01:08.329> also<00:01:08.600> locked<00:01:09.020> together

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
the ends which also locked together

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.959 
the ends which also locked together
everything<00:01:09.770> interlocks<00:01:10.310> nice<00:01:10.579> and<00:01:10.789> tight

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:10.969 
everything interlocks nice and tight

little wise we put it in a nice angle

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.830 
little wise we put it in a nice angle
like<00:01:26.450> that

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
like that

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.090

Macca<00:01:27.939> about<00:01:28.939> a<00:01:28.969> 40<00:01:29.659> degree<00:01:29.749> angle<00:01:29.929> and<00:01:30.829> just

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
Macca about a 40 degree angle and just

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.709 
Macca about a 40 degree angle and just
push<00:01:31.459> it<00:01:31.579> down<00:01:31.609> as<00:01:31.939> he<00:01:32.060> laying<00:01:32.240> it<00:01:32.389> down<00:01:32.420> if<00:01:32.689> you

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:32.719 
push it down as he laying it down if you

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:35.440 
push it down as he laying it down if you
can<00:01:32.899> see<00:01:33.079> this<00:01:33.289> gap<00:01:33.530> is<00:01:33.829> opening<00:01:33.979> up<00:01:34.459> I'd<00:01:35.209> get

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
can see this gap is opening up I'd get

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.440 
can see this gap is opening up I'd get
more<00:01:36.139> pressure<00:01:36.530> on<00:01:36.709> it<00:01:38.950> that's<00:01:40.209> good<00:01:41.209> isn't<00:01:41.359> it

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
more pressure on it that's good isn't it

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.410 
more pressure on it that's good isn't it
can<00:01:41.719> you<00:01:41.929> see<00:01:42.170> that<00:01:42.350> also<00:01:43.340> on<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:43.880> edges<00:01:44.209> here

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
can you see that also on the edges here

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.969 
can you see that also on the edges here
a<00:01:44.569> lot<00:01:44.719> of<00:01:44.749> times<00:01:44.840> they<00:01:45.049> get<00:01:45.200> a<00:01:45.259> little<00:01:45.409> torn<00:01:45.770> up

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
a lot of times they get a little torn up

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:47.769 
a lot of times they get a little torn up
well<00:01:46.520> like<00:01:46.759> this<00:01:46.880> one<00:01:47.060> here<00:01:47.209> make<00:01:47.539> sure<00:01:47.569> you

00:01:47.769 --> 00:01:47.779 
well like this one here make sure you

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:49.809 
well like this one here make sure you
pull<00:01:48.020> that<00:01:48.139> piece<00:01:48.380> out<00:01:48.590> as<00:01:48.889> otherwise<00:01:49.130> when

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:49.819 
pull that piece out as otherwise when

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:51.580 
pull that piece out as otherwise when
you<00:01:49.880> start<00:01:50.090> putting<00:01:50.270> more<00:01:50.810> flooring<00:01:51.319> on<00:01:51.439> it

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
you start putting more flooring on it

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.199 
you start putting more flooring on it
that<00:01:51.889> little<00:01:52.189> piece<00:01:52.399> right<00:01:52.520> there<00:01:52.670> would<00:01:53.060> give

00:01:53.199 --> 00:01:53.209 
that little piece right there would give

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:55.300 
that little piece right there would give
you<00:01:53.329> such<00:01:53.600> a<00:01:53.630> headache<00:01:53.959> make<00:01:54.740> sure<00:01:54.859> that<00:01:55.039> felt

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310

hey okay a big deal we can use tape
measure<00:02:05.060> figure<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.240> out<00:02:06.450> it'll<00:02:06.810> take<00:02:06.990> times

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.230 
measure figure it out it'll take times

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.940 
measure figure it out it'll take times
you<00:02:07.470> got<00:02:07.620> a<00:02:07.650> lot<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.040> the<00:02:08.310> do<00:02:09.020> you<00:02:10.020> see<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.380> is

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
you got a lot of the do you see it is

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.640 
you got a lot of the do you see it is
much<00:02:11.520> too<00:02:11.790> far<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.660> way<00:02:12.840> I<00:02:12.870> like<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:13.290> real

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
much too far the way I like it real

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.520 
much too far the way I like it real
simple<00:02:13.830> some<00:02:14.490> easy<00:02:14.900> turning<00:02:15.900> around<00:02:15.990> them<00:02:16.290> I

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
simple some easy turning around them I

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.610 
simple some easy turning around them I
have<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.460> DNA<00:02:18.150> normally<00:02:18.960> point<00:02:19.260> this<00:02:19.380> way

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
have the DNA normally point this way

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.310 
have the DNA normally point this way
which<00:02:19.860> is<00:02:19.950> blocking<00:02:20.160> I<00:02:20.580> put<00:02:21.120> them<00:02:21.330> put<00:02:21.690> it

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
which is blocking I put them put it

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.130 
which is blocking I put them put it
against<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.680> wall<00:02:23.390> look<00:02:24.390> right<00:02:24.600> here<00:02:24.900> keep

the other edge of the flooring make a
nice<00:02:27.900> mark<00:02:28.700> so<00:02:29.700> now<00:02:29.850> we're<00:02:30.000> going<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.180> cut<00:02:30.630> this

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
nice mark so now we're going to cut this

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.460 
nice mark so now we're going to cut this
this<00:02:31.680> is<00:02:31.830> going<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.010> be<00:02:32.100> scrapped<00:02:33.290> then<00:02:34.290> we're

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
the mark I made is right here you see it

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.110 
the mark I made is right here you see it
fits<00:02:43.440> in<00:02:43.650> but<00:02:44.100> it's<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.370> wrong<00:02:44.460> direction<00:02:44.700> we

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
fits in but it's the wrong direction we

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.950 
fits in but it's the wrong direction we
gotta<00:02:45.300> turn<00:02:45.570> it<00:02:45.720> around<00:02:45.800> which<00:02:46.800> is<00:02:47.040> again<00:02:47.960> put

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
gotta turn it around which is again put

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.160 
gotta turn it around which is again put
it<00:02:49.020> right<00:02:49.140> there<00:02:49.200> like<00:02:49.650> Eric<00:02:50.930> hold<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:52.020> little

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
it right there like Eric hold a little

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.530 
it right there like Eric hold a little
pressure<00:02:52.410> on<00:02:52.910> now<00:02:53.910> you<00:02:54.420> can<00:02:54.570> see<00:02:55.340> nice<00:02:56.540> perfect

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
pressure on now you can see nice perfect

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.750 
pressure on now you can see nice perfect
