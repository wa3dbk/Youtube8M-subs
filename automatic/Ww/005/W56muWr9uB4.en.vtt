00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.310 
of this pregnancy and let's start with
the<00:00:17.190> physical<00:00:17.810> physically<00:00:18.810> I'm<00:00:19.020> feeling

the physical physically I'm feeling

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.290 
the physical physically I'm feeling
great<00:00:19.650> I<00:00:19.859> started<00:00:20.250> walking<00:00:20.580> again<00:00:20.880> which<00:00:21.180> has

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
great I started walking again which has

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.390 
great I started walking again which has
been<00:00:21.539> such<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.050> joy<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.740> I<00:00:23.130> think<00:00:23.310> really

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
been such a joy and I think really

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.130 
been such a joy and I think really
helping<00:00:23.939> with<00:00:24.060> my<00:00:24.180> energy<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:24.689> week<00:00:24.869> I

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
helping with my energy this week I

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.019 
helping with my energy this week I
actually<00:00:25.529> stopped<00:00:26.099> there<00:00:26.310> for<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.519> while<00:00:26.670> and

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
actually stopped there for a while and

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.550 
actually stopped there for a while and
the<00:00:27.269> reason<00:00:27.300> why<00:00:27.660> is<00:00:27.720> every<00:00:28.019> time<00:00:28.109> I<00:00:28.170> would<00:00:28.410> go

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
the reason why is every time I would go

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.439 
the reason why is every time I would go
out<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.710> walk<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.369> would<00:00:29.550> get<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.789> cramping<00:00:30.359> in

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
out to walk I would get the cramping in

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.330 
out to walk I would get the cramping in
the<00:00:30.539> braxton-hicks<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.949> just<00:00:32.130> kind<00:00:32.279> of

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
the braxton-hicks and it just kind of

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.340 
the braxton-hicks and it just kind of
spooked<00:00:32.669> me<00:00:32.850> out<00:00:32.969> even<00:00:33.719> though<00:00:33.870> people<00:00:34.050> said

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
spooked me out even though people said

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.750 
spooked me out even though people said
it<00:00:34.440> was<00:00:34.530> normal<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.130> yada<00:00:35.280> yada<00:00:35.460> yeah<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.700> just

protein<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.530> remember<00:01:11.100> reading<00:01:11.280> about<00:01:11.400> this

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
protein I remember reading about this

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.880 
protein I remember reading about this
guy<00:01:11.670> called<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.180> Brewer<00:01:12.479> diet<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.260> this

guy called the Brewer diet and this

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.340 
guy called the Brewer diet and this
doctor<00:01:14.250> really<00:01:14.600> recommended<00:01:15.600> at<00:01:15.689> least<00:01:16.020> 80

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
doctor really recommended at least 80

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.109 
doctor really recommended at least 80
grams<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.830> protein<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> day<00:01:17.220> which<00:01:17.729> sometimes

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
grams of protein a day which sometimes

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.969 
grams of protein a day which sometimes
it's<00:01:18.299> kind<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.509> hard<00:01:18.570> hit<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.259> money<00:01:19.439> in<00:01:19.650> and

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
it's kind of hard hit that money in and

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.760 
it's kind of hard hit that money in and
some<00:01:20.490> moms<00:01:20.790> they<00:01:21.119> even<00:01:21.420> wants<00:01:21.659> like<00:01:21.750> 120<00:01:22.500> grams

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
some moms they even wants like 120 grams

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.140 
some moms they even wants like 120 grams
a<00:01:22.950> day<00:01:22.979> like<00:01:23.189> if<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.430> really<00:01:23.670> struggled<00:01:24.090> with

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
a day like if you really struggled with

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.160 
a day like if you really struggled with
different<00:01:24.509> things<00:01:24.659> during<00:01:24.869> your<00:01:25.020> pregnancy

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
different things during your pregnancy

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.260 
different things during your pregnancy
so<00:01:26.130> I've<00:01:26.310> been<00:01:26.369> really<00:01:26.700> boost<00:01:27.000> in<00:01:27.150> those

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
so I've been really boost in those

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.120 
so I've been really boost in those
levels<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.720> just<00:01:27.930> maybe<00:01:28.320> think<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.860> might

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
levels and I just maybe think that might

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.700 
levels and I just maybe think that might

wonderful doulas and my husband and
everything<00:03:08.840> I<00:03:09.020> felt<00:03:09.890> so<00:03:10.190> far<00:03:10.489> from<00:03:10.790> God<00:03:11.030> in

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
everything I felt so far from God in

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.380 
everything I felt so far from God in
moments<00:03:11.630> I<00:03:11.780> mean<00:03:11.959> it<00:03:12.170> was<00:03:12.320> just<00:03:12.610> so<00:03:13.610> physically

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
moments I mean it was just so physically

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.360 
moments I mean it was just so physically
demanding<00:03:14.690> that<00:03:15.260> I<00:03:15.320> was<00:03:15.500> so<00:03:15.709> on<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:15.890> human

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
demanding that I was so on the human

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.920 
demanding that I was so on the human
plane<00:03:16.670> it<00:03:16.880> was<00:03:16.970> very<00:03:17.209> difficult<00:03:17.420> for<00:03:17.660> me<00:03:17.900> to

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
plane it was very difficult for me to

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.130 
plane it was very difficult for me to
rise<00:03:18.440> above<00:03:18.920> think<00:03:19.820> on<00:03:19.970> higher<00:03:20.450> things<00:03:20.480> to

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
rise above think on higher things to

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.290 
rise above think on higher things to
have<00:03:21.230> my<00:03:21.320> spirit<00:03:21.770> be<00:03:21.890> lifted<00:03:22.370> and<00:03:22.670> I'm<00:03:23.090> just

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
have my spirit be lifted and I'm just

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.760 
have my spirit be lifted and I'm just
hoping<00:03:23.450> to<00:03:23.660> do<00:03:23.870> it<00:03:23.959> differently<00:03:24.320> this<00:03:24.530> time

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
hoping to do it differently this time

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.500 
hoping to do it differently this time
around<00:03:24.980> so<00:03:25.430> yeah<00:03:25.970> I<00:03:26.000> mean<00:03:26.270> there<00:03:26.390> was

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
around so yeah I mean there was

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:27.729 
around so yeah I mean there was
certainly<00:03:26.780> moments<00:03:27.140> with<00:03:27.230> Griffin's<00:03:27.530> birth

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
certainly moments with Griffin's birth

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.170 
certainly moments with Griffin's birth
for<00:03:28.040> example<00:03:28.400> when<00:03:28.520> the<00:03:28.610> water<00:03:28.880> my<00:03:29.150> water

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
when I would dilate and keep progressing

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.770 
when I would dilate and keep progressing
