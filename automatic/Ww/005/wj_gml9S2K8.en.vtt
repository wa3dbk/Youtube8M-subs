00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.289
 Today, I have a great guest next door. 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.919
 We have it here on Etna, she just got out of school, 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:24.419
 and she will show us the entire zoo home garden. 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:26.899
 I say this because Etna has 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:29.019
 I do not know exactly how many rabbits, 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:30.109
 Guinea pigs, 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.470
 and just what his father persuaded to take a chinchilla. 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.980
 What names will you put? 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.270
 Elena. Very good, Elena. But why did you choose this name? 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.470
 I'm really curious ... 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.110
 You know someone 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.220
 with the name of Elena? 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.010
 Yes. Who? My sister! 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.520
 And your sister would like quinchilla to be named? 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.970
 I do not think he will enjoy it very much. 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.380
 Very well, let's see how they will understand 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.060
 because in this video 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:07.290
 I want to talk about intraspecific coexistence, 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.640
 how they understand rabbits, guinea pigs, 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.170
 chinchillas, and if we can put together 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.920
 different animal breeds. 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.600
 There are some basic rules that we will never be able to join 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.990
 a predator a prey, that is, we never put a joint together 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.720
 with a rabbit, or a dog and a rabbit, and if 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.640
 we do, we have to take great care. 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.510
 Instead, we can make it coexist 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.170
 rodents between them or lagomorphs and rodents. 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.500
 In this case, Etna was lucky, only good grades 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.080
 at school, and that's why her father allowed this 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.250
 garden zoo inside the house. 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.380
 And, how do they get along? Etna, give it to me and we'll see it right away! 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.920
 Normally, rodents between them are pretty good. 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.680
 We have no major problems, you will see how, for the beginning, 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.680
 they start to know, smell, wash. 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.659
 Look, Elena has adapted very well to my group of friends! 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:25.630
 As I was saying, 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.959
 the rodents, between them, 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.119
 and lagomorphic animals, along with rodents, 

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:35.359
 are pets that can cohabit and can accommodate 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:36.759
 without any problem. In addition, 

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:42.809
 food, even if it is not the same, is very similar, having a proportion of 80-90% 

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:44.729
 the same nutrients. So, 

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:48.900
 nor will this aspect give you much trouble. It is phenomenal, 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:52.129
 I own a company, you have different pets, it seems to me an idea 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:53.169
 extraordinary.
