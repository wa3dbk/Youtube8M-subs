00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.390
 It was already for Fernandez Navarrete I thank who cares in this 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.389
 night concert of 6 7 according to the opportunity to power 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:14.049
 and we are going to listen 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:17.049
 to óscar sanchez 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:28.429
 like other misfortunes of the deposits I am going to save you to repeat the matter to you 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.779
 that is working well that is progressing 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.860
 I know that you are managing to reach the limits of your faculties and that this is 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.430
 Worthy of praise 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.629
 but if I want 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:39.700
 instead 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.170
 underline something that I think speaks a lot 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.820
 what you are and what you can or what I think you should not try to do 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.980
 this song 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.710
 obviously that is a challenge 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.070
 it's not even a glove thrown in the face 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.320
 has to serve 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.019
 a challenge now the worst 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:00.430
 must be 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.980
 a manifestation 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.100
 of a superb 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.880
 and of a 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.070
 expression 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.320
 so the others think 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.480
 which frankly I consider you incapable 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:19.280
 You are a very well-educated girl and you notice and finally but it does not help me. 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.340
 It's good because here you had to come to me to shout and have it 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.350
 furious 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.630
 that as a tenerife plant requires 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.610
 scu perm in the head visible &amp; lt people this letter that came so handy at hand 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:31.540
 do not 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.930
 I think that's what I mean 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.970
 you are within your limits 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.070
 and I put another day you love me 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.690
 scream uglier please do because I think it's going to be an instance of 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.980
 growth I give thanks is that I do not want to fall mumbai that annul times is 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:46.530
 mutual 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.530
 Hahaha 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.880
 nothing to do 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.120
 percent I would 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.860
 it was square 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.680
 again we drag 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.840
 Suddenly unfortunate 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.930
 if you sang it very sweet for what the song asks but I had fun 

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:16.999
 the hardest thing to say 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:20.409
 they wait for their turn the Hidalgo stadium 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.999
 fed up with the legislator but made of art 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:24.069
 her 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.069
 I can not complain 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.519
 Then polite lolita that plausible in this stretch that goes from where we lived 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.530
 of the school of municipalities of quillón monaguillo yb 

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:39.409
 d the lady of the camellias and 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:41.379
 and now where are we going to stop 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:42.949
 before the whole year 

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:46.109
 can not continue 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:49.109
 kiko climbing 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:54.199
 the outrageous what happens here is outrageous 

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:58.589
 he has no dignity 

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:04.019
 the height 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.019
 hurt because the first and 2 rescue 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:11.549
 what I do know is that this 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.569
 percent 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.709
 Alaska 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.049
 who saw was the first interpreter this song tastes of the burgaleses 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.190
 He is a person who does not sing 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.190
 and she says it teo does not sing anything 

00:03:26.529 --> 00:03:29.529
 then this of the country is 

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:33.449
 it's frustrating to hear 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:36.949
 that gives you a song for a look that comes from a person who does not sing and who 

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:38.669
 it really is not needed 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:42.039
 let it be a great voice but you can not even get it 

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:44.219
 by citing out 

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:46.119
 as is necessary 

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:50.059
 already when his view to the stage that was missing the air a lot was heard 

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:51.499
 too much fuss 

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:53.679
 in tubes to sing 

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:57.079
 we continue with problems of tuning we continue with problems 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:01.619
 i the independently of the square what good in this case are from tikizia 

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:02.939
 does matters 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:04.179
 egan 

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:06.889
 sykes staying very short 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:08.649
 it is physically 

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:12.929
 come they have in mind attitude what is it that I imagine that the teacher 

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:16.199
 sarkis this time and people are still waiting for short and that's when I say 

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:19.909
 despite the weight alias the sheikh and in this song 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.470
 or what to talk to the statesman 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.280
 flirted with some very nice pants if you throw yourself on the floor and sculpts text 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.280
 edges is over so it's very easy 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:33.419
 that you need a lot 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.800
 very much to study so that you can carry out everything that is needed 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.210
 even with such a song 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.539
 vogue like this or in this mind 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:47.539
 when you wear a miniskirt and the campers and makes you go up and down 

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:52.080
 it's like when we say dam not active sending not 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.680
 the psc dt 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.919
 nightly pay whatever it is that really makes you 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:00.419
 do everything you are being asked why not 

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:05.969
 these at a point in time 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:08.309
 one more and yes 

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:11.639
 I am trying to give time to see if 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:16.529
 sykes and it really amazes me is how at some point I said pommerat I think that 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:20.050
 It's going very well and they have not found that perfect, not the cave, which does not really work well 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.020
 but you are 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.490
 ten is going back 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.559
 that's seriously bernabé tyneside and media 

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:28.509
 because it's a bocon song 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:30.939
 what is not is a song moves 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:32.509
 only ours 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:36.569
 but it does not clarify much is a bland song to sing to see to see in both 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:37.229
 chiapas 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:40.479
 because I want to devote to it you may still have nothing to do 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:43.539
 carefully what 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:45.259
 we know that you sing cute 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:47.379
 but you're not a professional singer 

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:50.719
 we agree well then you can go 

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:52.689
 what a singer 

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:55.689
 I imagine that this is not going to put Ayub Libya 

00:05:56.749 --> 00:06:00.029
 because there's a reason why she's a bonus singer 

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:05.189
 fignon with this good goal have not done it and all these songs bland as 

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:06.280
 they put them on 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.029
 they end up putting on the streets 

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:10.889
 I'll be attentive enough with ee
