here it's actually the konjac that is
made<00:01:55.909> of<00:01:56.090> that<00:01:56.329> cleanses<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:56.960> skin<00:01:57.079> for<00:01:57.530> you

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
made of that cleanses the skin for you

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.039 
made of that cleanses the skin for you
so<00:01:58.820> I'm<00:01:58.969> gonna<00:01:59.060> take<00:01:59.270> one<00:01:59.329> of<00:01:59.450> the<00:01:59.570> edges<00:01:59.930> of

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
so I'm gonna take one of the edges of

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:01.870 
so I'm gonna take one of the edges of
the<00:02:00.140> sponge<00:02:00.439> and<00:02:00.740> just<00:02:00.799> go<00:02:01.130> around<00:02:01.610> my<00:02:01.700> eye

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
the sponge and just go around my eye

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.440 
the sponge and just go around my eye
I<00:02:02.060> shall<00:02:02.270> go<00:02:02.390> that<00:02:02.570> way<00:02:03.219> and<00:02:04.219> the<00:02:05.030> benefit<00:02:05.420> of

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
I shall go that way and the benefit of

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.979 
I shall go that way and the benefit of
this<00:02:05.689> is<00:02:06.020> this<00:02:06.170> texture<00:02:06.969> it's<00:02:07.969> it's<00:02:08.329> very<00:02:08.450> soft

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
this is this texture it's it's very soft

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.630 
this is this texture it's it's very soft
it's<00:02:09.170> not<00:02:09.259> as<00:02:09.350> hard<00:02:09.590> as<00:02:09.709> a<00:02:09.769> loofah<00:02:10.160> it's<00:02:10.399> very

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
it's not as hard as a loofah it's very

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.530 
it's not as hard as a loofah it's very
very<00:02:10.910> soft<00:02:11.180> almost<00:02:11.390> like

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
very soft almost like

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.360 
very soft almost like
blame<00:02:13.780> that<00:02:13.989> it's<00:02:14.829> really<00:02:15.040> difficult<00:02:15.189> to

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
blame that it's really difficult to

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.979 
blame that it's really difficult to
explain<00:02:15.430> and<00:02:15.939> they're<00:02:16.390> really<00:02:16.510> reasonably

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
explain and they're really reasonably

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.119 
explain and they're really reasonably
priced<00:02:17.230> as<00:02:17.409> well<00:02:17.530> I'll<00:02:17.620> get<00:02:17.739> to<00:02:17.799> that<00:02:17.980> in<00:02:18.069> a

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
priced as well I'll get to that in a

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:19.890 
priced as well I'll get to that in a
minute<00:02:18.219> but<00:02:18.519> this<00:02:19.030> texture<00:02:19.569> will<00:02:19.689> exfoliate

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
minute but this texture will exfoliate

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.039 
minute but this texture will exfoliate
the<00:02:20.379> skin<00:02:20.409> very<00:02:20.980> very<00:02:21.219> mildly<00:02:21.579> and<00:02:21.849> the<00:02:22.510> thing

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
the skin very very mildly and the thing

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:25.259 
the skin very very mildly and the thing
I<00:02:23.170> love<00:02:23.319> about<00:02:23.349> it<00:02:23.769> is<00:02:23.890> there's<00:02:24.819> not<00:02:24.939> very<00:02:25.000> many

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
I love about it is there's not very many

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:26.610 
I love about it is there's not very many
products<00:02:25.659> that<00:02:25.750> you<00:02:26.019> can<00:02:26.109> use<00:02:26.170> around<00:02:26.500> the

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
products that you can use around the

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.759 
products that you can use around the
eyes<00:02:26.799> that<00:02:27.609> are<00:02:27.939> gentle<00:02:28.439> but<00:02:29.439> will<00:02:29.590> still

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
eyes that are gentle but will still

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.259 
eyes that are gentle but will still
exfoliate<00:02:30.310> at<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.459> same<00:02:30.609> time<00:02:30.879> so<00:02:31.180> I'm

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
exfoliate at the same time so I'm

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:32.910 
exfoliate at the same time so I'm
basically<00:02:31.420> just<00:02:31.659> pinching<00:02:32.140> it<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:32.470> create

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
basically just pinching it to create

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.640 
basically just pinching it to create
more<00:02:33.250> of<00:02:33.310> a<00:02:33.519> flat<00:02:33.760> surface<00:02:34.230> smaller<00:02:35.230> surface

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
more of a flat surface smaller surface

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.690 
more of a flat surface smaller surface
for<00:02:35.799> around<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.069> eye<00:02:36.129> and<00:02:36.909> it's<00:02:37.150> basically

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
for around the eye and it's basically

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.390 
for around the eye and it's basically
massaging<00:02:40.200> around<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.319> eye<00:02:41.349> area<00:02:41.829> to<00:02:41.889> get<00:02:42.159> rid

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
massaging around the eye area to get rid

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.330 
massaging around the eye area to get rid
of<00:02:42.430> dead<00:02:42.790> skin<00:02:42.939> cells<00:02:43.829> I'm<00:02:44.829> just<00:02:45.040> going<00:02:45.310> to

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
this into the socket there and it just

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:55.679 
this into the socket there and it just
removes<00:02:50.099> no<00:02:51.569> violet<00:02:52.569> off<00:02:52.799> of<00:02:53.799> your<00:02:54.010> makeup<00:02:54.689> I'm
