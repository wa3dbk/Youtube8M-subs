00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
want to see where the big arrows are and

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.400 
want to see where the big arrows are and
obviously<00:02:48.550> go<00:02:49.180> through<00:02:49.480> there<00:02:49.720> and<00:02:49.930> get<00:02:50.230> the

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
obviously go through there and get the

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.250 
obviously go through there and get the
evidence<00:02:50.560> as<00:02:51.100> you<00:02:51.940> can<00:02:52.239> watch<00:02:52.660> out<00:02:52.930> for<00:02:53.200> items

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
evidence as you can watch out for items

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.770 
evidence as you can watch out for items
like<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.440> walls<00:02:56.680> and<00:02:57.130> the<00:02:57.970> object<00:02:58.360> is<00:02:58.510> to

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
like the walls and the object is to

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.780 
like the walls and the object is to
again<00:02:59.260> get<00:02:59.560> all<00:02:59.739> the<00:02:59.890> evidence<00:03:00.220> as<00:03:00.430> quick<00:03:00.640> as

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
again get all the evidence as quick as

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.880 
again get all the evidence as quick as
you<00:03:00.910> can<00:03:00.940> the<00:03:01.810> fast<00:03:02.050> you<00:03:02.290> get<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.650> evidence

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
you can the fast you get the evidence

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.300 
you can the fast you get the evidence
the<00:03:03.790> better<00:03:04.030> its<00:03:04.780> bet<00:03:05.140> whoops<00:03:05.470> make<00:03:06.010> sure<00:03:06.040> you

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
the better its bet whoops make sure you

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.559 
the better its bet whoops make sure you
know<00:03:06.430> which<00:03:06.550> way<00:03:06.700> you're<00:03:06.730> going<00:03:07.030> though<00:03:07.330> and

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
know which way you're going though and

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.140 
know which way you're going though and
you<00:03:07.870> can<00:03:08.050> use<00:03:08.200> your<00:03:08.350> ram<00:03:08.650> in<00:03:08.920> this<00:03:09.040> case<00:03:09.340> to<00:03:09.970> be

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
you can use your ram in this case to be

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.350 
you can use your ram in this case to be
a<00:03:10.330> quicker<00:03:10.720> to<00:03:11.560> give<00:03:11.680> you<00:03:11.769> some<00:03:12.010> speed<00:03:12.459> head

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
a quicker to give you some speed head

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.330 
a quicker to give you some speed head
back<00:03:13.600> here<00:03:14.050> get<00:03:14.380> the<00:03:14.560> evidence<00:03:14.890> we<00:03:14.980> didn't<00:03:15.160> get

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
back here get the evidence we didn't get

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.100 
back here get the evidence we didn't get
and<00:03:15.850> there's<00:03:16.180> one<00:03:16.390> more<00:03:18.600> it<00:03:19.600> looks<00:03:19.810> like<00:03:19.870> it's

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
and there's one more it looks like it's

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.890 
and there's one more it looks like it's
on<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:20.380> other<00:03:20.440> side<00:03:20.530> of<00:03:20.799> street

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.820 

which<00:03:24.900> I<00:03:25.200> didn't<00:03:25.530> need<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:25.710> go<00:03:25.860> this<00:03:25.980> far<00:03:26.190> down

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.070 

the<00:03:31.830> arrow<00:03:32.040> gets<00:03:32.160> bigger<00:03:32.640> and<00:03:33.390> we<00:03:33.660> wasted<00:03:34.020> a

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
the arrow gets bigger and we wasted a

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.450 
the arrow gets bigger and we wasted a
lot<00:03:34.110> of<00:03:34.260> time<00:03:34.350> trying<00:03:34.860> to<00:03:34.980> get<00:03:35.130> the<00:03:35.310> evidence

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:35.460 
lot of time trying to get the evidence

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.150 
lot of time trying to get the evidence
maybe<00:03:35.850> we<00:03:36.030> went<00:03:36.240> and<00:03:36.360> got<00:03:36.450> a<00:03:36.660> donut<00:03:37.500> so<00:03:38.130> I

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
maybe we went and got a donut so I

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.770 
maybe we went and got a donut so I
didn't<00:03:38.460> do<00:03:38.520> as<00:03:38.670> well<00:03:38.700> on<00:03:38.910> this<00:03:39.209> I<00:03:39.420> still<00:03:39.600> got
