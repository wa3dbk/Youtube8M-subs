00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.140
 part of the right foot pack 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.060
 as promised 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.060
 with the growth of the Brazilian GDP 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.750
 Bank of Brazil 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.940
 in the center of the goal 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.940
 claudia barbÃªdo on the right and hit 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.880
 I like to overcome 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.320
 nearly 600,000 members of the public prosecution and press 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.790
 was very good 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.190
 this is over 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.190
 no doubt that he was goalkeeper 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.040
 from now on 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.040
 the right foot hit goalkeeper clemer 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.410
 so thinking June 17 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.710
 two pilots 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.710
 Setubal parts 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.500
 both drivers were very productive 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.390
 in this day 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.210
 everyone here said many of them been included since 2005 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.080
 in the first port and the one of descent 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.550
 authorizes the referee 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.550
 enter friend 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.880
 by the status of the elderly 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.850
 Julius Caesar crossed from the left 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.850
 in an attempt to escape 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.400
 I feel the first goal 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.400
 two by parties on each side 

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:14.779
 can not lose a penalty at 12 minutes 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.549
 There goes a passerby with the collection 

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:24.929
 is the other of the left leg 

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:38.529
 in the first semester 

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:42.079
 but the dispute is always paulo 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:44.269
 at the end of 2010 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.269
 and in Bradesco and downtown 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.130
 in recent years in chile 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.130
 in recent months 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.220
 Paraguayan is drying up. 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.569
 all you need 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.569
 need of the citizen 

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:14.369
 if he does it all depends on nine of the 12 months 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:21.239
 on the right foot 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:22.749
 clear party 

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:23.839
 I'm not 

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:26.839
 they beat 

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:40.469
 out of Brazilian football 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:43.469
 someway 

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:49.729
 someway 

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:54.089
 lose four penalties in a row 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:56.719
 beating 

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:59.339
 thus 

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:00.919
 practically in the hands of the goalkeeper
