00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.900
 cakes or as they are called khachapuri 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.330
 in Imereti 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.460
 There are great Khachapuri recipes 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.500
 The set can be made and yeast and 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.720
 yeastless today we will do those 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.620
 which are made on yoghurt without yeast and 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:41.410
 fry them in a khachapuri griddle and 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.150
 we take 1 glass of matsoni if you don't have 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.210
 This can be replaced calmly 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.880
 yogurt sour cream or yogurt 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.980
 two and a half cups of flour a little more 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.489
 than two and a half two and three quarters 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.620
 one egg half a spoon of soda 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:00.360
 a teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:10.080
 sugar and 3 4 spoons of vegetable oil and 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:10.080
 top and matsoni 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.550
 add soda it should be a little bit 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.140
 extinguished 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:24.970
 that is, here on our surface 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:29.940
 bubbles are added here 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.940
 sugar salt 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:49.420
 and sift flour 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.420
 start kneading dough 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:39.950
 certainly not one dough knead the spatula 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:46.370
 impossible need add on hands in dough 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:47.030
 cooking oil and knead the dough already 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.720
 manually 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:54.410
 dough at this stage we need to collect 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.660
 in one whom it is desirable that of course she 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.910
 not very much sticking you with the 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.580
 if a little stick I would stop at 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.490
 this batch would not seek 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.490
 of such a tight condition we later 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:10.580
 help flour I can blind what we 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:13.720
 need to stir the dough do not need it 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:19.790
 then it becomes a little rough 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:21.470
 here is the remaining flour so our dough 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:27.020
 for khachapuri 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:29.680
 ready to torment him is not necessary in this form 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.680
 we leave it for 20 minutes for 30 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.680
 relax 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:39.560
 I will immediately say that I kneaded the dough on 4 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.570
 khachapuri I will do now only two 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.230
 I put the test at the veche for two 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.590
 khachapuri 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.390
 I'll take for the filling 300 grams of cheese 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.240
 Suluguni can still say take 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.310

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.970
 one egg 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:02.920
 all this I have to pull on large 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.920
 grater and butter and cheese 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.550
 I rubbed butter and cheese 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:21.989
 add it here and pretty 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.510
 knead if you have a desire 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.250
 add greens here 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:29.040
 then please restrain from it 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.620
 heap deed is never added this 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.990
 there will already be something different on what we have 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.850
 should not be standing bare 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.770
 a little knit if you do not 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:41.490
 it turned out you can add one more 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.320
 and be sure to try your cheese hard 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.320
 salty cheese and what's not called 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.900
 comme il faut he needs to mean either soak 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.260
 or else add a little curd 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.660
 and if you have a dream too much 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.820
 then it can be a little bit at podsolit 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.610
 i'm completely perfect i mean i have 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.890
 the filling is ready as I said I will 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:05.010
 I want to do 2 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:07.530
 as we remember, khachapuri is bread is cheese 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:12.060
 with bread they are bread son therefore fillings 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:16.350
 there must be a little bit here I divide by two 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:20.400
 pieces and wait until my dough fits and 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:22.820
 the filling and the dough is ready for me 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.820
 just wait 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:31.049
 our dough was resting mobile removed so 

00:05:28.679 --> 00:05:35.369
 I told him only two ocakov lay 

00:05:31.049 --> 00:05:38.179
 now the table surface and abundantly 

00:05:35.369 --> 00:05:38.179
 sprinkle with flour 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:50.240
 naturally there must be flour here too 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:56.690
 reloading protest I divide him by 2 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:58.700
 equal parts as you see with us 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.730
 rounds with dough about this 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:04.670
 same size are obtained like cheese 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:09.110
 fillings in principle dough should be 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:12.940
 either less or the same does not 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:19.880
 on the contrary and proceed so to speak cells 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:22.880
 slightly crush the cakes shark 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:29.200
 our turn the cake lay here 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:32.200
 we connect the filling on top 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.200
 the edges 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:51.370
 everything is tightly closed overturned 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:53.409
 and gently will not that much flour you 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.620
 before you fry everything you go 

00:06:53.409 --> 00:07:02.259
 shake 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:05.770
 gently knead our pancake on 

00:07:02.259 --> 00:07:08.050
 such a thickness and at such a diameter 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:09.819
 which is perfect for your 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:12.250
 pans that you are going to drink 

00:07:09.819 --> 00:07:16.030
 if you have 26 centimeters approach 

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:17.860
 to this size I am 28 to the menu 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:20.710
 should be about this 

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:26.139
 the size is exactly the same I do with 

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:30.180
 Tuesday that we will fry fry khachapuri 

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:35.110
 on a well heated dry skillet 

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:36.729
 we lay seam down slightly 

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:40.500
 trim naturally so that we have 

00:07:36.729 --> 00:07:43.300
 occupied the whole area and fry minutes 

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:46.560
 two or three i don't know maybe 4 yet 

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:48.310
 we won't get reddened down 

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:50.349
 finished cake 

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:54.130
 we shoot we turn on another 

00:07:50.349 --> 00:07:56.009
 side down too we grease a 

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:59.110
 the site 

00:07:56.009 --> 00:08:02.319
 can be served with wine greens 

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:04.529
 with tomatoes with other vegetables 

00:08:02.319 --> 00:08:07.830
 I think nothing else is needed
