00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:01.479 
with jazz I grew up with blues it was
all<00:00:58.769> around<00:00:59.010> me<00:00:59.309> as<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.820> child<00:01:00.269> my<00:01:00.960> parents

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
all around me as a child my parents

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.100 
all around me as a child my parents
always<00:01:02.489> seemed<00:01:02.970> to<00:01:03.030> have<00:01:03.180> had<00:01:03.390> their<00:01:03.600> backs<00:01:03.870> up

always seemed to have had their backs up
against<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.559> wall<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.129> yet<00:01:06.090> they<00:01:06.300> were<00:01:06.360> able

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
against the wall and yet they were able

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.330 
against the wall and yet they were able
to<00:01:06.780> come<00:01:07.080> through<00:01:07.110> these<00:01:07.830> very<00:01:08.100> difficult

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
to come through these very difficult

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.080 
to come through these very difficult
times<00:01:08.670> with<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.300> lot<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.979> pride<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.370> dignity<00:01:11.550> of

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
times with a lot of pride and dignity of

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.350 
times with a lot of pride and dignity of
which<00:01:12.900> they<00:01:13.229> passed<00:01:13.590> on<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.130> me<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.580> think

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
which they passed on to me I think

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.140 
which they passed on to me I think
there's<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.600> lot<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.930> dignity<00:01:16.440> in<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.190> music<00:01:18.030> of

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
there's a lot of dignity in the music of

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.630 
there's a lot of dignity in the music of
blues<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.450> jazz<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.729> I<00:01:21.470> expect<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.620> it's<00:01:23.520> a

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
blues and jazz and I expect that it's a

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.810 
blues and jazz and I expect that it's a
kind<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.090> thing<00:01:24.149> that<00:01:24.719> really<00:01:25.560> comes<00:01:25.860> from<00:01:26.280> way

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
kind of thing that really comes from way

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.450 
kind of thing that really comes from way
back<00:01:27.240> in<00:01:27.299> our<00:01:28.219> heritage<00:01:29.299> my<00:01:30.299> music<00:01:31.310> seems<00:01:32.310> to

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
back in our heritage my music seems to

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.820 
back in our heritage my music seems to
come<00:01:32.640> from<00:01:32.850> deep<00:01:33.090> inside

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.640 

I<00:01:35.920> have<00:01:36.550> a<00:01:36.580> lot<00:01:36.790> of<00:01:36.910> strong<00:01:37.180> feelings<00:01:37.810> I<00:01:38.080> cry

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
I have a lot of strong feelings I cry

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.870 
I have a lot of strong feelings I cry
easily<00:01:40.080> my<00:01:41.080> mother<00:01:41.260> used<00:01:41.500> to<00:01:41.590> say<00:01:41.860> that<00:01:42.610> I<00:01:42.670> was

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
easily my mother used to say that I was

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.030 
easily my mother used to say that I was
an<00:01:43.000> old<00:01:43.180> soul<00:01:43.540> like<00:01:43.960> I<00:01:44.110> had<00:01:44.230> been<00:01:44.440> here<00:01:44.650> before

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
an old soul like I had been here before

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.360 
an old soul like I had been here before
because<00:01:45.310> I<00:01:45.550> seem<00:01:46.000> to<00:01:46.140> have<00:01:47.140> had<00:01:47.410> such<00:01:47.770> deep

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.370 
because I seem to have had such deep

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.190 
because I seem to have had such deep
feelings<00:01:48.910> in<00:01:49.030> my<00:01:49.150> music<00:01:49.570> and<00:01:49.690> I<00:01:49.780> couldn't<00:01:50.080> have

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
feelings in my music and I couldn't have

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.360 
feelings in my music and I couldn't have
had<00:01:50.410> those<00:01:50.650> kind<00:01:50.980> of<00:01:51.070> experiences<00:01:51.880> in<00:01:52.480> my<00:01:52.720> life

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
had those kind of experiences in my life

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.510 
had those kind of experiences in my life
I<00:01:54.810> really<00:01:55.810> think<00:01:56.080> that<00:01:56.140> it's<00:01:56.470> taken<00:01:56.920> me<00:01:57.100> this

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
I really think that it's taken me this

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.090 
I really think that it's taken me this
30<00:01:58.270> years<00:01:58.630> to<00:01:58.840> really<00:01:59.020> understand<00:01:59.800> the

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
30 years to really understand the

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.740 
30 years to really understand the
deepness<00:02:00.340> of<00:02:00.790> this<00:02:02.550> the<00:02:03.550> feelings<00:02:04.420> that<00:02:04.570> I

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
deepness of this the feelings that I

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.290 
deepness of this the feelings that I
have<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:06.340> I<00:02:06.520> do<00:02:06.580> think<00:02:07.090> that<00:02:07.150> it<00:02:07.390> comes<00:02:07.630> from

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
have and I do think that it comes from

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.170 
have and I do think that it comes from
just<00:02:10.300> all<00:02:10.479> of<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:10.750> things<00:02:10.780> that<00:02:11.410> I've<00:02:12.250> seen

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
just all of the things that I've seen

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.230 
just all of the things that I've seen
and<00:02:13.540> felt<00:02:13.750> in<00:02:14.050> my<00:02:14.290> childhood<00:02:14.860> and<00:02:15.550> in<00:02:15.910> my<00:02:16.030> life

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
and felt in my childhood and in my life

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.990 
and felt in my childhood and in my life
it's<00:02:17.080> a<00:02:17.230> very<00:02:17.440> special<00:02:17.980> experience<00:02:18.610> to<00:02:18.700> be

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
it's a very special experience to be

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:31.740 
it's a very special experience to be
able<00:02:19.180> to<00:02:21.270> sing<00:02:22.270> jazz<00:02:22.600> and<00:02:23.080> to<00:02:23.410> sing<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.770> blues

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.830 

and<00:02:32.350> I'm<00:02:32.800> really<00:02:33.070> not<00:02:33.310> against<00:02:33.850> singing<00:02:34.570> songs

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
and I'm really not against singing songs

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.480 
and I'm really not against singing songs
like<00:02:35.790> sad<00:02:36.790> songs<00:02:37.120> or<00:02:37.510> lost<00:02:38.500> my<00:02:38.740> man<00:02:38.980> kind<00:02:39.400> of

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
like sad songs or lost my man kind of

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.940 
like sad songs or lost my man kind of
tragic<00:02:39.970> songs<00:02:40.240> because<00:02:40.810> actually<00:02:41.800> that's

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
tragic songs because actually that's

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.240 
tragic songs because actually that's
very<00:02:42.070> much<00:02:42.730> a<00:02:42.760> part<00:02:43.120> of<00:02:43.210> my<00:02:43.360> life<00:02:43.600> and<00:02:43.840> and<00:02:44.250> our

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
very much a part of my life and and our

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.230 
very much a part of my life and and our
lives<00:02:45.460> I'm<00:02:45.730> sure<00:02:45.940> jazz<00:02:46.570> is<00:02:46.780> freer<00:02:47.110> and<00:02:47.760> it<00:02:48.760> it's

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
lives I'm sure jazz is freer and it it's

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.980 
lives I'm sure jazz is freer and it it's
a<00:02:49.360> kind<00:02:49.570> of<00:02:49.660> music<00:02:49.840> that<00:02:50.110> is<00:02:51.540> it's<00:02:52.540> not<00:02:52.750> just

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
a kind of music that is it's not just

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.780 
a kind of music that is it's not just
about<00:02:53.080> improvising<00:02:53.770> and<00:02:54.190> having<00:02:54.490> a<00:02:54.580> lot<00:02:54.760> of

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
about improvising and having a lot of

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.860 
about improvising and having a lot of
notes<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:55.570> over<00:02:56.470> singing<00:02:56.740> or<00:02:57.100> over<00:02:57.490> playing

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
notes and over singing or over playing

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.590 
notes and over singing or over playing
it's<00:02:58.870> about<00:02:59.230> a<00:02:59.500> relaxation<00:02:59.890> and<00:03:00.610> being<00:03:01.030> in<00:03:01.390> the

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
it's about a relaxation and being in the
