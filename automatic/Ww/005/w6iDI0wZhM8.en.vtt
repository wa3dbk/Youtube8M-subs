00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.500
 Welcome to Claire 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:12.500
 full milk I have a waffle 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.480
 by the way, they know that automatically 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.119
 Market leader is with her waffle 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.690
 vending machines so you can enjoy too 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:23.150
 from halliche I already arm but one 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.460
 weapon is a real barely a pleasure 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.590
 for young and old 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.789
 I already have a waffle iron 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.920
 preheated and then we will 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:41.870
 directly marks wonderful wafflebacken so 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:44.390
 pond in the middle of whoops and then can 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:48.320
 In the meantime, I'll give him this one 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.000
 weapons vending machines explain so with these 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.950
 weapons vending machines of chlorine can become 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.460
 nice big guns make you look 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.379
 how nice and thick and hot wax this 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.760
 weapon loudly from the critical beautiful 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:04.430
 thick weapons here we have the waffle 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.020
 form and the light is beautiful deep a deep 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.420
 have waffle shape 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.929
 and then we have one more 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.770
 heavy plate and this heavy back 

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:17.569
 plate ensures that the weapons 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.749
 what is baked evenly 

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:23.810
 It is important that we are flexible 

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:27.889
 hinges see this through this 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:30.439
 Flexible hinges can be the weapon 

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:33.319
 better to go on while baking 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:36.439
 then we have the back here too 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:38.649
 plates with non-stick coating so that 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:41.060
 means they can also be low in fat 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:43.060
 waffle bake if you want that and 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.369
 Of course we have it too 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.630
 simple cleaning what are natural 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.109
 is also important is the 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.749
 degree of browning so here you can 

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:59.209
 the degree of tanning can be infinitely variable 

00:01:53.749 --> 00:02:02.840
 Setting from 1 to 5 our tip three 

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:07.159
 to three and a half that's enough 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:11.120
 so then when the weapon is done then 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.470
 they hear an acoustic awesome but he does 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.630
 I'm already finished 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:19.370
 the acoustic we watch now wow 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:25.990
 he looks good 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.990
 a splendid weapon of mine that way 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:39.110
 hot fukushima a fantastic weapon 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.290
 so and then sprinkle with gorgeous 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:45.650
 powder soup or with cream or fresh 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.690
 strawberries delicious palate watercourse 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.910
 me already in the mouth but I have them 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.090
 tells about the acoustic yes that have 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.940
 she already belongs but we have too 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.790
 a back light as an optical 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.080
 signal we also have red means i 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.040
 I'm after a heat up 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:08.090
 Green means that you can start like this 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:11.060
 Another big advantage is this waffle 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.690
 Automat they can save space 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.780
 put 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:19.010
 As you can see, he stands here on his 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:22.190
 handles and then we have behind 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.280
 we also have a cable winding ideal and 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:29.530
 we even have a plug here 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.970
 depot to everything is thought 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.420
 what do I really need him now ? 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:38.750

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:42.730

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:45.440
 and we have a stainless steel case here 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.650
 they already know everything 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:51.680
 about this choir waffle vending machine 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.660
 the only thing I still tell him 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.299
