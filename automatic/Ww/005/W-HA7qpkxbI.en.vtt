00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.860
 by being just me by going beyond me 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.910
 doing exceptional things and 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.960

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.490
 deadlines 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.890
 in five out of ten to be wary of 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.890
 shebab to film josef stalin as 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.020

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.820
 moment that this lemonade she is 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.220
 opened 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.580
 kenwood johanna rolland i was made is 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.160
 legal 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.890
 close your eyes and do the test there 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.780
 look and how your the average of 5 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.090
 to 10 4 to bac 2 5 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.820
 a quest of 5 out of 10 a recoil of 2 where 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.980
 he was going to have zero votes to fit to 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:29.380
 rottweil maury tech now imagine 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:33.370
 that the coach me the word homepage and the 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:35.750
 julien doctor oudart late retirement 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.120
 2006 people used what did 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.670
 nothing in my opinion your sense of urgency 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.250
 to be able to take it will go from 5 to 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.170
 9 of 10 that's how you can play 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.820
 with your brain when I returned 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.520
 yesterday by the sports hall I got 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.540
 imagined before going back I was 5 on 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.820
 10 I say what can I do 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.890
 to increase for it to be 9 10 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.570
 out of 10 10 hockey I'm going to listen to the 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.010

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.690
 completely connected I will start 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.370
 to scream I will start to jump and 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.870
 that's exactly what I did and the 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.580
 better, I was able to ship the 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.920
 other so it's very easy for 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.350
 people with what you want to do and 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.239
 do it as big as david chiu he 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.110

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:26.030
 something you put the same 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.690
 energy won $ 1 could win 10 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.640
