let's<00:01:37.140> take<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.290> closer<00:01:37.590> look<00:01:37.710> at<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:39.439> piece

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
let's take a closer look at the piece

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.219 
let's take a closer look at the piece
here<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.829> can<00:01:40.979> see<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.250> auditor<00:01:41.670> comes<00:01:42.229> logo

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
here you can see the auditor comes logo

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.249 
here you can see the auditor comes logo
at<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.409> back<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:44.579> can<00:01:44.640> see<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:45.270> tilted

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
at the back you can see the tilted

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.330 
at the back you can see the tilted
design<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:46.799> allows<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.100> basically

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
design that allows you to basically

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.280 
design that allows you to basically
angular<00:01:47.970> fit<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.600> your<00:01:48.750> ear<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:49.140> this

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
angular fit this to your ear so this

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.770 
angular fit this to your ear so this
goes<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.770> right<00:01:50.060> does<00:01:51.060> have<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.450> model

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
goes the right does have the model

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.590 
goes the right does have the model
number<00:01:52.079> there<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:53.070> also<00:01:53.369> fits<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.299> left

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
number there and also fits to the left

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.770 
number there and also fits to the left
very<00:01:55.409> simple<00:01:55.890> no<00:01:56.729> remote<00:01:57.030> control<00:01:57.450> anything

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
very simple no remote control anything

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.980 
very simple no remote control anything
and<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:59.130> course<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.490> right<00:01:59.700> angled<00:02:00.180> connector

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
and of course a right angled connector

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.319 
and of course a right angled connector
so<00:02:01.290> we're<00:02:01.890> going<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.070> test<00:02:02.549> this<00:02:02.670> out<00:02:02.850> see<00:02:03.299> how

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
so we're going to test this out see how

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.270 
so we're going to test this out see how
it<00:02:03.600> works<00:02:03.840> here<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.619> know<00:02:04.710> when<00:02:04.920> he's<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.070> for

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
it works here you know when he's you for

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.490 
it works here you know when he's you for
a<00:02:05.310> little<00:02:05.430> bit<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:06.780> starts<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.350> reveal

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
a little bit and that starts to reveal

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.440 
a little bit and that starts to reveal
dion<00:02:08.129> do

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
dion do

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
dion do
we'll<00:02:08.539> check<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:08.899> car<00:02:09.050> ck<00:02:09.709> 550<00:02:10.780> and<00:02:11.780> my

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
we'll check the car ck 550 and my

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.369 
we'll check the car ck 550 and my
