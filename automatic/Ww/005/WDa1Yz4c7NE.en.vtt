00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:22.329
 the purpose of today's fishing was to check 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.449
 Two new accessories are well fish 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:27.399
 you all know this is not a new element 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.359
 the coil too you all know it samosa 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:33.879
 spend graves 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:36.220
 but not. This is a sample from online. 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:40.629
 absolutely not to which will go 2015 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:44.320
 year she will be called somehow by and 8 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:46.300
 by analogy with the play of the pen braid 5 but here 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.699
 this is it more interesting why because 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:54.010
 she see by the color monochrome such 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:57.070
 an orange would say it is good for 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.140
 geely good and generally good now what 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.260
 concerns the test they gave me a sample here 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.929
 here on the mod on the 50 meters class thread 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.030
 two and a half that is it is very powerful 

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:09.340
 the thread is such a nickname I pulled out 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.130
 took out the code to see this dodger 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.350
 This is the same Dodger who has long 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.710
 at the hearing but for the time being the delivery should 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.659
 be 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.810
 from day to day we shoot this report 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:23.020
 in the middle of October 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.959
 Dodger who is 67 oz shelves well 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.000
 I will say this is such a gentle nicked 

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:30.340
 because there are all sorts of different others 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.729
 options but this bitch is one and a half 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.110
 the auger probably I threw it over my shoulder 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.750
 from there 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.610
 Now our operator will show where to 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.940
 Unfortunately, the operator at this moment too 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.979
 fished himself the moment of pulling out he 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.720
 stayed behind the scenes but nevertheless you 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.340
 can you believe me if you look out 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.369
 into that hole that is behind me 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.789
 there is a horror that is going on here somewhere 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.560
 lived 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.830
 This is actually the first bite for 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.300
 fishing maybe the last fish on this 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.399
 small river frankly 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.399
 from macbook there frog jumps 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:11.780
 in the moment 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.880
 all fish will live I hope that he 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:18.490
 Uncle Vasya who lives in com houses and 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.490
 do not catch it because he is not from let 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.900
 today's fishing is leaning on 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.460
 rarity disgusting all the best 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.970
 points were silent 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.540
 absolutely so our operator natalya 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.380
 Petrovna 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.480
 decided to change the camera to spinning 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.240
 it brought the result of this . 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.270
 caught by her by the way my family 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.160
 wobbler which is called a convoy sinking 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.020
 bezlopastnoy composition nick why she 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.610
 caught so need to feel ask 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.910
 but the fish is caught 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.480
 and it so happened that I caught 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.060
 doublet 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.910
 this bitch is already bigger I think where 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.390
 then so kilo hundred kilo two hundred she caught 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:06.210
 on zavadovsky tail like this 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.520
 called soft for play if we 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.070
 look into her mouth then we find there 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.800
 10 minutes ago I caught more pike 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:17.190
 there this bait is clearly visible but the most 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:20.420
 interesting this is not this little pike 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.620
 and not actually the pike as such 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.460
 new stick but by the way fish 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:33.260
 flew out so pike we safely 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:36.240
 let go there are signs that a new spinning 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:39.750
 on him on the first fishing catch 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:43.080
 impossible i am a materialist physicist and so 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.540
 further but nevertheless came across this 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.000
 signs when it worked a lot 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.950
 once and when did this new spinning have 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.650
 me and when he was with someone else 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.350
 in the hands of this spinning yesterday in this 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:58.710
 time stood in sport hi-tech 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:02.310
 I arrived there and annexed it 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:05.310
 I already caught the second fish at them 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.370
 very damn cool when 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:11.580
 a little fish key, so that's it 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.210
 objects turned catch new 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.520
 spinning 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.520
 and have a lot of fun
