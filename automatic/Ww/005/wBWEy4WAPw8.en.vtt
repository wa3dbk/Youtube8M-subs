something and you guys can pull it up if

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.450 
something and you guys can pull it up if
you<00:00:22.529> want<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.800> look<00:00:22.890> at<00:00:23.070> it<00:00:23.189> while<00:00:23.340> I'm

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
you want to look at it while I'm

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.009 
you want to look at it while I'm
speaking<00:00:23.640> or<00:00:24.000> whatever<00:00:24.240> but<00:00:24.480> that's<00:00:24.869> the

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
speaking or whatever but that's the

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.080 
speaking or whatever but that's the
bracket<00:00:25.500> I'm<00:00:25.710> pretty<00:00:26.400> sure<00:00:26.640> they<00:00:26.939> haven't

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
bracket I'm pretty sure they haven't

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.700 
bracket I'm pretty sure they haven't
changed<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:27.660> they<00:00:27.960> might<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.199> think<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.619> got

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
changed it they might I think it got

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.009 
changed it they might I think it got
locked<00:00:29.010> after<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.640> certain<00:00:30.300> date<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:30.869> hasn't

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
locked after a certain date so it hasn't

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.020 
locked after a certain date so it hasn't
changed<00:00:31.199> even<00:00:32.040> though<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.309> pro<00:00:32.489> points<00:00:32.850> have

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
changed even though the pro points have

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.250 
changed even though the pro points have
changed<00:00:33.420> after<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.690> but<00:00:34.020> they<00:00:34.170> already

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
changed after that but they already

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.440 
changed after that but they already
locked<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:34.739> so<00:00:34.770> anyways<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:36.059> way<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.239> have

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
locked it so anyways the way I have

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.639 
locked it so anyways the way I have
understood<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.260> only<00:00:37.320> have<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.559> win

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
understood it is you only have to win

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.889 
understood it is you only have to win
your<00:00:37.829> first<00:00:38.040> two<00:00:38.250> matches<00:00:38.370> if<00:00:38.879> long<00:00:39.660> as<00:00:39.780> you

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
your first two matches if long as you

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.660 
your first two matches if long as you
win<00:00:40.050> both<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.440> them<00:00:40.559> you're<00:00:40.710> in<00:00:40.860> if<00:00:41.070> you<00:00:41.430> lose

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
win both of them you're in if you lose

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.860 
win both of them you're in if you lose
one<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.120> them<00:00:42.270> you're<00:00:42.450> gonna<00:00:42.540> have<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.719> go<00:00:42.780> to

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
one of them you're gonna have to go to

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.630 
one of them you're gonna have to go to
losers<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.350> win<00:00:43.500> an<00:00:43.620> extra<00:00:43.950> game<00:00:44.100> or<00:00:44.280> two<00:00:44.430> in

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
losers and win an extra game or two in

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.970 
losers and win an extra game or two in
order<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.210> qualify<00:00:45.420> but<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.050> top<00:00:46.289> 16<00:00:46.950> I

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
order to qualify but it is top 16 I

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.040 
order to qualify but it is top 16 I
believe<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.489> qualify<00:00:47.969> although<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.690> did<00:00:48.899> see

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
believe that qualify although I did see

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.779 
believe that qualify although I did see
some<00:00:49.379> where<00:00:49.530> there<00:00:49.649> was<00:00:49.770> top<00:00:49.950> 14<00:00:50.430> which<00:00:50.610> is

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
some where there was top 14 which is

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.910 
some where there was top 14 which is
kind<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.180> weird<00:00:51.360> number<00:00:51.539> but<00:00:52.050> I'm<00:00:52.680> gonna<00:00:52.800> go

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
kind of a weird number but I'm gonna go

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.470 
kind of a weird number but I'm gonna go
and<00:00:53.070> say<00:00:53.160> top<00:00:53.370> 16<00:00:53.789> because<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.090> just<00:00:54.120> makes<00:00:54.420> a

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
and say top 16 because that just makes a

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.139 
and say top 16 because that just makes a
lot<00:00:54.600> more<00:00:54.629> sense<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.320> either<00:00:56.100> way<00:00:56.370> mostly

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
lot more sense so either way mostly

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.430 
lot more sense so either way mostly
seems<00:00:57.390> shouldn't<00:00:57.660> really<00:00:57.750> have<00:00:57.930> any<00:00:58.079> problem

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
seems shouldn't really have any problem

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.500 
seems shouldn't really have any problem
winning<00:00:58.590> their<00:00:58.770> first<00:00:59.010> two<00:00:59.190> matches<00:00:59.510> because

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
winning their first two matches because

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.049 
winning their first two matches because
there's<00:01:00.780> 32<00:01:01.050> teams<00:01:01.440> there's<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.190> lot<00:01:02.430> less

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
there's 32 teams there's a lot less

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.359 
there's 32 teams there's a lot less
competition<00:01:03.660> out<00:01:03.930> there<00:01:04.010> so<00:01:05.010> if<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.220> have<00:01:05.339> a

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
competition out there so if you have a

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.550 
competition out there so if you have a
high<00:01:05.580> seed<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.240> you're<00:01:06.479> playing<00:01:06.750> not<00:01:07.380> that

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
high seed you you're playing not that

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.200 
high seed you you're playing not that
great<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.950> team<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.760> makes<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.090> lot

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
great of a team and it makes it a lot

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.090 
great of a team and it makes it a lot
easier<00:01:09.270> for<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.930> qualify<00:01:10.350> so<00:01:10.770> let's<00:01:10.979> get

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
easier for you to qualify so let's get

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.350 
easier for you to qualify so let's get
right<00:01:11.220> into<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.549> I'm<00:01:11.820> gonna<00:01:11.909> just<00:01:12.060> skip<00:01:12.240> the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
right into it I'm gonna just skip the

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.060 
right into it I'm gonna just skip the
entire<00:01:12.600> first<00:01:12.840> round<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.409> don't<00:01:13.860> really<00:01:13.950> see

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
entire first round I don't really see

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.219 
entire first round I don't really see
any<00:01:14.369> upsets<00:01:14.729> happening<00:01:15.180> any<00:01:15.420> major<00:01:15.720> upsets

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229

happening from any of like the top 10

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.850 
happening from any of like the top 10
seeds<00:01:18.630> they<00:01:19.049> should<00:01:19.229> all<00:01:19.350> win<00:01:19.500> their<00:01:19.619> first

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
seeds they should all win their first

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.700 
seeds they should all win their first
round<00:01:20.130> match<00:01:20.310> pretty<00:01:21.090> easily<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:22.530> I

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
round match pretty easily and I I

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.560 
round match pretty easily and I I
couldn't<00:01:23.400> really<00:01:23.490> see<00:01:23.670> any<00:01:23.820> time<00:01:23.939> losing<00:01:24.270> the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
couldn't really see any time losing the

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.510 
couldn't really see any time losing the
second<00:01:25.020> round<00:01:25.110> there<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.530> few<00:01:25.920> matchups<00:01:26.340> to

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
second round there is a few matchups to

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.060 
second round there is a few matchups to
look<00:01:26.670> at<00:01:27.049> obviously<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.080> think<00:01:28.560> optics<00:01:28.890> gonna

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
look at obviously I think optics gonna

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.340 
look at obviously I think optics gonna
win<00:01:29.189> there<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.430> easily<00:01:29.850> ck<00:01:30.270> does<00:01:30.570> play<00:01:30.780> SB<00:01:31.200> in

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
win there is easily ck does play SB in

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.420 
win there is easily ck does play SB in
the<00:01:31.439> second<00:01:31.770> round<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:32.040> could<00:01:32.340> be

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
the second round that could be

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.240 
the second round that could be

easily<00:01:45.689> opticnation<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.770> gonna<00:01:46.920> play<00:01:47.040> stunner

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
easily opticnation is gonna play stunner

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.980 
easily opticnation is gonna play stunner
but<00:01:47.579> it's<00:01:47.729> not<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.880> same<00:01:48.180> actual<00:01:48.689> stunner

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
but it's not the same actual stunner

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.389 
but it's not the same actual stunner
team<00:01:49.200> they<00:01:49.380> had<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.619> make<00:01:49.740> their<00:01:49.799> adjustments

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
team they had to make their adjustments

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.310 
team they had to make their adjustments
for<00:01:50.520> age<00:01:50.729> limits<00:01:51.090> for<00:01:51.240> champs<00:01:51.630> some<00:01:51.960> give<00:01:52.170> that

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
for age limits for champs some give that

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.580 
for age limits for champs some give that
one<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.500> nation<00:01:53.040> now<00:01:53.549> we<00:01:54.390> have<00:01:54.540> denials<00:01:55.200> gonna

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
one to nation now we have denials gonna

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.130 
one to nation now we have denials gonna
play<00:01:55.860> probably<00:01:56.219> revenge<00:01:56.939> denial<00:01:57.600> with<00:01:57.899> net

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
play probably revenge denial with net

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.069 
play probably revenge denial with net
and<00:01:58.610> phase<00:01:59.610> blacks<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.119> play<00:02:00.270> rise<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:01.020> I

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
and phase blacks and play rise and I

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.289 
and phase blacks and play rise and I
think<00:02:01.290> face<00:02:01.530> black<00:02:01.829> should<00:02:02.549> win<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:02.969> one<00:02:03.149> as

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
think face black should win that one as

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.120 
think face black should win that one as
well<00:02:03.329> now<00:02:04.049> we<00:02:04.110> get<00:02:04.290> into<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.710> third<00:02:05.100> round

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
well now we get into the third round

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.770 
well now we get into the third round
this<00:02:05.520> is<00:02:05.700> worse<00:02:05.880> this<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.360> where<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.509> starts<00:02:06.750> to

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
this is worse this is where it starts to

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.990 
this is worse this is where it starts to
get<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:06.930> little<00:02:06.990> interesting<00:02:07.560> we<00:02:08.429> have<00:02:08.520> optic

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
get a little interesting we have optic

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.839 
get a little interesting we have optic
vs.<00:02:09.390> TK<00:02:09.989> now<00:02:10.470> at<00:02:10.619> this<00:02:10.770> point<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.280> only<00:02:11.310> only

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
vs. TK now at this point the only only

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.160 
vs. TK now at this point the only only
time<00:02:12.030> i<00:02:12.060> Opteka<00:02:12.450> really<00:02:12.660> loses

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
time i Opteka really loses

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.780 
time i Opteka really loses
and<00:02:13.230> they<00:02:13.380> they're<00:02:13.680> not<00:02:13.709> warmed<00:02:14.130> up<00:02:14.340> I<00:02:14.550> guess

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
and they they're not warmed up I guess

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.580 
and they they're not warmed up I guess
you<00:02:14.910> could<00:02:14.970> say<00:02:15.270> you<00:02:15.510> know<00:02:15.630> but<00:02:15.870> once<00:02:16.200> optic

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
you could say you know but once optic

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.699 
you could say you know but once optic
gets<00:02:16.800> momentum<00:02:17.150> that's<00:02:18.150> when<00:02:18.480> their<00:02:18.709> dominant

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
gets momentum that's when their dominant

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.080 
gets momentum that's when their dominant
so<00:02:19.890> at<00:02:19.980> this<00:02:20.069> point<00:02:20.280> they've<00:02:20.489> already<00:02:20.670> beat<00:02:20.940> up

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
so at this point they've already beat up

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.180 
so at this point they've already beat up
to<00:02:21.360> like<00:02:21.630> kind<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:21.959> I<00:02:22.170> don't<00:02:22.530> want<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:22.860> say<00:02:22.920> bad

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
to like kind of I don't want to say bad

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.320 
to like kind of I don't want to say bad
cuz<00:02:23.489> I<00:02:23.520> mean<00:02:23.670> obviously<00:02:23.790> made<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.270> to

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
cuz I mean obviously made it to

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.210 
cuz I mean obviously made it to
regionals<00:02:24.510> but<00:02:24.959> you<00:02:25.349> know<00:02:25.440> not<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.980> best

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
regionals but you know not the best

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.680 
regionals but you know not the best
teams<00:02:26.550> at<00:02:26.849> this<00:02:27.000> point<00:02:27.270> so<00:02:27.390> they're<00:02:27.540> already

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
teams at this point so they're already

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.320 
teams at this point so they're already
warmed<00:02:27.989> up<00:02:28.140> should<00:02:28.920> already<00:02:29.099> be<00:02:29.250> on<00:02:29.370> a<00:02:29.550> roll<00:02:29.790> 12

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
warmed up should already be on a roll 12

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.110 
warmed up should already be on a roll 12
series<00:02:30.780> qualified<00:02:31.739> should<00:02:32.130> be<00:02:32.250> happy<00:02:32.580> I<00:02:32.760> see

k's and 5 k's and shit i'm just trying
to<00:02:46.709> base<00:02:46.860> this<00:02:47.040> on<00:02:47.220> land<00:02:47.459> performance<00:02:47.940> I<00:02:48.150> don't

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
to base this on land performance I don't

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.300 
to base this on land performance I don't
really<00:02:48.660> give<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:48.900> fuck<00:02:48.930> who<00:02:49.500> wins<00:02:49.709> a<00:02:49.800> to<00:02:49.950> care<00:02:50.160> of

really give a fuck who wins a to care of

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.250 
really give a fuck who wins a to care of
I<00:02:50.430> hear<00:02:50.670> that<00:02:50.760> means<00:02:51.150> nothing<00:02:51.510> so<00:02:51.720> anyways<00:02:52.049> um

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
I hear that means nothing so anyways um

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.640 
I hear that means nothing so anyways um
I<00:02:52.680> think<00:02:52.860> NV<00:02:53.310> has<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.760> roster<00:02:54.239> to<00:02:54.750> probably

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
I think NV has the roster to probably

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.800 
I think NV has the roster to probably
the<00:02:55.830> second<00:02:56.459> or<00:02:56.549> third<00:02:56.610> best<00:02:57.000> roster<00:02:57.420> on<00:02:57.569> paper

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
the second or third best roster on paper

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.530 
the second or third best roster on paper
you<00:02:58.560> know<00:02:58.680> along<00:02:59.040> with<00:02:59.100> phase<00:02:59.549> read<00:02:59.819> optic<00:03:00.360> and

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
maybe obligation so I'm giving this to

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.729 
maybe obligation so I'm giving this to
envy<00:03:03.120> I<00:03:03.150> think<00:03:03.480> prof<00:03:03.870> as<00:03:04.140> good<00:03:04.500> as<00:03:04.590> they<00:03:04.709> are

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
envy I think prof as good as they are

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.320 
envy I think prof as good as they are
they<00:03:04.890> just<00:03:05.130> they<00:03:05.459> don't<00:03:05.489> have<00:03:05.760> what<00:03:06.000> it<00:03:06.030> takes

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
they just they don't have what it takes

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.360 
they just they don't have what it takes
to<00:03:06.420> be<00:03:06.450> anga<00:03:06.810> I<00:03:06.959> really<00:03:07.350> like<00:03:07.470> this<00:03:07.590> MV<00:03:07.830> roster

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
to be anga I really like this MV roster

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.850 
to be anga I really like this MV roster
they<00:03:09.299> got<00:03:09.420> a<00:03:09.450> lot<00:03:09.600> of<00:03:09.660> slang<00:03:09.989> on<00:03:10.170> there<00:03:10.350> so<00:03:10.620> I

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
they got a lot of slang on there so I

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.380 
they got a lot of slang on there so I
think<00:03:11.010> they<00:03:11.220> should<00:03:11.640> do<00:03:11.790> pretty<00:03:11.940> well<00:03:12.180> I<00:03:12.239> think

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
think they should do pretty well I think

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.050 
think they should do pretty well I think
that's<00:03:12.600> a<00:03:12.690> top-four<00:03:13.319> team<00:03:13.560> so<00:03:14.100> anyways<00:03:14.459> MV<00:03:14.880> i

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
that's a top-four team so anyways MV i

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.670 
that's a top-four team so anyways MV i
got<00:03:15.120> them<00:03:15.450> over<00:03:15.540> prof<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.230> now<00:03:16.410> we're<00:03:16.560> gonna

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
got them over prof and now we're gonna

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.300 
got them over prof and now we're gonna

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
have phase read verse is opticnation

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.030 
have phase read verse is opticnation
this<00:03:21.239> one<00:03:21.480> it's<00:03:22.049> hard<00:03:22.260> for<00:03:22.440> me<00:03:22.500> to<00:03:22.590> pick<00:03:22.829> I

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.819 
this one it's hard for me to pick I
would<00:03:23.100> want<00:03:23.760> opticnation<00:03:24.450> to<00:03:24.870> win<00:03:25.049> this<00:03:25.260> but<00:03:25.769> I

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
would want opticnation to win this but I

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.310

player<00:03:58.680> in<00:03:58.709> the<00:03:58.829> game<00:03:58.890> so<00:03:59.730> they<00:04:00.150> should<00:04:00.420> win

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
but at the same time I think denounced a

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:04.970 
but at the same time I think denounced a
better<00:04:03.540> team<00:04:03.810> so<00:04:04.230> i'ma<00:04:04.410> give<00:04:04.530> it<00:04:04.560> to<00:04:04.680> denial

maybe not yeah I mean it kind of did I

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.990 
maybe not yeah I mean it kind of did I
don't<00:04:36.960> know<00:04:37.050> well<00:04:37.289> maybe<00:04:37.800> not<00:04:37.949> i<00:04:38.009> guess<00:04:38.280> um<00:04:38.550> but

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
don't know well maybe not i guess um but

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.939 
don't know well maybe not i guess um but
opticians<00:04:39.870> versus<00:04:40.229> denial<00:04:40.560> I<00:04:40.740> like

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
opticians versus denial I like

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:42.950 
opticians versus denial I like
opticnation<00:04:41.310> in<00:04:41.729> that<00:04:41.849> one<00:04:42.030> I<00:04:42.060> think<00:04:42.419> that<00:04:42.780> you

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
opticnation in that one I think that you

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.409 
opticnation in that one I think that you
know<00:04:43.050> if<00:04:43.199> I<00:04:43.409> think<00:04:43.620> honestly<00:04:43.889> the<00:04:44.759> the<00:04:45.180> real

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
know if I think honestly the the real

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:46.790 
know if I think honestly the the real
match<00:04:45.689> up<00:04:45.960> in<00:04:46.080> the<00:04:46.169> bottom<00:04:46.349> side<00:04:46.650> of<00:04:46.680> that

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
match up in the bottom side of that

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.279 
match up in the bottom side of that
brackets<00:04:47.219> opticnation<00:04:47.610> verse<00:04:48.060> phase<00:04:48.389> and<00:04:48.780> you

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:49.289 
brackets opticnation verse phase and you

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.080 
brackets opticnation verse phase and you
know<00:04:49.409> if<00:04:49.620> they<00:04:49.830> can<00:04:49.889> beat<00:04:50.159> them<00:04:50.400> i<00:04:50.460> think<00:04:50.699> you

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
know if they can beat them i think you

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.339 
know if they can beat them i think you
know<00:04:51.120> they<00:04:51.330> should<00:04:51.539> be<00:04:51.629> able<00:04:51.719> to<00:04:51.870> be<00:04:51.990> denial

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:52.349 
know they should be able to be denial

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:54.170 
know they should be able to be denial
easily<00:04:52.800> so<00:04:53.069> I'm<00:04:53.340> gonna<00:04:53.490> give<00:04:53.610> optimization<00:04:54.120> to

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
easily so I'm gonna give optimization to

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.429 
easily so I'm gonna give optimization to
win<00:04:54.330> over<00:04:54.479> that<00:04:54.629> I<00:04:54.659> think<00:04:54.930> if<00:04:55.050> they<00:04:55.199> can<00:04:55.349> be

00:04:55.429 --> 00:04:55.439 
win over that I think if they can be

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:56.480 
win over that I think if they can be
phased<00:04:55.710> and<00:04:55.919> they're<00:04:56.039> definitely<00:04:56.159> gonna<00:04:56.370> be

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
phased and they're definitely gonna be

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:57.860 
phased and they're definitely gonna be
denial<00:04:56.879> and<00:04:57.090> they're<00:04:57.300> gonna<00:04:57.360> go<00:04:57.659> to<00:04:57.719> the

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
denial and they're gonna go to the

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.450 
denial and they're gonna go to the
finals<00:04:58.319> and<00:04:58.409> play<00:04:58.590> off<00:04:58.740> the<00:04:58.889> gaint<00:04:59.189> well

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
finals and play off the gaint well

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.769 
finals and play off the gaint well
winners<00:05:00.000> finals<00:05:00.240> and<00:05:00.509> then<00:05:00.629> obviously

00:05:00.769 --> 00:05:00.779 
winners finals and then obviously

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:02.300 
winners finals and then obviously
someone's<00:05:01.259> gonna<00:05:01.319> come<00:05:01.590> out<00:05:01.680> of<00:05:01.800> losers<00:05:02.099> I

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
someone's gonna come out of losers I

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.219 
someone's gonna come out of losers I
think<00:05:02.789> phase<00:05:03.000> red<00:05:03.270> or<00:05:03.479> envy<00:05:03.779> will<00:05:03.900> come<00:05:04.050> out<00:05:04.139> of

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
think phase red or envy will come out of

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:06.230 
think phase red or envy will come out of
losers<00:05:04.529> once<00:05:05.279> they<00:05:05.430> lose<00:05:05.610> that<00:05:05.669> can<00:05:05.939> come<00:05:06.090> back

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
losers once they lose that can come back

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.540 
losers once they lose that can come back
and<00:05:06.539> maybe<00:05:06.810> make<00:05:07.020> it<00:05:07.050> back<00:05:07.319> into<00:05:07.500> finals<00:05:07.979> but<00:05:08.250> I

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
and maybe make it back into finals but I

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.790 
and maybe make it back into finals but I
mean<00:05:09.150> overall<00:05:09.449> I'm<00:05:10.020> gonna<00:05:10.259> have<00:05:10.409> to<00:05:10.529> predict

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
mean overall I'm gonna have to predict

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.350 
mean overall I'm gonna have to predict
top<00:05:10.949> the<00:05:11.099> gaming<00:05:11.370> to<00:05:11.430> win<00:05:11.639> I<00:05:11.879> mean<00:05:12.060> this<00:05:12.150> is

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
top the gaming to win I mean this is

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.600 
top the gaming to win I mean this is
just<00:05:12.389> there<00:05:13.050> there's<00:05:13.680> really<00:05:14.129> that's<00:05:14.340> just

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
just there there's really that's just

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.339 
just there there's really that's just
the<00:05:14.699> smartest<00:05:15.120> prediction<00:05:15.539> who<00:05:15.810> I'd<00:05:15.960> like<00:05:16.169> to

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:16.349 
the smartest prediction who I'd like to

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:19.010 
the smartest prediction who I'd like to
win<00:05:16.529> opticnation<00:05:17.129> who<00:05:17.939> I<00:05:18.000> think<00:05:18.090> will<00:05:18.479> win<00:05:18.750> up

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
win opticnation who I think will win up

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.170 
win opticnation who I think will win up
to<00:05:19.080> gaming<00:05:19.770> teams<00:05:20.219> that<00:05:20.520> have<00:05:20.610> the<00:05:20.759> potential

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
to gaming teams that have the potential

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.570 
to gaming teams that have the potential
to<00:05:21.389> win<00:05:21.479> off<00:05:21.900> the<00:05:22.080> gaming<00:05:22.560> opticnation<00:05:22.889> phase

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
to win off the gaming opticnation phase

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.510 
to win off the gaming opticnation phase
red<00:05:23.909> or<00:05:24.180> envy<00:05:25.020> I<00:05:25.289> think<00:05:25.680> those<00:05:25.889> one<00:05:26.400> of<00:05:26.430> those

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
red or envy I think those one of those

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.040 
red or envy I think those one of those
four<00:05:26.849> teams<00:05:27.060> should<00:05:27.330> win<00:05:27.539> if<00:05:27.659> another<00:05:27.870> team

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
four teams should win if another team

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.689 
four teams should win if another team
besides<00:05:28.229> those<00:05:28.590> for<00:05:28.889> when<00:05:29.039> I'll<00:05:29.219> be<00:05:29.340> very
