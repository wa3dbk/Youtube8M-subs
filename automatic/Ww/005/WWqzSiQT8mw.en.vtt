aesthetics he said oh you know I liked
your<00:01:40.710> bikes<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.159> booth<00:01:42.140> just<00:01:43.140> build<00:01:43.770> me

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
your bikes in the booth just build me

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.530 
your bikes in the booth just build me
something<00:01:44.070> special<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:45.180> don't<00:01:45.390> like

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.649 
something special and I don't like
purple<00:01:45.930> so<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:47.490> we've<00:01:48.030> been<00:01:48.150> talking<00:01:48.330> about

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
purple so so we've been talking about

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.570 
purple so so we've been talking about
the<00:01:48.960> process<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.380> we<00:01:49.560> use<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.920> build<00:01:50.340> bikes

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
the process that we use to build bikes

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.280 
the process that we use to build bikes
is<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.820> painting<00:01:51.150> process<00:01:51.479> where<00:01:51.869> we<00:01:51.900> pin<00:01:52.170> the

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
is a painting process where we pin the

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.410 
is a painting process where we pin the
tubes<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.740> lugs<00:01:53.040> with<00:01:53.909> normally

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
tubes to the lugs with normally

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.450 
tubes to the lugs with normally
stainless<00:01:54.780> steel<00:01:54.930> pins<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.530> then<00:01:56.040> polished

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
stainless steel pins and then polished

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.039 
stainless steel pins and then polished
and<00:01:56.580> you<00:01:56.640> don't<00:01:56.790> really<00:01:56.970> see<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.240> pins<00:01:57.479> but

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
and you don't really see the pins but

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.810 
and you don't really see the pins but
with<00:01:58.229> this<00:01:58.350> bike<00:01:58.560> we<00:01:58.710> used<00:01:58.890> bronze<00:01:59.190> pins<00:01:59.610> and

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
with this bike we used bronze pins and

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.880 
with this bike we used bronze pins and
it<00:01:59.909> leaves<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.390> clear<00:02:00.810> mark<00:02:01.110> where<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.409> pin<00:02:01.680> was

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
it leaves a clear mark where the pin was

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.310 
it leaves a clear mark where the pin was
it's<00:02:02.250> bronze<00:02:02.549> color<00:02:03.420> with<00:02:03.720> a<00:02:03.750> little<00:02:04.020> patina

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
it's bronze color with a little patina

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.950 
it's bronze color with a little patina
on<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.860> then<00:02:05.310> that's<00:02:05.520> what<00:02:05.729> inspired<00:02:05.960> the

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
on it and then that's what inspired the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.469 
on it and then that's what inspired the
paint<00:02:07.170> color<00:02:07.380> as<00:02:07.590> well<00:02:07.619> so<00:02:08.129> it's

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
paint color as well so it's

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.330 
paint color as well so it's
kind<00:02:08.599> of<00:02:08.659> bronze<00:02:09.729> bronzy<00:02:10.729> color<00:02:10.940> ride<00:02:11.480> right

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
kind of bronze bronzy color ride right

a bit of time to achieve this this
beautiful<00:02:50.239> luster<00:02:50.569> yeah<00:02:51.019> i<00:02:51.470> think<00:02:51.650> i've

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
beautiful luster yeah i think i've

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
started get the feeling back in my

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:55.599 
started get the feeling back in my
fingers<00:02:54.410> and<00:02:54.560> i'm<00:02:54.920> working<00:02:55.190> on<00:02:55.250> this<00:02:55.370> bike

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:55.609 
fingers and i'm working on this bike

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:58.000 
fingers and i'm working on this bike
yeah<00:02:56.209> well<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.810> first<00:02:57.079> step<00:02:57.140> in<00:02:57.440> the<00:02:57.560> process

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
yeah well the first step in the process

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.380 
yeah well the first step in the process
is<00:02:58.250> to<00:02:58.519> get<00:02:58.640> the<00:02:58.760> loves<00:02:58.940> to<00:02:59.060> be<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.269> right

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
is to get the loves to be the right

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.349 
is to get the loves to be the right
shape<00:02:59.720> so<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.470> hugs<00:03:01.160> as<00:03:01.340> cast<00:03:01.700> are<00:03:01.910> often<00:03:02.150> kind

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
shape so the hugs as cast are often kind

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:03.610 
shape so the hugs as cast are often kind
of<00:03:02.420> wavy<00:03:02.629> and<00:03:02.780> if<00:03:02.900> you<00:03:02.959> just<00:03:03.140> polish<00:03:03.410> that<00:03:03.560> up

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
of wavy and if you just polish that up

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.140 
of wavy and if you just polish that up
they<00:03:03.859> look<00:03:04.069> bad<00:03:04.250> so<00:03:04.489> we<00:03:04.640> start<00:03:04.819> off<00:03:04.940> with<00:03:05.120> a

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
they look bad so we start off with a

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.869 
they look bad so we start off with a
file<00:03:05.510> just<00:03:06.349> a<00:03:06.500> hand<00:03:06.739> file<00:03:06.980> make<00:03:07.370> the<00:03:07.519> lugs<00:03:07.700> all

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:07.879 
file just a hand file make the lugs all

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:09.339 
file just a hand file make the lugs all
the<00:03:08.060> right<00:03:08.209> shape<00:03:08.510> and<00:03:08.690> then<00:03:09.140> of<00:03:09.319> course

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
the right shape and then of course

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:10.990 
the right shape and then of course
they're<00:03:09.859> not<00:03:09.890> smooth<00:03:10.340> and<00:03:10.489> shiny<00:03:10.609> when<00:03:10.910> you

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
they're not smooth and shiny when you

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.789 
they're not smooth and shiny when you
get<00:03:11.120> done<00:03:11.209> filing<00:03:11.720> so<00:03:12.170> then<00:03:12.379> we<00:03:12.470> go<00:03:12.620> out<00:03:12.769> and

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
get done filing so then we go out and

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.949 
get done filing so then we go out and
with<00:03:12.980> sandpaper<00:03:13.400> and<00:03:13.760> it's<00:03:14.030> a<00:03:14.209> it's<00:03:14.599> actually

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
with sandpaper and it's a it's actually

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.420 
with sandpaper and it's a it's actually
