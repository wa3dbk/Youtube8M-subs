00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:17.570
In this clip, I'm going to show you how to
add chapter markers to your movie, using Garage

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.570
Band. Now, Garage Band is included with ILife08,
so if you have IDVD, and IMovie, you have

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.500
Garage Band, so open up a new music project
in Garage Band. You'll see this window, that

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:35.860
we're looking at here. As I said before, Garage
Band is primarily a music creation and editing

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.420
application, but it does do other things,
and one of those things it does, is it works

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.130
with video, and movie files. Now, the way
you access those, are down here in the bottom

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.769
right hand corner, you have this little icon
that shows, what looks like a film strip,

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:49.890
a musical note, and a photo. This reveals,
if you click on it, it reveals your media

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:59.630
browser, which looks very similar to the media
browser in IDVD, so you go to Movies. We can

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:05.030
see our El's Wedding movie that's here. We
can play through it here in the viewer, to

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.270
make sure we have the right movie. Let's pause
it. We don't really need that right now, and

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:17.660
what we want to do, is add it to our project,
by just dragging it over, to where it says

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:26.070
tracks. Now, Garage Band will create thumbnails,
similar to the way IMovie does. This allows

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:34.660
you to scroll to the movie, somewhat to the
way you scrub through a movie in IMovie, so

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.660
now we see that we have a movie track. We
have the sound that's associated with that

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:41.439
movie, the audio, and we still have our grand
piano track. We really don't need this track

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:42.439
at all, because we're not going to be using
it, so let's just delete that, to give ourselves

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:50.299
more room. Now the way you add chapter markers,
is you have your little play head up here,

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.586
that you can grab with your mouse, and drag.
You want to drag it to the beginning, of where

00:01:55.586 --> 00:02:02.060
you would like to add a chapter marker, so
I'm going to add one, right at the beginning

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.590
of this project, right before it fades up.
So we'll kind of eliminate this ten seconds

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.700
of black, that we have here. When you're happy
with where the chapter marker is, you want

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:16.940
to go to Edit. Add marker, or you can hit,
just the letter P. Once you do that, it opens

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:24.269
up another window, and this is where you can
actually view, and edit your markers. It shows

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:30.150
you that you have a marker here, timed at
nine seconds, and it's marked as a chapter,

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.340
so let's choose another one, by scrubbing
through our footage. Let's put one right at

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.220
the beginning of, right at the beginning of
where the vowels start, so we have it there.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.550
Now, that we have this window open, we don't
have to hit Edit, add marker, or P. We can

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.430
hit the add marker down here, below. It shows
our new marker is at twenty seconds, so this

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.600
is a way you can put a marker, exactly where
you want it, and I'm just going to add one

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:05.331
more, for this example, and we'll add that
at the beginning of the cake cutting here.

00:03:05.331 --> 00:03:12.970
Go to the beginning of the cake cutting here,
and let's hit Add marker. Now, once we have

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.000
all of our markers set up the way we like,and
we want to export this movie, so we can use

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.359
it in IDVD. Now, if we go up to where it says
share. You see that it has an option to send

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:25.739
movie to IDVD. If we do this however, IDVD
will open up a new project, with this movie

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.310
in it, and sometimes it's a good way to do
it this way. I prefer to export the movie

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.700
to disc, and then bring it into IMovie. Let's
export it to disc. You get this window, which

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.079
allows you to set the video settings. We always
want to use full quality, if we're going to

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.540
be using IDVD. We can export, and now we can
choose where we want to put it. I'm going

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.299
to put it in our movies folder, and I'm going
to call it El's Wedding with Chapters, and

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:42.760
let's hit save.
