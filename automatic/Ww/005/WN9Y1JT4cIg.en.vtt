00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
getting the thing up and running this

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.260 
getting the thing up and running this
will<00:00:52.710> work<00:00:52.860> right<00:00:53.219> out<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.610> box<00:00:53.789> just<00:00:54.000> pull

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
will work right out of the box just pull

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.840 
will work right out of the box just pull
out<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.600> even<00:00:54.870> has<00:00:54.989> 16<00:00:55.440> gigs<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:56.010> memory<00:00:56.160> built

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
out it even has 16 gigs of memory built

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.720 
out it even has 16 gigs of memory built
in<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:57.840> already<00:00:58.559> have<00:00:58.770> tons<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.460> storage

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
in so you already have tons of storage

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.580 
in so you already have tons of storage
on<00:01:00.000> board<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.750> then<00:01:00.899> if<00:01:00.989> you'd<00:01:01.079> like<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.440> you

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
on board and then if you'd like to you

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.399 
on board and then if you'd like to you
can<00:01:01.620> add<00:01:01.770> even<00:01:02.160> more<00:01:02.280> by<00:01:03.120> adding<00:01:03.600> an<00:01:03.780> SD<00:01:04.260> or

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
can add even more by adding an SD or

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.039 
can add even more by adding an SD or
SDHC<00:01:05.159> card<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:05.820> can<00:01:06.030> literally<00:01:06.479> expand

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
SDHC card so you can literally expand

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.200 
SDHC card so you can literally expand
this<00:01:07.200> as<00:01:07.439> far<00:01:07.799> as<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.130> want<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:08.640> once<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:08.970> fill

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
this as far as you want so once you fill

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.730 
this as far as you want so once you fill
up<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.390> memory<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.960> can<00:01:10.080> just<00:01:10.229> keep<00:01:10.380> swapping

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
up the memory you can just keep swapping

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.859 
up the memory you can just keep swapping
out<00:01:10.979> SD<00:01:11.400> cards<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.090> never<00:01:12.270> have<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.570> worry

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
out SD cards so you never have to worry

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.950 
out SD cards so you never have to worry
about<00:01:12.990> running<00:01:13.409> out<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.770> space<00:01:14.189> ever<00:01:14.600> it<00:01:15.600> does

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
about running out of space ever it does

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.050 
about running out of space ever it does
