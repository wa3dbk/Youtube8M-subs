00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
running again a couple days ago but it's

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.570 
running again a couple days ago but it's
been<00:00:08.040> hanging<00:00:08.460> up<00:00:08.580> in<00:00:09.710> neutral<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:10.889> revving

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
been hanging up in neutral and revving

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.459 
been hanging up in neutral and revving
up<00:00:11.700> quite<00:00:11.940> a<00:00:11.969> bit<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.300> then<00:00:12.450> in<00:00:12.690> first<00:00:13.080> gear<00:00:13.320> as

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
up quite a bit and then in first gear as

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.799 
up quite a bit and then in first gear as
well<00:00:13.500> like<00:00:14.460> all<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.790> gears<00:00:15.000> it<00:00:15.179> just<00:00:15.360> pulls<00:00:15.630> on

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
well like all the gears it just pulls on

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.330 
well like all the gears it just pulls on
its<00:00:15.960> own<00:00:16.109> quite<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.650> bit<00:00:18.470> then<00:00:19.470> it<00:00:19.619> revs<00:00:19.800> up<00:00:19.980> to

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
its own quite a bit then it revs up to

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.359 
its own quite a bit then it revs up to
pulling<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.670> clutch<00:00:20.880> in<00:00:21.090> gear<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:22.250> then<00:00:23.250> if

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
pulling the clutch in gear and then if

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.710 
pulling the clutch in gear and then if
you<00:00:23.460> don't<00:00:23.640> you're<00:00:24.210> pulling<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.570> clutch

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
you don't you're pulling the clutch

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.870 
you don't you're pulling the clutch
after<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.140> while<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.920> will<00:00:25.980> bog<00:00:26.189> down<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.820> you

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
after a while it will bog down and you

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.370 
after a while it will bog down and you
got<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.090> get<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.210> guess<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.630> keep<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:27.900> running<00:00:28.019> I

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
got to get a guess to keep it running I

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.980 
got to get a guess to keep it running I
try<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.340> jump<00:00:29.670> some<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.939> bottle<00:00:30.330> stop<00:00:30.539> right

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
try to jump some the bottle stop right

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.380 
try to jump some the bottle stop right
there<00:00:31.460> but<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:33.030> did<00:00:33.570> quite<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.840> bit<00:00:33.960> for<00:00:34.350> not<00:00:35.160> now

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
there but it did quite a bit for not now

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.120 
there but it did quite a bit for not now
still<00:00:36.780> hanging<00:00:37.110> up<00:00:37.200> in<00:00:37.290> here<00:00:37.620> she's<00:00:37.950> got<00:00:38.070> a

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.130 
still hanging up in here she's got a

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.840 
still hanging up in here she's got a
lower<00:00:38.340> idle<00:00:38.760> now

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
lower idle now

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.530 
lower idle now
I've<00:00:41.300> tried<00:00:41.810> checking<00:00:42.290> their<00:00:42.440> air<00:00:43.220> boot<00:00:43.520> for<00:00:44.030> a

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
I've tried checking their air boot for a

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.620 
I've tried checking their air boot for a
vacuum<00:00:45.230> leak<00:00:45.590> but<00:00:45.740> I<00:00:45.800> didn't<00:00:45.980> really<00:00:46.070> see<00:00:46.160> one

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:46.630 
vacuum leak but I didn't really see one

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:54.380 
vacuum leak but I didn't really see one
so<00:00:47.630> you<00:00:47.690> guys<00:00:47.840> have<00:00:47.990> any<00:00:48.170> ideas<00:00:49.720> hit<00:00:50.720> me<00:00:50.840> up

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.800 

which<00:00:54.480> office<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.140> it

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:56.810 
which office in it

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:13.530 
which office in it
steel<00:00:57.290> savers<00:00:57.740> detective<00:00:58.160> stuck<00:00:58.370> on<00:00:58.550> you

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.149 

I'll<00:01:13.900> start<00:01:14.320> it<00:01:14.409> up<00:01:14.530> and<00:01:14.710> see<00:01:14.890> if<00:01:14.979> you<00:01:15.040> can

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
I'll start it up and see if you can

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.510 
I'll start it up and see if you can
prepare<00:01:15.430> the<00:01:15.550> problem<00:01:15.940> I'm<00:01:16.030> not<00:01:16.180> sure<00:01:16.420> but

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
prepare the problem I'm not sure but

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.290 
prepare the problem I'm not sure but
maybe<00:01:18.520> I'll<00:01:18.729> take<00:01:18.880> it<00:01:19.000> up<00:01:19.060> and<00:01:19.120> down<00:01:19.210> the

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
maybe I'll take it up and down the

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.410 
maybe I'll take it up and down the
street<00:01:19.540> to<00:01:19.720> eat<00:01:19.870> here<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:21.670> likes<00:01:21.970> to<00:01:22.119> pull<00:01:22.300> in

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
street to eat here it likes to pull in

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.280 
street to eat here it likes to pull in
first<00:01:22.630> gear

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
first gear

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.760 
first gear
weird<00:01:23.770> first<00:01:24.159> second<00:01:24.700> third<00:01:24.940> I<00:01:25.590> just<00:01:26.590> put<00:01:26.740> a

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
weird first second third I just put a

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.800 
weird first second third I just put a
new<00:01:26.950> power<00:01:27.640> valve<00:01:27.850> linkage<00:01:28.180> arm<00:01:28.360> in<00:01:28.570> it<00:01:28.690> as

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
new power valve linkage arm in it as

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.180 
new power valve linkage arm in it as
well<00:01:28.990> I<00:01:29.729> tried<00:01:30.729> just<00:01:30.759> enough<00:01:31.920> power<00:01:32.920> valve

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
well I tried just enough power valve

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.530 
well I tried just enough power valve
right<00:01:33.460> here<00:01:33.729> but<00:01:33.940> it<00:01:34.030> didn't<00:01:34.240> really<00:01:34.360> do

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
right here but it didn't really do

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.859 
right here but it didn't really do
anything

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
anything

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.640 
anything
so<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:37.600> I'm<00:01:37.659> not<00:01:37.810> really<00:01:38.080> giving<00:01:38.259> it<00:01:38.470> much

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
so so I'm not really giving it much

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.320 
so so I'm not really giving it much
throttle<00:01:38.950> yet<00:01:39.280> because<00:01:39.610> I'm<00:01:39.909> still<00:01:39.970> breaking

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
throttle yet because I'm still breaking

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.280 
throttle yet because I'm still breaking
in<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.659> new<00:01:40.690> piston<00:01:42.659> I'll<00:01:43.659> stick<00:01:44.020> it<00:01:44.080> down<00:01:44.229> in

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
in the new piston I'll stick it down in

00:01:44.290 --> 00:02:25.690 
in the new piston I'll stick it down in
a<00:01:44.500> second

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:55.750 

you

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:30.180 

I'll<00:02:56.760> take<00:02:57.000> it<00:02:57.090> around<00:02:57.180> in<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.420> grass

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190
