Universal movies they all somewhat look

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.940 
Universal movies they all somewhat look
like<00:03:10.060> this<00:03:12.840> we<00:03:13.840> just<00:03:13.870> with<00:03:14.170> the<00:03:14.290> title<00:03:14.740> and

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
like this we just with the title and

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.210 
like this we just with the title and
there's<00:03:15.310> no<00:03:15.400> graphics<00:03:15.850> to<00:03:16.030> it<00:03:16.350> well<00:03:17.350> from<00:03:18.040> the

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
there's no graphics to it well from the

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.330 
there's no graphics to it well from the
movies<00:03:19.350> so<00:03:20.350> that's<00:03:20.560> what<00:03:20.650> you<00:03:20.770> get<00:03:20.890> over<00:03:20.980> here

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
movies so that's what you get over here

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.130 
movies so that's what you get over here
I'm<00:03:22.210> sure<00:03:22.420> some<00:03:22.690> of<00:03:22.720> you<00:03:22.840> guys<00:03:22.930> will<00:03:23.080> be

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
I'm sure some of you guys will be

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.240 
I'm sure some of you guys will be
disappointed<00:03:23.920> but<00:03:25.620> again<00:03:26.620> it<00:03:26.800> gets<00:03:26.950> the<00:03:27.040> job

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
disappointed but again it gets the job

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.990 
disappointed but again it gets the job
done

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.020 

so<00:03:31.000> just<00:03:31.660> unboxing<00:03:35.310> overall<00:03:36.310> I<00:03:36.580> probably<00:03:36.790> give

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
so just unboxing overall I probably give

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:44.210 
so just unboxing overall I probably give
this<00:03:37.350> case<00:03:38.350> a<00:03:39.510> b-minus<00:03:40.510> maybe<00:03:41.500> a<00:03:41.590> B<00:03:42.330> it's<00:03:43.330> good

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
this case a b-minus maybe a B it's good

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.440 
this case a b-minus maybe a B it's good
but<00:03:45.220> I<00:03:45.280> could<00:03:45.460> have<00:03:45.520> been<00:03:45.670> more<00:03:45.880> exciting<00:03:46.420> you

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
but I could have been more exciting you

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.000 
but I could have been more exciting you
know<00:03:46.540> especially<00:03:47.230> since<00:03:47.410> the<00:03:47.500> movie<00:03:47.710> was<00:03:47.920> so

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
know especially since the movie was so

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.860 
know especially since the movie was so
exciting<00:03:48.490> there<00:03:48.640> are<00:03:48.700> some<00:03:48.880> good<00:03:49.420> exciting

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
exciting there are some good exciting

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.870 
exciting there are some good exciting
parts<00:03:51.930> they<00:03:52.930> could<00:03:53.110> have<00:03:53.230> use<00:03:53.980> more<00:03:54.580> of<00:03:54.610> those

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
parts they could have use more of those

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.650 
parts they could have use more of those
itself<00:03:55.570> just<00:03:56.170> making<00:03:56.440> it<00:03:56.530> generic<00:03:57.040> but<00:03:57.660> at

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
itself just making it generic but at

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:59.940 
itself just making it generic but at
least<00:03:58.810> they<00:03:58.960> were<00:03:59.020> thinking<00:03:59.320> of<00:03:59.410> that<00:03:59.620> fan

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
least they were thinking of that fan

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.340 
least they were thinking of that fan
still<00:04:00.250> about<00:04:00.550> it<00:04:00.730> so<00:04:01.030> you<00:04:01.690> can't<00:04:01.870> really<00:04:01.990> fault

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
still about it so you can't really fault

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:09.220 
still about it so you can't really fault
them<00:04:02.410> for<00:04:02.590> that

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.350 

all<00:04:09.800> right<00:04:09.950> so<00:04:10.069> I<00:04:10.099> pop<00:04:10.430> the<00:04:11.440> the<00:04:13.120> moving<00:04:14.120> to<00:04:14.239> my

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
all right so I pop the the moving to my

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.830 
all right so I pop the the moving to my
ps3<00:04:14.660> and<00:04:15.080> I<00:04:15.140> watched<00:04:15.349> some<00:04:15.440> certain<00:04:16.130> scenes<00:04:16.840> so

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
ps3 and I watched some certain scenes so

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.650 
ps3 and I watched some certain scenes so
far<00:04:18.109> first<00:04:18.290> impression<00:04:18.829> video<00:04:19.669> and<00:04:20.299> audio<00:04:20.450> is

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
far first impression video and audio is

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.590 
far first impression video and audio is
really<00:04:20.870> good<00:04:21.139> I<00:04:21.610> watched<00:04:22.610> that<00:04:22.820> action<00:04:23.389> scene

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
really good I watched that action scene

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.469 
really good I watched that action scene
all<00:04:23.870> over<00:04:23.930> the<00:04:24.470> bridge<00:04:24.680> with<00:04:24.860> the<00:04:24.889> tank<00:04:25.220> and

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
all over the bridge with the tank and

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:29.350 
all over the bridge with the tank and
yeah<00:04:26.479> the<00:04:27.050> surround<00:04:27.410> was<00:04:27.590> just<00:04:28.360> mind-blowing

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
yeah the surround was just mind-blowing

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.900 
yeah the surround was just mind-blowing
and<00:04:30.490> video<00:04:31.490> is<00:04:31.639> good<00:04:31.820> to<00:04:32.950> compare<00:04:33.950> to<00:04:34.100> -<00:04:34.669> steel

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
and video is good to compare to - steel

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.010 
and video is good to compare to - steel
I<00:04:35.180> would<00:04:36.139> say<00:04:36.350> this<00:04:36.710> one<00:04:36.950> isn't<00:04:37.310> as<00:04:37.490> good<00:04:38.020> while

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
I would say this one isn't as good while

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.990 
I would say this one isn't as good while
we'll<00:04:39.169> still<00:04:39.200> give<00:04:39.470> it<00:04:39.560> an<00:04:39.680> a<00:04:39.800> -<00:04:40.760> still<00:04:40.910> is

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
we'll still give it an a - still is

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.750 
we'll still give it an a - still is
probably<00:04:41.240> like<00:04:41.389> an<00:04:41.540> 8<00:04:41.720> plus<00:04:41.979> so<00:04:42.979> it's<00:04:43.550> still

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
probably like an 8 plus so it's still

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:44.190 
probably like an 8 plus so it's still
good

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
good

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.219 
good
as<00:04:45.200> far<00:04:45.590> as<00:04:45.620> that<00:04:45.919> extended<00:04:46.780> like<00:04:47.780> they<00:04:48.050> say

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:48.229 
as far as that extended like they say

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:50.469 
as far as that extended like they say
over<00:04:48.470> here<00:04:48.760> I'm<00:04:49.760> not<00:04:49.940> sure<00:04:50.030> if<00:04:50.120> you<00:04:50.180> could<00:04:50.330> read

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 
over here I'm not sure if you could read

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.390 
over here I'm not sure if you could read
it<00:04:50.600> but<00:04:50.780> there's<00:04:51.020> an<00:04:51.139> extended<00:04:51.530> version<00:04:51.740> and<00:04:52.190> a

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
it but there's an extended version and a

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.400 
it but there's an extended version and a
regular<00:04:52.790> version<00:04:53.120> that<00:04:54.020> they<00:04:54.139> have<00:04:54.320> to

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
regular version that they have to

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.490 
regular version that they have to
conversion<00:04:55.330> it's<00:04:56.330> probably<00:04:56.720> not<00:04:56.810> much<00:04:57.050> it's

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
conversion it's probably not much it's

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.620 
conversion it's probably not much it's
only<00:04:57.710> about<00:04:57.889> a<00:04:58.340> minute<00:04:58.940> longer<00:04:59.180> for<00:04:59.540> an

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
only about a minute longer for an

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.670 
only about a minute longer for an
extended<00:05:00.050> version<00:05:00.790> maybe<00:05:01.790> it's<00:05:01.970> more<00:05:02.090> violent

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
extended version maybe it's more violent

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.770 
extended version maybe it's more violent
certain<00:05:03.680> scenes<00:05:03.889> are<00:05:04.010> added<00:05:04.450> but<00:05:05.450> it's<00:05:05.630> not

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
certain scenes are added but it's not

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.090 
certain scenes are added but it's not
like<00:05:05.960> Lord<00:05:06.200> of<00:05:06.290> the<00:05:06.380> Rings<00:05:06.590> you<00:05:06.740> know<00:05:06.919> where

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
like Lord of the Rings you know where

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.719 
like Lord of the Rings you know where
it's<00:05:07.250> extra<00:05:07.910> 45<00:05:08.360> minutes<00:05:08.410> but<00:05:09.410> it's<00:05:10.370> an<00:05:10.490> action

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
it's extra 45 minutes but it's an action

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:15.219 
it's extra 45 minutes but it's an action
flick<00:05:11.830> so<00:05:13.180> we'll<00:05:14.180> take<00:05:14.389> what<00:05:14.510> we<00:05:14.539> can<00:05:14.750> get<00:05:14.990> and

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
flick so we'll take what we can get and

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:17.020 
flick so we'll take what we can get and
we'll<00:05:15.740> see<00:05:15.919> maybe<00:05:16.100> there's<00:05:16.550> more<00:05:16.580> violence

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
we'll see maybe there's more violence

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.320 
we'll see maybe there's more violence
today<00:05:17.180> just<00:05:17.419> like<00:05:17.539> in<00:05:17.690> Fast<00:05:17.960> Five<00:05:19.270> having<00:05:20.270> to
