00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.970
 This man shot Walter Delacroix. He raped Hope Percy and stabbed her 17 times. 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.560
 While he was dictating his sentence he laughed and chewed gum. 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.189
 He is a soulless, perverted, maladapted and it is time ... 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.019
 M.Poncelet has requested that you be their spiritual guide ... 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:33.989
 This boy will be executed in 6 days, do you know what you are getting involved with? 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.989
 They are all liars. You must be very, very careful. 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.550
 Well, Matthew, I did it. Have not you done this before? - No. He had been so close to a murderer? - Not that I'm aware. 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:56.690
 What does a nun do in a place like that? 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:03.990
 I did not kill anyone. I swear to god. Poncelet says that Vitello killed both of them. 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.730
 Ha, they say it was the other one. Somebody lies. Let's talk about that night. 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.620
 I do not want to talk about that. As your friend I want to help you die with 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.659
 dignity, and I do not see how that can happen without you admitting your part in Walter's murder. 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.490
 That trash stole my only son. When you look at leaving your son you never know that 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.570
 It's going to be the last time you'll see it. Do you never think about those guys? 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:30.570
 I want a lie detector so my mom knows that I do not kill kids. 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.020
 How can you sit on Poncelet's side? I like to be with you, it makes me pretty 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.920
 pretty. Death breathes in your neck and you play to make yourself 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.299
 the male. We can still appeal. 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:38.140
 Why were you there that night? I told you I was drugged! 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.960
 Blame the government, the drugs, the blacks. But what about you? 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.420
 It is not a person. It's an animal! I have something to tell your parents. 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.810
 Will you go with words of hate? Dead man Walking! 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.810
 I want the last thing you see to be the face of love. So look at me. 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.590
 No more bars, cells, no more living in a cave! 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.590
 Governor. Please, do not execute this man.
