00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
it's it's EPS non-touch type or so I

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:16.590

screen<00:05:36.180> brightness<00:05:36.390> is<00:05:36.690> about<00:05:36.990> halfway<00:05:37.260> so<00:05:37.970> I

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
screen brightness is about halfway so I

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.230 
screen brightness is about halfway so I
gotta<00:05:39.330> take<00:05:39.480> a<00:05:39.540> picture<00:05:39.690> myself<00:05:40.850> thank<00:05:41.850> God<00:05:42.030> my

nobody<00:05:49.030> must<00:05:49.120> have<00:05:49.300> that<00:05:49.360> I<00:05:49.419> fix<00:05:49.629> it<00:05:49.720> up<00:05:49.810> a

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
nobody must have that I fix it up a

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.689 
nobody must have that I fix it up a
little<00:05:49.930> bit<00:05:50.199> can't<00:05:51.160> take<00:05:51.280> a<00:05:51.340> picture<00:05:51.520> without

Oh terrible

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:20.339 
Oh terrible
okay<00:06:16.279> so<00:06:16.610> I<00:06:16.969> guess<00:06:17.419> it's<00:06:17.629> just<00:06:17.689> a<00:06:17.929> nap<00:06:18.080> done

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:20.349

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.369 

maybe<00:06:31.370> in<00:06:31.490> the<00:06:31.580> future<00:06:31.610> I<00:06:32.000> will<00:06:32.150> load<00:06:32.479> in<00:06:32.660> or

00:06:33.369 --> 00:06:33.379 
maybe in the future I will load in or

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:37.629 
maybe in the future I will load in or
install<00:06:34.060> solid-state<00:06:35.060> drive<00:06:35.509> or<00:06:35.930> a<00:06:36.280> 7200<00:06:37.280> rpm

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:37.639 
install solid-state drive or a 7200 rpm

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:39.430 
install solid-state drive or a 7200 rpm
hard<00:06:37.849> drive<00:06:37.970> which<00:06:38.210> is<00:06:38.240> a<00:06:38.360> very<00:06:38.599> cheap<00:06:38.900> fix

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 
hard drive which is a very cheap fix

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.460 
hard drive which is a very cheap fix
I<00:06:39.470> mean<00:06:39.710> mod<00:06:40.240> most<00:06:41.240> likely<00:06:41.479> he'll<00:06:41.539> do<00:06:41.690> the<00:06:41.780> 7200

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:42.470 
I mean mod most likely he'll do the 7200

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.039 
I mean mod most likely he'll do the 7200
rpm<00:06:42.740> drive
