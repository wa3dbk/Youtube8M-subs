them is a persistent environment where

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.410 
them is a persistent environment where
instead<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.130> each<00:00:26.340> round<00:00:26.670> you<00:00:27.029> save<00:00:27.240> up<00:00:27.390> your

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420

so<00:00:33.120> does<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.600> work<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.230> fun<00:00:35.390> let's<00:00:36.390> find<00:00:36.719> out

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.310 

one<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.600> things<00:00:48.780> you'll<00:00:49.020> notice

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
one of the things you'll notice

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.470 
one of the things you'll notice
immediately<00:00:49.440> upon<00:00:50.370> playing<00:00:50.670> crossfire<00:00:51.329> is

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
immediately upon playing crossfire is

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.630 
immediately upon playing crossfire is
that<00:00:51.719> it's<00:00:51.899> obviously<00:00:52.140> inspired<00:00:52.710> by<00:00:53.160> Counter

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
that it's obviously inspired by Counter

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.240 
that it's obviously inspired by Counter
Strike<00:00:53.670> not<00:00:54.600> counter-strike<00:00:55.350> source<00:00:55.410> though

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
Strike not counter-strike source though

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.360 
Strike not counter-strike source though
with<00:00:56.760> all<00:00:56.940> their<00:00:57.180> fancy<00:00:57.510> graphics<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:59.219> looks

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
with all their fancy graphics it looks

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.779 
with all their fancy graphics it looks
more<00:00:59.550> like<00:00:59.730> counter-strike<00:01:00.059> 1.6<00:01:01.430> the<00:01:02.430> problem

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
more like counter-strike 1.6 the problem

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.640 
more like counter-strike 1.6 the problem
is<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.030> while<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.359> graphics<00:01:03.719> are<00:01:04.199> similar

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
is that while the graphics are similar

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.469 
is that while the graphics are similar
to<00:01:04.830> counter-strike<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.549> netcode<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.240> hit

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
to counter-strike the netcode and hit

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.020 
to counter-strike the netcode and hit
boxes<00:01:06.930> aren't<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.860> game<00:01:08.070> kind<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.610> stinks

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
boxes aren't so the game kind of stinks

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.600 
boxes aren't so the game kind of stinks
if<00:01:09.180> you're<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.360> hardcore<00:01:09.630> gamer<00:01:10.250> the<00:01:11.250> casual

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
if you're a hardcore gamer the casual

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.359 
if you're a hardcore gamer the casual
players<00:01:11.820> it's<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.150> decent<00:01:12.510> game<00:01:12.659> though<00:01:13.250> one<00:01:14.250> of

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
players it's a decent game though one of

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.649 
players it's a decent game though one of
the<00:01:14.460> differences<00:01:14.939> from<00:01:15.090> counter-strike<00:01:15.600> is

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
the differences from counter-strike is

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.420 
the differences from counter-strike is
that<00:01:15.960> there's<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.229> persistent<00:01:16.830> shop<00:01:17.159> outside

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
that there's a persistent shop outside

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.429 
that there's a persistent shop outside
of<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.939> matches<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.600> play<00:01:18.869> where<00:01:19.409> you

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
of the matches that you play where you

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.020 
of the matches that you play where you
can<00:01:19.530> pick<00:01:19.890> out<00:01:19.979> your<00:01:20.189> weapons<00:01:20.580> armor<00:01:21.000> and

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
can pick out your weapons armor and

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.880 
can pick out your weapons armor and
items<00:01:21.540> without<00:01:21.780> actually<00:01:22.229> being<00:01:22.470> in<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.650> game

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
items without actually being in the game

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.070 
items without actually being in the game
so<00:01:23.759> there's<00:01:23.909> seven<00:01:24.150> different<00:01:24.540> modes<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:24.960> this

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
so there's seven different modes in this

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.960 
so there's seven different modes in this

are<00:01:42.060> basically<00:01:42.659> one<00:01:42.930> side<00:01:43.259> has<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.740> plant<00:01:44.009> a

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
are basically one side has to plant a

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.490 
are basically one side has to plant a
bomb<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.549> has<00:01:44.729> stealth<00:01:45.240> abilities<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.990> only

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
bomb and has stealth abilities and only

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.380 
bomb and has stealth abilities and only
knives<00:01:46.770> while<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.520> other<00:01:47.670> side<00:01:47.909> has<00:01:48.180> to

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
knives while the other side has to

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.109 
knives while the other side has to
defend<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:49.079> they<00:01:49.350> have<00:01:49.470> guns<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.790> makes<00:01:50.970> a

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
defend and they have guns so it makes a

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.969 
defend and they have guns so it makes a
little<00:01:51.329> bit<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.600> interesting<00:01:51.869> gameplay<00:01:52.350> but

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
little bit of interesting gameplay but

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.830 
little bit of interesting gameplay but
it's<00:01:53.130> basically<00:01:53.490> just<00:01:53.610> search<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.479> destroy

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
it's basically just search to destroy

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.130 
it's basically just search to destroy
with<00:01:55.140> tweak<00:01:55.409> settings<00:01:56.930> mutation<00:01:57.930> mode

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
with tweak settings mutation mode

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.200 
with tweak settings mutation mode
however<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:58.799> different<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.880> unique

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
however is different and unique

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.920 
however is different and unique
basically<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.380> way<00:02:01.530> mutation<00:02:02.159> mode<00:02:02.340> works<00:02:02.610> is

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
basically the way mutation mode works is

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.200 
basically the way mutation mode works is
one<00:02:03.930> players<00:02:04.229> in<00:02:04.500> mutant<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.100> upon<00:02:05.549> tagging

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
one players in mutant and upon tagging

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.650 
one players in mutant and upon tagging
another<00:02:06.540> player<00:02:06.869> he<00:02:07.320> also<00:02:07.530> becomes<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.190> mutant

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
another player he also becomes a mutant

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.110 
another player he also becomes a mutant
you<00:02:09.350> can<00:02:09.500> see<00:02:09.680> here<00:02:10.040> I<00:02:10.070> was<00:02:10.280> just<00:02:10.310> tagged<00:02:10.910> as<00:02:11.090> a

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120
