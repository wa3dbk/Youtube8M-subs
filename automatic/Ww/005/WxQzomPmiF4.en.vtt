my<00:00:39.110> eyes<00:00:39.850> don't<00:00:40.850> look<00:00:40.940> too<00:00:41.120> bad<00:00:41.150> on<00:00:41.330> things<00:00:42.280> but

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
my eyes don't look too bad on things but

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.630 
my eyes don't look too bad on things but
uh<00:00:44.590> my<00:00:45.590> hair<00:00:45.860> though<00:00:46.040> and<00:00:46.250> I<00:00:46.309> don't<00:00:46.370> have<00:00:46.610> a

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
uh my hair though and I don't have a

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.520 
uh my hair though and I don't have a
headband<00:00:47.090> it<00:00:47.330> kind<00:00:47.570> of<00:00:47.600> like<00:00:47.780> splits<00:00:48.170> down<00:00:48.379> the

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
headband it kind of like splits down the

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.420 
headband it kind of like splits down the
middle<00:00:48.739> I<00:00:49.010> think<00:00:49.970> that's<00:00:50.360> because<00:00:50.570> the<00:00:51.020> weight

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
middle I think that's because the weight

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.070 
middle I think that's because the weight
might<00:00:52.430> the<00:00:53.030> length<00:00:53.239> of<00:00:53.390> my<00:00:53.480> hair<00:00:53.629> is<00:00:53.750> that<00:00:53.900> now

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:54.080 
might the length of my hair is that now

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.290 
might the length of my hair is that now
but<00:00:54.379> the<00:00:54.559> weight<00:00:54.739> of<00:00:54.770> my<00:00:54.920> hair's<00:00:58.150> looks<00:00:59.150> a

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
but the weight of my hair's looks a

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.610 
but the weight of my hair's looks a
little<00:00:59.420> different<00:00:59.660> than<00:00:59.930> I'm<00:01:00.110> used<00:01:00.140> to<00:01:00.379> used
