00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.960
 It is good 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.409
 I thought 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.659
 From now on 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:57.970
 It has not been decided yet at all 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:59.060

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.190

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:07.560
 One by one I decided firmly 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.560
 I think that I want to do my best 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:21.410
 I have been doing figure skating since I was 5 since I was crazy 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.770
 It's really a small time 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:32.840
 Oh happy that Tteyuu this is to be able to 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:36.290
 I really did it, but as it gets bigger, it gets more and more like pressure 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:41.400
 But I think that becomes larger the Tteyuu that can not Well 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:43.670
 Say Well it can always not forget another cup of the old feelings 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:49.720
 Feeling is over 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.720
 I think it would be good if I could get a plain pair
