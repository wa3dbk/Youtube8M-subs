shot it's not a big deal it just takes

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.380 
shot it's not a big deal it just takes
first<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:02.010> all<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.340> mindset<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:02.969> says

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
first of all that mindset that says

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.270 
first of all that mindset that says
you're<00:01:04.049> gonna<00:01:04.199> play<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> shot<00:01:04.799> here<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.159> can

you're gonna play a shot here you can

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.340 
you're gonna play a shot here you can
accept<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.670> but<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.119> number<00:01:06.420> two<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.840> that

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
accept that but the number two is that

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.170 
accept that but the number two is that
you're<00:01:07.500> gonna<00:01:07.590> take<00:01:07.830> your<00:01:08.010> time<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.430> really

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
you're gonna take your time you really

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.030 
you're gonna take your time you really

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
don't have a put away opportunity from

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.649 
don't have a put away opportunity from
this<00:01:11.189> part<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.610> court<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.420> take

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
this part of the court so you can take

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.080 
this part of the court so you can take
as<00:01:12.900> much<00:01:13.200> time<00:01:13.470> as<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.740> need<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.850> be<00:01:14.880> able

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
as much time as you need to to be able

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.179 
as much time as you need to to be able
to<00:01:15.270> control<00:01:15.990> this<00:01:16.259> shot<00:01:16.500> back<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.100> the

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
to control this shot back to the

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.039 
to control this shot back to the
specific<00:01:17.430> direction<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.360> want<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.720> you

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
specific direction that you want to you

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.289 
specific direction that you want to you
get<00:01:19.259> no<00:01:19.530> value<00:01:20.189> for<00:01:20.220> rushing<00:01:20.909> through<00:01:21.090> this

shot

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.780 

so<00:01:29.440> once<00:01:29.770> you've<00:01:29.890> gone<00:01:30.040> ahead<00:01:30.190> and<00:01:30.400> got<00:01:30.610> your

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
so once you've gone ahead and got your

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.610 
so once you've gone ahead and got your
mind<00:01:31.120> right<00:01:31.479> about<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:32.050> fact<00:01:32.320> you're<00:01:32.530> gonna

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
mind right about the fact you're gonna

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.260 
mind right about the fact you're gonna
play<00:01:32.830> a<00:01:32.860> shot<00:01:33.159> and<00:01:33.430> here<00:01:33.550> the<00:01:33.670> next<00:01:33.909> thing<00:01:34.060> we

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
play a shot and here the next thing we

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.969 
play a shot and here the next thing we
got<00:01:34.420> to<00:01:34.510> work<00:01:34.659> on<00:01:34.840> is<00:01:34.960> your<00:01:34.990> split<00:01:35.440> step<00:01:35.740> and

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
got to work on is your split step and

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.390 
got to work on is your split step and
the<00:01:36.430> timing<00:01:37.119> so<00:01:37.659> that<00:01:38.200> your<00:01:38.500> split<00:01:38.830> step<00:01:39.070> helps

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
the timing so that your split step helps

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.940 
the timing so that your split step helps
you<00:01:39.670> react<00:01:40.150> to<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.510> direction<00:01:41.080> of<00:01:41.229> the<00:01:41.740> shot

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
you react to the direction of the shot

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.770 
you react to the direction of the shot
that<00:01:42.190> your<00:01:42.310> opponent<00:01:42.640> plays<00:01:42.670> back<00:01:43.030> to<00:01:43.300> you<00:01:43.510> and

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
that your opponent plays back to you and

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.749 
that your opponent plays back to you and
you<00:01:44.290> know<00:01:44.380> you've<00:01:44.530> seen<00:01:44.770> on<00:01:44.920> this<00:01:45.040> video<00:01:45.430> where

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
you know you've seen on this video where

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:47.520 
you know you've seen on this video where
I'm<00:01:46.030> starting<00:01:46.690> off<00:01:46.840> the<00:01:46.990> feed<00:01:47.229> and<00:01:47.440> my

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
I'm starting off the feed and my

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.830 
I'm starting off the feed and my
practice<00:01:47.979> partner<00:01:48.400> I'm<00:01:48.580> coming<00:01:49.180> in<00:01:49.300> behind<00:01:49.660> it

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
practice partner I'm coming in behind it

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.810 
practice partner I'm coming in behind it
and<00:01:50.110> you<00:01:50.140> know<00:01:50.710> I'm<00:01:50.860> working<00:01:51.220> on<00:01:51.310> the<00:01:51.400> timing

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
and you know I'm working on the timing

00:01:51.820 --> 00:02:00.630 
and you know I'm working on the timing
of<00:01:51.909> when<00:01:52.119> do<00:01:52.300> I<00:01:52.330> want<00:01:52.570> to<00:01:52.690> split<00:01:59.190> but<00:02:00.190> the<00:02:00.369> key

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
of when do I want to split but the key

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.520 
of when do I want to split but the key
here<00:02:00.670> is<00:02:01.180> that<00:02:01.210> you've<00:02:01.539> always<00:02:01.780> got<00:02:02.080> a<00:02:02.110> split

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
here is that you've always got a split

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.889

whichever you feel is best for that

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.870 
whichever you feel is best for that
particular<00:02:38.470> shot<00:02:38.650> but<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.340> key<00:02:39.549> is<00:02:39.700> that<00:02:39.730> you

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
particular shot but the key is that you

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.130 
particular shot but the key is that you
got<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.209> have<00:02:40.299> a<00:02:40.329> split<00:02:40.660> step<00:02:40.840> and<00:02:41.079> you

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
got to have a split step and you

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.110 
got to have a split step and you
obviously<00:02:41.500> got<00:02:41.650> to<00:02:41.680> work<00:02:41.890> in<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.130> timing<00:02:42.519> the

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
obviously got to work in the timing the

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.240 
obviously got to work in the timing the
timing<00:02:43.150> is<00:02:43.810> different<00:02:43.840> depending<00:02:44.829> on<00:02:44.920> so<00:02:45.130> many

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
timing is different depending on so many

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.250 
timing is different depending on so many
different<00:02:45.489> situations<00:02:46.299> but<00:02:46.390> you<00:02:46.870> know<00:02:46.959> the

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
different situations but you know the

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.080 
different situations but you know the
point<00:02:47.470> now<00:02:47.709> is<00:02:47.920> I<00:02:48.040> want<00:02:48.280> you<00:02:48.430> to<00:02:48.579> get<00:02:48.730> out<00:02:48.760> and
