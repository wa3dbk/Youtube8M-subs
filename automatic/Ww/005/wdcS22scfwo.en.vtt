00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
my team gameplay this coming week doing

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.690 
my team gameplay this coming week doing
all<00:04:34.410> that<00:04:34.530> stuff<00:04:34.860> so<00:04:35.100> I'm<00:04:35.460> pretty<00:04:35.580> excited

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
all that stuff so I'm pretty excited

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.370 
all that stuff so I'm pretty excited
about<00:04:36.030> that<00:04:36.180> Reggie<00:04:36.600> Williams<00:04:36.870> is<00:04:37.140> a<00:04:37.170> good

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
about that Reggie Williams is a good

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.170 
about that Reggie Williams is a good
player<00:04:37.620> for<00:04:37.710> the<00:04:37.890> Cavaliers<00:04:38.370> too<00:04:38.610> so<00:04:38.850> it<00:04:38.970> seems

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
player for the Cavaliers too so it seems

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.670 
player for the Cavaliers too so it seems
like<00:04:39.330> this<00:04:39.480> purple<00:04:39.750> gold<00:04:40.050> gold<00:04:40.320> thing<00:04:40.560> is

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
like this purple gold gold thing is

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.970 
like this purple gold gold thing is
enough<00:04:40.950> to<00:04:41.070> mix<00:04:41.280> it<00:04:41.430> up<00:04:41.580> and<00:04:41.850> I<00:04:42.920> kind<00:04:43.920> of

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
enough to mix it up and I kind of

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.500 
enough to mix it up and I kind of
believe<00:04:44.280> that<00:04:44.310> you<00:04:44.730> know<00:04:44.760> with<00:04:44.970> the<00:04:45.090> exception

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
believe that you know with the exception

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:46.940 
believe that you know with the exception
of<00:04:45.570> gold<00:04:45.780> packs<00:04:46.020> having<00:04:46.350> that<00:04:46.470> higher<00:04:46.650> chance

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
of gold packs having that higher chance

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.680 
of gold packs having that higher chance
of<00:04:47.040> getting<00:04:47.250> to<00:04:47.310> go<00:04:47.400> a<00:04:47.430> player<00:04:47.730> I<00:04:47.940> do<00:04:48.240> think

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
of getting to go a player I do think

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.930 
of getting to go a player I do think
that<00:04:48.810> when<00:04:49.170> you<00:04:49.200> start<00:04:49.650> hitting<00:04:50.220> five<00:04:50.490> six

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
that when you start hitting five six

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.510 
that when you start hitting five six
seven<00:04:51.240> packs<00:04:51.630> in<00:04:51.870> a<00:04:51.930> row<00:04:52.140> at<00:04:52.830> a<00:04:52.890> certain<00:04:53.250> point

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
seven packs in a row at a certain point

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.070 
seven packs in a row at a certain point
you<00:04:53.760> need<00:04:53.940> to<00:04:54.000> mix<00:04:54.210> it<00:04:54.420> up<00:04:54.510> and<00:04:54.720> maybe<00:04:54.810> buy<00:04:55.050> a

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
you need to mix it up and maybe buy a

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.260 
you need to mix it up and maybe buy a
goat<00:04:55.410> or<00:04:55.560> a<00:04:55.680> purple<00:04:56.190> pack<00:04:56.400> and<00:04:56.670> then<00:04:57.090> go<00:04:57.240> back

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
goat or a purple pack and then go back

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.900 
goat or a purple pack and then go back
so<00:04:57.750> I<00:04:57.780> think<00:04:57.960> that's<00:04:58.200> why<00:04:58.470> this<00:04:58.530> method<00:04:59.100> works

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
so I think that's why this method works

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.330 
so I think that's why this method works
pretty<00:05:00.150> well<00:05:00.300> purple<00:05:01.200> bell<00:05:01.350> gold<00:05:01.620> not<00:05:02.100> a<00:05:02.130> bad

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
pretty well purple bell gold not a bad

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.280 
pretty well purple bell gold not a bad
idea<00:05:02.370> works<00:05:03.150> for<00:05:03.330> shake<00:05:03.510> and<00:05:03.690> bake<00:05:03.780> seems<00:05:04.170> to

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
idea works for shake and bake seems to

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.290 
idea works for shake and bake seems to
work<00:05:04.440> for<00:05:04.620> me<00:05:04.800> and<00:05:05.010> we<00:05:05.820> really<00:05:06.030> enjoyed<00:05:06.060> doing

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
work for me and we really enjoyed doing

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.700

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
little bit for that and seeing a lot of

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.950 
little bit for that and seeing a lot of
other<00:05:19.530> commentators<00:05:20.040> pick<00:05:20.370> up<00:05:20.550> my<00:05:20.760> team<00:05:21.030> you

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
other commentators pick up my team you

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.570 
other commentators pick up my team you
know<00:05:22.050> not<00:05:22.260> because<00:05:22.530> of<00:05:22.560> us<00:05:22.830> but<00:05:23.040> it<00:05:23.190> is<00:05:23.340> an

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
know not because of us but it is an

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.640 
know not because of us but it is an
enjoyable<00:05:24.210> mode<00:05:24.420> I<00:05:24.660> kind<00:05:25.110> of<00:05:25.170> figured<00:05:25.320> what

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
enjoyable mode I kind of figured what

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.170 
enjoyable mode I kind of figured what
would<00:05:25.770> happen<00:05:26.190> when<00:05:26.310> I<00:05:26.370> found<00:05:26.610> out<00:05:26.760> about<00:05:26.820> my

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
would happen when I found out about my

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.420 
would happen when I found out about my
team<00:05:27.420> coming<00:05:27.660> out<00:05:27.900> I<00:05:28.170> figured<00:05:28.890> that<00:05:29.010> my<00:05:29.160> team

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
team coming out I figured that my team

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.490 
team coming out I figured that my team
would<00:05:29.580> be<00:05:29.700> a<00:05:29.730> deal<00:05:30.000> where<00:05:30.300> people<00:05:31.260> would<00:05:31.320> think

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
would be a deal where people would think

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.990 
would be a deal where people would think
oh<00:05:31.680> that's<00:05:31.920> cool<00:05:32.160> and<00:05:32.460> some<00:05:32.700> people<00:05:32.940> would

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
oh that's cool and some people would

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.490 
oh that's cool and some people would
pick<00:05:33.150> it<00:05:33.270> up<00:05:33.390> right<00:05:33.540> away<00:05:33.660> like<00:05:33.960> I<00:05:34.110> did<00:05:34.140> because
