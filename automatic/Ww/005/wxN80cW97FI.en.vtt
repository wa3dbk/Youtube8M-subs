height<00:01:02.960> what<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:03.989> like<00:01:04.260> about<00:01:04.290> this<00:01:04.559> tripod<00:01:05.369> is

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
height what I like about this tripod is

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.880 
height what I like about this tripod is

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
that the camera mount this is full

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.330 
that the camera mount this is full
plastic<00:01:08.510> so<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.570> could<00:01:09.750> break<00:01:09.930> easily<00:01:10.350> if<00:01:10.860> it's

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
plastic so it could break easily if it's

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.109 
plastic so it could break easily if it's
drop<00:01:11.790> or<00:01:12.180> if<00:01:12.659> you're<00:01:13.590> using<00:01:13.770> heavy<00:01:14.100> cameras
