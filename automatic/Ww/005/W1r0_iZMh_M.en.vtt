00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
I've made first I just had to find the

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.009 
I've made first I just had to find the
pepakura<00:00:23.939> file<00:00:24.210> which<00:00:24.359> wasn't<00:00:24.539> too<00:00:24.750> hard<00:00:24.960> that

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
pepakura file which wasn't too hard that

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.679 
pepakura file which wasn't too hard that
found<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.470> halo<00:00:25.650> reach<00:00:25.949> thread<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:26.699> just<00:00:27.480> googled

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.339 
found a halo reach thread I just googled
Halo<00:00:28.140> Reach<00:00:28.849> noble<00:00:29.849> six<00:00:30.029> helmet<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.900> went

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
Halo Reach noble six helmet and I went

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.080

they<00:00:31.769> had<00:00:31.800> one<00:00:32.070> on<00:00:32.099> for<00:00:32.460> o<00:00:32.489> v<00:00:32.730> calm<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.620> then

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
they had one on for o v calm and then

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.310 
they had one on for o v calm and then
anyway<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.120> made<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.780> scale<00:00:36.989> was<00:00:37.140> just

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
anyway I made that the scale was just

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.950 
anyway I made that the scale was just
about<00:00:37.469> perfect<00:00:37.760> but<00:00:38.760> actually<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.570> scale<00:00:39.809> was

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
about perfect but actually the scale was

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.209 
about perfect but actually the scale was
alright<00:00:40.230> when<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.379> first<00:00:40.620> got<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.920> but<00:00:41.100> then

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
alright when I first got it but then

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.530 
alright when I first got it but then
that<00:00:41.340> intrusted<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.000> made<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.360> few

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
that intrusted so I made it a few

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.529 
that intrusted so I made it a few
centimeters<00:00:43.079> wider<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.579> made<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.360> rest

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
centimeters wider and that made the rest

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.060 
centimeters wider and that made the rest
of<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.690> helmet<00:00:45.930> larger<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.559> then<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.890> turned

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
of the helmet larger and then it turned

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.520 
of the helmet larger and then it turned
out<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.309> be<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.430> little<00:00:47.640> bit<00:00:47.789> too<00:00:48.030> large<00:00:48.530> but

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
out to be a little bit too large but

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.630 
out to be a little bit too large but
it's<00:00:49.980> not<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.550> much<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:51.210> problem<00:00:52.640> and

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
it's not that much of a problem and

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.439 
it's not that much of a problem and
after<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.180> then<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:55.289> think<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.190> used<00:00:56.430> not<00:00:57.239> too

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
after that then I I think I used not too

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.180 
after that then I I think I used not too
much<00:00:57.629> about<00:00:57.960> three-quarters<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.649> can<00:00:58.890> of

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
much about three-quarters of a can of

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.450 
much about three-quarters of a can of
fiberglass<00:01:00.050> resin<00:01:01.050> sorry<00:01:01.770> for<00:01:01.920> shaky<00:01:02.160> camera

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
fiberglass resin sorry for shaky camera

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.219 
fiberglass resin sorry for shaky camera
um<00:01:02.910> bad<00:01:03.629> tripod<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:05.360> you<00:01:06.360> know<00:01:06.450> solidify<00:01:06.780> this

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.440 
um bad tripod to you know solidify this
and<00:01:07.409> then<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.280> just<00:01:08.340> did<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:08.820> quickly<00:01:09.210> on<00:01:09.360> the

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
and then I just did that quickly on the

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.170 
and then I just did that quickly on the
outside<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.170> then<00:01:10.500> on<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.740> inside<00:01:11.000> you<00:01:12.000> can't

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
outside and then on the inside you can't

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.530 
outside and then on the inside you can't
see<00:01:12.299> right<00:01:12.450> now<00:01:12.600> but<00:01:12.950> I<00:01:13.950> used<00:01:14.610> these<00:01:14.939> strips<00:01:15.330> of

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
see right now but I used these strips of

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.010 
see right now but I used these strips of
like<00:01:16.400> it's<00:01:17.400> called<00:01:17.640> fiberglass<00:01:18.150> mat<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.780> then

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
like it's called fiberglass mat and then

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.830 
like it's called fiberglass mat and then
you<00:01:19.259> just<00:01:19.530> brush<00:01:20.280> on<00:01:20.520> fiberglass<00:01:21.180> resin<00:01:21.689> onto

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
you just brush on fiberglass resin onto

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.200 
you just brush on fiberglass resin onto
that<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.320> coat<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.130> inside<00:01:23.549> with<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:23.939> makes

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
that and coat the inside with it makes

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.179 
that and coat the inside with it makes
it<00:01:24.570> makes<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.080> paper<00:01:25.290> hard<00:01:25.590> as<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.740> rock<00:01:25.830> you

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
it makes the paper hard as a rock you

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.969 
it makes the paper hard as a rock you
really<00:01:26.490> can't<00:01:26.759> break<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.750> anymore<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.920> after

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
really can't break it anymore and after

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.810 
really can't break it anymore and after
that<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:30.329> used<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.439> spray<00:01:31.890> painted<00:01:32.310> coat<00:01:32.579> of

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
that I I used a spray painted coat of

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.050 
that I I used a spray painted coat of
black<00:01:33.210> primer<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:34.229> actually<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:35.549> fill<00:01:35.759> in<00:01:35.939> all

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
black primer to actually to fill in all

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.749 
black primer to actually to fill in all
the<00:01:36.180> details<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:37.049> give<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.759> textured

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
the details and to give it a textured

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.889 
the details and to give it a textured
base<00:01:39.439> camera<00:01:40.439> won't<00:01:40.560> focus<00:01:40.740> but<00:01:41.610> it's<00:01:42.509> much

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
base camera won't focus but it's much

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.600 
base camera won't focus but it's much
better<00:01:43.110> than<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.799> camera<00:01:44.159> doesn't<00:01:44.430> do

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
better than the camera doesn't do

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.800 
better than the camera doesn't do
justice<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.240> but<00:01:46.170> anyway<00:01:47.479> after<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.630> then

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
justice to it but anyway after that then

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.260 
justice to it but anyway after that then
I<00:01:48.840> just<00:01:48.930> took<00:01:49.259> brown<00:01:49.799> water-based<00:01:50.670> paint<00:01:51.030> and

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
I just took brown water-based paint and

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.440 
I just took brown water-based paint and
painted<00:01:51.689> in<00:01:51.810> around<00:01:52.790> other<00:01:53.790> parts<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.240> brown

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
painted in around other parts of a brown

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.600 
painted in around other parts of a brown
but<00:01:54.899> then<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.740> only<00:01:55.860> tough<00:01:56.070> part<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.399> really

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
but then the only tough part I really

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.969 
but then the only tough part I really
had<00:01:56.790> was<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.119> visor<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:58.320> can<00:01:58.469> still<00:01:58.680> see<00:01:58.860> the

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
had was the visor you can still see the

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.969 
had was the visor you can still see the
lines<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.780> hot<00:02:00.780> glue<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:00.990> had<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.409> use<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:01.710> part

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
lines of hot glue I had to use this part

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.690 
lines of hot glue I had to use this part
I<00:02:02.159> botched<00:02:02.520> up<00:02:02.790> quite<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.119> bit<00:02:03.799> I<00:02:04.799> bought<00:02:05.520> like<00:02:05.640> a

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
I botched up quite a bit I bought like a

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.700 
I botched up quite a bit I bought like a
motorcycle<00:02:06.119> visor<00:02:06.719> at<00:02:07.049> farm<00:02:07.290> inflate<00:02:07.590> those

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
motorcycle visor at farm inflate those

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.080 
motorcycle visor at farm inflate those
really<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.069> only<00:02:08.250> thing<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.610> could<00:02:08.789> think<00:02:08.819> of

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
really the only thing I could think of

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.229 
really the only thing I could think of
to<00:02:09.149> use<00:02:09.920> for<00:02:10.920> this<00:02:11.039> one<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.459> then<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:11.940> took<00:02:12.060> a

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
to use for this one and then I took a

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.679 
to use for this one and then I took a
had<00:02:14.079> used<00:02:14.290> scissors<00:02:14.739> before<00:02:15.250> to<00:02:15.400> cut<00:02:15.610> out<00:02:15.849> the

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:16.689 
had used scissors before to cut out the

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:19.530 
had used scissors before to cut out the
paper<00:02:17.019> or<00:02:17.439> cardstock<00:02:18.159> version<00:02:18.909> of<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.299> visor

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
paper or cardstock version of the visor

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.660 
paper or cardstock version of the visor
and<00:02:19.930> then<00:02:20.530> I<00:02:20.560> traced<00:02:21.010> that<00:02:21.189> over<00:02:21.549> the

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
and then I traced that over the

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.490 
and then I traced that over the
motorcycle<00:02:22.269> visor<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.599> used<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.930> Dremel<00:02:23.319> on

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
motorcycle visor and used the Dremel on

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.850 
motorcycle visor and used the Dremel on
a<00:02:23.909> real<00:02:24.909> high<00:02:25.090> speed<00:02:25.480> and<00:02:25.689> cloth<00:02:26.439> padding

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
a real high speed and cloth padding

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.080 
a real high speed and cloth padding
underneath<00:02:27.099> so<00:02:27.340> I<00:02:27.400> wouldn't<00:02:27.610> scratch<00:02:27.819> it<00:02:28.000> up

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
underneath so I wouldn't scratch it up

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.720 
underneath so I wouldn't scratch it up
to<00:02:28.269> cut<00:02:28.480> around<00:02:28.989> the<00:02:29.140> lines<00:02:29.349> it<00:02:30.220> still<00:02:30.519> turned

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
to cut around the lines it still turned

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.610 
to cut around the lines it still turned
out<00:02:30.849> a<00:02:30.879> little<00:02:31.030> bit<00:02:31.239> messed<00:02:31.510> up<00:02:31.750> but<00:02:31.989> I<00:02:32.260> was

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
out a little bit messed up but I was

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.349 
out a little bit messed up but I was
able<00:02:32.829> to<00:02:32.950> get<00:02:33.159> in<00:02:33.310> but<00:02:33.489> the<00:02:33.609> bad<00:02:33.790> thing<00:02:33.819> was<00:02:34.180> it

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:34.359 
able to get in but the bad thing was it

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:36.330 
able to get in but the bad thing was it
wasn't<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.840> same<00:02:35.079> curve<00:02:35.500> as<00:02:35.739> the<00:02:35.769> helmet<00:02:36.189> is<00:02:36.310> a

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
wasn't the same curve as the helmet is a

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.880 
wasn't the same curve as the helmet is a
little<00:02:36.519> bit<00:02:36.609> wider<00:02:36.849> so<00:02:37.180> I<00:02:37.750> had<00:02:37.959> to<00:02:38.109> first<00:02:38.769> I

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
little bit wider so I had to first I

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.710 
little bit wider so I had to first I
tried<00:02:39.189> using<00:02:39.609> heat<00:02:39.909> gun<00:02:40.120> which<00:02:40.329> has<00:02:40.510> used

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
tried using heat gun which has used

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.140 
tried using heat gun which has used
worked<00:02:41.140> for<00:02:41.319> me<00:02:41.439> before<00:02:41.590> melting<00:02:41.980> PVC<00:02:42.970> and

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
worked for me before melting PVC and

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.180 
worked for me before melting PVC and
bending<00:02:43.450> that<00:02:43.629> but<00:02:44.409> this<00:02:44.560> just<00:02:44.769> made<00:02:44.920> a<00:02:44.950> little

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
bending that but this just made a little

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.449 
bending that but this just made a little
bit<00:02:45.280> foggy<00:02:45.519> so<00:02:45.819> I<00:02:45.879> stopped<00:02:46.239> before<00:02:46.540> it<00:02:46.780> would

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
bit foggy so I stopped before it would

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.330 
bit foggy so I stopped before it would
take<00:02:48.459> away<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:49.120> clearness<00:02:49.420> and<00:02:50.040> then<00:02:51.040> I<00:02:51.069> just

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
take away the clearness and then I just

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.220 
take away the clearness and then I just
basically<00:02:51.670> had<00:02:51.940> to<00:02:52.120> wedge<00:02:52.450> it<00:02:52.629> into<00:02:52.750> place<00:02:52.989> as

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
basically had to wedge it into place as

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
basically had to wedge it into place as
I<00:02:54.450> hot-glued<00:02:55.450> it<00:02:55.780> in<00:02:55.930> but<00:02:56.620> other<00:02:56.739> than<00:02:56.889> that<00:02:57.069> at

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
I hot-glued it in but other than that at

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.890 
I hot-glued it in but other than that at
that<00:02:57.400> part<00:02:57.639> turned<00:02:58.030> out<00:02:58.180> okay

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
that part turned out okay

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.349 
that part turned out okay
I<00:02:58.930> painted<00:02:59.379> in<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.739> I<00:03:00.159> never<00:03:01.060> know<00:03:01.180> what<00:03:01.269> you

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
I painted in the I never know what you

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:04.910 
I painted in the I never know what you
call<00:03:01.540> just<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:01.959> visor<00:03:02.439> lines<00:03:02.799> and<00:03:03.129> then<00:03:03.849> I<00:03:03.879> use

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
call just the visor lines and then I use

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.819 
call just the visor lines and then I use
foam<00:03:05.920> pipe<00:03:06.370> insulators<00:03:07.120> to<00:03:07.870> make<00:03:08.049> the<00:03:08.200> base<00:03:08.470> of

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
foam pipe insulators to make the base of

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:10.890 
foam pipe insulators to make the base of
this<00:03:09.099> I<00:03:09.430> know<00:03:10.060> it<00:03:10.150> got<00:03:10.269> kind<00:03:10.480> of<00:03:10.510> messed<00:03:10.720> up

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
this I know it got kind of messed up

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.440 
this I know it got kind of messed up
around<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.290> edges<00:03:11.920> sometimes<00:03:12.730> if<00:03:13.180> used<00:03:13.329> too

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
around the edges sometimes if used too

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.149 
around the edges sometimes if used too
much<00:03:13.569> rezident<00:03:14.139> kind<00:03:14.349> of<00:03:14.439> warps<00:03:14.799> the<00:03:14.859> paper

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:15.159 
much rezident kind of warps the paper

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:19.229 
much rezident kind of warps the paper
and<00:03:15.430> then<00:03:17.489> can't<00:03:18.489> remember<00:03:18.669> what<00:03:18.849> the<00:03:18.970> soft

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
and then can't remember what the soft

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.000 
and then can't remember what the soft
foam<00:03:19.569> around<00:03:19.780> here<00:03:20.290> was<00:03:20.470> called<00:03:20.739> around<00:03:20.919> the

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
foam around here was called around the

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.629 
foam around here was called around the
ears<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:21.579> stuff<00:03:21.879> but<00:03:22.870> it<00:03:23.410> was<00:03:23.500> used<00:03:24.190> for<00:03:24.340> like

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
ears and stuff but it was used for like

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.610 
ears and stuff but it was used for like
holding<00:03:25.090> in<00:03:25.209> like<00:03:25.449> air<00:03:25.690> conditioning<00:03:26.319> units

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
holding in like air conditioning units

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.960 
holding in like air conditioning units
actually<00:03:26.980> I<00:03:27.010> found<00:03:27.190> it<00:03:27.340> for<00:03:27.489> just<00:03:27.669> a<00:03:27.760> few<00:03:27.910> bucks

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
actually I found it for just a few bucks

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.460 
actually I found it for just a few bucks
and<00:03:28.480> then<00:03:28.599> you<00:03:28.659> can<00:03:28.780> cut<00:03:28.959> it<00:03:29.079> up<00:03:29.199> really<00:03:29.349> easily

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
and then you can cut it up really easily

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.670 
and then you can cut it up really easily
and<00:03:29.889> it's<00:03:30.040> nice<00:03:30.310> soft<00:03:30.579> foam<00:03:30.989> but<00:03:31.989> anyway<00:03:32.470> that

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
and it's nice soft foam but anyway that

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.260 
and it's nice soft foam but anyway that
is<00:03:32.709> my<00:03:33.129> noble<00:03:33.669> six<00:03:33.970> helmet<00:03:34.359> remember<00:03:35.079> each
