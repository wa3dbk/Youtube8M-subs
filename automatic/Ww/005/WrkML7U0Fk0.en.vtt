00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
I guess today I'm going to be showing

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.670 
I guess today I'm going to be showing
you<00:00:02.700> something<00:00:02.939> I<00:00:03.090> made<00:00:03.270> for<00:00:03.319> Minecraft<00:00:04.319> and

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
you something I made for Minecraft and

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.650 
you something I made for Minecraft and
this<00:00:05.520> is<00:00:05.609> actually<00:00:05.910> something<00:00:06.089> I'm<00:00:06.330> gonna<00:00:06.509> be

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
this is actually something I'm gonna be

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.950 
this is actually something I'm gonna be
using<00:00:06.810> because<00:00:07.460> soon<00:00:08.460> I<00:00:08.760> am<00:00:09.179> moving<00:00:09.480> my<00:00:09.599> server

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
using because soon I am moving my server

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.140 
using because soon I am moving my server
from<00:00:10.349> beast<00:00:11.219> kme<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:12.240> somewhere<00:00:12.630> else<00:00:13.400> so<00:00:14.400> in

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
from beast kme to somewhere else so in

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.590 
from beast kme to somewhere else so in
that<00:00:15.809> case<00:00:16.049> what<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:16.680> would<00:00:16.859> do<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.640> make<00:00:18.480> sure

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
that case what you would do to make sure

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.529 
that case what you would do to make sure
everyone<00:00:18.960> knows<00:00:18.990> where<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.560> new<00:00:19.740> place<00:00:20.010> is

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:20.539 
everyone knows where that new place is

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.230 
everyone knows where that new place is
is<00:00:21.539> you<00:00:22.020> could<00:00:22.289> host<00:00:22.859> an<00:00:23.160> old<00:00:23.400> server<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:24.090> then

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
is you could host an old server and then

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.609 
is you could host an old server and then
lock<00:00:24.510> it<00:00:24.660> down<00:00:24.779> with<00:00:24.990> permissions<00:00:25.470> or

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
lock it down with permissions or

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.050 
lock it down with permissions or
something<00:00:27.019> but<00:00:28.019> that's<00:00:28.260> really<00:00:28.789> not<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.849> good

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
something but that's really not a good

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.749 
something but that's really not a good
way<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.480> go<00:00:30.720> about<00:00:30.750> it<00:00:31.109> because<00:00:31.759> you're

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
way to go about it because you're

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.400 
way to go about it because you're
running<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.120> huge<00:00:33.360> minecraft<00:00:33.899> server<00:00:34.140> it's

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
running a huge minecraft server it's

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.229 
running a huge minecraft server it's
taking<00:00:34.739> gigabytes<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.370> memory<00:00:35.430> well<00:00:35.880> maybe

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
taking gigabytes of memory well maybe

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.619 
taking gigabytes of memory well maybe
not<00:00:36.390> gigabytes<00:00:36.690> if<00:00:36.930> no<00:00:37.020> one's<00:00:37.170> using<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.530> but<00:00:37.739> a

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
not gigabytes if no one's using it but a

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.750 
not gigabytes if no one's using it but a
certainly<00:00:39.629> not<00:00:39.980> the<00:00:40.980> most<00:00:41.129> efficient<00:00:41.610> way<00:00:41.670> to

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
certainly not the most efficient way to

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.470 
certainly not the most efficient way to
go<00:00:41.969> about<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.680> so<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:44.430> have<00:00:44.640> made<00:00:44.879> my<00:00:45.300> own<00:00:45.329> little

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
go about it so I have made my own little

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.680 
go about it so I have made my own little
program<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:47.239> will<00:00:48.239> interface<00:00:48.629> with

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
program that will interface with

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.959 
program that will interface with
minecraft<00:00:49.350> it'll<00:00:49.710> be<00:00:50.160> like<00:00:50.309> kind<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.700> fake

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
minecraft it'll be like kind of a fake

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.170 
minecraft it'll be like kind of a fake
server<00:00:52.219> so<00:00:54.590> here<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:56.010> run<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.399> this<00:00:57.000> is

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
server so here it is you run it this is

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.950 
server so here it is you run it this is
a<00:00:57.420> Python<00:00:57.989> program<00:00:58.699> dot<00:00:59.699> py<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.660> will<00:01:00.780> run<00:01:00.930> on

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
a Python program dot py it will run on

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.250 
a Python program dot py it will run on
pythons<00:01:01.890> version<00:01:02.250> two<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.730> three<00:01:03.090> on<00:01:03.329> Linux

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
pythons version two and three on Linux

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.109 
pythons version two and three on Linux
and<00:01:04.439> two<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.830> three<00:01:04.860> on<00:01:05.100> Windows<00:01:05.519> I've<00:01:05.760> tested

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
and two and three on Windows I've tested

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.789 
and two and three on Windows I've tested
them<00:01:06.270> both<00:01:08.540> so<00:01:09.540> when<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.290> refresh<00:01:10.500> it

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
them both so when you refresh it

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.359 
them both so when you refresh it
it<00:01:10.979> has<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.369> configurable<00:01:12.180> message<00:01:12.750> right<00:01:12.900> here

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
it has a configurable message right here

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.649 
it has a configurable message right here
it's<00:01:14.369> got<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.700> current<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.150> total<00:01:15.420> number<00:01:15.630> of

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
it's got the current and total number of

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.200 
it's got the current and total number of
players<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.080> can<00:01:16.430> change<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.670> as<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.939> want

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
players you can change that as you want

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.390 
players you can change that as you want
actually<00:01:18.689> when<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.710> try<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.890> join<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.310> it

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
actually when you try to join it it

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.999 
actually when you try to join it it
sends<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.880> different<00:01:21.630> message<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.860> can

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
sends you a different message you can

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.670 
sends you a different message you can
say<00:01:23.580> down<00:01:23.820> for<00:01:24.000> maintenance<00:01:24.320> you<00:01:25.320> can<00:01:25.409> say

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
say down for maintenance you can say

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.789 
say down for maintenance you can say
it's<00:01:25.799> moved<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.130> somewhere<00:01:26.430> else<00:01:27.799> and

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
it's moved to somewhere else and

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.390 
it's moved to somewhere else and
actually<00:01:29.070> on<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.689> second<00:01:31.049> one<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.380> have<00:01:32.009> the

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
actually on the second one I have the

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.950 
actually on the second one I have the
total<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.030> current<00:01:33.270> number<00:01:33.479> place<00:01:33.659> set<00:01:33.869> to

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
total and current number place set to

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.300 
total and current number place set to
zero<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.290> if<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.470> do<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.950> just<00:01:35.100> has

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
zero and if you do that it just has

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.880 
zero and if you do that it just has
question<00:01:35.759> marks<00:01:35.990> so<00:01:36.990> maybe<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.560> want<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.770> do

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
question marks so maybe you want to do

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.179 
question marks so maybe you want to do
that<00:01:38.750> when<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.869> refresh<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.439> list<00:01:40.560> when

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
that when you refresh the list when

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.580 
that when you refresh the list when
anyone<00:01:41.930> refreshes<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.020> end<00:01:43.170> it's<00:01:43.290> on<00:01:43.409> it's

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
anyone refreshes the end it's on it's

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.859 
anyone refreshes the end it's on it's
there<00:01:43.860> bookmark<00:01:44.280> list<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:45.240> see<00:01:45.509> their<00:01:45.689> IP

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
there bookmark list you see their IP

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.800 
there bookmark list you see their IP
address<00:01:46.290> in<00:01:46.890> this<00:01:47.549> case<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:47.909> just<00:01:48.210> my<00:01:48.329> Epirus

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
address in this case is just my Epirus

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.260 
address in this case is just my Epirus
on<00:01:49.079> my<00:01:49.290> home<00:01:49.560> network<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.130> when<00:01:50.939> they<00:01:51.030> try<00:01:51.210> to

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
on my home network and when they try to

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.090 
on my home network and when they try to
join<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.810> get<00:01:52.079> their<00:01:52.259> IP<00:01:52.439> address<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:52.829> you

join it you get their IP address and you

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.560 
join it you get their IP address and you
also<00:01:53.310> get<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.790> name<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.240> they<00:01:54.329> tried<00:01:54.540> to

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
also get the name that they tried to

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:02.090 
also get the name that they tried to
login<00:01:54.840> with<00:01:57.380> here's<00:01:58.380> we<00:01:58.590> set<00:01:59.040> the

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.570 

all<00:02:03.060> those<00:02:03.390> variables<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.500> set<00:02:04.799> this<00:02:05.369> is<00:02:05.549> the

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
all those variables you set this is the

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.580 
all those variables you set this is the
message<00:02:05.939> of<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.210> day<00:02:08.750> so<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:09.990> would<00:02:10.110> be<00:02:10.289> the

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
message of the day so that would be the

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.070 
message of the day so that would be the
message<00:02:10.739> that<00:02:11.069> shows<00:02:11.280> up<00:02:11.430> right<00:02:11.550> here<00:02:11.610> and

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
message that shows up right here and

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.290 
message that shows up right here and
then<00:02:13.130> here's<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.190> drawing<00:02:14.610> message<00:02:15.060> when<00:02:15.270> it

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
then here's the drawing message when it

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.900 
then here's the drawing message when it
disconnects<00:02:15.840> you

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
disconnects you

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.610 
disconnects you
that's<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.480> message<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:18.870> pops<00:02:19.050> up<00:02:19.230> there<00:02:19.410> and

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
that's the message it pops up there and

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.400 
that's the message it pops up there and
then<00:02:19.709> current<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.580> total<00:02:20.790> number<00:02:20.880> of<00:02:21.060> players

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
then current and total number of players

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.640 
then current and total number of players
and<00:02:22.430> this<00:02:23.430> is<00:02:23.610> your<00:02:23.910> network<00:02:24.540> on<00:02:24.810> your<00:02:25.020> home

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
and this is your network on your home

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.620 
and this is your network on your home
network<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.160> here's<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.060> port<00:02:27.300> and<00:02:27.450> they<00:02:27.510> all

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
network and here's the port and they all

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:28.940 
network and here's the port and they all
have<00:02:27.750> to<00:02:27.870> be<00:02:27.900> in<00:02:28.050> quotes<00:02:28.230> except<00:02:28.560> for<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.709> port

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
have to be in quotes except for the port

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.090 
have to be in quotes except for the port
by<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.220> way<00:02:32.600> I'm<00:02:33.600> probably<00:02:34.020> going<00:02:34.350> to<00:02:34.410> be

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
by the way I'm probably going to be

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.740 
by the way I'm probably going to be
putting<00:02:35.340> this<00:02:35.489> up<00:02:35.670> on<00:02:35.760> pastebin<00:02:36.300> I'm

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
putting this up on pastebin I'm

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.550 
putting this up on pastebin I'm
definitely<00:02:37.260> going<00:02:37.350> to<00:02:37.410> be<00:02:37.470> sharing<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:37.950> code

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.710 

it's<00:02:43.560> also<00:02:44.180> multi-threaded<00:02:45.180> meaning<00:02:45.480> it<00:02:45.569> can

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
it's also multi-threaded meaning it can

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.750 
it's also multi-threaded meaning it can
handle<00:02:45.870> more<00:02:46.200> than<00:02:46.500> one<00:02:46.680> connection<00:02:47.160> at<00:02:47.519> one

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
handle more than one connection at one

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.030 
handle more than one connection at one
time<00:02:48.080> so<00:02:49.080> if<00:02:49.290> there's<00:02:49.470> a<00:02:49.530> really<00:02:49.739> slow

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
time so if there's a really slow

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.290 
time so if there's a really slow
connection<00:02:50.519> or<00:02:50.670> like<00:02:50.850> a<00:02:50.880> half-open

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
connection or like a half-open

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.390 
connection or like a half-open
connection<00:02:52.220> it<00:02:53.220> will<00:02:53.400> actually<00:02:55.100> be<00:02:56.100> able<00:02:56.250> to

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
connection it will actually be able to

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.650 
connection it will actually be able to
accept<00:02:56.819> connections<00:02:56.940> even<00:02:58.130> when<00:02:59.130> it's<00:02:59.310> a

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
accept connections even when it's a

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.440 
accept connections even when it's a
stuck<00:03:00.660> on<00:03:00.810> an<00:03:00.959> old<00:03:01.080> connection<00:03:01.560> or<00:03:01.650> something

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
stuck on an old connection or something

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.600 
stuck on an old connection or something
so<00:03:03.450> yeah<00:03:06.739> I'll<00:03:07.739> be<00:03:07.829> sharing<00:03:08.040> this<00:03:08.310> you<00:03:08.459> can

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610

so yeah I'll be sharing this you can
pick<00:03:08.730> it<00:03:08.850> up<00:03:08.970> if<00:03:09.090> you<00:03:09.239> have<00:03:09.510> one<00:03:09.720> of<00:03:09.750> these<00:03:10.040> if

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
pick it up if you have one of these if

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.800 
pick it up if you have one of these if
you're<00:03:11.519> moving<00:03:11.670> a<00:03:11.910> server<00:03:12.120> or<00:03:12.299> you<00:03:12.480> just<00:03:12.660> need

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
you're moving a server or you just need

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.100 
you're moving a server or you just need
to<00:03:12.900> do<00:03:12.989> maintenance<00:03:13.230> on<00:03:13.500> a<00:03:13.530> server<00:03:14.900> this<00:03:15.900> would

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
to do maintenance on a server this would

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.680 
to do maintenance on a server this would
be<00:03:16.170> a<00:03:16.200> good<00:03:16.350> tool<00:03:16.560> to<00:03:16.590> have
