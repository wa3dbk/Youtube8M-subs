00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
over I got to do this with glance are

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.920 
over I got to do this with glance are
the<00:01:10.740> video<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.369> can't<00:01:11.610> see<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.090> the

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
the video and you can't see it the

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.340 
the video and you can't see it the
navigation<00:01:13.650> would<00:01:13.830> be<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.760> prison<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.990> I

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
navigation would be in the prison so I

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.980 
navigation would be in the prison so I
would<00:01:16.950> have<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.310> just<00:01:17.369> glance<00:01:17.939> upward<00:01:18.420> like

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
would have to just glance upward like

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.850 
would have to just glance upward like
this<00:01:19.259> I'm<00:01:20.250> glancing<00:01:20.700> upward<00:01:21.060> now<00:01:21.560> if<00:01:22.560> you

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
this I'm glancing upward now if you

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.030 
this I'm glancing upward now if you
noticed<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:24.200> street<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.350> everything<00:01:25.890> is

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
noticed the street and everything is

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.910 
noticed the street and everything is
still<00:01:26.280> visible<00:01:27.320> so<00:01:28.320> I've<00:01:28.409> looked<00:01:28.619> at<00:01:28.770> my

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
still visible so I've looked at my

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.670 
still visible so I've looked at my
navigation<00:01:29.820> for<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.090> second<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.630> glance<00:01:31.290> up<00:01:31.530> look

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
navigation for a second a glance up look

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.179 
navigation for a second a glance up look
at<00:01:31.770> my<00:01:31.829> navigation<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.610> like<00:01:32.820> back<00:01:33.000> down<00:01:34.189> versus

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
at my navigation I like back down versus

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.960 
at my navigation I like back down versus
looking<00:01:35.340> at<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.700> GPS<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.360> car<00:01:36.650> boom

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.780 

so<00:01:40.970> I<00:01:41.270> think<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:41.690> arguments<00:01:42.290> about<00:01:42.440> the

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
so I think the arguments about the

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.780 
so I think the arguments about the
distraction<00:01:43.790> of<00:01:44.060> glass<00:01:44.600> while<00:01:45.020> driving<00:01:45.790> I

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
distraction of glass while driving I

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.120 
distraction of glass while driving I
think<00:01:47.480> they're<00:01:47.630> inaccurate<00:01:48.230> I<00:01:48.350> think<00:01:48.800> that

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
think they're inaccurate I think that

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.420 
think they're inaccurate I think that
the<00:01:49.400> people<00:01:49.610> who<00:01:50.030> are<00:01:50.780> against<00:01:51.590> glass<00:01:51.950> while

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
the people who are against glass while

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.330 
the people who are against glass while
driving<00:01:53.030> really<00:01:53.690> need<00:01:53.960> to<00:01:54.080> experience<00:01:54.770> glass

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
driving really need to experience glass

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.410 
driving really need to experience glass
while<00:01:55.670> driving<00:01:56.240> to<00:01:56.810> understand<00:01:58.060> that<00:01:59.060> many<00:01:59.270> of

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
while driving to understand that many of

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.190 
while driving to understand that many of
their<00:01:59.570> concerns<00:02:00.110> uh<00:02:00.850> have<00:02:01.850> no<00:02:02.030> merit<00:02:02.330> you<00:02:03.050> know

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
their concerns uh have no merit you know

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.190 
their concerns uh have no merit you know
with<00:02:03.680> what<00:02:03.830> they're<00:02:03.979> arguing<00:02:04.190> and<00:02:04.840> I<00:02:05.840> just
