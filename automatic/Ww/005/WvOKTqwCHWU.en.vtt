00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.370 
in order to start producing zealots as
quickly<00:01:39.390> as<00:01:39.570> possible<00:01:39.900> getting<00:01:40.350> that

quickly as possible getting that

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.020 
quickly as possible getting that
secondary<00:01:40.860> gateway<00:01:41.280> but<00:01:41.610> it's<00:01:41.729> going<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.880> be

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
secondary gateway but it's going to be

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.480 
secondary gateway but it's going to be
definitely<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.720> late<00:01:43.040> as<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.100> first

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
definitely you late as that first

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.130 
definitely you late as that first
gateway<00:01:44.909> will<00:01:45.090> probably<00:01:45.420> be<00:01:45.540> right<00:01:45.780> on<00:01:45.930> time

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
gateway will probably be right on time

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.139

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
that secondary gateway however is going

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.210 
that secondary gateway however is going
to<00:01:48.210> be<00:01:48.299> seriously<00:01:48.810> too<00:01:49.049> late<00:01:49.259> play<00:01:49.710> dropping

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220

gonna supply lock a play if he's not
careful<00:02:39.010> losing<00:02:39.579> some<00:02:39.730> probes<00:02:40.000> so<00:02:40.120> taking<00:02:40.329> a

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:40.359 
careful losing some probes so taking a

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:42.149 
careful losing some probes so taking a
look<00:02:40.389> at<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.599> losses<00:02:40.959> to<00:02:41.139> three<00:02:41.769> and<00:02:41.950> one

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:42.159 
look at the losses to three and one

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:43.860 
look at the losses to three and one
right<00:02:42.370> now<00:02:42.489> those<00:02:42.879> early<00:02:43.239> probes<00:02:43.599> that<00:02:43.719> are

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
right now those early probes that are

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.589 
right now those early probes that are
created<00:02:44.799> do<00:02:44.950> not<00:02:45.159> count<00:02:45.489> towards<00:02:46.419> any
