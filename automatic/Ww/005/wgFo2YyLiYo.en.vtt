as you can see it's Colquitt color I

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.150 
as you can see it's Colquitt color I
picked<00:00:15.030> it<00:00:15.120> up<00:00:15.210> at<00:00:15.450> home<00:00:15.480> depot<00:00:16.080> which<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:17.039> don't

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
picked it up at home depot which I don't

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.370 
picked it up at home depot which I don't
know<00:00:17.340> if<00:00:17.430> that's<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.730> store<00:00:18.090> that<00:00:18.390> um<00:00:18.960> people

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
know if that's a store that um people

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.759 
know if that's a store that um people
outside<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.279> US<00:00:20.580> um<00:00:21.060> have<00:00:21.779> but<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.170> imagine

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
outside of the US um have but I imagine

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.170 
outside of the US um have but I imagine
you<00:00:22.859> could<00:00:22.980> somehow<00:00:23.189> get<00:00:23.490> on<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.820> internet

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
you could somehow get on the internet

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.359 
you could somehow get on the internet
but<00:00:24.449> who<00:00:24.720> knows<00:00:25.160> um<00:00:26.160> so<00:00:27.150> basically<00:00:27.830> um<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:29.220> is

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
but who knows um so basically um it is

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.139 
but who knows um so basically um it is
very<00:00:29.970> fast<00:00:30.300> drying<00:00:30.599> all<00:00:31.170> purpose<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:32.149> the

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
very fast drying all purpose and the

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.580 
very fast drying all purpose and the
only<00:00:33.300> downside<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:33.870> could<00:00:34.079> think<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.559> maybe

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
only downside I could think of is maybe

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.459 
only downside I could think of is maybe
a<00:00:34.920> dingy<00:00:35.190> enamel<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:35.790> don't<00:00:36.120> know<00:00:36.270> if<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.350> will

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
a dingy enamel I don't know if that will

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.560 
a dingy enamel I don't know if that will
create<00:00:37.739> any<00:00:37.980> problems<00:00:38.340> in<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.489> future<00:00:38.670> but<00:00:39.510> I

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
create any problems in the future but I

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.880 
create any problems in the future but I
do<00:00:39.690> know<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.230> think<00:00:40.500> some<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.770> the

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
do know that I think some of the

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.500 
do know that I think some of the
characteristics<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.610> an<00:00:41.760> enamel<00:00:42.120> paint<00:00:42.300> would

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
characteristics of an enamel paint would

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.319 
characteristics of an enamel paint would
be<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.840> it's<00:00:43.020> kind<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.410> hard<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.940> maybe<00:00:44.940> strip

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
be that it's kind of hard to maybe strip

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.410 
be that it's kind of hard to maybe strip
