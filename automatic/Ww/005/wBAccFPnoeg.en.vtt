 Prove the ownership right of your site in the google search console 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.000
 Hi, I'm Mayley 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.300
 I am a member of the Google Webmaster Support Team, here 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.660
 To help you choose the right style to activate 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.240
 Webmaster Tools is the easiest way for you 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.180
 All the methods described in this video can lead to the same 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.390
 Successful activation 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.390
 Once you've chosen a particular route, please do so 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.570
 Go to the resources available to guide you through 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.250
 Specific activation process. 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.680
 Your proof of ownership of your site in Webmaster Tools (Webmaster Tools) 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.610
 Google provides you with a secure channel to give and 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.570
 Information reception. 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.670
 For example, Google can show you the most specific information 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.920
 Such as search queries that bring 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.280
 Visitors to your site 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.660
 By proving the right of ownership, you will have privileges to do 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.020
 Things like adjusting geographic settings 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.580
 To link your site with an audience 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.620
 Country. 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.020
 Checking ownership does not affect the performance of your site 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.090
 Google search results 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.850
 Now, you're likely to add your site to the Webmaster Tool 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.630
 Your site is where you tell your friends or your customers 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.810
 To see your contents, which must match what appears in 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.310
 Browser 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.030
 All types of sites are eligible for verification 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.090
 Of property with Google Webmaster Tools 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.560
 The site may include a subdomain name, such as 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.290
 mysite.example.com (domain) can be a domain without www 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.730
 E.g. www.example.com 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.980
 Or, for example, a domain without a www 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:47.860
 Or directory, such as www.example.com/mysite 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.760
 Or, www.example.com/subdirectory/mysite, or some 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.690
 Mix from the above. 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.690
 There are some situations, for example if you use Blogger, 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.100
 Google Sites, or Host or Service Provider Linked with Google 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.540
 Webmaster Tool, When Your Site Is Automatic 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.520
 Checking for you. 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.880
 All you need to do is set up and start exploring Webmaster Tools 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.990
 If not, let's review the right way 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.180
 You have to verify the property right. 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.900
 Checking ownership means your proof of Google 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.500
 In fact, the site owns, and is not, for example, a competitor 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.910
 You are trying to access statistics and values 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.160
 informations . 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.930
 For owners of novice sites, especially if you 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.680
 You have not had the chance to try it before, check ownership can be 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.220
 A little complicated 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.610
 The good news is that once you prove the property for the 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.750
 You can easily delegate others to manage 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.800
 Your site without going through the same process 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.680
 There are many ways to prove ownership. 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.400
 There is a recommended way 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.200
 Being the easiest 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.860
 Then after, there are also many alternative ways. 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.690
 For those who own the acne from sites to check them, like 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.124
 Multinational sites that have labels like de.example.com, 

00:03:08.124 --> 00:03:13.750
 jp.example.com and to transfer us.example.com you can select 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.890
 The Domain Provider Name option 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.240
 If you do not see your service provider list, choose "Other" 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.610
 For all other website owners, let's look at this drop down list 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.520
 Please find your service provider 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.970
 Or registered service, which often 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.770
 Where you purchased the domain and 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.710
 Where you hosted your site 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.780
 If you see your service provider choose on request 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.310
 The instructions are always included 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.310
 The easiest way to prove ownership. 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.200
 If you do not see your service provider, or this is the way 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.120
 Not successful for you, so let's talk about the HTML file 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.290
 How to upload data 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.990
 Uploading an HTML file is a good option for those who can 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.900
 Easily upload files to root directory and that means 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.960
 The first or primary guide to their site 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.950
 For example, if my website www.example.com I will 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.300
 Upload the HTML file to my root directory at 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.790
 www.example.com/-- 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.750
 Then put my file here 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.089
 Or, if my site is named mysite.example.c 

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:25.230
 om / subdirectory, then it will be my root directory 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.480
 mysite.example.c 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.970
 om / subdirectory-- 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.940
 Then name the file here 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.830
 If your site owner can upload files either from 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.000
 Site management tool or by FTP or terminal or shell connection 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.700
 Uploading an HTML file then may be an excellent option for you 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.040
 Another option to verify ownership is to add 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.520
 HTML data and descriptive "meta tag" 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.660
 If you compose writing html codes on the web 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.110
 For your pages, then it would be an excellent choice for you 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.120
 Finally, if your site is already using Google Analytics and 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.960
 You are responsible for it, see for verification methods 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.720
 Google Analytics 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.680
 Every way we covered it has its own steps 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.860
 To guide you through the process 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.590
 When it is checked, you will see 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.220
 The password succeeded on the screen 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.840
 Now, when you log into the Webmaster tool you will notice 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.770
 Your site shows site management instead of "not verified" 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.240
 For sites newly verified, you may see that 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.870
 Too much data has yet to appear 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.200
 But if you return within a few days you will notice 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.300
 More interesting data for your attention 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.580
 This covers all verification methods 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.450
 We hope we have been able to clarify the easier ways 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.460
 You have to prove the property right 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.710
 thanks for watching
