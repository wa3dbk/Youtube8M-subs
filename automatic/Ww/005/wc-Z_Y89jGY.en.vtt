 mena roller dot com presents you 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:14.000
 online skating tutorials learn 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:16.089
 to skate back lemons is the 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.279
 first exercise that we will execute 

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:21.999
 we put together the tips we separated the 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.589
 heels and flex the knees 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:28.909
 always with the night's precaution of 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:31.970
 body forward means lemons is 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:34.790
 same as the previous exercise but in 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.850
 this time we will do it with one foot 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.580
 we must do impulse series with the 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:44.330
 right foot and other series with the foot 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:46.600
 left crossing with one foot is the 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:50.240
 next exercise to perform 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.910
 we advance one foot and cross the other 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:57.140
 foot stays straight and moves forward following 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:59.120
 a line crossing with both feet this 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.120
 exercise will turn out to be something else 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.449
 complicated since we will cross so much with 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.950
 the right foot as with the left foot 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.990
 we will do series 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.990
 those that the right foot will be the 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:16.520
 advanced and others in which the 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:19.299
 left turns back once we have 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.869
 managed to move backwards 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:25.130
 we will learn to rotate through crosses 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.259
 we will describe circles that we will go 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.840
 increasing in size as 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:34.009
 let's have more security 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.200
 we will make circles in both directions and 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:40.250
 the change will be made through a 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:43.280
 light practical stop and practice until 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.709
 get total security if you do not 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.490
 you get to the first try you do not get 

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:51.799
 discourage and come back trying 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.950
 arms will move in the same way that 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:57.319
 when we go forward and we look 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.849
 back on the same side towards the 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:00.849
 which we turn the hip 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.890
 you have paid to learn to go in 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.619
 bicycle so do not pay for 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.460
 learn to skate just follow 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.460
