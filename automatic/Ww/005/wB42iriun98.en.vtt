and<00:03:57.220> you<00:03:57.340> loosen<00:03:57.850> the<00:03:58.000> screw<00:03:58.299> just<00:03:59.260> enough

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
and you loosen the screw just enough

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.340 
and you loosen the screw just enough
times<00:04:00.160> so<00:04:00.609> that<00:04:01.420> it<00:04:01.570> comes<00:04:01.780> out<00:04:02.019> of<00:04:02.230> the

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.349 
times so that it comes out of the
cylinder<00:04:02.620> so<00:04:03.609> that<00:04:03.700> you<00:04:03.820> can<00:04:03.970> just<00:04:04.180> put<00:04:04.329> a

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
cylinder so that you can just put a

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:06.210 
cylinder so that you can just put a
screwdriver<00:04:04.690> or<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:05.350> key<00:04:05.560> in<00:04:05.650> the<00:04:05.799> cylinder

screw does that side of the door you

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.800 
screw does that side of the door you
don't<00:04:12.459> unloosen<00:04:12.940> and<00:04:13.060> bolt<00:04:13.239> you<00:04:13.510> only<00:04:13.630> need

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
don't unloosen and bolt you only need

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.680 
don't unloosen and bolt you only need
the<00:04:13.959> one<00:04:14.170> screw<00:04:14.920> that<00:04:15.160> faces<00:04:16.150> the<00:04:16.329> side<00:04:16.539> of<00:04:16.630> the

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
the one screw that faces the side of the

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.360 
the one screw that faces the side of the
cylinder<00:04:16.989> you're<00:04:17.229> working<00:04:17.530> at<00:04:17.680> so

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
cylinder you're working at so

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.130 
cylinder you're working at so
screwdriver<00:04:19.000> I<00:04:19.150> find<00:04:19.390> the<00:04:19.510> slide<00:04:19.780> of<00:04:19.959> the<00:04:20.019> head

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
screwdriver I find the slide of the head

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.800 
screwdriver I find the slide of the head
of<00:04:20.260> the<00:04:20.350> screw<00:04:20.650> and<00:04:20.970> turn<00:04:21.970> the<00:04:22.180> screw<00:04:22.419> just<00:04:22.659> a

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
of the screw and turn the screw just a

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.140 
of the screw and turn the screw just a
couple<00:04:23.110> of<00:04:23.200> turns<00:04:23.440> I<00:04:23.680> don't<00:04:23.860> get<00:04:24.039> to<00:04:24.250> and<00:04:24.490> I<00:04:24.940> put

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
couple of turns I don't get to and I put

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.740 
couple of turns I don't get to and I put
a<00:04:25.180> screwdriver<00:04:25.510> because<00:04:25.960> now<00:04:26.110> the<00:04:26.169> cylinder

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
a screwdriver because now the cylinder

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.279 
a screwdriver because now the cylinder
unscrew<00:04:28.750> is<00:04:28.900> relatively<00:04:29.410> easy<00:04:30.720> we<00:04:31.720> take<00:04:32.199> it

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:32.289 
unscrew is relatively easy we take it

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:34.590 
unscrew is relatively easy we take it
out<00:04:32.410> of<00:04:32.440> the<00:04:32.560> door<00:04:32.880> that's<00:04:33.880> all<00:04:34.120> there<00:04:34.270> is<00:04:34.300> to

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
out of the door that's all there is to

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.309 
out of the door that's all there is to
it<00:04:34.770> that<00:04:35.770> little<00:04:35.979> set<00:04:36.250> screw<00:04:36.280> in<00:04:36.669> there<00:04:36.880> and

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:37.319 
it that little set screw in there and

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:40.260 
it that little set screw in there and
you<00:04:38.319> don't<00:04:38.590> need<00:04:38.889> to<00:04:38.949> take<00:04:39.430> the<00:04:39.610> set<00:04:39.819> screw<00:04:40.090> out

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
you don't need to take the set screw out

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.300 
you don't need to take the set screw out
too<00:04:40.630> far<00:04:40.900> because<00:04:41.440> if<00:04:41.620> you<00:04:41.710> take<00:04:41.949> the<00:04:42.099> set

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
too far because if you take the set

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.210 
too far because if you take the set
screw<00:04:42.550> out<00:04:42.639> too<00:04:42.880> far<00:04:43.150> it<00:04:43.419> can<00:04:43.599> fall<00:04:43.930> down<00:04:44.220> into

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
screw out too far it can fall down into

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.040 
screw out too far it can fall down into
the<00:04:45.340> door<00:04:45.550> so<00:04:46.090> you<00:04:46.150> only<00:04:46.300> need<00:04:46.509> to<00:04:46.599> loosen<00:04:46.960> it

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
the door so you only need to loosen it

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.830 
the door so you only need to loosen it
just<00:04:47.259> enough<00:04:48.099> to<00:04:48.250> get<00:04:48.370> the<00:04:48.550> cylinder<00:04:48.849> out<00:04:48.970> once

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
just enough to get the cylinder out once

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.110 
just enough to get the cylinder out once
you<00:04:49.930> get<00:04:50.020> the<00:04:50.199> cylinder<00:04:50.500> out<00:04:50.759> for<00:04:51.759> one<00:04:51.910> reason

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
you get the cylinder out for one reason

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.820 
you get the cylinder out for one reason
or<00:04:52.270> another<00:04:52.360> you<00:04:52.599> need<00:04:52.810> to<00:04:52.930> rekey<00:04:53.349> this<00:04:53.560> to<00:04:53.800> a

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
or another you need to rekey this to a

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.920 
or another you need to rekey this to a
new<00:04:54.009> key<00:04:54.280> instead<00:04:54.669> of<00:04:54.759> buying<00:04:54.940> new<00:04:55.090> lock<00:04:55.509> new
