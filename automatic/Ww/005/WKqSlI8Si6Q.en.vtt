 pkt file downloads downloads the 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.720

 place in a folder in your sd memory 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.420
 card 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.739
 once the ingredients have been downloaded or 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.420
 the applications we are going to install the 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.699
 point files apk for that we're going 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.190
 through a file explorer to the 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.750
 sd card let's go to the folder where 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.250
 we have our applications and we are going to 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.680
 proceed to install the then 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.320
 we install the application of time or 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.720
 weather we give you install we hope that 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.540
 finalize its installation we see that here 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.180
 says finished now we install the 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.360
 circle widget we select it we give it 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.720
 install 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.730
 and we see that it has finished and finally 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.200
 we install our launcher or home 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.090
 screen that we are seeing here in this 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.290
 If I have it installed so I 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.910
 he says he's going to replace it so I'm going 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.520
 to cancel you install it from this 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.500
 same way once we have our 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.900
 installed applications we just have to 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.729
 press the home button and we will 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.140
 select our logo in this case 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.810
 called main screen what 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.710
 we select activate it and 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.750
 we enter the environment of this one a lot 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.280
 offered by the motorola launcher 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.229
 droid be good that is a launcher 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.150
 pretty fast and if I move towards 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.630
 the right part let's see what I'm going to 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.490
 find 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.250
 the page manager or screens 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.440
 where can I add or delete a 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.259
 screen if I wish so let's go here the 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.840
 administrator and we see that the one that adds 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.710
 I'm going to eliminate it and in this way we're going 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.540
 managing the screens of our 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.429
 phone if it's going to be the left part 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.410
 we see that we are going to find some 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.330
 fast configurations for example 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.880
 activate or deactivate the bell 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.640
 phone activate or deactivate the wifi the 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.830
 bluetooth and so on if we go to the drawer 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.410
 of applications we press here we see 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.269
 which is similar to any launcher or 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.310
 rom with ice cream installed 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.410
 sandwich or jelly bean if we go to the 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.570
 right part we will find ourselves with 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.700
 the option to add the widgets and if 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.800
 let's go to the left we're going to 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.930
 add this function where we can 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.850
 add our favorite apps 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.959
 for that we press add we see that 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.080
 a list is displayed and for example 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.569
 we select some of here is this 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.400
 this is ready and we see that it 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.810
 have added so well here I'm going to 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.190
 have my applications and here is going to have 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.050
 my favorite applications 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.610
 well we already knew the blog that was now 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.810
 let's start customizing this 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.340
 phone first let's start 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.470
 placing a wallpaper so 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.170
 as an explorer we go to the folder where 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.400
 we have the funds we select the one that 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.310
 more we like in this case I'm going to 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.280
 select this 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.380
 we open it and we just give it menu 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.630
 to the phone and we give you establish how 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.640
 wallpaper here, what do you 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.540
 size if you want and just 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.219
 you have to save 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.960
 we see that here the 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:27.310
 changes and if I go to my main screen 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:29.500
 we see that I already have my background applied 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.970
 now let's place the clock or the 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.739
 widget that is so here to this 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.630
 personalization for that we press the 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.849
 button to go to the application drawer 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.650
 we go to the widgets section and here 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:40.270
 let's find the circles widget 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.459
 we see that here is simply what 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.720
 we press and we will place it in the 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.030
 screen that we want in this 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.590
 I'm going to leave it here and we see that 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.360
 displays a list where we are going to 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.000
 select our widget to be able to 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.220
 set up we're definitely going to 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.730
 look for it here we see that it is 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:00.100
 these sides here is my widget we see 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:03.010
 that is called circle we press it and 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:06.140
 boom we see that it is placed in all the 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.090
 screen of our phone 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.800
 good this widget is that it's pretty 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.810
 interactive the first thing we're going to do 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.030
 is to press the middle circle to 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.280
 add our city we press it 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:19.579
 we see and here it tells us current location 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.709
 we activate this option and we see that 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.330
 already if we go backwards we see that 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.190
 I would like to configure our city and we 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.040
 will show then the current climate if it 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:31.010
 pressed and we see that it shows us already the 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.720
 weather in this way and then 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.220
 here shows us by the state or the 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.960
 time as it will be in the 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.700
 next days after having 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.410
 configured our city we can 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.730
 interact with the other circles by 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.380
 example if we go to this circle that is 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:45.169
 bigger we see that there is a clock 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.720
 digital but if I slide half over 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:50.570
 the boom we see that happens to a clock 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.460
 analogous here in this smaller circle 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.440
 we can see the percentage of the battery 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.500
 that we have left in our phone but 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.910
 If I slide, we see that we are going to 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.280
 the configuration options 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.050
 If I press here we will enter the 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.970
 configuration options of our 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.400
 widget then take it out we can configure 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.590
 as we want, I go back and 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.169
 if he did it again we went to the state of 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.129
 the battery and if you selected it we see that 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:14.929
 let's go to the state 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:17.119
 the theory is going to show us the options 

00:05:14.929 --> 00:05:19.489
 of how our 

00:05:17.119 --> 00:05:21.860
 battery we can remove as much 

00:05:19.489 --> 00:05:24.349
 consume on the screen and others in 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:27.019
 applications more in this way then 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:30.889
 We can configure our phone with 

00:05:27.019 --> 00:05:32.709
 this style so it's a pretty style 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:35.539
 that makes our phone look great 

00:05:32.709 --> 00:05:37.429
 as we see it is very easy to have the william 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:38.839
 and the appearance of the motorola droid way 

00:05:37.429 --> 00:05:40.489
 to be the only drawback is that 

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:42.589
 you must necessarily have the launcher 

00:05:40.489 --> 00:05:44.239
 of motorola because if it does not it is not going to 

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:46.459
 operate the widget I have tried 

00:05:44.239 --> 00:05:47.830
 place the widget with other launcher and 

00:05:46.459 --> 00:05:49.969
 the truth that has not worked 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.679
 remember this nest you liked 

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:54.019

 and as I have always said a good what a 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.770
 Being can not be complete if it does not count 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.120
 with good effects good then we go 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:15.259
 to apply those effects for that 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.259
 I unlock my phone 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.040
 and press the menu button
