00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.060
 or not 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.330
 hello videos welcome to rope 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.310
 berta dotcom aquitano longhitano in 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.370
 this video we will learn to play the 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:38.520
 song the chords of the song together 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.140
 next to pappo's and a song very 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.930
 very simple we are going to learn only 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.640
 the chords and it's a great song to 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.620
 play an electric guitar as with 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.970
 acoustic guitar in this case I have my 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.590
 electric guitar so let's go to 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.300
 learn it here but if you have a 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.250
 acoustic guitar or whatever it is also 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.900
 they will be able to play well let's bring the 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.580
 camera back in this song and in 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.940
 this song is very simple let's see 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.310
 only the chords 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.120
 in the first chord 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:07.130
 is 29 if the agreement is formed in the indy 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.410
 forms very much seemed the greater sun with the 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.050
 difference is that these two go a 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:15.230
 rope below we place the 22 on the 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:18.580
 fret 3 on the fifth string the finger on 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:22.130
 the fret 2 on the fourth string 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:25.640
 then we played third string in the air of 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:30.040
 23 on the fret 3 second string and 24 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.040
 while t 3 in the 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.250
 first agreement 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.620
 then first the first part will be 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:43.260
 and he sings and the first chord he has is 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.260
 the next one is 29 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.690
 and then what we do is a trainer 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.570
 it is very easy this change of the video that 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.450
 we have only to lift the finger 2 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.020
 towards 6 remember from finger 1 towards 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.020
 fifth string 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.859
 well we passed in the minor 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.240
 and the least 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.850
 we do it when one enters this one 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.570
 second rope fingers in the tract 2 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.870
 fourth string and 23 fret 23 and of 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.870
 rope 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:28.040
 we do it rowing 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:33.380
 of 132 third string of 22 fret 2 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.380
 first string and gave 3 fret 13 14 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.990
 then we make soldering iron 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.780
 those are the three chords that they have with 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.750
 respect to the rhythm 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:50.600
 what we are going to try to do 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.600
 rhythm would be the next such tal 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.270
 it would be down down up up 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.950
 down 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.610
 slowly obviously because it 's a 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.610
 slow song 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.790
 up up 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.790
 down 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.790
 but what we can do to vary 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.410
 why we can not touch 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.960
 quietly like that without more and we are 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.040
 taking alone and singing it but also 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.040
 that has the song is touching 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.129
 how to do the rhythm but not touch all 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.780
 the strings the guitar but touch type 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:41.319
 arpeggio then we do as the rhythm 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.319
 in series is 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.060
 in this case touch third second and 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.630
 third string and then he made a ray for 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.610
 down that only fourth and third 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:56.470
 those are variations that can go 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.470
 doing the very simple 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.990
 think the arpeggio with the rhythm with the 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.810
 rhythm that we would commonly do and when 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.970
 the song will pass chorus 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.680
 it tends to rise we can do the rhythm 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.680
 complete then we do 2 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:25.620
 twice rich in everything 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:27.979
 in this case and then the minor moves 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.979
 rhythm 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.570
 and they are 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:38.129
 and so many sun rays 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:42.509
 29 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:45.529
 and a rabid and we cut back sing 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:45.529
 and we start the round 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.290
 the 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.290
 and the least 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.210
 3 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.400
 and they are 

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:12.550
 yes 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.100
 and the chorus is just as well 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:18.820
 and it 's exactly always the same 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.290
 chord progression good friends I hope 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.600
