until Sasuke I had primarily played like
young<00:04:18.030> naive<00:04:18.900> hero<00:04:19.230> types<00:04:19.739> and<00:04:20.010> so<00:04:20.640> Sasuke<00:04:21.000> was

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
young naive hero types and so Sasuke was

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.460 
young naive hero types and so Sasuke was
