00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
think that overcompensating something

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.509 
think that overcompensating something
maybe<00:02:08.259> because<00:02:08.619> these<00:02:08.739> new<00:02:08.950> noodles<00:02:09.340> are

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
maybe because these new noodles are

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.119 
maybe because these new noodles are
terrible<00:02:10.119> at<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:11.019> bottom<00:02:11.319> that<00:02:11.439> says<00:02:11.680> I<00:02:11.920> made

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:12.129 
terrible at the bottom that says I made

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.339 
terrible at the bottom that says I made
in<00:02:12.310> Malaysia<00:02:12.669> I<00:02:13.150> think<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.659> original<00:02:13.900> rules

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
in Malaysia I think the original rules

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.280 
in Malaysia I think the original rules
were<00:02:14.620> made<00:02:14.829> in<00:02:14.980> China<00:02:15.370> this<00:02:16.180> obviously<00:02:16.870> means

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
were made in China this obviously means

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.500 
were made in China this obviously means
that<00:02:17.530> Neji<00:02:17.980> have<00:02:18.159> some<00:02:18.340> new<00:02:18.519> slave<00:02:18.939> camp<00:02:19.360> in

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
that Neji have some new slave camp in

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.809 
that Neji have some new slave camp in
Malaysia<00:02:19.900> can<00:02:20.620> make<00:02:20.829> the<00:02:21.040> noodles<00:02:21.400> for<00:02:21.609> a<00:02:21.670> lot

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
Malaysia can make the noodles for a lot

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.209 
Malaysia can make the noodles for a lot
cheaper<00:02:22.120> there<00:02:22.540> this<00:02:23.260> is<00:02:23.469> the<00:02:23.650> new<00:02:23.799> noodle

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:24.219

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.990 
they say it's made in Malaysia but what
they<00:02:26.799> really<00:02:27.099> mean<00:02:27.280> is<00:02:27.459> that<00:02:27.549> it's<00:02:27.730> made<00:02:27.969> in

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.880 
they really mean is that it's made in
Taiwan<00:02:28.659> because<00:02:28.900> it<00:02:29.140> looks<00:02:29.319> like<00:02:29.500> it's<00:02:29.680> made

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
Taiwan because it looks like it's made

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.849 
Taiwan because it looks like it's made
of<00:02:29.920> damn<00:02:30.280> plastic<00:02:31.000> some<00:02:31.959> people<00:02:32.260> like<00:02:32.500> to<00:02:32.709> eat

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:32.859 
of damn plastic some people like to eat

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:34.800

the<00:02:33.069> old<00:02:33.250> noodle<00:02:33.579> cake<00:02:33.879> rule<00:02:34.239> and<00:02:34.480> they<00:02:34.599> can't

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
the old noodle cake rule and they can't

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.330 
the old noodle cake rule and they can't
do<00:02:35.049> that<00:02:35.200> now<00:02:35.379> because<00:02:35.409> it<00:02:35.769> would<00:02:35.890> taste<00:02:36.159> like

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
do that now because it would taste like

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.780 
do that now because it would taste like
eating<00:02:36.909> a<00:02:37.000> plastic<00:02:37.629> bowl<00:02:37.989> in<00:02:38.739> fact<00:02:39.189> the<00:02:39.579> bowl

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
eating a plastic bowl in fact the bowl

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.910 
eating a plastic bowl in fact the bowl
probably<00:02:40.510> tastes<00:02:40.989> better<00:02:41.170> than<00:02:41.409> the<00:02:41.590> noodle

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
probably tastes better than the noodle

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.390 
probably tastes better than the noodle
