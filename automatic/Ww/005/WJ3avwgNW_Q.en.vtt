00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:09.189
 good 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.800
 well it's everybody knows at 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.510
 mayor I hope you all go super 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.090
 well but today we find ourselves on 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.590
 big theft auto 5 on a new glitch 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.630
 which is really huge I thank 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.580
 first punch for showing me in the 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.989
 door and you will see his nickname he 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.880
 could not the ropes he contacted me 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.070
 this reality gaming it is really great 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.540
 this glitch then you will need a 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.710
 motorcycle powerful enough we can do it 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.460
 with all the motorcycles but I you 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.460
 advise to have there 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.769
 swala sanchez or be there a little bit 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.469
 what's the name that I have between 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:03.320
 hands and you must have a 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.210
 parachute and resources to eat 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.100
 to be able to go back to life because 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.560
 that you will need to have apnea 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.619
 and if you do not have these baths you 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.140
 will die during the glitch then you 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.570
 have been able to see you must dark with your 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.670
 motorcycle against the pillar as you could 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.110
 I want to show them anyway you 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.820
 go on the pillar you will fall 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.170
 must your motorcycle crushes you admits 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.490
 rising you will fall into sun and 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.899
 no me the short one would not even say that 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.530
 southbridge because behind you me 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:32.330
 see me say that it looks like the 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.590
 low point it's natural behind it 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.970
 there is no bug and here we can see 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.069
 that there is water under the map and that's 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.119
 where is going to play the glitch so there I 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:39.229
 will x dream me the first time because 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.270
 we did not know what to do 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.679
 then we must jump triggered 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.450
 directly on parachute so cross and 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:46.580
 then triangle directly and wait 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.640
 four seconds with his parachute towards 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.369
 the top and we quickly go back to the surface 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.200
 in the parachute song and if you 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.549
 jump on the parachute and ben you 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.840
 go die a dish in the water and 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.410
 you're going to die like a big shit 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.060
 and here is where the glitch is played 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.200
 which is really hard and the cost of 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.819
 motorcycle is pretty hard too 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.470
 but you have to have a little luck and 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:07.580
 after a while it passes and there you 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.750
 see that I really have a lot of 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.160
 luck because I was going to die like 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.739
 I made myself a character who 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.510
 had no apnea at all, and here we are 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.920
 is really in a beautiful autumn 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.690
 before end boal briche 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.600
 I do not know about you but this game has you 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.850
 really cool and 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.130
 I will follow him showing him a little 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.640
 how to get out of the rich web 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:30.850
 it will be necessary to go towards the beach I 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.960
 would of course put the map but hey this 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.750
 place is really well known it is 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:37.300
 the bridge next to the base 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.580
 military and there he will show at the beach 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.360
 like what here wanted to swim a little in 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.650
 emptiness and people see you 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.180
 to swim in it you have to just have the 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.100
 head to the surface so favor it goes 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.050
 must slow down here and there we will arrive 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.500
 at the beach and there he goes to see one go there 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.930
 too fast 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:54.040
 but if we leave our head just at the 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.950
 beach surface we will be able to swim 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.800
 in the air this is making funny clips 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.110
 I do not know and the little subtlety in 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.400
 this shore the the shore you come 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.960
 see the opposite bank in fact the 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.250
 be able to bridge the opposite bank for 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.100
 retrieve a parachute you have a 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.550
 helicopter and so is you go up in 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.440
 you lift it at 2 meters altitude 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.200
 and you're going to have more parachutes 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.640
 quickly here I go back a 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.320
 second time the glitch then one is 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.300
 completely immune from the cops 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.800
 enemies our balls all our balls 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.070
 pass through the walls through the 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.990
 roads 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:30.400
 so here I show I show the hall 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.690
 she was more accessible helicopter 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.569
 I do not know why anymore but I'm going to 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.180
 show the 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:39.519
 the two bullets and two friends who were 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.959
 with me so puncher maÃ© who had 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.870
 managed to make the glitch leave by train 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.580
 to swim like it hurts read him 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.019
 to swim well but I saw him small 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.330
 like that so it's pretty funny 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:52.780
 that's past it's always nice to 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:55.660
 see a little pitch as fun and who 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:58.420
 could not so much play and there 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:01.480
 you will see there the part where live 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.989
 can shoot rpg7 through and make 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.849
 all fart 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.640
 there you really see that the bleach is 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:08.140
 really impressive there I found 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.530
 it could not see that there really was 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.810
 impacts that are getting there I'm going out 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.670
 the air pg 7 you'll see that the shell 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.199
 went well and it went well 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:22.419
 through and smashed the entire population 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:24.610
 alas the very very important glitch very 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.930
 difficult finally difficult 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.260
 once we got the hang of it and ben 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:32.470
 it's good but then you jump 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.690
 press extra directly jump you 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.370
 so here you go see what I 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.080
 I had been where I had rhdp theory 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.030
 g7 I jumped without triggering the 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.789
 parachuting was crushed so I jumped 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.789
 it's gone then there you are jumping 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:50.669
 directly triggered the parachute and 4 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:52.630
 seconds 1 2 3 4 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:54.130
 so here we fall into the water and we 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.840
 goes back says on the surface now 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.130
 possible and there normally if you 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.220
 do this manipulation in the world 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.789
 you have a lot of life and that's it 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.789
 welcome for you 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.790
 after I created this new account 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.410
 psn you can add if you want 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.370
 play with me I glitch a little but 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.410
 it's not really my hobby 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.169
 you will tell you about my non 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.550
 no I can a lot of glitch but the 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:16.870
 that's how there are some very beautiful 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.870
 it's not that I'm going away a little 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:22.630
 of time and see the video is going to be 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.970
 proposed to chanac fr so so mu claude 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:29.169
 a big thank you to them well I'm on 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:32.139
 their public forums as well and there 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.160
 he will tell me to really move forward more 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:35.410
 of almond because otherwise we could 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.550
 get out of the veil breach and that's it 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.979
 a lot of work for nothing since I 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.889
 you repeat the the glitch hard enough to the 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:43.120
 realization is there we can see 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:45.430
 that they are swimming in the void 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.199
 no it would be a little bit there 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.729
 I 'll do it two days after that 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:51.370
 will not walk anymore 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:54.250
 young age young age here is the room 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.180
 do a little bit and rim 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.330
 he sees me he sees me downright 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:00.070
 dangerous because the characters are 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:03.639
 really buggy there I come you want too 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:05.470
 strong and I'm coming out of blick we're going soon 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:08.400
 end up at the end of at the end of the 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:12.010
 video there are links to the map that I'm showing 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.449
 here is the right bank laos felice the shore 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.039
 left where is the helicopter 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:16.300
 to recover the parachute so 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:18.610
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.080
 if you see the video on richie fr and 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.770
 well you can check my chain go 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.770
 bye everyone
