00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:14.969
 just the world of freeride ski tests and 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:18.660
 today's agenda is scott mashed potatoes or purees 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.810
 clean I do not know skiing has long been tested 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.600
 not for the first time, and I have long been with 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.820
 they know a little bit about them 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.609
 too already remind some hackneyed 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.289
 fights in general yes let's get to the point 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.809
 now skis i would say so i would 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.579
 classified it and by parameters and here 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.210
 ride on it you tied her 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.719
 still as universal above 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.700
 universally uly zhuz 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.250
 slightly enlarged under your feet in 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.340
 side freerider but this is not freeride on and 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.739
 ski it probably even chooses them 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.260
 generalists this is more universal ski 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.050
 crazy about ski for those who ride more 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.030
 on the slope rides confidently on the slope with 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.640
 they are all well they keep well 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.030
 not good fig they pass bumps 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.159
 exactly give good to go with peak 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.040
 slippage will be heard so here for 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.740
 good speed that is such 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:14.310
 about giant style on giants 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.380
 from the mountains work fine due to 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.360
 some small technological 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.640
 some decisions back there on and 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.040
 pomegranate a little bit they really 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.620
 actually slightly improved behavior in 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.690
 virgin soil 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.980
 anyway good to real 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.980
 probable skis and they fall short 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.670
 thus, as it were to go as it is possible to 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.170
 such a good universal solution 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.740
 but you have to do this 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.740
 it's better after all for high speed for 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.200
 walking on the moves and the longitudinal moves 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.230
 slip that is for a quick ride on 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.830
 clean so sure it's not newbies and 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.990
 skis this skis for universal 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.990
 freeride including that is not for 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:05.700
 bottlenecks are not for fishing lines there is not for 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:08.369
 pebbles on the trails I do not know how that 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.290
 they will not be on the trails but even there 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.350
 where you can drop well I would also 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:16.440
 She would not have climbed it and for fields 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.810
 for expanses for expanse for wide 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.270
 long slopes with good maybe 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.130
 tilt can without good no matter but in 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.620
 in general, as a matter of fact, it is not clear 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.960
 again classification for baby well 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.350
 Basically if I have to watch your 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.020
 Tanet as truly universal 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.020
 I want to ride a visa a little bit clearly myself 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.660
 such would take 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.150
 probably from this category here such 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.500
 good on 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.640
 aimed at some nice skating 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.730
 generalists this skis are good 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:53.150
 although I know for sure what is better 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:55.580
 so put in the middle who do not 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.900
 agree that let him motivate like u 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.920
 honestly I do not know, I confused 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.840
 testimony attributed to them with one 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.290
 parties like fun on the slope but i would 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.420
 then took a giant to the sides in virgin soil 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.590
 also not very much because of 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.110
 good freeride skiing 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.240
 at night I do not know yet I can not say 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.520
 I will not recommend to anyone 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.050
 make a mistake so maybe think again 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:22.000
 him not to miss the next episode 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.000
 the channel is signed by everyone bye
