00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:12.759
 for everyone and I'm roxy and in this video I 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.540
 I'm going to teach how to do they are the a with 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:16.630
 your is 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.960
 super super super pretty and is super 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:24.220
 easy what works for us is a beige with 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:28.270
 a smash of black a white enamel a 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:32.140
 yellow enamel a coral enamel 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:36.420
 a red enamel a pink enamel a 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:41.410
 green glaze baking paper 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:43.870
 brochitas and dowries as first thing 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.230
 let's apply baseball for all 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.230
 nail 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.660
 then we are going to make a white base 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.579
 where we want to draw the sushis 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.039
 traditional 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.789
 a black base where we want to draw 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.789
 the maquis 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:15.079
 and a white triangle where we want 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.079
 make rice balls or onigiri 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.880
 now if we do not have a colored enamel 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.900
 salmon we can mix the coral enamel 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.760
 and the yellow enamel 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.860
 and then we're going to paint half a nail like that 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.660
 this will be the salmon there and not you 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.230
 worry if the color is not super 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:45.380
 because it's going to give it one more touch 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.380
 Realistic and ccoo 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.060
 and this will be the shrimp 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.899
 and if you want your shrimp to be still 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:12.210
 nicer you can add the tail and 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:16.170
 to make sushi with the egg not 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:18.810
 let's paint half a fingernail of yellow and 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.980
 to make sushi with tuna we are going to 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:25.680
 paint half fingernail red when everything 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.830
 will be dry let's paint some lines 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.310
 roses over the tuna the salmon and the 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.310
 shrimp 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.340
 then with black enamel or a down 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:55.310
 let's draw the sushi seaweed with the 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.310

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.280
 little eyes of all the sushis 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:27.120
 and with a brush or a down at the end 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.120
 let's add the mouths 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.930

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:41.300
