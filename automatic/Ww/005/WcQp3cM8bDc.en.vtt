the flip is a fake that means it's a

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.240 
the flip is a fake that means it's a

I<00:04:04.769> cats<00:04:05.100> are<00:04:05.340> slight<00:04:05.640> favorites<00:04:06.180> in<00:04:06.329> this<00:04:06.480> game

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
and another reason is that they beat

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.690 
and another reason is that they beat
