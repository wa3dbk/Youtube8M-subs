00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.130 

g'day<00:00:01.380> everybody<00:00:01.890> I<00:00:02.449> thought<00:00:03.449> I'd<00:00:03.629> put

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
g'day everybody I thought I'd put

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.740 
g'day everybody I thought I'd put
together<00:00:04.470> a<00:00:04.560> quick<00:00:05.100> tutorial<00:00:05.700> on<00:00:05.750> double

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
together a quick tutorial on double

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.160 
together a quick tutorial on double
doors<00:00:07.429> so<00:00:08.429> if<00:00:08.580> you've<00:00:08.760> tried<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:09.240> put<00:00:09.480> double

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
doors so if you've tried to put double

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.919 
doors so if you've tried to put double
doors<00:00:10.380> together<00:00:10.980> before<00:00:11.700> you<00:00:12.599> may<00:00:12.780> have

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
doors together before you may have

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.820 
doors together before you may have
gotten<00:00:13.200> this<00:00:14.599> where<00:00:15.599> one<00:00:15.809> door<00:00:16.049> is<00:00:16.410> always

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
gotten this where one door is always

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.710 
gotten this where one door is always
open<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.580> one<00:00:17.760> door<00:00:17.940> is<00:00:18.119> always<00:00:18.300> closed<00:00:20.720> the

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
open and one door is always closed the

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.189 
open and one door is always closed the
trouble<00:00:22.080> is<00:00:22.230> when<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:23.010> set<00:00:23.220> up<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.490> door<00:00:24.199> two

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
trouble is when you set up a door two

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.470 
trouble is when you set up a door two
doors<00:00:25.410> next<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.830> each<00:00:25.949> other<00:00:26.099> you're<00:00:26.910> creating

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
doors next to each other you're creating

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.750 
doors next to each other you're creating
a<00:00:27.570> circuit<00:00:27.990> or<00:00:28.590> one<00:00:28.800> side<00:00:29.279> needs<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.699> be

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
a circuit or one side needs to be

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.880 
a circuit or one side needs to be
positive<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:31.019> other<00:00:31.140> side<00:00:31.439> needs<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.800> be

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
positive and the other side needs to be

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.410 
positive and the other side needs to be
negative<00:00:32.870> so<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.989> way<00:00:34.110> we<00:00:34.290> achieve<00:00:34.680> this<00:00:35.420> is

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
negative so the way we achieve this is

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.229 
negative so the way we achieve this is
to<00:00:37.380> put<00:00:37.950> an<00:00:38.040> inverter<00:00:38.370> into<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.210> system<00:00:41.239> to

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
to put an inverter into the system to

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.110 
to put an inverter into the system to
invert<00:00:42.840> our<00:00:43.079> positive<00:00:43.350> our<00:00:44.040> negative<00:00:44.760> signal

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
invert our positive our negative signal

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.220 
invert our positive our negative signal
into<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.510> positive<00:00:45.989> signal<00:00:47.570> so<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.719> just<00:00:48.989> hang

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
into a positive signal so you just hang

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.270 
into a positive signal so you just hang
a<00:00:49.410> redstone<00:00:49.920> torch<00:00:50.190> off<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.789> block<00:00:51.539> like<00:00:51.989> that

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
a redstone torch off a block like that

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.850 
a redstone torch off a block like that
and<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.460> will<00:00:53.550> give<00:00:53.610> us<00:00:53.760> negative<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.260> our

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
and that will give us negative and our

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:05.149 
and that will give us negative and our
positive<00:01:02.750> so<00:01:03.750> now<00:01:03.930> we've<00:01:04.110> got<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.650> set<00:01:05.040> of

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
positive so now we've got a set of

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.700 
positive so now we've got a set of
double<00:01:05.309> doors<00:01:05.460> working<00:01:06.299> fine<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:07.200> trouble<00:01:07.560> is

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
double doors working fine the trouble is

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.609 
double doors working fine the trouble is
that<00:01:09.680> they<00:01:10.680> close<00:01:10.979> five<00:01:11.340> three<00:01:11.610> quick<00:01:12.619> unless

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
that they close five three quick unless

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.890 
that they close five three quick unless
you've<00:01:13.950> got<00:01:14.180> right<00:01:15.180> next<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.810> that

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
you've got right next to it and that

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.160 
you've got right next to it and that
presents<00:01:16.710> its<00:01:17.040> own<00:01:17.159> problems<00:01:20.570> so<00:01:21.570> what<00:01:22.080> we

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
presents its own problems so what we

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.620 
presents its own problems so what we
need<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.470> do<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:24.020> delay<00:01:26.360> the<00:01:27.360> opening

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
need to do is you to delay the opening

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.370 
need to do is you to delay the opening
of<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.080> doors<00:01:29.090> so<00:01:30.090> in<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.270> way<00:01:30.390> we<00:01:30.540> do<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.930> is

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.499 

to<00:01:34.579> slow<00:01:35.579> down<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.970> signal<00:01:37.970> so<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.119> best<00:01:39.270> way

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
to slow down the signal so the best way

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.319 
to slow down the signal so the best way
to<00:01:39.570> slow<00:01:39.960> down<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.290> signal<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:40.909> by<00:01:41.909> using<00:01:42.060> more

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
to slow down the signal is by using more

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:48.170 
to slow down the signal is by using more
inverters<00:01:43.610> each<00:01:44.610> time<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.119> signal<00:01:47.180> changes

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
inverters each time the signal changes

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.980 
inverters each time the signal changes
will<00:01:48.869> stitches<00:01:50.000> then<00:01:53.149> that's<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.299> cycle<00:01:54.810> and

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
will stitches then that's a cycle and

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.429 
will stitches then that's a cycle and
will<00:01:55.259> slow<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.920> whole<00:01:56.040> process<00:01:56.340> down<00:01:57.259> so<00:01:58.259> if

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
will slow the whole process down so if

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:05.550 
will slow the whole process down so if
use<00:01:58.649> for<00:01:59.159> in<00:01:59.399> here<00:02:01.189> which<00:02:02.189> is<00:02:02.399> not<00:02:02.579> many

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.729 

you<00:02:06.560> see<00:02:06.770> how<00:02:06.860> each<00:02:07.070> time<00:02:07.630> its<00:02:08.630> inverted<00:02:08.959> so<00:02:09.619> an

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
you see how each time its inverted so an

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:16.110 
you see how each time its inverted so an
on<00:02:09.890> signal<00:02:10.160> to<00:02:10.849> an<00:02:10.940> off<00:02:11.030> signal<00:02:12.130> anyway<00:02:13.130> Oh

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:30.759 

Chuck<00:02:17.120> our<00:02:17.330> suite<00:02:17.660> here<00:02:29.290> so<00:02:30.290> you<00:02:30.350> might<00:02:30.620> be

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
Chuck our suite here so you might be

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.380 
Chuck our suite here so you might be
able<00:02:30.860> to<00:02:31.010> notice<00:02:31.370> now<00:02:31.730> there's<00:02:32.000> a<00:02:32.090> slight

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
able to notice now there's a slight

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.940 
able to notice now there's a slight
delay<00:02:32.750> for<00:02:33.680> window<00:02:33.890> opens<00:02:35.380> so<00:02:36.380> to<00:02:36.440> see<00:02:36.650> this<00:02:36.769> on

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
delay for window opens so to see this on

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.590 
delay for window opens so to see this on
a<00:02:36.980> larger<00:02:37.400> scale<00:02:38.230> so<00:02:39.230> this<00:02:39.500> is<00:02:39.530> a<00:02:39.680> delay<00:02:40.130> I've

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
a larger scale so this is a delay I've

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:48.449 
a larger scale so this is a delay I've
got<00:02:41.600> online<00:02:44.950> so<00:02:45.950> and<00:02:46.130> this<00:02:46.190> is<00:02:46.370> what<00:02:46.519> I've<00:02:46.640> done

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
got online so and this is what I've done

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.100 
got online so and this is what I've done
so<00:02:49.459> you<00:02:49.519> got<00:02:49.819> signal<00:02:50.360> coming<00:02:50.569> in<00:02:50.750> from<00:02:50.989> the

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
so you got signal coming in from the

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.360 
so you got signal coming in from the
door<00:02:51.319> down<00:02:51.830> there<00:02:53.019> the<00:02:54.019> other<00:02:54.200> door<00:02:54.470> is<00:02:54.799> over

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
door down there the other door is over

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.259 
door down there the other door is over
here<00:02:55.489> up<00:02:56.420> there<00:02:57.489> there's<00:02:58.489> my<00:02:58.700> order<00:02:59.000> for<00:02:59.180> my

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
here up there there's my order for my

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.270 
here up there there's my order for my
second<00:02:59.660> door<00:02:59.980> and<00:03:02.049> back<00:03:03.049> here<00:03:03.319> is<00:03:03.590> the<00:03:03.799> timing

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
second door and back here is the timing

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.090 
second door and back here is the timing
delay<00:03:04.880> circuit<00:03:08.019> so<00:03:09.019> I<00:03:09.049> think<00:03:09.410> I've<00:03:09.590> got<00:03:09.620> 12

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
delay circuit so I think I've got 12

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.789 
delay circuit so I think I've got 12
stages<00:03:10.340> all<00:03:10.730> up<00:03:13.750> and<00:03:14.750> it's<00:03:15.049> it's<00:03:15.500> a<00:03:15.590> bitch<00:03:15.769> to

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
stages all up and it's it's a bitch to

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:23.890 
stages all up and it's it's a bitch to
fit<00:03:19.120> but<00:03:20.290> that<00:03:21.290> is<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:21.650> curlies<00:03:22.459> of<00:03:22.840> how<00:03:23.840> to

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
fit but that is the curlies of how to

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.770
