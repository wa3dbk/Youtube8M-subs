00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.430
 ah 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.900
 there they know me as sophie and I am 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.369
 communicator and now I am manager 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:26.010
 cultural I'm producing museums of 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.010
 comedy but we live elderly later 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.020
 being the subject of a day 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.700
 and the music 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.079
 a lioness road doing 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.649
 and looked at him 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.649
 no no 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.170
 but in reality everyone has 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:01:00.030
 seen doing this 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.030
 to me 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.030
 but 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.899
 to know 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:19.190
 the only man who gets you up that day 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:22.300
 and if you're lucky Parente 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:25.730
 I started first getting myself a show of 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.740
 stand that produces that this was a 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.930
 stand championship then comedy like 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.430
 that to try new and out of curiosity and 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.140
 also to try some things that 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.820
 I wanted to say in public 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.180
 I made a monologue as well as super 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:41.270
 fast and I tried it in the championship of 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:43.670
 2011 and well it did not go well so I 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.040
 liked and I decided to start trying more 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.320
 monologues in different places then 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.090
 from that date I started to 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.070
 introduce myself as that in all places 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.070
 where I had a chance 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.920
 It is excellent to reconsider things 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.860
 to make you more tolerant more 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:04.400
 comprehensive 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.400
 reflect or be more 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.980
 the evil fighter 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.870
 sophie 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.870
 but next 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:32.109
 death this year's love death 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.469
 now to elaborate a monologue 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.659
 usually one like that starts to 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:40.790
 think about the things that happen to him 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:43.219
 daily they are usually very 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.349
 everyday or very simple but then it 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:48.799
 they turn around and especially have a 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:50.900
 look a look like that new one 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.620
 feeling of amazement in front of each thing 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.620
 what happens to you daily 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:12.900
 and I said I said it the first one that tells me 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:17.600
 caixanova 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:21.680
 and that's because I like it 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:24.290
 That girl grows or not but she says no 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.870
 it matters what interests I do not know who it is 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.160
 to call method I would have phone 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.490
 local shit 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.490
 she thinks 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.090
 if it has generated a very good very 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.600
 fast it's really like that up 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.910
 a few years ago there were almost comedians 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.210
 In Peru, it is not a genre that is 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:48.300
 entering and I would say compared to the 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.980
 last year now there's quite a lot they were not 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.430
 double or triple that of the 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.430
 last year 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:00.810
 He also went out with a bad man 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.980
 more elements guys that did not want me 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:07.450
 forget 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:09.640
 I used to call him the precious ones 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.720
 and he told me 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.720
 meego light 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.360
 iverson 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.620
 if that relationship did not end well 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:30.320
 it's really fine super intimacy 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.479
 can look at that time the only thing that 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.300
 I could console myself was watching videos of 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:37.870
 There are 200 models 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.740
 while I said good and company 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.660
 precisely 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.810
 and that you're a chicken leg to the 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.810
 embers 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.979
 I lived self-destructively 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:55.449
 look bossy to overcome until the 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:55.449
 little boxes were more 

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:03.599
 but the truth 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:08.629
 is independent and is usually expected 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.210
 Do the only thing they do to you 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.940
 work 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.840
 and you need to get richer and 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.840
 more than ever 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:34.349
 see all 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.580
 but curiously when you 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.139
 you find if you lend in the cellar 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.570
 flip flops 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:48.410
 using an electoral campaign pole to 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.410
 torturing crimes 

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:52.849
 these next I prefer open mics 

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:55.549
 what are presentations is a comedy 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:57.019
 of comedy monologues in which you are invited 

00:05:55.549 --> 00:05:58.429
 to a general public let's say to 

00:05:57.019 --> 00:06:00.829
 anyone who wants to participate 

00:05:58.429 --> 00:06:02.299
 try comedy monologues in front of a 

00:06:00.829 --> 00:06:03.679
 audience in public and finally they go 

00:06:02.299 --> 00:06:06.049
 guys who already have some experience 

00:06:03.679 --> 00:06:08.659
 not doing monologues or it takes you to some 

00:06:06.049 --> 00:06:09.589
 workshop or out there comedians 

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:14.469
 professionals who want to try 

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:14.469
 monologues new moments 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:19.930
 true friends incomparable furnishings 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:27.160
 such they will be part 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.910
 yes 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.900
 one 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:52.200
 and what you are really looking for is 

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:53.910
 is to create public scrolling imports 

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.650
 a lot of money when it is generated but 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:58.110
 rather create public to then be able 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.820
 make presentations and it becomes 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:02.040
 not popular and that people go to see it 

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:03.389
 in relation the idea right now what 

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.919
 we have made a first 

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:06.720
 season that is called the kings of the 

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:09.180
 laughter could not come where we have 

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:11.310
 had in November we finished in 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:13.230
 December and now we are going to start a 

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:15.450
 new season in February March of the day 

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:16.669
 they are also with nights of lodging because 

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:19.710
 when what I'm doing for now 

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:21.930
 work want to try to see this this 

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:23.340

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.780

 so some free tickets are missing 

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.260

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:32.970

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.980

 both women and more emotional more 

00:07:49.779 --> 00:07:55.629
 romantic we need the excitement about 

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:59.219
 a conflict something that must be overcome 

00:07:55.629 --> 00:07:59.219
 because if you do not get shot
