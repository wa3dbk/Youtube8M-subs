so<00:02:22.630> that<00:02:22.810> it's<00:02:22.930> dry<00:02:23.140> when<00:02:23.410> I<00:02:23.440> go<00:02:23.590> to<00:02:23.650> work<00:02:23.770> with

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
so that it's dry when I go to work with

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.570 
so that it's dry when I go to work with
that<00:02:24.130> so<00:02:25.740> I'm<00:02:26.740> just<00:02:26.860> like<00:02:26.980> to<00:02:27.160> see<00:02:27.310> that<00:02:27.460> it's

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
that so I'm just like to see that it's

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.940 
that so I'm just like to see that it's
dry<00:02:27.790> up<00:02:27.940> here<00:02:27.970> yesterday<00:02:28.750> I<00:02:28.990> rake<00:02:29.740> all<00:02:29.920> the

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
dry up here yesterday I rake all the

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.120 
dry up here yesterday I rake all the
leaves<00:02:30.070> out<00:02:30.610> so<00:02:31.480> that<00:02:31.630> there<00:02:31.780> wouldn't<00:02:31.930> be

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
leaves out so that there wouldn't be

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.680 
leaves out so that there wouldn't be
clumps<00:02:33.130> of<00:02:33.250> wet<00:02:33.460> and<00:02:34.060> it's<00:02:34.180> been<00:02:34.300> sunny<00:02:34.510> all

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
clumps of wet and it's been sunny all

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.470 
clumps of wet and it's been sunny all
day<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:35.050> so<00:02:35.170> now<00:02:35.350> my<00:02:36.040> plywood<00:02:36.280> is<00:02:36.520> dry<00:02:36.820> that's

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
day and so now my plywood is dry that's

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.650 
day and so now my plywood is dry that's
so<00:02:37.750> nice<00:02:37.990> and<00:02:38.620> I've<00:02:38.860> got<00:02:39.040> four<00:02:39.400> days<00:02:39.610> of<00:02:40.210> Sun

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
so nice and I've got four days of Sun

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.360 
so nice and I've got four days of Sun
hopefully<00:02:41.290> and<00:02:41.770> so<00:02:42.400> I'm<00:02:43.360> gonna<00:02:43.450> see<00:02:44.070> how<00:02:45.070> far<00:02:45.310> I

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
hopefully and so I'm gonna see how far I

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.140 
hopefully and so I'm gonna see how far I
can<00:02:45.490> get<00:02:46.320> first<00:02:47.320> step<00:02:47.590> is<00:02:48.100> the<00:02:48.370> beams<00:02:48.580> that<00:02:48.880> go

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
can get first step is the beams that go

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.450 
can get first step is the beams that go
in<00:02:49.330> there<00:02:49.540> and<00:02:49.750> go<00:02:50.380> up<00:02:50.530> on<00:02:50.680> my<00:02:50.770> notches<00:02:51.250> and

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
in there and go up on my notches and

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.420 
in there and go up on my notches and
then<00:02:52.270> go<00:02:52.480> across<00:02:52.800> those<00:02:53.800> are<00:02:53.980> gonna<00:02:54.070> hold<00:02:54.250> all

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
then go across those are gonna hold all

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.740 
then go across those are gonna hold all
the<00:02:54.520> roof<00:02:54.670> rafters<00:02:55.120> they're<00:02:55.330> also<00:02:55.480> gonna

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
the roof rafters they're also gonna

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.950 
the roof rafters they're also gonna
double<00:02:56.110> to<00:02:56.560> hold<00:02:56.800> this<00:02:57.070> floor<00:02:57.760> up<00:02:58.210> above<00:02:58.750> me

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
double to hold this floor up above me

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.900 
double to hold this floor up above me
here<00:02:59.260> so<00:03:00.100> there'll<00:03:00.280> be<00:03:00.310> a<00:03:00.400> floor<00:03:00.700> at<00:03:00.850> that

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
here so there'll be a floor at that

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.000 
here so there'll be a floor at that
height<00:03:01.590> in<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.800> little<00:03:03.010> cupola<00:03:03.340> area<00:03:03.810> so<00:03:05.010> I'm

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
height in the little cupola area so I'm

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.010 
height in the little cupola area so I'm
gonna<00:03:06.130> build<00:03:06.310> my<00:03:06.460> beams<00:03:06.700> and<00:03:07.030> then<00:03:07.840> I<00:03:07.870> don't

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
gonna build my beams and then I don't

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.450 
gonna build my beams and then I don't
think<00:03:08.140> I'm<00:03:08.230> gonna<00:03:08.380> build<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:08.710> end<00:03:08.890> wall<00:03:09.280> and

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
think I'm gonna build the end wall and

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:10.620 
think I'm gonna build the end wall and
actually<00:03:09.730> no<00:03:09.820> I'm<00:03:09.940> gonna<00:03:10.060> build<00:03:10.270> the<00:03:10.360> beams

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
actually no I'm gonna build the beams

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:17.120 
actually no I'm gonna build the beams
build<00:03:11.380> the<00:03:11.470> floor<00:03:13.680> build<00:03:14.680> my<00:03:14.830> end<00:03:15.040> walls<00:03:15.430> and

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
build the floor build my end walls and

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.120 
build the floor build my end walls and
then<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:19.150> end<00:03:19.330> walls<00:03:19.660> are<00:03:19.840> gonna<00:03:19.959> support<00:03:20.440> the

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
then the end walls are gonna support the

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.480 
then the end walls are gonna support the
supports<00:03:22.290> for<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.380> upper<00:03:23.770> beams<00:03:23.980> and<00:03:24.370> then

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
supports for the upper beams and then

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.370 
supports for the upper beams and then
I'm<00:03:24.610> gonna<00:03:24.730> put<00:03:25.030> in<00:03:25.240> the<00:03:25.510> upper<00:03:25.810> beams<00:03:26.020> and

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
I'm gonna put in the upper beams and

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.520 
I'm gonna put in the upper beams and
that's<00:03:27.010> when<00:03:27.400> I<00:03:27.640> can<00:03:27.790> complete<00:03:28.750> my<00:03:28.780> sandwich

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
that's when I can complete my sandwich

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.830 
that's when I can complete my sandwich
with<00:03:30.160> plywood<00:03:30.430> because<00:03:30.820> the<00:03:31.330> plywood<00:03:31.720> is

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
with plywood because the plywood is

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.480 
with plywood because the plywood is
going<00:03:31.959> to<00:03:32.020> extend<00:03:32.200> from<00:03:32.620> this<00:03:32.770> lower<00:03:32.950> beam<00:03:33.220> up

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 
going to extend from this lower beam up

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.790 
going to extend from this lower beam up
to<00:03:34.060> the<00:03:34.180> upper<00:03:34.450> beam<00:03:34.630> and<00:03:34.870> provide<00:03:35.500> lateral

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
to the upper beam and provide lateral

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.270 
to the upper beam and provide lateral
strength<00:03:36.280> the<00:03:36.430> entire<00:03:36.760> length<00:03:37.090> of<00:03:37.270> the<00:03:37.360> garage

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
strength the entire length of the garage

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.390 
strength the entire length of the garage
so<00:03:40.020> that's<00:03:41.020> when<00:03:41.260> I<00:03:41.290> can<00:03:41.410> put<00:03:41.650> my<00:03:41.800> plywood<00:03:42.250> in

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
so that's when I can put my plywood in

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.850 
so that's when I can put my plywood in
I've<00:03:42.880> got<00:03:42.910> to<00:03:43.270> figure<00:03:43.480> out<00:03:43.630> at<00:03:43.750> this<00:03:43.810> point<00:03:44.230> how

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
I've got to figure out at this point how

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.080 
I've got to figure out at this point how
the<00:03:44.920> hell<00:03:45.100> I'm<00:03:45.220> gonna<00:03:45.340> build<00:03:45.489> these<00:03:45.640> bottom

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
the hell I'm gonna build these bottom

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.960 
the hell I'm gonna build these bottom
beams<00:03:46.330> temporarily<00:03:48.120> and<00:03:49.120> with<00:03:49.870> a<00:03:49.900> gap<00:03:50.230> and<00:03:50.970> get

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
beams temporarily and with a gap and get

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.890 
beams temporarily and with a gap and get
that<00:03:52.090> to<00:03:52.270> work<00:03:52.480> so<00:03:53.350> I<00:03:53.620> may<00:03:53.890> put<00:03:54.190> small<00:03:54.900> like

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
that to work so I may put small like

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.949 
that to work so I may put small like
filler<00:03:56.350> pieces<00:03:57.160> of<00:03:57.280> plywood<00:03:57.459> in<00:03:57.850> where<00:03:58.840> the

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
filler pieces of plywood in where the

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.479 
filler pieces of plywood in where the
sandwich<00:03:59.230> will<00:03:59.470> go<00:03:59.620> and<00:03:59.920> then<00:04:00.040> take<00:04:00.250> them<00:04:00.400> out

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
sandwich will go and then take them out

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.970 
sandwich will go and then take them out
later<00:04:00.730> so<00:04:01.440> anyway<00:04:02.440> that's<00:04:02.590> all<00:04:02.770> you<00:04:02.830> gotta

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
later so anyway that's all you gotta

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.060 
later so anyway that's all you gotta
figure<00:04:03.130> out<00:04:03.250> so<00:04:03.640> I<00:04:03.910> can't<00:04:04.330> do<00:04:04.420> it<00:04:04.540> by<00:04:04.660> talking

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
figure out so I can't do it by talking

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:15.040 
figure out so I can't do it by talking
go<00:04:06.070> by

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.110 

you
