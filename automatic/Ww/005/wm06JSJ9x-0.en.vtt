00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.910 

steering's<00:01:21.840> extremely<00:01:22.410> light<00:01:22.650> really

the<00:01:28.110> clutch<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.560> little<00:01:28.890> bit<00:01:28.979> strange

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
the clutch is a little bit strange

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.930 
the clutch is a little bit strange
because<00:01:29.550> the<00:01:30.270> clutch<00:01:30.479> pedal<00:01:30.630> itself<00:01:31.050> is<00:01:31.940> it's

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
because the clutch pedal itself is it's

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.180 
because the clutch pedal itself is it's
I<00:01:33.240> don't<00:01:33.300> want<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.540> say<00:01:33.630> like<00:01:33.660> it's<00:01:33.930> spongy<00:01:34.320> but

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
I don't want to say like it's spongy but

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.170 
I don't want to say like it's spongy but
it<00:01:35.399> kind<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.970> reminds<00:01:36.750> me<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:37.740> Honda<00:01:38.610> pedal

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
it kind of reminds me of a Honda pedal

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.859 
it kind of reminds me of a Honda pedal
or<00:01:39.479> like<00:01:39.899> a<00:01:39.930> something<00:01:40.740> from<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.950> GTI<00:01:41.280> or

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
or like a something from a GTI or

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.090 
or like a something from a GTI or
something<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.050> effect<00:01:43.350> but<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.860> grab

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
something to that effect but the grab

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.109 
something to that effect but the grab
point<00:01:44.550> is<00:01:45.289> it's<00:01:46.289> really<00:01:46.560> sensitive<00:01:46.880> even<00:01:47.880> from

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
point is it's really sensitive even from

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.840 
point is it's really sensitive even from
inside<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.630> car<00:01:49.100> there's<00:01:50.100> nothing<00:01:50.430> like<00:01:50.550> a<00:01:50.610> v8

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
inside the car there's nothing like a v8

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.130 
inside the car there's nothing like a v8
I'll<00:01:51.149> say<00:01:51.330> once<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.720> I'll<00:01:51.780> say<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:51.990> again

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
I'll say once and I'll say it again

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.230 
I'll say once and I'll say it again
there's<00:01:52.530> no<00:01:52.860> replacement<00:01:53.580> for<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.940> sound<00:01:54.149> of

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
there's no replacement for the sound of

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.990 
there's no replacement for the sound of
a<00:01:54.330> v8<00:01:54.630> with<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.350> nice<00:01:55.560> exhaust<00:01:55.860> on<00:01:56.160> it

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.060 

see<00:02:01.960> there's<00:02:02.140> a<00:02:02.260> thing<00:02:02.470> there's<00:02:02.710> torque

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
see there's a thing there's torque

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.970 
see there's a thing there's torque
everywhere<00:02:03.820> like<00:02:04.540> having<00:02:04.780> 1500<00:02:05.380> rpm<00:02:05.740> no

problem it would it's going to take me a

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.590 
problem it would it's going to take me a
long<00:02:08.950> time<00:02:08.979> to<00:02:09.190> get<00:02:09.369> used<00:02:09.550> to<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:09.759> size<00:02:10.270> the

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
long time to get used to the size the

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
of the car it still feels like you're

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.210 
of the car it still feels like you're
hunkered<00:04:17.700> down<00:04:17.750> kind<00:04:18.750> of<00:04:18.900> more<00:04:19.320> at<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:19.829> height

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
hunkered down kind of more at the height

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
of the engine and chassis rather than

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.250 
of the engine and chassis rather than
placed<00:04:23.400> on<00:04:23.580> top<00:04:23.760> of<00:04:24.000> it<00:04:24.120> I<00:04:24.300> think<00:04:25.050> the<00:04:25.200> only

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
placed on top of it I think the only

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.720 
placed on top of it I think the only
thing<00:04:25.530> that<00:04:25.830> would<00:04:25.919> make<00:04:25.950> this<00:04:26.190> car<00:04:26.400> sound

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
thing that would make this car sound

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.400 
thing that would make this car sound
better<00:04:26.970> is<00:04:27.270> a<00:04:27.840> blower<00:04:28.770> whine<00:04:29.100> the<00:04:30.140> one<00:04:31.140> thing

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
better is a blower whine the one thing

better is a blower whine the one thing

they<00:04:50.010> know<00:04:50.100> how<00:04:50.220> to<00:04:50.250> make<00:04:50.460> good<00:04:51.050> powerful<00:04:52.050> v8

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
they know how to make good powerful v8

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.940 
they know how to make good powerful v8
and<00:04:53.000> efficient<00:04:54.000> v8<00:04:54.330> as<00:04:54.570> well<00:04:54.780> which<00:04:55.680> are<00:04:55.830> two

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
and efficient v8 as well which are two

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.980 
and efficient v8 as well which are two
things<00:04:56.190> that<00:04:56.400> do<00:04:56.520> not

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
things that do not

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.470 
things that do not
power<00:04:58.800> and<00:04:59.250> efficiency<00:04:59.580> do<00:04:59.820> not<00:04:59.970> go<00:05:00.210> well

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480 
power and efficiency do not go well

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.000 
power and efficiency do not go well
together<00:05:00.720> especially<00:05:01.050> if<00:05:01.500> we're<00:05:01.680> talking

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
together especially if we're talking

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.550 
together especially if we're talking
about<00:05:02.100> Lamborghinis<00:05:02.880> Ferraris<00:05:02.930> I<00:05:03.930> mean<00:05:04.440> those

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
about Lamborghinis Ferraris I mean those

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.620 
about Lamborghinis Ferraris I mean those
things<00:05:04.710> heat<00:05:05.040> up<00:05:05.070> gas<00:05:05.460> like<00:05:05.820> no<00:05:05.970> tomorrow<00:05:06.390> any

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
things heat up gas like no tomorrow any

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.690

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
big VAB 10 v12 the one thing well I mean

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.340 
big VAB 10 v12 the one thing well I mean
me<00:05:11.910> being<00:05:11.940> a<00:05:12.300> small<00:05:12.540> car<00:05:12.810> guy<00:05:12.960> it's<00:05:13.170> not<00:05:13.320> a

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
me being a small car guy it's not a

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.140 
me being a small car guy it's not a
knock<00:05:13.590> against<00:05:13.920> the<00:05:14.070> car<00:05:14.280> but<00:05:14.640> just<00:05:14.670> the<00:05:14.910> size

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
knock against the car but just the size

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.270 
knock against the car but just the size
of<00:05:15.240> the<00:05:15.300> car<00:05:15.540> I'm<00:05:15.690> not<00:05:15.720> one<00:05:15.990> for<00:05:16.140> big<00:05:16.290> cars<00:05:16.530> but

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
of the car I'm not one for big cars but

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.920 
of the car I'm not one for big cars but
it's<00:05:17.460> definitely<00:05:17.850> a<00:05:17.880> unique<00:05:18.120> experience<00:05:18.300> and

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
it's definitely a unique experience and

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.540 
it's definitely a unique experience and
I<00:05:18.990> love<00:05:19.170> driving<00:05:19.440> the<00:05:19.650> thing<00:05:19.680> we're<00:05:20.370> not<00:05:20.490> on

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
I love driving the thing we're not on

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:21.980 
I love driving the thing we're not on
the<00:05:20.610> best<00:05:20.850> roads<00:05:21.120> for<00:05:21.330> this<00:05:21.450> so<00:05:21.540> I'm<00:05:21.660> really

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
the best roads for this so I'm really

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.660 
the best roads for this so I'm really
been<00:05:22.200> able<00:05:22.320> to<00:05:22.470> Huck<00:05:22.650> it<00:05:22.800> around<00:05:23.070> as<00:05:23.280> much<00:05:23.400> as<00:05:23.580> I

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:23.670 
been able to Huck it around as much as I

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.580 
been able to Huck it around as much as I
would<00:05:23.760> like<00:05:24.000> to<00:05:24.270> but<00:05:25.080> from<00:05:25.260> what<00:05:25.440> I<00:05:25.470> can

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
would like to but from what I can

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.220 
would like to but from what I can
experience<00:05:26.040> the<00:05:26.280> body<00:05:26.430> roll<00:05:26.790> isn't

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.230 
experience the body roll isn't

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.000 
experience the body roll isn't
unmanageable<00:05:28.230> by<00:05:28.380> any<00:05:28.560> stretch<00:05:28.770> of<00:05:28.860> the

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
unmanageable by any stretch of the

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:35.040 
unmanageable by any stretch of the
imagination

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.700 

yeah<00:05:35.949> the<00:05:36.099> really<00:05:36.400> low<00:05:36.729> down<00:05:36.759> torque<00:05:37.240> is<00:05:37.360> nice

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
yeah the really low down torque is nice

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.499 
yeah the really low down torque is nice
you<00:05:38.710> get<00:05:38.860> that<00:05:39.099> with<00:05:39.310> you<00:05:40.150> get<00:05:40.270> that<00:05:40.300> with

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:40.509 
you get that with you get that with

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:43.619 
you get that with you get that with
turbocharged<00:05:41.050> cars<00:05:41.319> but<00:05:42.150> it's<00:05:43.150> only<00:05:43.389> to<00:05:43.599> a

00:05:43.619 --> 00:05:43.629 
turbocharged cars but it's only to a

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:46.559 
turbocharged cars but it's only to a
certain<00:05:43.960> extent<00:05:44.440> and<00:05:44.849> the<00:05:45.849> torque<00:05:46.180> is<00:05:46.330> not

00:05:46.559 --> 00:05:46.569 
certain extent and the torque is not

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:49.140 
certain extent and the torque is not
instant<00:05:47.139> there's<00:05:47.590> just<00:05:48.009> no<00:05:48.190> comparison<00:05:48.400> over

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
instant there's just no comparison over

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.939 
instant there's just no comparison over
a<00:05:49.180> turbocharged<00:05:49.840> engine<00:05:50.139> versus<00:05:50.470> a<00:05:50.530> naturally

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:50.949 
a turbocharged engine versus a naturally

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:53.219 
a turbocharged engine versus a naturally
aspirated<00:05:51.220> engine<00:05:51.699> it's<00:05:52.210> the<00:05:52.870> throttle

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:53.229 
aspirated engine it's the throttle

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:54.600 
aspirated engine it's the throttle
response<00:05:53.289> is<00:05:53.650> going<00:05:53.830> to<00:05:53.889> be<00:05:54.009> a<00:05:54.250> lot<00:05:54.580> more

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
response is going to be a lot more

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.659 
response is going to be a lot more
instant<00:05:55.180> and<00:05:55.800> especially<00:05:56.800> with<00:05:57.069> a<00:05:57.099> v8<00:05:57.370> like

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:57.669 
instant and especially with a v8 like

00:05:57.669 --> 00:05:59.970 
instant and especially with a v8 like
there's<00:05:57.849> a<00:05:57.909> really<00:05:58.330> big<00:05:58.509> v8

00:05:59.970 --> 00:05:59.980 
there's a really big v8

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.670 
there's a really big v8
you're<00:06:00.190> getting<00:06:00.430> it<00:06:00.490> working<00:06:00.820> right<00:06:01.000> away<00:06:01.680> and

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
you're getting it working right away and

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.560 
you're getting it working right away and
you<00:06:02.830> won't<00:06:03.100> have<00:06:03.370> to<00:06:03.520> ever<00:06:03.670> rev<00:06:04.060> it<00:06:04.210> out<00:06:04.330> if<00:06:04.480> you

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.570 
you won't have to ever rev it out if you

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.149 
you won't have to ever rev it out if you
don't<00:06:04.690> want<00:06:04.930> to

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:06.159 
don't want to

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:08.890 
don't want to
one<00:06:07.159> thing<00:06:07.400> that<00:06:07.430> I've<00:06:08.090> always<00:06:08.389> liked<00:06:08.689> about

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:08.900 
one thing that I've always liked about

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.779 
one thing that I've always liked about
this<00:06:09.050> car<00:06:09.259> though<00:06:09.439> is<00:06:09.680> the<00:06:09.919> styling<00:06:10.400> they<00:06:10.610> have

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:10.789 
this car though is the styling they have

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:11.950 
this car though is the styling they have
changed<00:06:10.970> a<00:06:11.150> little<00:06:11.330> bit<00:06:11.539> for<00:06:11.750> the<00:06:11.810> new

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
changed a little bit for the new

always have to check for a Hellcat badge
always<00:06:36.530> got<00:06:36.680> it
