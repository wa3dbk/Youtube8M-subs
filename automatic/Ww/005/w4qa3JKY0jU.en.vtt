00:00:02.989 --> 00:00:08.790
 so that's my water a run and 

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:11.670
 That's how I did it on this one 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.230
 the sheet metal I have this bracket 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:18.359
 you can do that in another video 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:21.119
 here you can see the bracket and here 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:25.230
 should therefore the water from above over it 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.699
 flow and then into the basin purely that 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.720
 of course, I have to cut the sheet metal 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.919
 I also somehow I know too 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.400
 not yet cut anywhere here 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:38.880
 and then I have to do that again 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:41.640
 bend or I 'll only 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.850
 against and then I have to cut times 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.810
 watching how I do that or I leave 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.660
 it as long as I do not know yet 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.580
 definitely look here 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.160
 I offer after a little 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.150
 down that one with the hammer that still 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.740
 a bit down and then I have 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:05.309
 Here's a good pad so now I have 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:06.810
 The tin was grown and I had it 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.640
 ever mentioned that I always 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.299
 to set any difficulties 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.299
 would 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:17.399
 if you are right there then you realize 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.159
 only because that works or put that 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:26.340
 works like that and now I go 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:29.810
 there but the problem that that 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.700
 Water runs sideways away 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.539
 if that goes underneath it that way 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:41.429
 I've already done two here 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:45.149
 first made to look like 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:47.600
 but that could still be done 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.450
 not high enough and 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.000
 has not considered before 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.080
 that it's from the noise level to the water 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.560
 from there in this basin pure ripples 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:06.009
 but is relatively loud and try now 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:08.060
 I do that with a few modifications 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.180
 somehow to get hold of that 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.840
 it is not too loud but still 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:16.600
 fulfilled its purpose and what I then 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.860
 exactly before 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:25.940
 I will show that later, so now I have to 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:29.300
 purely technical tasks solve that 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:33.760
 problem is now so far 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.239
 loud everything was alright I have upstairs 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.730
 sealed 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:42.319
 then the connection was under the bucket 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:45.260
 was leaking 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:48.290
 I've shut it up just now 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.040
 Acrylic on the but with acrylic den 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:55.480
 Connecting a device or 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:59.269
 sealed so have the foil down here 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:04.670
 guided and then my idea was that he 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:08.109
 so the incoming here, of course, want 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:11.010
 I also like a few problems 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:13.980
 tasks 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:18.310
 present that is my problem now 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:21.400
 the first problem is simply that 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.560
 water overflows over here 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.000
 edge that means I have to go higher here 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.770
 knew to take 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.170
 originally I did not want to take any 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:35.530
 but it's just not possible to change 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.200
 the noise level or is quite loud 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.330
 if the water from above 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:44.200
 Reinfeld because you have to see if you are 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:47.260
 I can arrange the solution 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:52.150
 now just have prepared here 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:56.020
 only as a provisionary I also like 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:04:00.000
 not because the water is filling up behind 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:06.010
 the wall does not splash and the wood does not 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:10.530
 So here I have to necessarily one 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:12.700
 technical solution we come up with and 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.340
 I already had ideas but I have to 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.070
 see how it can do it 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:21.220
 yes and sometime in the video he will be 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.940
 See what she has a solution for me 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.940
 to come up with
