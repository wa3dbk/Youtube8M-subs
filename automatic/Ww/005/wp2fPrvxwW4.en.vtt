00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.960 
and enable it and running all directions
I<00:01:43.920> don't<00:01:44.070> really<00:01:44.159> know<00:01:44.310> what<00:01:44.430> this<00:01:44.549> is<00:01:44.759> the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
I don't really know what this is the

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.410 
I don't really know what this is the
whole<00:01:45.119> running<00:01:45.360> all<00:01:45.540> directions<00:01:45.930> so<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:47.420> just

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
whole running all directions so I just

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.880 
whole running all directions so I just
leave<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:48.869> default<00:01:49.350> but<00:01:49.530> pretty<00:01:49.799> much

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
leave that I default but pretty much

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.429 
leave that I default but pretty much
it's<00:01:49.979> really<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.850> really<00:01:51.240> cool<00:01:51.420> mod<00:01:51.600> really

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
it's really a really cool mod really

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.050 
it's really a really cool mod really
simple<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.040> got<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.280> like<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.399> new<00:01:53.610> world<00:01:53.850> here

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
simple so I got to like a new world here

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.399 
simple so I got to like a new world here
I'm<00:01:54.570> just<00:01:54.720> going<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:54.930> show<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.110> how<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.380> works

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
I'm just going to show you how it works

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.560 
I'm just going to show you how it works
so<00:01:55.649> if<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.799> click<00:01:55.860> capital<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.579> got<00:01:57.090> caps<00:01:57.299> lock<00:01:57.450> on

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
so if I click capital I got caps lock on

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.929 
so if I click capital I got caps lock on
right<00:01:57.780> now<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.189> you<00:01:59.189> will<00:01:59.310> hear<00:01:59.520> i'm<00:01:59.729> going<00:01:59.880> to

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
right now and you will hear i'm going to

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.380 
right now and you will hear i'm going to
press<00:02:00.090> my<00:02:00.240> w<00:02:00.659> bottom<00:02:00.869> once<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.409> ready<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:02.390> only

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
press my w bottom once you ready I only

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.080 
press my w bottom once you ready I only
clicked<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.750> once<00:02:04.640> this<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.729> me<00:02:05.820> clean<00:02:06.060> it

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
clicked it once this is me clean it

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.559 
clicked it once this is me clean it
twice<00:02:06.740> isn't<00:02:07.740> because<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.129> was<00:02:08.280> so<00:02:09.209> all<00:02:09.420> the

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
twice isn't because it was so all the

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.510 
twice isn't because it was so all the
time<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:09.929> sprint<00:02:10.289> so<00:02:10.950> if<00:02:11.069> i<00:02:11.129> press<00:02:11.280> cover

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
time you sprint so if i press cover

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.640 
time you sprint so if i press cover
again<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.090> if<00:02:12.540> i<00:02:12.629> hold<00:02:12.810> shift

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
again and if i hold shift

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.830 
again and if i hold shift
it<00:02:14.430> just<00:02:14.640> does<00:02:14.819> a<00:02:14.849> regular<00:02:15.239> one<00:02:15.390> but<00:02:15.569> obviously

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
it just does a regular one but obviously

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.800 
it just does a regular one but obviously
you<00:02:15.959> can<00:02:16.079> change<00:02:16.319> that<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.739> be<00:02:17.689> you<00:02:18.689> know

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
you can change that to be you know

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.330 
you can change that to be you know
whatever<00:02:19.140> you<00:02:19.230> want<00:02:19.409> it<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.530> be<00:02:19.769> maybe<00:02:20.250> you

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340

more<00:02:25.290> double<00:02:25.560> tap<00:02:25.819> I'm<00:02:26.819> double<00:02:27.090> tapping

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
more double tap I'm double tapping

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:28.550

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
there's no more double tap w because I

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.610 
there's no more double tap w because I
have<00:02:28.709> it<00:02:28.799> disabled<00:02:29.220> so<00:02:29.610> just<00:02:29.790> tap<00:02:30.450> control<00:02:31.140> and

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
have it disabled so just tap control and

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.440 
have it disabled so just tap control and
it<00:02:31.980> automatically<00:02:32.519> allows<00:02:32.819> me<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.150> sprint

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
it automatically allows me to sprint

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.729 
it automatically allows me to sprint
whether<00:02:33.659> you<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:34.170> one<00:02:34.290> thing<00:02:34.409> I<00:02:34.500> didn't<00:02:34.709> like

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
whether you the one thing I didn't like

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.830 
whether you the one thing I didn't like
is<00:02:35.010> like<00:02:35.099> you'd<00:02:35.310> hit<00:02:35.489> like<00:02:35.730> a<00:02:35.760> block<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.689> it

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
is like you'd hit like a block and it

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.210 
is like you'd hit like a block and it
stopped<00:02:37.200> you<00:02:37.290> sprint<00:02:37.560> enough<00:02:37.769> a<00:02:37.829> double<00:02:38.069> tap

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
stopped you sprint enough a double tap

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.559 
stopped you sprint enough a double tap
again<00:02:38.340> and<00:02:38.640> sometimes<00:02:38.939> it<00:02:39.060> would<00:02:39.120> work<00:02:39.299> first

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
again and sometimes it would work first

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:40.670 
again and sometimes it would work first
time<00:02:39.780> when<00:02:39.900> you're<00:02:39.989> running<00:02:40.109> from<00:02:40.230> a<00:02:40.349> zombie

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
time when you're running from a zombie

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.380 
time when you're running from a zombie
or<00:02:40.859> especially<00:02:41.670> when<00:02:41.760> you're<00:02:41.849> in<00:02:41.939> from<00:02:42.120> spider

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
or especially when you're in from spider

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.030 
or especially when you're in from spider
because<00:02:42.569> the<00:02:42.720> fastest<00:02:43.109> hell<00:02:43.260> so<00:02:43.769> as<00:02:43.859> you<00:02:43.890> can

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
because the fastest hell so as you can

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.000 
because the fastest hell so as you can
see<00:02:44.189> you<00:02:44.220> can<00:02:44.370> sprint<00:02:44.819> constantly<00:02:45.359> now<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:46.010> it

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
see you can sprint constantly now and it

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.740 
see you can sprint constantly now and it
makes<00:02:47.280> me<00:02:47.370> happy<00:02:47.790> on<00:02:47.909> the<00:02:48.000> inside<00:02:48.030> which<00:02:48.540> is

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
makes me happy on the inside which is

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.360 
makes me happy on the inside which is
really<00:02:48.989> cool<00:02:49.230> so<00:02:49.889> I<00:02:49.920> think<00:02:50.040> there's<00:02:50.250> like<00:02:50.280> a

really cool so I think there's like a
sprint<00:02:50.730> in<00:02:50.879> all<00:02:51.030> directions<00:02:51.150> it's<00:02:51.659> like<00:02:51.750> you

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870
