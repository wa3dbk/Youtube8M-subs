00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 the last time a look at the 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.299
 thrown back area of â€‹â€‹the bridge and 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.639
 Now let's take a look at how 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.639
 it turned out farther from her tax house 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.670
 Hello 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.670
 from here are always the announce 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.670
 made to the passengers 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:39.540
 and there we have the famous piece of 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.170
 captain personally now do not have from 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.360
 the bridge 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.440
 the ship controls itself by 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.750
 autopilot 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.040
 but of course there are still people here 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.560
 to watch out 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:53.140
 for example, officer or date 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.480
 They look out, for example 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.680
 whether fischer red cross or about 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.410
 container in the water 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.550
 So you're not just joachim 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.360
 POSS 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.360
 are planned 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.320
 the totally messed up but it 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.060
 it already has a system that works 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.610
 the frequency as well as the ship 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.410
 harbor is approaching this little room 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.580
 safety room there you can see how 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:21.080
 smoke in the cabin and also like 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.980
 fire doors card on whole package 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:28.010
 25 years old and so as the bridge 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:31.070
 so with dial that still exists 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:34.070
 but should be built there but keeps 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:40.570
 crank that is when we the 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:40.570
 curve blackout even himself 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.130
 shelves these sounds 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.300
 the hand
