00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.140
 someone by mistake formatting a unit 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.320
 of disk so I lost all the 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.990
 reactive stored information is a 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.480
 application that allows you to recover the 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.220
 information from a formatted disk is 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.270
 download the page that is in the 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.270
 description of the video 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.940
 Once the download is finished, we go to the 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.050
 container folder and we proceed to 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.600
 install it 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.840
 we select the installation language 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.150
 we let us continue 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.030
 click on finish to launch the 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.239
 application I leave selected the first 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:58.180
 option that is to search all files 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:01.630
 from there I will select a position 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:05.560
 specific that in my case is the unit and 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:08.470
 I'm going to make a pass as it comes out 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.890
 the assistant without selecting scan 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.890
 deep 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.580
 the result is that you only find 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:21.010
 these two files that do not mean 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.070
 a lot now I'm going to perform a scan 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.909
 deep about the steps selected 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:31.409
 the unit pulse in next 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:34.049
 and start the scan let the 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.819
 relevant time for the process then 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.299
 that the steps have been carried out 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:42.060
 for the file search the unit x 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.979
 mateada will appear a list with the 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.109
 files that are going to be marked with a 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.189
 color according to the quality and that 

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:52.349
 find those that are unrecoverable 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:55.049
 are marked with a red color when 

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:58.300
 do scan I should select recover 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:01.190
 folder structure 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.680
 now I'm going to see the tree view 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.380
 what will allow me to select more 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.900
 easily the files that urges me 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.400
 recover here I will give an example 

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.400
 with some photographs 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.450
 this version of the free program is going to 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.020
 allow to recover up to a certain number 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.570
 of branches in the file tree not 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.900
 I can recover the products of a single 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.780
 knock 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.540
 here I am selecting the route to where 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.160
 I will send the recovered files 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:36.140
 here we see that I recover them 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:40.000
 I'm going to navigate to the location 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:44.050
 of these recovered photos 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.590
 remember that I must first recover the 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.540
 files that are priority for me 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.260
 below an image of how 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:58.020
