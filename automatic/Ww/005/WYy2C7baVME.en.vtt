to<00:00:18.490> kite<00:00:18.760> so<00:00:19.630> let's<00:00:19.779> start<00:00:19.960> with<00:00:20.080> the

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:20.259 
to kite so let's start with the

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:22.410 
to kite so let's start with the
fundamentals<00:00:21.040> we're<00:00:21.700> going<00:00:21.820> to<00:00:21.939> start<00:00:22.090> by

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.420 
fundamentals we're going to start by

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.400 
fundamentals we're going to start by
covering<00:00:23.250> using<00:00:24.250> frost<00:00:24.580> no<00:00:25.200> I'm<00:00:26.200> gonna<00:00:26.349> go

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
covering using frost no I'm gonna go

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.780 
covering using frost no I'm gonna go
ahead<00:00:26.500> and<00:00:26.590> pull<00:00:26.829> him<00:00:26.950> back<00:00:27.130> with<00:00:27.369> Fire<00:00:27.610> Blast

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:27.790 
ahead and pull him back with Fire Blast

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.700 
ahead and pull him back with Fire Blast
now<00:00:28.149> I<00:00:28.180> want<00:00:28.390> to<00:00:28.480> demonstrate<00:00:28.689> the<00:00:29.230> range<00:00:29.529> of

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
now I want to demonstrate the range of

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.769 
now I want to demonstrate the range of
frost<00:00:29.980> nova<00:00:30.189> notice<00:00:30.880> that<00:00:30.910> I'm<00:00:31.119> Way<00:00:31.599> out<00:00:31.630> of

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
frost nova notice that I'm Way out of

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:33.569 
frost nova notice that I'm Way out of
melee<00:00:32.200> range<00:00:32.500> and<00:00:32.710> I<00:00:32.770> was<00:00:32.860> still<00:00:33.040> able<00:00:33.220> to<00:00:33.370> hit

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:33.579 
melee range and I was still able to hit

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.139 
melee range and I was still able to hit
him<00:00:33.700> with<00:00:33.820> frost<00:00:34.059> nova<00:00:34.440> this<00:00:35.440> is<00:00:35.590> not<00:00:36.149> very

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
him with frost nova this is not very

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:39.569 
him with frost nova this is not very
obvious<00:00:37.630> to<00:00:37.809> a<00:00:37.840> lot<00:00:38.050> of<00:00:38.170> new<00:00:38.350> frost<00:00:38.710> mages<00:00:39.010> they

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:39.579 
obvious to a lot of new frost mages they

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:41.700 
obvious to a lot of new frost mages they
make<00:00:40.149> the<00:00:40.300> assumption<00:00:40.600> that<00:00:40.750> the<00:00:41.320> range<00:00:41.559> is

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
make the assumption that the range is

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.860 
make the assumption that the range is
actually<00:00:42.010> a<00:00:42.040> lot<00:00:42.130> shorter<00:00:42.400> than<00:00:42.670> it<00:00:42.790> is<00:00:42.970> let<00:00:43.780> me

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
actually a lot shorter than it is let me

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.400 
actually a lot shorter than it is let me
demonstrate<00:00:43.990> the<00:00:44.770> range<00:00:45.040> one<00:00:45.310> more<00:00:45.490> time<00:00:46.410> to

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
demonstrate the range one more time to

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.040 
demonstrate the range one more time to
pull<00:00:47.560> this<00:00:47.680> mob<00:00:47.950> back<00:00:48.220> with<00:00:48.490> ice<00:00:48.970> Lance<00:00:49.330> again

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
pull this mob back with ice Lance again

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.130 
pull this mob back with ice Lance again
notice<00:00:50.440> that<00:00:50.620> he's<00:00:50.770> way<00:00:51.160> out<00:00:51.310> of<00:00:51.430> melee<00:00:51.760> range

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
notice that he's way out of melee range

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.100 
notice that he's way out of melee range
and<00:00:53.140> I<00:00:53.320> can<00:00:53.470> still<00:00:53.710> hit<00:00:53.830> him<00:00:54.690> again<00:00:55.690> that's<00:00:55.990> the

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
and I can still hit him again that's the

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.510 
and I can still hit him again that's the
very<00:00:56.260> first<00:00:56.320> thing<00:00:56.650> that<00:00:56.740> you<00:00:56.890> want<00:00:56.920> to<00:00:57.070> master

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
very first thing that you want to master

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:04.939 
very first thing that you want to master
when<00:00:57.880> becoming<00:00:58.120> a<00:00:58.270> frost<00:00:58.510> mage<00:00:58.720> kiter

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.179 

let's<00:01:05.850> move<00:01:05.969> on<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.329> some<00:01:06.630> very<00:01:06.750> basic<00:01:07.189> hiding

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
let's move on to some very basic hiding

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.190 
let's move on to some very basic hiding
techniques<00:01:08.479> starting<00:01:09.479> with<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.689> frost<00:01:09.930> Bowl

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
techniques starting with the frost Bowl

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.639 
techniques starting with the frost Bowl
kite<00:01:10.460> to<00:01:11.460> find<00:01:11.759> a<00:01:11.909> mob<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.630> tol<00:01:12.960> barad<00:01:12.990> to

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:13.649 
kite to find a mob and tol barad to

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:15.859 
kite to find a mob and tol barad to
demonstrate<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.250> on<00:01:14.460> now<00:01:14.700> I'm<00:01:15.119> going<00:01:15.780> to

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
demonstrate this on now I'm going to

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.480 
demonstrate this on now I'm going to
demonstrate<00:01:16.079> the<00:01:16.710> frostbolt<00:01:17.130> kite<00:01:17.369> without

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
demonstrate the frostbolt kite without

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.300 
demonstrate the frostbolt kite without
using<00:01:18.000> frost<00:01:18.450> nova<00:01:18.979> okay<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.039> we<00:01:20.189> have<00:01:20.219> a

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
using frost nova okay so we have a

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.190 
using frost nova okay so we have a
target<00:01:20.549> right<00:01:20.820> here<00:01:21.119> let's<00:01:21.960> go<00:01:22.049> ahead<00:01:22.110> and

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
target right here let's go ahead and

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.109 
target right here let's go ahead and
open<00:01:22.350> up<00:01:22.560> all<00:01:22.799> we<00:01:22.920> do<00:01:23.069> is<00:01:23.100> repeatedly<00:01:23.729> spam

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
open up all we do is repeatedly spam

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.109 
open up all we do is repeatedly spam
gospel<00:01:24.810> when<00:01:25.649> the<00:01:25.770> mob<00:01:25.920> gets<00:01:26.130> close<00:01:26.490> at<00:01:26.880> that

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
gospel when the mob gets close at that

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.910 
gospel when the mob gets close at that
point<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.539> instantly<00:01:28.079> want<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.350> turn<00:01:28.590> and

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
point you instantly want to turn and

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.760 
point you instantly want to turn and
either<00:01:29.069> start<00:01:29.759> running<00:01:30.119> or<00:01:30.210> strafing<00:01:30.770> like

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
either start running or strafing like

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.700 
either start running or strafing like
that<00:01:32.060> so<00:01:33.060> frostbolt<00:01:33.569> start<00:01:34.170> hiding<00:01:34.439> by

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
that so frostbolt start hiding by

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.120 
that so frostbolt start hiding by
running<00:01:35.069> or<00:01:35.159> strafing<00:01:35.869> now<00:01:36.869> it's<00:01:37.130> typically

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
running or strafing now it's typically

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.529 
running or strafing now it's typically
not<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.549> very<00:01:38.819> good<00:01:38.849> idea<00:01:39.119> when<00:01:39.450> you're

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
not a very good idea when you're

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:41.510 
not a very good idea when you're
frostbolt<00:01:39.990> kiting<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.619> backpedal<00:01:41.099> at<00:01:41.340> any

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
frostbolt kiting to backpedal at any

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.160 
frostbolt kiting to backpedal at any
point<00:01:41.729> simply<00:01:42.390> because<00:01:42.750> it's<00:01:42.899> not<00:01:43.049> very

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
point simply because it's not very

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.929 
point simply because it's not very
efficient<00:01:45.200> let's<00:01:46.200> demonstrate<00:01:46.380> one<00:01:46.890> more

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
efficient let's demonstrate one more

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:48.919 
efficient let's demonstrate one more
frostbolt<00:01:47.939> chi<00:01:48.179> but<00:01:48.360> in<00:01:48.420> this<00:01:48.509> case<00:01:48.689> we're

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:48.929 
frostbolt chi but in this case we're

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:52.370 
frostbolt chi but in this case we're
going<00:01:48.959> to<00:01:49.200> use<00:01:50.450> frost<00:01:51.450> nova<00:01:51.720> in<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.110> middle<00:01:52.319> of

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
going to use frost nova in the middle of

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.319 
going to use frost nova in the middle of
the<00:01:52.439> kite<00:01:52.679> it's<00:01:52.979> pretty<00:01:53.640> straightforward<00:01:53.939> let

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
the kite it's pretty straightforward let

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.870 
the kite it's pretty straightforward let
me<00:01:54.420> go<00:01:54.509> ahead<00:01:54.569> and<00:01:54.659> demonstrate<00:01:54.810> right<00:01:55.289> now

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
me go ahead and demonstrate right now

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.600 
me go ahead and demonstrate right now
for<00:01:56.880> spamming<00:01:57.179> multiple<00:01:58.049> frost<00:01:58.349> bolts<00:01:58.799> we're

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
for spamming multiple frost bolts we're

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.669 
for spamming multiple frost bolts we're
going<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.789> wait<00:01:59.939> until<00:02:00.119> he's<00:02:00.450> within<00:02:00.679> frost

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
going to wait until he's within frost

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:04.279 
going to wait until he's within frost
nova<00:02:01.860> range<00:02:02.220> right<00:02:02.489> now<00:02:02.700> frost<00:02:03.630> nova<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.200> as

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:05.839 
nova range right now frost nova and as
you<00:02:04.380> can<00:02:04.500> see<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.739> set<00:02:04.950> them<00:02:05.069> up<00:02:05.189> for<00:02:05.220> a<00:02:05.520> deep

00:02:05.839 --> 00:02:05.849 
you can see this set them up for a deep

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:08.600 
you can see this set them up for a deep
freeze<00:02:06.209> or<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:06.959> frost<00:02:07.770> fold<00:02:08.039> ice<00:02:08.280> Lance

combination<00:02:09.299> but<00:02:10.289> as<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.590> can<00:02:10.679> see<00:02:10.859> pretty

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
combination but as you can see pretty

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:20.440 
combination but as you can see pretty
straightforward

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.600 

you

let's<00:02:24.390> now<00:02:24.510> move<00:02:24.690> on<00:02:24.960> to<00:02:24.990> arguably<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.190> most

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
let's now move on to arguably the most

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.820 
let's now move on to arguably the most
powerful<00:02:26.430> form<00:02:27.180> of<00:02:27.450> multiple<00:02:27.990> target<00:02:28.380> kiting

powerful form of multiple target kiting

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.610 
powerful form of multiple target kiting
in<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.130> game<00:02:29.310> cone<00:02:29.790> of<00:02:29.820> cold<00:02:29.970> kiting<00:02:30.620> let's

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
in the game cone of cold kiting let's

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.560 
in the game cone of cold kiting let's
demonstrate<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:32.460> cone<00:02:32.730> of<00:02:32.760> cool<00:02:33.060> kite<00:02:33.330> on<00:02:33.360> a

do I'm going to pull them back with Fire

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.600 
do I'm going to pull them back with Fire
Blast<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:43.980> then<00:02:44.550> I'm<00:02:44.670> going<00:02:44.820> to<00:02:44.970> show<00:02:45.720> you<00:02:45.780> how

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
Blast and then I'm going to show you how

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.950 
Blast and then I'm going to show you how
momentarily<00:02:47.610> back<00:02:47.700> peddling<00:02:48.510> can<00:02:48.660> actually

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
momentarily back peddling can actually

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.170 
momentarily back peddling can actually
make<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:50.340> landing<00:02:50.700> of<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.880> cone<00:02:51.030> of<00:02:51.060> cold

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
make the the landing of the cone of cold

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.060 
make the the landing of the cone of cold
a<00:02:51.390> little<00:02:51.540> bit<00:02:51.750> easier<00:02:51.900> okay<00:02:52.709> so<00:02:52.770> looks<00:02:53.010> like

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
a little bit easier okay so looks like

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.699 
a little bit easier okay so looks like
he<00:02:53.310> is<00:02:53.340> that<00:02:53.700> a<00:02:53.730> brain<00:02:53.970> just<00:02:54.120> pull<00:02:54.330> this<00:02:54.480> one

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
he is that a brain just pull this one

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.550 
he is that a brain just pull this one
it's<00:02:55.709> Fire<00:02:55.980> Blast<00:02:56.810> make<00:02:57.810> sure<00:02:57.959> that<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.320> coast

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
it's Fire Blast make sure that the coast

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.810 
it's Fire Blast make sure that the coast
is<00:02:58.709> clear<00:02:58.800> now<00:02:59.340> we're<00:02:59.459> going<00:02:59.580> to<00:02:59.640> start

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
is clear now we're going to start

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.030 
is clear now we're going to start
backpedaling<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.810> you<00:03:01.470> can<00:03:01.620> hit<00:03:01.739> him<00:03:01.860> from

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
backpedaling and you can hit him from

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.430 
backpedaling and you can hit him from
pretty<00:03:02.820> far<00:03:02.880> back<00:03:03.330> there<00:03:03.630> again<00:03:03.810> just<00:03:04.320> like

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
pretty far back there again just like

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.370 
pretty far back there again just like
frost<00:03:04.860> nova<00:03:05.540> you're<00:03:06.540> able<00:03:06.780> to<00:03:06.870> do<00:03:06.959> this<00:03:07.110> while

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
frost nova you're able to do this while

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.860 
frost nova you're able to do this while
staying<00:03:07.739> outside<00:03:07.980> of<00:03:08.310> his<00:03:08.400> melee<00:03:08.760> range<00:03:09.060> okay

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
staying outside of his melee range okay

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.949 
staying outside of his melee range okay
now<00:03:10.080> he's<00:03:10.230> coming<00:03:10.830> and<00:03:10.950> range<00:03:11.100> again<00:03:11.810> see<00:03:12.810> it's

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
now he's coming and range again see it's

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.840 
now he's coming and range again see it's
a<00:03:13.020> lot<00:03:13.170> easier<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.680> just<00:03:13.950> backpedal<00:03:14.250> for<00:03:14.820> a

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
a lot easier to just backpedal for a

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.430 
a lot easier to just backpedal for a
couple<00:03:15.120> of<00:03:15.209> seconds<00:03:15.660> in<00:03:15.840> order<00:03:16.080> to<00:03:16.170> hit<00:03:16.320> with

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
couple of seconds in order to hit with

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.370 
couple of seconds in order to hit with
the<00:03:16.530> cone<00:03:16.680> of<00:03:16.709> cold<00:03:16.860> than<00:03:17.670> it<00:03:17.790> is<00:03:17.940> to<00:03:18.380> try

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
the cone of cold than it is to try

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.910 
the cone of cold than it is to try
another<00:03:19.760> approach<00:03:20.760> like<00:03:21.360> doing<00:03:21.660> a<00:03:21.810> spin<00:03:22.680> turn

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
another approach like doing a spin turn

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.790 
another approach like doing a spin turn
cone<00:03:23.250> of<00:03:23.400> cold<00:03:23.430> like<00:03:23.940> that<00:03:24.500> just<00:03:25.500> a<00:03:25.590> lot<00:03:25.770> easier

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
cone of cold like that just a lot easier

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.820 
cone of cold like that just a lot easier
to<00:03:26.720> backpedal<00:03:27.720> and<00:03:27.959> use<00:03:28.140> cone<00:03:28.350> of<00:03:28.470> cold<00:03:28.500> when

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
to backpedal and use cone of cold when

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:36.520 
to backpedal and use cone of cold when
you're<00:03:28.920> kiting<00:03:29.220> like<00:03:29.370> this

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.120 

before<00:03:37.459> we<00:03:37.610> move<00:03:37.850> on<00:03:38.060> to<00:03:38.360> the<00:03:38.569> topic<00:03:38.959> of<00:03:39.319> hiding

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
before we move on to the topic of hiding

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.730 
before we move on to the topic of hiding
multiple<00:03:40.610> mobs<00:03:40.850> with<00:03:41.150> cone<00:03:41.360> of<00:03:41.540> cold<00:03:41.569> we<00:03:42.500> need

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:42.740 
multiple mobs with cone of cold we need

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.890 
multiple mobs with cone of cold we need
to<00:03:42.950> cover<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:43.550> topic<00:03:43.940> of<00:03:44.150> grouping<00:03:44.750> and

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
to cover the topic of grouping and

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.360 
to cover the topic of grouping and
gathering<00:03:45.290> mobs<00:03:45.500> now<00:03:45.830> there<00:03:46.010> are<00:03:46.130> several

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
gathering mobs now there are several

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.940 
gathering mobs now there are several
ways<00:03:46.610> of<00:03:46.819> doing<00:03:47.090> this<00:03:47.140> let<00:03:48.140> me<00:03:48.230> show<00:03:48.380> you<00:03:48.410> an

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
ways of doing this let me show you an

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.270 
ways of doing this let me show you an
old<00:03:49.160> school<00:03:49.610> way<00:03:49.850> of<00:03:49.880> doing<00:03:50.240> it<00:03:50.980> cast<00:03:51.980> ice

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
old school way of doing it cast ice

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.090 
old school way of doing it cast ice
barrier<00:03:52.640> mount<00:03:53.300> up<00:03:53.540> and<00:03:53.720> then<00:03:54.230> literally<00:03:54.860> go

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
barrier mount up and then literally go

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.690 
barrier mount up and then literally go
in<00:03:55.250> and<00:03:55.370> start<00:03:55.430> body<00:03:55.850> pulling<00:03:56.209> like<00:03:56.690> this<00:03:57.700> once

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
in and start body pulling like this once

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.610 
in and start body pulling like this once
you<00:03:58.790> have<00:03:59.000> as<00:03:59.209> many<00:03:59.420> as<00:03:59.720> you<00:03:59.870> want<00:04:00.080> to<00:04:00.290> gather

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
you have as many as you want to gather

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.920 
you have as many as you want to gather
at<00:04:01.459> that<00:04:01.730> point<00:04:02.000> when<00:04:02.180> you<00:04:02.270> start<00:04:02.569> doing<00:04:02.690> as

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
at that point when you start doing as

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.360 
at that point when you start doing as
you<00:04:02.989> start<00:04:03.230> circling<00:04:03.590> them<00:04:03.980> in<00:04:04.160> a<00:04:04.220> very

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
you start circling them in a very

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.330 
you start circling them in a very
massive<00:04:04.730> circle<00:04:05.330> like<00:04:05.510> this<00:04:05.860> the<00:04:06.860> more<00:04:07.040> times

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
massive circle like this the more times

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.490 
massive circle like this the more times
you<00:04:07.459> circle<00:04:07.940> the<00:04:08.180> closer<00:04:08.540> the<00:04:08.840> entire<00:04:09.170> pack<00:04:09.470> of

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
you circle the closer the entire pack of

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.400 
you circle the closer the entire pack of
mobs<00:04:09.920> will<00:04:10.280> get<00:04:10.540> eventually<00:04:11.540> they<00:04:11.750> will<00:04:11.959> turn

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
mobs will get eventually they will turn

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.520 
mobs will get eventually they will turn
into<00:04:12.560> what<00:04:13.040> appears<00:04:13.130> to<00:04:13.459> be<00:04:13.489> like<00:04:13.700> one<00:04:14.000> mob

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
into what appears to be like one mob

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.780 
into what appears to be like one mob
okay<00:04:15.530> at<00:04:15.620> this<00:04:15.709> point<00:04:15.980> you<00:04:16.160> could<00:04:16.280> just<00:04:16.430> jump

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
okay at this point you could just jump

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.310 
okay at this point you could just jump
off<00:04:17.000> and<00:04:17.269> hit<00:04:17.359> them<00:04:17.510> with<00:04:17.600> a<00:04:17.630> cone<00:04:17.870> a<00:04:17.900> pole<00:04:18.140> like

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
off and hit them with a cone a pole like

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.240 
off and hit them with a cone a pole like
this<00:04:20.230> see<00:04:21.230> that<00:04:21.410> looks<00:04:21.859> like<00:04:21.919> we've<00:04:22.070> pulled

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
this see that looks like we've pulled

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.880 
this see that looks like we've pulled
some<00:04:22.720> other<00:04:23.720> ads<00:04:24.020> right<00:04:24.380> here<00:04:24.590> with<00:04:24.740> that

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
some other ads right here with that

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.770 
some other ads right here with that
that's<00:04:25.310> the<00:04:25.580> circling<00:04:26.210> method<00:04:26.510> that's<00:04:26.660> a

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
that's the circling method that's a

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.150 
that's the circling method that's a
method<00:04:27.080> that<00:04:27.110> I<00:04:27.230> used<00:04:27.380> to<00:04:27.500> use<00:04:27.620> way<00:04:27.830> back<00:04:28.010> in

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
method that I used to use way back in

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:35.270 
method that I used to use way back in
vanilla

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.120 

okay<00:04:36.240> let's<00:04:36.480> move<00:04:36.600> on<00:04:36.840> to<00:04:37.080> another<00:04:37.410> method

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
okay let's move on to another method

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.860 
okay let's move on to another method
that<00:04:38.310> you<00:04:38.580> can<00:04:38.730> use<00:04:38.910> to<00:04:39.120> group<00:04:39.480> and<00:04:39.690> gather

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
that you can use to group and gather

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.160 
that you can use to group and gather
acts<00:04:40.440> of<00:04:40.650> mobs<00:04:40.970> this<00:04:41.970> will<00:04:42.150> be<00:04:42.300> similar<00:04:42.930> to<00:04:43.080> the

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
acts of mobs this will be similar to the

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.570 
acts of mobs this will be similar to the
other<00:04:43.260> one<00:04:43.650> except<00:04:43.980> that<00:04:44.100> we<00:04:44.220> will<00:04:44.400> gather

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
other one except that we will gather

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.700 
other one except that we will gather
them<00:04:44.940> with<00:04:45.150> ice<00:04:45.389> block<00:04:45.720> this<00:04:45.930> is<00:04:46.110> probably<00:04:46.470> the

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
them with ice block this is probably the

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.409 
them with ice block this is probably the
easiest<00:04:47.220> way<00:04:47.490> that<00:04:47.669> you<00:04:47.730> can<00:04:47.850> gather<00:04:48.060> pack

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
easiest way that you can gather pack

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:50.450 
easiest way that you can gather pack
some<00:04:48.630> ops<00:04:48.840> so<00:04:49.560> it's<00:04:49.650> the<00:04:49.710> same<00:04:49.740> story<00:04:50.250> just

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
some ops so it's the same story just

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.340 
some ops so it's the same story just
open<00:04:50.730> up<00:04:50.790> by<00:04:50.970> body<00:04:51.270> pulling<00:04:51.630> as<00:04:51.930> many<00:04:52.169> as<00:04:52.230> you

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
open up by body pulling as many as you

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.420 
open up by body pulling as many as you
want<00:04:52.560> like<00:04:53.460> this<00:04:54.620> try<00:04:55.620> to<00:04:55.680> get<00:04:55.860> sort<00:04:56.190> of<00:04:56.220> in<00:04:56.340> the

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
want like this try to get sort of in the

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.920 
want like this try to get sort of in the
middle<00:04:56.610> of<00:04:56.760> them<00:04:56.940> jump<00:04:57.330> off<00:04:57.510> and<00:04:57.660> then<00:04:57.780> ice

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
middle of them jump off and then ice

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:08.320 
middle of them jump off and then ice
block<00:04:58.230> right<00:04:58.470> in<00:04:58.560> the<00:04:58.620> middle

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.760 

let's<00:05:09.330> now<00:05:09.420> move<00:05:09.600> on<00:05:09.810> to<00:05:10.080> the<00:05:10.260> third<00:05:10.470> method

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
let's now move on to the third method

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.800 
let's now move on to the third method
that<00:05:11.130> you<00:05:11.280> can<00:05:11.430> use<00:05:11.730> to<00:05:12.000> group<00:05:12.390> and<00:05:12.600> gather

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
that you can use to group and gather

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.530 
that you can use to group and gather
massive<00:05:13.440> packs<00:05:13.740> of<00:05:13.950> mobs<00:05:14.330> this<00:05:15.330> method

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
massive packs of mobs this method

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.380 
massive packs of mobs this method
utilizes<00:05:16.260> the<00:05:16.650> ring<00:05:17.010> of<00:05:17.160> frost<00:05:17.280> spell<00:05:17.730> now

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
utilizes the ring of frost spell now

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:19.610 
utilizes the ring of frost spell now
there<00:05:18.600> is<00:05:18.690> something<00:05:19.020> that<00:05:19.110> you<00:05:19.200> need<00:05:19.350> to<00:05:19.380> keep

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
there is something that you need to keep

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.700 
there is something that you need to keep
in<00:05:19.800> mind<00:05:19.830> when<00:05:20.220> using<00:05:20.430> ring<00:05:20.760> of<00:05:20.880> frost<00:05:21.710> even

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
in mind when using ring of frost even

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.590 
in mind when using ring of frost even
though<00:05:22.800> the<00:05:22.920> spell<00:05:23.160> itself<00:05:23.310> is<00:05:23.670> instant<00:05:24.210> the

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
though the spell itself is instant the

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.810 
though the spell itself is instant the
effect<00:05:25.050> of<00:05:25.200> ring<00:05:25.410> of<00:05:25.530> frost<00:05:25.620> takes<00:05:26.490> three

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
effect of ring of frost takes three

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.180 
effect of ring of frost takes three
seconds<00:05:27.270> to<00:05:27.420> coalesce<00:05:27.810> so<00:05:28.620> you<00:05:28.710> need<00:05:28.950> to<00:05:29.010> keep

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
seconds to coalesce so you need to keep

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.470 
seconds to coalesce so you need to keep
this<00:05:29.340> in<00:05:29.550> mind<00:05:29.580> when<00:05:30.120> you're<00:05:30.210> going<00:05:30.360> to<00:05:30.420> be

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480 
this in mind when you're going to be

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.360 
this in mind when you're going to be
using<00:05:30.660> the<00:05:30.960> spell<00:05:31.260> the<00:05:31.500> group<00:05:31.710> or<00:05:31.860> gather<00:05:32.040> mobs

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
using the spell the group or gather mobs

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.940 
using the spell the group or gather mobs
rather<00:05:33.270> than<00:05:33.510> thinking<00:05:33.900> where<00:05:34.440> do<00:05:34.530> I<00:05:34.590> want<00:05:34.830> the

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
rather than thinking where do I want the

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.470 
rather than thinking where do I want the
mops<00:05:35.190> to<00:05:35.310> be<00:05:35.460> right<00:05:35.670> now<00:05:35.820> you<00:05:35.880> have<00:05:36.120> to<00:05:36.270> think

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:36.480 
mops to be right now you have to think

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.540 
mops to be right now you have to think
where<00:05:36.840> do<00:05:37.260> I<00:05:37.320> want<00:05:37.590> them<00:05:37.740> to<00:05:37.830> be<00:05:37.890> frozen<00:05:38.220> in

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
where do I want them to be frozen in

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.130 
where do I want them to be frozen in
three<00:05:38.880> seconds<00:05:39.240> where<00:05:39.420> am<00:05:39.510> I<00:05:39.600> going<00:05:39.750> to<00:05:39.870> be<00:05:40.110> in

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140 
three seconds where am I going to be in

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.350 
three seconds where am I going to be in
three<00:05:40.500> seconds<00:05:40.890> so<00:05:41.760> let<00:05:42.030> me<00:05:42.090> go<00:05:42.210> ahead<00:05:42.240> and

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
three seconds so let me go ahead and

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.660 
three seconds so let me go ahead and
demonstrate<00:05:42.570> this<00:05:43.110> approach<00:05:43.470> on<00:05:43.740> some<00:05:44.460> mobs

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:44.670 
demonstrate this approach on some mobs

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:48.380 
demonstrate this approach on some mobs
one<00:05:45.000> more<00:05:45.150> time<00:05:45.360> in<00:05:45.510> tol<00:05:45.720> barad<00:05:47.300> okay<00:05:48.300> I'm

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.390 
one more time in tol barad okay I'm

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.200 
one more time in tol barad okay I'm
actually<00:05:48.570> going<00:05:48.870> to<00:05:49.100> body<00:05:50.100> pull<00:05:50.460> like<00:05:50.940> I<00:05:51.060> did

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
actually going to body pull like I did

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:57.800 
actually going to body pull like I did
before<00:05:51.330> just<00:05:51.870> grab<00:05:52.560> these<00:05:52.740> ones<00:05:52.980> right<00:05:53.070> here

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:03.159 

get<00:05:58.200> him<00:05:58.410> started<00:05:58.740> circling<00:06:00.530> okay<00:06:01.669> now<00:06:02.669> I

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:03.169 
get him started circling okay now I

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:06.110 
get him started circling okay now I
anticipate<00:06:04.169> that<00:06:04.320> they're<00:06:04.470> going<00:06:04.620> to<00:06:04.830> be<00:06:05.250> back

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
anticipate that they're going to be back

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.409 
anticipate that they're going to be back
here<00:06:06.570> in<00:06:06.750> about<00:06:07.410> three<00:06:07.770> seconds<00:06:08.130> as<00:06:09.030> long<00:06:09.389> as

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:09.419 
here in about three seconds as long as

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:11.210 
here in about three seconds as long as
