00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:07.799
 hi to all neo anderson could a 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.330
 game this point like today I you 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.620
 present and it's still quite rare 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.059
 to be reported because it's very 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.210
 for a long time that I had not done a 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.920
 unpacking edition so in general 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.810
 it was the collector's editions that I 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.060
 bought in store and I unpacked 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.100
 I think the last one was 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.420
 catherine there was zero blade chronicles 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.490
 but I think the last one was 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.279
 collector mission of catherine with the 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.170
 t-shirt and the phenomenal pizza box 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.120
 this time it's a kit unpacking 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.370
 press that we received from 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.160
 so sony from wim from ab 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.989
 communication is that of little big 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.660
 planet on ps vita 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.270
 so we have a very nice box with a 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.039
 made very very friendly very sweet to 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.809
 touch we will unpack wac 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:57.180
 of course you see that it's not 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:59.640
 obvious and milan ac enormous burgundy 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:04.260
 if we do not want to tear it down 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:08.010
 so what do we have in the box we 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.560
 has a cd the established planet that contains 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.020
 do aces so is the assets that's 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.119
 the game pictures the official videos 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.520
 it allows to illustrate an article with 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.500
 photos that stop without having to go 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.810
 on the internet and start typing in 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.659
 google images so it's very convenient 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:29.220
 for us journalists 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:34.369
 we have a littlebigplanet book that 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.369
 actually contains an error post me 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.829
 with a sackboy made up of others 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.740
 sackboy very nice and lo and shows 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.030
 no planet sme it's pretty funny 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.189
 because at the beginning, one's headdress is an art 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.909
 book and actually when we unfold it's a 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.009
 post then we have a little sackboy who 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.909
 actually comes 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:00.270
 contained all the surprises of this 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.119
 edition do not worry it was planned 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.649
 it's the only way 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.649
 to open the bazaar properly 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.520
 so you see the edition is very 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.910
 nice because she talks to the 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:17.030
 littlebigplanet times on ps vita and 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.420
 of littlebigplanet karting why and 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.380
 well just because you have 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.390
 a code that allows you to download 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.260
 and big planet on ps vita but also 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.010
 a code that allows you to download 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.330
 a preview version so a version 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.690
 still developing the workbench 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:38.480
 karting planet so we have a small 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:39.980
 book is very nice here with the 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.350
 so classic mentions so for 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:47.780
 littlebigplanet 2 which is played at once 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:48.790
 on vita and on ps3 via the cruise 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.560
 control 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.030

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.770
 posters on the karting flat carpet and 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.870
 especially necessarily all 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.730
 specificities very useful for writing a 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.390

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.290
 which actually contains the code that allows 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:15.110
 download the app in preview version 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:18.110
