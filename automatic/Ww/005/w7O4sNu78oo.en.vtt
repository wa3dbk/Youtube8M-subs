00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
experience we're always looking at what

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.580 
experience we're always looking at what
is<00:00:54.220> the<00:00:54.340> improvement<00:00:54.910> that<00:00:55.230> we<00:00:56.230> need<00:00:56.380> to<00:00:56.500> get

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
is the improvement that we need to get

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.110 
is the improvement that we need to get
to<00:00:56.800> to<00:00:56.950> get<00:00:57.040> something<00:00:57.250> super<00:00:57.610> mark<00:00:57.850> there<00:00:58.060> are

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
to to get something super mark there are

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.550 
to to get something super mark there are
still<00:00:58.330> a<00:00:58.360> few<00:00:58.450> more<00:00:58.780> things<00:00:58.989> to<00:00:59.110> go<00:00:59.320> before

00:00:59.550 --> 00:00:59.560 
still a few more things to go before

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.650 
still a few more things to go before
it's<00:00:59.830> consumer<00:01:00.370> ready<00:01:00.550> we're<00:01:00.820> still<00:01:01.030> trying

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
it's consumer ready we're still trying

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.990 
it's consumer ready we're still trying
to<00:01:01.690> figure<00:01:01.840> out<00:01:01.989> what<00:01:02.230> is<00:01:02.380> the<00:01:02.950> our<00:01:03.100> input<00:01:03.460> also

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
to figure out what is the our input also

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.490 
to figure out what is the our input also
you<00:01:04.239> know<00:01:04.360> right<00:01:04.510> now<00:01:04.660> we're<00:01:04.870> keyboard<00:01:05.380> and

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
you know right now we're keyboard and

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.500 
you know right now we're keyboard and
mouse<00:01:05.560> or<00:01:05.770> gamepad<00:01:05.860> what<00:01:06.520> is<00:01:06.640> VR<00:01:07.030> input<00:01:07.420> and

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
mouse or gamepad what is VR input and

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.490 
mouse or gamepad what is VR input and
it's<00:01:07.630> probably<00:01:07.780> something<00:01:08.200> a<00:01:08.260> little<00:01:08.470> more

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
it's probably something a little more

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
here really here and like I know that

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.469 
here really here and like I know that
I'm<00:01:33.430> talking<00:01:33.610> to<00:01:33.850> people<00:01:33.880> who<00:01:34.240> are<00:01:34.270> in<00:01:34.390> this

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
I'm talking to people who are in this

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.109 
I'm talking to people who are in this
room<00:01:34.540> but<00:01:35.470> I've<00:01:35.590> kind<00:01:35.800> of<00:01:35.830> mentally<00:01:36.610> lost<00:01:36.820> the

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
room but I've kind of mentally lost the

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:43.230 
room but I've kind of mentally lost the
topography<00:01:37.810> of<00:01:37.840> this<00:01:38.020> room<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.970> what<00:01:43.120> do<00:01:43.180> you

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
topography of this room so what do you

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.410 
topography of this room so what do you
think<00:01:43.420> I'm<00:01:44.050> just<00:01:44.200> gonna<00:01:44.320> keep<00:01:44.560> stone<00:01:44.860> guy<00:01:48.420> and

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
think I'm just gonna keep stone guy and

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.390 
think I'm just gonna keep stone guy and
this<00:01:49.570> would<00:01:49.750> make<00:01:49.870> plane<00:01:50.170> flights<00:01:50.440> pass<00:01:50.740> by<00:01:50.979> so

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
this would make plane flights pass by so

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.149 
this would make plane flights pass by so
quickly<00:01:51.880> like<00:01:52.600> the<00:01:52.750> room<00:01:52.960> that<00:01:53.170> I<00:01:53.200> physically

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
quickly like the room that I physically

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.190 
quickly like the room that I physically
am<00:01:54.370> sitting<00:01:54.700> in<00:01:54.760> right<00:01:54.970> now<00:01:55.000> I<00:01:55.150> kind<00:01:55.840> of<00:01:55.930> forget

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
am sitting in right now I kind of forget

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.120 
am sitting in right now I kind of forget
what<00:01:56.350> it<00:01:56.440> looks<00:01:56.560> like

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
what it looks like

and I've used the oculus rift before but
like<00:02:09.690> when<00:02:09.840> they<00:02:09.929> saw<00:02:10.080> that<00:02:10.259> HD<00:02:10.739> 1080p<00:02:11.400> had<00:02:11.790> set

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
like when they saw that HD 1080p had set

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.300 
like when they saw that HD 1080p had set
down<00:02:12.209> over<00:02:12.540> my<00:02:12.660> eyeballs<00:02:13.080> it<00:02:13.319> was<00:02:13.440> like<00:02:13.620> oh<00:02:13.890> man

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
it's like actually being there oculus

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.509 
it's like actually being there oculus
kind<00:02:16.230> of<00:02:16.290> wants<00:02:16.470> consumers<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:17.040> wait<00:02:17.220> for<00:02:17.459> the
