00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.690
 hello my dear viewer you 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.920
 welcomes plumbing this run 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.420
 lbz on sa 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.250
 for t-55a I want to run ahead in advance 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.630
 say that now half the viewers 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.259
 just say fufufu artillery 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.259
 fuck off 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:34.200
 I don't like artillery myself I don't like 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:36.690
 when it falls on me to play it 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.520
 something, too, as something not really pulls me 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.160
 because firstly it does not work 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.160
 secondly i'm not able to third i dont just 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.820
 I do not want to, but since the task is set 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.499
 the problem needs to be solved all just by this 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.050
 about the same pumped by by 

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:54.690
 british horse top 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.999
 but he specifically I was pumped for 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.699
 that's exactly the task that is now on 

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:01.859
 screen but take this opportunity already 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.710
 try to share those moments 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.110
 which caused difficulties firstly 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.690
 that was the task of sa 5 which sounded 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.909
 as follows 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.700
 eight times the strength of its 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.540
 cars I did not think immediately grabbed there 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.480
 in 304 then I took there I had in in 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.670
 207 at that time still not 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.010
 it turned out that then my God thought 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.350
 Why is everyone so stupid then actually 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.620
 here's a brother himself only 350 total 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.550
 pda 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.500
 multiply by 8 we get 2 802 800 sets 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.370
 that is, and throw at all not difficult 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.250
 the task is to hang one vantage still there 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:44.070
 12 successful shots with a task if not 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.400
 elementary this pretty simple here 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.250
 further tormented with puzzles number 10 where 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.890
 need to destroy the enemy artillery by 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.570
 track but firstly if you have disabled and 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.880
 all sorts of special effects of these tracers 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:01.409
 almost invisible 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.329
 This is the second most important thing that many 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.299
 Of course, they use cheats to 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.700
 shoot artillery on the highway but I'm like 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.370
 honest man i'm not fundamentally 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.360
 use no bot cheats and the 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.380
 like garbage 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.420
 so for me it was important here but in 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.610
 I ended up on a tundra map i'm there 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.980
 did the first time because in battle 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.440
 there were four artillery and now 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.930
 before you replay this is sa 11 square 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.120
 defeat one shot one kill and 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.720
 hurt 2 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.160
 It is for this that I pumped this stupid 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.900
 British art because on 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.599
 masthead even I do not get any 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.790
 too small splash here splash 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.319
 golden projectile just huge here 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.810
 now pay attention will this 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.510
 shot right behind the stone throwing in 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.840
 first secondly cover two but just 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:55.739
 there are no difficulties broads one ready 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.680
 and 2 crippled that's all this 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:01.950
 was full 6 or 7 fight on horse 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:05.040
 literally 67 battles took to 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:08.219
 do this task she pre top 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.709
 artillery like not trying in any way just 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:13.019
 not in any set from the axis but he has splash 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.389
 in principle, quite good of course 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.129
 but in my opinion it's hard 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:19.799
 anyway for me it was hard 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:22.980
 the easiest thing of course to do is 2 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:25.530
 artillery is American t92 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.340
 she has a huge splash or this one 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.900
 horse on which I am now 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:35.819
 Well, let's go for the rest 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:38.700
 what we have there why so problem number 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.799
 13 art battery is personal or total 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.290
 coax the enemy with at least 25 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.659
 percent total damage to your team 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.150
 done too elementary go to 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:50.189
 top bertha or any other 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.909
 but on any other you need to get to the top 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:56.849
 just inviting the guys in the platoon 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:57.510
 totally random u which matter to 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.750
 than they 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:03.510
 the main thing that they were top and invited 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:07.109
 they and you in total together 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.900
 how to do nothing 14 task is the same 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:12.449
 the most that is, there need to bring 4000 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.540
 damage tyazhey or Fri-Sau just 

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:19.889
 the only thing you want to choose 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:22.800
 strands of the platoon's task and all 15 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:23.729
 it must also be quite difficult I performed 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.530
 set from axis 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:28.650
 there you need to do three thousand damage 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:31.560
 first place by experience and damage to the team 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:34.139
 that is, on top art this task 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:39.449
 extremely difficult I even managed 7000 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:41.729
 throw on the horse but nevertheless the first 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:43.800
 place by damage yes and by experience fig 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:46.380
 because there is some kinda firefighter 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.320
 a whole bunch of damage got more experience 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.389
 than i ended up flying she bureau then 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.509
 there is please there, too, from the second 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:56.759
 or from the third time did well actually 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:59.669
 on this I have probably all the video 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:02.550
 coming to an end I hope that if u 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:05.159
 someone having problems with lbz write 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:08.190
 in the comments and more experienced guys 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:08.610
 who have already done these foreheads I think 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.550

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:14.250
 just help advice let's help 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:18.000
 to each other let's not use cheats 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.889
 let's do everything honestly and beautifully well 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.439

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:25.889
 put like on channel if you like this video 

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:29.330
 at least something helped a bit 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:29.330
 for now
