00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello to all these blu I hope you 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.270
 be well 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.719
 in any case I'm fine and we get 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.570
 find for a new video this 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.780
 once we are not on pokemon and 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:18.230
 yeah but it's a video 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.250
 tutorial actually to show you 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:24.510
 something that I discovered there is to 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.630
 hardly three minutes the direccte it is 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.160
 sure disappointed but then it's a tutorial 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.330
 mainly maquin for those who are 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.750
 on pc who follow me 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.790
 it does not concern you 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.600
 always look 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.510
 look at the tutorial if that's it 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.340
 interested do as you want but 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.789
 the tutorial saint-therese is interested 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.200
 that's going to interest more those who are 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.899
 on mac because it's really a 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.079
 good tip I discovered no 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:56.010
 tutorial on the internet by one of that so 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.750
 I do it is to put in fact the 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.730
 speaking the language of death put myself 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.010
 so the seedling emulator but if you 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.629
 do not know you type on google there 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.290
 there are plenty of videos that already speak about it 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.290
 do not talk about it 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.700
 so to change the language of death 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.740
 mute you have to go to preferences 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.250
 then all that a little general 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.689
 wound that's it saad tells you touched by 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:25.229
 these revelations 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:26.400
 be based on firmware with my very good 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.180
 inc 500 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.970
 or not I English accent rotten I 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.420
 know but this is precisely for the 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:40.680
 change to french so here you are 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:45.750
 go here hop that we do not touch it 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:48.960
 in fear - you choose images that's 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.869
 as you want but what we 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.810
 most interesting is that we figure 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:57.210
 terral internal figurines 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.799
 firmware with my accent 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.500
 there I just made a French accent 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.479
 free then you can choose your 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.200
 favorite color 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.200
 if it is not very interesting 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:23.220
 yeah I'm struggling badly we do not care 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:33.290
 it's the message of the thing and that's it 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:33.290
 your date of birth and at m but ok 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.880
 it's good it's good it's good and what 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.650
 we care the most is the gouache and 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.860
 there you can choose Japanese English 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.350
 French German Italian or Spanish 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.910
 but I think the most interesting 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.959
 for you it is to choose the language 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.630
 French 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:57.630
 here we are in French on ten pu but 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.989
 it's totally totally cool 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.989
 death that kills 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.290
 I will be able to delay 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.180
 others mind on others I 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.370
 was not in French and in the language of 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.930
 basic platinum ok and in language 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.250
 french all the other pokemon 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.480
 versions are in French and in language 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.610
 basic but even some pokemon like 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.549
 for example mystery dungeon or mario 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.910
 jean marc and 64 mario kart or something 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.530
 like that 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.049
 most games actually are in 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.680
 English to the basic languages â€‹â€‹and 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:30.750
 now the language we will force to 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.890
 change of language it's going all the 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:37.790
 time to be in French finally so that's it 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.980
 I hope this tutorial has helped you 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.299

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.910
