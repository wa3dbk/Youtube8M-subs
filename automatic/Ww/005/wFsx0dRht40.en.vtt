know how to read you can you can go

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.179 
know how to read you can you can go
ahead<00:01:01.960> and<00:01:02.050> figure<00:01:02.350> those<00:01:02.649> numbers<00:01:03.069> out<00:01:03.280> um

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
ahead and figure those numbers out um

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:10.899 
yeah so on to my kill death ratio as you

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:12.420 
yeah so on to my kill death ratio as you
can<00:01:11.020> see<00:01:11.140> it's<00:01:11.259> a<00:01:11.350> it's<00:01:11.530> three<00:01:11.740> two<00:01:11.920> one<00:01:12.100> blast

200 300 kills um so anyway I don't want
it<00:01:40.810> up<00:01:40.930> there<00:01:40.960> you<00:01:41.350> don't<00:01:41.469> want<00:01:41.590> it<00:01:41.770> out<00:01:41.890> there

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
no one wants it up there so why is it up

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.260 
no one wants it up there so why is it up
there<00:01:44.229> it's<00:01:44.979> because<00:01:45.430> everyone<00:01:45.880> use<00:01:46.030> it<00:01:46.180> when

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
there it's because everyone use it when

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.300 
there it's because everyone use it when
the<00:01:46.359> game<00:01:46.570> came<00:01:46.869> out<00:01:47.049> and<00:01:47.320> I<00:01:47.469> just<00:01:47.710> followed

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
the game came out and I just followed

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.580 
the game came out and I just followed
the<00:01:48.340> crowd<00:01:48.670> I<00:01:49.090> guess<00:01:49.479> it<00:01:49.630> was<00:01:49.750> the<00:01:49.869> best<00:01:49.990> gun<00:01:50.259> so

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
the crowd I guess it was the best gun so

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.149 
the crowd I guess it was the best gun so
why<00:01:50.829> not<00:01:51.009> use<00:01:51.219> it<00:01:51.299> anyway<00:01:52.299> on<00:01:52.539> to<00:01:52.719> the

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
why not use it anyway on to the

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.779 
why not use it anyway on to the
killstreaks<00:01:55.109> as<00:01:56.109> you<00:01:57.009> can<00:01:57.159> see<00:01:57.369> those<00:01:57.549> top

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
killstreaks as you can see those top

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:59.639 
killstreaks as you can see those top
five<00:01:58.000> right<00:01:58.210> there<00:01:58.270> chopper<00:01:58.689> gunner<00:01:59.020> is<00:01:59.289> not

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
five right there chopper gunner is not

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:02.520 
five right there chopper gunner is not
on<00:01:59.920> it<00:02:00.219> I<00:02:00.509> find<00:02:01.509> the<00:02:01.630> chopper<00:02:01.899> gunner<00:02:02.259> to<00:02:02.409> be

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
on it I find the chopper gunner to be

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.490 
on it I find the chopper gunner to be
rather<00:02:02.740> shallow<00:02:03.250> and<00:02:03.490> pedantic<00:02:04.200> if<00:02:05.200> you<00:02:05.320> don't

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
rather shallow and pedantic if you don't

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.109 
rather shallow and pedantic if you don't
know<00:02:05.590> what<00:02:05.710> that<00:02:05.740> means<00:02:06.070> then<00:02:06.369> that<00:02:06.429> I'm<00:02:06.820> sorry

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
know what that means then that I'm sorry

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.230
