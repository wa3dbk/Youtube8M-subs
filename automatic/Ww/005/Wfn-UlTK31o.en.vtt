as you can see we moved over most of the
tires<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.469> stuff<00:00:39.980> so<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.070> roof<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.460> just<00:00:41.489> in

some<00:00:47.789> shingles<00:00:48.030> on<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.539> pretty<00:00:49.350> soon<00:00:49.739> but<00:00:50.129> it's

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
some shingles on it pretty soon but it's

not<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.090> huge<00:00:51.539> concern<00:00:51.600> at<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.320> moment<00:00:53.989> we<00:00:54.989> use

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
not a huge concern at the moment we use

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.279 
not a huge concern at the moment we use
7/16<00:00:57.770> OSB<00:00:58.879> for<00:00:59.879> the<00:00:59.940> roofing<00:01:00.210> material<00:01:00.329> 4x8

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
the back one on the front let's see okay

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:17.649 
the back one on the front let's see okay
the<00:01:10.909> supports<00:01:11.909> here<00:01:12.150> are<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:15.259> the<00:01:16.259> roof<00:01:16.439> are

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
the supports here are the the roof are

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.660 
the supports here are the the roof are
eight<00:01:18.659> feet<00:01:18.960> long<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.320> back<00:01:19.500> four<00:01:20.159> feet<00:01:20.430> in

the<00:01:20.909> front<00:01:21.320> the<00:01:22.320> pitch<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.830> just<00:01:23.040> did<00:01:23.220> by

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
the front the pitch I just did by

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.130 
the front the pitch I just did by
eyeball<00:01:24.799> for<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.890> peak<00:01:26.960> probably<00:01:27.960> could<00:01:28.049> have

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
eyeball for the peak probably could have

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.340 
eyeball for the peak probably could have
gone<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.290> little<00:01:28.439> steeper<00:01:28.950> on<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.189> back<00:01:29.340> side

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
gone a little steeper on the back side

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.620 
gone a little steeper on the back side
and<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.470> little<00:01:31.560> steeper<00:01:31.950> on<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.159> front<00:01:32.630> to

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
and a little steeper on the front to

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.609 
and a little steeper on the front to
help<00:01:33.659> with<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.049> snow<00:01:34.320> but<00:01:36.320> that's<00:01:37.320> just<00:01:37.439> the

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
help with the snow but that's just the

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.090 
help with the snow but that's just the
way<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.799> turned<00:01:38.009> out<00:01:39.409> to<00:01:40.409> attach<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.890> on<00:01:40.979> the

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
way it turned out to attach it on the

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.740 
way it turned out to attach it on the
ends<00:01:41.460> here<00:01:41.700> we<00:01:42.299> used<00:01:43.820> on<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.060> corners<00:01:45.450> I

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
ends here we used on the corners I

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.420 
ends here we used on the corners I
figured<00:01:46.590> these<00:01:46.680> are<00:01:46.860> called<00:01:47.070> they're<00:01:47.220> like<00:01:47.340> a

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
figured these are called they're like a

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.719 
figured these are called they're like a
hurricane<00:01:47.700> tie<00:01:50.360> and<00:01:51.360> then<00:01:51.960> we<00:01:52.170> used<00:01:52.729> these

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
hurricane tie and then we used these

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.719 
hurricane tie and then we used these
ones<00:01:54.950> they're<00:01:55.950> actors<00:01:57.380> as<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.530> can<00:01:58.680> see

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
ones they're actors as you can see

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:08.330 
ones they're actors as you can see
and<00:01:59.960> then<00:02:00.960> at<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.259> top<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:05.270> use<00:02:07.039> those<00:02:08.039> kind

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
and then at the top you use those kind

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.720 
and then at the top you use those kind
of<00:02:08.429> plate<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.849> it<00:02:08.970> there<00:02:10.160> now<00:02:11.160> obviously<00:02:11.550> this

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
of plate to it there now obviously this

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.949 
of plate to it there now obviously this
isn't<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.090> way<00:02:12.239> you<00:02:12.300> do<00:02:12.510> it<00:02:12.599> if<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:12.840> were

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
isn't the way you do it if you were

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.160 
isn't the way you do it if you were
building<00:02:13.440> a<00:02:13.650> house<00:02:13.800> and<00:02:14.900> depending<00:02:15.900> on<00:02:15.959> how

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
building a house and depending on how

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.900 
building a house and depending on how
much<00:02:16.380> this<00:02:16.560> flex<00:02:16.860> is<00:02:17.040> we<00:02:17.220> may<00:02:17.400> have<00:02:17.550> to<00:02:17.730> add

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
much this flex is we may have to add

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.290 
much this flex is we may have to add
some<00:02:18.180> collar<00:02:18.390> ties<00:02:18.690> but<00:02:19.110> as<00:02:19.800> of<00:02:19.920> right<00:02:19.950> now<00:02:20.300> it

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
some collar ties but as of right now it

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.150 
some collar ties but as of right now it
seems<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.630> be<00:02:21.720> working<00:02:22.020> fine<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:22.560> actually<00:02:22.860> went

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
seems to be working fine I actually went

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.100 
seems to be working fine I actually went
to<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:23.280> bunch<00:02:23.459> of<00:02:23.640> different<00:02:24.110> home-improvement

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
to a bunch of different home-improvement

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.870 
to a bunch of different home-improvement
stores<00:02:25.739> and<00:02:25.950> looked<00:02:26.069> at<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.340> sheds<00:02:26.580> that<00:02:26.760> they

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
stores and looked at the sheds that they

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.900 
stores and looked at the sheds that they
were<00:02:26.940> selling<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:28.739> you'd<00:02:29.099> be<00:02:29.250> surprised<00:02:29.640> that

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
were selling and you'd be surprised that

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.990 
were selling and you'd be surprised that
what<00:02:30.450> they<00:02:30.599> used<00:02:31.489> these<00:02:32.489> pretty<00:02:32.700> much<00:02:32.790> the

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
what they used these pretty much the

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.120 
what they used these pretty much the
same<00:02:33.180> same<00:02:34.019> system<00:02:34.470> they<00:02:34.590> don't<00:02:34.680> use<00:02:34.920> the

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
same same system they don't use the

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.350 
same same system they don't use the
plates<00:02:35.580> on<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.850> end<00:02:36.000> so<00:02:36.209> just<00:02:36.420> nail<00:02:36.630> them<00:02:36.780> down

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
plates on the end so just nail them down

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.490 
plates on the end so just nail them down
and<00:02:39.470> their<00:02:40.470> walls<00:02:40.709> are<00:02:40.950> much<00:02:42.290> their<00:02:43.290> walls

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
and their walls are much their walls

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.570 
and their walls are much their walls
were<00:02:43.680> much<00:02:43.830> skinnier<00:02:44.340> than<00:02:44.459> these<00:02:46.459> so<00:02:47.459> yeah

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
were much skinnier than these so yeah

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.490 
were much skinnier than these so yeah
the<00:02:47.819> floor<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.569> all<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.870> sides<00:02:49.110> are<00:02:49.290> built

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
the floor and all the sides are built

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.640 
the floor and all the sides are built
out<00:02:49.590> of<00:02:49.650> pallets<00:02:50.069> and<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.310> roof<00:02:50.489> isn't<00:02:51.650> the

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
out of pallets and the roof isn't the

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.949 
out of pallets and the roof isn't the
one<00:02:52.830> downside<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.549> using<00:02:53.610> pallets<00:02:54.269> obviously

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
one downside to using pallets obviously

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.750 
one downside to using pallets obviously
is<00:02:55.080> nothing<00:02:55.410> square<00:02:56.690> so<00:02:57.690> you<00:02:58.489> kind<00:02:59.489> of<00:02:59.549> throws

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
is nothing square so you kind of throws

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.070 
is nothing square so you kind of throws
off<00:02:59.970> all<00:03:00.180> your<00:03:00.360> measurements<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:00.989> everything

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
off all your measurements and everything

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.620 
off all your measurements and everything
so<00:03:01.590> we<00:03:01.709> just<00:03:01.860> did<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.130> best<00:03:02.280> we<00:03:02.400> could<00:03:02.630> and

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
so we just did the best we could and

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:04.729 
so we just did the best we could and
it's<00:03:03.959> turned<00:03:04.290> out<00:03:04.380> all<00:03:04.560> right

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
it's turned out all right

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:13.599 
it's turned out all right
actually<00:03:05.690> you<00:03:06.690> can<00:03:06.870> see<00:03:07.370> those<00:03:08.370> boys<00:03:08.820> attach

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:13.609 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:17.210 

yeah<00:03:14.609> we<00:03:15.030> got<00:03:15.180> a<00:03:15.209> roof<00:03:15.390> on<00:03:15.570> it<00:03:15.630> now<00:03:15.980> one<00:03:16.980> of<00:03:17.010> the

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
yeah we got a roof on it now one of the

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.250 
yeah we got a roof on it now one of the
tractors<00:03:17.940> is<00:03:18.090> in<00:03:18.269> here<00:03:19.160> and<00:03:20.870> you<00:03:21.870> know<00:03:21.989> I<00:03:22.019> still

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
tractors is in here and you know I still

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.890 
tractors is in here and you know I still
got<00:03:22.320> a<00:03:22.440> lot<00:03:22.590> of<00:03:22.700> planking<00:03:23.700> to<00:03:23.850> do<00:03:24.000> I'm<00:03:24.780> gonna

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
got a lot of planking to do I'm gonna

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.270 
got a lot of planking to do I'm gonna
have<00:03:25.170> these<00:03:25.500> supports<00:03:26.100> one<00:03:26.700> here<00:03:27.170> one<00:03:28.170> there

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
have these supports one here one there

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.880 
have these supports one here one there
one<00:03:29.280> there<00:03:29.310> more<00:03:29.940> more<00:03:30.450> so<00:03:30.690> to<00:03:31.620> give<00:03:31.799> me

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
one there more more so to give me

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.770 
one there more more so to give me
something<00:03:32.130> to<00:03:32.370> nail<00:03:32.579> the<00:03:32.730> boards<00:03:33.060> onto<00:03:33.269> and<00:03:33.720> to

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
something to nail the boards onto and to

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.090 
something to nail the boards onto and to
actually<00:03:36.109> then<00:03:37.109> fractional<00:03:37.650> support

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
actually then fractional support

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.500 
actually then fractional support
although<00:03:38.400> I<00:03:38.609> guess<00:03:38.880> they<00:03:39.030> do<00:03:39.090> help<00:03:39.359> for

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
although I guess they do help for

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.740 
although I guess they do help for
support<00:03:39.840> as<00:03:39.900> well<00:03:41.090> it<00:03:42.090> doesn't<00:03:42.420> seem<00:03:42.540> to<00:03:42.660> be

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
support as well it doesn't seem to be

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.020 
support as well it doesn't seem to be
flexing<00:03:43.230> much<00:03:43.380> at<00:03:43.530> all<00:03:43.680> it's<00:03:44.579> already<00:03:44.910> been

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
flexing much at all it's already been

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.990 
flexing much at all it's already been
snowed<00:03:45.329> on<00:03:45.359> not<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:45.930> heavy<00:03:46.109> snow<00:03:46.350> but<00:03:46.910> you<00:03:47.910> know

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
snowed on not a heavy snow but you know

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.349 
snowed on not a heavy snow but you know
if<00:03:48.209> this<00:03:49.019> front<00:03:49.380> beam<00:03:49.590> were<00:03:50.400> to<00:03:50.519> flex<00:03:50.790> down<00:03:51.090> we

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
if this front beam were to flex down we

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.840 
if this front beam were to flex down we
may<00:03:51.510> have<00:03:51.630> to<00:03:51.810> add<00:03:51.900> a<00:03:51.930> post<00:03:52.579> you<00:03:53.579> know<00:03:53.640> maybe

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
may have to add a post you know maybe

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.309 
may have to add a post you know maybe
make<00:03:54.060> it<00:03:54.090> removable<00:03:55.069> the<00:03:57.139> corners<00:03:58.139> would

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
make it removable the corners would

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.580 
make it removable the corners would
still<00:03:58.530> notice<00:03:58.799> that<00:03:58.920> it's<00:03:59.069> a<00:03:59.130> little<00:04:00.470> it's<00:04:01.470> got

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
still notice that it's a little it's got

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.470 
still notice that it's a little it's got
a<00:04:01.620> little<00:04:01.859> flex<00:04:02.130> to<00:04:02.340> it<00:04:02.459> so<00:04:02.609> it<00:04:02.730> might<00:04:02.910> do<00:04:03.209> some

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
a little flex to it so it might do some

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.199 
a little flex to it so it might do some
kind<00:04:03.750> of<00:04:03.810> triangulation<00:04:04.319> in<00:04:04.560> the<00:04:04.620> corners

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
kind of triangulation in the corners

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.149 
kind of triangulation in the corners
might<00:04:06.209> not<00:04:06.420> see<00:04:07.170> that<00:04:07.200> see<00:04:07.620> what<00:04:07.739> happens<00:04:08.069> with

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 
might not see that see what happens with

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:10.850 
might not see that see what happens with
that

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.740 

yeah<00:04:11.860> that's<00:04:12.100> that's<00:04:12.459> pretty<00:04:12.700> much<00:04:12.850> it<00:04:13.090> I'd

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
yeah that's that's pretty much it I'd

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.650 
yeah that's that's pretty much it I'd
been<00:04:13.959> asked<00:04:14.260> a<00:04:14.290> question<00:04:15.180> the<00:04:16.180> question<00:04:16.209> was

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
been asked a question the question was

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.050 
been asked a question the question was
why<00:04:17.470> wasn't<00:04:17.889> there<00:04:18.310> what<00:04:18.549> did<00:04:18.639> I<00:04:18.730> used<00:04:18.910> to

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
why wasn't there what did I used to

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.810 
why wasn't there what did I used to
anchor<00:04:19.209> the<00:04:19.450> shed<00:04:19.690> the<00:04:20.560> shed<00:04:20.769> is<00:04:21.040> not<00:04:21.430> anchored

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
anchor the shed the shed is not anchored

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.220 
anchor the shed the shed is not anchored
to<00:04:22.180> the<00:04:22.870> foundation<00:04:24.300> simply<00:04:25.300> because<00:04:25.630> I<00:04:25.900> don't

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
to the foundation simply because I don't

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.180 
to the foundation simply because I don't
feel<00:04:26.560> it's<00:04:26.680> necessary<00:04:28.530> the<00:04:29.530> sheds<00:04:29.770> got<00:04:29.950> away

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
feel it's necessary the sheds got away

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.150 
feel it's necessary the sheds got away
by<00:04:30.970> now<00:04:31.210> probably<00:04:31.960> close<00:04:32.500> to<00:04:32.530> a<00:04:32.770> thousand

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
by now probably close to a thousand

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.540 
by now probably close to a thousand
pounds<00:04:35.850> 800<00:04:36.850> to<00:04:37.330> a<00:04:37.360> thousand<00:04:37.780> pounds<00:04:37.900> each

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
pounds 800 to a thousand pounds each

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.550 
pounds 800 to a thousand pounds each
tractor<00:04:39.550> I<00:04:39.850> think<00:04:40.510> that<00:04:40.630> one<00:04:40.810> is<00:04:40.840> at<00:04:41.169> five

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
tractor I think that one is at five

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.130 
tractor I think that one is at five
something<00:04:42.070> and<00:04:43.000> I<00:04:43.060> think<00:04:43.120> the<00:04:43.390> other<00:04:43.630> Bolin's

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
something and I think the other Bolin's

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.980 
something and I think the other Bolin's
that's<00:04:44.350> going<00:04:44.620> in<00:04:44.740> there<00:04:44.919> is<00:04:45.070> around<00:04:45.990> well

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
that's going in there is around well

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.050 
that's going in there is around well
it's<00:04:47.110> over<00:04:47.260> six<00:04:47.590> hundred<00:04:47.620> pounds<00:04:48.190> so<00:04:48.760> that

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
it's over six hundred pounds so that

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.659 
it's over six hundred pounds so that
plus<00:04:49.660> mower<00:04:50.020> decks<00:04:50.350> plus<00:04:50.770> whatever<00:04:51.040> else<00:04:51.250> I

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
plus mower decks plus whatever else I

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.870 
plus mower decks plus whatever else I
end<00:04:52.360> up<00:04:52.480> putting<00:04:52.600> in<00:04:52.780> this<00:04:52.930> shed<00:04:53.169> is<00:04:53.410> I<00:04:53.880> believe

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
end up putting in this shed is I believe

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.490 
end up putting in this shed is I believe
enough<00:04:55.210> to<00:04:55.360> hold<00:04:55.480> it<00:04:55.630> down<00:04:55.780> under<00:04:56.110> any<00:04:56.230> wind

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
enough to hold it down under any wind

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.020 
enough to hold it down under any wind
circumstances<00:04:57.250> or<00:04:57.400> anything<00:04:57.430> like<00:04:57.790> that<00:04:57.850> that

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
circumstances or anything like that that

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.330 
circumstances or anything like that that
we<00:04:58.270> receive<00:04:58.840> around<00:04:59.080> here<00:04:59.380> my<00:05:00.130> biggest

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
we receive around here my biggest

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.040 
we receive around here my biggest
concern<00:05:00.760> is<00:05:00.940> the<00:05:02.250> is<00:05:03.250> the<00:05:03.940> foundation<00:05:04.570> with

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
concern is the is the foundation with

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.100 
concern is the is the foundation with
the<00:05:05.169> frost<00:05:05.440> heaving<00:05:05.950> up<00:05:06.190> and<00:05:07.180> becoming<00:05:07.570> uneven

to<00:05:20.229> date<00:05:20.440> we<00:05:20.680> probably<00:05:20.979> have<00:05:21.250> less<00:05:21.460> than<00:05:22.470> less

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
to date we probably have less than less

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:28.110 
to date we probably have less than less
than<00:05:23.550> $75<00:05:24.550> in<00:05:24.729> this<00:05:24.850> whole<00:05:25.030> shed<00:05:25.300> so<00:05:26.020> I<00:05:27.120> mean

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
was built with new materials but then

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.070 
was built with new materials but then
again<00:05:36.160> for<00:05:36.640> the<00:05:36.700> cost<00:05:37.270> I<00:05:37.570> mean<00:05:37.720> I<00:05:37.750> can't<00:05:38.020> really
