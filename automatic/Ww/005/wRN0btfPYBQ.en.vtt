00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
on the table anymore and you can just

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.859 
on the table anymore and you can just
blow<00:00:57.860> the<00:00:58.010> RC<00:00:58.280> car<00:00:58.309> up<00:00:58.640> whenever<00:00:58.879> and<00:00:59.210> then

00:00:59.859 --> 00:00:59.869 
blow the RC car up whenever and then

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:01.000 
blow the RC car up whenever and then
you're<00:01:00.140> outside<00:01:00.350> the<00:01:00.440> map<00:01:00.559> and<00:01:00.680> you<00:01:00.739> can<00:01:00.860> just

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
you're outside the map and you can just

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.250 
you're outside the map and you can just
stand<00:01:01.220> up<00:01:01.369> and<00:01:01.629> you<00:01:02.629> can<00:01:02.780> spin<00:01:02.989> around<00:01:03.019> and

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
stand up and you can spin around and

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.670 
stand up and you can spin around and
then<00:01:06.310> that's<00:01:07.310> what<00:01:07.430> you<00:01:07.580> look<00:01:07.729> like<00:01:08.439> on<00:01:09.439> that

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
then that's what you look like on that

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.630 
then that's what you look like on that
screen<00:01:09.829> and<00:01:10.509> then<00:01:11.509> on<00:01:11.780> the<00:01:12.590> other<00:01:12.770> people's

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
screen and then on the other people's

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.910 
screen and then on the other people's
screen<00:01:13.939> when<00:01:14.840> they<00:01:15.109> want<00:01:15.439> to<00:01:15.500> come<00:01:15.680> see<00:01:15.890> you

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
will be able to see them a little bit

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.560 
will be able to see them a little bit
but<00:01:19.310> you<00:01:19.670> can't<00:01:19.880> throw<00:01:20.030> anything<00:01:20.210> out<00:01:20.359> there

mean you can still shoot and get can get
killed<00:01:49.819> through<00:01:49.969> there<00:01:50.119> it's<00:01:50.990> pretty<00:01:51.200> much

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
killed through there it's pretty much

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.870 
killed through there it's pretty much
you<00:01:51.499> slide<00:01:51.890> back<00:01:52.189> and<00:01:52.219> forth<00:01:52.429> when<00:01:52.729> you're

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
you slide back and forth when you're

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.059 
you slide back and forth when you're
back<00:01:52.999> there<00:01:53.030> so<00:01:53.990> moving<00:01:54.350> around<00:01:54.619> is<00:01:54.770> kind<00:01:54.890> of

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:55.069 
back there so moving around is kind of

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:57.459 
back there so moving around is kind of
hard<00:01:55.189> but<00:01:55.429> you<00:01:55.670> don't<00:01:55.850> fall<00:01:55.999> through<00:01:56.380> but<00:01:57.380> you

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
hard but you don't fall through but you

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:00.830 
hard but you don't fall through but you
can<00:01:57.679> get<00:01:57.829> killed<00:01:58.069> and<00:01:59.030> it's<00:01:59.630> really<00:01:59.869> easy

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
can get killed and it's really easy

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.060 
can get killed and it's really easy
for<00:02:01.020> my<00:02:01.320> catch<00:02:01.500> on<00:02:01.679> to<00:02:01.710> myself<00:02:03.109> but<00:02:04.109> that's

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
for my catch on to myself but that's

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.669 
for my catch on to myself but that's
pretty<00:02:05.189> much<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.570> eunos<00:02:06.570> died<00:02:06.780> whatever<00:02:08.330> but

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
pretty much it eunos died whatever but

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.820 
pretty much it eunos died whatever but
that's<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:11.099> glitch<00:02:11.640> again<00:02:12.349> but<00:02:13.349> if<00:02:13.530> you<00:02:13.650> want

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
that's the glitch again but if you want

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.190 
that's the glitch again but if you want
to<00:02:13.950> see<00:02:14.250> it<00:02:14.400> again<00:02:14.550> I'll<00:02:15.330> fast<00:02:15.599> forward<00:02:15.720> it<00:02:16.050> if

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
to see it again I'll fast forward it if

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.740 
to see it again I'll fast forward it if
I<00:02:16.319> can<00:02:18.110> hold<00:02:19.110> on<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:19.349> second<00:02:19.799> there<00:02:20.160> we<00:02:20.310> go<00:02:20.750> you

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
I can hold on a second there we go you

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:29.289 
I can hold on a second there we go you
just<00:02:21.959> get<00:02:22.470> your<00:02:22.590> three<00:02:22.830> kills<00:02:24.530> there's<00:02:25.530> one

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.430 

since<00:02:30.299> I<00:02:30.360> have<00:02:30.510> you<00:02:30.569> got<00:02:30.690> that<00:02:30.720> killing<00:02:31.110> second

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
since I have you got that killing second

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.830 
since I have you got that killing second
chance<00:02:31.650> just<00:02:31.920> go<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.129> do<00:02:32.220> it<00:02:32.250> again<00:02:32.690> you<00:02:33.690> can

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
chance just go and do it again you can

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.319 
chance just go and do it again you can
also<00:02:34.110> dive<00:02:34.799> onto<00:02:35.099> it<00:02:35.340> sometimes<00:02:36.060> that<00:02:36.239> works

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
also dive onto it sometimes that works

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.150 
also dive onto it sometimes that works
easier<00:02:36.780> if<00:02:36.900> you<00:02:36.989> can<00:02:37.170> crouch<00:02:37.620> in<00:02:37.739> doing<00:02:37.980> just

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
easier if you can crouch in doing just

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.650 
easier if you can crouch in doing just
crawl<00:02:38.459> up<00:02:38.489> in<00:02:38.700> that<00:02:38.819> corner<00:02:39.000> as<00:02:39.269> much<00:02:39.480> as<00:02:39.599> you

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
crawl up in that corner as much as you

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.949 
crawl up in that corner as much as you
can<00:02:39.810> pull<00:02:40.170> your<00:02:40.200> RC<00:02:40.620> oh<00:02:41.540> and<00:02:42.540> then<00:02:42.690> you<00:02:42.720> notice

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
can pull your RC oh and then you notice

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.140 
can pull your RC oh and then you notice
that<00:02:43.079> you're<00:02:43.260> up<00:02:43.380> off<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.680> wall<00:02:43.860> and<00:02:44.670> then<00:02:45.120> you

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
that you're up off the wall and then you

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.420 
that you're up off the wall and then you
blow<00:02:45.360> it<00:02:45.480> up<00:02:45.569> and<00:02:45.860> then<00:02:46.860> you<00:02:46.950> just<00:02:47.099> stand<00:02:47.340> up

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
blow it up and then you just stand up

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.280 
blow it up and then you just stand up
and<00:02:47.640> you're<00:02:48.180> outside<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:48.510> mean<00:02:48.750> you<00:02:48.840> can<00:02:49.019> Crouch

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
and you're outside I mean you can Crouch

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.740 
and you're outside I mean you can Crouch
if<00:02:49.680> you<00:02:49.769> want<00:02:49.950> but<00:02:50.640> i<00:02:50.879> prefer<00:02:51.150> standing<00:02:51.540> just

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
if you want but i prefer standing just

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.880 
if you want but i prefer standing just
because<00:02:51.900> it's<00:02:52.049> easier<00:02:53.750> but<00:02:54.750> you<00:02:54.930> can<00:02:55.140> see<00:02:55.319> over

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
because it's easier but you can see over

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.729 
because it's easier but you can see over
there<00:02:56.040> all<00:02:56.310> that<00:02:56.340> stuff<00:02:56.870> it's<00:02:57.870> a<00:02:58.140> glitch<00:02:58.470> not<00:02:58.680> a

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
there all that stuff it's a glitch not a

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.880 
there all that stuff it's a glitch not a
lot<00:02:58.920> of<00:02:58.950> people<00:02:59.040> know<00:02:59.310> about<00:02:59.340> so<00:03:00.680> you<00:03:01.680> can<00:03:01.799> do

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
lot of people know about so you can do

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.100 
lot of people know about so you can do
it<00:03:01.980> on<00:03:02.069> certain<00:03:02.310> destroy<00:03:02.610> like<00:03:03.480> I<00:03:03.599> said<00:03:03.810> you

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
it on certain destroy like I said you

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.449 
it on certain destroy like I said you
can't<00:03:04.349> throw<00:03:04.500> your<00:03:04.530> stuff<00:03:04.769> in<00:03:04.829> the<00:03:05.010> tomahawk

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
can't throw your stuff in the tomahawk

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.800 
can't throw your stuff in the tomahawk
she's<00:03:05.670> okay<00:03:06.150> I<00:03:07.310> can't<00:03:08.310> pick<00:03:08.519> it<00:03:08.549> up<00:03:08.730> but<00:03:09.090> that's

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
she's okay I can't pick it up but that's

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.360 
she's okay I can't pick it up but that's
just<00:03:10.019> for<00:03:10.319> some<00:03:10.470> odd<00:03:10.620> reason<00:03:10.650> because<00:03:11.250> it's

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
just for some odd reason because it's

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.559 
just for some odd reason because it's
probably<00:03:11.579> outside<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:11.970> map<00:03:12.120> because<00:03:12.329> it's<00:03:12.480> a

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
probably outside the map because it's a

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.330 
probably outside the map because it's a
glitch<00:03:13.670> so<00:03:15.650> you<00:03:16.650> can<00:03:16.799> always<00:03:16.950> can't<00:03:17.250> the

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
glitch so you can always can't the

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.550 
glitch so you can always can't the
doorway<00:03:17.670> and<00:03:18.060> crouch<00:03:18.359> to<00:03:18.750> whatever<00:03:19.019> coming

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
doorway and crouch to whatever coming

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.920 
doorway and crouch to whatever coming
when<00:03:20.160> people<00:03:20.430> try<00:03:20.579> to<00:03:20.609> walk<00:03:20.849> in<00:03:21.060> you<00:03:21.630> kill<00:03:21.840> them

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
when people try to walk in you kill them

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.390 
when people try to walk in you kill them
they're<00:03:22.349> like<00:03:22.530> where<00:03:22.739> they<00:03:22.829> get<00:03:22.980> killed<00:03:23.190> from

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
they're like where they get killed from

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.660 
they're like where they get killed from
if<00:03:23.940> it's<00:03:24.090> hardcore<00:03:24.590> they're<00:03:25.590> like<00:03:25.799> what<00:03:26.549> the

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
if it's hardcore they're like what the

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.250 
if it's hardcore they're like what the
fuck<00:03:26.700> cuz<00:03:28.010> you're<00:03:29.010> no<00:03:29.579> kill<00:03:29.790> cams<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:30.299> then

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
fuck cuz you're no kill cams and then

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.140 
fuck cuz you're no kill cams and then
they're<00:03:31.470> like<00:03:31.620> hmm<00:03:32.040> because<00:03:32.549> you<00:03:32.669> can<00:03:32.700> see<00:03:33.000> on

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
they're like hmm because you can see on

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.300 
they're like hmm because you can see on
the<00:03:33.269> other<00:03:33.389> screen<00:03:33.569> there<00:03:34.470> right<00:03:34.620> there<00:03:34.829> and

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
the other screen there right there and

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.490 
the other screen there right there and
then<00:03:36.150> you<00:03:36.299> just<00:03:36.419> easily<00:03:36.720> get<00:03:36.900> killed<00:03:37.079> hardcore

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
then you just easily get killed hardcore

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.559 
then you just easily get killed hardcore
search<00:03:38.030> easy<00:03:40.579> but<00:03:41.579> that's<00:03:41.910> about<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.359> glitch

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
search easy but that's about the glitch

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.170 
search easy but that's about the glitch
