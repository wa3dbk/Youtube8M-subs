hey<00:00:00.570> guys<00:00:00.750> and<00:00:00.960> welcome<00:00:00.989> to<00:00:01.290> the<00:00:01.380> tinker<00:00:01.620> box

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
hey guys and welcome to the tinker box

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:09.669 
hey guys and welcome to the tinker box
and<00:00:02.100> today<00:00:02.850> I<00:00:03.770> have<00:00:04.770> for<00:00:05.250> you<00:00:05.609> a<00:00:06.799> 1<00:00:07.799> wide

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:09.679 
and today I have for you a 1 wide

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:13.759 
and today I have for you a 1 wide
sorting<00:00:10.679> mechanism<00:00:12.170> that<00:00:13.170> is<00:00:13.320> what<00:00:13.440> this<00:00:13.559> is

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
sorting mechanism that is what this is

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.799 
sorting mechanism that is what this is
is<00:00:13.980> one<00:00:14.340> wide<00:00:14.519> sorting<00:00:14.940> mechanism<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.660> I

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
is one wide sorting mechanism and I

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.580 
is one wide sorting mechanism and I
think<00:00:16.260> it<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.770> darn<00:00:17.100> flipping<00:00:18.029> beautiful<00:00:18.720> just

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
think it is darn flipping beautiful just

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.700 
think it is darn flipping beautiful just
look<00:00:19.800> at<00:00:19.920> it<00:00:20.660> so<00:00:21.660> basically<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.260> way<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:22.500> works

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
look at it so basically the way it works

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.939 
look at it so basically the way it works
is<00:00:23.750> mm-hmm<00:00:24.750> before<00:00:25.350> I<00:00:25.380> show<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:25.650> how<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.800> build

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
is mm-hmm before I show you how to build

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:26.990 
is mm-hmm before I show you how to build
it<00:00:26.130> I'll<00:00:26.250> just<00:00:26.400> kind<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.609> explain<00:00:26.910> the

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
it I'll just kind of explain the

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.620 
it I'll just kind of explain the
concepts<00:00:27.480> behind<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:28.820> there<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:30.150> an<00:00:30.330> item

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
concepts behind it there is an item

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.819 
concepts behind it there is an item
hopper<00:00:31.019> which<00:00:31.710> is<00:00:31.859> set<00:00:32.009> up<00:00:32.130> with<00:00:32.160> 18<00:00:32.969> items

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
hopper which is set up with 18 items

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.490 
hopper which is set up with 18 items
three<00:00:34.829> items<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.550> then<00:00:35.579> one<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:37.050> item

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
three items and then one of the item

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.209 
three items and then one of the item
that<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:37.890> want<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.610> sort<00:00:39.739> that<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.950> hooked<00:00:41.129> up

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
that you want to sort that is hooked up

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.840 
that you want to sort that is hooked up
to<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.430> comparator<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.739> then<00:00:43.739> two<00:00:44.280> pieces<00:00:44.820> of

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
to a comparator and then two pieces of

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.350 
to a comparator and then two pieces of
redstone<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.950> the<00:00:46.950> way<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.280> works<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.850> if

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
redstone and the way this works is if

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.750 
redstone and the way this works is if
you<00:00:48.840> get<00:00:49.110> one<00:00:49.890> extra<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:51.829> these<00:00:52.829> iron<00:00:53.280> ingots

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
you get one extra of these iron ingots

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.850 
you get one extra of these iron ingots
or<00:00:53.850> whatever<00:00:54.120> you're<00:00:54.329> sorting<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:55.379> second

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
or whatever you're sorting the second

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.950 
or whatever you're sorting the second
piece<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.070> redstone<00:00:56.430> will<00:00:56.850> light<00:00:57.030> up<00:00:57.239> turn<00:00:57.750> off

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
piece of redstone will light up turn off

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.290 
piece of redstone will light up turn off
this<00:00:58.199> torch<00:00:58.620> which<00:00:59.070> retracts<00:00:59.520> this<00:00:59.789> piston

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
this torch which retracts this piston

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.540 
this torch which retracts this piston
and<00:01:00.420> redstone<00:01:00.750> block<00:01:01.140> which<00:01:01.859> turns<00:01:02.160> on<00:01:02.340> this

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
and redstone block which turns on this

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.170 
and redstone block which turns on this
clock<00:01:03.350> which<00:01:04.350> has<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:04.860> dropper<00:01:05.460> start

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
clock which has this dropper start

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.149 
clock which has this dropper start
activating<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.500> dropper<00:01:07.799> will<00:01:07.920> start

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
activating and the dropper will start

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.920 
activating and the dropper will start
putting<00:01:08.430> items<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:08.820> this<00:01:08.939> chest<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.720> every

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
putting items in this chest and every

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.420 
putting items in this chest and every
time<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.170> dropper<00:01:10.560> puts<00:01:10.740> one<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.070> items<00:01:11.159> in

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
time a dropper puts one of the items in

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.070 
time a dropper puts one of the items in
the<00:01:11.490> chest<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:12.060> will<00:01:12.180> pull<00:01:12.420> one<00:01:12.659> out<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.869> the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
the chest it will pull one out of the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.200 
the chest it will pull one out of the
hopper<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.670> eventually<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.790> hopper<00:01:15.060> will

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
hopper and eventually the hopper will

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.820 
hopper and eventually the hopper will
get<00:01:15.360> back<00:01:15.509> down<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.810> just<00:01:16.080> one<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.560> whatever

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
get back down to just one of whatever

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.920 
get back down to just one of whatever
item<00:01:17.100> you're<00:01:17.189> trying<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.759> sort<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.540> piston

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
item you're trying to sort this piston

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.960 
item you're trying to sort this piston
will<00:01:19.170> retract<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.890> this<00:01:20.250> clock<00:01:20.549> will<00:01:20.759> turn

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
will retract and this clock will turn

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.230 
will retract and this clock will turn
off<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:22.049> it's<00:01:22.979> pretty<00:01:23.280> simple<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:23.909> uses<00:01:24.060> a

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
off so it's pretty simple and it uses a

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.850 
off so it's pretty simple and it uses a
lot<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.810> new<00:01:25.080> things<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.619> have<00:01:25.830> been

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
lot of the new things that have been

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.380 
lot of the new things that have been
added<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.430> game<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.759> make<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.030> super

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
added to the game to make it super

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.069 
added to the game to make it super
simple<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.960> super<00:01:28.049> easy<00:01:29.570> ok<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.810> can<00:01:30.869> see

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
simple and super easy ok so you can see

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.100 
simple and super easy ok so you can see
after<00:01:31.200> in<00:01:31.380> some<00:01:31.560> basic<00:01:31.890> setup<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.400> have<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.630> chest

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
after in some basic setup I have a chest

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.819 
after in some basic setup I have a chest
a<00:01:34.530> dropper<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.549> then<00:01:36.210> an<00:01:36.299> item<00:01:36.630> hopper<00:01:37.049> so

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
a dropper and then an item hopper so

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.230 
a dropper and then an item hopper so
let's<00:01:38.070> just<00:01:38.220> get<00:01:38.369> things<00:01:38.610> set<00:01:38.790> up<00:01:38.820> down<00:01:39.090> the

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
let's just get things set up down the

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.060 
let's just get things set up down the
line<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.990> first<00:01:40.229> thing<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.439> have<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.619> do<00:01:40.829> is

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
line the first thing you have to do is

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.149 
line the first thing you have to do is
you<00:01:41.189> have<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.549> fill<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:41.970> chest<00:01:42.649> with<00:01:43.649> one<00:01:44.009> of

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
you have to fill this chest with one of

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.450 
you have to fill this chest with one of
every<00:01:44.460> item<00:01:45.049> so<00:01:46.049> there<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.229> go<00:01:46.380> every<00:01:47.220> slot

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
every item so there you go every slot

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.840 
every item so there you go every slot
has<00:01:47.670> one<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.180> item<00:01:49.159> next<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.399> have<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.579> put

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
has one of the item next you have to put

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.600 
has one of the item next you have to put
a<00:01:51.000> minimum<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.869> one<00:01:52.320> stack<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.040> item<00:01:53.280> in

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
a minimum of one stack of that item in

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.719 
a minimum of one stack of that item in
the<00:01:54.390> dropper<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.100> then<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.189> just<00:01:56.399> fill<00:01:56.610> all

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
the dropper and then you just fill all

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.670 
the dropper and then you just fill all
the<00:01:56.880> extra<00:01:57.149> slots<00:01:57.420> with<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.689> random<00:01:58.110> item<00:01:58.469> that

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
the extra slots with a random item that

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.010 
the extra slots with a random item that
can't<00:01:58.950> be<00:01:59.070> put<00:01:59.280> into<00:01:59.399> this<00:01:59.640> chest<00:02:00.060> now

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
can't be put into this chest now

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.429 
can't be put into this chest now
alternatively<00:02:02.210> you<00:02:03.210> could<00:02:03.509> fill<00:02:03.780> each<00:02:03.990> one<00:02:04.290> of

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
alternatively you could fill each one of

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.749 
alternatively you could fill each one of
if<00:02:04.560> you're<00:02:04.799> doing<00:02:04.979> something<00:02:05.130> like<00:02:05.310> Kabul

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
if you're doing something like Kabul

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.130 
if you're doing something like Kabul
where<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:05.939> have<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.090> ton<00:02:06.329> of<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:07.020> could

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
where you have a ton of it you could

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.169 
where you have a ton of it you could
just<00:02:07.320> fill<00:02:07.649> instead<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.280> pressure<00:02:08.729> plates<00:02:09.030> you

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
just fill instead of pressure plates you

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.059 
just fill instead of pressure plates you
can<00:02:09.300> have<00:02:09.450> each<00:02:09.660> one<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:09.959> these<00:02:10.229> be<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.679> stack<00:02:11.039> of

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
can have each one of these be a stack of

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.190 
can have each one of these be a stack of
Kabul<00:02:11.760> which<00:02:12.330> will<00:02:12.510> make<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.720> whole<00:02:12.870> sorting

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
Kabul which will make the whole sorting

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.850 
Kabul which will make the whole sorting
system<00:02:13.530> go

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
system go

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.530 
system go
aster<00:02:14.190> but<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.460> does<00:02:14.640> make<00:02:14.910> it<00:02:15.090> more<00:02:15.120> expensive

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
aster but it does make it more expensive

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.750 
aster but it does make it more expensive
so<00:02:16.440> I<00:02:16.470> just<00:02:16.740> like<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:16.980> do<00:02:17.070> it<00:02:17.190> this<00:02:17.310> way<00:02:17.550> for

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
so I just like to do it this way for

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.740 
so I just like to do it this way for
things<00:02:17.940> like<00:02:18.030> iron<00:02:18.860> where<00:02:19.860> I<00:02:20.460> and<00:02:21.450> in<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.630> end

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
things like iron where I and in the end

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.140 
things like iron where I and in the end
it's<00:02:21.840> going<00:02:22.020> to<00:02:22.110> be<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.230> lot<00:02:22.470> cheaper<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:23.100> do<00:02:23.460> you

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
it's going to be a lot cheaper to do you

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.220 
it's going to be a lot cheaper to do you
definitely<00:02:24.540> probably<00:02:24.690> wouldn't<00:02:25.050> whom

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
definitely probably wouldn't whom

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.720 
definitely probably wouldn't whom
something<00:02:25.560> like<00:02:25.710> this<00:02:25.860> for<00:02:26.040> diamond<00:02:26.490> unless

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
something like this for diamond unless

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.200 
something like this for diamond unless
you<00:02:26.850> just<00:02:27.030> had<00:02:27.240> a<00:02:27.540> stack<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:28.920> a<00:02:29.760> half<00:02:29.970> or<00:02:30.180> so

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
you just had a stack and a half or so

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.140 
you just had a stack and a half or so
extra<00:02:31.250> okay<00:02:32.250> so<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.520> next<00:02:32.550> thing<00:02:32.790> you<00:02:33.030> knew

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
extra okay so the next thing you knew

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.970 
extra okay so the next thing you knew
need<00:02:33.630> to<00:02:33.750> do<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:33.990> get<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.200> item<00:02:34.440> hopper<00:02:34.680> set<00:02:34.860> up

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
need to do to get the item hopper set up

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:42.250 
need to do to get the item hopper set up
is<00:02:35.130> you<00:02:35.190> need<00:02:35.340> to<00:02:35.400> put<00:02:36.500> oh<00:02:38.210> that's<00:02:39.210> right<00:02:39.420> ok<00:02:40.550> so

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
is you need to put oh that's right ok so

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.440 
is you need to put oh that's right ok so
the<00:02:43.260> extra<00:02:43.709> item<00:02:44.070> in<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.640> dropper<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.150> the

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
the extra item in the dropper and the

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.270 
the extra item in the dropper and the
extra<00:02:45.750> item<00:02:46.050> in<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.260> hopper<00:02:46.620> can't<00:02:46.950> be<00:02:47.100> the

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
extra item in the hopper can't be the

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.930 
extra item in the hopper can't be the
same<00:02:47.780> so<00:02:48.780> I<00:02:48.810> used<00:02:49.290> stone<00:02:49.890> pressure<00:02:50.160> plates<00:02:50.580> and

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
same so I used stone pressure plates and

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.699 
same so I used stone pressure plates and
the<00:02:51.090> dropper<00:02:51.510> is<00:02:51.570> my<00:02:51.750> ex<00:02:51.900> tried<00:02:52.050> I'm<00:02:52.350> Samba

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
the dropper is my ex tried I'm Samba

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.500 
the dropper is my ex tried I'm Samba
hopper<00:02:53.100> I'll<00:02:53.250> use<00:02:53.459> wooden<00:02:53.730> pressure<00:02:54.090> plates

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
hopper I'll use wooden pressure plates

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.130 
hopper I'll use wooden pressure plates
and<00:02:54.870> so<00:02:55.860> you<00:02:55.920> need<00:02:56.280> one<00:02:56.459> two<00:02:56.880> three<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:57.690> then<00:02:57.959> 1

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
and so you need one two three and then 1

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.540 
and so you need one two three and then 1
2<00:02:58.350> 3<00:02:58.380> 4<00:02:58.739> 5<00:02:59.250> 6<00:02:59.520> 7<00:02:59.790> 8<00:03:00.090> 9<00:03:00.150> 10<00:03:00.390> 11<00:03:00.690> 12<00:03:01.230> 13<00:03:01.320> 14<00:03:01.709> 15<00:03:02.010> 16<00:03:02.310> 17

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.750 
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17
18<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:03.390> then<00:03:04.290> one<00:03:04.980> of<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.220> item<00:03:05.550> you<00:03:05.670> were

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
18 and then one of the item you were

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.790 
18 and then one of the item you were
wanting<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.120> sort<00:03:08.180> now<00:03:09.180> behind<00:03:09.510> this<00:03:09.840> you<00:03:10.440> need

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
wanting to sort now behind this you need

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.820 
wanting to sort now behind this you need
a<00:03:11.160> comparator<00:03:12.030> and<00:03:14.150> that<00:03:15.150> compare<00:03:15.600> rater<00:03:15.870> will

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
a comparator and that compare rater will

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.699 
a comparator and that compare rater will
just<00:03:17.130> go<00:03:17.250> out<00:03:17.400> one<00:03:17.700> block<00:03:18.000> right<00:03:18.299> now<00:03:18.709> but

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
just go out one block right now but

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.080 
just go out one block right now but
you'll<00:03:19.830> see<00:03:20.010> as<00:03:20.130> soon<00:03:20.280> as<00:03:20.400> I<00:03:20.519> add<00:03:20.640> one<00:03:20.670> extra

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
you'll see as soon as I add one extra

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.720 
you'll see as soon as I add one extra
piece<00:03:21.360> of<00:03:21.510> iron<00:03:21.830> then<00:03:22.830> goes<00:03:23.010> out<00:03:23.130> two<00:03:23.400> blocks

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
piece of iron then goes out two blocks

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.690 
piece of iron then goes out two blocks
instead<00:03:24.769> so<00:03:25.769> that's<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:26.040> whole<00:03:26.130> principle

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
instead so that's the whole principle

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.850 
instead so that's the whole principle
the<00:03:26.910> system<00:03:27.269> works<00:03:27.480> on<00:03:27.690> then<00:03:28.470> you're<00:03:28.590> going<00:03:28.739> to

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
the system works on then you're going to

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.320 
the system works on then you're going to
need<00:03:29.040> a<00:03:29.070> torch<00:03:29.400> to<00:03:29.430> invert<00:03:29.880> the<00:03:30.030> signal<00:03:30.450> a

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
need a torch to invert the signal a

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.970 
need a torch to invert the signal a
piston<00:03:33.330> and<00:03:34.100> a<00:03:35.100> redstone<00:03:35.400> block<00:03:35.820> there<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.269> go

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
piston and a redstone block there you go

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.250 
piston and a redstone block there you go
ok<00:03:37.980> then<00:03:38.670> underneath<00:03:39.060> this<00:03:39.630> dropper<00:03:40.140> we're

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
ok then underneath this dropper we're

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.720 
ok then underneath this dropper we're
going<00:03:40.410> to<00:03:40.470> start<00:03:40.620> building<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.070> clock<00:03:41.310> so

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
going to start building the clock so

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.870 
going to start building the clock so
first<00:03:43.010> okay<00:03:44.010> we're<00:03:44.160> going<00:03:44.280> to<00:03:44.370> put<00:03:44.430> a<00:03:44.489> torch

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
first okay we're going to put a torch

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.240 
first okay we're going to put a torch
and<00:03:46.220> okay<00:03:47.220> it<00:03:47.370> it's<00:03:47.790> still<00:03:48.000> at<00:03:48.120> 64<00:03:48.720> and<00:03:49.250> then

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
and okay it it's still at 64 and then

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.259 
and okay it it's still at 64 and then
next<00:03:50.400> we're<00:03:50.610> just<00:03:50.730> going<00:03:50.880> to<00:03:50.940> build<00:03:51.150> this

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
next we're just going to build this

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.560 
next we're just going to build this
little<00:03:52.340> little<00:03:53.340> vertical<00:03:53.640> clock<00:03:54.120> you<00:03:54.360> see

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
little little vertical clock you see

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:01.490 
little little vertical clock you see
over<00:03:54.810> there<00:03:54.840> it's<00:03:56.360> pretty<00:03:57.360> simple<00:04:00.110> so<00:04:01.110> you<00:04:01.170> put

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
over there it's pretty simple so you put

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.789 
over there it's pretty simple so you put
this<00:04:01.620> down<00:04:01.830> set<00:04:02.250> it<00:04:02.340> to<00:04:02.489> the<00:04:02.519> second<00:04:02.970> tick<00:04:03.799> have

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
this down set it to the second tick have

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.380 
this down set it to the second tick have
it<00:04:04.920> go<00:04:05.010> into<00:04:05.040> a<00:04:05.250> block<00:04:05.489> that<00:04:05.670> has<00:04:05.790> a<00:04:05.850> torch<00:04:06.180> on

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
it go into a block that has a torch on

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:12.770 
it go into a block that has a torch on
it<00:04:06.980> and<00:04:08.630> then<00:04:09.630> you<00:04:10.140> feed<00:04:10.739> some<00:04:11.549> a<00:04:11.880> headstone

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
it and then you feed some a headstone

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.069 
it and then you feed some a headstone
along<00:04:13.110> it<00:04:13.320> and<00:04:13.410> your<00:04:13.980> clock<00:04:14.220> is<00:04:14.250> going<00:04:14.489> and

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
along it and your clock is going and

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:18.979 
along it and your clock is going and
then<00:04:16.079> you<00:04:16.470> have<00:04:16.739> oops<00:04:17.220> you<00:04:18.209> have<00:04:18.419> this<00:04:18.630> run

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
then you have oops you have this run

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.730 
then you have oops you have this run
over<00:04:19.620> oh<00:04:20.690> my<00:04:21.690> goodness<00:04:21.780> there<00:04:22.080> we<00:04:22.200> go<00:04:22.260> you<00:04:22.620> have

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
over oh my goodness there we go you have

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.880 
over oh my goodness there we go you have
this<00:04:22.890> run<00:04:23.099> over<00:04:23.340> to<00:04:23.940> the<00:04:24.210> redstone<00:04:25.200> block<00:04:25.530> and

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
this run over to the redstone block and

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.560 
this run over to the redstone block and
you<00:04:26.610> connect<00:04:26.910> it<00:04:27.000> up<00:04:27.120> so

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
you connect it up so

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:28.970 
you connect it up so
that<00:04:27.660> way<00:04:27.810> when<00:04:28.020> that<00:04:28.140> redstone<00:04:28.500> block<00:04:28.830> is

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
that way when that redstone block is

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.340 
that way when that redstone block is
extended<00:04:29.640> the<00:04:30.120> clock<00:04:30.360> won't<00:04:30.600> activate<00:04:31.050> and

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
extended the clock won't activate and

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.570 
extended the clock won't activate and
then<00:04:31.740> finally<00:04:32.040> you<00:04:32.070> just<00:04:32.220> put<00:04:32.340> a<00:04:32.370> piece<00:04:32.550> of

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
then finally you just put a piece of

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.090 
then finally you just put a piece of
redstone<00:04:32.820> up<00:04:33.090> here<00:04:33.360> and<00:04:33.540> that<00:04:34.530> will<00:04:34.710> start

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
redstone up here and that will start

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.970 
redstone up here and that will start
spinning<00:04:35.580> this<00:04:35.940> around<00:04:36.300> so<00:04:36.800> that's<00:04:37.800> basically

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
spinning this around so that's basically

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.680 
spinning this around so that's basically
it<00:04:38.310> that<00:04:38.640> is<00:04:38.790> how<00:04:38.910> you<00:04:38.940> build<00:04:39.270> the<00:04:39.360> sorting

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
it that is how you build the sorting

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.130 
it that is how you build the sorting
unit<00:04:40.020> and<00:04:40.730> if<00:04:41.730> you<00:04:41.820> just<00:04:41.970> throw<00:04:42.450> some<00:04:42.690> iron<00:04:42.960> and

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
unit and if you just throw some iron and

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.440 
unit and if you just throw some iron and
there<00:04:43.670> you<00:04:44.670> can<00:04:44.820> see<00:04:44.850> it<00:04:45.030> will<00:04:45.120> start<00:04:45.330> getting

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
there you can see it will start getting

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.260 
there you can see it will start getting
sorted<00:04:45.990> now<00:04:46.140> the<00:04:47.070> reason<00:04:47.220> I<00:04:47.490> said<00:04:47.730> filling

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
sorted now the reason I said filling

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.210 
sorted now the reason I said filling
this<00:04:48.330> up<00:04:48.390> with<00:04:48.840> all<00:04:49.080> stacks<00:04:49.380> of<00:04:49.560> iron<00:04:49.740> would<00:04:50.070> go

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
this up with all stacks of iron would go

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.410 
this up with all stacks of iron would go
faster<00:04:50.490> is<00:04:51.290> because<00:04:52.290> you'll<00:04:52.830> see<00:04:53.130> that<00:04:53.940> it

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
faster is because you'll see that it

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.360 
faster is because you'll see that it
doesn't<00:04:54.690> always<00:04:55.050> send<00:04:55.470> a<00:04:55.620> piece<00:04:55.800> of<00:04:55.830> iron<00:04:56.130> to

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
doesn't always send a piece of iron to

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.830 
doesn't always send a piece of iron to
the<00:04:56.490> chest<00:04:56.730> sometimes<00:04:57.180> it<00:04:57.300> will<00:04:57.390> try<00:04:57.570> to<00:04:57.630> send

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
the chest sometimes it will try to send

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.200 
the chest sometimes it will try to send
a<00:04:57.930> pressure<00:04:58.200> plate<00:04:58.500> into<00:04:58.800> the<00:04:59.070> chest<00:04:59.340> and<00:05:00.090> of

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
a pressure plate into the chest and of

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.370 
a pressure plate into the chest and of
course<00:05:00.420> when<00:05:00.540> it<00:05:00.630> tries<00:05:00.810> to<00:05:00.840> send<00:05:01.080> a<00:05:01.140> pressure

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
course when it tries to send a pressure

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.320 
course when it tries to send a pressure
plate<00:05:01.590> it's<00:05:02.430> not<00:05:02.460> going<00:05:02.580> to<00:05:02.790> be<00:05:02.850> able<00:05:02.880> to<00:05:03.090> send

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
plate it's not going to be able to send

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.000 
plate it's not going to be able to send
it<00:05:03.450> because<00:05:03.780> the<00:05:04.110> chest<00:05:04.380> has<00:05:04.560> no<00:05:04.680> inventory

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
it because the chest has no inventory

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.340 
it because the chest has no inventory
slots<00:05:05.490> for<00:05:05.700> pressure<00:05:05.940> plates<00:05:06.300> so<00:05:07.140> if<00:05:07.230> you're

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
slots for pressure plates so if you're

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:08.690 
slots for pressure plates so if you're
building<00:05:07.500> a<00:05:07.680> sorting<00:05:07.980> system<00:05:08.340> and<00:05:08.490> you<00:05:08.550> can

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
building a sorting system and you can

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.610 
building a sorting system and you can
afford<00:05:09.180> to<00:05:09.360> have<00:05:09.570> every<00:05:09.900> single<00:05:10.230> one<00:05:10.380> of<00:05:10.410> these

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
afford to have every single one of these

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.070 
afford to have every single one of these
dropper<00:05:11.130> slots<00:05:11.400> filled<00:05:11.850> with<00:05:12.420> the<00:05:12.780> item

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
dropper slots filled with the item

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.540 
dropper slots filled with the item
you're<00:05:13.200> trying<00:05:13.500> to<00:05:13.650> sort<00:05:13.920> instead<00:05:14.340> of<00:05:14.460> an

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
you're trying to sort instead of an

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.720 
you're trying to sort instead of an
extra<00:05:14.910> item<00:05:15.210> the<00:05:16.020> system<00:05:16.500> in<00:05:16.680> general<00:05:16.740> will<00:05:17.460> go

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:17.730 
extra item the system in general will go

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.090 
extra item the system in general will go
a<00:05:17.970> lot<00:05:18.390> faster<00:05:18.780> but<00:05:19.620> of<00:05:19.710> course<00:05:19.890> if<00:05:20.040> you're

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
a lot faster but of course if you're

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.290 
a lot faster but of course if you're
doing<00:05:20.280> something<00:05:20.550> like<00:05:20.670> iron<00:05:21.030> where<00:05:21.210> you

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
doing something like iron where you

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.380 
doing something like iron where you
don't<00:05:21.390> want<00:05:21.570> to<00:05:21.630> be<00:05:21.690> wasting<00:05:22.140> a<00:05:22.230> bunch<00:05:22.320> of<00:05:22.500> it

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 
don't want to be wasting a bunch of it

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.460 
don't want to be wasting a bunch of it
doing<00:05:24.390> one<00:05:24.540> item<00:05:24.810> in<00:05:24.900> the<00:05:25.020> corner<00:05:25.320> with<00:05:25.440> a

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
doing one item in the corner with a

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.170 
doing one item in the corner with a
bunch<00:05:25.680> of<00:05:25.740> extra<00:05:26.070> items<00:05:26.370> will<00:05:26.640> do<00:05:26.760> just<00:05:27.090> fine

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
bunch of extra items will do just fine

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.290 
bunch of extra items will do just fine
it<00:05:27.660> will<00:05:27.840> just<00:05:28.050> take<00:05:28.140> a<00:05:28.500> little<00:05:28.980> bit<00:05:29.190> longer<00:05:29.430> to

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
it will just take a little bit longer to

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.350 
it will just take a little bit longer to
actually<00:05:30.660> sort<00:05:30.900> all<00:05:31.050> the<00:05:31.170> items<00:05:31.640> so<00:05:32.640> that's<00:05:33.060> it

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
actually sort all the items so that's it

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.420 
actually sort all the items so that's it
for<00:05:33.390> how<00:05:33.690> to<00:05:33.750> build<00:05:33.990> this<00:05:34.110> one<00:05:34.470> wide<00:05:34.770> sorting
