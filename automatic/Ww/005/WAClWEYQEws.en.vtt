00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:11.880
 hello friends today we are going to make a braid 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.120
 French thiago the inverted plus a bun 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.880
 very easy so let's start let's 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.400
 take a portion of hair on the side 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.500
 guiding us above our ears 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.529
 gay has to stay up and we're going 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.349
 to divide into three mentions and we begin 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.099
 to think in an inverted way that is to say 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.809
 that your right you're going to pass through 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.239
 and this left in the middle but 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.370
 we will always do it below that to the 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.370
 second round let's start 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.930
 feeding from both sides this consists 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.149
 to be very careful and that the 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.129
 fighters do not just let us go and there 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.489
 we are thinking and as you can see I'm going 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.350
 taking the hair that is more stuck 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.449
 to the million that I am going to feed so that 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.840
 this braid is as pretty as possible 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.030
 what does not fit you perfect does not happen 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.820
 nothing for it exists the spray and 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.470
 pins are usually not being seen 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.120
 one in the mirror when you make three 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.900
 appointment but you can 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.760
 a little and take a mirror and look at you 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.010
 behind another mirror so that you go 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.860
 making your prey take the 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.090
 correct address here and so we go 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.090
 until we finish 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.710
 ah 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.160
 when you're almost on the other side 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.140
 that is the change of hands and they are still 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.650
 being inverted all 13 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.650
 complete 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:53.340
 You can leave alone this worthy little braid and 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:56.710
 tear it to make it look more more 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.869
 soon appointment or more messi style 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.049
 but you can also make a nice 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.049
 monkey 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.720
 If you have long hair, you should do it 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.580
 little by little and spinning around him 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.580
 you go around applying pins 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.520
 and it's going to look pretty nice 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.740
