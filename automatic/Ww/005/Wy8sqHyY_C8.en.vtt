pretty bad sunburn and the best one I

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.729 
pretty bad sunburn and the best one I
think<00:00:50.820> for<00:00:51.030> Sundberg<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.050> catastrophe

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
think for Sundberg is a catastrophe

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.240 
think for Sundberg is a catastrophe
cosmetic<00:00:53.550> faceoffs<00:00:54.270> are<00:00:54.570> really<00:00:54.930> great<00:00:55.260> for

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
cosmetic faceoffs are really great for

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.680 
cosmetic faceoffs are really great for
sunrooms<00:00:56.760> because<00:00:57.059> they're<00:00:57.210> really<00:00:57.449> cool

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
sunrooms because they're really cool

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.510 
sunrooms because they're really cool
because<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.170> keep<00:00:58.350> them<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.739> fridge<00:00:58.770> they

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
because you keep them in the fridge they

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.510 
because you keep them in the fridge they
just<00:00:59.699> feel<00:00:59.879> really<00:01:00.149> nice<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:01.160> yeah<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.190> have<00:01:02.460> a
