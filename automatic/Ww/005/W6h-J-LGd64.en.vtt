 health does not need to pedal 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.140
 both we end up not trying 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.789
 both do not have so much wear and tear if you 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.340

 into the wall socket so that the 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.219
 bike takes a 20-minute course 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.329
 kilometers when the loads are 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.220
 start the pedals 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.350

 buy a motorcycle a vehicle through 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.189
 have chosen this vein that 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.380
 the alternative haiku
