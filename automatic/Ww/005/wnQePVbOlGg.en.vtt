I<00:00:53.390> hold<00:00:53.899> it<00:00:54.020> like<00:00:54.500> this<00:00:54.530> so<00:00:55.520> when<00:00:56.000> you're

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
I hold it like this so when you're

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.299 
I hold it like this so when you're
riding<00:00:56.449> just<00:00:56.809> switch<00:00:57.350> into<00:00:57.649> that<00:00:57.800> riding

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
riding just switch into that riding

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:06.630 
riding just switch into that riding
switch<00:00:59.000> bar<00:00:59.539> spin<00:01:01.329> and<00:01:02.329> then<00:01:04.900> here's<00:01:05.900> how<00:01:06.140> you

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
switch bar spin and then here's how you

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.320 
switch bar spin and then here's how you
do<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:08.450> spin<00:01:08.930> so<00:01:09.320> for<00:01:09.619> the<00:01:09.770> finish<00:01:10.610> man<00:01:10.820> you

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
do the spin so for the finish man you

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.580 
do the spin so for the finish man you
come<00:01:11.509> up<00:01:12.009> jump<00:01:13.009> just<00:01:13.640> an<00:01:13.970> average<00:01:14.630> jump<00:01:14.960> I<00:01:15.200> mean

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
come up jump just an average jump I mean

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.850 
come up jump just an average jump I mean
doubt<00:01:15.939> wasn't<00:01:16.939> a<00:01:17.090> good<00:01:17.390> job<00:01:17.630> it<00:01:18.259> just<00:01:18.710> has

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
doubt wasn't a good job it just has

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.289 
doubt wasn't a good job it just has
doesn't<00:01:19.250> have<00:01:19.369> to<00:01:19.490> be<00:01:19.580> good<00:01:19.759> to<00:01:19.909> have<00:01:20.090> to<00:01:20.180> be<00:01:20.270> a

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
doesn't have to be good to have to be a

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.010 
doesn't have to be good to have to be a
small<00:01:20.600> one<00:01:20.890> tiny<00:01:21.890> jump<00:01:22.220> it's<00:01:22.610> like<00:01:22.790> that<00:01:23.750> big

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
small one tiny jump it's like that big

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.390 
small one tiny jump it's like that big
even<00:01:24.740> sometimes<00:01:25.329> depends<00:01:26.329> if<00:01:26.900> you're<00:01:27.400> just

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
even sometimes depends if you're just

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.370 
even sometimes depends if you're just
started<00:01:28.790> by<00:01:29.240> spins<00:01:29.600> maybe<00:01:29.960> jump<00:01:30.290> a<00:01:30.320> little

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
started by spins maybe jump a little

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.830 
started by spins maybe jump a little
higher<00:01:30.530> so<00:01:30.829> you<00:01:30.890> have<00:01:31.040> more<00:01:31.490> time<00:01:31.549> to<00:01:31.909> spin

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
higher so you have more time to spin

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.870 
higher so you have more time to spin
bars<00:01:34.659> so<00:01:35.659> but<00:01:36.369> once<00:01:37.369> you<00:01:37.520> know<00:01:37.610> how<00:01:37.640> to<00:01:37.790> I'm

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
bars so but once you know how to I'm

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.060 
bars so but once you know how to I'm
doing<00:01:38.060> pretty<00:01:38.180> good<00:01:38.420> you<00:01:39.409> don't<00:01:39.590> need<00:01:39.680> to<00:01:39.799> jump

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
doing pretty good you don't need to jump

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.789 
doing pretty good you don't need to jump
that<00:01:40.220> high<00:01:40.430> just<00:01:40.850> like<00:01:40.970> that<00:01:41.119> I<00:01:41.180> may<00:01:41.540> be

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.580 

so<00:01:45.799> going<00:01:46.700> to<00:01:46.729> spin<00:01:47.110> if<00:01:48.110> you're<00:01:48.259> holding<00:01:48.439> it

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
so going to spin if you're holding it

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.200 
so going to spin if you're holding it
like<00:01:48.710> this<00:01:49.659> you're<00:01:50.659> gonna<00:01:50.780> want<00:01:51.020> to<00:01:52.180> let<00:01:53.180> go

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
like this you're gonna want to let go

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.749 
like this you're gonna want to let go
when<00:01:53.720> you<00:01:53.840> jump<00:01:54.080> with<00:01:54.290> one<00:01:54.440> hand<00:01:54.650> sort<00:01:54.950> of<00:01:55.040> just

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
when you jump with one hand sort of just

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.859 
when you jump with one hand sort of just
a<00:01:55.820> bit<00:01:55.970> like<00:01:56.090> that<00:01:57.070> kind<00:01:58.070> of<00:01:58.100> like<00:01:58.220> that<00:01:58.869> and

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
a bit like that kind of like that and

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.520 
a bit like that kind of like that and
then<00:02:00.250> flick<00:02:01.250> it<00:02:01.399> with<00:02:01.430> your<00:02:01.700> thumb<00:02:01.729> and<00:02:02.530> then

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
then flick it with your thumb and then

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.529 
then flick it with your thumb and then
hold<00:02:03.860> on<00:02:03.979> with<00:02:04.039> this<00:02:04.250> hand<00:02:04.520> so<00:02:05.240> you<00:02:05.330> get<00:02:05.420> to

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
hold on with this hand so you get to

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:08.020 
hold on with this hand so you get to
like<00:02:05.659> here<00:02:06.020> and<00:02:06.140> then<00:02:06.560> kind<00:02:07.220> of<00:02:07.369> push<00:02:07.700> it<00:02:07.880> like

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
like here and then kind of push it like

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.740 
like here and then kind of push it like
that<00:02:08.179> with<00:02:08.330> your<00:02:08.420> fingers<00:02:08.810> and<00:02:09.050> catch<00:02:09.860> it<00:02:09.890> I

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.570 

can't<00:02:14.750> bar<00:02:14.959> spin<00:02:15.290> holding<00:02:15.709> my<00:02:15.860> bars<00:02:16.100> like<00:02:16.340> this

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
can't bar spin holding my bars like this

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.420 
can't bar spin holding my bars like this
as<00:02:17.150> I<00:02:17.420> said<00:02:17.480> before<00:02:17.680> so<00:02:18.680> I'm<00:02:18.980> not<00:02:19.010> going<00:02:19.220> to<00:02:19.280> do

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
as I said before so I'm not going to do

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.949 
as I said before so I'm not going to do
an<00:02:19.489> example<00:02:19.760> for<00:02:20.000> that<00:02:20.180> but<00:02:20.600> I'll<00:02:20.720> do<00:02:20.870> an

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
an example for that but I'll do an

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.860 
an example for that but I'll do an
example<00:02:21.230> for<00:02:21.530> holding<00:02:21.860> my<00:02:21.920> bars<00:02:22.430> like<00:02:22.580> this

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
example for holding my bars like this

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.340 
example for holding my bars like this
okay<00:02:24.400> so<00:02:25.510> when<00:02:26.510> you're<00:02:26.780> holding<00:02:27.080> your<00:02:27.170> bars

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
okay so when you're holding your bars

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.090 
okay so when you're holding your bars
like<00:02:27.530> this<00:02:28.630> it's<00:02:29.630> actually<00:02:29.780> not<00:02:30.680> really<00:02:30.739> like

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
like this it's actually not really like

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.949 
like this it's actually not really like
this<00:02:32.680> it's<00:02:33.680> more<00:02:33.860> like<00:02:34.010> this<00:02:34.750> make<00:02:35.750> like<00:02:35.930> a

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
this it's more like this make like a

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.259 
this it's more like this make like a
hook<00:02:36.230> with<00:02:36.260> your<00:02:36.470> finger<00:02:36.769> and<00:02:36.920> place<00:02:37.790> it<00:02:38.090> on

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
hook with your finger and place it on

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.620 
hook with your finger and place it on
the<00:02:38.330> side<00:02:38.900> there<00:02:39.910> and<00:02:40.910> grab<00:02:41.239> hold<00:02:41.420> with<00:02:41.540> your

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
the side there and grab hold with your

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.130 
the side there and grab hold with your
thumb<00:02:41.900> so<00:02:42.890> it's<00:02:42.980> like<00:02:43.100> that<00:02:43.930> all<00:02:44.930> right<00:02:45.700> okay

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
thumb so it's like that all right okay

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.759 
thumb so it's like that all right okay
then<00:02:49.780> when<00:02:50.780> you<00:02:50.870> jump<00:02:50.900> this<00:02:51.440> is<00:02:51.590> a<00:02:51.620> lot<00:02:51.739> easier

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
then when you jump this is a lot easier

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.880 
then when you jump this is a lot easier
you<00:02:52.579> just<00:02:52.820> kind<00:02:52.910> of<00:02:53.060> flick<00:02:53.420> your<00:02:53.769> flick<00:02:54.769> your

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
you just kind of flick your flick your

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.180 
you just kind of flick your flick your
wrist<00:02:54.950> forward<00:02:55.459> and<00:02:55.790> if<00:02:56.510> you<00:02:56.600> want<00:02:56.780> you<00:02:56.870> can<00:02:57.190> do

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
wrist forward and if you want you can do

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.559 
wrist forward and if you want you can do
the<00:02:58.340> hand<00:02:58.549> thing<00:02:58.609> really<00:02:59.600> doesn't<00:02:59.959> matter

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
the hand thing really doesn't matter

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:10.030 
the hand thing really doesn't matter
so<00:03:02.569> jump<00:03:04.659> flick<00:03:05.659> it<00:03:05.810> like<00:03:05.959> that<00:03:06.140> and<00:03:08.890> get<00:03:09.890> the

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
so jump flick it like that and get the

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.809 
so jump flick it like that and get the
motion<00:03:10.219> in<00:03:10.569> like<00:03:11.569> that<00:03:12.849> just<00:03:14.049> put<00:03:15.049> one<00:03:15.260> foot<00:03:15.439> on

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
motion in like that just put one foot on

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.080 
motion in like that just put one foot on
the<00:03:16.819> dead<00:03:17.230> for<00:03:18.230> now<00:03:18.349> and<00:03:18.950> just<00:03:19.010> try<00:03:19.849> and<00:03:19.939> get

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
the dead for now and just try and get

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:27.369 
the dead for now and just try and get
the<00:03:20.239> motion<00:03:22.329> now<00:03:23.329> just<00:03:24.260> like<00:03:24.409> that<00:03:26.170> might<00:03:27.170> take

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:27.379 
the motion now just like that might take

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.089 
the motion now just like that might take
a<00:03:27.439> while<00:03:27.879> to<00:03:28.879> get<00:03:29.590> what<00:03:30.590> eventually<00:03:30.920> you'll

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:31.099 
a while to get what eventually you'll

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.899 
a while to get what eventually you'll
get<00:03:31.250> it<00:03:31.780> that<00:03:33.189> and<00:03:34.189> then<00:03:34.459> you<00:03:34.549> gotta<00:03:34.730> learn<00:03:34.760> how

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:34.909 
get it that and then you gotta learn how

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:37.629 
get it that and then you gotta learn how
to<00:03:35.090> catch<00:03:35.420> it<00:03:35.599> properly<00:03:36.220> and<00:03:37.220> catching<00:03:37.579> is

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 
to catch it properly and catching is

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.250 
to catch it properly and catching is
pretty<00:03:37.819> easy<00:03:38.030> with<00:03:38.329> one<00:03:38.540> hand<00:03:38.750> the<00:03:38.959> Handy

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
pretty easy with one hand the Handy

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.259 
pretty easy with one hand the Handy
flick<00:03:39.500> with<00:03:39.709> because<00:03:40.519> it's<00:03:40.849> going<00:03:41.000> to<00:03:41.060> come

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
flick with because it's going to come

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.550 
flick with because it's going to come
around<00:03:42.010> automatically<00:03:43.060> like<00:03:44.060> this<00:03:44.359> and<00:03:45.319> then

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
around automatically like this and then

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.619 
around automatically like this and then
I'll<00:03:45.709> just<00:03:45.739> kind<00:03:46.010> of<00:03:46.099> like<00:03:46.389> autumn<00:03:47.389> I've<00:03:47.480> you

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:47.629 
I'll just kind of like autumn I've you

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.349 
I'll just kind of like autumn I've you
go<00:03:47.780> into<00:03:48.019> your<00:03:48.079> hand<00:03:48.459> but<00:03:49.459> it'll<00:03:49.700> be<00:03:49.730> hard<00:03:50.090> for

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:50.359 
go into your hand but it'll be hard for

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:53.589 
go into your hand but it'll be hard for
the<00:03:51.109> other<00:03:51.230> hand<00:03:51.500> because<00:03:52.159> you<00:03:53.120> have<00:03:53.239> to<00:03:53.389> go

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
the other hand because you have to go

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.809 
the other hand because you have to go
with<00:03:54.169> it<00:03:54.409> the<00:03:54.620> same<00:03:54.799> direction<00:03:54.980> that<00:03:55.370> it's<00:03:55.549> big

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819 
with it the same direction that it's big

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:59.559 
with it the same direction that it's big
that<00:03:56.389> it's<00:03:56.540> spinning<00:03:56.930> what's<00:03:57.919> up<00:03:58.450> gotta<00:03:59.450> go

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
that it's spinning what's up gotta go

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.089 
that it's spinning what's up gotta go
faster<00:03:59.959> so<00:04:00.079> you<00:04:00.109> can<00:04:00.290> catch<00:04:00.439> up<00:04:00.620> to<00:04:00.769> it<00:04:01.299> like

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
faster so you can catch up to it like

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:09.219 
faster so you can catch up to it like
like<00:04:04.099> that<00:04:04.700> sort<00:04:05.389> of<00:04:07.659> but<00:04:08.659> an<00:04:08.780> easier<00:04:09.079> way<00:04:09.199> to

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:09.229 
like that sort of but an easier way to

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:12.699 
like that sort of but an easier way to
do<00:04:09.470> it<00:04:09.590> is<00:04:09.769> to<00:04:10.129> have<00:04:10.370> it<00:04:10.430> like<00:04:10.699> this<00:04:10.940> and

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
do it is to have it like this and

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:17.620 
do it is to have it like this and
you<00:04:15.459> that'll<00:04:16.459> also<00:04:16.579> take<00:04:16.820> a<00:04:16.849> while<00:04:17.030> cuz<00:04:17.060> this<00:04:17.329> a

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
you that'll also take a while cuz this a

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:26.080 
you that'll also take a while cuz this a
bit<00:04:18.560> harder<00:04:18.949> to<00:04:18.979> do<00:04:20.709> but<00:04:21.709> it'll<00:04:22.010> come<00:04:24.729> yeah<00:04:25.729> so

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
bit harder to do but it'll come yeah so

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.920 
bit harder to do but it'll come yeah so
just<00:04:26.120> crisis<00:04:26.630> that<00:04:27.370> make<00:04:28.370> sure<00:04:28.520> you<00:04:28.780> froze<00:04:29.780> at

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
just crisis that make sure you froze at

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.640 
just crisis that make sure you froze at
a<00:04:29.990> steady<00:04:30.229> speed<00:04:30.400> like<00:04:31.400> this<00:04:31.639> and<00:04:32.570> then<00:04:32.750> lick

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
a steady speed like this and then lick

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:41.150 
a steady speed like this and then lick
it<00:04:33.680> a<00:04:33.830> good<00:04:34.240> small<00:04:35.240> jump<00:04:37.240> and<00:04:38.830> when

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
it a good small jump and when

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.260 
it a good small jump and when
when<00:04:41.280> you<00:04:41.430> know<00:04:41.520> how<00:04:41.640> to<00:04:41.700> do<00:04:41.820> it<00:04:41.940> should<00:04:42.150> look

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
when you know how to do it should look

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.630 
when you know how to do it should look
something<00:04:42.330> like<00:04:42.540> this
