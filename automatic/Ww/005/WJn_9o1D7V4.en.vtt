00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 good day my dear today to me 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.899
 goose feet curd cookies 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.639
 recipe old but beloved good 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.639
 Cookies get tasty homemade 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.740
 games are prepared effortlessly so 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.790
 let's start for the recipe we need 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.060
 make dough for us 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.070
 need 350 grams of flour is desirable 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.150
 use flour for baking it is more 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.550
 easy me this time here is such a flour 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.050
 405 d buy in the Baltic States but if 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.970
 take the usual let's say our 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.309
 Sokolniki familiar too 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.649
 great can add tea 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.469
 dough baking powder for about 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.450
 third or quarter teaspoon not 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.430
 slaked soda soda is needed for that 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.820
 extinguish the acid which is contained in 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.399
 curd stir then here 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.170
 add 200 grams very cold either 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.809
 butter or margarine 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.730
 oil can either be pre- cut 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.559
 either in the same way as it is now 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.780
 do I'm so glad to rub on a grater 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.059
 the oil must be very cold 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.399
 just out of the fridge you can even 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:08.250
 preface him put minutes for 15 20 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:10.350
 the freezer is so mastino 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.080
 flour mixture and and and quickly rubbed 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.850
 squirrel and baby even very small 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.000
 crumbs do not need eyes to 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.320
 there were no more pea pieces and 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.180
 in passing, I remind you that you need to rub 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.920
 fast enough to wish for a cold 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.590
 hands so my result was 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.630
 baby this lessons hold under the cold 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.430
 with water and then dry and that's it 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.530
 quickly rub with cold hands 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.979
 to us the process of rubbing is not 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.900
 melted butter into and not soaked in flour 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.470
 also recipe we need 400 grams 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.180
 cottage cheese 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.710
 I have 9 percent on but you can 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.070
 use cottage cheese of any fat content 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.560
 vices I rubbed then poured in here 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.079
 prepared baby and now doing 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.630
 so that mixing the dough we need all that 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:55.049
 what we gathered in a bowl to collect in the dough and 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.939
 achieve more or less uniformity then 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.860
 knead the dough is not worth 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.869
 click on knead it pretty quickly 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.670
 as I said since 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.829
 lengthy kneading first melt 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.079
 oil secondly may develop a wig 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.940
 flour wines as a result of our cookies 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.129
 get tight they should be 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.960
 crumbly end up with us should 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.280
 get soft 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.550
 or less uniform in consistency 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.500
 dough weather notice that since flour 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.200
 everywhere different threshold different just in 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.090
 square you the process of mixing is possible 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.400
 will need to adjust the trailer under 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.310
 so I got myself very soft 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.710
 dough is sticky then i'm okay 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.870
 in this no she absolutely does not stretch it 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.120
 also means cookies very well 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.960
 get crumbly dough round and 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.540
 send in the fridge for 30-40 minutes 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:45.270
 as I said since the threshold and the flour 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.790
 different as possible process 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.410
 add in the process of kneading add more 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.260
 a little flour if the dough turns out 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.690
 very sticky but don't rush to add 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.760
 unnecessarily flour since with sticky dough 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.540
 You can always agree, but if 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.480
 a lot of flour 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.310
 it is much more difficult and on the other 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.740
 sides if you are cooking curd 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.630
 cookies for the first time and especially 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:10.260
 if you have dry cottage cheese you may 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:13.380
 it makes sense not to start with 350 grams of flour 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.520
 let's say 300 uah there is no kneading process at 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.100
 need to add 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:20.820
 but this time rolled out a dough harness 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.920
 This does not get bars bundle diameter 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.920
 depends on what kind of cookies do you want 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.830
 eventually get a little bigger 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.940
 either very large dough divide 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.170
 preferably in equal pieces 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.060
 Italy I will leave on the table only 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.700
 the dough with which I will work and everything 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.920
 I will collect the rest in a bowl and while Iâ€™ll put it in 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.020
 the refrigerator will not be two baking sheets 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.790
 cookies i will bake them two turns 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:49.680
 so half drooping a bowl we remove a 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.310
 half the prepared dough i will 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.250
 roll out 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.530
 you can tell in different ways than 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.690
 Now show on the Volga, select a 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.170
 it is more convenient for you I use both 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:04.080
 we will need a wide mood 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.940
 small plate of sugar poured out 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.850
 about two canteens on a plate 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.040
 spoons of sugar 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.960
 dough knead the cake and then 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.109
 we press in sugar as a result of us 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.720
 it turns out one country of sugar cakes 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:22.140
 the other is sugar free we fold sugar 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.810
 with the side inside we press sugar again and 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:27.500
 in this way, we add 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.500
 a cookie 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:34.889
 this is one way for the second way 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:38.400
 we need a rolling pin and first we 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:40.410
 you need to roll our dough pieces at 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.509
 rolling out if the dough is sticky of course 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.789
 use flour but use 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:47.000
 flour only if necessary and just in 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:49.229
 minimum quantities 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.180
 roll ready thickness that you 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:52.680
 find it necessary and do not strive for 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.970
 rolling out to comply 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:59.280
 very clear circle this size I have 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.110
 got a jump to the outer corner before 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.330
 how will you give sugar necessarily 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.699
 shake off 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.500
 even if the circle you get is uneven 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:10.680
 nothing scary right cookie get 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.930
 neat and even again before pouring 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.720
 sapp on one side we fold sugar 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:20.030
 side inward 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:22.949
 once again in half all the time with sugar inside 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:25.289
 so that's half the addition we 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:28.050
 get another cookie look 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:30.300
 what she puff prepared cookies 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.449
 bake in preheated until 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:36.770
 200 210 degrees Celsius oven to 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:40.889
 browning around 15 minutes 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:42.870
 never looks after baking now i'm 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:44.849
 I would like to show you the difference here 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.380
 I formed a cookie in the so-called 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:49.400
 by hand without splitting 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:51.510
 and here it rolled as you see 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:55.530
 rolled looks neater she 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:58.080
 more puffy but each one is good 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:00.960
 in its own way here it is not so beautiful 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:03.840
 and she would have been not so flaky she 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:07.020
 more tender here is this cookie 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.940
 she is very flaky neatly her can 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.190
 just here and so calmly 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.840
 disassemble on your 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.909
 i like someone else option pike 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.639
 and so and so can not even say what 

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:19.580
 of which I like more so ours 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:22.409
 goose feet curd cookies are ready 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.930
 clear from the traditional wish pleasant 

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:27.960
 tea party cook try very 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.669
 I hope that you will like them too. 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.870
 that were with me and watched the video and 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:32.870
