00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.390
 hello today I will tell in processing 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.189
 I apologize for this photo in advance 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.780
 sound quality because i'm recording on 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.200
 built-in microphone maybe you hear 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.170
 noise and 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:17.539
 and so this is of course that and this is our 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.949
 the first layer to the second layer here i 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:23.850
 met 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:27.140
 windshield and side use for 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:32.690
 this mask the next layer 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:42.660
 removed various highlights from the background 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:45.079
 here here here passed no took 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:51.020
 paint the plot photos for some reason 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:57.360
 did not like further go layers 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:59.010
 if you turn off the mask you will see a flashlight 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:05.549
 ladyship I look only interested in me 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:09.630
 front of the car can be done 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:15.720
 visible only this layer and also for 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:18.330
 side of the car further go 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.540
 the wheels alternately I visited the front 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.540
 wheel 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.390
 here is this photo with the front wheel and 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:38.350
 back the same thing i mean i mix 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.750
 different exposure it's pretty simple 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:45.009
 if you shoot your camera with a tripod 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:50.440
 motionless to combine different photos 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:54.750
 pretty easy further his faces with the earth i 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.750
 also shone a flashlight on the earth and and 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:05.350
 actually see the result of a small 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.840
 gradient to do this area and 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:12.130
 brighter 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:15.730
 Next comes a more detailed retouching 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:20.100
 car you see I removed the glare 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.100
 which I liked 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:29.130
 also present here is the chest yen on 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:31.709
 the hood here here you see small 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:37.050
 I didn't like color reflexes 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:40.430
 so I painted them extended this one 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:47.280
 line of saint 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:49.610
 removed the glare of the back of the car on 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.610
 the doors 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:03.920
 next I have another layer here I 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.920
 removed the glare slightly vova glass 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:15.510
 little andrew 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:17.630
 photo further gradient on glasses 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.580
 maybe I have a very realistic but 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:27.330
 at that moment it seemed that he looked 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:30.270
 not bad curve total curve for raising 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.720
 brightness to make the picture a little and 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.720
 juicier 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:42.620
 then I added a little vignetting 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:42.620
 and groups and layers with highlights 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:53.270
 these layers 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:56.720
 responsible for the glare as you can see all 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:59.000
 quite simple if you have the 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:03.460
 questions can ask them in 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.460
 comments thanks for watching
