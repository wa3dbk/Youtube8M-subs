00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
have right now and like it kind of gets

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.660 
have right now and like it kind of gets
confusing<00:02:51.690> on<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:51.900> bottom<00:02:52.200> so<00:02:52.350> installed<00:02:52.860> by

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
confusing on the bottom so installed by

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.670 
confusing on the bottom so installed by
packages<00:02:54.600> and<00:02:54.780> I<00:02:54.810> think<00:02:55.050> those<00:02:55.260> are<00:02:55.290> the

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
packages and I think those are the

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.410 
packages and I think those are the
sources<00:02:56.100> that<00:02:56.190> automatically<00:02:56.850> come<00:02:57.180> with

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
sources that automatically come with

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.870 
sources that automatically come with
