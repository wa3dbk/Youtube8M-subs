00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.469
 no pain listen all know me well 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:12.630
 so I will say it right as I can 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:16.770
 if our destiny is to die it is the way it is 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.730
 it will be but I conjure you since we 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.810
 destined to accept death from these bastards 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.810
 sell your life more expensive 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.380
 Hello dear friends and lovers 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.820
 world of tanks today I want to show you 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.340
 video continued 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.170
 how to behave at turbo plums like i 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.329
 mentioned in the past video on this 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.399
 themes that your rivals felt 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.730
 their superiority will trample on you crowd 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.289
 and here it is necessary to take a moment and 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.989
 shoot the vehicles moving on you 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.180
 which while driving has less 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.460
 accuracy and most importantly you must stay 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.680
 longer in service and at the same time take 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.350
 the trunks of this video is very bright 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.070
 This situation is described for this 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.580
 the moment we play on the monastery map and with 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.420
 weighing six we are heading for 1 shooting gallery 2 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:13.619
 Lines by the way from 6 will play very much 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.780
 a key role in this fight he is very me 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.689
 will help but in principle not only me but 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.490
 our team that we will accelerate a little bit 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:26.189
 our video I play on premium tanchiki 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:29.159
 t-34 but also my main assistant plays on 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.930
 Premium All sixth I ask 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.189
 draw your attention to what we are 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.890
 we are not in the top we have and 9 in 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.900
 the level is lit up here now 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.990
 second and please note that 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.460
 while I drove to interesting points where I 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.380
 I can ask to hide my 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.340
 upper and lower armor for sticking 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:54.990
 May 14 already 03 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.850
 not in our favor we have merged t-44 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:03.850
 medium tank of the eighth level black 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:06.250
 prince and t71 in principle, these players could 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.910
 render of course much more benefit 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.250
 than to merge yes there immediately at the beginning of the battle 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.920
 well then we continue to keep 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.010
 direction 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.320
 rivals are not moving on us 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.110
 here, too, I shoot back 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.110
 I decided to charge high-explosive shells so 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.380
 still very difficult for me 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.660
 punch turret tegra 2 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.720
 trophim there to aim after all he 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:38.290
 it is not close I would say 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.050
 distance from t34 are famous for their 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.200
 anti precision here we get ricochet 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.450
 account already 14 he continues to be not in 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.390
 our favor here is wonderful turned 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.660
 to me the side of the tower and I forgot that I have 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.030
 land mines and of course I do not have a fulda mage 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.700
 a judge would be more pleasant for 400 damage 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.610
 what is tiger 2 a little scared 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.239
 rolls back and here we see that 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:07.200
 us beacons indicate that we 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:11.950
 broke through the flank and go to our base 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:16.120
 about 35 you are not in our favor so what 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:19.180
 Well, we continue to help our 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.829
 Ally closer to our base here from 6 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.610
 since he was naturally behind me 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:26.920
 turned around and he was already ahead of me 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:30.579
 we continue to move us all the same 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:33.760
 need to somehow win damage 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:36.190
 pick up the trunks after all we want 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.590
 Of course to win the score 37 is not in ours 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.829
 favor, that is, an ordinary player will say everything 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:45.160
 This sink will give up but you don't need it 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:47.170
 do you need to fight to the end here from 6 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.709
 vox learns writes but iraq i.e. he 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:53.320
 unhappy of course with our position in 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:56.340
 the moment but still hope 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:59.640
 dies last as they say 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.519
 but given that the bill is already 38 hopes 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:06.440
 it remains only how to say the horns yes 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:09.360
 legs well we are in a position 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.780
 we take out only our turret and we will 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.580
 aiming our enemies here is just a file 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.400
 I forget that I still have 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.639
 high-explosive projectile su-100 59 damage but 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.669
 thank god of 6 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:27.600
 gets sacrifice all of 3 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:29.940
 they still 6 chooses a sacrifice by 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.880
 which I shot all 59 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.070
 we keep pulling this out 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.460
 the position that ours have spoiled 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.950
 allies with their turbo merge and so all 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.800
 also 69 my allies are shooting back 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.720
 take enemies too i'm trying a 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.060
 wait until it appears 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.850
 This is a Chinese miracle without waiting to see 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.530
 that costs us flank it's posh 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.680
 pretty interesting his armor 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:59.160
 oblique aim a shot 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.479
 pick up in the hangar account then look 89 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.280
 how quickly all the same we fixed 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:05.760
 the position after the fact that our enemies 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.940
 drove us crowd and basically here 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:11.900
 they lost all their flags all 99 too 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:14.700
 we compared position but panic not 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:19.680
 continues let's say leave us still 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:22.979
 E75 remains good damage for t-34 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:27.860
 3 continues to help him and here two 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:29.940
 Tanchika I hide their vulnerabilities and 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.639
 I wait for that moment when all the same 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:36.570
 they will appear rivals but already in my 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:38.729
 sight well i look that behind me from 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.470
 6 which seems so bad help 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:42.780
 he shoots so good 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.690
 pick up 34-ku 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.550
 send it to the hangar all 1210 already in 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:50.430
 our favor to pay attention what account 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:53.240
 still was 93 already 1210 wonderful 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:56.660
 just pulled the allies fight 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.970
 here we take still have 75 well 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.840
 go to the hangar but our mission 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.400
 done 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:09.650
 done on this score 13:11 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:12.740
 out of 6 goes for another frag 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:15.710
 which let's say is more dangerous than 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:19.580
 March in this position, he basically 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:21.050
 shot for him well, there 's fifty more 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.479
 four points it surrounds that is here 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.099
 everything is already clear yes all the team 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:26.139
 lost rivals although they had 

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:27.919
 simply 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:30.949
 wonderful unique opportunity 

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:34.039
 win but they did not take advantage 

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:36.560
 and lost all the mistake was that 

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:38.330
 these enemies flooded us mob we 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.030
 stood still naturally they are with us 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:44.870
 were in sight and got in their 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:47.030
 punishment they all went to the hangar well 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.009
 well we won thank you for 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:53.199
 view and never despair and 

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:53.199
 see the fight to the end all bye
