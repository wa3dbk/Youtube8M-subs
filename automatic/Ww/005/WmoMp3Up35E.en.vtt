00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.559
 as always a papo to learn and 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.139
 guide us on issues of associativity 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.990
 solidarity today will explain that this 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.480
 differential focus hi dad 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.090
 hello daiana and hello to all of us 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.240
 tune in to this time in organizations 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:29.119
 solidarity tv in institutional signal the 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.279
 public media system like you 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.220
 You know my role is to accompany them and 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.500
 guide them in the topic of entrepreneurship 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:39.290
 associative solidarity today we will be 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:43.090
 talking about the differential approach but 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.090
 that differential approach 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.260
 I do not know 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:53.480
 I do not have clarity about the concept 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.480
 it's because it's aimed at populations 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.480
 specific 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.870
 good as we see it is necessary to clarify the 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.780
 topic 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.550
 the differential approach is to recognize and 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.170
 make the existence of 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.560
 populations that by their characteristics 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.680
 individuals by reason of their age gender 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.320
 sexual orientation ethnic group and 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.330
 Disability situation should receive 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.420
 special treatment in terms of 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.310
 humanitarian aid attention assistance and 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.030
 protection of the rights of this 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.610
 population 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.010
 the differential approach plays a role 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.409
 important as a tool that should 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.960
 handle all public officials and in 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.479
 special those institutions whose 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.830
 obligation is to ensure the good and 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.750
 the enjoyment of the rights of 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.000
 citizens as is the case with 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.710
 persons remember that the approach 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.200
 differential allows 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.940
 and make visible the recrudescence of 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.250
 violence and the violation of rights 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.170
 humans in a systematic way to 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.840
 populations and groups considered 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.050
 historically and culturally as 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.300
 discriminatory criteria evidence the 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.240
 absence of public policies with 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.310
 rights approach pointing out the 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.520
 difficulties and resistances for 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.950
 recognize inequalities asymmetries 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.670
 vulnerability and needs of 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.620
 populations considered as different 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.019
 show the invisibility and vision 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.050
 limited on the characteristics of 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:26.239
 said populations if you have concerns 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.430
 want to do some paperwork or have 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.739
