will experience as you enter this loop

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.880 
will experience as you enter this loop
will<00:01:28.410> be<00:01:29.840> 6g<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:31.289> gives<00:01:31.500> me<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.619> bit<00:01:31.740> more

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
will be 6g it gives me a bit more
