00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
fighting in most of the grain stocks in

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.709 
fighting in most of the grain stocks in
fact<00:01:53.479> is<00:01:54.479> these<00:01:55.049> are<00:01:55.110> very<00:01:55.530> very<00:01:56.090> good<00:01:57.090> in<00:01:57.149> cold

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
fact is these are very very good in cold

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.249 
fact is these are very very good in cold
weather<00:01:57.869> so<00:01:58.350> when<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.430> goes<00:02:00.000> under<00:02:00.259> freezing

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
weather so when it goes under freezing

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.880 
weather so when it goes under freezing
point<00:02:01.670> he<00:02:02.670> still<00:02:03.420> performs<00:02:04.020> very<00:02:04.469> very<00:02:04.680> well

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
point he still performs very very well

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.169 
point he still performs very very well
so<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.549> is<00:02:05.579> even<00:02:05.909> better<00:02:06.290> with<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:08.179> bear

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
so it is even better with the bear

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
eternal life over the same capacity and

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:21.280 
eternal life over the same capacity and
this<00:02:14.959> towards<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:17.840> too<00:02:18.840> much<00:02:19.849> under

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
this towards the too much under

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.500 
this towards the too much under
underwater<00:02:22.290> you<00:02:22.650> better<00:02:22.980> and<00:02:23.340> can<00:02:24.030> exit
