external signal from another flash it

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.010 
external signal from another flash it
just<00:03:13.910> will<00:03:14.320> a<00:03:15.320> fire<00:03:16.280> when<00:03:16.910> it<00:03:17.030> gets<00:03:17.270> the<00:03:17.630> signal

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
just will a fire when it gets the signal

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.440 
just will a fire when it gets the signal
from<00:03:18.590> the<00:03:18.770> connector<00:03:19.190> here<00:03:19.430> whether<00:03:20.000> it's<00:03:20.270> on

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
from the connector here whether it's on

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.710 
from the connector here whether it's on
the<00:03:20.630> camera<00:03:20.930> or<00:03:21.140> whether<00:03:21.980> it's<00:03:22.430> in<00:03:22.730> it's<00:03:23.270> on<00:03:23.540> a

the camera or whether it's in it's on a
trigger<00:03:24.050> okay<00:03:24.590> then<00:03:25.400> you<00:03:25.580> have<00:03:25.700> the<00:03:25.850> S<00:03:26.120> mode

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
trigger okay then you have the S mode

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.270 
trigger okay then you have the S mode
this<00:03:26.900> is<00:03:27.110> for<00:03:27.470> a<00:03:27.709> slave<00:03:28.220> it<00:03:28.850> means<00:03:30.100> when<00:03:31.100> it<00:03:31.250> is

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
this is for a slave it means when it is

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.229 
this is for a slave it means when it is
another<00:03:31.910> flash<00:03:32.330> fire<00:03:33.080> then<00:03:33.860> it<00:03:34.100> fires<00:03:34.310> -<00:03:34.700> the

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
another flash fire then it fires - the

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.600 
another flash fire then it fires - the
problem<00:03:35.630> is<00:03:35.750> some<00:03:36.020> camera<00:03:36.410> or<00:03:36.590> some<00:03:37.130> flashes

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
problem is some camera or some flashes

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.840 
problem is some camera or some flashes
have<00:03:37.820> a<00:03:38.150> brief<00:03:38.480> flash<00:03:38.720> so<00:03:39.440> then<00:03:40.190> it<00:03:40.340> could<00:03:40.550> fire

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
have a brief flash so then it could fire

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.420 
have a brief flash so then it could fire
in<00:03:41.239> the<00:03:41.540> in<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:41.840> runtime<00:03:42.080> so<00:03:42.860> for<00:03:43.130> that<00:03:43.250> you

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
in the in the runtime so for that you

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.270 
in the in the runtime so for that you
have<00:03:43.489> the<00:03:43.730> mode<00:03:44.150> which<00:03:44.420> is<00:03:44.570> called<00:03:44.780> s2<00:03:45.440> if<00:03:45.800> this

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
have the mode which is called s2 if this

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.460 
have the mode which is called s2 if this
is<00:03:46.670> the<00:03:46.910> flash<00:03:47.150> that<00:03:47.480> you're<00:03:47.630> going<00:03:47.870> to<00:03:47.900> use<00:03:48.200> to

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
is the flash that you're going to use to

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.630 
is the flash that you're going to use to
find<00:03:48.709> this<00:03:49.010> one<00:03:49.310> as<00:03:50.209> a<00:03:50.840> pre<00:03:51.350> flash<00:03:51.590> you<00:03:52.100> should

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
find this one as a pre flash you should

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.630 
find this one as a pre flash you should
use<00:03:52.850> it<00:03:53.030> on<00:03:53.180> s2<00:03:53.810> okay<00:03:54.500> then<00:03:55.250> you<00:03:55.400> have<00:03:55.459> the

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
use it on s2 okay then you have the

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.259 
use it on s2 okay then you have the
multi<00:03:56.239> mode<00:03:56.500> multi<00:03:57.500> is<00:03:57.709> sports<00:03:58.280> from<00:03:58.730> scopic
