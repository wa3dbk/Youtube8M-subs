00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:11.440
 we handle that is the basic the casual and 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:13.119
 the formal and those possibilities a lot 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.440
 people enter for example the store and it says 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.050
 where is it from and when do you say it is 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.970
 Peruvian are surprised then a little 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.920

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.509
 artists with no collaborations 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.509

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.820
 offer them 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.450
 Quality is a very important factor 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.049
 but design is a factor of 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.500
 differentiation 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:53.180
 this is a simple shirt yes but inside 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.369
 of the simplicity that it has because the 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.610
 quality is excellent and the contrasts of 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.560
 fabrics and he was clear and he's had a 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.630
 penis in pledge that's a bit of a process 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.030
 more complex than what is usually done 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.189
 we try to emphasize 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.189
 just in those little details 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.280
 you can see the tonalities as they go 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.720
 varying throughout the garment 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.720
 in that month 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.200
 within these for example these 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:33.800
 shirts are fashionable we go to one of these 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.800

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.099

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.830

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.870

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.580
 also that you want to feel different 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.680
 wants to have a different end then 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:56.360
 those things are important to reinforce and has 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:59.959
 wanted to work literally is how 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.610
 repress repress a bit that question 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.090
 staff what is reflected in 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.090
 through clothes 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:13.240
 this is for example we this part 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:18.190
 from the most formal line that communicated 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:19.570
 to itself that is like our embo that 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.250
 we inside we must classify it 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:25.080
 as a human if it's a little more formal 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.880
 and we also emphasize what they are 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.970
 the accessories that those plans also 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.370
 the ties my joke can not be the 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.170
 match with the handkerchief that excellent theme 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.330
 of the thin ties and that too 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.030
 it's like sharpening the silhouette very much 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:42.120
 gives him that youthful touch that is 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:45.240
 important and it's really so 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.260
