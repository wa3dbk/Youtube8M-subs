00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.190
 As a welcome barbecue, we continue our times 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:14.369
 we make chicken breast stuffed with dried tomatoes and olives 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:18.220
 we have worried unsightly in the southeast 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.279
 and they are going to clean up a bit to remove it 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.489
 and also the inside laid 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:25.259
 then you can cut in to fit 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.259
 ours also 15 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.240
 I am glad that we disturb such a one ourselves 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.620
 bit away 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.570
 can get bones in ignorance 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.070
 this is not a problem 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.840
 but then ours 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.230
 many already cleaned 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.140
 no pig more easy with a pointed knife 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.140
 want with harsh 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.350
 at the club are really nice 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.560
 Packs ours 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.560
 Fill 9 Make Demel Comparison 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.520
 For our stuffing was worried dried tomatoes and olives 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.390
 dried tomatoes meanwhile you go very much in the glass a lot 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.430
 of course warmer dried buys better and she lays herself 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.230
 fresh herbs but still we make it ourselves fulfillment for us humans 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.630
 greatest 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.630
 they say the dried tomatoes are already settled 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.600
 depending on your taste 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.730
 my sizes 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.730
 he leaves 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.220
 I opted for black olives 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.160
 especially as it is a bit beautiful i am the most 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.590
 as well as the Greens 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.040
 as Koller 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.500
 Habich Strauss GSO Kroes Mariensaal is based on a bit of thyme 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.100
 but of course it does 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.100
 Taste issues of the chef 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.690
 we have to cut a bit small 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.230
 he 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.450
 OK 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.190
 the advantage of pickled tomatoes is 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.790
 if I already have relatively good Wulz BÃ¶hm with me, then I do not have to 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:09.939
 more that much 

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:12.939
 only to like to do 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:17.299
 Of course he also wants to 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:20.299
 the black and yellow want morning or mozzarella or gorgonzola 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.829
 to taste can give 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:25.829
 So a little more binding 

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:29.689
 but we want without 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:31.959
 relatively low in fat 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.729
 Have cut small 

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:36.809
 now grants 9 

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:39.069
 of course a bit of space 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.630
 have the buzzword and would like us 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.619
 and controls 

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:47.619
 sage 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.319
 CMOS Marys 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.989
 and feel a bit too 500 

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:01.959
 2 is only 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.289
 You have to do it in a small way 

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:08.289
 Prof 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.579
 priest 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.549
 it is enough and already 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.079
 to the courier 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:20.079
 like bowl 

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:26.409
 just a little bit of mess salt over it 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:27.980
 main focuses 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.319
 the students enjoy Chile's supposed to 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.319
 DAPD 

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:38.189
 a little bit confused 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:41.189
 if brown I rubble too much about my fresh herbs 

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:43.069
 maximum 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:44.849
 Foreman Motors 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.699
 a little bit 

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:49.399
 Now we are leading ours 

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:51.709
 the civilians 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.709
 I now have more beautiful decorate 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.959
 filled young people 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:15.219
 Now we just have to start a bit off with Verbund Salt Mine as one 

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:17.639
 bit careful as I said hamlet 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:18.879
 already the filling 

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:20.799
 seasoned 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.799
 and then yes to spectrum comes around 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.430
 Anger over ours 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.919
 ham 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:35.499
 just get on the board 

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:37.689
 what the PIN ham take 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:40.610
 Mirror through all of them 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.460
 I always like the Black Forest ham and a bit 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.139
 use strong Gerold 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.139
 could through a few machines 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:53.610
 - just so pure 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.939
 and he has to happen by accident 

00:04:56.939 --> 00:05:00.009
 they see that it's not witchcraft 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:02.620
 plushy has the advantage that he too 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.460
 space 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.839
 Finerman tender chicken a bit 

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:07.729
 protects from the consoles 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.729
 bounce 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:15.129
 and 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:18.129
 - Looks a bit too low, "Appel Cage 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:20.460
 already punishable 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.460
 that the filling can get me out 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.509
 Now we have prepared our chicken breast a lot 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:31.909
 how will they roast now at high heat and continue low heat 

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:32.990
 gentle heat 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.240
 finish cooking 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.469
 to care 

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:39.389
 Inzlingen and 10 are 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:42.389
 to the Kremlin 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.460
 otherwise it will happen the 10th 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.270
 two three minutes done 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.110
 belong and then by motto No 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.800
 usually you have to be able to google 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.520
 do not turn the food anymore 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.820
 I still like it alone because of the optics because the eye he is with that must now 

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:06.819
 Opel is set to make 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:11.770
 90+ already 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.770
 nice that grilling nut village 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:18.330
 still lively use 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.330
 and the temperatures are a bit rounder 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:24.639
 times like that 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:27.639
 not to be able to 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.509
 and so is Arens IPOs readers 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:33.289
 the optimal even reaches temperature 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:35.879
 luckily chatter is already happening 

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:38.879
 nice for our guests 

00:06:53.869 --> 00:06:54.609
 unexpectedly
