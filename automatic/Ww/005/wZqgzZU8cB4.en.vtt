that light is on it Don my light cycle

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.610 
that light is on it Don my light cycle
and<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.219> guy<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:41.460> on<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.820> switch<00:00:42.120> so<00:00:42.989> when

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
and that guy is on the switch so when

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
fossberg acid air filter it takes out

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.209 
fossberg acid air filter it takes out
like<00:00:56.789> ninety-nine<00:00:57.210> percent<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:58.219> ammonia

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
like ninety-nine percent of the ammonia

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.630 
like ninety-nine percent of the ammonia
fumes<00:00:59.550> from<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.059> rats<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.809> snakes<00:01:01.109> and

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
larger onboarding grill so I just kind

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.880 
larger onboarding grill so I just kind
of<00:01:23.070> move<00:01:23.220> them<00:01:23.369> up<00:01:23.430> as<00:01:23.640> ago<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.560> we've<00:01:25.560> got<00:01:25.740> an

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
of move them up as ago and we've got an

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.490 
of move them up as ago and we've got an
inline<00:01:26.310> water<00:01:26.640> valve<00:01:27.000> coming<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.479> our<00:01:28.259> water

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
inline water valve coming in our water

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.560 
inline water valve coming in our water
feed<00:01:28.770> hooked<00:01:29.490> up<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:29.729> little<00:01:29.939> switch<00:01:30.180> and

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
feed hooked up this little switch and

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.359 
feed hooked up this little switch and
that<00:01:31.320> just<00:01:31.530> runs<00:01:31.680> right<00:01:31.829> into<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.189> reservoir

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
that just runs right into the reservoir

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.170 
that just runs right into the reservoir
and<00:01:33.049> that<00:01:34.049> thing<00:01:34.259> run<00:01:34.439> then<00:01:34.619> runs<00:01:34.920> my<00:01:35.880> grits

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
and that thing run then runs my grits

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.819 
and that thing run then runs my grits
just<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.659> gravity-fed<00:01:37.110> water<00:01:37.170> system<00:01:37.710> like

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
just a gravity-fed water system like

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.980 
just a gravity-fed water system like
most<00:01:38.009> amp<00:01:38.280> but<00:01:38.970> looking<00:01:39.299> back<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.540> should<00:01:39.720> have

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
most amp but looking back I should have

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.950 
most amp but looking back I should have
just<00:01:40.079> put<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.579> water<00:01:41.579> valve<00:01:41.939> fill<00:01:42.479> up<00:01:42.630> in<00:01:42.780> line

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
just put the water valve fill up in line

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.520 
just put the water valve fill up in line
water<00:01:43.259> right<00:01:43.770> into<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.159> been<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.720> gravity

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
water right into the been to the gravity

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.850 
water right into the been to the gravity
system<00:01:46.770> it's<00:01:47.670> kind<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:47.909> stupid<00:01:48.119> good<00:01:48.860> well

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
system it's kind of stupid good well

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.440 
system it's kind of stupid good well
anyways<00:01:50.220> oh<00:01:50.610> here's<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.479> oil-filled<00:01:52.229> radiator

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
anyways oh here's a oil-filled radiator

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.539 
anyways oh here's a oil-filled radiator
I<00:01:54.450> just<00:01:55.380> have<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.560> fan<00:01:55.799> sitting<00:01:56.040> out<00:01:56.250> right<00:01:56.430> now
