00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:08.850 
all right everyone for part two of the

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.240 
all right everyone for part two of the
hair<00:00:09.120> tutorial<00:00:10.080> this<00:00:10.440> is<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.650> back<00:00:10.950> of<00:00:10.980> the

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
hair tutorial this is the back of the

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.920 
hair tutorial this is the back of the
head<00:00:11.549> of<00:00:11.790> one<00:00:12.420> figure<00:00:14.330> we're<00:00:15.330> gonna<00:00:15.420> use<00:00:15.719> an

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:15.930 
head of one figure we're gonna use an

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:22.669 
head of one figure we're gonna use an
extruder<00:00:17.359> this<00:00:18.359> this<00:00:19.109> is<00:00:19.260> called<00:00:21.019> a<00:00:22.019> fondant

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:22.679 
extruder this this is called a fondant

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:27.650 
extruder this this is called a fondant
extruder<00:00:22.919> or<00:00:23.849> a<00:00:24.140> sugar<00:00:25.140> craft<00:00:25.560> gun<00:00:26.329> it<00:00:27.329> comes

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
extruder or a sugar craft gun it comes

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.349 
extruder or a sugar craft gun it comes
with<00:00:27.929> many<00:00:28.230> different<00:00:28.529> disks<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.490> for<00:00:30.210> the

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
with many different disks and for the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.280 
with many different disks and for the
hair<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:31.169> got<00:00:31.349> three<00:00:31.650> different<00:00:31.769> ones<00:00:33.290> very

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
hair you got three different ones very

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.900 
hair you got three different ones very
different<00:00:35.330> sizes<00:00:36.330> so<00:00:37.340> let's<00:00:38.340> use<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.700> middle

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
different sizes so let's use the middle

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.930 
different sizes so let's use the middle
one<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.330> have<00:00:40.230> an<00:00:40.350> idea<00:00:40.560> what<00:00:40.740> its<00:00:40.860> gonna<00:00:41.820> look

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
one so have an idea what its gonna look

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.460 
one so have an idea what its gonna look
like<00:00:42.090> pop<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.690> in<00:00:44.060> when<00:00:45.060> I<00:00:45.390> use<00:00:45.720> the<00:00:45.870> extruder<00:00:46.200> I

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470 
like pop it in when I use the extruder I

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.600 
like pop it in when I use the extruder I
prefer<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.250> use<00:00:47.810> fondant<00:00:49.190> inside<00:00:50.190> but<00:00:50.370> for

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
prefer to use fondant inside but for

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.810 
prefer to use fondant inside but for
this<00:00:50.820> other<00:00:51.480> figure<00:00:52.250> gum<00:00:53.250> paste<00:00:53.400> would<00:00:53.610> work

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
this other figure gum paste would work

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.860 
this other figure gum paste would work
better<00:00:54.800> find<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.920> because<00:00:56.070> when<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.970> press<00:00:57.750> it

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
better find it because when you press it

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.550 
better find it because when you press it
it's<00:00:58.740> easier<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.310> come<00:00:59.460> out<00:00:59.660> so<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.990> also<00:01:01.200> need

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:01.560 
it's easier to come out so you also need

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:09.200 
it's easier to come out so you also need
a<00:01:01.950> blade<00:01:02.790> or<00:01:04.040> a<00:01:05.040> cutter<00:01:06.409> so<00:01:07.409> use<00:01:08.369> edible<00:01:08.999> glue

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
a blade or a cutter so use edible glue

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:18.700 
a blade or a cutter so use edible glue
and<00:01:09.530> paint<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.770> on<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:12.649> areas<00:01:13.649> that<00:01:14.399> you<00:01:14.609> would

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.320 

clip<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.829> gum<00:01:20.039> paste<00:01:20.069> on

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.700 

all<00:01:25.330> right<00:01:25.450> again<00:01:25.630> I'm<00:01:25.900> not<00:01:26.110> an<00:01:26.260> expert<00:01:26.560> on

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
all right again I'm not an expert on

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.740 
all right again I'm not an expert on
this<00:01:26.979> this<00:01:27.159> is<00:01:27.220> how<00:01:27.430> I<00:01:27.460> managed<00:01:28.090> to<00:01:28.210> put<00:01:28.450> here

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
this this is how I managed to put here

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.000 
this this is how I managed to put here
my<00:01:29.620> figures<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:32.140> what<00:01:32.290> we're<00:01:32.409> gonna<00:01:32.500> do<00:01:32.770> now

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
my figures and what we're gonna do now

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:40.350 
my figures and what we're gonna do now
is<00:01:33.340> kind<00:01:34.119> of<00:01:34.240> imagine<00:01:34.930> a<00:01:35.200> line<00:01:37.200> here<00:01:38.700> here<00:01:39.700> and

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
is kind of imagine a line here here and

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.609 
is kind of imagine a line here here and
at<00:01:40.630> the<00:01:40.720> very<00:01:40.869> top<00:01:40.990> so<00:01:42.630> yeah<00:01:43.630> we're<00:01:44.320> gonna<00:01:44.410> do

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
at the very top so yeah we're gonna do

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.070 
at the very top so yeah we're gonna do
like<00:01:44.860> two<00:01:45.190> layers<00:01:46.000> and<00:01:46.979> one<00:01:47.979> at<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:48.190> very<00:01:48.369> top

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
like two layers and one at the very top

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.040 
like two layers and one at the very top
when<00:01:50.080> you<00:01:50.200> go<00:01:50.320> when<00:01:50.860> you<00:01:50.979> put<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:52.540> bad<00:01:52.720> side

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
when you go when you put the bad side

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:59.249 
when you go when you put the bad side
when<00:01:54.009> you<00:01:54.159> squeeze<00:01:54.490> the<00:01:54.759> extruder<00:01:58.080> comes<00:01:59.080> out

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
when you squeeze the extruder comes out

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.999 
when you squeeze the extruder comes out
here<00:01:59.979> so<00:02:00.220> it<00:02:00.310> depends<00:02:00.610> on<00:02:00.670> how<00:02:01.530> long<00:02:02.530> you<00:02:02.890> would

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
here so it depends on how long you would

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.930 
here so it depends on how long you would
want<00:02:03.220> to<00:02:03.280> hear<00:02:03.670> oh<00:02:04.050> that's<00:02:05.050> pretty<00:02:05.259> good

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
want to hear oh that's pretty good

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:13.470 
want to hear oh that's pretty good
all<00:02:06.940> right<00:02:07.090> so<00:02:07.330> I<00:02:10.950> only<00:02:11.950> use<00:02:12.100> like<00:02:12.400> half<00:02:12.730> slice

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
all right so I only use like half slice

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.240 
all right so I only use like half slice
half<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:16.120> then<00:02:16.450> usually<00:02:17.350> thumbs<00:02:17.920> it<00:02:18.100> like

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
half and then usually thumbs it like

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.820 
half and then usually thumbs it like
this<00:02:18.630> no<00:02:19.630> clunk<00:02:20.310> like<00:02:21.310> this<00:02:22.500> looks<00:02:23.500> weird

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
this no clunk like this looks weird

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.280 
this no clunk like this looks weird
there<00:02:24.190> but<00:02:24.430> let's<00:02:24.640> put<00:02:24.910> that<00:02:25.060> in<00:02:25.300> on<00:02:26.050> the<00:02:26.140> one

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
there but let's put that in on the one

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:33.840 
there but let's put that in on the one
side<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.980> our<00:02:30.160> imaginary<00:02:30.760> line<00:02:32.579> if<00:02:33.579> you<00:02:33.760> want

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
side of our imaginary line if you want

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:43.520 
side of our imaginary line if you want
to<00:02:34.000> straighten<00:02:34.329> it<00:02:34.480> a<00:02:34.570> bit<00:02:35.820> and<00:02:36.820> do<00:02:36.970> it<00:02:37.090> here

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.940 

you<00:02:43.890> can<00:02:44.010> see<00:02:44.190> that<00:02:44.780> all<00:02:45.780> right<00:02:45.960> in<00:02:46.770> the

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
you can see that all right in the

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.380 
you can see that all right in the
interest<00:02:47.280> of<00:02:47.400> time<00:02:47.550> let<00:02:47.820> me<00:02:47.850> do<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.210> whole

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
interest of time let me do the whole

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.790 
interest of time let me do the whole
line<00:02:48.660> all<00:02:49.560> right

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
line all right

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.330 
line all right
using<00:02:50.760> this<00:02:51.740> technique<00:02:52.740> and<00:02:52.950> I'll<00:02:53.070> show<00:02:53.280> you

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
using this technique and I'll show you

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.420 
using this technique and I'll show you
the<00:02:53.580> finished<00:02:54.030> product<00:02:54.270> for<00:02:54.720> that<00:02:55.080> line<00:02:55.430> all

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
the finished product for that line all

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.930 
the finished product for that line all
right<00:02:56.490> so<00:02:56.730> I'm<00:02:56.880> done<00:02:58.310> doing<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.550> first<00:02:59.790> part

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
right so I'm done doing the first part

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.630 
right so I'm done doing the first part
see<00:03:00.780> how<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:00.960> looks

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
see how it looks

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.600 
see how it looks
so<00:03:02.640> it's<00:03:03.510> nighttime<00:03:03.810> here<00:03:04.080> so<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:05.400> lights

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
so it's nighttime here so the lights

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:12.370 
so it's nighttime here so the lights
aren't<00:03:05.850> really<00:03:06.150> helping<00:03:06.300> us<00:03:07.610> but<00:03:08.610> I<00:03:09.180> see<00:03:09.660> that

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.590 

all<00:03:13.380> right<00:03:13.590> now<00:03:14.370> let<00:03:14.580> me<00:03:14.610> do<00:03:14.880> an<00:03:15.000> imaginary

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
all right now let me do an imaginary

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.210 
all right now let me do an imaginary
line<00:03:15.750> here<00:03:17.150> that<00:03:18.150> would<00:03:18.300> cover<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.750> base<00:03:19.740> for

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
line here that would cover the base for
