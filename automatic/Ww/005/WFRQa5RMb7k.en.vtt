00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
now I'm used to driving around in the

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.670 
now I'm used to driving around in the
snow<00:00:05.580> and<00:00:06.060> icy<00:00:06.420> conditions<00:00:06.569> and<00:00:07.080> pretty<00:00:07.290> cold

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
snow and icy conditions and pretty cold

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.500 
snow and icy conditions and pretty cold
temperatures<00:00:08.250> because<00:00:08.519> it's<00:00:08.639> my<00:00:08.760> job<00:00:08.790> but

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
temperatures because it's my job but

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.089 
temperatures because it's my job but
most<00:00:09.719> of<00:00:09.809> you<00:00:09.929> won't<00:00:10.050> be<00:00:10.230> used<00:00:10.410> to<00:00:10.530> that<00:00:10.679> so

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
most of you won't be used to that so

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.580 
most of you won't be used to that so
here<00:00:11.309> are<00:00:11.400> my<00:00:11.429> top<00:00:11.580> winter<00:00:12.330> driving<00:00:12.540> tips<00:00:12.750> the

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
here are my top winter driving tips the

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.620 
here are my top winter driving tips the
first<00:00:13.830> thing<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.219> do<00:00:14.370> is<00:00:14.549> clear<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:14.880> snow<00:00:15.089> and

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
first thing to do is clear the snow and

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.570 
first thing to do is clear the snow and
ice<00:00:15.780> from<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:16.080> vehicle<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:16.770> know<00:00:17.310> it's

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
ice from the vehicle I know it's

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.710 
ice from the vehicle I know it's
tempting<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:18.000> just<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.330> clear<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.539> windscreen

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
tempting to just to clear the windscreen

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.019 
tempting to just to clear the windscreen
but<00:00:19.590> having<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.890> dumb<00:00:20.100> person<00:00:20.250> on<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.640> roof<00:00:20.820> is

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
but having a dumb person on the roof is

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.179 
but having a dumb person on the roof is
a<00:00:21.090> real<00:00:21.480> hazard<00:00:21.750> for<00:00:22.050> both<00:00:22.230> you<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.710> other

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
a real hazard for both you and other

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.360 

now<00:00:36.039> let's<00:00:36.340> check<00:00:36.579> the<00:00:36.730> lights<00:00:37.000> and<00:00:37.329> tired<00:00:37.809> you

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
now let's check the lights and tired you

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.799 
now let's check the lights and tired you
may<00:00:39.370> need<00:00:39.610> the<00:00:39.760> assistance<00:00:39.969> of<00:00:40.300> someone<00:00:40.510> else

may need the assistance of someone else

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:42.600 
may need the assistance of someone else
to<00:00:40.989> check<00:00:41.199> your<00:00:41.320> brake<00:00:41.559> lights<00:00:41.590> but<00:00:42.399> it<00:00:42.519> is

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
to check your brake lights but it is

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.090 
to check your brake lights but it is
essential<00:00:43.149> that<00:00:43.180> your<00:00:43.390> lights<00:00:43.660> are<00:00:43.870> working

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
essential that your lights are working

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.500 
essential that your lights are working
especially<00:00:45.100> in<00:00:45.219> bad<00:00:45.399> weather<00:00:45.579> and<00:00:45.940> don't

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
especially in bad weather and don't

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.229 
especially in bad weather and don't
forget<00:00:46.629> your<00:00:46.839> fog<00:00:47.019> lights<00:00:47.230> too<00:00:47.820> tires<00:00:48.820> need<00:00:49.120> to

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
forget your fog lights too tires need to

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:50.939 
forget your fog lights too tires need to
be<00:00:49.329> at<00:00:49.420> the<00:00:49.510> correct<00:00:49.690> pressure<00:00:50.019> and<00:00:50.350> check<00:00:50.800> the

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949 
be at the correct pressure and check the

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:53.069 
be at the correct pressure and check the
tread<00:00:51.190> depth<00:00:51.549> bald<00:00:52.180> tires<00:00:52.479> are<00:00:52.719> not<00:00:52.870> only

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
tread depth bald tires are not only

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:54.869 
tread depth bald tires are not only
illegal<00:00:53.350> they're<00:00:53.799> potentially<00:00:54.309> lethal<00:00:54.519> as

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
illegal they're potentially lethal as

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:56.399 
illegal they're potentially lethal as
the<00:00:55.120> vehicle<00:00:55.540> will<00:00:55.659> not<00:00:55.839> be<00:00:55.989> able<00:00:56.079> to<00:00:56.229> maintain

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:56.409 
the vehicle will not be able to maintain

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:59.039 
the vehicle will not be able to maintain
sufficient<00:00:56.860> traction<00:00:57.549> with<00:00:57.699> the<00:00:57.820> road<00:00:58.049> next

00:00:59.039 --> 00:00:59.049 
sufficient traction with the road next

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:01.079 
sufficient traction with the road next
it's<00:00:59.199> time<00:00:59.290> to<00:00:59.559> check<00:00:59.710> your<00:00:59.860> fluids<00:01:00.129> or<00:01:00.850> your

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
it's time to check your fluids or your

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:02.969 
it's time to check your fluids or your
levels<00:01:01.449> are<00:01:01.570> essential<00:01:02.110> but<00:01:02.649> so<00:01:02.829> is

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:02.979 
levels are essential but so is

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:05.310 
levels are essential but so is
antifreeze<00:01:03.399> washer<00:01:04.330> fluid<00:01:04.449> and<00:01:04.839> of<00:01:05.289> course

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
antifreeze washer fluid and of course

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.880 
antifreeze washer fluid and of course
making<00:01:05.860> sure<00:01:06.100> you<00:01:06.250> have<00:01:06.340> enough<00:01:06.520> fuel<00:01:07.830> ok<00:01:08.830> so

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
making sure you have enough fuel ok so

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.320 
making sure you have enough fuel ok so
that's<00:01:09.190> all<00:01:09.340> the<00:01:09.369> checks<00:01:09.670> was<00:01:09.850> for<00:01:10.000> setting

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
that's all the checks was for setting

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.359 
that's all the checks was for setting
off<00:01:10.479> but<00:01:10.960> what<00:01:11.080> about<00:01:11.110> driving<00:01:11.590> there<00:01:12.250> are

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
off but what about driving there are

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:14.639 
off but what about driving there are
tuning<00:01:12.700> to<00:01:12.820> remember<00:01:13.149> here<00:01:13.330> to<00:01:13.539> always<00:01:14.409> use

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 
tuning to remember here to always use

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:16.830 
tuning to remember here to always use
the<00:01:14.679> highest<00:01:15.220> practical<00:01:15.759> gear<00:01:16.000> so<00:01:16.600> get<00:01:16.810> up

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
the highest practical gear so get up

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.840 
the highest practical gear so get up
into<00:01:17.140> third<00:01:17.500> or<00:01:17.740> fourth<00:01:18.039> when<00:01:18.250> driving<00:01:18.580> is

into third or fourth when driving is

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.580 
into third or fourth when driving is
this<00:01:19.179> limits<00:01:19.569> the<00:01:19.630> amount<00:01:19.780> of<00:01:20.020> torque<00:01:20.350> and

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
this limits the amount of torque and

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.830 
this limits the amount of torque and

descending a hill in which case you want

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:26.700 
descending a hill in which case you want
to<00:01:24.819> use<00:01:24.970> the<00:01:25.119> lowest<00:01:25.450> practical<00:01:25.960> gear<00:01:26.170> to

wheels from locking up it may sound
obvious<00:01:36.759> but<00:01:37.000> you<00:01:37.299> must<00:01:37.569> leave<00:01:37.750> extra

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110
