00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
what are these sensitivity wheel

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.800 
what are these sensitivity wheel
adjustments<00:02:49.370> do<00:02:49.549> we're<00:02:50.209> going<00:02:50.299> to<00:02:50.359> show<00:02:50.569> you

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.690 

this<00:02:53.810> is<00:02:53.989> a<00:02:54.019> touch<00:02:54.290> sensitive<00:02:54.680> jog<00:02:55.040> wheel<00:02:55.280> as

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
this is a touch sensitive jog wheel as

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.149 
this is a touch sensitive jog wheel as
you<00:02:55.819> can<00:02:55.909> see<00:02:56.030> here<00:02:56.180> it's<00:02:56.269> blue<00:02:56.569> I<00:02:56.889> can<00:02:57.889> use<00:02:58.010> the

00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.159 
you can see here it's blue I can use the

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:59.559 
you can see here it's blue I can use the
outside<00:02:58.579> ring<00:02:58.849> you<00:02:59.000> can<00:02:59.120> hear<00:02:59.269> it<00:02:59.359> slowing

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
outside ring you can hear it slowing

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:00.069 
outside ring you can hear it slowing
down

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:00.079 
down

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:05.050 
down
I<00:03:02.949> got<00:03:03.949> you<00:03:04.069> turn<00:03:04.250> off<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:04.489> scratch<00:03:04.730> from<00:03:04.939> over

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
I got you turn off the scratch from over

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:12.429 
I got you turn off the scratch from over
the<00:03:05.150> whole<00:03:05.299> jog<00:03:05.540> wheel<00:03:05.750> becomes<00:03:06.079> that<00:03:11.439> very

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:12.439 
the whole jog wheel becomes that very

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:14.860 
the whole jog wheel becomes that very
similar<00:03:12.889> to<00:03:13.040> the<00:03:13.129> CDJ<00:03:13.639> lines<00:03:13.969> where<00:03:14.569> they<00:03:14.689> have

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
similar to the CDJ lines where they have

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.959 
similar to the CDJ lines where they have
the<00:03:15.260> final<00:03:15.650> mode<00:03:15.829> and<00:03:16.099> then<00:03:16.189> the<00:03:16.280> CDJ<00:03:16.760> mode

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:16.969 
the final mode and then the CDJ mode

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:18.699 
the final mode and then the CDJ mode
where<00:03:17.180> you<00:03:17.239> can<00:03:17.269> bend<00:03:17.599> with<00:03:17.719> the<00:03:17.750> jog<00:03:18.019> wheel<00:03:18.230> so

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
where you can bend with the jog wheel so

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.770 
where you can bend with the jog wheel so
we'll<00:03:18.829> put<00:03:18.949> the<00:03:19.069> scratch<00:03:19.310> back<00:03:19.579> on<00:03:19.790> and<00:03:20.269> you

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
we'll put the scratch back on and you

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.659 
we'll put the scratch back on and you
can<00:03:20.930> see<00:03:21.109> when<00:03:21.500> I<00:03:21.530> put<00:03:21.889> pressure<00:03:22.099> down<00:03:22.489> on<00:03:22.519> the

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:22.669 
can see when I put pressure down on the

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:29.020 
can see when I put pressure down on the
top<00:03:22.849> of<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:23.060> platter<00:03:23.299> the<00:03:23.750> platter<00:03:23.989> turns<00:03:24.260> red

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.060 

so<00:03:30.020> where<00:03:30.170> does<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:30.320> sensitivity<00:03:30.950> of<00:03:31.040> that

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
so where does the sensitivity of that

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.730 
so where does the sensitivity of that
jogwheel<00:03:31.370> come<00:03:31.760> in<00:03:32.110> grab<00:03:33.110> the<00:03:33.140> knob<00:03:33.380> for<00:03:33.590> this

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
jogwheel come in grab the knob for this

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.920 
jogwheel come in grab the knob for this
deck<00:03:34.010> you<00:03:34.370> can<00:03:34.400> actually<00:03:34.820> turn<00:03:34.970> it<00:03:35.180> so<00:03:35.720> high

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
deck you can actually turn it so high

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.890 
deck you can actually turn it so high
that<00:03:36.760> it's<00:03:37.760> now<00:03:37.940> basically<00:03:38.210> locked<00:03:38.600> the<00:03:38.720> deck

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
that it's now basically locked the deck

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.120 
that it's now basically locked the deck
because<00:03:39.200> it<00:03:39.320> feels<00:03:39.500> like<00:03:39.620> there's<00:03:39.860> pressure

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
because it feels like there's pressure

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.190 
because it feels like there's pressure
applied<00:03:40.400> to<00:03:40.520> it<00:03:40.880> we'll<00:03:41.810> make<00:03:41.930> that<00:03:41.990> adjustment

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
applied to it we'll make that adjustment

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.400 
applied to it we'll make that adjustment
to<00:03:42.740> let<00:03:42.890> it<00:03:43.010> go<00:03:43.180> and<00:03:44.180> for<00:03:45.140> the<00:03:45.200> environment

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
to let it go and for the environment

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.050 
to let it go and for the environment
that<00:03:45.770> we're<00:03:45.890> in<00:03:45.920> right<00:03:46.130> now<00:03:46.190> this<00:03:46.580> is<00:03:46.760> probably

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
that we're in right now this is probably

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.699 
that we're in right now this is probably
the<00:03:47.209> most<00:03:47.240> sensitive<00:03:47.600> this<00:03:47.990> platter<00:03:48.260> can<00:03:48.530> be

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
the most sensitive this platter can be

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.560 
the most sensitive this platter can be
and<00:03:48.980> it's<00:03:49.580> going<00:03:49.700> to<00:03:49.790> be<00:03:49.880> just<00:03:50.060> a<00:03:50.180> whisper

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
and it's going to be just a whisper

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.390 
and it's going to be just a whisper
touch<00:03:52.870> my<00:03:53.870> fingers<00:03:54.200> are<00:03:54.320> barely<00:03:54.530> resting<00:03:55.310> on

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
touch my fingers are barely resting on

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:02.020 
touch my fingers are barely resting on
top<00:03:55.550> of<00:03:55.760> that<00:04:00.459> you<00:04:01.459> can<00:04:01.520> turn<00:04:01.850> that

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
top of that you can turn that

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.790 
top of that you can turn that
sensitivity<00:04:02.450> up<00:04:02.780> so<00:04:03.050> it<00:04:03.140> actually<00:04:03.260> requires<00:04:03.680> a

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
sensitivity up so it actually requires a

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.640 
sensitivity up so it actually requires a
little<00:04:03.980> more<00:04:04.100> pressure

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.229 

turn<00:04:09.650> it<00:04:09.739> up<00:04:09.830> even<00:04:10.070> farther<00:04:10.370> and<00:04:10.730> you<00:04:11.090> can

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
turn it up even farther and you can

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:12.910 
turn it up even farther and you can
actually<00:04:11.390> use<00:04:11.660> the<00:04:11.780> top<00:04:11.959> of<00:04:12.110> the<00:04:12.170> jogwheel<00:04:12.410> to

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
actually use the top of the jogwheel to

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.250 
actually use the top of the jogwheel to
do<00:04:13.040> bending<00:04:13.400> as<00:04:14.360> you<00:04:14.600> would<00:04:14.750> on<00:04:14.780> the<00:04:14.870> outside

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
do bending as you would on the outside

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.740 
do bending as you would on the outside
see<00:04:15.470> how<00:04:15.530> it's<00:04:15.709> still<00:04:15.980> blue<00:04:16.419> push<00:04:17.419> even<00:04:17.570> harder

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
see how it's still blue push even harder

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:26.200 
see how it's still blue push even harder
