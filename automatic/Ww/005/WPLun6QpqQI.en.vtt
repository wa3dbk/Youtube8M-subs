guys to read but pretty much i'm going
to<00:00:15.660> break<00:00:15.870> down<00:00:16.139> each<00:00:16.470> section<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.550> tell<00:00:17.760> you

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
to break down each section and tell you

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.870 
to break down each section and tell you
what<00:00:18.029> each<00:00:18.210> section<00:00:18.449> means<00:00:19.580> so<00:00:20.580> pretty<00:00:20.760> much

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
what each section means so pretty much

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.970 
what each section means so pretty much
the<00:00:21.090> first<00:00:21.119> paragraph<00:00:22.020> in<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.380> article<00:00:22.800> is

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
the first paragraph in the article is

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.590 
the first paragraph in the article is
saying<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.430> dough<00:00:23.640> rise<00:00:23.670> is<00:00:24.150> based<00:00:24.390> in

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
saying the dough rise is based in

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.660 
saying the dough rise is based in
skyscraper<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:26.039> is<00:00:26.160> very<00:00:26.220> claustrophobic

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
skyscraper and it is very claustrophobic

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.750 
skyscraper and it is very claustrophobic
so<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.750> mainly<00:00:27.960> consists<00:00:28.710> of<00:00:28.859> tight<00:00:29.189> hallways

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
so it mainly consists of tight hallways

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.240 
so it mainly consists of tight hallways
and<00:00:30.060> arm<00:00:30.630> certain<00:00:31.080> holes<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.619> broken<00:00:32.009> stuff

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
and arm certain holes and broken stuff

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.100 
and arm certain holes and broken stuff
that<00:00:32.460> zombies<00:00:32.790> can<00:00:32.940> jump<00:00:33.180> from<00:00:33.329> above<00:00:33.630> so

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
that zombies can jump from above so

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.299 
that zombies can jump from above so
they're<00:00:34.290> probably<00:00:34.320> going<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.770> be<00:00:34.860> flanking<00:00:35.219> us

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
they're probably going to be flanking us

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.040 
they're probably going to be flanking us
from<00:00:35.520> all<00:00:35.640> different<00:00:35.850> directions<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.660> it's

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
from all different directions and it's

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.280 
from all different directions and it's
mainly<00:00:37.380> going<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.860> be<00:00:37.980> close<00:00:38.219> quarters<00:00:39.290> it

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
mainly going to be close quarters it

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.720 
mainly going to be close quarters it
also<00:00:40.440> says<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.890> can<00:00:41.010> use<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.280> elevator<00:00:41.670> to

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
also says you can use the elevator to

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.209 
also says you can use the elevator to
move<00:00:42.059> around<00:00:42.210> through<00:00:42.960> doing<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:43.590> can<00:00:44.160> be

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
move around through doing so can be

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.160 
move around through doing so can be
risky<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.879> usually<00:00:45.210> pieces<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.840> building

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
risky and usually pieces of the building

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.510 
risky and usually pieces of the building
break<00:00:46.379> in<00:00:46.530> such<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.770> way<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.219> can<00:00:47.340> move

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
break in such a way that you can move

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.700 
break in such a way that you can move
between<00:00:47.670> sections<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.200> might<00:00:49.410> mean<00:00:49.649> that

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
between sections so this might mean that

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.549 
between sections so this might mean that
the<00:00:50.039> actual<00:00:50.340> map<00:00:50.610> changes<00:00:51.270> possibly<00:00:52.170> after<00:00:52.379> a

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
the actual map changes possibly after a

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.200 
the actual map changes possibly after a
certain<00:00:52.800> amount<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:53.129> time<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.579> can<00:00:54.090> be

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
certain amount of time and can be

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.910 
certain amount of time and can be
manipulated<00:00:54.930> by<00:00:54.960> certain<00:00:55.379> things<00:00:55.649> I'm<00:00:55.860> not

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
manipulated by certain things I'm not

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.770 
manipulated by certain things I'm not
sure<00:00:56.520> how<00:00:56.670> it's<00:00:56.820> going<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:56.969> work<00:00:57.059> but<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.539> may

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
sure how it's going to work but that may

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.410 
sure how it's going to work but that may
be<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:58.020> possibility<00:00:58.699> so<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.879> next<00:00:59.910> bit<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.300> the

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
be a possibility so the next bit of the

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.240 
be a possibility so the next bit of the
article<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.930> caught<00:01:01.109> my<00:01:01.320> eye<00:01:01.350> was<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:02.010> third

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.560 
and the denizens if you don't know what
a<00:01:35.070> dens<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.549> I'll<00:01:35.700> put<00:01:35.909> one<00:01:36.060> up<00:01:36.180> on<00:01:36.329> screen

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
a dens and is I'll put one up on screen

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.090 
a dens and is I'll put one up on screen
so<00:01:37.200> they're<00:01:37.350> probably<00:01:37.619> going<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.920> look<00:01:38.070> like

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
so they're probably going to look like

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.080 
so they're probably going to look like
this<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.549> they're<00:01:38.670> just<00:01:38.729> going<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:38.970> be

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
this and they're just going to be

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.819 
this and they're just going to be
teleporting<00:01:39.689> everywhere<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.560> think

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
teleporting everywhere and I think

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:41.840 
teleporting everywhere and I think
they're<00:01:40.950> just<00:01:41.100> going<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.310> be<00:01:41.400> annoying<00:01:41.670> the

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850
