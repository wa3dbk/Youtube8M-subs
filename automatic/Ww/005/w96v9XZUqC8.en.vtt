 how to make lemon sorbet can you 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.290
 combine different fruits and juices to 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.719
 Create your own taste of sorbet 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.969
 sorbets are very refreshing and just 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.220
 they require two ingredients so it is 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.590
 a simple summer dessert that 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.260
 You can easily make lemon home 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.300
 acid from sweet and juicy strawberries 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.340
 peaches are just some of the 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.670
 most common fruits that can be 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.550
 use for a sorbet either alone or 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.800
 in combination the creamy texture does not 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.510
 comes from dairy products but to 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.000
 from the sugar content of the 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.969
 sorbet and sugar combined with 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.250
 air beaten in the mixture prevents the 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.739
 development of ice crystals in a 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.480
 hard block the ice creams are loaded 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.820
 of fat eggs and other ingredients 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.809
 to help achieve a smooth texture and 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.910
 creamy 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.620
 but frozen sorbets can 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.140
 be as rich without those 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.600
 ingredients a sorbet well done by 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.190
 example has a delicate texture but 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.440
 It is also lighter and more 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.840
 refreshing most sherbets 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.470
 they are simply made with water fruit 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.540
 and sugar 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.200
 the sugar acts as an antifreeze 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.000
 for 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.979
 keep the soft fruit 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.259
 professionals use test equipment 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.539
 of high technology to obtain the 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.759
 correct proportions but you can 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:23.189
 get with some simple techniques 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.819
 to make a lemon sorbet 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:30.450
 you will need fruit or fruit juice sugar 

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:33.090
 and ice cream machine peels and removes 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.490
 the seeds of fruit bones or 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.799
 berries that you have chosen make a puree with 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.200
 the fruit in a processor blender 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.720
 food pushes the puree through a colander 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.360
 fine mesh if you wish to remove 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.670
 the lumps the pieces of skin that you 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.689
 have overlooked and the fibers of your 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.789
 mashed potatoes 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.159
 this step is optional but you can give it 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:56.099
 to your puree a better texture depending 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.829
 what fruit and berries you have chosen with 

00:01:56.099 --> 00:02:00.899
 the puree strained in a bowl and add a 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.229
 part of common sugar for every four 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.450
 mashed fruit parts may vary 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.060
 widely in sweetness but this 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.579
 proportion of four to one ensures that 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.280
 there is enough sugar in the mixture to 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:14.639
 produce a soft texture sorbet 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.069
 fine 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:19.739
 mix well until the sugar is 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.769
 come back completely test the mixture and 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.389
 adjust flavors as needed 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.760
 add a little more sugar if it is 

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:29.099
 too sour for your taste or a 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.799
 trickle of lemon juice or lime if it is 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:34.769
 sweeter than you would like 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:37.319
 Mix for an hour or more if the 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.930
 time allows it the colder it is 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.689
 the mash more quickly and more 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.389
 uniform will freeze pour the mixture 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:48.120
 already chilled sorbet in your machine 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:50.459

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.739
 that the sorbet has frozen until 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.290
 get a smooth consistency for 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.659
 serve can be served at this stage or 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.419
 pack it in airtight containers and 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:02.519
 Save in the freezer with this method 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:05.150
