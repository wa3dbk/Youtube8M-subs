00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.820
 the sum is the center of life on earth 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.820
 the life of reptiles is also focused on them 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:15.409
 Therefore, it is important to adjust the sun as much as possible in the terrarium 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.860
 the painting Part 3 show 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.130
 is the first such load 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.419
 which really meets the needs of the animals 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:27.800
 this revolutionary bulb 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.410
 The sauna has been modeled and offers everything reptiles need 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.659
 thermal radiation 

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:35.870
 Call on nature and shout on him 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.870
 as much light 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.990
 the peculiarity of this farmer combined with the high light output 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.040
 healthy uv or and and VW radiation 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.790
 As the only Aten lamp it achieves sun-like light intensities 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.140
 the lamp increases the well-being of the animals 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.940
 The animals show more brilliant colors and are more active 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.490
 the goethe and mating behavior is also positively influenced 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.230
 In addition, it is extremely economical 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.300
 so they can already have a 160 watt bypass spot with a 70 watts 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.320
 replace 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.650
 That saves a good 70 euros in electricity costs a year 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.710
 and the animals benefit from five times more light at the same time 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.370
 as already on the slopes in two variants 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.760
 already at the Hofer or pages for the highest and steppe inhabitants and 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.460
 Already suspected trade for forest dwellers as through 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.460
 distinguish different light colors 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.060
 They can also spot the quality of light and brightness of the lamp 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.140
 to convince 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.690
 the dealer considers it special he is looking arias ready

 for the operation of the Brit Sam are special ballasts and sockets 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.210
 required 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.860

 Boos Roar performance 

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:43.109
 and VW radiation the right wavelength range 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:46.979
 good heat output 

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:49.059
 very high light output 

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:54.679
 optimally tuned spectrums riding sand long BLE for forest dwellers Brit Sam 

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:57.269
 Bell himself for desert steppe
