00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:07.550
 uber because wrote an article 

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:12.110
 who called the eternal fascist in her he 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:16.609
 calls 14 signs of fascism another 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:20.539
 scientist breed also analyzed fascism 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:25.159
 also called 14 signs of fascism however 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:28.119
 no they do not coincide with each other and 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:31.300
 Essentially it turns out so 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:34.780
 fascism as a social phenomenon 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:38.690
 He eluded the understanding of both 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:41.269
 just for the simple reason that fascism 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.239
 many faces and answer the question what is it 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:47.890
 it is without certainty that 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:52.480
 such a person is normal impossible 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:55.820
 the most common definition of fascism 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:01:00.070
 This statement about the fact that fascism is 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:02.749
 misanthropy system but 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.630
 specifics are obtained 

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:08.650
 different when detailing this answer in 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:13.310
 whichever we understand by 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:15.850
 the essence of man and accordingly 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.580
 so you set out in previous lectures 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:23.690
 then misanthropism fascism 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:27.170
 expressed in that person as 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.880
 carrier of the humane system of the psyche with 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.020
 Fascist point of view 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.660
 the phenomenon of antisocial and the essence of fascism in 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.000
 that this culture 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:40.700
 aimed at ensuring that society 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.180
 which all reach the human type 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.650
 building the psyche to the beginning of adolescence is not 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.470
 took place 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:51.290
 but there is also liberalism and liberals 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.540
 believe that they are anti-fascists and fascists 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:02:01.130
 all others but who do not agree with 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:03.830
 liberals are the real such that the essence 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.190
 liberalism is that in answering the question 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.789
 what is a person normally says that 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.170
 norms per se not 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:15.620
 and the norm is unlimited diversity 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.000
 there is nothing but unlimited 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.390
 legislation which is aimed at 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 protecting this infinite variety 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.000
 from the encroachments of all totalitarianism 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:34.220
 Well, it would seem possible to agree 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.569
 however, there are a number of related 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:42.120
 circumstances in life exist 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:46.769
 developmental processes degradation processes 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:49.590
 development and degradation are distinguishable only in 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:55.370
 if there is any 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:03:01.409
 idea of ​​what is normal if 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:05.790
 the reality is that society is far from 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:10.129
 norms then development is a change of society 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.689
 towards the norm from degradation this 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:19.819
 further care 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:22.979
 society from the norm and accordingly if 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:26.669
 the concept of norms is mistaken 

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:29.909
 but, no less informatively creative 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:33.449
 the potential is not blocked then in the process 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:36.180
 development of society will come to the right 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:40.790
 understanding of the norm the norm will be implemented 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:43.260
 brought to life and if there is 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.109
 fundamental reluctance to respond to 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.780
 the question is what is a normal person and 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:54.169
 hide behind the infinite varied 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.169
 then in this infinite variety 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:59.909
 there is a place and degradation processes 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:02.939
 the development process is it in general 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:05.750
 it turns out so rolls downhill 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:08.459
 always easier than scrambling 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.599
 degradation processes and that in general that 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:15.810
 a rolling selection 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:17.739
 so it turns out that liberalism 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.049
 This kind of fascism 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.960
 in the sense that liberalism 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:27.090
 prevent the formation of human 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:30.280
 cultures not holding back any 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:35.050
 totalitarian development people development 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:38.009
 society and the rejection of the norm of understanding 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.479
 the fact that such a person is normal 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:43.000
 opens the broadest gate 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:43.599
 degradation process as a result 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.800
 what 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:50.800
 society eventually rolls into 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.870
 the process of biological degeneration has 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.500
 perspectives and finish your 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:59.430
 existence giving way to habitat 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:02.199
 another society carrier of another culture 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:05.319
 that's what's happening now 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:10.120
 united states in europe it is just 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:16.139
 and that's what I said, that is 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:18.630
 liberalism opens the widest gates 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:22.060
 penetration into society of degradation 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:24.449
 processes but this process is not wearing 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:28.030
 spontaneous character but purposefully 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:31.659
 driven for the simple reason that 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:34.870
 for those who are taken sometimes called 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:37.659
 world backstage liberally bourgeois 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:40.960
 capitalism society is liberal based 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:43.270
 seems like a danger because 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.289
 he is the race generator 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:48.819
 consumption without meaning her pulse and 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:50.880
 according to the global generator 

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:54.060
 biosphere ecological crisis 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:57.539
 which is developing towards 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:06:00.539
 total destruction now existing 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:00.539
 biosphere
