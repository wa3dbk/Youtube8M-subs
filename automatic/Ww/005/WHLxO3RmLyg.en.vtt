00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.660 
no way that's happening for me but this
is<00:03:41.980> ten<00:03:42.190> percent<00:03:42.550> of<00:03:43.170> production<00:03:44.170> no<00:03:44.290> 25<00:03:44.710> so

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
is ten percent of production no 25 so

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:46.890 
is ten percent of production no 25 so
this<00:03:45.820> is<00:03:45.850> only<00:03:46.060> ten<00:03:46.270> percent<00:03:46.390> of<00:03:46.570> production

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
this is only ten percent of production

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.750 
this is only ten percent of production
in<00:03:46.990> the<00:03:47.080> gold<00:03:47.290> so<00:03:48.010> it's<00:03:48.190> really<00:03:48.430> an<00:03:48.610> end

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
in the gold so it's really an end

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.370 
in the gold so it's really an end

whatever<00:04:31.929> if<00:04:32.110> it<00:04:32.289> fails<00:04:32.439> it's<00:04:32.739> gold<00:04:35.039> so<00:04:36.039> I<00:04:36.069> was

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:36.369 
whatever if it fails it's gold so I was

00:04:36.369 --> 00:04:38.549 
whatever if it fails it's gold so I was
sending<00:04:36.669> them<00:04:36.999> unit<00:04:37.509> down<00:04:37.689> to<00:04:37.869> venice<00:04:38.019> and

like<00:04:58.390> tell<00:04:58.630> them<00:04:58.660> what<00:04:58.900> to<00:04:59.020> build<00:05:00.840> so<00:05:01.840> we're

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
like tell them what to build so we're

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.020 
like tell them what to build so we're
taking<00:05:02.320> this<00:05:02.440> seriously<00:05:03.040> I<00:05:03.430> would<00:05:03.580> probably

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
taking this seriously I would probably

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.570 
taking this seriously I would probably
need<00:05:04.180> to<00:05:04.240> be<00:05:05.110> my<00:05:05.560> crowing<00:05:05.860> my<00:05:05.980> workers<00:05:06.370> and

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
need to be my crowing my workers and

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:37.320 

there<00:05:14.500> we<00:05:14.590> go<00:05:33.810> how<00:05:34.810> much<00:05:34.960> is<00:05:35.110> it<00:05:35.230> to<00:05:35.320> upgrade<00:05:36.330> no

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
there we go how much is it to upgrade no

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.730 
there we go how much is it to upgrade no
oh<00:05:38.820> that's<00:05:39.820> not<00:05:40.000> too<00:05:40.090> bad<00:05:40.120> at<00:05:40.420> all<00:05:40.740> the

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
oh that's not too bad at all the

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.260 
oh that's not too bad at all the
upgrades<00:05:41.890> are<00:05:42.220> much<00:05:42.430> less<00:05:42.610> prohibitive<00:05:43.180> in

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
upgrades are much less prohibitive in

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.490 
upgrades are much less prohibitive in
this<00:05:43.420> game<00:05:43.600> than<00:05:43.780> they<00:05:43.870> were<00:05:43.930> in<00:05:44.020> the<00:05:44.200> previous

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
this game than they were in the previous

00:05:44.500 --> 00:06:02.910 
this game than they were in the previous
one<00:05:51.450> night<00:05:52.450> night<00:05:54.000> no<00:06:01.530> trying<00:06:02.530> to<00:06:02.620> select<00:06:02.770> the

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:02.920 
one night night no trying to select the

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:39.100 
one night night no trying to select the
horsemen<00:06:03.250> Aereo<00:06:04.530> awesome<00:06:16.140> there<00:06:17.140> we<00:06:17.260> go

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:39.110 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:46.339 

zero<00:06:40.110> proximate<00:06:40.710> damage<00:06:41.069> inflicted<00:06:44.750> are<00:06:45.750> nice

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:46.349 
zero proximate damage inflicted are nice

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:48.050 
zero proximate damage inflicted are nice
slower<00:06:46.710> yeah<00:06:47.039> they<00:06:47.220> are<00:06:47.370> that's<00:06:47.729> unfortunate

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060 
slower yeah they are that's unfortunate

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.029 
slower yeah they are that's unfortunate
so<00:06:49.050> they're<00:06:49.169> not<00:06:49.259> slower<00:06:49.560> than<00:06:49.710> my<00:06:49.860> great

00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:50.039 
so they're not slower than my great
