00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:06.312
 Hello I'm Francis 

00:00:06.312 --> 00:00:08.826
 the host of this show 'Cooking with Dog'. 

00:00:17.262 --> 00:00:19.598
 Prepare the vegetables. 

00:00:19.598 --> 00:00:24.294
 Use the outer skirts of the onion to make the dish look nicer. 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.116
 Cut the onion into pieces of 1.3 cm 

00:00:30.074 --> 00:00:32.381
 and cut these pieces in half. 

00:00:34.593 --> 00:00:38.929
 Cut the cross-thistle mushroom in two. 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.728
 Cut it lengthwise and then into pieces of 0.6 centimeters. 

00:00:49.173 --> 00:00:52.404
 Cut the salad leaves in half lengthwise 

00:00:53.896 --> 00:00:56.976
 and then chop into strips of 1.3 centimeters wide. 

00:00:59.643 --> 00:01:02.797
 Now wok the vegetables. 

00:01:03.207 --> 00:01:05.707
 Heat the olive oil in a pan. 

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:14.506
 Add the onion and the oyster mushroom and mix so that they are covered with the oil. 

00:01:17.303 --> 00:01:19.187
 Sprinkle with salt 

00:01:22.538 --> 00:01:24.841
 and brown the vegetables. 

00:01:29.274 --> 00:01:32.080
 Finally sprinkle with pepper, 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.875
 turn off the heat 

00:01:36.288 --> 00:01:38.883
 and put the vegetables on a plate. 

00:01:47.085 --> 00:01:50.474
 Season one side of the steak with salt 

00:01:53.824 --> 00:01:54.953
 and pepper. 

00:01:56.172 --> 00:01:58.114
 Turn on the fire 

00:02:00.473 --> 00:02:03.410
 and heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. 

00:02:06.775 --> 00:02:11.491
 Place the steak in the pan with the seasoned side down. 

00:02:14.111 --> 00:02:18.379
 Shake the pan now and then to brown the steak. 

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:23.630
 Check the underside of the steak with tongs. 

00:02:26.706 --> 00:02:31.054
 Turn the steak when it is completely browned. 

00:02:33.883 --> 00:02:37.941
 Turn off the heat as soon as both sides are browned 

00:02:41.208 --> 00:02:43.991
 and use the tongs to put the steak on a plate. 

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:52.854
 Cover it with aluminum foil while you are working on the next step. 

00:02:54.023 --> 00:02:57.697
 Now make the delicious ponzu sauce with onions. 

00:02:58.399 --> 00:03:02.561
 Remove the rest of the oil from the kitchen paper pan. 

00:03:04.293 --> 00:03:08.315
 Add the sake and let the alcohol evaporate. 

00:03:13.882 --> 00:03:15.846
 Turn on the fire 

00:03:17.645 --> 00:03:19.586
 and add the grated onion. 

00:03:21.011 --> 00:03:26.603
 Stir with a spatula and cook the onion until the sharp odor becomes softer. 

00:03:28.143 --> 00:03:30.859
 Add the ponzu sauce based on citrus, 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.161
 the grated look 

00:03:35.698 --> 00:03:37.032
 and the butter. 

00:03:37.032 --> 00:03:41.638
 Keep stirring with the spatula and bring the sauce to the boil. 

00:03:42.385 --> 00:03:46.287
 The sauce is ready when the butter is completely melted. 

00:03:47.684 --> 00:03:50.093
 Pour it into a sauce bowl. 

00:03:52.148 --> 00:03:55.562
 Now make the donburi steak. 

00:03:56.494 --> 00:04:00.373
 Place the lettuce bars in a bowl with warm steamed rice. 

00:04:01.666 --> 00:04:06.601
 Then place the onion and the oyster mushroom along the side of the bowl. 

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:12.228
 Remove the aluminum foil from the plate 

00:04:14.616 --> 00:04:17.235
 and place the steak on a cutting board. 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.509
 Cut the beef with diagonal cuts. 

00:04:27.346 --> 00:04:32.554
 Place the beef slices on the lettuce with the pink inside facing up. 

00:04:33.737 --> 00:04:37.327
 Finally garnish with the watercress. 

00:04:38.188 --> 00:04:46.329
 Just before serving, pour a generous portion of the ponzu sauce with onions over the beef, onions and oyster mushroom. 

00:04:46.329 --> 00:04:53.181
 Wasabi also fits very well with this recipe, try it if you are in an adventurous mood. 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:03.132
 Bake the steak Ã  point so that the beef is soft and the pink slices look attractive. 

00:05:03.132 --> 00:05:05.238
 Success in the kitchen!
