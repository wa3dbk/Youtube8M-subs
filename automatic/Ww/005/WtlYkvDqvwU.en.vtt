00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 hi everyone amazed 100 case I hope that 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.810
 you're fine anyway I'm fine 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.339
 nickel 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.080
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.490
 new video on gta 5 where I am going 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.240
 present a mode that is really 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.590
 magnificent 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.929
 I think it's the mode of more 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.670
 interesting the most that the most fun who 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.500
 can be on the game now 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.420
 is this the spider man mode so like 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.100
 you can see it on the gameplay so 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.730
 to achieve this result you need 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.800
 two modes 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.869
 the first is the skin so spider man 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.550
 for your characters and the second 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.109
 this is the grappling mode that will us 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.300
 allow climbing all buildings 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.189
 of los santos and frankly are really 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.719
 way to have fun hawks is gone 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.000
 look here you just have to shoot 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.350
 with your gun on a building for 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.180
 climbing or climbing 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.879
 hop there anywhere frankly that's 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.710
 really stylish seems so for example 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.930
 here are the graves and an anti 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.910
 spider man then has it if you want 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.200
 for example a dish like this is a 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.469
 apprentice rega flow but does not arrive 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.430
 still to fall back on his paws under 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.620
 the look of heaven on a 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.770
 similar vehicle here I missed a little 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.239
 a dish that hits us all well 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.220
 single nickel device on that of 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:07.520
 before I missed hop there nickel one 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:12.810
 front is a bit hard 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:15.659
 a truck there I do not actually get what 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.970
 is hot it's you can not you 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.710
 are obliged to shoot quickly and 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.320
 shot adjust your shot to succeed at 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.549
 tickets you want is referred 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.479
 Then there's also a thing that is not 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.659
 bad so I just have to find a 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:33.229
 blow down here's the mouth not everything so we 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:35.939
 aim at shooting there you stop aiming 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.210
 even and boom that I think it's 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.520
 cool 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.020
 the same you shoot you aim at 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.820
 stop aiming and well you launch it 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.610

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.920
 full she does not want in this chain 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.119
 died right in there I could aim I 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.130
 believe it's just with the NPCs in 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.320
 fact that if you if you aim that you 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.950

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:03.110
