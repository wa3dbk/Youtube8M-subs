hi I'm Keith McCullough welcome back
today<00:00:03.060> I<00:00:03.179> want<00:00:03.419> to<00:00:03.449> talk<00:00:03.629> a<00:00:03.689> little<00:00:03.899> bit<00:00:04.170> about

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
today I want to talk a little bit about

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.470 
today I want to talk a little bit about
getting<00:00:04.470> beat<00:00:05.100> up<00:00:05.130> yesterday<00:00:05.490> in<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.089> market

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
getting beat up yesterday in the market

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.270 
getting beat up yesterday in the market
obviously<00:00:06.960> the<00:00:07.049> market<00:00:07.410> went<00:00:07.589> up<00:00:07.680> and<00:00:07.950> I'm<00:00:08.069> net

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
obviously the market went up and I'm net

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.250 
obviously the market went up and I'm net
short<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:08.760> market<00:00:08.790> so<00:00:09.510> I<00:00:09.540> need<00:00:09.750> to<00:00:09.840> kind<00:00:10.050> of<00:00:10.110> go

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
short the market so I need to kind of go

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.799 
short the market so I need to kind of go
through<00:00:10.290> that<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:11.010> review<00:00:11.700> where<00:00:12.179> I<00:00:12.210> stand<00:00:12.599> I

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
through that and review where I stand I

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.030 
through that and review where I stand I
think<00:00:12.960> it's<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.139> really<00:00:13.170> important<00:00:13.769> time<00:00:13.980> to

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
think it's a really important time to

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.129 
think it's a really important time to
differentiate<00:00:14.910> what<00:00:15.420> happened<00:00:15.750> yesterday

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
differentiate what happened yesterday

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.930 
differentiate what happened yesterday
which<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:16.920> of<00:00:17.039> course<00:00:17.070> an<00:00:17.430> immediate<00:00:17.789> term

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
which is of course an immediate term

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.120 
which is of course an immediate term
trade<00:00:18.300> versus<00:00:19.230> what<00:00:19.439> we've<00:00:19.619> been<00:00:19.800> concerned

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
trade versus what we've been concerned

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.790 
trade versus what we've been concerned
about<00:00:20.340> which<00:00:20.939> are<00:00:21.119> emerging<00:00:21.810> intermediate

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
about which are emerging intermediate

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.340 
about which are emerging intermediate
term<00:00:23.039> trends<00:00:23.550> so<00:00:24.150> let's<00:00:24.359> get<00:00:24.750> into<00:00:24.900> that<00:00:25.080> right

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
term trends so let's get into that right

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.500 
term trends so let's get into that right
away<00:00:25.470> on<00:00:25.769> growth<00:00:26.070> slowing<00:00:26.460> specifically<00:00:27.300> I

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
away on growth slowing specifically I

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.900 
away on growth slowing specifically I
think<00:00:27.990> that<00:00:28.050> it's<00:00:28.650> really<00:00:28.769> simple<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.519> to

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
think that it's really simple and to

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.330 
think that it's really simple and to
change<00:00:30.210> our<00:00:30.449> view<00:00:30.720> from<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.800> growth<00:00:32.040> slowing

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
change our view from a growth slowing

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.240 
change our view from a growth slowing
perspective<00:00:32.969> we'd<00:00:33.120> have<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.480> see<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:34.250> inflation

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
perspective we'd have to see a inflation

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.100 
perspective we'd have to see a inflation
decelerate<00:00:35.880> which<00:00:36.030> it's<00:00:36.180> not<00:00:36.239> doing<00:00:36.719> but

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
decelerate which it's not doing but

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.170 
decelerate which it's not doing but
moreover<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.680> big<00:00:37.890> three<00:00:38.219> signals<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:38.879> I'll

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
moreover the big three signals and I'll

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.150 
moreover the big three signals and I'll
go<00:00:39.329> through<00:00:39.360> them<00:00:39.660> one<00:00:39.719> by<00:00:39.840> one<00:00:39.989> number<00:00:40.710> 1<00:00:41.010> i'd

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
go through them one by one number 1 i'd

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.100 
go through them one by one number 1 i'd
have<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.340> see<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.730> dollar<00:00:41.940> go<00:00:42.180> up<00:00:42.390> as<00:00:42.690> opposed

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
have to see the dollar go up as opposed

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.380 
have to see the dollar go up as opposed
to<00:00:43.290> down<00:00:43.550> number<00:00:44.550> 2<00:00:44.730> i'd<00:00:44.910> have<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.120> see

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
to down number 2 i'd have to see

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.270 
to down number 2 i'd have to see
interest<00:00:45.660> rates<00:00:45.809> breakout<00:00:46.530> above<00:00:46.980> our

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
interest rates breakout above our

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.830 
interest rates breakout above our
intermediate<00:00:48.059> term<00:00:48.239> trend<00:00:48.570> line<00:00:48.719> of

intermediate term trend line of

intermediate term trend line of
resistance<00:00:48.960> which<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.219> spot<00:00:50.489> 80<00:00:50.789> percent

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
resistance which is to spot 80 percent

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.600 
resistance which is to spot 80 percent
and<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.960> has<00:00:52.110> not<00:00:52.289> in<00:00:52.590> other<00:00:52.739> words<00:00:52.920> rates<00:00:53.219> from

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
and it has not in other words rates from

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.220 
and it has not in other words rates from
a<00:00:53.730> trend<00:00:54.000> perspective<00:00:54.600> are<00:00:54.719> still<00:00:54.930> going<00:00:55.199> down

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
a trend perspective are still going down

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.500 
a trend perspective are still going down
and<00:00:55.680> then<00:00:56.039> number<00:00:56.190> three<00:00:56.550> inflation

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
and then number three inflation

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.750 
and then number three inflation
expectations<00:00:58.350> as<00:00:58.530> i<00:00:58.620> pointed<00:00:58.800> out<00:00:59.070> would<00:00:59.609> have

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
expectations as i pointed out would have

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.400 
expectations as i pointed out would have
to<00:00:59.940> calm<00:01:00.149> down<00:01:00.180> obviously<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.379> not

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
to calm down obviously that is not

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.529 
to calm down obviously that is not
happening<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.489> crb<00:01:02.940> index<00:01:02.969> for<00:01:03.480> the

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
happening the crb index for the

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.780 
happening the crb index for the
year-to-date<00:01:03.840> continues<00:01:04.739> higher<00:01:04.979> as<00:01:05.220> do

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
year-to-date continues higher as do

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.640 
year-to-date continues higher as do
things<00:01:06.030> like<00:01:06.240> gold<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:06.810> those<00:01:07.020> three<00:01:07.290> things

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
things like gold so those three things

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.289 
things like gold so those three things
are<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.340> big<00:01:08.520> things<00:01:08.729> from<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.060> trend

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
are the big things from a trend

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.000 
are the big things from a trend
perspective<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.350> I'm<00:01:10.500> really<00:01:10.650> concerned

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
perspective that I'm really concerned

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.679 
perspective that I'm really concerned
about<00:01:11.159> now<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:12.150> kind<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.450> an<00:01:12.600> environment

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
about now in that kind of an environment

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.410 
about now in that kind of an environment
you're<00:01:13.619> there<00:01:13.830> things<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.340> work<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.850> things

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
you're there things that work and things

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.480 
you're there things that work and things
that<00:01:15.600> don't<00:01:15.900> work<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.350> think<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.830> when<00:01:17.310> people

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
that don't work I think that when people

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.429 
that don't work I think that when people
talk<00:01:17.880> about<00:01:17.909> being<00:01:18.420> bearish<00:01:18.810> they<00:01:19.020> typically

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
talk about being bearish they typically

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.780 
talk about being bearish they typically
don't<00:01:19.619> know<00:01:19.830> what<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.130> do<00:01:20.280> on<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.580> long<00:01:20.759> side

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
don't know what to do on the long side

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.840 
don't know what to do on the long side
now<00:01:21.390> that's<00:01:21.900> not<00:01:22.170> how<00:01:22.380> we<00:01:22.439> roll<00:01:22.799> if<00:01:23.490> we<00:01:23.759> were

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
now that's not how we roll if we were

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.700 
now that's not how we roll if we were
bullish<00:01:24.240> on<00:01:24.390> inflation<00:01:24.930> accelerating<00:01:25.560> well

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
bullish on inflation accelerating well

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.620 
bullish on inflation accelerating well
you<00:01:26.130> want<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.369> be<00:01:26.460> long<00:01:26.640> inflation<00:01:27.119> assets<00:01:27.299> if

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
you want to be long inflation assets if

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.050 
you want to be long inflation assets if
you're<00:01:28.110> bullish<00:01:28.470> on<00:01:28.619> growth<00:01:28.950> slowing<00:01:29.369> while

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
you're bullish on growth slowing while

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.789 
you're bullish on growth slowing while
you<00:01:30.180> want<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.479> be<00:01:30.570> long<00:01:30.900> things<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.409> do<00:01:31.590> well

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
you want to be long things that do well

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.920 
you want to be long things that do well
in<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.159> slow<00:01:32.520> growth<00:01:32.790> environment<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.780> let's

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
in a slow growth environment so let's

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.420 
in a slow growth environment so let's
look<00:01:34.079> at<00:01:34.200> what's<00:01:34.380> what's<00:01:34.890> what's<00:01:34.950> working

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
look at what's what's what's working

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.870

year-to-date that's kind of the

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.410 
year-to-date that's kind of the

percent for the year to date again as

percent for the year to date again as
interest<00:01:47.399> rates<00:01:47.520> continue<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.270> trend<00:01:48.509> lower

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
interest rates continue to trend lower

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.840 
interest rates continue to trend lower
we're<00:01:49.380> not<00:01:49.530> as<00:01:49.680> bullish<00:01:50.009> on<00:01:50.159> rates<00:01:50.430> as<00:01:50.610> we<00:01:50.729> were

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
we're not as bullish on rates as we were

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.850 
we're not as bullish on rates as we were
last<00:01:51.119> year<00:01:51.299> in<00:01:51.600> fact<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.259> think<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:52.590> interest

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
last year in fact I think that interest

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.380 
last year in fact I think that interest
rates<00:01:52.920> go<00:01:53.130> lower<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:53.970> think<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.270> that's

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
rates go lower and I think that that's

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.679 
rates go lower and I think that that's
why<00:01:54.630> REITs<00:01:54.930> go<00:01:55.170> higher<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.619> then<00:01:56.009> finally

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
why REITs go higher and then finally

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:58.969 
why REITs go higher and then finally
utilities<00:01:57.689> now<00:01:57.960> utilities<00:01:58.530> as<00:01:58.710> you'll<00:01:58.829> recall

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
utilities now utilities as you'll recall

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.300 
utilities now utilities as you'll recall
much<00:01:59.700> like<00:01:59.969> gold<00:02:00.240> in<00:02:00.420> 2011<00:02:01.110> started<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.130> act

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
much like gold in 2011 started to act

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.880 
much like gold in 2011 started to act
very<00:02:02.430> positively<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.390> what<00:02:03.659> inflation<00:02:04.619> was

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
very positively to what inflation was

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.920 
very positively to what inflation was
accelerating<00:02:05.610> us<00:02:06.060> consumption<00:02:06.600> growth

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
accelerating us consumption growth

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.779 
accelerating us consumption growth
served<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.320> slow<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:08.039> consumer<00:02:08.489> stock

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
served to slow the consumer stock

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.940 
served to slow the consumer stock
started<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.390> not<00:02:09.569> work<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.110> people<00:02:10.500> had<00:02:10.830> to

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
started to not work and people had to

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.890 
started to not work and people had to
dog<00:02:11.160> pile<00:02:11.459> into<00:02:11.700> utility<00:02:12.060> so<00:02:12.629> again

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
dog pile into utility so again

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.630 
dog pile into utility so again
that's<00:02:13.019> what's<00:02:13.230> working<00:02:13.470> it's<00:02:13.950> not<00:02:14.159> the<00:02:14.370> trade

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
that's what's working it's not the trade

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.610 
that's what's working it's not the trade
it's<00:02:14.849> a<00:02:14.970> developing<00:02:15.450> trend<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:16.049> I<00:02:16.319> think<00:02:16.470> that

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
it's a developing trend and I think that

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.140 
it's a developing trend and I think that
that's<00:02:16.769> a<00:02:16.890> really<00:02:17.129> important<00:02:17.519> point<00:02:17.700> now

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
that's a really important point now

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.479 
that's a really important point now
finally<00:02:18.629> what's<00:02:18.840> not<00:02:19.049> working<00:02:19.319> of<00:02:19.769> course<00:02:20.250> is

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
finally what's not working of course is

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.119 
finally what's not working of course is
the<00:02:20.939> growth<00:02:21.269> stuff<00:02:21.599> so<00:02:22.079> again<00:02:22.290> when<00:02:22.650> growth<00:02:22.920> is

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
the growth stuff so again when growth is

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.940 
the growth stuff so again when growth is
slowing<00:02:23.430> don't<00:02:24.299> be<00:02:24.689> long<00:02:24.959> growth<00:02:25.530> that

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
slowing don't be long growth that

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.979 
slowing don't be long growth that
includes<00:02:26.549> consumption<00:02:27.299> growth<00:02:27.510> that's<00:02:27.780> why

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
includes consumption growth that's why

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.539 
includes consumption growth that's why
