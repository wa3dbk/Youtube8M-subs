00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.030 
wait and you watch it and you take a
fork<00:02:01.190> and<00:02:01.490> you<00:02:01.909> just<00:02:02.120> basically<00:02:02.860> push<00:02:03.860> it

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
fork and you just basically push it

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.560 
fork and you just basically push it
around<00:02:04.130> until<00:02:04.820> you<00:02:05.210> get<00:02:05.330> the<00:02:05.480> right

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
around until you get the right

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:06.370 
around until you get the right
consistency

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
consistency

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.050 
consistency
you<00:02:06.770> can<00:02:06.890> always<00:02:07.040> add<00:02:07.250> more<00:02:07.280> or<00:02:07.580> less<00:02:07.850> water

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
you can always add more or less water

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.290 
you can always add more or less water
depending<00:02:08.660> on<00:02:08.780> what<00:02:09.050> you're<00:02:09.200> going<00:02:09.800> for<00:02:10.300> so

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
depending on what you're going for so

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.199 
depending on what you're going for so
once<00:02:11.480> this<00:02:11.660> is<00:02:11.720> all<00:02:12.760> expanded

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
once this is all expanded

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.960 
once this is all expanded
what<00:02:14.480> I<00:02:14.510> tend<00:02:14.810> to<00:02:14.900> do<00:02:15.140> is<00:02:15.530> then<00:02:15.860> I<00:02:15.950> will<00:02:16.189> press

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
what I tend to do is then I will press

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.339 
what I tend to do is then I will press
it<00:02:17.120> down<00:02:17.299> you<00:02:17.569> want<00:02:17.659> to<00:02:17.750> make<00:02:17.900> it<00:02:18.939> relatively

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
it down you want to make it relatively

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.899 
it down you want to make it relatively
compacted<00:02:21.349> so<00:02:21.560> that<00:02:21.829> the<00:02:22.069> tarantula<00:02:22.730> can

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:22.909 
compacted so that the tarantula can

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.750 
compacted so that the tarantula can
burrow<00:02:23.180> into<00:02:23.930> it<00:02:24.110> and<00:02:24.319> not<00:02:24.620> have<00:02:25.310> it<00:02:25.340> collapse

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
burrow into it and not have it collapse

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.550 
burrow into it and not have it collapse
around<00:02:26.230> them<00:02:27.489> so<00:02:28.489> what<00:02:28.610> I<00:02:28.640> like<00:02:28.909> to<00:02:29.030> do<00:02:29.180> I<00:02:29.560> take

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
around them so what I like to do I take

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.270 
around them so what I like to do I take
the<00:02:30.769> half<00:02:31.069> log<00:02:31.370> and<00:02:31.819> I'm<00:02:32.239> actually<00:02:32.390> going<00:02:32.689> to

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
the half log and I'm actually going to

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.240 
the half log and I'm actually going to
squish<00:02:34.280> it<00:02:34.459> down<00:02:34.700> into<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.859> substrate<00:02:36.859> at<00:02:37.129> an

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
squish it down into the substrate at an

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.619 
squish it down into the substrate at an
angle<00:02:37.840> and<00:02:38.840> I<00:02:38.989> want<00:02:39.140> the<00:02:39.290> back<00:02:39.849> edge<00:02:40.849> of<00:02:41.450> the

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:41.629 
angle and I want the back edge of the

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:43.210 
angle and I want the back edge of the
log<00:02:41.840> up<00:02:42.109> against<00:02:42.470> the<00:02:42.650> side<00:02:42.920> of<00:02:42.950> the<00:02:43.069> enclosure

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
log up against the side of the enclosure

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.819 
log up against the side of the enclosure
what<00:02:44.209> I'm<00:02:44.299> doing<00:02:44.569> here<00:02:44.750> is<00:02:44.900> actually<00:02:45.049> digging

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
what I'm doing here is actually digging

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:49.030 
what I'm doing here is actually digging
out<00:02:46.129> a<00:02:46.159> hole<00:02:46.750> which<00:02:47.750> will<00:02:47.930> serve<00:02:48.379> as<00:02:48.680> a

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
out a hole which will serve as a

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.970 
out a hole which will serve as a
pre-made<00:02:49.489> barrow<00:02:49.790> for<00:02:50.329> the<00:02:50.530> tarantula<00:02:51.530> you

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
pre-made barrow for the tarantula you

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.710 
pre-made barrow for the tarantula you
can<00:02:52.099> see<00:02:52.280> that<00:02:52.459> there's<00:02:52.639> a<00:02:52.700> hole<00:02:52.970> at<00:02:53.269> the<00:02:53.389> end

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
can see that there's a hole at the end

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.390 
can see that there's a hole at the end
that's<00:02:54.170> up<00:02:54.379> against<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.739> enclosure<00:02:55.069> so<00:02:55.310> you

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
that's up against the enclosure so you

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.390 
that's up against the enclosure so you
can<00:02:55.519> actually<00:02:55.670> see<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.389> spider<00:02:57.109> and<00:02:57.400> you

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
can actually see the spider and you

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.750 
can actually see the spider and you
actually<00:02:58.819> want<00:02:59.090> to<00:02:59.349> compress<00:03:00.349> the<00:03:00.769> substrate

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
actually want to compress the substrate

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.259 
actually want to compress the substrate
enough<00:03:02.000> so<00:03:02.209> that<00:03:02.359> the<00:03:03.939> that<00:03:04.939> this

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
enough so that the that this

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.119 
enough so that the that this
construction<00:03:05.750> doesn't<00:03:06.109> fall<00:03:06.379> apart<00:03:06.470> once<00:03:06.920> the

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:07.129 
construction doesn't fall apart once the

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:09.339 
construction doesn't fall apart once the
substrate<00:03:07.459> dries<00:03:07.879> so<00:03:08.150> you<00:03:08.209> can<00:03:08.389> see<00:03:08.629> looks

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
substrate dries so you can see looks

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.229 
substrate dries so you can see looks
pretty<00:03:09.560> cool<00:03:09.769> it's<00:03:10.010> like<00:03:10.069> a<00:03:10.159> barrow<00:03:10.790> at<00:03:11.000> a<00:03:11.060> half

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
pretty cool it's like a barrow at a half

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.869 
pretty cool it's like a barrow at a half
angle<00:03:11.480> and<00:03:12.019> he'll<00:03:12.560> be<00:03:12.680> able<00:03:12.799> to<00:03:12.950> hide<00:03:13.489> in<00:03:13.700> there

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:13.879 
angle and he'll be able to hide in there

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:15.699 
angle and he'll be able to hide in there
and<00:03:14.030> feel<00:03:14.209> comfortable<00:03:14.720> so<00:03:15.290> what<00:03:15.409> I<00:03:15.439> like<00:03:15.620> to

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
do is I take this plant you can see it

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.699 
do is I take this plant you can see it
has<00:03:17.389> a<00:03:17.769> wire<00:03:19.389> stem<00:03:20.389> you<00:03:20.959> can<00:03:21.019> actually<00:03:21.199> just

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
has a wire stem you can actually just

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.920 
has a wire stem you can actually just
push<00:03:22.040> it<00:03:22.220> down<00:03:22.250> right<00:03:22.819> into<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:23.239> substrate<00:03:23.660> I

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
push it down right into the substrate I

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.259 
push it down right into the substrate I
like<00:03:24.290> to<00:03:24.379> put<00:03:24.530> it<00:03:24.620> in<00:03:24.709> the<00:03:24.799> corner<00:03:25.129> makes<00:03:26.120> it

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
like to put it in the corner makes it

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.119 
like to put it in the corner makes it
look<00:03:26.419> good<00:03:27.579> and<00:03:29.500> trying<00:03:30.500> to<00:03:30.590> go<00:03:30.709> for<00:03:30.889> a<00:03:30.949> more

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:31.129 
look good and trying to go for a more

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:35.680 
look good and trying to go for a more
natural<00:03:31.159> look<00:03:31.930> for<00:03:32.930> this<00:03:33.049> enclosure<00:03:33.470> and<00:03:34.690> what

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
natural look for this enclosure and what

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.559 
natural look for this enclosure and what
I'm<00:03:35.840> going<00:03:36.079> to<00:03:36.109> do<00:03:36.319> now<00:03:36.620> is<00:03:37.010> I'm<00:03:37.669> going<00:03:37.819> to<00:03:37.940> take

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
I'm going to do now is I'm going to take

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.530 
I'm going to do now is I'm going to take
the<00:03:38.959> moss<00:03:39.889> and<00:03:40.310> I<00:03:40.459> added<00:03:40.760> water<00:03:40.940> to<00:03:41.239> it<00:03:41.389> I

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
the moss and I added water to it I

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.390 
the moss and I added water to it I
actually<00:03:41.780> like<00:03:42.139> to<00:03:42.169> microwave<00:03:42.799> this<00:03:43.010> before<00:03:43.370> I

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
actually like to microwave this before I

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.580 
actually like to microwave this before I
use<00:03:43.669> it<00:03:43.699> I've<00:03:44.000> had<00:03:44.269> issues<00:03:44.720> with<00:03:44.900> mold<00:03:45.229> growth

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
use it I've had issues with mold growth

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.000 
use it I've had issues with mold growth
with<00:03:45.859> this<00:03:45.979> moss<00:03:46.780> so<00:03:47.780> what<00:03:48.109> I<00:03:48.139> do<00:03:48.229> is<00:03:48.560> I<00:03:48.680> spread

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
with this moss so what I do is I spread

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.619 
with this moss so what I do is I spread
it<00:03:49.069> in<00:03:49.250> here<00:03:49.519> this<00:03:49.669> helps<00:03:49.940> to<00:03:50.060> retain<00:03:50.209> moisture

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:50.629 
it in here this helps to retain moisture

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.349 
it in here this helps to retain moisture
in<00:03:50.959> the<00:03:51.489> enclosure<00:03:52.489> I'm<00:03:52.819> going<00:03:52.970> to<00:03:53.030> put<00:03:53.150> it<00:03:53.239> up

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359 
in the enclosure I'm going to put it up

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:56.199 
in the enclosure I'm going to put it up
under<00:03:53.599> this<00:03:53.840> plant<00:03:54.709> Novolog<00:03:55.489> just<00:03:56.000> kind<00:03:56.150> of

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
under this plant Novolog just kind of

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.319 
under this plant Novolog just kind of
give<00:03:56.329> it<00:03:56.359> more<00:03:56.659> of<00:03:56.780> a<00:03:56.840> natural<00:03:57.290> feel<00:03:57.560> and<00:03:58.549> you

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
give it more of a natural feel and you

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:02.740 
give it more of a natural feel and you
know<00:03:59.419> when<00:03:59.569> you<00:03:59.769> spray<00:04:00.769> down<00:04:00.919> your<00:04:00.979> tank<00:04:01.750> with

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:36.340 
round make sure it's not on top of the
plants<00:04:33.550> this<00:04:34.550> will<00:04:34.760> be<00:04:35.300> plenty<00:04:35.990> of<00:04:36.110> room<00:04:36.320> for

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
plants this will be plenty of room for

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.710 
plants this will be plenty of room for
my<00:04:37.310> bigger<00:04:37.840> terrestrial<00:04:38.840> tarantula

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
my bigger terrestrial tarantula

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.970 
my bigger terrestrial tarantula
so<00:04:41.720> next<00:04:42.290> step<00:04:42.500> we<00:04:43.010> want<00:04:43.130> to<00:04:43.370> add<00:04:43.610> a<00:04:43.970> water<00:04:44.480> bowl

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
so next step we want to add a water bowl

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.510 
so next step we want to add a water bowl
so<00:04:45.980> I'm<00:04:46.760> going<00:04:47.030> to<00:04:47.180> take<00:04:47.450> that<00:04:48.370> container<00:04:49.370> that

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
so I'm going to take that container that

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.460 
so I'm going to take that container that
I<00:04:49.700> had<00:04:49.970> obviously<00:04:50.390> you<00:04:50.960> don't<00:04:51.080> want<00:04:51.200> to<00:04:51.350> have

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
I had obviously you don't want to have

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.050 
I had obviously you don't want to have
any<00:04:51.650> harsh<00:04:51.920> chemicals<00:04:52.430> or<00:04:52.520> anything<00:04:52.700> in<00:04:52.940> there

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
any harsh chemicals or anything in there

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.150 
any harsh chemicals or anything in there
so<00:04:53.480> it's<00:04:53.990> always<00:04:54.080> good<00:04:54.320> to<00:04:54.410> get<00:04:54.530> one<00:04:54.740> right<00:04:55.010> out

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
so it's always good to get one right out

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.830 
so it's always good to get one right out

of the package and you can just rinse it

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.020 
of the package and you can just rinse it
out<00:04:56.990> and<00:04:57.290> what<00:04:58.040> you<00:04:58.130> want<00:04:58.280> to<00:04:58.340> do<00:04:58.460> is<00:04:58.610> just<00:04:58.760> push
