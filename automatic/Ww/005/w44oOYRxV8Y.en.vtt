 and start with what we need 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:06.960
 sunflower oil somewhere probably 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:13.010

 ahval pour more oil heated and 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:21.150
 the very first thing we do is first 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:24.350
 knitting needles and throwing beans in there means 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.350

 cover it so it will be faster and 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:23.080
 wait 5-7 minutes then knead it 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.780
 time to prevent our vegetables 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:30.620

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.720
 time we will wash this flight and turn on 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:46.760

 as rice is very good quality 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.079
 enough to wash out once 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.099
 notice that the water is almost clear 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:31.909

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.860
 more than rice since we had 3 st 

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:38.560
 one cup means hot water should 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:38.560
 be two cups and so cup time 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:49.029
 the proportion should always be 1 1 2 2 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:51.229
