00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.969
 work as it comes down 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.390
 Now let's select and clean the 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.219
 different species of eucalyptus that have 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.000
 come and take it once to the 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:40.000
 week from huelva 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.890
 we receive it every Thursday 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.190
 Y 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.710
 every week 12 species come 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:56.110
 different from eucalyptus that are about 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:58.420
 105 grams per week and we put 4 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.930
 different species to each copy of 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.600
 block tail we have 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.400
 they have the packaging of our form and 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.970
 they come 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.120
 in a refrigerated truck because it's very 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.150
 important that you keep 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:19.200
 much less are we going to 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.200
 is the package to gross 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.930
 or the different ones to play kameni or what 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.180
 that he 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.180
 the amount you expect we have happy 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:42.720
 As you can see, each bouquet with the species 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:46.270
 which is a name of the species in this 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:49.840
 case would be particular eucalyptus 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:52.480
 now let's wait kind by 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:57.840
 kind of the bouquets have come for that 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:00.520
 then it's easier to put it 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.170
 from the camera where that door 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.710
 the different sentences of the joint 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.710
 capetillo 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.510
 once the eucalyptus is placed 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.670
 depending on the species, we store it in the 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.040
 cold room that we have inside 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.799
 of the state they look the same 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.370
 the eucalyptus is placed in these doors 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:46.219
 that contains the water to make sure 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:50.260
 that the good quality that 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:53.170
 be fresh at the time of that consumption 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.870
 the local spices are classified in 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.930
 blue and red depending on the 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.810
 concentration of tannins that have 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.900
 and what we do is have a record of 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.219
 all the spices that we have for 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:10.209
 talk and select the ready place that 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:12.519
 We offer them daily and select 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:15.670
 very well the species that can 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:19.030
 to consume trying never to offer these 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:22.229
 that are very strong because they find it 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.229
 harder to digest 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.620
 every day we offer you 8 species of 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.900
 eucalyptus different because which 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.090
 they are very selective animals and from this 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.860
 way we make sure they have the 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.860
 option to be able to choose 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:44.720
 we always try not to use more than 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:48.070
 a blue species a day since they are more 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.070
 difficult to digest
