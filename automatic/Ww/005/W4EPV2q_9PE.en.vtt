00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.099
 hello hello and welcome to all and 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.960
 to all on cocktail today a 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.119
 new introductory video that carries 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.160
 on a new gauthier not worth gauthier 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.009
 who comes back from xigmatek and who 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.590
 bears the name two milestones is to do 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.410
 a little bit from time to time the heel 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.240
 and a gauthier who inaugurates a new 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.340
 style effect we'll say with a 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:47.130
 design a bit floor his lands on 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.740
 has a donation of 2 5 degrees forward to 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.480
 level of the front is so 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.580
 shifts a little bit of the whole case 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.020
 it's seeing it's pretty much 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.660
 design level 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:02.670
 it does not change for the rest so we have the 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.830
 xigmatek heels half atheists x2 8 7 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.230
 kg steel chassis stay it for 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.500
 interior plastics one has a 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.900
 200 mm front fan 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:16.830
 front maybe 140 mm at the back 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:20.100
 we also have three 5.25 inch bays 8 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.540
 3.5 inch 2.5 inch bays and all 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.890
 will be offered at a price of 99 euros 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:30.990
 to discover in video you are on tou tv 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.300
 so here is the famous and new talent 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.360
 as it was said a housing that leans 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.340
 25 degrees forward if you are 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.830
 put on you but you'll see it's 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.570
 immediately much more obvious 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.220
 goes that the facade is slightly shifted 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.430
 pushes forward and so that shifts a 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.110
 little bit the whole case design is 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.080
 certainly it's pretty pretty 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.250
 in addition it is rather well done and we will 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.510
 note immediately we have the impression 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.420
 that there is really a clear improvement 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.130
 quality on this xigmatek case 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.900
 with a very beautiful lifeguards very 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.480
 pleasant to the touch and new paint 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.610
 others that is dull that manifest themselves 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:10.240
 with the soft touch then we start 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.790
 with the front two housings on 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.190
 which we will discover the three bays 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.690
 25 inches we see the cachous one 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.050
 specific form one is always in 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:24.790
 those of 25 Â° of bus is below one has 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:27.790
 a passade with the grid all while 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.880
 softouch like on the top here of the mesh 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.130
 and at the back a 200 mm fan 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:39.100
 with white diodes that will bring a small 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:41.800
 little light on the top we have everything 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:45.730
 first a hatch a hatch that 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:48.220
 hide two usb 3.0 two usb 2.0 as well 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.880
 that the audio output inputs and the 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:55.450
 reset of the power unit and is 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:59.890
 here they will illuminate is above us 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:02.050
 have a smoked plexi window that we 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.510
 can remove very easily we see 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.910
 we have two little winds up front 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.160
 and on that we can place two 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.220
 fans of 120 mm or 200 two 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.320
 fans of 140 mm or 1,200 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.810
 mm or radiator master of 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.640
 watercooling since we will have enough 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.380
 place for a planet below and 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.390
 fans above or below 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.030
 fans above and below 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.700
 to make the push- pull brief a lot of 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:32.890
 possibilities that it is very good 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:36.550
 done and enough the bed we continue on the 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.410
 side we find a window a window 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.930
 who is also working in her 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.910
 fans since here at the arfons sowing 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.730
 its pretty window bubbles and of 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.770
 super guy again was but 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.730
 we do not necessarily hang but some 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:54.590
 worlds we now go to the back 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.920
 of this talent's chassis 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.480
 this heel with two pass-walls on 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.040
 sees that there are two passages if we decide 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.360
 to put the radiator for example at 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.819
 so on to bring out the 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.550
 studios one is so a grid in 120 140 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.810
 mm equipped with its 140 mm fan to 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.170
 the location for the wound which over 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.239
 from the doors of the motherboard to 2 3 4 5 6 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.090
 7 8 expansion slots which is rather 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:19.010
 well via caches that are metal 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.680
 mesh and the location of the feed 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.960
 in the bottom that blunted and with a 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:30.290
 complete filter that corsican where all the 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:31.010
 casing the other side does not present anything 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.100
 specific 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.650
 now go on the case with the 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.990
 Turkish 8.7 kg we see it's pretty easy 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.940
 to move the heel heels he's not 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.380
 too soon below we have both feet 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.680
 the feet that allow to have 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:48.110
 the inclination 2005 given and we have the 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:52.460
 big grid that is protected by this 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:56.919
 large filter to expand inside 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.919
 of this talent to discover his chassis 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:03.590
 inside especially the heels to 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.180
 you see if we pronounce French 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.910
 see langles does not disappoint hide it 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.039
 if who is clearly up to date at the front 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.630
 we have the bays 5 25 inches 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:14.660
 we have three in a mounting system 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.970
 by cliffs sam applies these practices in 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.229
 below we have two cages hdd one two 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.169
 three replacements one of five 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:23.780
 locations that of the bed can be 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:25.130
 withdrawn for for example at large 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.320
 graphics cards we see that we get to 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.780
 the plumb of the diet with 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.450
 only the bottom cage in the cage 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.880
 that we have baskets do not panic are 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:37.220
 ssd and hdd compatible 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.139
 we can not wait to attack plastic for 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:42.880
 editing and hard drive and davies 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:42.880
 classic for mounting ssd 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.830
 in the bar we find the big gate 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.360
 as we have already seen from below with 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.450
 rubber studs for 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:56.300
 food is here the possibility of 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:58.910
 add a fan in 120 140 mm and 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.440
 of course the filter below to 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.750
 the back is a fan of 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.150
 140 mm white diodes 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.920
 everything connects to a 3 pin plug 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.920
 we also have two pass-throughs in 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:13.220
 the top i have them hui expansion slot 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:15.320
 to the mounting by hand screws and both 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:18.650
 new pass partitions always for the 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:21.290
 watercooling mine we do not see we also 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:23.540
 wide access backplate passages 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.850
 with rubber caps a small 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:28.460
 everywhere is pretty good with 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:30.950
 devices also to fix 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.540
 collars the passages in the water have 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.520
 not been forgotten whether it's for the 

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.860
 pipeline cpu or to add a 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.560
 200 mm fan finishes 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:43.220
 precisely with the upper part and the 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:45.290
 locations 120 to 140 mm 200 mm on 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:49.280
 may add a radiator 

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:53.180
 watercooling in 1240 280 mm without 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:56.060
 problem finally here we have the back of the 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:57.860
 chassis that also presents very well 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:01.330
 we see that in a lot of places in 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.330
 more at the back of the board 

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:06.350
 it was logical maths and heels you 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:08.300
 were sure that like tv you are told to 

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:10.810
 very soon for new videos from 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.810
 presentation
