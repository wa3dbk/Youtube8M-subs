00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:03.799
 Paul 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.520
 May 2005 a record attempt 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:12.209
 a French group wants to conquer the highest mountain in the world 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:21.769
 Never is a person with an aircraft on Mount Everest 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:22.989
 landed 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:25.989
 this is the third attempt of the group 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.750
 the winds and turbulence are unpredictable 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.770
 the cockpit cameras permanently installed the pilot alone on board 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.120
 every kilo counts 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.280
 Already with the weight of a single man manages the helicopter came 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.250
 to stay in the thin air 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.520
 slowly the Eurocopter extent of the Leyen dangerous screws 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.400
 but only almost 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.140
 again the pilot has to stop and return to the base camp 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.860
 for 5 m 1 6 and 13 the fourth attempt 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.400
 Under the helicopter is mounted a camera to document what should 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.400
 happens 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.890
 after 20 minutes 8000 meters 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.560
 This time it seems to be going smoothly 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.490
 finally up 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.850
 In the snow, oxygen bottles are the exhausted summiteers 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.680
 left behind 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.680
 7 o'clock 8 break on the roof of the world 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.330
 after 5 meters then the first ground contact in 8848 meters height 

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:19.789
 the third chamber at the tail rotor ices at 32 degrees minus 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:22.089
 still a warm day 

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:25.089
 usually 50 degrees minus here 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:32.830
 So the pilot can feed his greed on his machine for about three minutes 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:35.349
 highest mountain peaks of the Himalayas 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.349
 the world record is done 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.489
 Dr 

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:57.809
 OK 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.869
 you 

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:04.149
 he is 

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:07.459
 the pilot with his helpers without who could not make it 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.619
 this hit 

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:16.989
 I have my impressions 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.129
 rather cold 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:21.129
 but inside I am very warm 

00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:26.849
 "It's hard to say something now 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.849
 my heart is still beating for approx 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.199
 he has achieved his place in the history of the unequal couple 

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:39.009
 Aviation is safe and secure 

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:42.469
 Hardly anyone dared to go from such heights a hundred years before
