a<00:02:41.909> lot<00:02:42.090> of<00:02:42.150> batteries<00:02:42.510> but<00:02:42.660> it's<00:02:42.810> not<00:02:42.959> real

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
a lot of batteries but it's not real

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.680 
a lot of batteries but it's not real
thirsty<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.590> I<00:02:43.620> use<00:02:43.769> rechargeable<00:02:43.920> anyway<00:02:44.549> so

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
thirsty and I use rechargeable anyway so

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.580

it takes eight double-a batteries and
the<00:02:49.590> really<00:02:49.829> neat<00:02:49.980> thing<00:02:50.190> is<00:02:50.720> it<00:02:51.720> has<00:02:52.019> a

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
the really neat thing is it has a

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.789 
the really neat thing is it has a
failsafe<00:02:53.160> if<00:02:53.700> your<00:02:54.030> batteries<00:02:54.450> die<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:55.079> you

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
failsafe if your batteries die and you

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.030 
failsafe if your batteries die and you
don't<00:02:56.010> have<00:02:56.159> the<00:02:56.370> key<00:02:56.579> what's<00:02:57.510> a<00:02:57.629> good<00:02:58.109> idea<00:02:58.140> to

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
don't have the key what's a good idea to

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.860 
don't have the key what's a good idea to
keep<00:02:59.190> in<00:02:59.489> your<00:02:59.549> drawer<00:02:59.940> whatever<00:03:00.269> is<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.450> 9-volt

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
keep in your drawer whatever is a 9-volt

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.289 
keep in your drawer whatever is a 9-volt
battery<00:03:01.170> because<00:03:01.670> right<00:03:02.670> here<00:03:02.700> on<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.090> side

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
battery because right here on the side

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.569 
battery because right here on the side
are<00:03:03.569> these<00:03:03.900> two<00:03:04.109> little<00:03:04.349> contacts<00:03:04.799> for<00:03:05.519> a

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
are these two little contacts for a

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:08.119 
are these two little contacts for a
9-volt<00:03:06.090> battery<00:03:06.390> so<00:03:06.510> what<00:03:06.659> you<00:03:06.750> can<00:03:06.900> do<00:03:07.049> is<00:03:07.230> if

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
9-volt battery so what you can do is if

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:10.280 
9-volt battery so what you can do is if
your<00:03:08.400> internal<00:03:09.120> batteries<00:03:09.420> are<00:03:09.540> dead<00:03:09.690> you<00:03:10.140> can

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
your internal batteries are dead you can

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.380 
your internal batteries are dead you can
