00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.430
 for flights exams 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.509
 with moments 

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:12.509
 learn to 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:15.709
 the aunt of a notepad sheet 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:18.869
 the first mayor

 spotlight 

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:25.909
 pediatrics 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:28.069
 preferably 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:29.159
 that the assets 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:31.359
 of entity ink 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.220
 a case of 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.440
 five or six centimeters wide 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.880
 and from there we start 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.880
 with small print 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.690

 most 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.670
 we leave again 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.870
 inta 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.110
 you can check it 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.710
 and the east 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.090
 we reached the goal 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.090
 and we started 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.970
 in the middle of the paper 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.510
 let's do 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.380
 another item on the other side 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.750
 presence 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.750
 and there wait for them 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.500
 that the Senegalese 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.830
 then 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.980
 the most complicated part 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.280
 referents of the arch 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.280

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.250
 a small 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.250
 where everything can fit and if there is going to be a world 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.880
 and how everything is going 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.860
 and so they can copy on an exam without dying in the attempt 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.380
 can handle with one hand with the left 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.830
 they turn it over 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.350
