00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
a few different tools first just a

standard putty knife I like using a

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.970 
standard putty knife I like using a
smaller<00:00:23.640> one<00:00:23.910> for<00:00:24.119> this<00:00:24.300> job<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:25.260> accuracy<00:00:25.949> is

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
smaller one for this job the accuracy is

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.529 
smaller one for this job the accuracy is
a<00:00:26.130> little<00:00:26.460> bit<00:00:26.580> better<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.060> it's<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.300> little

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
a little bit better and it's a little

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.080 
a little bit better and it's a little
easier<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.960> move<00:00:28.260> an<00:00:29.119> exacto<00:00:30.119> knife<00:00:31.640> a<00:00:32.640> dry

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
least an inch and a half like I have

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.060 
least an inch and a half like I have
here<00:00:39.989> two<00:00:40.399> inches<00:00:41.399> works<00:00:41.730> well<00:00:42.059> also<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:43.079> then

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
here two inches works well also and then
