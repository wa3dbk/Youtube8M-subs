00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:08.470
 well we are here 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:12.280
 you remember that we leave it 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:16.660
 in the hole that we had planned 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:21.869
 install what the blacksmith had done and 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.869
 here is the piece 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.300
 At first 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:35.750
 and we proceed to teach what rivero has 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:40.070
 fact 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:45.710
 and this is the result, this is the piece 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:49.950
 that he had adapted there what he has done 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:54.180
 is to replace with this new piece 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:57.920
 and now we will proceed to the installation of 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.920
 this piece to the boiler 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:06.009
 here 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:10.509
 friends will install the piece with what 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:13.140
 You see, it's pretty simple, it's just 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:13.140
 screw 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.219
 to the boiler 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.049
 and here we see how he is putting the 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.049
 screws 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.049
 Which replaces 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.880
 to the previous 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.630
 well here is proceeding to squeeze 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.630
 the screws 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.520
 i 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:54.129
 well and here we see the results of the 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.129
 piece and bet 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:02.610
 which the new burner will be installed 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:06.420
 there as is and those screws when 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:10.230
 need to take out the plate and be able 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:14.780
 clean the ash the result of the the 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:16.770
 Burner to burn the country 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.450
 to get there 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.450
 the electrical mechanism will be the same 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:30.640
 so here we see for the moment finished 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:33.850
 the installation of the piece as you see the 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.120
 Blacksmith has done a job and the 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:41.010
 result would be 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:44.819
 and we can check how it is when 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:47.459
 let's have the new electric 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:51.220
 these same boiler cables will go 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:54.650
 plugged into our engine 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:58.099
 therefore up here 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.600
 the senate of the second part of this 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:02.860
 installation 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:08.180
 then tomorrow morning 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:11.350
 come the person in charge 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:17.739
 for install 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:21.930
 the auger the bucket and the whole mechanism 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.930
 that will be adapted to this new 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:28.960
 and until here 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.960
 It is the end of this second part 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.430
 of this installation
