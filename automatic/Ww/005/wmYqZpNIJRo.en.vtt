00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 since alfonso picked the first 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.490
 official tricks of the sims 4 the year 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.230
 passed on the creators cam 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.120
 we have been witnessing how the 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.650
 list was increasing and also how 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.330
 increased the number of visits to 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.190
 compilation of those tricks in small 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.839
 sims so I set out to make you a 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.430
 surprise gift when we reach the 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.020
 quarter of a million visits after 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.910
 about a month of work and 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.560
 50,000 more visits I can finally 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.570
 present you the small tricks guide 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.490
 without a guide ready to print and 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.140
 consult whenever you need it with 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.420
 absolutely all the tricks that are 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.980
 know today for the 4 sims and 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.780
 I do not need to limit my game or 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.370
 that you learn strange commands the 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.329
 You will have on hand to consult in 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.329
 any time 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.900
 You can download it in pdf from the link 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.610
 that I leave you right here you will have to 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.800
 print it on five double-sided folios 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.870
 in the order in which the size of the 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.940
 leaves is typical to four as the idea 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.770
 is that once printed the folios 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.080
 in half and it looks like a little book 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.430
 I recommend you do it like that because if 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.500
 you will not see that the leaves are left 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.570
 messy if your printer can not 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.610
 print without trimmed edges once 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.440
 you have everything printed the ideal would be 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.330
 that you will use a card for the cover 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.740
 and for the interior paper of the best 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.750
 quality that I catch is so that it does not 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.310
 go through the back but good in the 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.259
 photos see that we have used folios 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.509
 normal for the inside pages and 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.400
 it's been pretty good finally 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.259
 you want you can overlap the leaves by the 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.180
 center if you have a stapler that you 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.890
 allows you to do it or bind it 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.570
 some other way in the example that 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.000
 you are seeing in the photos we have used a 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.190
 couple of threads as you see the tricks are 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.410
 sorted by function many of them do not 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.750
 they are official some will have the icon 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.910
 to work camping or the day of 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.680
 spa that obviously indicates that trick 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.840
 It only works if you have the pack 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.360
 corresponding you will also find a 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.069
 section of keyboard shortcuts or also 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.790
 called quick keys sure that 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:59.490
 you find one who does not 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.350
 and finally a page for your notes 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.300
 as its name suggests thought so that 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.160
 note what you want and also for 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.020
 that you add tricks in the future according to 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.700
 go out more I intend to 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.259
 update this guide from time to time 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.300
 but not every time a trick comes out 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.920
 new and I do not think you do not want either 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.530
 have to reprint every two for three 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.450
 if some trick does not work for you remember 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.190
 activate the testing first if you have it 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.810
 on the first page and review also 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.000
 that he wrote it at face value 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.040
 the tricks are proven so 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.740
 they should still work if you're 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.910
 desperate leave us a comment 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.370
 preferably on the web and we will try 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.650
 help you if you find any crouching 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.020
 please contact us to correct it 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.000
 for future versions and of course you 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.370
 opinion will also be welcome how 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.620
 let's improve but I want to thank 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.480
 Siberian victory and Alfonso by 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.120
 to work hard to help me try 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.340
 the tricks and even the assembly of the 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.170
 back cover the last proof 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.420
 of printing and the photos that you are 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.890
 watching on screen and abel for creating me 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.930
 the two is that you can see in the 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.850
 back cover of truth I hope that you 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.290
 I liked the surprise although I 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.090
 have stolen a lot of time for the 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.390
 channel and that you remember me every time 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.300
 what 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.550
