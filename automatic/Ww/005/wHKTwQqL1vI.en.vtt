start twisting and I'm gonna try to

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.020

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
twist as tight as I can because it will

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:02.820

eventually<00:01:55.210> loosen<00:01:55.960> up<00:02:01.289> so<00:02:02.289> as<00:02:02.440> lessee<00:02:02.770> I

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
eventually loosen up so as lessee I

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.499 
eventually loosen up so as lessee I
added<00:02:03.130> more<00:02:03.310> product<00:02:03.700> to<00:02:03.789> the<00:02:03.880> bottom<00:02:04.179> of<00:02:04.330> my

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:06.300 
added more product to the bottom of my
hair<00:02:04.780> because<00:02:05.020> that's<00:02:05.860> how<00:02:06.009> you<00:02:06.070> get<00:02:06.250> a

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
hair because that's how you get a

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:13.210 
hair because that's how you get a
defined<00:02:06.880> twist<00:02:07.509> out<00:02:07.750> without<00:02:08.050> frizz

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.770
