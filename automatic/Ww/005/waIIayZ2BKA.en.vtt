00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 the best weapon in the world in its class 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.680
 how many can not speak here report 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.530
 from the secret division capable 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.750
 visited terribly anyone and what 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.059
 anti missile against 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.640
 the ravens cannot knock him where 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.490
 placed on the Iskander rocket 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.590
 But about some sense as they say 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.580
 others are loudly viewed in 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.949
 case studies 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.230
 for example ongoing construction 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.670
 the same American pro in Europe on 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.980
 presidential press conference in 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.110
 Thursday and we understandably return to it 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.430
 Today , Putin has often been asked about 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.950
 our rocket iskander 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.469
 supposedly already placed in Kaliningrad 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.070
 area be he reassured everyone decision 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.020
 This is but it is not yet accepted 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.360
 This recalled that our missiles Iskander 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.800
 The most effective weapon in the world in its 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.199
 segment about rockets and where they already 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.510
 posted report Nikolai Vasiliev but 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.879
 formerly one significant detail 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.090
 Iskander is only part of our complex 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.420
 defense since the threat is complex and 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.640
 the answer will be the same, this actually 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.330
 a thought was made recently and in 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.510
 message 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.330
 we all understand we know that 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.850
 you need and everything you need to answer is, 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.850
 and now specifically the area of ​​offices 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.700
 iskander never appears anywhere in 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.049
 alone every missile complex 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.090
 necessarily accompany 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.149
 staff armored personnel carriers 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.950
 life support machines so 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.080
 intelligence group goes first 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.509
 come everywhere 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:42.049
 inspected the area where there are mines or 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:45.680
 there is no insert labels are not infected min 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:47.750
 no where will be one battery get up 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.210
 neither drive auxiliary cars 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.619
 Alex on conscription service in conscript 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.720
 to get directly on 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.090
 Iskander need to serve six months and 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.759
 show an excellent knowledge of the theory of technology 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.590
 difficult but if you understand anything difficult 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.810
 No, Mikhail first saw Iskander 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.970
 a year and a half ago the fighting machine so its 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.130
 inspired that after the end of urgent 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.190
 Service signed a contract when I came 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.380
 serve I have not seen the technique for the first time 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.180
 I was really interested in us 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.549
 We leave on alert I specifically combat 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.190
 readiness learning 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:21.019
 interestingly stayed on the contract here 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.400
 now the division of Iskander holds 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.400
 regular practical classes 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.560
 and what anti missile means 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.450
 its air defense cannot 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:39.120
 bring it down the mind of our designers this 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.540
 serious good weapon which 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.889
 entered service with the Russian army 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.349
 Iskander created to destroy any 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:48.269
 ground targets whether ammunition depot 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.340
 airfield or combat concentration 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.950
 technology absolute accuracy of destruction 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.530
 guaranteed in a radius of 50 to 500 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.609
 kilometers here it is operational tactical 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.709
 rocket complex 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:00.870
 Iskander is only one of the machines 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.010
 deployed in this part how many 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.530
 can not speak here 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.510
 military secret technology is very secret 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.370
 it is forbidden even to disclose exactly which 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.109
 the region of Russia we are now 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.840
 first Iskander entered service 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:14.939
 in 2006, as soon as it was established 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.379
 mass production of missile systems 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:18.359
 new generation have replaced 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.459
 obsolete technology throughout 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:21.810
 country 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.790
 in parallel with the rearmament of rocket 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.980
 parts of the presentation are changing rapidly 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.659
 about the soldiers be and the amount of battery 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.730
 management of food intake amount 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:32.459
 16 mpa battery primala chance arena like 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.530
 my frivolous menu is certainly far from 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.049
 restaurant but the choice is in the dining room 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.239
 fighters come to all finished kitchen 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:41.189
 chores from cleaning potatoes and clearance 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:44.900
 Buffet before washing dishes for a long time 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:44.900
 given to civilian specialists 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.120
 go to the barracks 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.790
 traditional iron beds are not visible 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.160
 The mattresses are also modern in the corner. 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.200
 expensive vacuum cleaners which houses you are far from 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.900
 each instead of a bath once a week 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.850
 Now showers on each floor use 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.250
 and when it is convenient here washing 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.830
 typewriter but such a picture in almost every 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.140
 parts, but to the tea room even the soldiers themselves 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.040
 not used even though she appeared a couple 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.780
 months ago 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.910
 nobody warned us we came 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.070
 from there jenna room we were all surprised 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.950
 the final rejoiced after dinner 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.740
 tea drinking loading missiles and again on the march 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.419
 practical work continues 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.480
 Iskander mobile enough rocket 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:31.480
 complex 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:38.329
 just what kind of car is this thanks to 

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:39.909
 the car feels that really 

00:04:38.329 --> 00:04:43.369
 you feel the homeland 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:45.229
 what is needed for the country what is it 

00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:47.449
 my profession to defend the homeland itself 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.399
 name of the missile complex speaking 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:51.339
 Iskander the ancient Arabs called 

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:52.909
 Macedonian king Alexander the Great 

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:56.179
 Alexander translated from Greek 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:58.309
 means defender Nikolai Vasiliev 

00:04:56.179 --> 00:04:58.789
 Yevgeny Kostin Dmitry Lukashevich to lead 

00:04:58.309 --> 00:05:01.609
 of the week 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:03.109
 Western Military District Sergey Shoigu 

00:05:01.609 --> 00:05:05.149
 stated today that next year 

00:05:03.109 --> 00:05:07.099
 will complete the deployment program 

00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:08.659
 troops on the ground of Franz Joseph and on the new 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:10.489
 earth this way according to the minister 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:12.889
 defense the whole arctic train will 

00:05:10.489 --> 00:05:14.749
 closed besides commented step 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:16.189
 appeared in the western publication press 

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:17.689
 about what our country has placed in 

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:19.819
 Kaliningrad region missile 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:21.829
 Iskander complexes as some consider 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:23.359
 European experts is the answer to Moscow 

00:05:21.829 --> 00:05:24.969
 on ongoing construction 

00:05:23.359 --> 00:05:28.159
 American pro in Europe 

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:31.959
 we don't sit we just don't look 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:34.009
 Our science is our designer factories 

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:37.789
 believe me 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:40.070
 work very effectively and that weapon 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:43.960
 which has 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:47.710
 Russian army she is powerful she is mobile 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:50.270
 it is effective and we have something to answer 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.480
 a big uproar about us 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.680
 which is not there just kind of Iskander 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.080
 the territory of the Russian Federation where 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.210
 we want to leave here rocket complexes 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.550
 Iskander can be placed where 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.380
 the country's leadership will consider it necessary so 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.720
 Minister of Defense commented today 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.730
 European media reports about the Russian 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.710
 the threat of Sergei Shoigu today met with 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.930
 Moscow students besides defense 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.650
 they were interested, of course, and the service of 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.880
 appeal report Peter Peter 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.890
 some are worried that along our 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.960
 western frontiers create and dense 

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.910
 large missile defense ring 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.730
 the noise came up that we were not there 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:27.440
 there iskander just kind of territory 

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.870
 Russian Federation where do we want to go there 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.300
 we put it this way for a start and today from 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.550
 Russian Defense Ministry followed the comment 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:37.130
 topics that caused quite a stir in 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:39.770
 Europe on the eve of the German media reported 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:41.270
 that Moscow most likely placed in 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:43.370
 Kaliningrad region missile 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.780
 Iskander complexes representative 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:47.960
 of the military department Igor korashenkov 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.850
 declared that the Iskander act on the stand 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.830
 in service in the western military district 

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:53.930
 but in which particular region and 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:56.540
 it remained unclear konashenkov only 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.730
 stressed that no agreements russia 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.830
 did not break and now the Europeans 

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:03.290
 forced to guess exactly where Moscow 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.830
 deployed missiles capable of carrying nuclear 

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.690
 weapon 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.160
 if really in Kaliningrad 

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.380
 areas then you are their range 

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:13.840
 theoretically all baltic 

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.840
 almost all of poland and part of germany 

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:20.150
 we will never allow this west 

00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:22.460
 moved to the stage of self-excitation today 

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:24.710
 German bild with reference to some 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.900
 secret satellite images with anxiety 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.520
 report new iskander who 

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.719
 Russia allegedly placed in 

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.999
 Kaliningrad region 

00:07:29.719 --> 00:07:34.009
 but min-defense on this information in any way 

00:07:31.999 --> 00:07:35.900
 did not respond our help 

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:38.060
 operational tactical missile system 

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.409
 Iskander can be equipped with conventional and 

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:42.139
 nuclear warheads 

00:07:39.409 --> 00:07:43.879
 range of damage to 500 kilometers he 

00:07:42.139 --> 00:07:45.830
 really able to easily 

00:07:43.879 --> 00:07:46.639
 intercept the US antimissile 

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.919
 cm3 

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:50.810
 which is so proud overseas so 

00:07:48.919 --> 00:07:53.349
 Russia will be able to strike back at 

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:53.349
 any case
