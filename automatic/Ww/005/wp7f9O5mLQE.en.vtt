they're<00:01:54.720> going<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.930> be<00:01:55.020> very<00:01:55.290> very<00:01:55.500> woody

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
they're going to be very very woody

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.620 
they're going to be very very woody
because<00:01:56.040> it's<00:01:56.430> put<00:01:56.610> all<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.759> its<00:01:57.030> energy<00:01:57.329> in

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
because it's put all of its energy in

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.039 
because it's put all of its energy in
the<00:01:58.079> tops<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:59.070> not<00:01:59.909> this<00:02:00.180> or<00:02:00.420> it's<00:02:00.689> best<00:02:00.960> to

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
the tops and not this or it's best to

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.440 
the tops and not this or it's best to
just<00:02:01.140> compost<00:02:01.770> this<00:02:02.130> unless<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.090> want<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.299> try

process these and you know take a couple

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.520 
process these and you know take a couple
of<00:02:20.269> you<00:02:21.269> know<00:02:21.330> possibly<00:02:21.810> up<00:02:21.989> to<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.170> couple<00:02:22.500> of

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
of you know possibly up to a couple of

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.890 
of you know possibly up to a couple of
weeks<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:23.069> get<00:02:23.190> these<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.550> dry<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.090> onion

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
weeks to get these to dry and onion

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.009 
weeks to get these to dry and onion
seeds<00:02:25.200> are<00:02:25.860> safely<00:02:26.310> safely<00:02:26.970> viable<00:02:27.510> for<00:02:27.750> about

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
seeds are safely safely viable for about

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.740 
seeds are safely safely viable for about
a<00:02:28.050> year<00:02:28.349> so<00:02:28.380> you<00:02:29.040> can<00:02:29.160> say<00:02:29.400> these<00:02:29.730> allow<00:02:30.569> them

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
a year so you can say these allow them

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.140 
a year so you can say these allow them
to<00:02:30.870> go<00:02:31.050> through<00:02:31.230> their<00:02:31.349> cold<00:02:31.590> cycle<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:32.250> then

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
to go through their cold cycle and then

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.990 
to go through their cold cycle and then
you<00:02:33.660> can<00:02:33.840> plant<00:02:34.560> them<00:02:34.590> next<00:02:34.830> year<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:35.400> you

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
you can plant them next year and you

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.720 
you can plant them next year and you
maybe<00:02:36.269> be<00:02:36.480> able<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:37.080> get<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.260> year<00:02:37.890> or<00:02:38.160> two<00:02:38.489> years

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
maybe be able to get a year or two years

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.820 
maybe be able to get a year or two years
out<00:02:38.910> of<00:02:38.970> it<00:02:39.239> but<00:02:39.690> it's<00:02:39.810> best<00:02:40.019> to<00:02:40.140> try<00:02:40.380> to<00:02:40.410> use<00:02:40.650> as

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
out of it but it's best to try to use as

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.920 
out of it but it's best to try to use as
much<00:02:41.099> of<00:02:41.129> the<00:02:41.489> onion<00:02:41.819> seeds<00:02:42.060> from<00:02:42.569> year<00:02:42.810> to

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
much of the onion seeds from year to

much of the onion seeds from year to
year<00:02:42.959> as<00:02:43.170> possible<00:02:43.590> instead<00:02:43.769> of<00:02:43.890> try<00:02:44.010> to<00:02:44.069> hold

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
year as possible instead of try to hold

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.850 
year as possible instead of try to hold
on<00:02:44.459> it<00:02:44.610> for<00:02:44.760> long-term<00:02:45.000> storage<00:02:45.690> so<00:02:46.530> we'll<00:02:46.739> go

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
on it for long-term storage so we'll go

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.160 
on it for long-term storage so we'll go
ahead<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:47.130> get<00:02:47.340> these<00:02:47.549> set<00:02:48.390> up<00:02:48.569> allow<00:02:48.959> them<00:02:49.080> to

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
ahead and get these set up allow them to

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.199 
ahead and get these set up allow them to
dry<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:49.650> then<00:02:49.980> once<00:02:50.130> they've<00:02:50.400> dried<00:02:50.640> you<00:02:51.000> just

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
dry and then once they've dried you just

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.150 
dry and then once they've dried you just
take<00:02:51.360> them<00:02:51.540> in<00:02:51.599> your<00:02:51.750> hand<00:02:52.049> and<00:02:52.319> you'll<00:02:52.980> have
