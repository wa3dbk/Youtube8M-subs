00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
textures and other stuff like that I was

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.059 
textures and other stuff like that I was
looking<00:03:58.079> around<00:03:58.200> for<00:03:58.470> like<00:03:58.590> some<00:03:58.799> kind<00:03:59.010> of

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
looking around for like some kind of

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:00.619 
looking around for like some kind of
submarine<00:03:59.579> and<00:03:59.760> a<00:03:59.819> reference<00:04:00.209> to<00:04:00.359> call<00:04:00.480> the

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
submarine and a reference to call the

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:03.050 
submarine and a reference to call the
dead<00:04:00.810> bottom<00:04:01.260> I<00:04:01.500> found<00:04:02.220> nothing<00:04:02.609> there<00:04:02.970> was

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
dead bottom I found nothing there was

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.180 
dead bottom I found nothing there was
nothing<00:04:03.150> over<00:04:03.389> there<00:04:03.690> now<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.739> one<00:04:04.950> thing

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
nothing over there now the one thing

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.710 
nothing over there now the one thing
which<00:04:05.340> mainly<00:04:05.549> interested<00:04:05.940> me<00:04:06.329> about<00:04:06.569> this

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
which mainly interested me about this

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.659 
which mainly interested me about this
map<00:04:07.019> is<00:04:07.049> that<00:04:07.199> it<00:04:07.470> maybe<00:04:08.000> two<00:04:09.000> references<00:04:09.660> to

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:10.669 
map is that it maybe two references to

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:13.580 
map is that it maybe two references to
youtubers<00:04:11.669> which<00:04:12.030> are<00:04:12.299> not<00:04:12.569> too<00:04:13.379> positive

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
youtubers which are not too positive

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.879 
youtubers which are not too positive
about<00:04:13.859> is<00:04:14.129> probably<00:04:14.400> just<00:04:15.410> random<00:04:16.410> names<00:04:16.739> when

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
about is probably just random names when

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.379 
about is probably just random names when
you<00:04:16.949> got<00:04:17.070> Jonas<00:04:17.549> there<00:04:17.760> which<00:04:17.970> probably<00:04:18.209> means

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
you got Jonas there which probably means

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:19.479 
you got Jonas there which probably means
Jonas<00:04:18.840> Brothers<00:04:19.169> or

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
Jonas Brothers or

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.159 
Jonas Brothers or
nothing<00:04:20.060> else<00:04:20.209> cuz<00:04:20.449> they're<00:04:20.660> not<00:04:20.810> they<00:04:21.049> know

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
nothing else cuz they're not they know

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.980 
nothing else cuz they're not they know
anything<00:04:21.380> do<00:04:21.590> aut<00:04:21.859> I'm<00:04:22.099> pretty<00:04:22.280> sure<00:04:22.460> but<00:04:23.300> the

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
anything do aut I'm pretty sure but the

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.960 
anything do aut I'm pretty sure but the
weird<00:04:24.199> thing<00:04:24.319> I<00:04:24.680> found<00:04:24.949> looked<00:04:25.460> all<00:04:25.639> around

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
weird thing I found looked all around

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.760 
weird thing I found looked all around
the<00:04:26.090> map<00:04:26.300> and<00:04:26.539> I<00:04:26.630> saw<00:04:26.780> these<00:04:27.020> bottles<00:04:27.590> called

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
the map and I saw these bottles called

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.010 
the map and I saw these bottles called
Sparkle<00:04:28.190> zone<00:04:28.430> and<00:04:29.240> I<00:04:29.569> was<00:04:29.720> looking<00:04:29.960> around

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
Sparkle zone and I was looking around

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.200 
Sparkle zone and I was looking around
and<00:04:30.349> I<00:04:30.470> pretty<00:04:30.680> much<00:04:30.770> never<00:04:31.250> saw<00:04:31.639> one<00:04:31.970> of<00:04:32.090> these

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
and I pretty much never saw one of these

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.570 
and I pretty much never saw one of these
bottles<00:04:32.449> apart<00:04:32.930> from<00:04:33.050> this<00:04:33.199> one<00:04:33.580> facing

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
bottles apart from this one facing

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.279 
bottles apart from this one facing
directly<00:04:34.910> to<00:04:35.270> you<00:04:35.509> all<00:04:35.690> the<00:04:35.840> other<00:04:35.960> bottles

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:36.289 
directly to you all the other bottles

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:38.050 
directly to you all the other bottles
were<00:04:36.380> pointing<00:04:36.710> to<00:04:36.830> the<00:04:37.310> sign<00:04:37.550> door<00:04:37.849> turned

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
were pointing to the sign door turned

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.129 
were pointing to the sign door turned
around<00:04:38.210> completely

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
around completely

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:41.350 
around completely
and<00:04:39.229> so<00:04:39.710> Sparkle<00:04:40.160> zone<00:04:40.370> may<00:04:40.910> be<00:04:40.970> a<00:04:41.090> reference

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
and so Sparkle zone may be a reference

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.040 
and so Sparkle zone may be a reference
to<00:04:41.479> captain<00:04:41.870> sparkles<00:04:42.289> on<00:04:42.590> the<00:04:42.860> YouTube<00:04:44.050> but

we also have a nice big crab right there

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:48.730 
we also have a nice big crab right there
it<00:04:47.030> means<00:04:47.180> nothing<00:04:47.449> but<00:04:47.780> also<00:04:47.960> this<00:04:48.259> the<00:04:48.530> wine

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479 
that it's a distillery from Manchester

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:04.420 
that it's a distillery from Manchester
in<00:05:02.659> the<00:05:02.690> UK<00:05:02.810> which<00:05:03.470> might<00:05:03.650> be<00:05:03.860> something<00:05:04.009> to<00:05:04.310> do

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
in the UK which might be something to do

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.520 
in the UK which might be something to do
a<00:05:04.460> syndicate<00:05:05.000> project<00:05:05.090> you<00:05:05.509> know<00:05:05.630> no<00:05:05.840> but

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
a syndicate project you know no but

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.980 
a syndicate project you know no but
that's<00:05:06.650> something<00:05:06.979> interesting<00:05:07.490> right<00:05:07.520> there

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
that's something interesting right there

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.290 
that's something interesting right there
those<00:05:09.319> two<00:05:09.530> things<00:05:09.800> and<00:05:10.400> I<00:05:10.520> believe<00:05:10.970> that's

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
those two things and I believe that's

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.120 
those two things and I believe that's
everything<00:05:11.599> that<00:05:11.990> exactly<00:05:12.470> wanted<00:05:12.860> to<00:05:12.949> show

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
everything that exactly wanted to show

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.499 
everything that exactly wanted to show
you<00:05:13.190> although<00:05:13.430> I<00:05:13.460> should<00:05:13.729> probably<00:05:13.909> go<00:05:14.210> over

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:14.509 
you although I should probably go over

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:18.700 
you although I should probably go over
to<00:05:14.690> the<00:05:16.030> place<00:05:17.030> where<00:05:17.300> has<00:05:17.479> all<00:05:17.720> the<00:05:17.960> sparkles

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
to the place where has all the sparkles

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.149 
to the place where has all the sparkles
bottles<00:05:19.069> and<00:05:20.380> the<00:05:21.380> ones<00:05:21.620> we<00:05:21.740> don't<00:05:21.919> even

00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:22.159 
bottles and the ones we don't even

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:24.969 
bottles and the ones we don't even
facing<00:05:22.400> you<00:05:22.819> so<00:05:23.360> you<00:05:24.139> know<00:05:24.259> just<00:05:24.560> that<00:05:24.680> one

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979 
facing you so you know just that one

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:26.560 
facing you so you know just that one
bottle<00:05:25.280> seems<00:05:25.639> to<00:05:25.759> be<00:05:25.849> the<00:05:25.969> easiest<00:05:26.240> one<00:05:26.539> to

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
bottle seems to be the easiest one to

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.950 
bottle seems to be the easiest one to
see<00:05:26.930> big<00:05:27.860> totem<00:05:28.219> pole<00:05:28.400> which<00:05:28.719> probably<00:05:29.719> means

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
see big totem pole which probably means

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.709 
see big totem pole which probably means
nothing<00:05:30.530> at<00:05:30.620> all<00:05:30.820> the<00:05:31.820> snowman<00:05:32.210> I<00:05:32.330> destroyed

00:05:32.709 --> 00:05:32.719 
nothing at all the snowman I destroyed

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:35.320 
nothing at all the snowman I destroyed
earlier<00:05:32.930> because<00:05:33.409> fuck<00:05:33.590> him<00:05:34.060> this<00:05:35.060> is<00:05:35.210> the

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
earlier because fuck him this is the

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.980 
earlier because fuck him this is the
room<00:05:35.539> with<00:05:35.780> all<00:05:36.020> the<00:05:36.289> sparkles<00:05:36.949> bottles<00:05:37.990> which

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
room with all the sparkles bottles which

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.350 
room with all the sparkles bottles which
you<00:05:39.380> know<00:05:39.530> that's<00:05:40.490> facing<00:05:40.820> to<00:05:41.060> the<00:05:41.090> side

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
you know that's facing to the side

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.990 
you know that's facing to the side
that's<00:05:41.659> facing<00:05:41.900> away<00:05:42.259> that's<00:05:43.159> the<00:05:43.370> closest

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
that's facing away that's the closest

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.499 
that's facing away that's the closest
one<00:05:44.210> which<00:05:44.509> is<00:05:44.690> not<00:05:45.020> facing<00:05:45.940> away<00:05:46.940> it's<00:05:47.449> just

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:47.509 
one which is not facing away it's just

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:49.899 
one which is not facing away it's just
like<00:05:47.780> right<00:05:48.020> there<00:05:48.259> facing<00:05:49.190> away<00:05:49.280> facing<00:05:49.789> away

00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:49.909 
like right there facing away facing away

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:53.110 
like right there facing away facing away
all<00:05:50.210> of<00:05:50.330> them<00:05:50.419> are<00:05:50.569> facing<00:05:50.900> away<00:05:51.400> and<00:05:52.400> so<00:05:52.639> no<00:05:53.090> I

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
all of them are facing away and so no I

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.180 
all of them are facing away and so no I
thought<00:05:53.449> of<00:05:53.630> that<00:05:53.810> one<00:05:54.259> bottle<00:05:54.530> in<00:05:54.770> that<00:05:54.800> room

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
thought of that one bottle in that room

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.850 
thought of that one bottle in that room
was<00:05:55.479> somewhat<00:05:56.479> delivery<00:05:56.840> in<00:05:56.990> some<00:05:57.199> way<00:05:57.380> but<00:05:57.620> um

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
was somewhat delivery in some way but um

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
was somewhat delivery in some way but um
that's<00:05:58.759> pretty<00:05:59.000> much<00:05:59.150> all<00:05:59.330> I'm<00:05:59.509> white<00:05:59.719> out

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
that's pretty much all I'm white out

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.499 
that's pretty much all I'm white out
nothing<00:06:01.880> too<00:06:02.300> important<00:06:03.229> but<00:06:03.409> I<00:06:03.440> think<00:06:03.500> that

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:04.509 
nothing too important but I think that

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:07.149 
nothing too important but I think that
no<00:06:05.509> obviously<00:06:05.960> they're<00:06:06.199> not<00:06:06.380> as<00:06:06.560> good<00:06:06.740> at

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:07.159 
no obviously they're not as good at

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:11.339 
no obviously they're not as good at
hiding<00:06:07.550> little<00:06:08.090> things<00:06:08.330> on<00:06:09.280> these<00:06:10.280> maps<00:06:10.699> as

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:11.349 
hiding little things on these maps as

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:13.209 
hiding little things on these maps as
Treyarch<00:06:12.349> wear<00:06:12.530> on<00:06:12.650> their<00:06:12.830> mouths<00:06:13.039> because<00:06:13.099> I

00:06:13.209 --> 00:06:13.219 
Treyarch wear on their mouths because I

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:15.850 
Treyarch wear on their mouths because I
had<00:06:13.370> bit<00:06:13.550> more<00:06:13.699> backstory<00:06:14.150> buts<00:06:14.780> in<00:06:15.440> the<00:06:15.740> new

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
had bit more backstory buts in the new

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.129 
had bit more backstory buts in the new
map<00:06:16.069> packs<00:06:16.340> and<00:06:17.000> they<00:06:17.330> will<00:06:17.539> probably<00:06:17.930> have

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:18.139 
map packs and they will probably have

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:20.050 
map packs and they will probably have
those<00:06:18.560> extinction<00:06:19.130> eggs<00:06:19.310> lying<00:06:19.580> around<00:06:19.759> which

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:20.060 
those extinction eggs lying around which

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.209 
those extinction eggs lying around which
are<00:06:20.270> very<00:06:20.960> interesting<00:06:21.590> and<00:06:21.740> fun<00:06:21.949> like<00:06:22.190> that

00:06:22.209 --> 00:06:22.219 
are very interesting and fun like that

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:24.700 
are very interesting and fun like that
but<00:06:22.669> um<00:06:22.900> that's<00:06:23.900> pretty<00:06:24.139> much<00:06:24.259> all<00:06:24.409> for<00:06:24.469> this

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:24.710 
but um that's pretty much all for this

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.709 
but um that's pretty much all for this
map<00:06:25.069> and<00:06:25.580> if<00:06:26.060> you<00:06:26.120> go<00:06:26.210> into<00:06:26.330> the<00:06:26.449> water<00:06:26.630> you

00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:26.719 
map and if you go into the water you

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:28.329 
map and if you go into the water you
will<00:06:26.900> die<00:06:27.020> but<00:06:27.289> anyway<00:06:27.710> thank<00:06:27.919> your<00:06:28.070> watering
