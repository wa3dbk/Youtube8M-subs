out and locate and catch blue catfish
now<00:01:40.259> most<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.040> time<00:01:41.250> those<00:01:41.759> bait<00:01:42.060> fish<00:01:42.390> are

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
now most of the time those bait fish are

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.469 
now most of the time those bait fish are
going<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.439> be<00:01:43.500> threadfin<00:01:44.310> shad<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:45.119> gizzard

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.780 
going to be threadfin shad and gizzard
shad<00:01:45.509> now<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:46.979> know<00:01:47.040> there's<00:01:47.250> other<00:01:47.490> bait

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
shad now you know there's other bait

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.870 
shad now you know there's other bait
fish<00:01:48.060> obviously<00:01:48.390> as<00:01:48.899> well<00:01:49.140> but<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:50.549> know<00:01:50.640> the

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
fish obviously as well but you know the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.850 
fish obviously as well but you know the
vast<00:01:51.180> majority<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.079> country<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.649> has

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
vast majority of the country that has

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.880 
vast majority of the country that has
blue<00:01:53.159> catfish<00:01:53.700> populations<00:01:54.540> has<00:01:55.110> threadfin

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
blue catfish populations has threadfin

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.609 
blue catfish populations has threadfin
and<00:01:56.280> gizzard<00:01:56.579> shad<00:01:56.659> populations<00:01:57.659> as<00:01:57.840> well<00:01:57.869> so

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
and gizzard shad populations as well so

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.330 
and gizzard shad populations as well so
if<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.850> can<00:02:00.090> go<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.600> learn<00:02:01.020> in<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.920> most

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
if you can go and learn in the most

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.410 
if you can go and learn in the most
basic<00:02:02.820> form<00:02:03.450> how<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.409> find<00:02:05.329> schools<00:02:06.329> of<00:02:06.630> shad

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
basic form how to find schools of shad

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.559 
basic form how to find schools of shad
then<00:02:09.420> start<00:02:09.869> looking<00:02:10.170> in<00:02:10.590> those<00:02:10.950> areas<00:02:11.610> for

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
then start looking in those areas for

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.539 
then start looking in those areas for
blue<00:02:12.840> catfish<00:02:13.379> and<00:02:13.590> that's<00:02:13.890> going<00:02:14.099> to<00:02:14.220> really

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
blue catfish and that's going to really

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:18.350 
blue catfish and that's going to really
shorten<00:02:15.180> your<00:02:15.840> curve<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.530> go<00:02:16.680> out<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:17.360> finding

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
shorten your curve to go out and finding

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.559 
shorten your curve to go out and finding
these<00:02:18.569> fish<00:02:18.959> now<00:02:19.319> there<00:02:20.069> may<00:02:20.340> be<00:02:20.400> fish<00:02:20.819> all<00:02:21.120> up

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
these fish now there may be fish all up

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.589 
these fish now there may be fish all up
in<00:02:21.870> those<00:02:22.440> schools<00:02:22.799> are<00:02:22.950> shed<00:02:23.250> they<00:02:24.239> may<00:02:24.540> be

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
in those schools are shed they may be

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.530 
in those schools are shed they may be
fished<00:02:25.019> near<00:02:25.379> them<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.849> you<00:02:26.849> may<00:02:27.060> not<00:02:27.269> find

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
fished near them and you may not find

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.910 
fished near them and you may not find
any<00:02:27.870> at<00:02:27.989> all<00:02:28.170> for<00:02:28.739> a<00:02:28.769> while<00:02:29.239> but<00:02:30.239> I<00:02:30.709> promise<00:02:31.709> you
