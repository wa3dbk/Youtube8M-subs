00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
totally killing it with i pretty much it

totally killing it with i pretty much it
really<00:01:30.079> comes<00:01:30.380> down<00:01:30.439> to<00:01:30.560> two<00:01:31.189> main<00:01:31.579> things<00:01:31.939> and

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
really comes down to two main things and

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.389 
really comes down to two main things and
that<00:01:32.329> is<00:01:32.509> its<00:01:32.780> technology<00:01:33.499> that<00:01:33.679> he<00:01:33.770> uses<00:01:34.159> the

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
that is its technology that he uses the

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:36.219 
that is its technology that he uses the
sensors<00:01:34.789> and<00:01:34.820> everything<00:01:35.659> that<00:01:35.780> goes<00:01:35.869> into<00:01:36.079> it

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
sensors and everything that goes into it

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.380 
sensors and everything that goes into it
i'll<00:01:36.320> break<00:01:36.469> that<00:01:36.679> down<00:01:36.890> and<00:01:37.130> two<00:01:37.579> is<00:01:37.700> its<00:01:37.880> size

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
i'll break that down and two is its size

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.330

thought it was maybe a defect and i got
a<00:04:41.120> new<00:04:41.300> one<00:04:41.450> and<00:04:41.660> it's<00:04:41.750> the<00:04:41.900> exact<00:04:42.230> same<00:04:42.320> thing

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
a new one and it's the exact same thing

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.230 
a new one and it's the exact same thing
and<00:04:42.950> i'm<00:04:43.040> even<00:04:43.310> hear<00:04:43.520> that<00:04:43.669> from<00:04:43.880> i<00:04:44.060> know<00:04:44.120> a

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240

the<00:04:46.640> sony<00:04:46.880> a7s<00:04:47.780> i<00:04:48.289> think<00:04:48.620> he's<00:04:48.890> got<00:04:49.070> like<00:04:49.280> eight

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
the sony a7s i think he's got like eight

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:50.559 
the sony a7s i think he's got like eight
batteries<00:04:49.940> because<00:04:50.180> the

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:50.569 
batteries because the

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:52.570 
batteries because the
batteries<00:04:50.929> just<00:04:50.960> churn<00:04:51.710> through<00:04:52.039> so<00:04:52.339> quickly

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
batteries just churn through so quickly

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.760 
batteries just churn through so quickly
that's<00:04:53.270> one<00:04:53.449> of<00:04:53.539> the<00:04:53.629> biggest<00:04:53.929> things<00:04:54.379> the<00:04:54.559> low

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
that's one of the biggest things the low

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.279 
that's one of the biggest things the low
capacity<00:04:55.339> batteries<00:04:55.759> that<00:04:55.969> these<00:04:56.389> mirrorless

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:57.289 
capacity batteries that these mirrorless

00:04:57.289 --> 00:04:58.989 
capacity batteries that these mirrorless
cameras<00:04:57.679> have<00:04:57.860> expressly<00:04:58.219> the<00:04:58.429> Sony's<00:04:58.819> are

cameras have expressly the Sony's are

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:01.179 
cameras have expressly the Sony's are
not<00:04:59.809> that<00:05:00.110> good<00:05:00.439> so<00:05:00.709> that's<00:05:00.889> one<00:05:01.039> of<00:05:01.069> the

00:05:01.179 --> 00:05:01.189 
not that good so that's one of the

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:02.889 
not that good so that's one of the
biggest<00:05:01.399> things<00:05:01.699> and<00:05:01.909> why<00:05:02.029> I<00:05:02.059> can't<00:05:02.689> really

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:02.899 
biggest things and why I can't really

00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:04.179 
biggest things and why I can't really

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:06.780 
soz 4k video and the problem is i think

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.090 
soz 4k video and the problem is i think
they<00:07:07.050> rushed<00:07:07.380> it<00:07:07.560> out<00:07:07.680> there<00:07:07.860> and<00:07:07.949> everything

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:08.100 
they rushed it out there and everything

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.040 
they rushed it out there and everything
like<00:07:08.340> that<00:07:08.400> because<00:07:08.729> i<00:07:09.090> think<00:07:09.180> that<00:07:09.449> does<00:07:09.630> 20

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:10.050 
like that because i think that does 20

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.680 
like that because i think that does 20
or<00:07:10.139> 25<00:07:10.620> minutes<00:07:11.009> of<00:07:11.130> recording<00:07:11.430> video<00:07:11.940> at<00:07:12.120> 4k

or 25 minutes of recording video at 4k
but<00:07:13.199> the<00:07:13.349> damn<00:07:13.590> thing<00:07:13.830> overheats<00:07:14.430> and<00:07:14.580> shuts

00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:14.669 
but the damn thing overheats and shuts

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:16.460 
but the damn thing overheats and shuts
down<00:07:15.000> your<00:07:15.210> camera<00:07:15.509> I<00:07:15.539> think<00:07:15.810> it<00:07:15.930> averages<00:07:16.410> of

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:16.470 
down your camera I think it averages of

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:18.439 
down your camera I think it averages of
16<00:07:17.160> minutes<00:07:17.550> so<00:07:17.970> you're<00:07:18.090> not<00:07:18.180> even<00:07:18.360> getting

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:18.449 
16 minutes so you're not even getting

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:19.790 
16 minutes so you're not even getting
full<00:07:18.780> records<00:07:19.319> you're<00:07:19.440> getting<00:07:19.590> corrupted

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:19.800 
full records you're getting corrupted

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.890 
full records you're getting corrupted
files<00:07:20.220> because<00:07:20.460> your<00:07:21.060> files<00:07:21.300> are<00:07:21.479> you<00:07:21.599> doing

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:21.900 
files because your files are you doing
