00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.310
 voices of the radio scoreboard 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.590

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.550

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.800
 radio and for the dissemination of his music 

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:36.219

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.149
 pole music because we got in the car 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:40.370
 Legal from caruaru 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.949
 much of our time is spent 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:47.350
 we often have inside the car and with 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:49.370
 side work and radio is a company 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.280
 more or less 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.979
 after work like it has nine 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.739
 musical and radio this is my job 

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:59.989
 together, but our moment I 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:05.750
 I think the good time of television that I 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:08.960
 social and therefore not only are 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.960
 inside the car from work so wrong and 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:17.719
 and the songs forever but always by 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:20.329
 behind and stays the head has this notion that 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:26.240
 is radio in the local chains are very 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:29.350
 found and dance in music on the radio 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.350
 if the media 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.210
 nelson freitas also highly anticipated 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.649
 shocked the public with great successes 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.720
 good honey 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.909
 one of the situations that most marked the 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.610
 Singer in her long career 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:50.299
 It was just because you 've seen and 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:54.470
 traffic because traffic generates 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:57.860
 very hot and I was giving a song 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.750
 My radio was not coming to 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.060
 But the lady next door 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.580
 I was singing and singing when I 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.000
 I call but it was even three or four 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.560
 years 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.229
 so to sing when I call this 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.260
 call me, smile, look, it's going to be 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.190
 looked at me like this was not doing 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.870
 lobby 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.810
 Look the movie made a face more show 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.549
 but may wait to contain or 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.830
 sang I loved the little things 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:25.030
 magic does not happen do not even know 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.680
 that should happen with 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.110
 fresh from arriving in France where 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.720
 to finalize the French disc of life generates 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.970
 has made the bidding on the pavilion 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:58.400
 told the news about the country that is 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:03:00.350
 welcome with open arms the life was 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.900
 one of the most important moments in 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.150
 intense week of party twice 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.459
 to stage your fans to sleep 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.459
 so much neglect 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:18.550
 I hope to have this because my 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.480
 is portuguese 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:24.160
 and the fact that in this sense this is 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:28.209
 willingness to remain ahead of the 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.400
 championship but despite being betting 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.930

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:48.160
 vehicle that most promotes your music and

 France also will now go out and get

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.530

 also the blue tata already passes more than 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:07.680
