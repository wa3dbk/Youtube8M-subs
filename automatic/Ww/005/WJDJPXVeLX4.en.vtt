00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
you that the worst part of the job is

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:33.509 
you that the worst part of the job is
the<00:02:17.890> mess<00:02:18.190> of<00:02:18.400> makes<00:02:31.829> here<00:02:32.829> you<00:02:32.950> see<00:02:33.160> the<00:02:33.310> ackee

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
the mess of makes here you see the ackee

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:39.000 
the mess of makes here you see the ackee
cutter<00:02:33.850> cuts<00:02:34.209> clean<00:02:34.600> and<00:02:35.290> leaves<00:02:35.560> no<00:02:35.739> mess<00:02:38.010> no

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
cutter cuts clean and leaves no mess no

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.620 
cutter cuts clean and leaves no mess no
mess<00:02:39.310> equals<00:02:39.880> no<00:02:40.120> waste

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
mess equals no waste

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.020 
mess equals no waste
so<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.350> Accu<00:02:41.620> cutter<00:02:41.799> needs<00:02:42.069> no<00:02:42.340> power<00:02:42.670> and

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
so the Accu cutter needs no power and

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.390 
so the Accu cutter needs no power and
produces<00:02:43.780> no<00:02:43.989> waste<00:02:44.290> which<00:02:44.950> makes<00:02:45.220> it

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
produces no waste which makes it

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.309 
produces no waste which makes it
environmentally<00:02:46.269> friendly<00:02:46.660> as<00:02:46.750> well<00:02:46.959> and

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
environmentally friendly as well and

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.259 
environmentally friendly as well and
with<00:02:47.889> today's<00:02:48.190> trend<00:02:48.609> towards<00:02:49.030> green

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.300 
with today's trend towards green
building<00:02:49.799> environmentally<00:02:50.799> friendly<00:02:51.190> is

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
building environmentally friendly is

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.180 
building environmentally friendly is
what<00:02:51.489> it's<00:02:51.639> all<00:02:51.790> about<00:02:51.819> so<00:02:52.680> now<00:02:53.680> you<00:02:53.889> have<00:02:54.160> a

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
what it's all about so now you have a

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.839 
what it's all about so now you have a
tool<00:02:54.459> that's<00:02:54.519> fast<00:02:55.120> fade<00:02:56.079> and<00:02:56.430> accurate

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
tool that's fast fade and accurate

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.809 
tool that's fast fade and accurate
it<00:02:58.090> requires<00:02:58.540> no<00:02:58.930> power<00:02:59.170> and<00:02:59.829> creates<00:03:00.219> no<00:03:00.489> dust

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
it requires no power and creates no dust

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.720 
it requires no power and creates no dust
there's<00:03:01.780> nothing<00:03:02.170> like<00:03:02.319> it

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
there's nothing like it

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.269 
there's nothing like it
