and I started playing like three dollars

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.530 
and I started playing like three dollars
six<00:02:39.660> dollar<00:02:40.010> no<00:02:41.010> one<00:02:41.160> that<00:02:41.280> hold<00:02:41.459> them<00:02:41.610> maybe

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
six dollar no one that hold them maybe

in<00:02:42.769> 2005<00:02:43.769> the<00:02:44.670> games<00:02:44.880> were<00:02:45.090> pretty<00:02:45.300> soft<00:02:45.540> back

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
in 2005 the games were pretty soft back

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:46.910 
in 2005 the games were pretty soft back
then<00:02:45.930> so<00:02:46.110> I<00:02:46.170> don't<00:02:46.320> think<00:02:46.410> he<00:02:46.530> had<00:02:46.680> to<00:02:46.769> be<00:02:46.890> a

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
then so I don't think he had to be a

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.290 
then so I don't think he had to be a
particularly<00:02:47.370> great<00:02:47.610> player<00:02:47.940> to<00:02:48.180> be

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
particularly great player to be

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.860 
particularly great player to be
successful<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:49.610> I<00:02:50.610> did<00:02:51.150> I<00:02:51.330> did<00:02:51.480> fairly<00:02:51.720> well

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
successful and I did I did fairly well

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.600 
successful and I did I did fairly well
and<00:02:52.320> kind<00:02:52.620> of<00:02:52.680> progress<00:02:52.830> up<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.190> ranks<00:02:53.310> pretty

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
and kind of progress up the ranks pretty

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.550 
and kind of progress up the ranks pretty
quickly

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
quickly

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.860 
quickly
and<00:02:54.770> just<00:02:55.370> kind<00:02:55.550> of<00:02:55.580> like<00:02:55.730> stayed<00:02:56.030> slightly

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
and just kind of like stayed slightly

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.210 
and just kind of like stayed slightly
ahead<00:02:57.020> the<00:02:57.560> whole<00:02:57.680> way<00:02:57.739> I<00:02:58.780> guess<00:02:59.780> I<00:03:00.220> started

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
ahead the whole way I guess I started

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.460 
ahead the whole way I guess I started
playing<00:03:01.550> pot<00:03:01.849> limit<00:03:01.970> Omaha<00:03:02.420> a<00:03:02.870> couple<00:03:03.380> years

like<00:03:37.250> my<00:03:37.400> foundation<00:03:37.880> of<00:03:37.970> PLO<00:03:38.360> I<00:03:38.569> started

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
like my foundation of PLO I started

working on that game a lot and kind of
played<00:03:41.090> that<00:03:41.239> primarily<00:03:41.630> for<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:41.989> last<00:03:42.140> four

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:42.349

played that primarily for the last four
years<00:03:42.380> I<00:03:50.319> mean<00:03:51.319> I<00:03:51.440> am<00:03:51.620> I<00:03:52.040> was<00:03:52.519> 27<00:03:53.030> of<00:03:53.239> 27<00:03:53.510> with

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
years I mean I am I was 27 of 27 with

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.870 
years I mean I am I was 27 of 27 with
three<00:03:54.110> tables<00:03:54.440> left<00:03:54.620> on<00:03:54.830> 9<00:03:55.040> of<00:03:55.069> 9<00:03:55.370> with<00:03:55.640> one

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
three tables left on 9 of 9 with one

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.150 
three tables left on 9 of 9 with one
table<00:03:56.180> left<00:03:56.209> I've<00:03:57.019> been<00:03:57.380> pretty<00:03:57.680> much<00:03:57.830> playing

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
table left I've been pretty much playing

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.530 
table left I've been pretty much playing
a<00:03:58.250> short<00:03:58.489> stack<00:03:58.730> for<00:03:58.880> the<00:03:58.970> last<00:03:59.180> three<00:03:59.390> or<00:03:59.420> four

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
a short stack for the last three or four

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.390 
a short stack for the last three or four
days<00:03:59.750> I<00:04:00.049> mean<00:04:00.890> I<00:04:00.950> feel<00:04:01.100> pretty<00:04:01.250> comfortable

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
days I mean I feel pretty comfortable

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.890 
days I mean I feel pretty comfortable
there<00:04:01.820> i<00:04:01.850> don't<00:04:01.970> i<00:04:02.209> think<00:04:02.390> i<00:04:02.450> play<00:04:02.660> a<00:04:02.690> little

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
there i don't i think i play a little

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:03.940 
there i don't i think i play a little
bit<00:04:03.079> differently<00:04:03.380> than<00:04:03.650> some<00:04:03.829> other

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
bit differently than some other

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.050 
bit differently than some other
tournament<00:04:04.310> players<00:04:04.489> who<00:04:04.760> would<00:04:04.880> just

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
tournament players who would just

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.390 
tournament players who would just
basically<00:04:05.630> play<00:04:06.079> all<00:04:06.290> inner<00:04:06.500> fold<00:04:06.769> style<00:04:07.130> i

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
basically play all inner fold style i

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.190 
basically play all inner fold style i
like<00:04:07.670> to<00:04:07.910> defend<00:04:08.180> my<00:04:08.269> big<00:04:08.450> blind<00:04:08.660> a<00:04:08.780> lot<00:04:08.930> i<00:04:08.959> like

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
like to defend my big blind a lot i like

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.069 
like to defend my big blind a lot i like
see<00:04:09.440> flops<00:04:09.739> like<00:04:10.069> what<00:04:10.340> turns<00:04:10.870> try<00:04:11.870> to<00:04:11.930> make

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
see flops like what turns try to make

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:13.690 
see flops like what turns try to make
better<00:04:12.260> decisions<00:04:12.500> on<00:04:12.950> later<00:04:13.160> streets<00:04:13.549> and

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
better decisions on later streets and

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.340 
better decisions on later streets and
other<00:04:13.790> players<00:04:14.090> would<00:04:14.420> who<00:04:14.660> aren't

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
other players would who aren't

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.840 
other players would who aren't
necessarily<00:04:15.680> used<00:04:16.010> to<00:04:16.190> seeing<00:04:16.459> turn<00:04:16.700> two

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
necessarily used to seeing turn two

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.029 
necessarily used to seeing turn two
rivers<00:04:17.120> because<00:04:17.390> they're<00:04:17.739> used<00:04:18.739> to<00:04:18.829> playing

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.039 
rivers because they're used to playing

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:22.330 
rivers because they're used to playing
more<00:04:19.340> all<00:04:19.519> inner<00:04:19.700> folds<00:04:19.850> strategy<00:04:20.919> so<00:04:21.919> i<00:04:21.950> mean

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
more all inner folds strategy so i mean

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.310 
more all inner folds strategy so i mean
i<00:04:22.400> think<00:04:22.460> that<00:04:22.850> if<00:04:23.090> i<00:04:23.330> if<00:04:23.780> i<00:04:23.900> can<00:04:24.050> accumulate

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
i think that if i if i can accumulate

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.920 
i think that if i if i can accumulate
some<00:04:24.680> chips<00:04:24.919> have

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
some chips have

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.249 
some chips have
good<00:04:26.080> shot<00:04:26.460> but<00:04:27.460> I<00:04:27.490> mean<00:04:27.639> right<00:04:27.759> now<00:04:27.820> I<00:04:27.940> have<00:04:28.259> 13

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:29.259 
good shot but I mean right now I have 13

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:31.110 
good shot but I mean right now I have 13
pounds<00:04:29.650> of<00:04:29.770> big<00:04:29.919> ones<00:04:30.160> so<00:04:30.490> I'm<00:04:30.729> just<00:04:30.910> I'm

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
pounds of big ones so I'm just I'm

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.310 
pounds of big ones so I'm just I'm
really<00:04:31.150> going<00:04:31.449> to<00:04:31.509> need<00:04:31.630> to<00:04:31.780> get<00:04:31.900> lucky<00:04:32.199> i'm

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
really going to need to get lucky i'm

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.450 
really going to need to get lucky i'm
going<00:04:32.440> to<00:04:32.500> need<00:04:32.560> to<00:04:32.680> get<00:04:32.800> my<00:04:32.919> money<00:04:33.100> and<00:04:33.250> good

going to need to get my money and good

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.120 
going to need to get my money and good
and<00:04:33.669> then<00:04:33.880> we'll<00:04:34.060> hope<00:04:34.300> to<00:04:34.330> hold<00:04:34.919> maybe<00:04:35.919> put

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
and then we'll hope to hold maybe put

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.110 
and then we'll hope to hold maybe put
some<00:04:36.160> chips<00:04:36.400> together<00:04:36.520> and<00:04:36.850> good<00:04:36.970> things

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
some chips together and good things

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.959 
some chips together and good things
happen

00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:42.969 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:47.279 

I<00:04:44.909> mean<00:04:45.909> I<00:04:45.999> think<00:04:46.179> it's<00:04:46.509> every<00:04:46.779> players<00:04:47.019> dream

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:47.289 
I mean I think it's every players dream

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:50.129 
I mean I think it's every players dream
when<00:04:47.589> I<00:04:47.619> was<00:04:47.860> when<00:04:48.249> I<00:04:48.309> was<00:04:48.399> 16<00:04:49.239> or<00:04:49.269> 17<00:04:49.389> I<00:04:49.929> watched

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
when I was when I was 16 or 17 I watched

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:51.929 
when I was when I was 16 or 17 I watched

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:54.909 
the coolest thing I was like that's the

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:56.339 
the coolest thing I was like that's the
coolest<00:04:55.089> thing<00:04:55.449> you<00:04:55.659> know<00:04:55.749> something<00:04:56.110> we<00:04:56.199> all

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:00.099 
to be there and just kind of none of us

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:03.539 
to be there and just kind of none of us

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
I feel super lucky to be in the

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.039 
I feel super lucky to be in the
spotlight<00:05:05.979> said<00:05:06.879> I<00:05:06.909> really<00:05:07.299> didn't<00:05:07.839> think<00:05:07.869> I

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:08.049 
spotlight said I really didn't think I

00:05:08.049 --> 00:05:10.589 
spotlight said I really didn't think I
had<00:05:08.199> I<00:05:08.519> mean<00:05:09.519> even<00:05:09.639> even<00:05:10.029> the<00:05:10.089> best<00:05:10.329> player<00:05:10.569> of

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:10.599 
had I mean even even the best player of

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:11.699 
had I mean even even the best player of
your<00:05:10.749> 10<00:05:10.929> times<00:05:11.110> better<00:05:11.259> than<00:05:11.379> the<00:05:11.529> rest<00:05:11.589> of

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:11.709 
your 10 times better than the rest of

00:05:11.709 --> 00:05:13.049 
your 10 times better than the rest of
the<00:05:11.799> field<00:05:11.979> it's<00:05:12.189> still<00:05:12.369> statistically<00:05:12.579> very

00:05:13.049 --> 00:05:13.059 
the field it's still statistically very

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:14.479 
the field it's still statistically very
unlikely<00:05:13.419> you<00:05:13.659> can<00:05:13.809> make<00:05:13.899> the<00:05:14.019> final<00:05:14.289> table

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:14.489 
unlikely you can make the final table

00:05:14.489 --> 00:05:17.249 
unlikely you can make the final table
and<00:05:15.489> so<00:05:16.269> I<00:05:16.299> just<00:05:16.599> I<00:05:16.749> really<00:05:16.839> want<00:05:17.079> to<00:05:17.139> take

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:17.259 
and so I just I really want to take

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:18.569
