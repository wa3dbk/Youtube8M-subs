this<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.070> over<00:00:53.340> everything<00:00:53.640> will<00:00:53.940> sort<00:00:54.120> of

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
this is over everything will sort of

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.420 
this is over everything will sort of
snap<00:00:54.989> back<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.440> normal<00:00:55.739> for<00:00:55.860> everybody<00:00:56.250> not

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430

process<00:01:43.140> they<00:01:44.140> had<00:01:44.320> not<00:01:44.500> been<00:01:44.680> mixed<00:01:45.010> yet<00:01:45.190> they

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
process they had not been mixed yet they

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.710 
process they had not been mixed yet they
were<00:01:45.910> close<00:01:46.180> enough<00:01:46.450> to<00:01:46.570> being<00:01:46.720> finished<00:01:47.140> that

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
were close enough to being finished that

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.240 
were close enough to being finished that
they<00:01:49.720> could<00:01:50.350> go<00:01:50.470> in<00:01:50.620> there<00:01:50.770> and<00:01:50.860> finish<00:01:51.040> it

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
they could go in there and finish it

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.600 
they could go in there and finish it
without<00:01:51.310> me<00:01:51.550> what<00:01:51.940> they<00:01:52.060> did<00:01:52.090> and<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:54.310> know<00:01:54.340> I

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
without me what they did and you know I

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:03.290 
without me what they did and you know I
asked<00:01:55.030> them<00:01:55.120> not<00:01:55.270> to<00:01:55.330> and<00:01:55.630> they<00:01:55.690> did<00:01:55.840> anyway

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.180

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
sounded like it was going to be

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.280 
sounded like it was going to be
retribution<00:02:09.580> on<00:02:09.970> your<00:02:10.119> part<00:02:10.360> for<00:02:10.720> them<00:02:10.990> doing

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
there's gonna be a lot of things to

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:30.259 
there's gonna be a lot of things to
discuss<00:02:23.650> on<00:02:24.010> many<00:02:24.250> levels

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.550 

you<00:02:31.269> see<00:02:31.420> people<00:02:31.750> over<00:02:31.930> the<00:02:32.019> fence<00:02:32.230> that<00:02:32.500> you

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
you see people over the fence that you

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.830 
you see people over the fence that you
you<00:02:33.040> know<00:02:33.160> work<00:02:33.340> with<00:02:33.370> every<00:02:33.760> day<00:02:33.940> and<00:02:33.970> it's

you know to some extent after it's over
I<00:02:39.070> do<00:02:39.370> think<00:02:40.060> it's<00:02:40.330> gonna<00:02:40.480> be<00:02:47.160> you<00:02:48.160> know

I do think it's gonna be you know
nothing<00:02:49.000> gets<00:02:49.150> done<00:02:49.300> but<00:02:49.510> it<00:02:49.660> has<00:02:50.410> to<00:02:50.680> kind<00:02:50.830> of

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
nothing gets done but it has to kind of

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.949 
nothing gets done but it has to kind of
return<00:02:51.760> to<00:02:52.030> normal<00:02:52.330> pretty<00:02:52.420> quickly<00:02:52.720> once

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
return to normal pretty quickly once

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.130 
return to normal pretty quickly once
it's<00:02:53.140> over<00:02:53.410> but<00:02:53.590> you<00:02:53.830> know<00:02:54.690> at<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:55.810> moment<00:02:56.110> I

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
it's over but you know at the moment I

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.520 
it's over but you know at the moment I
mean<00:02:56.290> you<00:02:56.380> have<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:58.540> studio<00:02:58.810> is<00:02:58.900> telling<00:02:59.170> the

writers one thing and wallstreet another
yeah<00:03:02.860> and<00:03:03.209> if<00:03:04.209> their<00:03:04.390> line<00:03:04.540> of<00:03:04.570> the<00:03:04.780> writers

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
yeah and if their line of the writers

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.420 
yeah and if their line of the writers
they're<00:03:05.260> assholes<00:03:05.620> and<00:03:05.830> if<00:03:05.920> a<00:03:05.980> line<00:03:06.130> of<00:03:06.280> Wall

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
they're assholes and if a line of Wall

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.949 
they're assholes and if a line of Wall
Street<00:03:06.670> they're<00:03:06.820> breaking<00:03:07.090> the<00:03:07.150> law<00:03:07.180> so<00:03:09.959> it's

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
Street they're breaking the law so it's

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.830 
Street they're breaking the law so it's
it's<00:03:11.350> it's<00:03:12.100> very<00:03:12.190> head<00:03:12.790> scratcher<00:03:13.150> today<00:03:13.540> I

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
it's it's very head scratcher today I

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.570 
it's it's very head scratcher today I
would<00:03:14.590> think<00:03:14.680> that<00:03:14.769> the<00:03:14.950> line<00:03:15.100> of<00:03:15.130> this<00:03:15.310> plays

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
would think that the line of this plays

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.040 
would think that the line of this plays
out<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:16.000> more<00:03:16.180> likely<00:03:16.510> we're<00:03:16.630> going<00:03:16.750> to<00:03:16.810> find

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
out the more likely we're going to find

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.110 
out the more likely we're going to find
out<00:03:17.230> which<00:03:17.440> one<00:03:17.620> of<00:03:17.650> us<00:03:17.799> are<00:03:18.010> lying<00:03:18.190> too<00:03:18.430> yeah

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
out which one of us are lying too yeah

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.720 
out which one of us are lying too yeah
well<00:03:19.330> I<00:03:19.360> think<00:03:19.420> I<00:03:19.600> mean<00:03:19.750> yeah<00:03:20.560> I<00:03:20.890> think<00:03:21.220> again

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
well I think I mean yeah I think again

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.120 
well I think I mean yeah I think again
logic<00:03:22.330> and<00:03:22.450> reason<00:03:22.780> tell<00:03:23.590> us<00:03:23.739> the<00:03:23.890> perhaps

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
logic and reason tell us the perhaps

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.520 
logic and reason tell us the perhaps
perhaps<00:03:24.670> the<00:03:25.120> writers<00:03:25.420> are<00:03:25.600> being<00:03:25.780> lied<00:03:25.959> to

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
perhaps the writers are being lied to

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.080 
perhaps the writers are being lied to
as<00:03:26.980> your<00:03:27.310> show<00:03:27.580> ever<00:03:27.760> made<00:03:27.970> a<00:03:28.000> profit<00:03:28.420> a<00:03:28.650> court

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
as your show ever made a profit a court

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.820 
as your show ever made a profit a court
I<00:03:31.090> heard<00:03:31.990> somewhere<00:03:32.290> that<00:03:32.350> they<00:03:32.500> said<00:03:32.709> The

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
I heard somewhere that they said The

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.770 
I heard somewhere that they said The
Simpsons<00:03:33.220> hadn't<00:03:33.970> made<00:03:34.090> a<00:03:34.150> profit<00:03:34.569> I<00:03:34.630> don't

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
Simpsons hadn't made a profit I don't

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.760 
Simpsons hadn't made a profit I don't
know<00:03:34.900> if<00:03:34.959> there's<00:03:35.350> any<00:03:35.500> truth<00:03:35.530> to<00:03:35.770> that<00:03:35.950> but

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
know if there's any truth to that but

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.990 
know if there's any truth to that but
then<00:03:38.770> if<00:03:39.040> that's<00:03:39.220> true<00:03:39.430> then<00:03:39.580> we<00:03:39.700> definitely

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
then if that's true then we definitely

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.150 
then if that's true then we definitely
have<00:03:40.330> not<00:03:40.480> made<00:03:40.660> a<00:03:40.690> profit<00:03:41.080> if<00:03:41.800> that's<00:03:42.069> the

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
have not made a profit if that's the

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.949 
have not made a profit if that's the
case<00:03:42.280> why<00:03:42.550> is<00:03:42.610> there<00:03:42.880> not<00:03:43.000> a<00:03:43.060> for<00:03:43.390> sale<00:03:43.569> sign<00:03:43.630> in

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
case why is there not a for sale sign in

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.320 
case why is there not a for sale sign in
front<00:03:44.319> of<00:03:44.380> the<00:03:44.440> Fox<00:03:44.650> lot<00:03:44.770> maybe<00:03:45.400> there<00:03:45.580> is<00:03:45.670> but

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
front of the Fox lot maybe there is but

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.020 
front of the Fox lot maybe there is but
there<00:03:47.110> may<00:03:47.200> be<00:03:47.230> before<00:03:47.590> this<00:03:47.709> is<00:03:47.860> all<00:03:47.950> over

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.420 

that<00:03:52.030> it<00:03:52.120> won't<00:03:52.330> be<00:03:52.599> that<00:03:52.930> much<00:03:53.620> longer<00:03:54.010> and<00:03:54.340> I

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
that it won't be that much longer and I

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.550 
that it won't be that much longer and I
think<00:03:54.610> a<00:03:54.640> lot<00:03:54.790> of<00:03:54.910> people<00:03:55.180> are<00:03:55.330> are<00:03:56.140> optimistic

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
think a lot of people are are optimistic

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.600
