 hello numerous artists the authors of this book responsible for the project 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.050
 not by pau gasol with the rest of the search engines only that they were aware of the 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.730
 other than to afford to live with me luis panelo hero of the boss series of the 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.150
 department of attention of the state of Samoa computer esteem stripped the 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.019
 best friend who turned out to be the end of points we complained like a prayer 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.310
 of course the corporation all that when I was still 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.380
 seven years old 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.600
 with the basic choices of the rich father means about isner for all 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.840
 those who gave him and others for a story with it have worked with the 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.960
 step of the minutes that I paid 10 cents an hour and clarified is that I did not 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.940
 they say nothing on the subject of the Chinese premier urged the singer three hours 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.450
 Saturdays I did not pay him 30 cents menezes he told him in the dark eshop 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.630
 because we presented the un and then I became very angry and went ahead with the 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.780
 college virxe I thought it was going to be a sign about money who we 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.699
 taught nothing is to say pieces for it we requested the work who better 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.560
 understanding of many this moment 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.549
 percent is more ambitious the homeland tells me that I have to ask for 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:13.860
 a moment and at that moment said young girls this designing the lesson 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.290
 more valuable ecclesiastical sectors like miss insulted per hour I do not 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:22.289
 violated minutes on this site then it caught me it was difficult to work for the 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:27.399
 eighth date thus remains of that number one of poor father parents and children 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:30.780
 who are very important because he was teaching in the national team 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.159
 number one this is that the rich do not work cook they are not the 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.009
 guilty of committing to teach at this time but that if you are rich 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.380
 he had to learn not to work for the first what he will have to learn to 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.429
 how to do that will not work for me 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:50.409
 stéphane in a little more detail the decision of the Basques if you 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.420
 questions to any field 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.110
 if you are going to say that there are three basic types of interest the first of them 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.529
 the income earned when I interviewed the trueblue school paracorto jason 

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:02.439
 isaacs 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:07.079
 basically because he could only choose lower income to people his age 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.900
 So the problem with this Monday is that they bring in more taxes. 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.450
 which is really difficult 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.700
 get rich through income earn with a potpourri with been advising 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.080
 not to touch for the money but with him we did not work for me when I was 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.529
 advising to work hard obtained its portfolio 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:28.549
 is the kiss that come from executions in roles such as 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:33.059
 safe donoso shares and mutual funds things like these other low 

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:37.429
 very strong because passive income sells its liabilities is an income that 

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:42.360
 usually comes from ten countries of decline that did have traffic drops 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.520
 I had to learn to skate not because of the income earned, not because of the money, 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.379
 work hard for portfolio income in those liabilities 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:56.340
 so the munificent community to be better not happy with this happening 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.329
 turn on your livestock but yes it's really hard work to cook the channel through 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:07.859
 of them percent and their portfolios colossus or in liabilities 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:12.590
 with two goals of the young man complutense this percentage in the shot 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.690
 the child entered livestock into passive portfolios if you really 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.780
 wants to be rich what a resource to do is how to convert income 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.250
 earned portfolio income or even the passive one of the horoscopes which is 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.519
 that this board game system group of cash this game was fiscal 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.870
 guided to train people to what my rich dad taught me that was how 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.139
 to turn into an ordered English the entrance of jorge fuembuena to be positive the 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:41.270
 why I could breathe 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.810
 at a very early age it was not because I had a highly paid income yes 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.170
 not first because I had a lot of that portfolio a lot from his team 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.950
 in real estate so I understand a few weeks of the election the 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.979
 second book with which the source also came 

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:02.639
 I know I am tired among the applicants of his conception is to believe 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:06.739
 in the life of the xisco father for financial freedom in that sense the 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:07.529
 'number two' 

00:04:07.529 --> 00:04:10.989
 what follows after the autonomic department advanced that the details 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.359
 so that those who do not read the book this is the big day of them with 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:19.729
 little cash background basically because four types of people who 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:25.240
 make and successful of the world the illusion type employees the distinction has little 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.919
 You can use a small but if before 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.129
 Entrepreneurs or entrepreneurs the list of investments 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:36.729
 stable growth said it was gh is that studying please go to school 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:39.229
 in tune with the notes of the working group 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:43.509
 the ocher was advising worker little coloring the employees 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:47.840
 cooper in the area although with less possible fugitives and before my father 

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:52.330
 rich less coveted to work hard for that is necessary with 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.189
 investors argued that they are only the reasons as headquarters for this work as 

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:59.589
 before and that these rites clean up much less you have to learn the 

00:04:59.589 --> 00:05:03.550
 skills to think on this side of the border what their associates 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.090
 on his website is pessimistic plug 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.770
 is to teach people not fools as for all just the consumption that has 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:16.070
 been on our side a lotus usf1 right thigh of all suede on the side 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.249
 right of the coloring even though the one who teaches you 

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:23.379
 it's like making the January portfolio income that liabilities 

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:24.719
 so the action 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:28.210
 number one of these guys do not work for money what they will already see 

00:05:28.209 --> 00:05:32.509
 pointed the business owner that we build schools for example those of 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:37.559
 real estate or underemployed shares we are optimistic Patiño expressed his 

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:38.990
 portfolio and liabilities 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.060
 and that's what I mean when I say that the rich do not work
