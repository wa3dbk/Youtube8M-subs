that<00:00:08.189> I<00:00:08.340> sell<00:00:08.719> because<00:00:09.719> basically<00:00:10.170> I've<00:00:10.650> found

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
that I sell because basically I've found

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.390 
that I sell because basically I've found
that<00:00:11.309> it's<00:00:11.460> pretty<00:00:11.700> good<00:00:11.880> I<00:00:12.530> often<00:00:13.530> get<00:00:13.769> asked

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
that it's pretty good I often get asked

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.580 
that it's pretty good I often get asked
if<00:00:14.490> I<00:00:14.700> will<00:00:14.940> add<00:00:15.330> something<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.500> my<00:00:17.180> lineup<00:00:18.590> by

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
if I will add something to my lineup by

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.590 
if I will add something to my lineup by
a<00:00:19.670> manufacturer<00:00:20.670> in<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.750> will<00:00:22.580> usually

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600 
a manufacturer in and I will usually

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.259 
a manufacturer in and I will usually
test<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.230> then<00:00:25.470> turn<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.070> down<00:00:26.220> but<00:00:27.060> this

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
test it and then turn it down but this

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.589 
test it and then turn it down but this
one<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:27.900> tested<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.160> was<00:00:29.189> just<00:00:29.550> fantastic<00:00:29.730> I

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
one I tested and it was just fantastic I

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.200 
one I tested and it was just fantastic I
thought<00:00:31.019> for<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.439> portable<00:00:31.820> ionizing<00:00:32.820> pitcher

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
thought for a portable ionizing pitcher

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.830 
thought for a portable ionizing pitcher
it's<00:00:33.420> really<00:00:34.200> good<00:00:34.440> so<00:00:35.430> I'm<00:00:35.940> adding<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.809> my

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
it's really good so I'm adding it to my

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.680 
it's really good so I'm adding it to my
lineup<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.680> I'm<00:00:37.770> just<00:00:37.980> going<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.190> show<00:00:38.489> you

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
lineup and I'm just going to show you

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.250 
lineup and I'm just going to show you
what<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.899> tests<00:00:40.410> like<00:00:40.590> now<00:00:41.450> my<00:00:42.450> water<00:00:42.780> coming

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
what it tests like now my water coming

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.930 
what it tests like now my water coming
into<00:00:43.379> Saint<00:00:43.680> Louis<00:00:43.890> I'm<00:00:44.250> just<00:00:44.489> going<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.670> show

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
into Saint Louis I'm just going to show

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.729 
into Saint Louis I'm just going to show
you<00:00:45.000> what<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:45.989> tests<00:00:46.980> for<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.210> pH<00:00:48.539> at<00:00:48.960> least

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
you what that tests for the pH at least

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.540 
you what that tests for the pH at least
and<00:00:50.570> it's<00:00:51.570> it's<00:00:52.140> basically<00:00:52.440> coming<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.309> st.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
and it's it's basically coming in to st.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.970 
and it's it's basically coming in to st.
Louis<00:00:53.820> at<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.030> nine<00:00:54.239> point<00:00:54.539> three<00:00:55.879> pH<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.980> now

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
Louis at a nine point three pH and now

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.180 
Louis at a nine point three pH and now
I'm<00:00:59.160> going<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.960> pour<00:01:00.960> from<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.410> well<00:01:01.920> bluey

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
I'm going to pour from the well bluey

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.929 
I'm going to pour from the well bluey
it's<00:01:02.579> it's<00:01:03.390> still<00:01:03.750> actually<00:01:04.700> filtering<00:01:05.700> down

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
it's it's still actually filtering down

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.270 
it's it's still actually filtering down
but<00:01:06.270> I'm<00:01:06.360> going<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.600> remove<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:07.590> top<00:01:08.520> bin<00:01:09.119> and

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
but I'm going to remove this top bin and

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:25.359 
but I'm going to remove this top bin and
just<00:01:11.280> pour<00:01:12.409> hold<00:01:13.409> on<00:01:14.960> set<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.110> here<00:01:16.140> forever

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:32.870 

alright<00:01:30.590> and<00:01:31.590> I'm<00:01:32.009> going<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.340> test<00:01:32.549> both<00:01:32.850> the

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
alright and I'm going to test both the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.050 
alright and I'm going to test both the
pH<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.869> ORP<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.710> show<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.009> what<00:01:35.850> those

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
pH and the ORP and show you what those

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.710 
pH and the ORP and show you what those
are<00:01:36.479> now<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.380> ORP<00:01:38.369> is<00:01:41.000> I've<00:01:42.000> tested<00:01:42.570> this

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
are now the ORP is I've tested this

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.670 
are now the ORP is I've tested this
before<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.890> was<00:01:44.310> like<00:01:44.850> about<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.149> negative

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
before and it was like about a negative

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.999 
before and it was like about a negative
for<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.970> 300<00:01:47.970> something<00:01:48.240> but<00:01:48.630> now<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:49.740> looks

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
for a 300 something but now this looks

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.550 
for a 300 something but now this looks
even<00:01:50.310> better<00:01:50.460> than<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.479> that's<00:01:52.350> just

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
even better than that so that's just

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.179 
even better than that so that's just
incredible<00:01:53.220> now<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.210> will<00:01:54.420> be<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.470> will<00:01:55.770> vary

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
incredible now it will be it will vary

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.359 
incredible now it will be it will vary
during<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.299> day<00:01:57.509> if<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:58.619> have<00:01:59.270> poured<00:02:00.270> a

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
during the day if you have poured a

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.179 
during the day if you have poured a
pitcher<00:02:02.369> full<00:02:02.640> let's<00:02:03.630> say<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:04.259> couple<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:04.950> hours

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
pitcher full let's say a couple of hours

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.510 
pitcher full let's say a couple of hours
ago<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:06.180> might<00:02:06.360> only<00:02:06.630> get<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:06.960> negative<00:02:07.200> 400<00:02:08.009> ORP

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
ago it might only get a negative 400 ORP

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.949 
ago it might only get a negative 400 ORP
but<00:02:09.119> if<00:02:09.209> it's<00:02:09.390> been<00:02:09.599> sitting<00:02:09.959> all<00:02:10.050> night<00:02:10.379> or<00:02:10.709> so

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
but if it's been sitting all night or so

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.319 
but if it's been sitting all night or so
like<00:02:11.140> that<00:02:11.349> it'll<00:02:11.920> get<00:02:12.189> up<00:02:12.340> a<00:02:12.519> pretty<00:02:13.060> high

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.329 
like that it'll get up a pretty high

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:18.000 
like that it'll get up a pretty high
negative<00:02:14.200> 500<00:02:14.650> ORP<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:16.540> pH<00:02:16.930> has<00:02:17.469> gone<00:02:17.739> up

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
negative 500 ORP and the pH has gone up

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.949 
negative 500 ORP and the pH has gone up
to<00:02:18.310> a<00:02:18.670> ten<00:02:19.060> point<00:02:19.680> six<00:02:20.680> now<00:02:21.489> this<00:02:22.450> is<00:02:22.659> not<00:02:22.930> a

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
to a ten point six now this is not a

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.380 
to a ten point six now this is not a
brand<00:02:23.290> new<00:02:23.590> filter<00:02:24.099> I've<00:02:24.370> been<00:02:24.730> testing<00:02:25.269> it

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
brand new filter I've been testing it

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.809 
brand new filter I've been testing it
for<00:02:25.750> about<00:02:26.109> six<00:02:26.469> weeks<00:02:26.560> and<00:02:27.540> it's<00:02:28.540> been<00:02:29.819> you

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
for about six weeks and it's been you

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.110 
for about six weeks and it's been you
it's<00:02:31.569> been<00:02:31.840> filtered<00:02:32.079> about<00:02:32.670> fifty<00:02:33.670> or<00:02:33.819> so

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
it's been filtered about fifty or so

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.099 
it's been filtered about fifty or so
times<00:02:35.049> so<00:02:36.010> and<00:02:36.549> I'm<00:02:36.700> continuing<00:02:37.480> to<00:02:37.510> test<00:02:37.900> it

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:38.109 
times so and I'm continuing to test it

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:40.860 
times so and I'm continuing to test it
because<00:02:38.500> that's<00:02:39.209> something<00:02:40.209> that<00:02:40.359> I<00:02:40.480> want<00:02:40.780> to

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
because that's something that I want to

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.750 
because that's something that I want to
make<00:02:40.989> sure<00:02:41.230> if<00:02:41.379> I'm<00:02:41.620> going<00:02:42.250> to<00:02:42.370> be<00:02:42.430> carrying

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
make sure if I'm going to be carrying

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.580 
make sure if I'm going to be carrying
this<00:02:42.909> product<00:02:43.480> that<00:02:43.599> I<00:02:43.659> know<00:02:43.750> all<00:02:44.169> about<00:02:44.379> it

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
this product that I know all about it

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.330 
this product that I know all about it
and<00:02:45.060> it<00:02:46.060> says<00:02:46.450> that<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:47.049> filter<00:02:47.829> will<00:02:48.040> last

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
and it says that the filter will last

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.479 
and it says that the filter will last
for<00:02:49.030> about<00:02:49.870> three<00:02:50.290> months<00:02:50.560> and<00:02:52.560> basically<00:02:53.560> so

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
for about three months and basically so

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.699 
for about three months and basically so
far<00:02:54.760> I'm<00:02:54.909> thinking<00:02:55.389> it's<00:02:55.569> going<00:02:56.290> at<00:02:56.469> least

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
far I'm thinking it's going at least

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.759 
far I'm thinking it's going at least
last<00:02:57.010> two<00:02:57.310> months<00:02:57.669> in<00:02:57.790> it<00:02:57.939> and<00:02:58.120> a<00:02:59.049> lot<00:02:59.409> of<00:02:59.439> times

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
last two months in it and a lot of times

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.860 
last two months in it and a lot of times
with<00:02:59.980> pH<00:03:00.340> pitchers<00:03:00.849> I<00:03:01.030> will<00:03:01.239> find<00:03:01.510> that<00:03:01.689> they

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
with pH pitchers I will find that they

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.589 
with pH pitchers I will find that they
don't<00:03:02.049> fact<00:03:02.590> last<00:03:03.250> as<00:03:03.609> long<00:03:03.849> as<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.209> company

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
don't fact last as long as the company

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.500 
don't fact last as long as the company
says<00:03:04.930> they<00:03:05.169> last<00:03:05.530> but<00:03:06.310> I<00:03:06.340> have<00:03:06.849> a<00:03:06.879> feeling<00:03:07.389> that

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
says they last but I have a feeling that

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.550 
says they last but I have a feeling that
this<00:03:07.719> very<00:03:08.019> well<00:03:08.290> might<00:03:08.769> I<00:03:10.079> personally<00:03:11.079> feel

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
this very well might I personally feel

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.640 
this very well might I personally feel
that<00:03:12.340> it's<00:03:12.849> a<00:03:13.030> good<00:03:13.299> idea<00:03:13.480> to<00:03:13.780> order<00:03:14.439> two

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
that it's a good idea to order two

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.009 
that it's a good idea to order two
pitchers<00:03:15.159> that's<00:03:15.459> that<00:03:15.940> way<00:03:16.150> if<00:03:16.329> you've<00:03:16.540> just

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
pitchers that's that way if you've just

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.860 
pitchers that's that way if you've just
poured<00:03:17.319> a<00:03:17.409> pitcher<00:03:17.769> full<00:03:17.979> and<00:03:18.750> you<00:03:19.750> have
