00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
them in our own garden we didn't have to

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:44.390 
them in our own garden we didn't have to
go<00:00:41.150> we<00:00:42.150> put<00:00:42.630> a<00:00:42.660> few<00:00:42.870> seedlings<00:00:43.380> around<00:00:43.710> but<00:00:43.950> the

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400 
go we put a few seedlings around but the

go we put a few seedlings around but the
climate<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:44.880> not<00:00:44.910> idea<00:00:45.360> who<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.630> yes<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:48.140> we've

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
climate is not idea who you yes so we've

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.890 
climate is not idea who you yes so we've
had<00:00:49.320> some<00:00:49.530> before<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.010> they've<00:00:50.130> died<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.900> don't

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:51.900 
had some before and they've died I don't

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.840 
had some before and they've died I don't
know<00:00:51.990> if<00:00:52.110> they'll<00:00:52.230> still<00:00:53.010> survive<00:00:53.340> or<00:00:53.550> not<00:00:53.580> but

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
know if they'll still survive or not but

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.120 
know if they'll still survive or not but
if<00:00:53.940> they<00:00:54.090> do<00:00:54.150> and<00:00:54.690> we<00:00:54.840> will<00:00:54.900> keep<00:00:55.080> trying<00:00:55.440> and

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.130 
if they do and we will keep trying and

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.800 
if they do and we will keep trying and
we've<00:00:56.310> got<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.460> creek<00:00:56.700> at<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.880> bottom<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.750> the

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:57.810 
we've got a creek at the bottom of the

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.400 
we've got a creek at the bottom of the
property<00:00:58.200> you<00:00:58.320> know<00:00:58.470> puts<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.190> tool<00:00:59.400> along<00:00:59.670> it

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
property you know puts a tool along it

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.260 
property you know puts a tool along it
something<00:01:01.410> like<00:01:01.650> especially<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.850> rain<00:01:03.090> over

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
something like especially the rain over

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.729 
something like especially the rain over
the<00:01:03.390> last<00:01:03.630> few<00:01:03.810> days<00:01:03.990> it<00:01:04.260> probably<00:01:04.559> there

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
the last few days it probably there

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.620 
the last few days it probably there
already<00:01:04.769> sprouting<00:01:05.460> if<00:01:06.060> they<00:01:06.179> managed<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.479> get

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
already sprouting if they managed to get

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.359 
already sprouting if they managed to get
their<00:01:06.780> tap<00:01:06.929> roots<00:01:07.140> down<00:01:07.380> far<00:01:07.679> enough<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:08.039> guess

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
their tap roots down far enough I guess

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.639 
their tap roots down far enough I guess
they're<00:01:08.579> in<00:01:08.700> with<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.909> chance<00:01:09.409> because<00:01:10.409> the

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
they're in with a chance because the

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:14.889 
they're in with a chance because the
water<00:01:10.829> level<00:01:10.950> will<00:01:11.340> be<00:01:11.460> there<00:01:11.670> at<00:01:11.880> some<00:01:12.119> point

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:14.899 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:17.209

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
14:01 fruit but I would go through

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.110 
14:01 fruit but I would go through
periods<00:03:19.900> where<00:03:23.549> there<00:03:24.549> was<00:03:24.670> no<00:03:24.790> strictly

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
periods where there was no strictly

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.910 
periods where there was no strictly
training<00:03:25.510> up<00:03:25.600> in<00:03:25.780> fruitarian<00:03:26.320> since<00:03:26.590> the
