a<00:04:38.160> project<00:04:38.610> like<00:04:39.030> this<00:04:39.090> for<00:04:39.540> instance<00:04:39.900> this

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
a project like this for instance this

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.190 
a project like this for instance this
this<00:04:40.560> piece<00:04:40.800> has<00:04:41.070> 30<00:04:41.760> pieces<00:04:42.060> it<00:04:42.390> took<00:04:42.570> a<00:04:42.690> 32

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
this piece has 30 pieces it took a 32

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.940 
this piece has 30 pieces it took a 32
pound<00:04:43.500> Rock<00:04:44.400> so<00:04:45.150> you<00:04:45.660> know<00:04:45.780> a<00:04:45.990> lot<00:04:46.229> of<00:04:46.290> times<00:04:46.590> if

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
pound Rock so you know a lot of times if

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.230 
pound Rock so you know a lot of times if
you<00:04:47.160> buy<00:04:48.169> smaller<00:04:49.169> pieces<00:04:49.530> to<00:04:49.740> make<00:04:50.340> make<00:04:51.030> this

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
you buy smaller pieces to make make this

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.690 
you buy smaller pieces to make make this
quantity<00:04:52.080> you're<00:04:52.950> gonna<00:04:53.100> have<00:04:53.340> a<00:04:53.370> hard<00:04:53.640> time

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
quantity you're gonna have a hard time
