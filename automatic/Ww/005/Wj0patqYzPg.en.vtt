00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.109
 Always as much as possible this I think that there is a certain degree can be seen Toko if you read the book in reference to a double-information 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.040
 I do not say the information obtained in 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:15.870
 Fede including my stories 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:20.020
 Let Itadako in conclusion, to be allowed to talk to say do not you say sprouting bought this three-legged 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:23.680
 By do you think Toka rain to buy everyone roughly 10,000 yen of shoes that I bought with or 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:28.150
 Maybe I'm I'm doing it crushed demonstrated in in the rain 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:31.980
 Then I talked to you earlier and write 10,000 yen shoes in a 3- leg rotation and useless in a year 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.980
 Are you using 600,000 in 20 years? 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:42.309
 It will be so it will be computational , so fashion is the same as fashion seminar 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:47.920
 Also full of business and mother after all the same as the guy that unit price is cheaper and you also quit string shoes 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:52.520
 Buy a high price, reduce the number of items, properly maintain and rotate 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:55.180
 I would like to provide information that let's keep wearing for a long time 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.180
 There was 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.930
 I was hurt by the rain that I can not put it on my 5th press 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.040
 Hi ends 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.690
 There are two yes 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.580
 The last is next month 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:12.140
 Shoe does not fit in the foot reason of this alternative experience it is I did not see even in a variety yourself 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.560
 First of all, it's five 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:21.390
 But it is not this problem is to be first Tsu that do not fit the size 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:26.460
 Not there is a width vertical size of which was said not, for example, another earlier match of this child 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:29.230
 If you're not a dad, you have shoes like this, for example . 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:34.330
 I also had the width of your feet 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:39.350
 I mean not fixed here too tied in to Let Then string the width does not rain 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:45.500
 So I'm ne Then rub is Taken to walk source 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:52.310
 Another thing hurt Where narrow as the width painter wide man to reverse had size rack to provisional 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:55.659
 Or unreasonable unreasonable foot person but it is with Taku' such do with Nde that digs a can of foot length 26 cm in 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:59.340
 But it might be the length of the arch, for example, 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:02.700
 If this person is equivalent to 26.5 cm 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:09.000
 The best shoes are 26.5 cm so say 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:10.170
 Then it made wooden of Tteyuu Las door guess Chi how it is there has been a best 17 pieces of wood in that shoes 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.750
 It is to say the 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:21.360
 Addition faction to not that good this this is here this adhesion form to provisional prototype Tatte back 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:24.080
 In this prototype in the form of the past and legs he wound 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.080
 Usually 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:31.670
 Well it depends on the book and shoes is is first important First 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:37.459
 Lose kind and design Kind and design 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:39.170
 It is the kind of person who wants you to be careful of everyone, and it doesn't matter how much the design is extreme . 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:44.250
 I'm American shoes but 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:50.520
 It's a little heavy but durable It 's hard to say why American shoes are hard to make 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:51.900
 80% of all men and women in the United States are obese 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.319
 Wing tip 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.319
 How is it 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.900
 It will not be a problem suit 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:03.160
 US gray Slacks suit that matches with the current Slacks suit 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.000

 If you decide on a good night, please enter after regular 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:16.780
