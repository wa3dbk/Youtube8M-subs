is<00:02:42.030> a<00:02:42.060> really<00:02:42.420> good<00:02:42.540> time<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.870> get<00:02:42.959> it<00:02:43.110> because

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
is a really good time to get it because

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.470 
is a really good time to get it because
they<00:02:43.560> can<00:02:43.739> spawn<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.069> lot<00:02:44.430> faster<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:44.940> just

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
they can spawn a lot faster and just

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.690 
they can spawn a lot faster and just
makes<00:02:45.630> it<00:02:45.750> way<00:02:46.049> easier<00:02:46.080> to<00:02:46.620> get<00:02:46.709> these<00:02:46.890> pets<00:02:47.160> so

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
makes it way easier to get these pets so

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.430 
makes it way easier to get these pets so
definitely<00:02:47.970> go<00:02:48.239> for<00:02:48.330> these<00:02:48.569> if<00:02:48.810> you<00:02:48.840> have<00:02:49.140> not

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
definitely go for these if you have not

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.800

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
boots but they are fairly rare so you

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.280 
boots but they are fairly rare so you
can't<00:03:08.819> expect<00:03:09.120> too<00:03:09.239> many<00:03:09.360> of<00:03:09.480> those<00:03:09.599> and<00:03:09.900> they

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
can't expect too many of those and they

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.289 
can't expect too many of those and they
also<00:03:10.470> have<00:03:10.769> a<00:03:10.799> very<00:03:11.220> high<00:03:11.489> price<00:03:11.819> at<00:03:12.120> the

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
also have a very high price at the

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:13.789 
also have a very high price at the
moment<00:03:12.450> which<00:03:12.690> I<00:03:12.840> was<00:03:12.959> surprised<00:03:13.319> by<00:03:13.470> because

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
moment which I was surprised by because

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.410 
moment which I was surprised by because
of<00:03:13.829> course<00:03:14.130> it's<00:03:14.310> pets<00:03:14.519> cape<00:03:14.760> I<00:03:14.940> thought<00:03:15.299> the

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
of course it's pets cape I thought the

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.789 
of course it's pets cape I thought the
dragon<00:03:15.750> rider<00:03:15.930> would<00:03:16.019> be<00:03:16.079> worth<00:03:16.319> nothing<00:03:16.769> but

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
dragon rider would be worth nothing but

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.500 
dragon rider would be worth nothing but
hey<00:03:17.099> apparently<00:03:17.850> it's<00:03:17.970> worth<00:03:18.150> a<00:03:18.269> little<00:03:18.389> bit

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
hey apparently it's worth a little bit

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
going to be the least profitable

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.170 
going to be the least profitable
although<00:04:16.530> it<00:04:16.829> might<00:04:17.039> be<00:04:17.220> chaos<00:04:17.609> elemental

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
although it might be chaos elemental

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.580 
although it might be chaos elemental
those<00:04:18.299> are<00:04:18.450> probably<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:18.870> worst<00:04:19.139> two<00:04:19.349> bosses

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
those are probably the worst two bosses

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.800 
those are probably the worst two bosses
that<00:04:20.250> will<00:04:20.459> be<00:04:20.579> doing<00:04:20.940> for<00:04:21.120> pets<00:04:21.359> on<00:04:21.570> this

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:23.849 
entire list we still got the Rex pet

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:25.490 
entire list we still got the Rex pet
from<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.090> last<00:04:24.300> episode<00:04:24.510> there<00:04:24.960> as<00:04:25.110> well<00:04:25.320> and

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
from the last episode there as well and

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.290 
from the last episode there as well and
the<00:04:25.590> reason<00:04:25.830> why

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
the reason why

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.939 
the reason why
is<00:04:26.360> no<00:04:26.539> profit<00:04:26.750> of<00:04:27.050> expert<00:04:27.409> is<00:04:27.530> because<00:04:27.830> I'm

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:27.949 
is no profit of expert is because I'm

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:29.860 
is no profit of expert is because I'm
waiting<00:04:28.250> to<00:04:28.340> sell<00:04:28.520> my<00:04:28.639> decays<00:04:29.000> loot<00:04:29.240> until<00:04:29.780> I

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
waiting to sell my decays loot until I

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.960 
waiting to sell my decays loot until I
get<00:04:30.020> all<00:04:30.229> three<00:04:30.590> pets<00:04:30.919> because<00:04:31.190> it's<00:04:31.669> very

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
get all three pets because it's very

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.430 
get all three pets because it's very
hard<00:04:32.240> to<00:04:32.270> keep<00:04:32.419> track<00:04:32.479> of<00:04:32.690> what<00:04:32.990> you<00:04:33.110> just<00:04:33.259> got

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
hard to keep track of what you just got

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.800 
hard to keep track of what you just got
from<00:04:33.770> one<00:04:34.069> dying<00:04:34.280> off<00:04:34.460> king<00:04:34.669> without<00:04:34.819> mixing

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
from one dying off king without mixing

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:36.909 
from one dying off king without mixing
