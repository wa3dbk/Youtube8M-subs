00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
green arrow / Hawkeye now I know this is

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.849 
green arrow / Hawkeye now I know this is
kind<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.480> cheating<00:00:57.780> since<00:00:57.960> it's<00:00:58.230> supposed<00:00:58.739> to

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
kind of cheating since it's supposed to

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.310 
kind of cheating since it's supposed to
be<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.219> top<00:00:59.460> five<00:00:59.850> but<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.809> reason<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:01.050> put<00:01:01.230> them

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
be a top five but the reason I put them

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.360 
be a top five but the reason I put them
there<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.559> they're<00:01:01.739> essentially<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.219> same

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
there is they're essentially the same

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.979 
there is they're essentially the same
character<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.030> didn't<00:01:03.600> feel<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.809> necessary

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
character so I didn't feel it necessary

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.200 
character so I didn't feel it necessary
to<00:01:04.409> have<00:01:04.530> one<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.860> them<00:01:04.979> take<00:01:05.369> up<00:01:05.519> another<00:01:05.640> slot

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
to have one of them take up another slot

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.910 
to have one of them take up another slot
since<00:01:07.020> they're<00:01:07.170> essentially<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.830> same

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
since they're essentially the same

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.859 
since they're essentially the same
character<00:01:08.310> but<00:01:08.700> yeah<00:01:08.880> Green<00:01:09.570> Arrow<00:01:09.780> and
