exact<00:01:02.129> same<00:01:02.340> dice<00:01:02.609> now<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.239> have<00:01:03.629> different

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
exact same dice now you have different

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.380 
exact same dice now you have different
dice<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.979> worth<00:01:05.159> getting<00:01:05.369> all<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.820> them<00:01:05.970> do

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
dice is it worth getting all of them do

they fit in the box

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:39.110 
they fit in the box
let's<00:01:07.950> look

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.120 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.490 

each<00:01:40.120> of<00:01:40.300> these<00:01:40.420> expansions<00:01:40.990> as<00:01:41.230> I<00:01:41.260> said

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
each of these expansions as I said

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.590 
each of these expansions as I said
contains<00:01:41.890> 14<00:01:42.460> so<00:01:42.760> you<00:01:42.820> have<00:01:43.000> to<00:01:43.120> pull<00:01:43.300> the<00:01:43.420> four

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
contains 14 so you have to pull the four

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.630 
contains 14 so you have to pull the four
teams<00:01:43.840> out<00:01:44.050> of<00:01:44.080> the<00:01:44.200> expansion<00:01:44.770> and<00:01:44.950> then

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
teams out of the expansion and then

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.940 
teams out of the expansion and then
sticker<00:01:46.360> them<00:01:46.630> up<00:01:46.900> there's<00:01:47.230> a<00:01:47.290> little<00:01:47.680> sheet

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950

sticker them up there's a little sheet
in<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:48.760> each<00:01:49.330> expansion<00:01:49.900> that<00:01:50.170> shows<00:01:50.470> you<00:01:50.680> how

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580

there's<00:02:28.959> a<00:02:29.020> symbol<00:02:29.560> and<00:02:29.770> that<00:02:29.800> shows<00:02:30.550> what

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
there's a symbol and that shows what

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.570 
there's a symbol and that shows what
team<00:02:31.540> it<00:02:31.720> is<00:02:31.750> so<00:02:32.320> one<00:02:32.590> side<00:02:32.860> of<00:02:33.040> each<00:02:33.160> one<00:02:33.430> has

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
team it is so one side of each one has

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.830 
team it is so one side of each one has
symbols<00:02:33.880> let's<00:02:34.030> take<00:02:34.150> a<00:02:34.180> look<00:02:34.390> at<00:02:34.510> these<00:02:34.660> two

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
symbols let's take a look at these two

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.699 
symbols let's take a look at these two
teams<00:02:35.050> these<00:02:35.260> are<00:02:35.380> from<00:02:35.500> two<00:02:35.680> different

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
teams these are from two different

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.090 
teams these are from two different
expansions<00:02:36.700> we<00:02:37.060> have<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.300> Marauders<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:38.100> the

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
expansions we have the Marauders and the

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.430 
expansions we have the Marauders and the
Manchester<00:02:39.850> Marauders<00:02:40.720> and<00:02:40.930> a<00:02:40.989> Louisville

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
Manchester Marauders and a Louisville

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.540 
Manchester Marauders and a Louisville
locust

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
locust

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.759 
locust
so<00:02:42.730> let's<00:02:42.880> take<00:02:43.000> a<00:02:43.030> look<00:02:43.120> at<00:02:43.239> that<00:02:43.680> here's<00:02:44.680> a

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
so let's take a look at that here's a

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.620 
so let's take a look at that here's a
dice<00:02:45.010> for<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.370> two<00:02:45.519> teams<00:02:45.820> the<00:02:46.090> Marauders<00:02:46.600> and

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
dice for the two teams the Marauders and

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.780 
dice for the two teams the Marauders and
the<00:02:46.870> locust<00:02:47.200> and<00:02:47.410> I<00:02:47.560> have<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.130> dice<00:02:48.340> from<00:02:48.640> the

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
the locust and I have the dice from the

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.970 
the locust and I have the dice from the
original<00:02:49.239> game<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.630> generic<00:02:50.110> dice<00:02:50.350> if<00:02:50.530> you<00:02:50.709> on

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
original game the generic dice if you on

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.390 
original game the generic dice if you on
top<00:02:51.220> so<00:02:52.060> as<00:02:52.150> you<00:02:52.300> can<00:02:52.420> see<00:02:52.660> here<00:02:53.220> let's<00:02:54.220> look

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
top so as you can see here let's look

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.520 
top so as you can see here let's look
each<00:02:54.850> one<00:02:55.209> has<00:02:55.390> a<00:02:55.420> very<00:02:55.690> different<00:02:55.959> defensive

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
each one has a very different defensive

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.009 
each one has a very different defensive
die<00:02:56.709> the<00:02:57.220> regular<00:02:57.519> defensive<00:02:57.910> die<00:02:58.000> has<00:02:58.209> a<00:02:58.239> 0<00:02:58.720> a

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
negative 4 and negative 5 the Marauders

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.259 
negative 4 and negative 5 the Marauders
have<00:03:03.400> a<00:03:03.489> 0<00:03:03.850> 0<00:03:04.600> negative<00:03:05.200> 2<00:03:05.410> to<00:03:06.160> 1<00:03:06.790> and<00:03:07.060> negative

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
have a 0 0 negative 2 to 1 and negative

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.810 
have a 0 0 negative 2 to 1 and negative

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.000 
1 not nearly as good of a defensive die
as<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.180> generic<00:03:10.510> one<00:03:10.780> and<00:03:11.019> the<00:03:11.560> locusts<00:03:11.860> have

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
as the generic one and the locusts have

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.850 
as the generic one and the locusts have
a<00:03:12.040> zero<00:03:12.400> a<00:03:12.489> 5<00:03:12.940> a<00:03:13.269> negative<00:03:13.690> 5<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:14.170> negative<00:03:14.200> 6

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
a zero a 5 a negative 5 and negative 6

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.229 
a zero a 5 a negative 5 and negative 6
and<00:03:15.130> an<00:03:15.640> 8<00:03:15.670> and<00:03:16.360> a<00:03:16.780> negative<00:03:17.200> 2<00:03:17.410> it's<00:03:18.239> very

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
and an 8 and a negative 2 it's very

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.630 
and an 8 and a negative 2 it's very
volatile<00:03:19.780> compared<00:03:20.290> to<00:03:20.440> the<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:21.160> original

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
volatile compared to the the original

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.060 
volatile compared to the the original
die<00:03:21.880> I<00:03:22.150> mean<00:03:22.600> you<00:03:22.720> could<00:03:22.900> do<00:03:23.019> better<00:03:23.470> stoppage

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
die I mean you could do better stoppage

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.100 
die I mean you could do better stoppage
but<00:03:24.250> at<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.430> same<00:03:24.610> time<00:03:24.850> it<00:03:25.000> could<00:03:25.090> also<00:03:25.209> your

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
but at the same time it could also your

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.650 
but at the same time it could also your
defense<00:03:26.650> could<00:03:27.010> have<00:03:27.190> a<00:03:27.220> hole<00:03:27.519> in<00:03:27.670> it<00:03:27.820> what

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
defense could have a hole in it what

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.180 
defense could have a hole in it what
makes<00:03:28.840> these<00:03:29.049> teams<00:03:29.350> different<00:03:29.650> is<00:03:29.980> the

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
makes these teams different is the

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.350 
makes these teams different is the
different<00:03:30.519> dice<00:03:30.640> let's<00:03:30.850> look<00:03:31.000> at<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.180> run

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
different dice let's look at the run

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.020 
different dice let's look at the run
dice<00:03:31.630> here<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.560> original<00:03:32.799> one<00:03:33.250> you<00:03:33.489> can<00:03:33.910> see

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
dice here the original one you can see

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.090 
dice here the original one you can see
the<00:03:34.120> run<00:03:34.269> dice<00:03:34.450> this<00:03:34.900> one<00:03:35.140> went<00:03:35.320> from<00:03:35.470> 0<00:03:35.769> to<00:03:35.890> 5

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
the run dice this one went from 0 to 5

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.460 
the run dice this one went from 0 to 5
this<00:03:36.489> one<00:03:36.700> went<00:03:36.880> from<00:03:37.120> 1<00:03:37.360> to<00:03:37.540> 7<00:03:37.750> this<00:03:38.080> one<00:03:38.260> went

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
this one went from 1 to 7 this one went

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.729 
this one went from 1 to 7 this one went
from<00:03:38.709> 3<00:03:39.400> to<00:03:39.640> 8<00:03:39.780> then<00:03:40.780> this<00:03:40.959> team<00:03:41.260> here<00:03:41.530> goes

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
from 3 to 8 then this team here goes

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.000 
from 3 to 8 then this team here goes
from<00:03:42.190> 2<00:03:42.610> to<00:03:42.820> 8<00:03:42.850> the<00:03:43.390> first<00:03:43.720> one<00:03:43.930> this<00:03:44.440> goes<00:03:44.739> from

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
from 2 to 8 the first one this goes from

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.550 
from 2 to 8 the first one this goes from
4<00:03:45.400> you<00:03:45.849> can<00:03:46.000> roll<00:03:46.209> a<00:03:46.240> 12<00:03:46.540> on<00:03:46.959> this<00:03:47.140> white<00:03:47.349> one

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
4 you can roll a 12 on this white one

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
4 you can roll a 12 on this white one
and<00:03:47.800> this<00:03:47.980> one<00:03:48.190> also<00:03:48.340> goes<00:03:48.640> up<00:03:48.819> to<00:03:48.970> 10

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
and this one also goes up to 10

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.700 
and this one also goes up to 10
and<00:03:49.670> so<00:03:50.090> the<00:03:50.270> running<00:03:50.600> dice<00:03:51.020> here<00:03:51.410> for<00:03:51.620> the

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:51.710 
and so the running dice here for the

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.330 
and so the running dice here for the
Marauders<00:03:52.250> is<00:03:52.520> quite<00:03:52.910> I<00:03:53.180> mean<00:03:53.360> really<00:03:54.170> good<00:03:54.410> on

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
Marauders is quite I mean really good on

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.470 
Marauders is quite I mean really good on
the<00:03:55.580> other<00:03:55.730> hand<00:03:56.000> if<00:03:56.120> you<00:03:56.180> look<00:03:56.300> at<00:03:56.390> the

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
the other hand if you look at the

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.150 
the other hand if you look at the
locusts<00:03:56.840> they're<00:03:57.140> running<00:03:57.440> there's<00:03:57.830> actually

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
locusts they're running there's actually

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.670 
locusts they're running there's actually
a<00:03:58.190> negative<00:03:58.340> 3<00:03:59.030> negative<00:03:59.300> 1<00:03:59.960> on<00:04:00.170> the<00:04:00.290> red<00:04:00.440> dye

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
a negative 3 negative 1 on the red dye

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.920 
a negative 3 negative 1 on the red dye
it<00:04:01.130> can<00:04:01.580> do<00:04:01.850> well<00:04:02.120> can<00:04:02.360> go<00:04:02.450> all<00:04:02.540> the<00:04:02.570> way<00:04:02.660> up<00:04:02.780> to

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
it can do well can go all the way up to

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.590 
it can do well can go all the way up to
9<00:04:03.140> but<00:04:03.410> again<00:04:04.280> they're<00:04:04.880> running<00:04:05.240> dice<00:04:05.390> are

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
9 but again they're running dice are

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.650 
9 but again they're running dice are
more<00:04:05.750> volatile<00:04:06.230> baking<00:04:07.100> up<00:04:07.250> to<00:04:07.400> 10<00:04:07.670> and<00:04:07.970> 12<00:04:08.360> and

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
more volatile baking up to 10 and 12 and

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.860 
more volatile baking up to 10 and 12 and
14<00:04:09.200> with<00:04:09.500> this<00:04:09.650> dye<00:04:09.830> but<00:04:10.390> so<00:04:11.390> then<00:04:11.540> we<00:04:11.600> look<00:04:11.750> at

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
14 with this dye but so then we look at

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.840 
14 with this dye but so then we look at
the<00:04:11.960> passing<00:04:12.470> dice<00:04:12.680> for<00:04:13.310> each<00:04:13.400> of<00:04:13.550> them<00:04:13.670> and

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
the passing dice for each of them and

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.539 
the passing dice for each of them and
you<00:04:13.910> can<00:04:14.030> see<00:04:14.210> the<00:04:14.690> original<00:04:15.110> one<00:04:15.260> it's<00:04:15.830> this

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
you can see the original one it's this

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.780 
you can see the original one it's this
one<00:04:16.730> starts<00:04:17.030> at<00:04:17.120> 10<00:04:17.450> and<00:04:17.690> goes<00:04:17.870> to<00:04:18.109> 16<00:04:18.980> the<00:04:19.609> blue

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
one starts at 10 and goes to 16 the blue

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.510 
one starts at 10 and goes to 16 the blue
one<00:04:20.030> goes<00:04:20.269> all<00:04:20.840> the<00:04:20.900> way<00:04:21.109> up<00:04:21.350> to<00:04:21.530> 14<00:04:22.070> the<00:04:22.340> other

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
one goes all the way up to 14 the other

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.360 
one goes all the way up to 14 the other
one<00:04:22.640> starts<00:04:22.940> at<00:04:23.060> 5<00:04:23.300> and<00:04:23.690> goes<00:04:23.810> up<00:04:23.960> to<00:04:24.110> 10<00:04:24.410> then

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
one starts at 5 and goes up to 10 then

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.970 
one starts at 5 and goes up to 10 then
here<00:04:25.850> the<00:04:26.300> green<00:04:26.540> one<00:04:26.750> this<00:04:27.140> one<00:04:27.380> goes<00:04:27.590> from<00:04:27.710> 9

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:27.980 
here the green one this one goes from 9

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.370 
here the green one this one goes from 9
to<00:04:28.370> 18<00:04:28.610> is<00:04:29.060> a<00:04:29.090> little<00:04:29.330> bit<00:04:29.450> better<00:04:29.600> and<00:04:29.900> this

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
to 18 is a little bit better and this

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.800 
to 18 is a little bit better and this
one<00:04:30.560> here<00:04:31.100> goes<00:04:31.670> up<00:04:31.700> to<00:04:31.880> 14<00:04:32.330> it's<00:04:32.510> pretty<00:04:32.690> much

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
one here goes up to 14 it's pretty much

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.170 
one here goes up to 14 it's pretty much
the<00:04:33.050> same<00:04:33.290> as<00:04:33.560> the<00:04:33.740> original<00:04:33.830> dye<00:04:34.400> and<00:04:34.700> then

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
the same as the original dye and then

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.900 
the same as the original dye and then
this<00:04:35.360> one<00:04:35.570> here<00:04:35.780> starts<00:04:36.440> at<00:04:36.590> 3<00:04:36.950> and<00:04:37.250> goes<00:04:37.670> up<00:04:37.820> to

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
this one here starts at 3 and goes up to

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.000 
this one here starts at 3 and goes up to
14<00:04:38.300> so<00:04:38.510> it's<00:04:38.630> a<00:04:38.660> little<00:04:38.870> bit<00:04:38.990> better<00:04:39.440> running

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
14 so it's a little bit better running

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.590 
14 so it's a little bit better running
than<00:04:40.430> the<00:04:40.610> original<00:04:41.090> team<00:04:41.270> if<00:04:41.390> I<00:04:41.480> was

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
than the original team if I was

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.990 
than the original team if I was
comparing<00:04:42.080> the<00:04:42.680> Marauders<00:04:43.280> to<00:04:43.460> the<00:04:43.580> original

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
comparing the Marauders to the original

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.450 
comparing the Marauders to the original
team<00:04:44.240> better<00:04:44.810> running<00:04:45.290> and<00:04:45.440> they<00:04:45.920> certainly

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
team better running and they certainly

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.010 
team better running and they certainly
have<00:04:46.670> better<00:04:46.880> passing<00:04:47.150> the<00:04:47.420> original<00:04:47.840> team

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
have better passing the original team

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.590 
have better passing the original team
but<00:04:48.650> their<00:04:48.860> defense<00:04:49.340> is<00:04:49.550> not<00:04:49.760> nearly<00:04:50.150> as<00:04:50.450> good

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
but their defense is not nearly as good

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.480 
but their defense is not nearly as good
so<00:04:51.410> if<00:04:51.500> I<00:04:51.590> was<00:04:51.710> playing<00:04:51.740> them<00:04:52.130> against<00:04:52.340> the

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
so if I was playing them against the

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:53.680 
so if I was playing them against the
original<00:04:52.850> team<00:04:53.000> the<00:04:53.120> original<00:04:53.420> team<00:04:53.540> would

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
original team the original team would

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.290 
original team the original team would
have<00:04:53.840> better<00:04:54.020> defense<00:04:54.610> here<00:04:55.610> we<00:04:55.910> can<00:04:56.090> see<00:04:56.270> that

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
have better defense here we can see that

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.960 
have better defense here we can see that
this<00:04:56.600> team<00:04:56.900> doesn't<00:04:57.860> have<00:04:58.130> as<00:04:58.280> good<00:04:58.490> of

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
this team doesn't have as good of

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.600 
this team doesn't have as good of
running<00:04:59.419> but<00:04:59.810> their<00:04:59.960> passing<00:05:00.530> is<00:05:00.680> phenomenal

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
running but their passing is phenomenal

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.310 
running but their passing is phenomenal
as<00:05:01.820> you<00:05:02.180> can<00:05:02.300> see<00:05:02.480> it<00:05:02.540> goes<00:05:02.690> all<00:05:02.900> the<00:05:02.930> way<00:05:03.020> up<00:05:03.169> to

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
as you can see it goes all the way up to

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.250 
as you can see it goes all the way up to
20<00:05:03.830> on<00:05:04.010> the<00:05:04.430> green<00:05:04.669> dye<00:05:04.910> and<00:05:05.210> on<00:05:05.780> the<00:05:05.900> blue<00:05:06.080> dye

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
20 on the green dye and on the blue dye

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.560 
20 on the green dye and on the blue dye
goes<00:05:06.530> up<00:05:06.680> to<00:05:06.770> 18<00:05:06.950> and<00:05:07.460> then<00:05:07.550> the<00:05:07.640> yellow<00:05:07.790> dye<00:05:08.030> it

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
goes up to 18 and then the yellow dye it

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.380 
goes up to 18 and then the yellow dye it
also<00:05:08.750> goes<00:05:09.020> up<00:05:09.050> to<00:05:09.260> 18<00:05:09.410> so<00:05:10.160> their<00:05:10.700> strong<00:05:11.090> point

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
also goes up to 18 so their strong point

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.650 
also goes up to 18 so their strong point
is<00:05:11.590> passing<00:05:12.590> now<00:05:13.400> I<00:05:13.430> can<00:05:13.760> know<00:05:13.940> this<00:05:14.120> simply<00:05:14.510> by

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
is passing now I can know this simply by

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.720 
is passing now I can know this simply by
looking<00:05:14.840> at<00:05:15.080> the<00:05:15.140> back<00:05:15.320> of<00:05:15.500> the<00:05:15.560> boxes<00:05:15.980> at<00:05:16.580> the

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:16.730 
looking at the back of the boxes at the

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.480 
looking at the back of the boxes at the
back<00:05:16.880> of<00:05:16.910> each<00:05:17.180> box<00:05:17.480> I<00:05:17.840> can<00:05:18.290> look<00:05:18.680> and<00:05:18.890> see<00:05:19.130> the

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
back of each box I can look and see the

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.220 
back of each box I can look and see the
stats<00:05:19.850> of<00:05:20.060> each<00:05:20.180> of<00:05:20.360> the<00:05:20.450> teams<00:05:20.690> here<00:05:20.990> you<00:05:21.080> can

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.230 
stats of each of the teams here you can

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.290 
stats of each of the teams here you can
see<00:05:21.410> the<00:05:21.919> locusts<00:05:22.340> have<00:05:22.370> great<00:05:23.770> running<00:05:24.770> and

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
see the locusts have great running and

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.120 
see the locusts have great running and
very<00:05:26.300> I'm<00:05:26.750> sorry<00:05:27.020> decent<00:05:27.440> running<00:05:27.680> and<00:05:27.860> very

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
very I'm sorry decent running and very

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.510 
very I'm sorry decent running and very
good<00:05:28.340> passing<00:05:28.790> but<00:05:29.419> their<00:05:29.770> defense<00:05:30.770> is<00:05:31.220> fairly

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
good passing but their defense is fairly

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.520 
good passing but their defense is fairly
low<00:05:31.820> well<00:05:32.300> if<00:05:32.390> I<00:05:32.479> play<00:05:32.690> the<00:05:32.840> Spartans<00:05:33.380> they

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
low well if I play the Spartans they

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.620 
low well if I play the Spartans they
have<00:05:33.710> great<00:05:34.070> defense<00:05:34.310> and<00:05:34.790> so<00:05:34.970> the<00:05:35.120> back<00:05:35.330> of

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
have great defense and so the back of

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.670 
have great defense and so the back of
each<00:05:36.229> box<00:05:36.650> shows<00:05:37.430> you<00:05:37.760> the<00:05:38.419> stats<00:05:38.900> of<00:05:39.200> the<00:05:39.380> four

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
each box shows you the stats of the four

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.219 
each box shows you the stats of the four
teams<00:05:39.950> inside<00:05:40.550> and<00:05:40.910> so<00:05:41.450> you<00:05:41.510> if<00:05:41.780> you<00:05:42.020> know<00:05:42.140> if

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:42.229 
teams inside and so you if you know if

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:43.330 
teams inside and so you if you know if
you<00:05:42.350> want<00:05:42.500> to<00:05:42.530> play<00:05:42.680> a<00:05:42.710> super<00:05:43.100> strong

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
you want to play a super strong

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.580 
you want to play a super strong
defensive<00:05:44.000> team<00:05:44.240> or<00:05:44.960> if<00:05:45.080> you<00:05:45.169> want<00:05:45.350> to<00:05:45.410> play

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
defensive team or if you want to play

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.800 
defensive team or if you want to play
kind<00:05:46.160> of<00:05:46.310> an<00:05:46.400> evened<00:05:46.790> out<00:05:46.910> team<00:05:47.240> the

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
kind of an evened out team the

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.570 
kind of an evened out team the
differences<00:05:48.410> between<00:05:48.590> the<00:05:48.919> team<00:05:49.130> are<00:05:49.430> just

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
differences between the team are just

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.270 
differences between the team are just
the<00:05:50.300> dice<00:05:50.510> there's<00:05:51.229> no<00:05:51.530> other<00:05:51.710> differences

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
the dice there's no other differences

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.710 
the dice there's no other differences
there's<00:05:52.490> no<00:05:52.610> cards<00:05:53.090> no<00:05:53.150> special<00:05:53.630> abilities

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 
there's no cards no special abilities

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.560 
there's no cards no special abilities
and<00:05:54.200> so<00:05:54.860> you<00:05:55.280> really<00:05:55.729> could<00:05:55.940> just<00:05:55.970> pull<00:05:56.360> some

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.570 
and so you really could just pull some

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.480 
and so you really could just pull some
random<00:05:56.900> dice<00:05:57.110> out<00:05:57.320> of<00:05:57.440> the<00:05:57.500> box<00:05:57.680> but<00:05:58.160> it's<00:05:58.310> good

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
random dice out of the box but it's good

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.040 
random dice out of the box but it's good
to<00:05:58.640> know<00:05:58.820> what<00:05:59.000> you're<00:05:59.210> playing<00:05:59.450> and<00:05:59.720> it's

now<00:06:17.200> I<00:06:17.470> like<00:06:18.040> this<00:06:18.340> I<00:06:18.640> I<00:06:19.420> think<00:06:19.990> you<00:06:20.380> don't<00:06:20.560> need

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:20.920 
now I like this I I think you don't need

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.450 
now I like this I I think you don't need
every<00:06:21.990> expansion<00:06:22.990> box<00:06:23.200> I<00:06:23.590> think<00:06:23.830> for<00:06:24.280> most

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
every expansion box I think for most

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.610 
every expansion box I think for most
people<00:06:24.640> two<00:06:25.240> of<00:06:25.450> them<00:06:25.600> would<00:06:25.780> suffice<00:06:26.050> because

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:26.620 
people two of them would suffice because

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:27.780 
people two of them would suffice because
you're<00:06:26.740> gonna<00:06:26.830> get<00:06:27.010> eight<00:06:27.190> teams<00:06:27.520> that<00:06:27.730> would

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:27.790 
you're gonna get eight teams that would

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.720 
you're gonna get eight teams that would
give<00:06:27.940> you<00:06:28.030> a<00:06:28.060> lot<00:06:28.270> and<00:06:28.540> in<00:06:29.260> each<00:06:29.560> box<00:06:29.950> there's

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:30.730 
give you a lot and in each box there's

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.300 
give you a lot and in each box there's
usually<00:06:31.030> one<00:06:31.480> good<00:06:32.110> passing<00:06:32.590> team<00:06:32.620> one<00:06:33.070> good

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
usually one good passing team one good

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.910 
usually one good passing team one good
running<00:06:33.700> team<00:06:33.910> one<00:06:34.240> good<00:06:34.420> defensive<00:06:34.900> team<00:06:35.140> and

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:35.920 
running team one good defensive team and

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.440 
running team one good defensive team and
you<00:06:36.340> can<00:06:36.520> look<00:06:36.730> through<00:06:36.880> the<00:06:37.000> different<00:06:37.300> box

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:37.450 
you can look through the different box

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:39.750 
you can look through the different box
and<00:06:37.660> see<00:06:37.810> what<00:06:37.930> you<00:06:38.020> want<00:06:38.280> you<00:06:39.280> know<00:06:39.400> like<00:06:39.430> for

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:39.760 
and see what you want you know like for

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.300 
and see what you want you know like for
example<00:06:39.790> this<00:06:40.210> box<00:06:40.450> has<00:06:40.750> very<00:06:41.230> very<00:06:41.560> strong

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:42.310 
example this box has very very strong

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.330 
example this box has very very strong
differences<00:06:43.300> and<00:06:43.510> other<00:06:44.230> boxes<00:06:44.770> the

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:45.340 
differences and other boxes the

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.360 
differences and other boxes the
differences<00:06:45.910> mate<00:06:46.180> might<00:06:46.450> be<00:06:46.600> more<00:06:46.870> subtle

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:47.370 
differences mate might be more subtle

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:50.130 
differences mate might be more subtle
but<00:06:48.370> you<00:06:48.550> know<00:06:48.700> for<00:06:48.910> me<00:06:49.030> I<00:06:49.060> managed<00:06:49.690> to<00:06:49.750> get<00:06:49.930> all

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:50.140 
but you know for me I managed to get all

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:51.420 
but you know for me I managed to get all
the<00:06:50.320> teams<00:06:50.560> and<00:06:50.740> I<00:06:50.800> think<00:06:51.040> that's<00:06:51.190> a<00:06:51.280> great

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.430 
the teams and I think that's a great

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.400 
the teams and I think that's a great
thing<00:06:51.790> so<00:06:52.150> it's<00:06:52.750> up<00:06:52.930> to<00:06:52.960> you

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:53.410 
thing so it's up to you

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.680 
thing so it's up to you
either<00:06:53.860> way<00:06:54.250> the<00:06:54.910> with<00:06:55.090> all<00:06:55.300> this<00:06:55.480> variety

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:55.690 
either way the with all this variety

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.260 
either way the with all this variety
between<00:06:56.110> teams<00:06:56.680> it's<00:06:56.980> tons<00:06:57.310> of<00:06:57.520> fun<00:06:57.580> yes<00:06:58.030> they

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:58.270 
between teams it's tons of fun yes they

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.990 
between teams it's tons of fun yes they
are<00:06:58.300> not<00:06:58.570> actual<00:06:59.230> real<00:06:59.530> teams<00:06:59.890> but<00:07:00.610> you<00:07:00.790> could

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 
are not actual real teams but you could

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.210 
are not actual real teams but you could
pick<00:07:01.210> something<00:07:01.630> you<00:07:01.750> could<00:07:01.930> say<00:07:02.170> for<00:07:02.770> example

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:03.220 
pick something you could say for example

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.340 
pick something you could say for example
well<00:07:03.760> this<00:07:03.970> team<00:07:04.210> has<00:07:04.420> great<00:07:04.780> running<00:07:05.110> and

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:05.350 
well this team has great running and

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:08.460 
well this team has great running and
great<00:07:05.670> passing<00:07:06.670> and<00:07:06.850> not<00:07:07.630> so<00:07:07.810> good<00:07:08.020> defense

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:08.470 
great passing and not so good defense

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.590 
great passing and not so good defense
and<00:07:08.800> that<00:07:08.830> reminds<00:07:09.340> me<00:07:09.490> a<00:07:09.580> lot<00:07:09.820> of<00:07:09.880> the<00:07:10.420> New
