00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.980
 Hello everyone, today I'll show you how 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:21.050
 disassembling the bumper is a video that 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.480
 I do more than anything else to connect then 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.509
 to the replacement of the lighthouse because how 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.849
 well you will know to change the lighthouse you need 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:31.340
 disassemble bumper so I preferred 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.689
 make them separate these videos because 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.610
 each however concerns two things 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.710
 different 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.629
 then we begin nothing to disassemble 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.449
 bumper must unscrew the screws as 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.580
 you already see 21 eduli these two me 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:45.199
 lands and at the end so as to 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.180
 facilitate the work then at the end for 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:49.010
 logical pull practically we go to 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.379
 see the other twenty per hour in the first 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.119
 two screws are that in short that I do to you 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:57.199
 see I am below 

00:00:53.119 --> 00:01:00.260
 1 you see it here and the other one down here 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:04.420
 I miss you, but we 'll have another one 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:14.720
 pretty much nothing is a torx the t 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:18.859
 t 27 visit this also cited 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.890
 the other simply to the boys 

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:24.590
 always under the bumper there are others 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.850
 two vines there is one here is another 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.829
 on the other hand, of course we are 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.240
 close to the wheel so we also avoid 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:31.240
 this is always the usual torx 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.649
 so we basically have four 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:43.030
 below then laterally 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:45.340
 here is the wheel of course this is 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:50.140
 the side bumper we have from 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.729
 take advantage of these two screws one and then two 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.750
 there would be a third of evidence missing 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:57.340
 which is more on this water practically a 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.049
 me missing 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.670
 ok so I'm going to unscrew these screws 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.670
 also on the other side of course 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.629
 then after having hesitated the three screws a 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:20.249
 cross 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:24.329
 I discovered that there is another reality 

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:26.670
 than below 8 hexagonal 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:29.879
 so there is still this that holds you 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.170
 the bumper up here then goes 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.959
 unscrewing this is also the first time 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.790
 even for me who is taking it apart then 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:45.030
 in short, but also for me it is a discovery 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:47.519
 we say here it is but also of this 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.459
 here it is that the parts come off here 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:53.310
 there is even a location within which 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.530
 life and can can go and I think I need it 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.389
 to adjust we say the ledge of the 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.680
 bumper 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:03:00.709
 anyway we unscrewed from this door 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.780
 it should also be mentioned on the other side 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:06.239
 then we were going to pull down the 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:10.949
 bumper but we found out that they are there 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:15.060
 two other torx screws really is 

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:18.239
 difficult to avoid that is really 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.519
 difficult to access it practically necessary 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.659
 access it from below or at least I do 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.079
 I do from below because otherwise I don't 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:27.329
 I can and this is where we go to 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.829
 visit this one too 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.259
 and then also the others from the invention 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:37.799
 obviously from below then raised from 

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:40.579
 machine is true that they have loosened it 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.579
 I see your coming out 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:45.379
 we also do the other side and maybe ce 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.030
 we did it 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:49.590
 ok we unscrewed all the screws now 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.420
 these two are missing the last 2 of 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.920
 when on the other side then there 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.360
 let's put these too these are the 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.280
 last two so be careful 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.049
 because once we remove these i 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.390
 bumper could then give in short 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.400
 we put something under a cardboard box for 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.230
 example to avoid scratching it e 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.840
 let's go to unscrew we always take a 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.150
 our dear torx and in the suite here too 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.860
 and say something soft under 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.290
 if you are in two better so maybe one 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:17.400
 bumper keeps the other suites and not 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:20.220
 I know in short, you do mine honestly 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.389
 even if it is scratched 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.419
 sometimes it seems that I don't care about this 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:26.760
 car because in short many of you me 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:29.850
 they said how dirty she like the 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.260
 bonnet like dirty scratched latins 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.669
 etc. etc. 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.720
 it's not that I don't care and I want to, though 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:38.310
 in short, as in Rome, it was his age and 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:41.850
 in fact I will tell you by keeping it that way 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.680
 dirty striped I'm not even at 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.330
 in short, worry if someone I don't know 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.130
 for example, he opens the door for me 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.539
 rather than it is therefore even more 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.860
 I still want to keep quiet 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:05:01.190
 this way we are now also 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:05:01.190
 the other we see a little detached from the sides 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:10.120
 It will have a bit of crap 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:13.190
 naturally and that's it 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.389
 we removed the bumper from the girls 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.340
 I also show him from inside that yes 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:18.340
 see 12 much better up here 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:26.360
 1234 under the sides we have one two three 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.090
 cross vine 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.830
 this examines ask her the torx 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:36.020
 what is accessible from below 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:38.419
 nothing very uncomfortable after that it comes down 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.830
 the bumper to reassemble it 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:41.600
 of course I don't even show it 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.580
 because in short it is enough to go backwards 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.070
 of course with regards to the 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:49.070
 removing the headlight I will make a video a 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:51.020
 part it is especially the case here, however, Linko 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:52.970
 precisely you want to go and see it and nothing 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:57.220
 as usual I thank you for 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.220
 vision of course to the next
