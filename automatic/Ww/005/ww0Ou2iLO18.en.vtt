00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:15.779 
ceramic curling iron that I got off like
George<00:06:12.220> tour<00:06:12.430> com<00:06:13.260> and<00:06:14.260> I<00:06:14.830> just<00:06:15.160> curled<00:06:15.400> it<00:06:15.640> now

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:15.789 
George tour com and I just curled it now

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:17.880 
George tour com and I just curled it now
of<00:06:15.880> course<00:06:16.140> Monday<00:06:17.140> it<00:06:17.380> was<00:06:17.500> a<00:06:17.560> little<00:06:17.710> bit

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:17.890 
of course Monday it was a little bit

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:21.730 
of course Monday it was a little bit
curlier<00:06:18.490> than<00:06:19.710> what<00:06:20.710> it<00:06:20.830> is<00:06:20.919> right<00:06:20.979> now<00:06:21.220> but

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
curlier than what it is right now but

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.020 
curlier than what it is right now but
I<00:06:21.860> think<00:06:22.580> the<00:06:22.699> curls<00:06:23.090> fell<00:06:23.509> quite<00:06:24.080> nicely
