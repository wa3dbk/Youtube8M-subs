aggression<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:54.840> his<00:01:55.020> positioning<00:01:55.680> sometimes

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
aggression so his positioning sometimes

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.520 
aggression so his positioning sometimes
can<00:01:56.640> be<00:01:56.670> off<00:01:56.939> because<00:01:57.360> he<00:01:57.390> pushes<00:01:57.930> up<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.290> little

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
can be off because he pushes up a little

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.819

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
I'm not really sure I mean Falcao's

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.570

really played with a good target man

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.810 
really played with a good target man
because<00:05:03.560> I<00:05:03.650> don't<00:05:03.800> cross<00:05:04.010> the<00:05:04.250> ball<00:05:04.430> that<00:05:04.580> much
