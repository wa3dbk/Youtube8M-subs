and<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:10.170> know<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.799> way<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:10.979> can<00:02:11.129> draw<00:02:11.310> into

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
and you know that way you can draw into

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.110 
and you know that way you can draw into
some<00:02:12.630> good<00:02:12.810> cards

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120
