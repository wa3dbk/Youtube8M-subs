sole<00:03:26.470> so<00:03:27.220> we're<00:03:27.430> going<00:03:27.519> to<00:03:27.579> apply<00:03:27.909> that<00:03:28.269> with<00:03:28.709> a

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
sole so we're going to apply that with a

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.759 
sole so we're going to apply that with a
product<00:03:30.129> should<00:03:30.760> we<00:03:30.940> call<00:03:31.060> cork<00:03:31.360> Renu<00:03:31.769> takes

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769

up<00:03:32.950> a<00:03:33.040> lot

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.560 

now<00:03:38.820> the<00:03:38.880> cork<00:03:39.210> renew<00:03:39.600> goes<00:03:40.290> on<00:03:40.850> white<00:03:41.850> almost

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.380 

so<00:03:52.650> this<00:03:52.770> is<00:03:52.860> the<00:03:52.920> finished<00:03:53.190> product<00:03:53.640> as<00:03:54.240> you

resold and the court for new that we

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.400 
resold and the court for new that we
just<00:03:59.670> applied<00:04:00.060> it<00:04:00.090> as<00:04:00.300> completely<00:04:00.690> dried<00:04:01.050> so

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
just applied it as completely dried so

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.900 
just applied it as completely dried so

now there is a clear coating right
around<00:04:03.120> the<00:04:03.330> sandal<00:04:03.950> so<00:04:04.950> this<00:04:05.100> is<00:04:05.220> something

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580
