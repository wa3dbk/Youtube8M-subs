hello guys I'm from here and today I've
got<00:00:05.370> a<00:00:05.700> tutorial<00:00:06.660> on<00:00:06.870> how<00:00:06.960> to<00:00:07.080> install<00:00:07.259> a

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
got a tutorial on how to install a

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.140 
got a tutorial on how to install a
plugin<00:00:07.800> so<00:00:08.400> this<00:00:08.580> isn't<00:00:08.880> going<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:09.090> be

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
plugin so this isn't going to be

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.450 
plugin so this isn't going to be
advanced<00:00:09.960> or<00:00:10.110> even<00:00:10.500> a<00:00:10.710> little<00:00:10.890> bit<00:00:11.010> advanced

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
advanced or even a little bit advanced

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.520 
advanced or even a little bit advanced
this<00:00:11.760> is<00:00:11.849> just<00:00:12.030> going<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.210> be<00:00:12.269> basic<00:00:12.720> for<00:00:12.960> those

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
this is just going to be basic for those

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.110 
this is just going to be basic for those
people<00:00:13.740> who<00:00:13.920> really<00:00:14.250> have<00:00:14.400> no<00:00:14.670> idea<00:00:14.700> what

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
people who really have no idea what

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.000 
people who really have no idea what
they're<00:00:15.269> doing<00:00:15.300> just<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.139> give<00:00:16.260> them<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.439> shot

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
they're doing just to give them a shot

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.670 
they're doing just to give them a shot
idea<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.880> so<00:00:18.840> basically<00:00:18.960> I've<00:00:19.320> just<00:00:19.470> got<00:00:19.650> this

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
idea and so basically I've just got this

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.330 
idea and so basically I've just got this
plug-in<00:00:20.430> called<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.820> lumberjack<00:00:21.270> right<00:00:21.810> here

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
plug-in called the lumberjack right here

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.830 
plug-in called the lumberjack right here
it's<00:00:23.340> really<00:00:23.490> good<00:00:25.520> and<00:00:26.520> basically<00:00:26.910> i've

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
it's really good and basically i've

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.540 
it's really good and basically i've
already<00:00:27.960> downloaded<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.590> so<00:00:28.650> I<00:00:29.010> don't<00:00:29.400> need<00:00:29.490> to

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
already downloaded it so I don't need to

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.790 
already downloaded it so I don't need to
show<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.359> me<00:00:30.539> downloading<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.140> because<00:00:31.320> you

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
show you me downloading it because you

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.830 
show you me downloading it because you
have<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.010> go<00:00:32.099> through<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.309> out<00:00:32.400> fly<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.940> which

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
have to go through and out fly and which

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.540 
have to go through and out fly and which
I<00:00:33.989> recommend<00:00:34.199> you<00:00:34.559> do<00:00:34.800> because<00:00:35.220> it<00:00:35.309> really

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
I recommend you do because it really

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.520 
I recommend you do because it really
helps<00:00:35.640> out<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.180> person<00:00:36.809> who<00:00:36.930> makes<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.379> the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
helps out the person who makes it the

plugins<00:00:41.519> I<00:00:41.909> didn't<00:00:42.570> realize<00:00:42.600> this<00:00:43.019> at<00:00:43.199> first<00:00:43.379> I

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
plugins I didn't realize this at first I

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.229 
plugins I didn't realize this at first I
thought<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.769> wasn't<00:00:43.920> working<00:00:44.159> you<00:00:44.820> have<00:00:44.909> to<00:00:45.089> do

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
thought it wasn't working you have to do

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.439 
thought it wasn't working you have to do
/<00:00:45.629> lumberjack<00:00:46.199> nibble<00:00:46.589> and<00:00:47.239> sometimes<00:00:48.239> it

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
/ lumberjack nibble and sometimes it

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:51.439 
/ lumberjack nibble and sometimes it
depends<00:00:49.970> most<00:00:50.970> of<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.180> time<00:00:51.299> you<00:00:51.420> probably

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
depends most of the time you probably

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.450 
depends most of the time you probably
will<00:00:51.839> have<00:00:51.900> to<00:00:52.049> do<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:52.559> I'll<00:00:52.979> just<00:00:53.010> get<00:00:53.339> it

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
will have to do it so I'll just get it

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.799 
will have to do it so I'll just get it
on<00:00:53.549> my<00:00:53.729> downloads<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.869> if<00:00:55.470> I've<00:00:55.619> got<00:00:55.769> it<00:00:55.920> still
