00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
boxes moving the fence all the water and

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.090 
boxes moving the fence all the water and
feed<00:01:00.090> every<00:01:00.480> morning<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.379> getting<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.949> eggs

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
feed every morning and getting the eggs

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.830 
feed every morning and getting the eggs
and<00:01:02.460> then<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.699> finally<00:01:03.149> get<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:03.570> last

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
and then you finally get to this last

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.160 
and then you finally get to this last
step<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:05.180> actually<00:01:06.180> my<00:01:06.330> favorite<00:01:06.780> part<00:01:06.840> is

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
step and actually my favorite part is

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.340 
step and actually my favorite part is
probably<00:01:07.619> putting<00:01:07.890> them<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.549> boxes

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
probably putting them in the boxes

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:17.210 
probably putting them in the boxes
because<00:01:10.350> that's<00:01:10.560> truly<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.220> last<00:01:11.430> step<00:01:16.009> and<00:01:17.009> I

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
because that's truly the last step and I

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.450 
because that's truly the last step and I
sort<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:18.000> like<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.200> have<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.710> bunch<00:01:20.369> of

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
sort of I like to have a bunch of

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.190 
sort of I like to have a bunch of
different<00:01:20.610> colors<00:01:21.119> in<00:01:21.150> each<00:01:21.479> box<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:22.170> I

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
different colors in each box so I

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.160 
different colors in each box so I
actually<00:01:22.850> do<00:01:23.850> put<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.119> little<00:01:24.299> bit<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.600> time<00:01:24.810> or

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
actually do put a little bit of time or

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.280 
actually do put a little bit of time or
thought<00:01:25.470> into<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:26.009> which<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:26.880> fun<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:28.080> feel

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
thought into that which is fun to feel

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.800 
thought into that which is fun to feel
