00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.630 
might actually appear suffern because
the<00:01:51.869> colors<00:01:52.140> are<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.320> oversaturated<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:53.549> is

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
the colors are so oversaturated it is

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.010 
the colors are so oversaturated it is
still<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.820> very<00:01:54.030> good<00:01:54.240> camera<00:01:54.570> though<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:54.960> is

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
still a very good camera though it is

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.280 
still a very good camera though it is
very<00:01:55.259> fast<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:56.000> it<00:01:57.000> takes<00:01:57.600> very<00:01:57.689> decent

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
very fast and it takes very decent

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.520 
very fast and it takes very decent
selfies<00:01:58.680> as<00:01:58.950> well<00:01:59.280> as<00:01:59.430> regular<00:02:00.390> pictures<00:02:00.899> for

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
selfies as well as regular pictures for

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.380 
selfies as well as regular pictures for
people<00:02:01.770> who<00:02:01.829> really<00:02:02.009> want<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.340> push<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.579> then

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
people who really want to push it then

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.539 
people who really want to push it then
maybe<00:02:03.810> this<00:02:04.380> is<00:02:04.469> not<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.649> great<00:02:04.890> camera<00:02:05.250> but

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
maybe this is not a great camera but

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.339 
maybe this is not a great camera but
it's<00:02:05.640> still<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.820> very<00:02:06.000> good<00:02:06.240> guy

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
it's still a very good guy

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.110 
it's still a very good guy
so<00:02:09.349> no<00:02:09.739> major<00:02:10.009> negatives<00:02:10.550> with<00:02:10.729> this<00:02:10.849> phone

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
so no major negatives with this phone

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.020 
so no major negatives with this phone
maybe<00:02:11.480> it's<00:02:11.660> a<00:02:11.750> bit<00:02:11.959> heavy<00:02:12.190> it<00:02:13.190> does<00:02:13.400> feel<00:02:13.730> more

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
maybe it's a bit heavy it does feel more

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.240 
maybe it's a bit heavy it does feel more
heavy<00:02:14.239> than<00:02:14.540> any<00:02:15.290> other<00:02:15.500> phone<00:02:15.709> in<00:02:15.830> this<00:02:15.950> range

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
heavy than any other phone in this range

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.360 
heavy than any other phone in this range
