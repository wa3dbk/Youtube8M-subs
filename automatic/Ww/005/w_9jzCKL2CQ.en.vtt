00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
sometimes Bluetooth the connectivity can

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.910 
sometimes Bluetooth the connectivity can
um<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:19.600> craps<00:01:19.869> out<00:01:20.049> unless<00:01:20.290> every<00:01:20.560> once<00:01:20.740> in<00:01:20.860> a

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
um it craps out unless every once in a

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.830 
um it craps out unless every once in a
while<00:01:21.040> let's<00:01:21.250> be<00:01:21.400> realistic<00:01:21.700> here<00:01:21.939> so<00:01:22.329> with

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
to 18 months of battery life which you

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.699 
to 18 months of battery life which you
know<00:02:45.420> that's<00:02:45.630> all<00:02:45.840> that's<00:02:46.170> a<00:02:46.260> long<00:02:46.470> time<00:02:46.650> I

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
know that's all that's a long time I

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:47.960 
know that's all that's a long time I
guess<00:02:46.980> it<00:02:47.100> depends<00:02:47.370> on<00:02:47.520> how<00:02:47.730> good<00:02:47.790> your

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
guess it depends on how good your

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.390 
guess it depends on how good your
batteries<00:02:48.300> are<00:02:48.420> but<00:02:48.989> it<00:02:49.560> just<00:02:49.800> also<00:02:50.160> takes

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
batteries are but it just also takes

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.340 
batteries are but it just also takes
just<00:02:50.700> one<00:02:51.000> double-a<00:02:51.600> which<00:02:51.750> is<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:51.900> nice<00:02:52.050> bonus

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
just one double-a which is a nice bonus

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.780 
just one double-a which is a nice bonus
because<00:02:52.650> I've<00:02:52.830> had<00:02:53.010> some<00:02:53.220> before<00:02:53.340> that<00:02:53.640> date

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
because I've had some before that date

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.990 
because I've had some before that date
two<00:02:54.060> or<00:02:54.390> sometimes<00:02:54.780> even<00:02:55.050> more<00:02:55.380> so<00:02:55.920> that's<00:02:56.760> it

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
two or sometimes even more so that's it
