we're<00:00:00.539> here<00:00:00.750> talking<00:00:01.429> uncommon<00:00:02.429> core

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
we're here talking uncommon core

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.700 
we're here talking uncommon core
exercises<00:00:03.149> for<00:00:03.600> runners<00:00:03.929> we're<00:00:04.500> going<00:00:04.650> to

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
exercises for runners we're going to

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:18.220 
exercises for runners we're going to
first<00:00:04.980> tackle<00:00:05.250> the<00:00:05.580> gymnastics<00:00:06.299> via

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.960 

in<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.470> previous<00:00:19.800> video<00:00:19.919> we've<00:00:20.220> done<00:00:20.489> we<00:00:20.699> talked

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
in a previous video we've done we talked

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.700 
in a previous video we've done we talked
about<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.390> importance<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:21.960> core<00:00:22.230> strength<00:00:22.439> in

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
about the importance of core strength in

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.130 
about the importance of core strength in
the<00:00:22.829> first<00:00:23.070> place<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.520> we<00:00:24.480> talked<00:00:24.750> about<00:00:24.900> the

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
the first place and we talked about the

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.229 
the first place and we talked about the
importance<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.680> core<00:00:26.009> strength<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.489> stabilize

00:00:27.229 --> 00:00:27.239 
importance of core strength to stabilize

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:30.470 
importance of core strength to stabilize
the<00:00:27.660> spine<00:00:27.779> if<00:00:28.259> I<00:00:28.800> can<00:00:29.009> stabilize<00:00:29.520> the<00:00:29.759> spine<00:00:29.939> I

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
the spine if I can stabilize the spine I

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.569 
the spine if I can stabilize the spine I
have<00:00:31.110> really<00:00:31.529> good<00:00:31.680> motor<00:00:31.980> control<00:00:32.399> which

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
have really good motor control which

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.430 
have really good motor control which
means<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:33.000> I've<00:00:33.120> got<00:00:33.329> excellent<00:00:33.750> control<00:00:34.289> of

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
means that I've got excellent control of

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.760 
means that I've got excellent control of
my<00:00:34.620> arms<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.190> my<00:00:35.340> legs<00:00:35.370> if<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:36.780> fall<00:00:37.170> apart<00:00:37.320> in

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
my arms and my legs if I fall apart in

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.310 
my arms and my legs if I fall apart in
the<00:00:37.829> spine<00:00:38.399> as<00:00:38.670> we<00:00:38.820> are<00:00:38.940> apt<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.270> do<00:00:39.450> we<00:00:40.020> lose

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
the spine as we are apt to do we lose

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.619 
the spine as we are apt to do we lose
motor<00:00:40.710> control<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.520> we<00:00:41.760> lose<00:00:42.000> control<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.480> our

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
motor control and we lose control of our

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.780 
motor control and we lose control of our
arms<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:42.989> legs<00:00:43.050> we<00:00:43.650> cannot<00:00:44.010> run<00:00:44.400> very<00:00:44.730> well

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:44.790 
arms and legs we cannot run very well

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.660 
arms and legs we cannot run very well
now<00:00:45.720> we<00:00:46.020> have<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.170> understand<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:46.890> for<00:00:47.280> core

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
now we have to understand that for core

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.060 
now we have to understand that for core
strength<00:00:48.060> we<00:00:48.510> have<00:00:48.540> to<00:00:48.899> stabilize<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.680> protect

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
strength we have to stabilize to protect

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.729 
strength we have to stabilize to protect
our<00:00:50.220> spine<00:00:50.489> under<00:00:51.300> pushing<00:00:52.020> forces<00:00:52.530> and

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
our spine under pushing forces and

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.620 
our spine under pushing forces and
pulling<00:00:53.460> forces<00:00:53.790> and<00:00:54.060> if<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.210> think<00:00:54.510> about

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:54.630 
pulling forces and if you think about

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.690 
pulling forces and if you think about
when<00:00:54.930> we<00:00:55.079> run<00:00:55.320> there's<00:00:55.950> an<00:00:56.070> aspect<00:00:56.340> when<00:00:56.610> we

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700 
when we run there's an aspect when we

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.120 
when we run there's an aspect when we
push<00:00:57.000> off<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.360> ground<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.989> this<00:00:58.440> leg<00:00:58.649> travels

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.130 
push off the ground and this leg travels

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.280 
push off the ground and this leg travels
back<00:00:59.280> up<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.700> pulls<00:01:00.030> off<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.239> ground<00:01:00.630> there's

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
back up and pulls off the ground there's

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.440 
back up and pulls off the ground there's
a<00:01:01.350> push<00:01:01.739> off<00:01:01.950> the<00:01:02.130> ground<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.700> then<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> pull

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:03.450 
a push off the ground and then a pull

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.870 
a push off the ground and then a pull
we're<00:01:04.259> naturally<00:01:04.439> pretty<00:01:04.949> good<00:01:05.189> when<00:01:05.430> we<00:01:05.549> push

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
we're naturally pretty good when we push

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.209 
we're naturally pretty good when we push
we<00:01:06.149> have<00:01:06.270> no<00:01:06.479> problem<00:01:06.840> stabilizing<00:01:07.500> there<00:01:07.680> but

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:08.219 
we have no problem stabilizing there but

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:10.880 
we have no problem stabilizing there but
we<00:01:08.399> break<00:01:08.700> down<00:01:08.729> when<00:01:09.299> we<00:01:09.420> have<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.810> pull<00:01:10.259> so

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
we break down when we have to pull so

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.620 
we break down when we have to pull so
we're<00:01:11.070> going<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.250> focus<00:01:11.520> on<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:11.909> gymnastics

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
we're going to focus on this gymnastics

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.190 
we're going to focus on this gymnastics
v<00:01:12.869> up<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.170> emphasize<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.640> pole<00:01:15.209> so<00:01:15.869> we've<00:01:16.020> got

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
v up to emphasize that pole so we've got

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.139 
v up to emphasize that pole so we've got
better<00:01:16.439> core<00:01:16.740> stability<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.579> that<00:01:17.729> we<00:01:17.819> can<00:01:17.999> run

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149 
better core stability so that we can run

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:21.230 
better core stability so that we can run
faster<00:01:18.659> for<00:01:18.929> longer<00:01:19.100> first<00:01:20.100> position<00:01:20.639> I<00:01:20.789> can<00:01:21.119> I

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
faster for longer first position I can I

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.620 
faster for longer first position I can I
find<00:01:21.600> my<00:01:21.899> hollow<00:01:22.229> body<00:01:22.619> I'm<00:01:22.859> going<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.069> start

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
find my hollow body I'm going to start

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.209 
find my hollow body I'm going to start
low<00:01:24.630> back<00:01:24.840> pressed<00:01:25.139> hard<00:01:25.380> on<00:01:25.499> to<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.649> ground<00:01:25.889> I

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:26.219 
low back pressed hard on to the ground I

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:29.239 
low back pressed hard on to the ground I

my arms to you from here if I have this
I'm<00:01:31.829> going<00:01:32.039> to<00:01:32.100> slowly<00:01:32.340> curl<00:01:32.789> up<00:01:32.999> knees<00:01:33.869> nice

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
I'm going to slowly curl up knees nice

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.309 
I'm going to slowly curl up knees nice
and<00:01:34.829> tall<00:01:35.209> focus<00:01:36.209> control<00:01:36.630> on<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.899> way<00:01:37.020> down

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:37.319 
and tall focus control on the way down

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:39.379 
and tall focus control on the way down
that<00:01:37.979> focus<00:01:38.399> controlling<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.909> way<00:01:38.999> down<00:01:39.179> is

00:01:39.379 --> 00:01:39.389 
that focus controlling the way down is

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:42.349 
that focus controlling the way down is
the<00:01:39.599> pole<00:01:39.840> once<00:01:40.709> I'm<00:01:40.889> here<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.340> can<00:01:42.179> then<00:01:42.329> just

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:42.359 
the pole once I'm here I can then just

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:45.499 
the pole once I'm here I can then just
find<00:01:43.319> this<00:01:43.619> if<00:01:44.249> I<00:01:44.340> have<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.759> feet<00:01:45.149> straight

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
find this if I have that feet straight

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.309 
find this if I have that feet straight
toes<00:01:46.109> pointed<00:01:46.619> at<00:01:47.549> all<00:01:47.880> folks<00:01:48.630> gonna<00:01:48.869> pull<00:01:49.170> the

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:49.319 
toes pointed at all folks gonna pull the

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:52.039 
toes pointed at all folks gonna pull the
way<00:01:49.409> down<00:01:49.590> up<00:01:50.130> tall<00:01:50.520> focus<00:01:51.450> on<00:01:51.569> the<00:01:51.659> pole<00:01:51.899> the

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
way down up tall focus on the pole the

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.559 
way down up tall focus on the pole the
way<00:01:52.170> down<00:01:52.409> so<00:01:53.279> this<00:01:53.490> V<00:01:53.669> up<00:01:53.789> is<00:01:53.939> tricky<00:01:54.389> because

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:54.569 
way down so this V up is tricky because

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:55.940 
way down so this V up is tricky because
a<00:01:54.749> lot<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.079> times<00:01:55.319> we<00:01:55.499> lack<00:01:55.679> a<00:01:55.709> little

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
a lot of times we lack a little

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.129 
a lot of times we lack a little
flexibility<00:01:56.700> in<00:01:56.849> those<00:01:56.969> hamstrings<00:01:57.450> we<00:01:58.049> have

00:01:58.129 --> 00:01:58.139 
flexibility in those hamstrings we have

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:59.749 
flexibility in those hamstrings we have
a<00:01:58.200> hard<00:01:58.439> time<00:01:58.590> hinging<00:01:59.159> up<00:01:59.279> all<00:01:59.429> the<00:01:59.549> way<00:01:59.639> at
