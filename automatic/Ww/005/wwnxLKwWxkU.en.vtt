need for China to build up its airport

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.080 
need for China to build up its airport
capacity<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:37.620> think<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.190> in<00:00:38.579> terms<00:00:38.910> of

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
capacity I think the in terms of

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.959 
capacity I think the in terms of
structural<00:00:39.450> challenge<00:00:39.930> for<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:40.980> airport<00:00:41.460> we

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
structural challenge for the airport we

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.610 
structural challenge for the airport we
can<00:00:42.210> we<00:00:42.870> use<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.940> area<00:00:44.960> one<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.379> roof

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
can we use to area one is the roof

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.160 
can we use to area one is the roof
because<00:00:47.129> room<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.210> big<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:49.020> other

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
because room is so big the other

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.850 
because room is so big the other
challenge<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.340> building<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:51.090> so<00:00:51.510> long<00:00:51.899> one

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
challenge is the building is so long one

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.779 
challenge is the building is so long one
terminal<00:00:53.160> why<00:00:53.699> we<00:00:53.910> talk<00:00:54.120> about<00:00:55.610> 950<00:00:56.610> meter

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789

right<00:00:57.360> along<00:00:58.199> this<00:00:58.350> one<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.160> other

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
right along this one and the other

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.760 
right along this one and the other
dimension<00:00:59.850> is<00:00:59.969> about<00:01:00.210> 750<00:01:00.899> meter<00:01:01.230> when<00:01:01.649> you

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
open into very large open spaces you get

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.210 
open into very large open spaces you get
very<00:01:15.180> impressive<00:01:15.810> vistas<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.950> roof

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
very impressive vistas of the roof

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.609 
very impressive vistas of the roof
disappearing<00:01:18.090> off<00:01:18.299> into<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.780> distance<00:01:18.960> and

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
disappearing off into the distance and

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.999 
disappearing off into the distance and
some<00:01:20.490> idea<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:21.090> it's<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.360> eternal<00:01:22.350> as<00:01:22.950> a

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
some idea that it's a eternal as a

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.590 
some idea that it's a eternal as a
passenger<00:01:23.610> when<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.790> come<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.390> Beijing

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
passenger when I come to the Beijing

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.800 
passenger when I come to the Beijing
Airport<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:25.259> think<00:01:25.530> what<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.450> most<00:01:27.450> impresses

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
Airport I think what I most impresses

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.179 
Airport I think what I most impresses
the<00:01:28.229> very<00:01:29.100> clear<00:01:29.340> signage<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:31.320> way<00:01:31.890> that

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
the very clear signage and the way that

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.310 
the very clear signage and the way that
the<00:01:32.400> building<00:01:32.579> directs<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:33.930> design

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
the building directs you that is design

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.350 
the building directs you that is design
to<00:01:34.590> where<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.369> want<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.670> go<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:36.030> think<00:01:36.240> that's

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
to where you want to go I think that's

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.830 
to where you want to go I think that's
very<00:01:36.509> important<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.380> you're<00:01:37.680> not<00:01:37.799> so<00:01:38.189> lost

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
very important and you're not so lost

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.660 
very important and you're not so lost

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
river within the airport a very clever

river within the airport a very clever
aspect<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.420> design<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.170> orientation

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
aspect of the design is the orientation

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.819 
aspect of the design is the orientation
of<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.280> ceiling<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.570> this<00:01:45.930> big<00:01:46.170> large<00:01:46.350> space

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.500 
quality but now we demonstrate that you
know<00:02:17.330> what<00:02:18.200> all<00:02:18.610> maybe<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.790> first<00:02:19.970> day<00:02:20.269> or<00:02:20.480> two

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
know what all maybe the first day or two

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.199 
know what all maybe the first day or two
I<00:02:21.110> think<00:02:21.170> it's<00:02:21.560> impossible<00:02:21.950> but<00:02:22.640> now<00:02:22.910> is

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
I think it's impossible but now is

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.930 
I think it's impossible but now is
possible
