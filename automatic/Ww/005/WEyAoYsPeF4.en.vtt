00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.680 
it's kind of the tricky thing about
brakes<00:01:44.520> they<00:01:44.820> all<00:01:44.940> kind<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.270> do<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.390> very

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
brakes they all kind of do a very

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.200 
brakes they all kind of do a very
similar<00:01:46.020> thing<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.760> subtle<00:01:47.760> differences

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
similar thing and subtle differences

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.790 
similar thing and subtle differences
only<00:01:48.480> get<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.750> subtle<00:01:49.110> changes<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.680> it's

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
only get you subtle changes and it's

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.180 
only get you subtle changes and it's
just<00:01:50.010> one<00:01:50.280> piece<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:51.860> figure<00:01:52.860> out<00:01:52.950> what<00:01:53.100> it

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
just one piece of a figure out what it

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.360 
just one piece of a figure out what it
does

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
does

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.850 
does
and<00:01:53.700> really<00:01:54.180> well<00:01:55.050> I<00:01:55.080> do<00:01:55.260> feel<00:01:55.380> pretty

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
and really well I do feel pretty

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.890 
and really well I do feel pretty
strongly<00:01:56.160> that<00:01:56.430> this<00:01:56.940> is<00:01:57.150> a<00:01:57.180> standard<00:01:57.600> by

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
strongly that this is a standard by

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.680 
strongly that this is a standard by
which<00:01:57.930> other<00:01:58.380> muzzle<00:01:58.860> brakes<00:01:59.070> are<00:01:59.250> judged<00:01:59.690> we

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
which other muzzle brakes are judged we

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.990 
which other muzzle brakes are judged we
see<00:02:00.870> a<00:02:00.900> lot<00:02:01.050> of<00:02:01.080> the<00:02:01.200> major<00:02:01.380> companies<00:02:02.000> out

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
see a lot of the major companies out

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.400 
see a lot of the major companies out
there<00:02:03.030> right<00:02:03.300> there<00:02:03.510> they<00:02:03.660> got<00:02:03.840> this<00:02:03.990> on<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.200> F

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
there right there they got this on the F

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.080 
there right there they got this on the F
and<00:02:07.130> when<00:02:08.130> they<00:02:08.220> first<00:02:08.459> came<00:02:08.670> out<00:02:08.850> with<00:02:08.910> it

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
and when they first came out with it

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.810 
and when they first came out with it
before<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.509> insides<00:02:09.840> of<00:02:09.990> butcher<00:02:10.380> yeah<00:02:10.890> you

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
before the insides of butcher yeah you

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.360 
before the insides of butcher yeah you
know<00:02:11.880> the<00:02:12.060> list<00:02:12.450> goes<00:02:12.540> on<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:13.020> on<00:02:13.110> but<00:02:13.380> this<00:02:14.220> is

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
know the list goes on and on but this is

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.220 
know the list goes on and on but this is
kind<00:02:14.610> of<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.820> base<00:02:15.270> that<00:02:15.300> a<00:02:15.540> lot<00:02:15.720> of<00:02:15.840> people<00:02:16.050> go

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
kind of a base that a lot of people go

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.860 
kind of a base that a lot of people go
to<00:02:16.260> so<00:02:16.709> I<00:02:16.739> kind<00:02:17.280> of<00:02:17.310> look<00:02:17.489> at<00:02:17.580> it<00:02:17.670> that<00:02:17.940> way<00:02:18.180> my

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
to so I kind of look at it that way my

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.210 
to so I kind of look at it that way my
own<00:02:19.050> when<00:02:19.350> somebody<00:02:19.650> comes<00:02:19.770> out<00:02:19.980> with<00:02:20.070> new

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
own when somebody comes out with new

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.830 
own when somebody comes out with new
striker-fired<00:02:20.520> pistol<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:21.420> know<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:21.540> can<00:02:21.720> do

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
striker-fired pistol you know I can do

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.540 
striker-fired pistol you know I can do
all<00:02:22.080> kinds<00:02:22.380> of<00:02:22.440> great<00:02:22.590> things<00:02:22.650> but<00:02:25.400> maybe<00:02:26.400> it

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
all kinds of great things but maybe it

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.710 
all kinds of great things but maybe it
is<00:02:26.640> maybe<00:02:26.820> it<00:02:27.030> isn't<00:02:27.120> but<00:02:27.390> you<00:02:27.450> know<00:02:27.570> they're

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
is maybe it isn't but you know they're

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.060 
is maybe it isn't but you know they're
talking<00:02:27.989> about<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.260> Glock<00:02:28.470> when<00:02:28.739> they<00:02:28.830> when

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
talking about the Glock when they when

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.010 
talking about the Glock when they when
they<00:02:29.190> ask<00:02:29.310> what<00:02:29.520> it<00:02:29.850> does<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.600> I<00:02:30.630> kind<00:02:30.810> of<00:02:30.870> feel

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
they ask what it does and I kind of feel

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.170 
they ask what it does and I kind of feel
like<00:02:31.050> sure<00:02:31.350> fires<00:02:31.590> that<00:02:31.860> way<00:02:32.070> with<00:02:33.000> their

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
like sure fires that way with their

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.510 
like sure fires that way with their
compensators<00:02:33.950> you<00:02:34.950> know<00:02:35.040> there<00:02:35.190> are<00:02:35.280> they're

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
compensators you know there are they're

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.760 
compensators you know there are they're
a<00:02:35.550> single<00:02:35.940> part<00:02:36.239> dual<00:02:36.780> port<00:02:37.140> like<00:02:37.350> this<00:02:37.560> one

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
a single part dual port like this one

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.770 
a single part dual port like this one
and<00:02:37.980> three<00:02:38.580> port<00:02:38.850> compensators

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
and three port compensators

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.350 
and three port compensators
I<00:02:40.130> think<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.250> dual<00:02:41.430> port<00:02:41.700> is<00:02:42.000> kind<00:02:42.360> of<00:02:42.530> the

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
I think the dual port is kind of the

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.080 
I think the dual port is kind of the
just<00:02:45.360> right<00:02:46.370> recipe<00:02:47.370> there<00:02:47.610> I<00:02:47.640> think<00:02:47.820> there's

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
just right recipe there I think there's

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.220 
just right recipe there I think there's
kind<00:02:48.209> of<00:02:48.299> a<00:02:48.390> diminishing<00:02:48.810> return<00:02:49.080> on

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
kind of a diminishing return on

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.810 
kind of a diminishing return on
three-point<00:02:49.739> okay<00:02:50.100> they're<00:02:50.340> three<00:02:50.519> port

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
three-point okay they're three port

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.050 
three-point okay they're three port
muzzle<00:02:51.420> brakes<00:02:51.630> yeah<00:02:52.110> it's<00:02:52.680> still<00:02:52.890> light<00:02:53.280> for

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
muzzle brakes yeah it's still light for

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.610 
muzzle brakes yeah it's still light for
for<00:02:54.360> what<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.630> is<00:02:54.750> I<00:02:54.780> mean<00:02:55.019> it's<00:02:55.140> machined<00:02:55.470> on<00:02:55.590> a

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
for what it is I mean it's machined on a

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.800 
for what it is I mean it's machined on a
stainless<00:02:55.860> steel<00:02:56.120> it's<00:02:57.120> not<00:02:57.269> bulky

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
stainless steel it's not bulky

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.750 
stainless steel it's not bulky
it's<00:02:58.790> very<00:02:59.790> trim<00:03:00.150> very<00:03:00.510> form-factor

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
it's very trim very form-factor

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.839 
it's very trim very form-factor
conscious<00:03:02.760> and<00:03:03.000> it's<00:03:03.600> taken<00:03:03.900> a<00:03:04.110> lot<00:03:04.320> of<00:03:04.350> abuse

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
conscious and it's taken a lot of abuse

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.020 
conscious and it's taken a lot of abuse
and<00:03:06.180> I've<00:03:06.989> never<00:03:07.170> seen<00:03:07.530> one<00:03:07.709> have<00:03:08.549> a<00:03:08.579> baffle

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
and I've never seen one have a baffle

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.709 
and I've never seen one have a baffle
strikes<00:03:09.329> on<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.810> more<00:03:10.579> the<00:03:11.579> closer<00:03:12.150> that<00:03:12.299> the

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:12.719 
strikes on the more the closer that the

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:15.050 
strikes on the more the closer that the
bore<00:03:13.200> is<00:03:13.230> to<00:03:14.040> your<00:03:14.219> bullet<00:03:14.639> the<00:03:14.879> more

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
bore is to your bullet the more

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.390 
bore is to your bullet the more
effective<00:03:15.510> it<00:03:15.629> will<00:03:15.749> be<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.170> some<00:03:16.980> some

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
effective it will be and some some

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.920 
effective it will be and some some
breaks<00:03:17.609> out<00:03:17.819> there<00:03:17.999> we<00:03:18.120> have<00:03:18.299> seen<00:03:18.569> they<00:03:18.749> get<00:03:18.900> a

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
breaks out there we have seen they get a

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.809 
breaks out there we have seen they get a
little<00:03:19.260> bit<00:03:19.409> too<00:03:19.590> close<00:03:19.769> or<00:03:20.099> it<00:03:20.159> flexes<00:03:20.549> over

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
little bit too close or it flexes over

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.520 
little bit too close or it flexes over
time<00:03:21.060> you<00:03:21.480> get<00:03:21.629> a<00:03:21.659> baffle<00:03:22.049> strike<00:03:22.290> and<00:03:22.439> then

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
time you get a baffle strike and then

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.619 
time you get a baffle strike and then
your<00:03:22.680> considers<00:03:23.549> destroy<00:03:23.939> most<00:03:24.269> of<00:03:24.389> the<00:03:24.480> guys

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:24.629 
your considers destroy most of the guys

the last couple of years after that I've
been<00:03:28.379> running<00:03:28.530> a<00:03:28.709> tightening<00:03:29.219> and<00:03:29.459> it<00:03:29.609> is<00:03:29.760> a

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.409 
been running a tightening and it is a
very<00:03:30.000> aggressive<00:03:30.329> yeah<00:03:31.489> I<00:03:32.489> do<00:03:32.549> like<00:03:32.819> it<00:03:33.030> a<00:03:33.090> lot

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:33.419 
very aggressive yeah I do like it a lot

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:35.839 
very aggressive yeah I do like it a lot
what<00:03:33.750> I<00:03:33.780> noticed<00:03:34.200> when<00:03:34.650> I<00:03:34.709> ran<00:03:34.950> this<00:03:35.189> was<00:03:35.430> I<00:03:35.459> did

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
what I noticed when I ran this was I did

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.089 
what I noticed when I ran this was I did
give<00:03:36.030> up<00:03:36.060> a<00:03:36.480> little<00:03:37.200> bit<00:03:37.349> of<00:03:37.499> that<00:03:37.560> dwell<00:03:37.859> time

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
give up a little bit of that dwell time

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:39.920 
give up a little bit of that dwell time
for<00:03:38.340> me<00:03:38.430> just<00:03:38.669> it<00:03:39.030> obviously<00:03:39.450> was<00:03:39.629> a<00:03:39.689> timing

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
for me just it obviously was a timing

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.420 
for me just it obviously was a timing
issue<00:03:40.169> because<00:03:40.500> I<00:03:40.560> kind<00:03:40.739> of<00:03:40.769> know<00:03:40.889> my<00:03:41.010> timing

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
issue because I kind of know my timing

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.589 
issue because I kind of know my timing
on<00:03:41.579> my<00:03:41.669> comp<00:03:42.169> but<00:03:43.639> it<00:03:44.639> took<00:03:44.819> enough<00:03:45.090> weight<00:03:45.359> off

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
on my comp but it took enough weight off

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:46.670 
on my comp but it took enough weight off
the<00:03:45.750> front<00:03:45.959> of<00:03:45.989> my<00:03:46.139> gun<00:03:46.349> that<00:03:46.379> I<00:03:46.560> actually

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
the front of my gun that I actually

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.709 
the front of my gun that I actually
noticed<00:03:46.949> a<00:03:47.129> ship<00:03:47.370> in<00:03:47.579> in<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.180> weight<00:03:48.359> you<00:03:48.599> know

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:48.719 
noticed a ship in in the weight you know

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:50.449 
noticed a ship in in the weight you know
in<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:49.019> in<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:49.349> point<00:03:49.620> of<00:03:49.769> sort<00:03:50.010> of<00:03:50.069> balance

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
in the in the point of sort of balance

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:51.709 
in the in the point of sort of balance
and<00:03:50.579> the<00:03:50.639> gun<00:03:50.819> came<00:03:51.060> back<00:03:51.239> a<00:03:51.269> little<00:03:51.540> further

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:51.719 
and the gun came back a little further

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:53.689 
and the gun came back a little further
and<00:03:52.079> it<00:03:52.439> made<00:03:52.560> my<00:03:52.709> 18<00:03:53.069> a<00:03:53.099> little<00:03:53.430> more<00:03:53.549> wheel

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:53.699 
and it made my 18 a little more wheel

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:55.339 
and it made my 18 a little more wheel
double<00:03:54.030> which<00:03:54.120> I<00:03:54.239> really<00:03:54.480> really<00:03:54.689> did<00:03:54.870> like<00:03:55.079> I

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
double which I really really did like I

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.319 
double which I really really did like I
didn't<00:03:56.129> get<00:03:56.189> enough<00:03:56.489> time<00:03:56.969> with<00:03:57.030> it

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
didn't get enough time with it

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.429 
didn't get enough time with it
unfortunately<00:03:57.419> to<00:03:57.989> say<00:03:58.199> you<00:03:59.129> know<00:03:59.250> this<00:04:00.090> is<00:04:00.299> a

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
of the chamber comm so we're gonna do

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.119 
of the chamber comm so we're gonna do
that<00:04:12.359> da<00:04:12.599> same<00:04:13.049> on<00:04:13.199> Rico<00:04:13.650> or<00:04:13.799> not<00:04:13.919> sure<00:04:14.009> we've

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
that da same on Rico or not sure we've

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:15.559 
that da same on Rico or not sure we've
talked<00:04:14.340> about<00:04:14.430> this<00:04:14.639> before<00:04:14.790> it's<00:04:15.090> like<00:04:15.269> like

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
talked about this before it's like like

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.029 
talked about this before it's like like
triggers<00:04:15.959> and<00:04:16.229> we<00:04:16.289> talked<00:04:16.500> about<00:04:16.620> in<00:04:16.769> some<00:04:16.949> of

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
triggers and we talked about in some of

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:18.379 
triggers and we talked about in some of
our<00:04:17.130> other<00:04:17.190> reviews<00:04:17.729> it's<00:04:17.909> very<00:04:18.120> subjective

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
our other reviews it's very subjective

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.330 
our other reviews it's very subjective
it's<00:04:18.930> it's<00:04:19.259> very<00:04:19.470> hard<00:04:19.709> to<00:04:19.799> objectively

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
it's it's very hard to objectively

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.850 
it's it's very hard to objectively
measure<00:04:20.609> how<00:04:21.449> much<00:04:21.659> a<00:04:21.720> gun<00:04:21.989> recoils<00:04:22.590> and<00:04:22.740> how

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
measure how much a gun recoils and how

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.890 
measure how much a gun recoils and how
much<00:04:23.070> it<00:04:23.340> recoils<00:04:23.729> over<00:04:24.090> another<00:04:24.360> one<00:04:24.570> yeah

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
much it recoils over another one yeah

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.540 
much it recoils over another one yeah
and<00:04:25.110> there's<00:04:25.470> there's<00:04:25.889> many<00:04:26.009> things<00:04:26.280> working

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
and there's there's many things working

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.490 
and there's there's many things working
in<00:04:26.849> harmony<00:04:27.120> when<00:04:27.630> we<00:04:27.720> talk<00:04:27.870> about<00:04:27.900> the<00:04:28.169> recoil

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
in harmony when we talk about the recoil

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.740 
in harmony when we talk about the recoil
impulse<00:04:28.620> when<00:04:28.979> I<00:04:29.070> ar-15<00:04:29.759> yeah<00:04:30.000> what<00:04:30.449> but<00:04:30.720> I

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
impulse when I ar-15 yeah what but I

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.570 
impulse when I ar-15 yeah what but I
certainly<00:04:31.199> think<00:04:31.470> this<00:04:31.680> is<00:04:31.800> a<00:04:31.830> top<00:04:32.310> choice<00:04:32.550> for

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
certainly think this is a top choice for

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.149 
certainly think this is a top choice for
consideration<00:04:33.210> for<00:04:33.630> sure<00:04:33.900> it's<00:04:34.770> the<00:04:34.919> first

00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:35.159 
consideration for sure it's the first

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:37.370 
consideration for sure it's the first
muzzle<00:04:35.639> brake<00:04:35.820> that<00:04:35.970> I<00:04:36.060> ever<00:04:36.240> bought<00:04:36.509> and<00:04:36.780> it's

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
muzzle brake that I ever bought and it's

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.050 
muzzle brake that I ever bought and it's
the<00:04:37.500> one<00:04:37.590> that<00:04:37.740> I<00:04:37.800> continued<00:04:38.190> to<00:04:38.250> put<00:04:38.490> on<00:04:38.639> all

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
the one that I continued to put on all

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.089 
the one that I continued to put on all
my<00:04:39.150> life<00:04:39.300> all<00:04:39.539> my<00:04:39.570> three<00:04:39.930> gun<00:04:40.080> rifles<00:04:40.470> where<00:04:40.770> a

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:41.099 
my life all my three gun rifles where a

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:43.430 
my life all my three gun rifles where a
surefire<00:04:41.340> muzzle<00:04:42.120> break<00:04:42.270> and<00:04:42.419> and<00:04:42.900> again<00:04:43.050> and

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
surefire muzzle break and and again and

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.629 
surefire muzzle break and and again and
we're<00:04:43.620> always<00:04:43.770> talking<00:04:44.009> about<00:04:44.159> price<00:04:44.430> point

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
we're always talking about price point

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.670 
we're always talking about price point
here<00:04:44.940> not<00:04:45.389> so<00:04:45.509> much<00:04:45.659> in<00:04:45.780> the<00:04:45.900> actual<00:04:46.289> dollars

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
here not so much in the actual dollars

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.830 
here not so much in the actual dollars
but<00:04:46.889> this<00:04:47.039> one<00:04:47.220> comes<00:04:47.430> in<00:04:47.610> right<00:04:48.449> down<00:04:48.599> there

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
but this one comes in right down there

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.390 
but this one comes in right down there
and<00:04:48.930> sort<00:04:49.139> of<00:04:49.199> the<00:04:49.289> bottom<00:04:49.620> of<00:04:49.710> the<00:04:49.770> constant

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
and sort of the bottom of the constant

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.339 
and sort of the bottom of the constant
world<00:04:50.520> of<00:04:50.699> Pro<00:04:50.880> Comp<00:04:51.120> is<00:04:51.330> pretty<00:04:51.750> economic

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:52.349 
world of Pro Comp is pretty economic

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:53.959 
world of Pro Comp is pretty economic
like<00:04:52.500> 60<00:04:52.919> bucks<00:04:52.949> seven<00:04:53.430> yeah<00:04:53.580> something<00:04:53.940> like

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:53.969 
like 60 bucks seven yeah something like

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:55.399 
like 60 bucks seven yeah something like
that<00:04:54.060> I<00:04:54.210> mean<00:04:54.389> that's<00:04:54.539> just<00:04:54.690> ridiculous<00:04:55.050> so<00:04:55.380> I

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:55.409
