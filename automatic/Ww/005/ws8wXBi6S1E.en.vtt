 polar makes at first a little nervous north again savored and 

00:00:17.989 --> 00:00:19.769
 azua no 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:20.989
 now they make 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:23.529
 he did not but Juan covered up already in 2d 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.529

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:33.670
 knight d 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.430
 the team in the first part 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.050
 cost us a bit at the beginning of 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.600
 then the second 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.370
 showed much more 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.370
 we have run many competitors and 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.510
 sometimes we have been superior 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.080
 shoes to puntito de salta final para 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.610
 jatamÃ­ to a chance to have 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.610
 it was a center that we have made with its power to the party 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.260
 yes, because we are going to go 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.170
 there are many points ahead you have to be positive 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.380
 think that 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.710
 that the team after a dynamic 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.760
 in the month of January very bad 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.520
 the other day for another fits 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.530
 in ayiroos obama face and 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.140
 and we're going to getafe for the three points 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.310
 today there will be more of the same 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.330
 although I had a couple of weeks without playing and going 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.320
 I really wanted to 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.650
 to participate deaf to help the team 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.910
 it is clear that 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.190
 frizz minutes little by little I'll be fine because I feel good 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.190
 I will contribute a lot to the good team 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.610
 it's not easy to come to a new leading club 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.260
 i great art 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.780
 and the respect of everyone from very little time 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.470
 I crank ham in worse than I see you will see that the beautiful and 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.360
 in the matches he provoked 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.900
 I try to work 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.450
 you can only vote with that I hope to convince the coach little by little 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.170
 mike callahan little more 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.170
 well it is clear that everyone comes very motivated and the pilot 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.650
 for the environment he has made 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.700
 for the respect that will remain in this field and one 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.540
 it was clarified then we with Iran could 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.540
 our people are with us and we run and we are committed 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:10.989
 a little bit the team will do to win here 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.989
 we can do it on time so we want to know europe 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:18.979
 open equal 

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:21.519
 one less game we have to get there 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.519
 but let's go working 

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:30.180
 but now we have that feeling too 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.059
 think they're going to go twice they make us hurt us whenever they're going to go 

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:39.129
 It costs us a lot to make goals and there they seem to go 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:40.759
 in the style more 

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:43.569
 you have to continue you have to work 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.899
 I think that luck also has to help us a little bit more than going to 

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:48.659
 change 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:51.659
 and let's go try to improve to change 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.389
 in our assignment 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:56.799
 with us 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.779
 one thing that I want to leave 

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:02.029
 what they were shouting my partner 

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:04.599
 that makes us a lot 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:05.839
 ask our hobby 

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:07.669
 the one who continues with us always 

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:09.419
 so if the player 

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:12.419
 lily was still playing the one that works that 

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:16.959
 to the team always 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.609
 Roque that was just fine the field I wanted to help I wanted to contribute more 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:21.499
 felt good 

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:24.609
 in how we were tied I wanted to continue to try to score the goal 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.859
 when when a tip is removed it is fine 

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:35.429
 that feeling remains but I do not think that this state 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:37.749
 the personal plane 

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:40.749
 it's not not important when when you see that you feel that the team 

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:45.189
 yes yes everything was very good yes very happy always 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:49.059
 but if the team is not good if the results are not as you want 

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:50.399
 personal plane 

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:51.689
 at least 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:53.709
 rejoice 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.289
 if they let see where it goes straight into the hands of another but good 

00:03:57.289 --> 00:04:00.289
 is a point of descent to no abandonment is not worth to 

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:04.469
 it's not going to need either 

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:06.810
 if it is full of bravery in the middle 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.579
 a neighboring store scoring goals 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:11.729
 it can continue 

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:14.639
 it extends from the first day it has been so 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.579
 out clear of toledo is also another state losing 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.629
 delibes and encouraging him 

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:21.319
 I think it's free 

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:24.610
 in this series time fields s 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.370
 and that's why he had an illness 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.189
 May soda 

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:30.069
 I do not know but 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:30.520
 the debt reduction
