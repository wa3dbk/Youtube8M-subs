00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
you guys can fit a little bit more we

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.100

need<00:02:18.819> to<00:02:18.970> turn<00:02:19.120> them<00:02:19.360> back<00:02:19.510> up<00:02:19.720> a<00:02:19.840> little<00:02:19.900> bit

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
need to turn them back up a little bit

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.030 
need to turn them back up a little bit
because<00:02:20.349> it's<00:02:20.560> a<00:02:20.620> bit<00:02:20.830> too<00:02:21.780> overpowering<00:02:23.040> but

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
because it's a bit too overpowering but

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.240 
because it's a bit too overpowering but
then<00:02:24.280> also<00:02:24.790> I<00:02:26.280> thought<00:02:28.950> when<00:02:29.950> I'm<00:02:30.069> watching
