this orthographic full overview and we
can<00:01:22.680> see<00:01:22.920> I've<00:01:23.130> got<00:01:23.640> three<00:01:24.000> parts<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.479> this<00:01:25.189> and

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
can see I've got three parts to this and

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.499 
can see I've got three parts to this and
it<00:01:26.400> looks<00:01:26.520> like<00:01:26.670> I'm<00:01:26.790> trying<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.119> select<00:01:27.360> that

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
it looks like I'm trying to select that

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.109 
it looks like I'm trying to select that
other<00:01:27.780> one<00:01:27.930> hit<00:01:28.140> tab<00:01:28.409> there<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:28.950> okay<00:01:29.430> so

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
other one hit tab there it is okay so

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.270 
other one hit tab there it is okay so
what<00:01:30.390> I'm<00:01:30.540> going<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.780> do<00:01:31.049> reason<00:01:31.680> why<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:31.829> one<00:01:32.100> do

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
what I'm going to do reason why I one do

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.130 
what I'm going to do reason why I one do
three<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:32.790> we<00:01:32.909> can<00:01:33.060> separate<00:01:33.540> out<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.900> tile

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
three is so we can separate out the tile

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.929 
three is so we can separate out the tile
let's<00:01:34.740> go<00:01:34.920> ahead<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.130> spray<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.640> with<00:01:35.790> some

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
let's go ahead and spray it with some

to<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.640> higher<00:02:02.909> color<00:02:03.270> camera<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:03.899> we<00:02:03.930> can<00:02:04.020> see

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
to the higher color camera so we can see

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.219 
to the higher color camera so we can see
the<00:02:04.530> detail<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.130> there<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.090> is<00:02:06.149> now<00:02:06.990> if<00:02:07.110> we

the detail and there it is now if we

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.499 
the detail and there it is now if we
knew<00:02:07.439> do<00:02:07.829> need<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.039> do<00:02:08.369> some<00:02:08.640> adjusting<00:02:09.209> in<00:02:09.420> the

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
knew do need to do some adjusting in the

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.050 
knew do need to do some adjusting in the
towel<00:02:09.720> we<00:02:09.929> can<00:02:10.080> do<00:02:10.259> so<00:02:10.530> like

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
towel we can do so like

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.880 
towel we can do so like
for<00:02:11.209> instance<00:02:11.480> I<00:02:11.690> could<00:02:11.750> say<00:02:12.050> stretch<00:02:12.470> to<00:02:12.680> fit

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
for instance I could say stretch to fit

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.940 
for instance I could say stretch to fit
goes<00:02:13.730> across<00:02:14.060> makes<00:02:14.690> it<00:02:14.900> all<00:02:15.020> complete<00:02:15.290> or<00:02:15.830> I

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
goes across makes it all complete or I

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.460 
goes across makes it all complete or I
could<00:02:16.310> just<00:02:16.520> put<00:02:17.209> it<00:02:17.360> in<00:02:17.450> here<00:02:17.690> to<00:02:17.870> what<00:02:18.020> I<00:02:18.050> want

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
could just put it in here to what I want

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.190 
could just put it in here to what I want
it<00:02:18.650> to<00:02:18.680> be<00:02:18.770> maybe<00:02:19.130> a<00:02:19.250> 60<00:02:19.819> by<00:02:20.030> six<00:02:20.569> or<00:02:20.720> something

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
it to be maybe a 60 by six or something

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.470 
it to be maybe a 60 by six or something
you<00:02:22.069> know<00:02:22.099> we<00:02:22.340> can<00:02:22.489> adjust<00:02:22.910> it<00:02:23.120> make<00:02:23.360> it

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
you know we can adjust it make it

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.760 
you know we can adjust it make it
whatever<00:02:23.660> it<00:02:23.900> needs<00:02:24.020> I'm<00:02:24.290> just<00:02:24.440> going<00:02:24.590> to<00:02:24.650> say

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
whatever it needs I'm just going to say

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.979 
whatever it needs I'm just going to say
stretch<00:02:25.069> to<00:02:25.280> fit<00:02:25.430> for<00:02:25.700> giggles<00:02:26.209> so<00:02:26.420> we<00:02:26.599> can<00:02:26.780> see

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
stretch to fit for giggles so we can see

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.780 
stretch to fit for giggles so we can see
there's<00:02:27.290> definitely<00:02:27.769> two<00:02:28.069> different<00:02:28.099> tiles

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
there's definitely two different tiles

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.660 
there's definitely two different tiles
now<00:02:29.690> we<00:02:29.750> need<00:02:30.050> this<00:02:30.170> proper<00:02:30.950> square<00:02:31.250> footage

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
now we need this proper square footage

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.610 
now we need this proper square footage
for<00:02:31.700> this<00:02:32.030> so<00:02:32.209> we<00:02:32.360> can<00:02:32.569> actually<00:02:32.720> build<00:02:33.260> it<00:02:33.500> and

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
for this so we can actually build it and

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.190 
for this so we can actually build it and
buy<00:02:33.860> it<00:02:34.120> okay<00:02:35.120> so<00:02:35.180> let's<00:02:35.900> do<00:02:36.140> that<00:02:36.319> let's<00:02:36.650> go<00:02:36.980> to

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
buy it okay so let's do that let's go to

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.500 
buy it okay so let's do that let's go to
the<00:02:39.200> two-dimensional<00:02:40.040> plan<00:02:40.340> let's<00:02:41.269> go<00:02:41.450> to

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
the two-dimensional plan let's go to

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.750 
the two-dimensional plan let's go to
tools<00:02:41.900> and<00:02:42.319> let's<00:02:42.680> say<00:02:42.980> on<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.310> materials

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
tools and let's say on the materials

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.630 
tools and let's say on the materials
list<00:02:43.790> let's<00:02:44.299> calculate<00:02:44.630> from<00:02:45.019> all<00:02:45.230> floors<00:02:45.640> and

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
list let's calculate from all floors and

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.309 
list let's calculate from all floors and
I'm<00:02:46.730> going<00:02:46.910> to<00:02:46.970> stretch<00:02:47.360> this<00:02:47.660> little<00:02:48.080> data

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
I'm going to stretch this little data

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.530 
I'm going to stretch this little data
sheet<00:02:48.709> that<00:02:48.920> it's<00:02:49.069> created<00:02:49.610> for<00:02:49.880> us<00:02:49.910> out<00:02:50.239> here

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
sheet that it's created for us out here

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.300 
sheet that it's created for us out here
so<00:02:50.810> we<00:02:50.930> can<00:02:50.989> kind<00:02:51.319> of<00:02:51.500> see<00:02:51.709> what's<00:02:51.890> going<00:02:52.190> on

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
so we can kind of see what's going on

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.270 
so we can kind of see what's going on
and<00:02:52.610> here's<00:02:53.390> our<00:02:53.569> dealt<00:02:53.930> I'll<00:02:54.200> one<00:02:54.620> by<00:02:54.799> one<00:02:55.069> by

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
and here's our dealt I'll one by one by

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.970 
and here's our dealt I'll one by one by
one<00:02:55.519> one<00:02:56.060> inch<00:02:56.269> by<00:02:56.599> one<00:02:56.630> inch<00:02:56.840> by<00:02:57.290> one<00:02:57.319> inch<00:02:57.530> and

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
one one inch by one inch by one inch and

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.600 
one one inch by one inch by one inch and
there's<00:02:58.549> over<00:02:58.760> 5,600<00:02:59.690> of<00:03:00.200> these<00:03:00.349> bad<00:03:00.650> boys<00:03:00.950> now

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
there's over 5,600 of these bad boys now

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.190 
there's over 5,600 of these bad boys now
if<00:03:01.670> I<00:03:01.790> were<00:03:01.910> to<00:03:02.000> type<00:03:02.180> it<00:03:02.390> in<00:03:02.569> because<00:03:02.959> I<00:03:03.140> know

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
if I were to type it in because I know

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.410 
if I were to type it in because I know
it's<00:03:03.500> a<00:03:03.590> dollar<00:03:03.799> twenty<00:03:04.160> square<00:03:04.760> foot<00:03:05.180> let's

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
it's a dollar twenty square foot let's

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.449 
it's a dollar twenty square foot let's
say<00:03:05.690> it<00:03:06.200> would<00:03:06.380> give<00:03:06.500> me<00:03:06.530> this<00:03:06.739> ridiculous

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
say it would give me this ridiculous

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.400 
say it would give me this ridiculous
price<00:03:07.760> and<00:03:08.030> that's<00:03:08.090> because<00:03:08.360> it's<00:03:08.720> only<00:03:08.989> doing

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
price and that's because it's only doing

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.160 
price and that's because it's only doing
again<00:03:09.680> one<00:03:10.069> inch<00:03:10.340> by<00:03:10.610> one<00:03:10.640> inch<00:03:10.910> so<00:03:11.810> we<00:03:11.930> have<00:03:12.019> to

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
again one inch by one inch so we have to

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.199 
again one inch by one inch so we have to
explain<00:03:12.739> to<00:03:12.799> chief<00:03:13.310> that<00:03:13.670> we<00:03:13.819> want<00:03:14.060> this

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
explain to chief that we want this

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.259 
explain to chief that we want this
material<00:03:14.720> to<00:03:14.810> calculate<00:03:15.380> per<00:03:15.680> square<00:03:16.070> feet<00:03:16.549> so

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
material to calculate per square feet so

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.300 
material to calculate per square feet so
let's<00:03:17.299> do<00:03:17.660> that<00:03:17.690> and<00:03:18.410> click<00:03:18.620> no<00:03:18.890> here<00:03:19.160> because

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
let's do that and click no here because

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.370 
let's do that and click no here because
we<00:03:19.430> don't<00:03:19.609> need<00:03:19.790> that<00:03:20.000> I'm<00:03:20.630> going<00:03:20.780> to<00:03:20.840> go<00:03:21.019> into

we don't need that I'm going to go into

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.210 
we don't need that I'm going to go into
my<00:03:21.980> 3d<00:03:22.850> view<00:03:23.120> here<00:03:23.470> using<00:03:24.470> my<00:03:24.620> rainbow<00:03:24.980> tulle

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.699 
my 3d view here using my rainbow tulle
i'm<00:03:25.370> going<00:03:25.579> to<00:03:25.670> select<00:03:25.940> the<00:03:26.930> tile<00:03:27.200> where<00:03:27.440> i<00:03:27.470> can

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
i'm going to select the tile where i can

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.590 
i'm going to select the tile where i can
manipulate<00:03:27.980> again<00:03:28.670> and<00:03:28.880> let's<00:03:29.269> go<00:03:29.420> to<00:03:29.480> the

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
manipulate again and let's go to the

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.990 
manipulate again and let's go to the
general<00:03:30.049> tab<00:03:30.500> and<00:03:31.130> we<00:03:31.280> want<00:03:31.489> to<00:03:31.579> make<00:03:31.730> these

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
general tab and we want to make these

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.580 
general tab and we want to make these
pieces<00:03:32.630> of<00:03:33.109> 12<00:03:33.440> inch<00:03:33.650> by<00:03:34.160> 12<00:03:34.459> inch<00:03:35.230> will<00:03:36.230> notice

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
pieces of 12 inch by 12 inch will notice

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.400 
pieces of 12 inch by 12 inch will notice
that<00:03:36.620> the<00:03:37.310> square<00:03:37.579> comes<00:03:38.510> up<00:03:38.750> quite<00:03:39.200> a<00:03:39.260> bit

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
that the square comes up quite a bit

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:40.629 
that the square comes up quite a bit
bigger<00:03:39.620> because<00:03:39.889> now<00:03:40.220> it's<00:03:40.400> going<00:03:40.549> to

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:40.639 
bigger because now it's going to

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:43.690 
bigger because now it's going to
calculate<00:03:40.970> 12<00:03:41.480> inches<00:03:41.840> by<00:03:42.049> 12<00:03:42.350> inches<00:03:42.579> well<00:03:43.579> we

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
calculate 12 inches by 12 inches well we

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.309 
calculate 12 inches by 12 inches well we
don't<00:03:43.850> want<00:03:44.030> to<00:03:44.090> see<00:03:44.420> that<00:03:44.450> obviously<00:03:45.019> in<00:03:45.200> the

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
don't want to see that obviously in the

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.229 
don't want to see that obviously in the
3d<00:03:45.650> we<00:03:45.769> want<00:03:45.950> to<00:03:46.040> see<00:03:46.190> it<00:03:46.280> properly<00:03:46.549> and<00:03:47.090> it

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
3d we want to see it properly and it

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.780 
3d we want to see it properly and it
render<00:03:47.690> still<00:03:48.019> in<00:03:48.260> low<00:03:48.470> color<00:03:48.769> which<00:03:49.040> is<00:03:49.069> high

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
render still in low color which is high

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.870 
render still in low color which is high
color<00:03:50.350> correctly<00:03:51.350> but<00:03:51.950> in<00:03:52.100> the<00:03:52.220> pattern<00:03:52.639> it's

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
color correctly but in the pattern it's

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.000 
color correctly but in the pattern it's
too<00:03:53.120> big<00:03:53.389> so<00:03:53.840> if<00:03:53.930> I<00:03:54.049> want<00:03:54.290> to<00:03:54.410> actually<00:03:54.560> change

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
too big so if I want to actually change

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.789 
too big so if I want to actually change
the<00:03:55.130> pattern<00:03:55.639> I<00:03:55.850> can<00:03:56.299> go<00:03:56.450> grab<00:03:56.720> another<00:03:56.799> say

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
the pattern I can go grab another say

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.080 
the pattern I can go grab another say
chief<00:03:58.100> tile<00:03:59.590> and<00:04:00.590> then<00:04:00.980> let's<00:04:01.489> just<00:04:01.790> run

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
chief tile and then let's just run

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.289 
chief tile and then let's just run
through<00:04:02.120> these<00:04:02.630> real<00:04:03.019> quick<00:04:03.670> say<00:04:04.670> this<00:04:05.120> one

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
through these real quick say this one

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:11.470 
through these real quick say this one
right<00:04:05.450> here<00:04:05.510> and<00:04:06.019> set<00:04:06.560> it<00:04:06.680> to<00:04:08.290> 0.05<00:04:09.290> and<00:04:10.480> click

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
right here and set it to 0.05 and click

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.710 
right here and set it to 0.05 and click
ok<00:04:11.870> now<00:04:12.130> it's<00:04:13.130> set<00:04:13.430> nice<00:04:13.700> and<00:04:13.940> small<00:04:14.180> like<00:04:14.600> I

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
ok now it's set nice and small like I

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.330 
ok now it's set nice and small like I
like<00:04:14.930> it<00:04:15.139> but<00:04:15.260> in<00:04:15.410> the<00:04:15.530> general<00:04:15.709> tab<00:04:15.889> it's

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
like it but in the general tab it's

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.340 
like it but in the general tab it's
going<00:04:16.549> to<00:04:16.609> calculate<00:04:16.970> 12<00:04:17.450> inches<00:04:17.780> by<00:04:18.049> 12

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
going to calculate 12 inches by 12

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.520 
going to calculate 12 inches by 12
inches<00:04:18.500> which<00:04:19.070> is<00:04:19.099> perfect<00:04:19.989> okay<00:04:20.989> and<00:04:21.200> it<00:04:21.320> did

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530
