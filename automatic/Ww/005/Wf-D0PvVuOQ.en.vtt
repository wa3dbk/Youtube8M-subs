00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.950
 one interesting test program 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.230
 launched lenovo a760 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.070
 quad qualcomm processor and 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.500
 adreno 203 to test the possibilities 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:28.430
 3d accelerator is such a test 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.430
 visualization check 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.610
 he 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.890
 run benchmark 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:10.990
 I remind you once again that the smartphone is worth China 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:14.910
 only 115 dollars not very 3 nuclear 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:17.980
 qualcomm snapdragon 200 processor 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:22.930
 4 giga memory is built in there is a slot for 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:25.860
 sd micro sd expansion cards 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:32.920
 install up to 32 gigabytes maybe this 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:34.989
 64 he has a rear camera 5 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:40.920
 megapixels its screen resolution 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:45.220
 four and a half inches ips matrix 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.650
 gigabytes of ram game go 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:51.450
 Remarkably low screen resolution 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.450
 so nothing really slows down 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.730
 performance this gpu processor 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.130
 is between inteco processors 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:04.560
 dual core 6577 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:10.110
 and just below is 6589 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:17.380
 with its powerful graphics processor and 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:22.510
 so the test showed 32 fps 32.2 fps on his 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:27.420
 screen resolution of 856 by 480 thanks for 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.420
