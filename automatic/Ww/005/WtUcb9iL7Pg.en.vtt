00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.609 
usually take my book in my purse because
I<00:01:35.880> read<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.150> on<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.329> bus<00:01:36.509> or<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:36.780> read<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.079> on<00:01:37.409> my

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
I read it on the bus or I read it on my

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.440 
I read it on the bus or I read it on my
lunch<00:01:37.770> break<00:01:37.890> at<00:01:38.159> work<00:01:38.310> or<00:01:38.610> wherever

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
lunch break at work or wherever

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.530 
lunch break at work or wherever
um<00:01:40.520> so<00:01:41.520> sometimes<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.939> books<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.270> buy<00:01:42.420> are

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
um so sometimes the books I buy are

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.030 
um so sometimes the books I buy are
really<00:01:42.780> thick<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.200> they<00:01:43.380> don't<00:01:43.530> fit<00:01:43.649> my<00:01:43.799> purse

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
really thick and they don't fit my purse

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.980 
really thick and they don't fit my purse
so<00:01:44.280> then<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.460> think<00:01:44.670> well<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.360> guess<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.840> can<00:01:45.960> just

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
so then I think well I guess I can just

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.749 
so then I think well I guess I can just
only<00:01:46.380> read<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.649> at<00:01:46.740> home<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.159> end<00:01:47.340> up<00:01:47.490> taking

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
only read it at home and end up taking

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.550 
only read it at home and end up taking
forever<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.810> get<00:01:48.899> through<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.110> book<00:01:49.290> just

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
forever to get through a book just

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.080 
forever to get through a book just
because<00:01:49.680> it's<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.070> inconvenient<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.700> carry<00:01:50.939> it

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
because it's so inconvenient to carry it

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.649 
because it's so inconvenient to carry it
around<00:01:51.409> um<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.770> actually<00:01:53.070> this<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.850> got<00:01:54.509> this

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
around um and actually this I got this

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.510 
around um and actually this I got this
eReader<00:01:55.110> actually<00:01:55.560> only<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.799> few<00:01:55.950> days<00:01:56.070> ago<00:01:56.280> and

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
eReader actually only a few days ago and

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.620 
eReader actually only a few days ago and
I'm<00:01:56.640> obsessed<00:01:57.210> with<00:01:57.270> it

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
I'm obsessed with it

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.260 
I'm obsessed with it
but<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.590> went<00:01:59.100> into<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.549> store<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.909> get<00:02:00.030> some

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
but I went into the store to get some

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.780 
but I went into the store to get some
books<00:02:00.829> because<00:02:01.829> I<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:01.950> need<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.369> stock<00:02:02.579> up<00:02:02.610> on

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
books because I I need to stock up on

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.399 
books because I I need to stock up on
books<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.509> didn't<00:02:03.719> have<00:02:03.899> anything<00:02:04.110> left

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
books that I didn't have anything left

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.570 
books that I didn't have anything left
to<00:02:04.530> read<00:02:04.740> so<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.340> had<00:02:05.490> two<00:02:05.700> books<00:02:05.880> in<00:02:05.939> my<00:02:06.060> hand

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
to read so I had two books in my hand

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.030 
to read so I had two books in my hand
never<00:02:06.700> like<00:02:06.940> $40<00:02:07.750> from<00:02:07.870> two<00:02:08.050> bucks<00:02:08.290> and<00:02:08.530> then<00:02:09.009> I

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.040 
never like $40 from two bucks and then I

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.210 
never like $40 from two bucks and then I
walked<00:02:09.310> by<00:02:09.430> the<00:02:09.490> little<00:02:09.820> Kobo<00:02:11.070> station<00:02:12.070> where

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
walked by the little Kobo station where

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.100 
walked by the little Kobo station where
they<00:02:12.310> had<00:02:12.460> all<00:02:12.700> these<00:02:12.850> setup<00:02:13.270> and<00:02:13.480> they<00:02:14.020> were

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
they had all these setup and they were

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.430 
they had all these setup and they were
$99<00:02:15.070> so<00:02:15.610> I<00:02:15.640> was<00:02:15.910> thinking<00:02:16.270> okay<00:02:16.390> so<00:02:16.600> if<00:02:17.020> I<00:02:17.140> spent

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
$99 so I was thinking okay so if I spent

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.220 
$99 so I was thinking okay so if I spent
$60<00:02:18.070> more<00:02:18.310> I<00:02:18.700> can<00:02:19.330> get<00:02:19.450> this<00:02:19.570> device<00:02:19.960> and<00:02:20.140> I'm

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
$60 more I can get this device and I'm

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.570 
$60 more I can get this device and I'm
never<00:02:20.410> gonna<00:02:20.530> have<00:02:20.770> to<00:02:20.800> buy<00:02:21.040> a<00:02:21.070> book<00:02:21.340> in<00:02:21.490> the

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
never gonna have to buy a book in the

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.660 
never gonna have to buy a book in the
store<00:02:21.790> again<00:02:21.880> and<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.660> books<00:02:22.870> are<00:02:23.670> cheaper

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
store again and the books are cheaper

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.150 
store again and the books are cheaper
when<00:02:24.850> you<00:02:24.970> buy<00:02:25.120> them<00:02:25.360> in<00:02:25.420> an<00:02:25.720> e-book<00:02:25.900> some<00:02:26.860> are

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
when you buy them in an e-book some are

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.550 
when you buy them in an e-book some are
not<00:02:27.430> as<00:02:27.610> cheap<00:02:28.030> but<00:02:28.240> like<00:02:28.360> for<00:02:29.140> example<00:02:29.500> I

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
not as cheap but like for example I

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.340 
not as cheap but like for example I
think<00:02:29.650> one<00:02:30.370> of<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.520> books<00:02:30.700> I<00:02:30.850> got<00:02:31.000> was<00:02:31.210> like

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
think one of the books I got was like

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.430 
think one of the books I got was like
1899<00:02:32.350> and<00:02:32.620> then<00:02:32.710> on<00:02:32.800> the<00:02:32.920> Cobos<00:02:33.250> only<00:02:33.730> $11.99

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
1899 and then on the Cobos only $11.99

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.200 
1899 and then on the Cobos only $11.99
so<00:02:35.440> if<00:02:35.770> you<00:02:35.890> do<00:02:36.160> get<00:02:36.490> one<00:02:36.670> of<00:02:36.760> these<00:02:36.820> eventually

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
so if you do get one of these eventually

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.840 
so if you do get one of these eventually
it<00:02:37.480> will<00:02:37.540> pay<00:02:37.720> for<00:02:37.750> itself<00:02:37.960> um<00:02:38.950> and<00:02:39.460> I<00:02:39.670> thought

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
it will pay for itself um and I thought

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.210 
it will pay for itself um and I thought
I<00:02:39.910> won't<00:02:40.060> like<00:02:40.240> it<00:02:40.270> at<00:02:40.660> first<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:41.320> first<00:02:41.830> maybe

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
I won't like it at first the first maybe

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.000 
I won't like it at first the first maybe
couple<00:02:42.610> hours<00:02:42.820> I<00:02:42.940> had<00:02:43.120> it<00:02:43.300> I<00:02:43.420> was<00:02:43.540> like<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:44.680> don't
