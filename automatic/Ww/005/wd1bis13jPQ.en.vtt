here and here you can place a redstone
block<00:05:29.190> and<00:05:29.820> they<00:05:31.220> blue<00:05:32.220> stained<00:05:32.550> clay<00:05:32.880> maybe

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
block and they blue stained clay maybe

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.969 
block and they blue stained clay maybe
or<00:05:33.510> lapis<00:05:34.380> lazuli

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 
I think that's here I'm going to use the

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:42.710 
I think that's here I'm going to use the
lava<00:05:36.600> to<00:05:36.900> the<00:05:37.050> lapis<00:05:37.380> lazuli<00:05:40.580> yeah<00:05:41.580> that<00:05:42.479> will

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
lava to the lapis lazuli yeah that will

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.969 
lava to the lapis lazuli yeah that will
do<00:05:43.410> it<00:05:43.530> pretty<00:05:43.889> much<00:05:44.810> and<00:05:45.810> we<00:05:46.470> are<00:05:46.590> basically
