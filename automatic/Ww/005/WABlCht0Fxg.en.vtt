shade has been kind of stuck I mean ah
these<00:00:24.359> it's<00:00:25.320> not<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.590> matter<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:26.010> just

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
these it's not a matter of just

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.060 
these it's not a matter of just
restringing<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.090> mean<00:00:27.570> these<00:00:27.800> strings<00:00:28.800> are

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
restringing it I mean these strings are

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.530 
restringing it I mean these strings are
starting<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.820> shred<00:00:30.980> but<00:00:31.980> also<00:00:32.250> if<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.360> can

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
starting to shred but also if you can

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.110 
starting to shred but also if you can
see<00:00:33.570> right<00:00:34.020> here<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.680> fabric<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.520> shredding

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
see right here the fabric is shredding

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.630 
see right here the fabric is shredding
maybe<00:00:36.960> because<00:00:37.410> this<00:00:37.559> is<00:00:37.770> like<00:00:37.950> 10<00:00:38.190> years<00:00:38.399> old

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
maybe because this is like 10 years old

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.130 
maybe because this is like 10 years old
and<00:00:38.910> it's<00:00:39.090> just<00:00:39.270> getting<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.719> little<00:00:39.809> son

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
and it's just getting a little son

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.069 
and it's just getting a little son
rotted<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.340> strings<00:00:41.820> are<00:00:42.030> going<00:00:42.059> off<00:00:42.420> in

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
rotted and the strings are going off in

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.950 
rotted and the strings are going off in
that<00:00:43.680> direction<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.610> even<00:00:45.539> if<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.780> was

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
that direction so even if it was

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.260 
that direction so even if it was
restrung<00:00:46.680> um<00:00:48.020> ain't<00:00:49.020> gonna<00:00:49.280> hold<00:00:50.280> so<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:50.940> got<00:00:51.239> a

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
this these side clamps okay there's a

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.950 
this these side clamps okay there's a
string<00:01:26.850> holder<00:01:27.330> ah<00:01:29.360> the<00:01:30.360> one<00:01:30.570> that's<00:01:30.780> already

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
string holder ah the one that's already

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.340 
string holder ah the one that's already
up<00:01:31.409> here<00:01:31.920> looks<00:01:32.820> like<00:01:32.909> it's<00:01:33.210> bolted<00:01:33.750> directly

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
up here looks like it's bolted directly

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.609 
up here looks like it's bolted directly
up<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.060> top<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.540> cabinets<00:01:37.170> under<00:01:37.500> the

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
up to the top of the cabinets under the

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.950 
up to the top of the cabinets under the
valance<00:01:38.159> okay<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:38.549> may<00:01:39.119> not<00:01:39.360> be<00:01:39.540> as<00:01:39.689> difficult

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
valance okay so may not be as difficult

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.399 
valance okay so may not be as difficult
as<00:01:40.439> I'm<00:01:40.619> imagining<00:01:41.100> maybe<00:01:41.850> I'm<00:01:42.259> letting<00:01:43.259> my

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
as I'm imagining maybe I'm letting my

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.740 
as I'm imagining maybe I'm letting my
imagination<00:01:43.619> run<00:01:44.130> away<00:01:44.280> with<00:01:44.640> me<00:01:44.820> but<00:01:45.630> the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
imagination run away with me but the

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.510 
imagination run away with me but the
side<00:01:45.960> brackets<00:01:46.290> look<00:01:46.649> like<00:01:46.829> okay<00:01:47.369> they're

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
side brackets look like okay they're

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
side brackets look like okay they're
actually<00:01:47.909> top<00:01:48.210> brackets<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:49.020> they<00:01:49.170> might<00:01:49.470> be

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
actually top brackets so they might be

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.810 
actually top brackets so they might be
not<00:01:51.540> too<00:01:51.780> hard<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.110> install<00:01:52.680> with<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.460> need<00:01:53.579> to

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
not too hard to install with I need to

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.030 
not too hard to install with I need to
get<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.090> drill<00:01:54.360> out<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.229> screwdrivers

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040

shades were put up with some pretty long

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.410 
shades were put up with some pretty long
screws<00:02:26.290> those<00:02:27.280> are<00:02:27.460> the<00:02:27.550> type<00:02:27.760> you<00:02:27.910> drive<00:02:28.210> in

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
screws those are the type you drive in

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.720 
screws those are the type you drive in
with<00:02:28.600> a<00:02:29.340> drill

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
with a drill

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.630 
with a drill
I<00:02:31.050> wish<00:02:32.050> I'll<00:02:32.230> carry<00:02:32.530> on<00:02:32.740> here<00:02:33.130> yeah<00:02:33.280> maybe<00:02:33.550> I

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
I wish I'll carry on here yeah maybe I

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.940 
I wish I'll carry on here yeah maybe I
should<00:02:33.940> have<00:02:34.060> done<00:02:35.250> done<00:02:36.250> these<00:02:36.750> first<00:02:37.950> we'll

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
should have done done these first we'll

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.980 
should have done done these first we'll
get<00:02:39.130> them<00:02:39.250> now<00:02:39.460> though<00:02:39.700> so<00:02:40.450> I'll<00:02:40.510> have<00:02:40.750> to<00:02:40.870> get

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
get them now though so I'll have to get

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.380 
get them now though so I'll have to get
these<00:02:41.200> um<00:02:43.020> new<00:02:44.020> brackets<00:02:44.830> centered<00:02:45.760> I<00:02:46.090> guess

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
these um new brackets centered I guess

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.560 
these um new brackets centered I guess
just<00:02:46.420> right<00:02:46.990> I<00:02:47.020> guess<00:02:47.380> I'm<00:02:48.060> because<00:02:49.060> they're

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
just right I guess I'm because they're

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.140 
just right I guess I'm because they're
gonna<00:02:49.720> have<00:02:49.810> to<00:02:49.900> fit<00:02:50.230> in<00:02:50.380> between<00:02:50.560> this

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
gonna have to fit in between this

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.490 
gonna have to fit in between this
channel<00:02:52.680> of<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.950> valance<00:02:54.520> right<00:02:54.940> so<00:02:55.150> this<00:02:55.300> is

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
channel of the valance right so this is

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.130 
channel of the valance right so this is
mount<00:02:56.500> brackets<00:02:57.360> approximately<00:02:58.360> three

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
mount brackets approximately three

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.800 
mount brackets approximately three
inches<00:02:59.500> in<00:02:59.770> from<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.190> corner<00:03:00.460> of<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.510> window

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
inches in from the corner of the window

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.980 
inches in from the corner of the window
frame<00:03:02.080> and<00:03:02.910> I'm<00:03:03.910> going<00:03:04.030> to<00:03:04.060> have<00:03:04.330> to<00:03:04.510> also<00:03:04.690> take

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
frame and I'm going to have to also take

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.940 
frame and I'm going to have to also take
care<00:03:05.680> that<00:03:06.360> you<00:03:07.360> know<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.780> front<00:03:08.080> and<00:03:08.290> back

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
care that you know the front and back

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.350 
care that you know the front and back
edges<00:03:09.610> of<00:03:09.790> these<00:03:10.260> brackets<00:03:11.260> are<00:03:11.620> also<00:03:12.400> exactly

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
edges of these brackets are also exactly

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.930 
edges of these brackets are also exactly
lined<00:03:13.990> up<00:03:14.290> so<00:03:14.650> that<00:03:14.860> the<00:03:15.010> shade<00:03:15.220> doesn't<00:03:15.640> go<00:03:15.730> in

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
lined up so that the shade doesn't go in

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.940 
lined up so that the shade doesn't go in
crooked<00:03:16.600> because<00:03:16.960> it<00:03:17.080> probably<00:03:17.260> won't<00:03:17.560> go<00:03:17.770> in

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
crooked because it probably won't go in

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.220 
crooked because it probably won't go in
if<00:03:18.070> it's<00:03:18.250> crooked<00:03:18.520> alright<00:03:19.270> alright<00:03:19.840> so<00:03:20.080> this

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
if it's crooked alright alright so this

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.930 
if it's crooked alright alright so this
is<00:03:20.440> about<00:03:20.739> how<00:03:21.160> much<00:03:21.430> room<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.950> shade<00:03:24.250> has<00:03:24.580> on

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
is about how much room the shade has on

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.729 
is about how much room the shade has on
either<00:03:25.209> side<00:03:25.690> of<00:03:25.720> that<00:03:26.459> channel<00:03:27.459> and<00:03:28.739> it's

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
either side of that channel and it's

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.940 
either side of that channel and it's
maybe<00:03:30.010> not<00:03:30.550> even<00:03:31.150> maybe<00:03:31.540> half<00:03:31.900> an<00:03:32.050> inch<00:03:32.260> on

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
maybe not even maybe half an inch on

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.140 
maybe not even maybe half an inch on
each<00:03:33.220> side<00:03:33.250> so<00:03:34.890> I'm<00:03:35.890> not<00:03:36.100> sure<00:03:36.340> what<00:03:36.640> why<00:03:36.970> I'm

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
each side so I'm not sure what why I'm

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.320 
each side so I'm not sure what why I'm
doing<00:03:37.480> this<00:03:37.630> but<00:03:38.610> all<00:03:39.610> right<00:03:39.850> we'll<00:03:40.120> figure

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
doing this but all right we'll figure

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.229 
doing this but all right we'll figure
all<00:03:40.840> right<00:03:41.140> let's<00:03:41.440> uh<00:03:41.739> get<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:42.459> brackets<00:03:42.940> this

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
all right let's uh get the brackets this

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.199 
all right let's uh get the brackets this
is<00:03:43.450> gonna<00:03:43.630> be<00:03:44.320> a<00:03:44.590> two-handed<00:03:45.550> job<00:03:45.820> so<00:03:46.150> I'm

channel of these brackets is proving to

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.990 
channel of these brackets is proving to
be<00:04:50.480> a<00:04:50.900> trick<00:04:51.230> because<00:04:51.800> basically<00:04:52.130> my<00:04:52.670> hands

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
be a trick because basically my hands

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.050 
be a trick because basically my hands
are<00:04:53.120> being<00:04:53.270> blocked<00:04:53.660> by<00:04:54.670> novellas<00:04:55.670> so<00:04:56.000> you

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
are being blocked by novellas so you

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.450 
are being blocked by novellas so you
can't<00:04:56.480> really<00:04:57.490> get<00:04:58.490> before<00:04:59.030> or<00:04:59.300> after<00:04:59.900> it<00:05:00.460> so

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
can't really get before or after it so

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.860 
can't really get before or after it so
this<00:05:01.700> may<00:05:01.940> take<00:05:02.210> an<00:05:02.650> hour<00:05:03.650> or<00:05:04.190> so<00:05:04.610> to<00:05:05.000> get<00:05:05.720> it

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
this may take an hour or so to get it

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.020 
this may take an hour or so to get it
clamped<00:05:06.380> into<00:05:06.530> them<00:05:06.800> so<00:05:07.100> it's<00:05:07.400> like<00:05:07.460> I<00:05:07.670> can't

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
clamped into them so it's like I can't

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:13.030 
clamped into them so it's like I can't
take<00:05:08.360> this<00:05:08.600> off<00:05:08.870> really<00:05:10.150> because<00:05:11.320> where<00:05:12.320> the

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
take this off really because where the

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.190 
take this off really because where the
brackets<00:05:13.490> are<00:05:13.700> screwed<00:05:14.030> in<00:05:14.210> are<00:05:14.390> part<00:05:14.750> of<00:05:14.930> the

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
brackets are screwed in are part of the

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.970 
brackets are screwed in are part of the
balance<00:05:16.070> and<00:05:16.790> I<00:05:16.880> suppose<00:05:17.210> you<00:05:17.600> take<00:05:18.530> out<00:05:18.710> you

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:18.980 
balance and I suppose you take out you

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.920 
balance and I suppose you take out you
this<00:05:19.130> is<00:05:19.280> like<00:05:19.490> a<00:05:19.520> two-person<00:05:20.060> job<00:05:20.270> I'm<00:05:20.690> trying

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
to do it single-handedly oh I can't it's

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.880 
to do it single-handedly oh I can't it's
not<00:05:27.620> quite<00:05:28.220> happening<00:05:29.290> getting<00:05:30.290> this<00:05:30.470> front

reason<00:07:05.810> why<00:07:05.900> the<00:07:05.930> other<00:07:06.080> one<00:07:06.410> got<00:07:06.530> wrecked

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:06.860 
reason why the other one got wrecked

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.650 
reason why the other one got wrecked
partly<00:07:07.400> was<00:07:07.550> because<00:07:07.940> the<00:07:08.180> table<00:07:08.630> was

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:08.660 
partly was because the table was

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.630 
partly was because the table was
permanently<00:07:09.350> bolted<00:07:09.920> to<00:07:10.040> the<00:07:10.160> floor<00:07:10.310> before

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:10.640 
permanently bolted to the floor before

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.890 
permanently bolted to the floor before
now<00:07:11.030> I've<00:07:11.240> you<00:07:12.080> know<00:07:12.110> made<00:07:12.500> my<00:07:13.900> independent

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:14.900 
now I've you know made my independent

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.230 
now I've you know made my independent
table<00:07:15.290> stand<00:07:15.590> there<00:07:15.860> and<00:07:16.070> you<00:07:16.580> were<00:07:16.700> having<00:07:16.910> to

table stand there and you were having to

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.690 
table stand there and you were having to
kind<00:07:17.450> of<00:07:17.600> like<00:07:17.810> reach<00:07:18.080> try<00:07:18.860> reaching<00:07:19.340> over<00:07:19.670> a

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:19.700 
kind of like reach try reaching over a

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.470 
kind of like reach try reaching over a
table<00:07:20.120> and<00:07:20.660> then<00:07:21.230> try<00:07:21.590> lifting<00:07:22.490> a<00:07:22.880> shade<00:07:23.150> with

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:23.480 
table and then try lifting a shade with

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.050 
table and then try lifting a shade with
the<00:07:23.510> you<00:07:24.020> know<00:07:24.050> two<00:07:24.200> hands<00:07:24.920> reaching<00:07:25.580> over<00:07:26.030> a

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:26.060 
the you know two hands reaching over a

table and that just made it like pulling
from<00:07:32.570> side<00:07:32.810> to<00:07:32.840> side<00:07:32.990> uneven<00:07:33.740> you<00:07:33.860> can<00:07:34.040> hardly

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:34.280 
from side to side uneven you can hardly

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.450 
from side to side uneven you can hardly
help<00:07:34.520> that<00:07:34.880> and<00:07:35.180> it<00:07:35.900> caused<00:07:36.470> it<00:07:36.770> in<00:07:36.920> our<00:07:37.160> chair

help that and it caused it in our chair
a<00:07:37.490> nice<00:07:37.970> because<00:07:38.330> you<00:07:38.510> do<00:07:38.660> get<00:07:38.900> a<00:07:39.140> good<00:07:39.440> view

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:39.890

now it's kind of shadowy and then the

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:49.270 
now it's kind of shadowy and then the
the<00:07:45.290> the<00:07:45.560> night<00:07:46.040> part<00:07:46.430> really<00:07:46.700> does<00:07:48.280> really

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:49.280 
the the night part really does really

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:53.020 
the the night part really does really
block<00:07:49.970> out<00:07:50.240> the<00:07:50.450> Sun<00:07:50.720> and<00:07:51.020> the<00:07:51.290> heat<00:07:51.560> and<00:07:52.040> gives
