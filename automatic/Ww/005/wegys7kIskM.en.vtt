 experienced teachers who teach 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.929
 individual as for times 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.120
 need not stay still be part of 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.620
 you also of our initiative and hope 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.480
 the winner everest the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.660
 universe of Brazil 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.879
 i say nepal to the world the greatest everest 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.280
 mountain of the world every year miscellaneous 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.140
 climbers die trying to climb up the 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.180
 everest is the biggest challenge for any 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.160
 one who wants to venture into the planet 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.180
 land and many risk their lives to 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.550
 conquer the 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.309
 one of the most inhospitable and dangerous 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.469
 of planet earth one in 12 climbers 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.600
 dies up there and their bodies are 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.700
 left there for ever 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.280
 because a ransom is a corpse can 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.560
 end up risking more lives still there in the 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.540
 There is a cemetery called Vale do 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.930
 rainbow if you have a strong stomach 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.880
 can you type in google rainbow valley 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.729
 everest and good luck the most interesting 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.650
 is that a phenomenon called cost 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.750
 and irrecoverable with the climbers who 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.299
 even though they know the dangers they end up 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.920
 risking and dying or leaving 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.659
 your own friends die many 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.119
 die after reaching the top of the 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.860
 everest and on the return they end up falling 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.840
 by exhaustion what goes through the head 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.939
 of these climbers must be a feeling 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.040
 ball 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.720
 I got here are almost on top of the 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.030
 highest mountain in the world I can not 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.220
 return and as their last breath they 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.409
 conquer mountain and soon after tom 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.790
 Well, spending eternity on the deck. 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.860
 Have you both dreamed of arriving? 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.110
 Good, you must be trying to make a 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.060
 between you and these mountain climbers. 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.009
 it should not be difficult if 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.420
 find in the same position as them but 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.250
 I think you two have a lot in 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.680
 common and that's why I'll go over 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.079
 a more realistic example for you 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.979
 imagine that you met a girl 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.629
 wonderful you got one 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.940
 relationship with her is being 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.750
 extremely happy but hangman time 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.220
 You always start breaking them down. 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.050
 relationship with time that 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.820
 wonderful relationship you had 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.620
 for a couple of years has now become a 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.420
 Hell just is not one iota 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.640
 happy can not stand being in the same 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.260
 routine but what prevents you from separating 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.100
 She said that her life will seek what 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.990
 makes you happy 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.000
 maybe it's the time itself you know 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.340
 cares about her and is afraid that she will 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.230
 alone or you are afraid to stay 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.630
 just too lazy to look for a person 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.790
 new or maybe all these things together 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.250
 So you think I've already spent two 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.900
 years with her I can not end now I 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.120
 I have to continue as the 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.680
 climbers dying on top of everest 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.390
 Do you also prefer to continue a 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.060
 bad relationship not to leave as 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.459
 defeated but you are already defeated a 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.410
 honor and pride and die after climbing the 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.870
 everest top and keep a 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.880
 relationship for love that causes 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.650
 both you and your wife suffered 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.780
 I know it's hard but you still have to 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.489
 be wondering rock from us and 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.750
 video or you are traveling in 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.090
 mayonnaise only good 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.680
 the answer to that question is yes it is 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.600
 LÃ³ and now we go to our losin 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.910
 fritz must have seen that video already 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.570
 viral I love league of legends but I hate it 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.400
 play it 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.010
 he is a perfect example of a course 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.930
 recoverable when you deposit both 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.700
 time so you want to improve and make 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.350
 with which this time is well spent and 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.930
 when you get a good level of 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.970
 game or medium so to speak you 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.250
 ends up being bound to the game because 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.049
 I'll stop now I've spent so much 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.519
 Time in this game, your pair, now I'm going. 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.320
 have lost all my time I'm going to play 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.700
 everything was all that time that I 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.350
 I spent learning and watching the videos of 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.660
 lab will be thrown in the trash 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.269
 stop playing is like leaving as a 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.860
 defeated and right knows it too well 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.510
 so they make us have to 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.160
 invest so much time on the spot 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.079
 forming dp or lp 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.579
 when we get level 30 it's already difficult 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:55.750
 stop playing it because we want to 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:57.280
 always more and more 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.560
 this makes us keep playing 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.430
 even when we could the game we arrived 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.040
 to play 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.079
 we've had no patience, we 've had everybody 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.239
 we get nervous and it 's not like that and we do not 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.410
 accept to lose more matches because this 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.120
 It makes us have to play 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.799
 more matches to recover what 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.540
 we lost and when we are 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:15.040
 winning we think I've already won two 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.200
 games are best left to play 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.150
 tomorrow but when we start losing 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.560
 we can lose ten straight games 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.240
 that we will continue to play because the 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.250
 People want to leave with a victory in the day and 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.780
 why does this happen to art because 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.760
 people stop playing when they win two 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.800
 matches but not when 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.570
 lose 10 this happens because of a 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.700
 psychological effect I've ever written a 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.070
 video not sabotaging your part of the 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.470
 pac 2 we are the most inclined to notice 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.150
 losses rather than earnings 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.130
 it's easier for us to fall in love with 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.200
 someone who does not pay attention to us 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.910
 someone who gives because what we have in hand 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.840
 not as interesting as not 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.030
 we can achieve 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.440
 then our position is more inclined a 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.600
 relationship that will make us suffer 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.310
 than it would be right because when 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.020
 we are losing we accept one 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.450
 more aggressive posture 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.920
 we accept to lose more and more and more 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.240
 and when we are winning we 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.310
 we end up accepting a more 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.560
 a defensive position where we win 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.050
 two matches and we're already afraid of losing 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.090
 and leaving the negative is in the negative does 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.890
 with which we play more and more and be 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.170
 on the positive makes us play less 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.060
 that we are more closed in relation to 

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.160
 our own choices so it is 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.750
 in bad relationship is much more 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.820
 easy than it is in good relationship 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.890
 because we do not accept to leave underneath and 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.840
 we end up doing it because we do not accept it 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.150
 come out from underneath and turn a blind eye 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.910
 for terrible things and according to the time 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.160
 happens our vision only gets darker and 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.840
 more the same works on love if you 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.030
 won ten matches you probably 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.980
 will not play any more because it has 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.660
 Fear of losing and being frustrated but if you 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.670
 already frustrating you want to play 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.590
 more and more to recover what you lost 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.060
 but if you are in a good phase and avoid 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.040
 play and this causes you not to 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.290
 enjoy your inspiration now if you 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.690
 is inspired to lose my 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:55.090
 friend prepare because you lose 10 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.770
 20 matches and win by very few 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.600
 this I use a very basic rule and 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.220
 losing three consecutive matches then 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:03.100
 time to stop playing for today 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.870
 Finally, the unrecoverable courses 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.940
 they are in our day to day and not 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.920
 works only for this they also serve 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.630
 for when you're inside a game 

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.430
 When are you playing the game? 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.750
 new your team is determined to 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.880
 defend the inhibitor 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.740
 sometimes no decision to go forward or 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.350
 not if the team loses the tower of the inhibitor 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.520
 and then tries to fight the enemy at 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.230
 people already asked the tower 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.850
 You can not lose the level now 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:27.250
 People have to hold them here, but if the 

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:29.590
 team loses the fight loses an inhibitor is 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.510
 play even more down with those 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.730
 years of marauding there is trying to steal the 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:35.950
 dragon knows at any cost 

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:38.530
 they die lose the dragon and still 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:41.380
 complaining of the team where that a fight 5 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:43.360
 against 1 it's fair their heads are 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.220
 They already lost a dragon and their life did not 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.470
 has a sense after this loss 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:49.570
 therefore dying there to lose the dragon does not 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.940
 It's so bad, it 's not right and wrong. 

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:53.440
 when the enemy is taking advantage has 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.450
 that minimizing his advantage does not 

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.730
 increase it is sometimes better to lose one 

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:59.710
 inhibitor alone than losing a fight 

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.660
 and an inhibitor at the same time or place 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:04.390
 after losing the tower there is no means 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:06.100
 term or you fight or you do not fight me 

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:07.750
 I have a game that describes this well and I 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.100
 I'll leave the link in the description and I will not 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.110
 I can put him here because he's from 

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.300
 isl finally a match between the two 

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.900
 professional teams category and games 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.790
 game 

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.890
 the elite category was losing the game 

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:19.900
 but if a mega risky decision and 

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:22.210
 make a bequeath of the enemy nexus the team 

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:24.130
 of the range and got distracted with the connect 

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:26.170
 there in the top line while the team 

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:28.300
 Korean won the game by boat this 

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:30.790
 simplifies the recoverable cost very well 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:32.380
 because they risked everything they did not 

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:34.300
 matter of losing the game there anyway 

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.980
 they had already lost it would be worse 

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.420
 for him to try to defend the towers that 

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:39.520
 already being pulled and has a 

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:41.230
 certain defeat than to lose in the backdoor 

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.330
 ugly they were not afraid to risk 

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:44.860
 win the match because of it and is the 

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.720
 that you have to learn to deal with will be 

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.680
 that you are not struggling with costs 

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.330
 irrecoverable 

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.980
 Will not you do something for fear of 

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.640
 leave defeated but is already losing 

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.290
 very 

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.180
 will it be that in the new you do not play 

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:56.530
 Because you already spent so much time 

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.100
 I think if you stop you're going to leave. 

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:58.270
 losing 

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:00.790
 This is an issue that I leave to 

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:02.380
 yourself respond to take advantage of the 

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.880
 recoverable resources because it is well 

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:05.560
 predicted when the enemy will attempt to 

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:08.200
 kill yourself to steal a noise one 

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:10.480
 dragon and if something that can give advantage and 

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.710
 lead to victory and also vice versa 

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.690
 be very careful not to do 

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:15.700
 deliveries of these phases of the game good people 

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:18.930
 until the next video thank you very much 

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.930
 your affection, kisses
