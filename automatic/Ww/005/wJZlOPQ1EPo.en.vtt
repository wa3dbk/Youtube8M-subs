with the thinkpad tablet we've added a

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.370 
with the thinkpad tablet we've added a
lot<00:00:17.580> of<00:00:17.730> business<00:00:18.090> software<00:00:18.330> so<00:00:19.050> what<00:00:19.170> you<00:00:19.230> can

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
kind of see right off the bat actually

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.490 
kind of see right off the bat actually
is<00:00:21.090> user<00:00:21.359> interface<00:00:21.869> with<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.170> lucky

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
is user interface with the lucky

is user interface with the lucky
launcher<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:23.130> looks<00:00:23.279> very<00:00:23.369> similar<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:24.000> what

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
launcher it looks very similar to what

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.050

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
you would see on the k1 however one of

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.700 
you would see on the k1 however one of
the<00:00:27.119> major<00:00:27.330> things<00:00:27.480> we've<00:00:27.900> emphasized<00:00:28.470> here

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
the major things we've emphasized here

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.679 
the major things we've emphasized here
like<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.160> said<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.580> business<00:00:29.910> software<00:00:30.090> so

it to be able to PDF files Excel and so

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.709 
it to be able to PDF files Excel and so
on<00:00:37.579> the<00:00:38.579> other<00:00:38.700> thing<00:00:38.969> that's<00:00:39.120> also<00:00:39.390> important

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
on the other thing that's also important

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.450 
on the other thing that's also important
about<00:00:39.809> this<00:00:39.989> tablet<00:00:40.200> is<00:00:40.590> its<00:00:41.160> kind<00:00:41.370> of

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
about this tablet is its kind of

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.700 
about this tablet is its kind of
optimized<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.420> this<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.780> digital<00:00:42.960> fam<00:00:43.410> and

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
optimized so this is the digital fam and

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.770 
optimized so this is the digital fam and
the<00:00:43.950> benefit<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.489> digital<00:00:44.700> patent<00:00:45.180> versus<00:00:45.510> a

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
the benefit to a digital patent versus a

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.529 
the benefit to a digital patent versus a
just<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.710> standard<00:00:47.129> like<00:00:47.489> stylus<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.300> there's

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
just a standard like stylus is there's

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.760 
just a standard like stylus is there's
actually<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.870> button<00:00:49.170> on<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.410> pen<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:49.739> you

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
actually a button on the pen so you

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.020 
actually a button on the pen so you
don't<00:00:49.950> actually<00:00:50.129> need<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.489> touch<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.850> screen

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
don't actually need to touch the screen

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.630 
don't actually need to touch the screen
and<00:00:51.329> it's<00:00:51.809> very<00:00:52.079> very<00:00:52.199> solid<00:00:52.890> hand<00:00:53.340> write<00:00:53.520> or

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
and it's very very solid hand write or

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.220 
and it's very very solid hand write or
recognition<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.780> can<00:00:54.899> actually<00:00:55.050> see

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
recognition so you can actually see

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.110 
recognition so you can actually see
somebody<00:00:55.680> has<00:00:55.770> already<00:00:55.920> started<00:00:56.309> right<00:00:56.640> it's

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
somebody has already started right it's

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.240 
somebody has already started right it's
very<00:00:57.300> quick<00:00:57.600> very<00:00:57.809> responsive<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.100> is

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
very quick very responsive so this is

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.770 
very quick very responsive so this is
benefit<00:00:59.670> for<00:00:59.850> something<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.210> be<00:01:00.329> able<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.600> take

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
benefit for something to be able to take

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.840 
benefit for something to be able to take
notes<00:01:01.109> we<00:01:01.739> have<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.920> couple<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.370> different<00:01:02.670> apps

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
notes we have a couple of different apps

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.670 
notes we have a couple of different apps
that<00:01:03.270> we're<00:01:03.420> emphasizing<00:01:03.629> on<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.350> device

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
that we're emphasizing on this device

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.580 
that we're emphasizing on this device
one<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.339> my<00:01:05.519> script<00:01:05.880> one<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.420> flex<00:01:06.659> nine<00:01:06.869> flex

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
one is my script one is flex nine flex

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.920 
one is my script one is flex nine flex
nine<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.040> true<00:01:08.250> hand<00:01:08.490> writer<00:01:08.729> recognition<00:01:09.420> so

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
nine is true hand writer recognition so

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.649 
nine is true hand writer recognition so
you<00:01:09.990> can<00:01:10.380> actually<00:01:10.500> see

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.749 

so<00:01:16.229> one<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.530> just<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.799> basic<00:01:16.979> handwriting

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
so one is just a basic handwriting

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.099 
so one is just a basic handwriting
recognition<00:01:17.819> there's<00:01:18.450> my<00:01:18.539> name<00:01:18.719> the<00:01:19.079> other

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:19.109 
recognition there's my name the other

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:20.510 
recognition there's my name the other
actually<00:01:19.560> takes<00:01:19.770> full<00:01:19.950> note<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.429> will

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
actually takes full note so it will

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.249 
actually takes full note so it will
actually<00:01:20.729> do<00:01:20.999> charts<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.659> all<00:01:21.929> sorts<00:01:22.200> of

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
actually do charts and all sorts of

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.770 
actually do charts and all sorts of
other<00:01:22.520> types<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.729> notes<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.450> might<00:01:24.600> take

other types of notes that you might take

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.999 
other types of notes that you might take
in<00:01:24.899> an<00:01:24.990> office<00:01:25.289> meeting<00:01:25.439> or<00:01:25.740> some<00:01:25.890> other

in an office meeting or some other

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.789 
in an office meeting or some other
meeting<00:01:26.750> the<00:01:27.750> other<00:01:27.869> difference<00:01:28.109> here's<00:01:28.530> we

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
meeting the other difference here's we

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.199 
meeting the other difference here's we
have<00:01:28.920> some<00:01:29.100> buttons<00:01:29.399> across<00:01:29.520> at<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.939> bottom

00:01:30.199 --> 00:01:30.209 
have some buttons across at the bottom

so you have the home the back of the

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.059 
so you have the home the back of the
browser<00:01:32.119> those<00:01:33.119> are<00:01:33.299> basically<00:01:33.719> some<00:01:34.069> other

00:01:35.059 --> 00:01:35.069 
browser those are basically some other

browser those are basically some other
features<00:01:35.549> similar<00:01:36.179> to<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.539> k1<00:01:36.899> though<00:01:37.079> we

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
features similar to the k1 though we

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.139 
features similar to the k1 though we
also<00:01:37.380> have<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.859> bar<00:01:38.399> that<00:01:38.429> does<00:01:38.939> a
