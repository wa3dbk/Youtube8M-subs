you're<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.909> camera<00:01:57.270> buff<00:01:57.420> there's<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.659> little

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
you're a camera buff there's a little

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.719 
you're a camera buff there's a little
bit<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.049> difference<00:01:58.380> on<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:59.070> camera<00:01:59.520> side

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
bit of a difference on the camera side

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.340 
bit of a difference on the camera side
so<00:02:00.000> let's<00:02:00.149> take<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.329> look<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.659> power<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:01.020> on<00:02:01.110> and

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
so let's take a look and power it on and

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.810 
so let's take a look and power it on and
you<00:02:01.590> can<00:02:01.710> see<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.979> design<00:02:02.280> here<00:02:02.490> first<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.759> all

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
you can see the design here first of all

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.280 
you can see the design here first of all
and<00:02:02.939> I've<00:02:03.000> got<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.180> galaxy<00:02:03.600> s4<00:02:03.630> here<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.200> can

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
and I've got a galaxy s4 here so you can

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.080 
and I've got a galaxy s4 here so you can
compare<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.710> differences<00:02:05.159> in<00:02:05.310> terms<00:02:05.790> of<00:02:05.939> look

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
compare the differences in terms of look

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.700 
compare the differences in terms of look
and<00:02:06.240> feel<00:02:06.299> obviously<00:02:06.659> physical<00:02:07.259> buttons<00:02:07.560> down

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
and feel obviously physical buttons down

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.529 
and feel obviously physical buttons down
here<00:02:07.770> at<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.069> bottom<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.239> different

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
here at the bottom and the different

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.999 
here at the bottom and the different
look<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:09.810> feel<00:02:09.869> on<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.140> sides<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.619> back<00:02:10.800> it

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
look and feel on the sides and back it

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.410 
look and feel on the sides and back it
definitely<00:02:11.310> has<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.430> more<00:02:11.520> industrial<00:02:11.910> look

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
definitely has a more industrial look

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.520 
definitely has a more industrial look
and<00:02:12.569> feel<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.930> it<00:02:12.959> but

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
and feel to it but

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.230 
and feel to it but
in<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.860> hand<00:02:14.070> and<00:02:14.220> obviously<00:02:14.580> from<00:02:15.150> a

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
in the hand and obviously from a

the Left microUSB charging port still at

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.040 
the Left microUSB charging port still at
the<00:02:21.090> bottom<00:02:21.240> though<00:02:21.420> it's<00:02:21.570> covered<00:02:21.900> with<00:02:22.020> a

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
the bottom though it's covered with a

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.960 
the bottom though it's covered with a
flap<00:02:22.380> camera<00:02:23.100> on<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.340> back<00:02:23.490> and<00:02:23.760> then<00:02:23.850> your

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
flap camera on the back and then your

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.600 
flap camera on the back and then your
3.5<00:02:24.570> millimeter<00:02:25.080> headphone<00:02:25.140> jack<00:02:25.500> up<00:02:26.010> top<00:02:26.370> as

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
3.5 millimeter headphone jack up top as

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.910 
3.5 millimeter headphone jack up top as
well<00:02:27.150> which<00:02:27.270> surprisingly<00:02:27.720> is<00:02:27.960> not<00:02:28.560> covered

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
well which surprisingly is not covered

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:29.810 
well which surprisingly is not covered
so<00:02:29.040> I<00:02:29.160> think<00:02:29.280> that's<00:02:29.490> pretty<00:02:29.700> interesting

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
so I think that's pretty interesting

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.130 
so I think that's pretty interesting
featuring<00:02:30.570> then<00:02:30.660> of<00:02:30.750> course<00:02:30.900> your<00:02:30.990> higher

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
featuring then of course your higher

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.500

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
blaster for watch on so battery back

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.870 
blaster for watch on so battery back
here<00:02:33.780> as<00:02:33.930> well<00:02:34.170> will<00:02:34.350> power<00:02:34.590> it<00:02:34.770> on<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.160> get

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
here as well will power it on and get

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.000 
here as well will power it on and get
started<00:02:36.300> with<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:37.080> Galaxy<00:02:37.440> s4<00:02:37.650> active<00:02:37.770> but

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
started with the Galaxy s4 active but

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.380 
started with the Galaxy s4 active but
you<00:02:38.070> can<00:02:38.190> see<00:02:38.280> design<00:02:38.580> language<00:02:38.970> overall

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
you can see design language overall

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.880 
you can see design language overall
somewhat<00:02:39.840> similar<00:02:40.200> here<00:02:40.470> with<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.680> way<00:02:40.770> the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
somewhat similar here with the way the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.530 
somewhat similar here with the way the
flash<00:02:41.100> looks<00:02:41.490> with<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.760> volume<00:02:42.090> rocker<00:02:42.300> with

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
flash looks with the volume rocker with

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.120 
flash looks with the volume rocker with
a<00:02:42.600> power<00:02:42.780> button<00:02:43.050> and<00:02:43.290> overall<00:02:43.590> port

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
a power button and overall port

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.430
