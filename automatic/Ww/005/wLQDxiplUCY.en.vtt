this little hole there's really nothing
I<00:00:32.579> don't<00:00:33.030> even<00:00:33.090> know<00:00:33.300> why<00:00:33.420> they<00:00:33.450> put<00:00:33.780> this<00:00:33.899> in

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
I don't even know why they put this in

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:34.459 
I don't even know why they put this in
the<00:00:34.140> game

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
the game

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.819 
the game
other<00:00:34.649> than<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.980> glitch<00:00:35.219> but<00:00:35.719> you<00:00:36.719> know<00:00:36.870> who

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
other than the glitch but you know who

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.910 
other than the glitch but you know who
knows<00:00:38.040> maybe<00:00:38.340> they<00:00:38.520> like<00:00:38.730> glitches<00:00:39.710> anyway<00:00:40.710> so

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
knows maybe they like glitches anyway so

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.729 
knows maybe they like glitches anyway so
you<00:00:41.010> jump<00:00:41.250> on<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.460> barrel<00:00:41.840> and<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:43.469> run<00:00:43.710> a

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
you jump on the barrel and you run a

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.340 
you jump on the barrel and you run a
jump<00:00:44.160> onto<00:00:44.550> this<00:00:44.940> wall<00:00:45.300> why<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:45.809> keep<00:00:46.110> tapping

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
jump onto this wall why you keep tapping

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.740 
jump onto this wall why you keep tapping
triangle<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.010> whole<00:00:47.160> time<00:00:47.399> once<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.480> get<00:00:48.629> up

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
triangle the whole time once you get up

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.229 
triangle the whole time once you get up
there<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.200> just<00:00:50.039> move<00:00:50.219> along<00:00:50.340> until<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.030> can

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
there and just move along until you can

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.950 
there and just move along until you can
pop<00:00:52.110> out<00:00:52.340> and<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:53.969> now<00:00:54.149> we're<00:00:54.300> outside<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.629> map

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
pop out and so now we're outside the map

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.369 
pop out and so now we're outside the map
and<00:00:55.640> I'm<00:00:56.640> gonna<00:00:56.789> take<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.210> over<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.629> the

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.630 

all<00:01:27.330> right<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:27.780> now<00:01:27.930> we're<00:01:28.170> here<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:29.009> you'll

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
right here and because of that castle up

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.050 
right here and because of that castle up
top<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.049> just<00:01:34.200> saw<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.520> come<00:01:35.820> over

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
into this little glitch this little wall

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.270 
into this little glitch this little wall
I<00:01:38.880> guess<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.509> wall<00:01:39.690> in<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.899> rock<00:01:40.080> and<00:01:40.470> drop

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
I guess the wall in the rock and drop

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.960 
I guess the wall in the rock and drop
down<00:01:42.259> into<00:01:43.259> some<00:01:43.560> magic<00:01:45.470> then<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.560> got<00:01:46.770> stuck

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
down into some magic then I got stuck

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.889 
down into some magic then I got stuck
let<00:01:47.970> me<00:01:48.060> touch<00:01:48.299> yes<00:01:49.110> anyways<00:01:50.360> this<00:01:51.360> we<00:01:51.690> are

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
let me touch yes anyways this we are

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.020 
let me touch yes anyways this we are
under<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.350> sky<00:01:52.560> for<00:01:52.830> now<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:54.380> this<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:56.030> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
under the sky for now and this is the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.020 
under the sky for now and this is the
sky<00:01:57.240> for<00:01:57.539> two<00:01:57.659> guys<00:01:57.840> inventory<00:01:58.710> which<00:01:59.670> we<00:01:59.850> have

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
sky for two guys inventory which we have

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.999 
sky for two guys inventory which we have
free<00:02:00.479> access<00:02:00.720> to<00:02:01.670> and<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:03.679> you<00:02:04.679> can<00:02:04.830> take

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
free access to and so you can take

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:05.960 
free access to and so you can take
anything<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.429> want

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
anything you want

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.999 
anything you want
you<00:02:06.149> know<00:02:06.300> but<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:07.020> can't<00:02:07.259> be<00:02:07.380> open<00:02:07.649> covered

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
you know but you can't be open covered

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.259 
you know but you can't be open covered
you<00:02:08.100> got<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:09.920> guess<00:02:10.920> regularly<00:02:11.730> what<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.090> get

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
you got a I guess regularly what you get

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.509 
you got a I guess regularly what you get
and<00:02:12.750> you'll<00:02:13.530> think<00:02:13.769> some<00:02:13.980> of<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.130> stuff<00:02:14.310> is

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
and you'll think some of the stuff is

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.910 
and you'll think some of the stuff is
good<00:02:14.730> but<00:02:15.170> you'll<00:02:16.170> be<00:02:16.290> able<00:02:16.380> to<00:02:16.530> make<00:02:16.709> way

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
good but you'll be able to make way

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.580 
good but you'll be able to make way
better<00:02:17.160> if<00:02:17.400> you<00:02:17.549> just<00:02:17.730> do<00:02:18.420> what<00:02:18.569> I<00:02:18.690> do<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:19.380> know

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
better if you just do what I do you know

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.750 
better if you just do what I do you know
so<00:02:20.010> what<00:02:20.730> I<00:02:20.760> do<00:02:20.850> is<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.239> take<00:02:22.130> iron<00:02:23.130> ingots

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
so what I do is I take iron ingots

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.699 
so what I do is I take iron ingots
leather<00:02:24.239> strips<00:02:24.630> and<00:02:24.870> just<00:02:25.260> take<00:02:25.410> his<00:02:25.530> money

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
leather strips and just take his money

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.960 
leather strips and just take his money
every<00:02:26.190> time<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:27.950> after<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.700> need<00:02:29.880> to

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
every time and after that you need to

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.750 
every time and after that you need to
wait<00:02:30.120> 48<00:02:30.540> hours<00:02:30.709> for<00:02:31.709> his<00:02:31.890> stock<00:02:32.160> to<00:02:32.370> resupply

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
wait 48 hours for his stock to resupply

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.569 
wait 48 hours for his stock to resupply
but<00:02:33.720> if<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:33.930> want<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.290> get<00:02:34.829> hit<00:02:35.010> a<00:02:35.040> new<00:02:35.250> stock

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
but if you want to get hit a new stock

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.710 
but if you want to get hit a new stock
then<00:02:35.910> you<00:02:36.000> have<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.299> talk<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:36.570> him<00:02:36.959> and<00:02:38.720> in
