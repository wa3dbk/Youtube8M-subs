just<00:02:22.980> because<00:02:23.220> he's<00:02:23.490> an<00:02:23.940> interesting

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
just because he's an interesting

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.110 
just because he's an interesting
character<00:02:25.380> and<00:02:25.410> adds<00:02:25.980> like<00:02:26.490> interesting

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
you touching in Sasuke is probably like

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.600

their<00:02:57.540> storyline<00:02:57.990> is<00:02:58.140> probably<00:02:58.410> like<00:02:58.620> the

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
their storyline is probably like the

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.850 
their storyline is probably like the
best<00:02:59.880> storyline<00:03:00.420> on<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.720> show<00:03:01.020> I<00:03:01.290> would<00:03:01.500> I

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
best storyline on the show I would I

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.680 
best storyline on the show I would I
would<00:03:02.010> have<00:03:02.190> to<00:03:02.340> say<00:03:02.550> it's<00:03:02.820> really<00:03:03.060> like<00:03:03.270> if

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
would have to say it's really like if

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.570 
would have to say it's really like if
it's<00:03:03.959> not<00:03:04.110> like<00:03:04.290> second<00:03:04.709> best<00:03:04.860> is<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.190> best<00:03:05.430> I

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
it's not like second best is the best I

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.949 
it's not like second best is the best I
can't<00:03:05.910> even<00:03:06.000> think<00:03:06.150> of<00:03:06.240> any<00:03:06.390> storyline<00:03:06.810> that's

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
can't even think of any storyline that's

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.140 
can't even think of any storyline that's
better<00:03:07.140> than<00:03:07.320> their<00:03:07.470> storyline<00:03:07.920> like<00:03:08.160> I<00:03:08.610> like

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
better than their storyline like I like

at<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.550> end<00:03:26.700> of<00:03:26.820> it<00:03:26.910> all<00:03:27.060> I<00:03:27.090> decided<00:03:27.480> that

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
at the end of it all I decided that

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.600

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
there could have been another way if he

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.430
