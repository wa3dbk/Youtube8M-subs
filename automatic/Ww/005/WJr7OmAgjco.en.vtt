 first suburban neighborhood that trauma returns 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:50.129
 a son named root was built by a man named in the end 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:54.189
 800 accesskey this area to start a small community of 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:56.319
 periphery 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.249
 this house existed at that time. even if there is already one on this ground 

00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:06.699
 building denon 1709 was much smaller with 2 rooms on the ground floor and 

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:08.719
 two rooms on the first floor

 skate ciao mare is on the other side of the mountains and faces the north 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.290
 while we look to the west 

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:42.809

 if you wear that thing of the Chinese having been built in 1993 you are 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.079
 facing south text is a typical thing of all times and I believe it is 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.059
 due to the fact that the first builders and the area they came from the night 

00:04:25.059 --> 00:04:28.120
 2- houses south-facing houses are useful 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.370
 they didn't understand black well and here it works contrary to chemistry if 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.870
 they should look north 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.930
 we are in the southern hemisphere and it is the opposite of Europe 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.430
 cassettes must be facing north and in order to get the most out of the sun 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.320
 in winter and staying in the shadow of the wild is a common mistake of the houses
