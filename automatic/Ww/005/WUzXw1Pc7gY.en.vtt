00:00:01.769 --> 00:00:05.240
 the injured is a tree of great quality and very long-lived 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.740
 the secanos adapt and endure the high temperatures although it does not resist 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:10.799
 well the cold 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:15.929
 does not have great demands regarding the type of terrain although it requires a floor 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.769
 deep 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:18.800
 segorbe 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.090
 with an altitude of 400 meters above sea level and a peaceful climate brings together 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.090
 the ideal conditions for the cultivation of olive trees 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.379
 in the olive tree they stand out their eternal silver-green color and on perceived trunk 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.800
 symbol of vitality and regeneration 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.260
 his silhouette despite the infinite variety of forms he adopts is always 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.640
 recognizable 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.050
 is part of their identity 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.770
 are roots have many superficial ramifications we take care of absorbing the 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.340
 nutrients 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.440
 the plug 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.650
 protuberance in the area of â€‹â€‹union between the root and the trunk 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.040
 it has the property of regenerating continuously new roots spring up and 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.410
 suckers 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.270
 the green-gray trunk indicates up to approximately 10 years 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.790
 over time it becomes doubtful 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.710
 with deep and twisted furrows adopting a dark almost black color 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.280
 The leaves of the olive tree are long green perennials on the top anticrisis 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.840
 silver on the bottom 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.680
 this silver color that embellishes olive trees reflects the sun's rays 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.900
 which decreases perspiration and consequently water loss 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.210
 in March or April the olive trees are dressed in bouquets of white flowers 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.060
 in spring the wind is responsible for transporting pollen grains from a 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.470
 tree to another 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.080
 Not all flowers are fertilized, only 5% can generate a 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.100
 olive 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.820
 green at the beginning 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.010
 after violet or red 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.350
 when you get to your mother 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.270
 or ivory white 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.530
 as the olive matures the small droplets of oil from its 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.479
 inside the lipids come together to form larger ones 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.829
 initially the amount of oil is small compared to the amount of water 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:16.369
 as I enjoyed taking purple coloring the oil increases and 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:20.469
 water is reduced to finish with a 32 percent success 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:24.399
 It is important to highlight the olive at that time 

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:27.969
 then decrease the oil again and increase the water
