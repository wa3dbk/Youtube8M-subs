00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.290
 50 grams tv 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.249
 50 grams of sifted flour 

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:12.569
 half liter of milk 

00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:15.569
 nutmeg 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.960
 soak the butter in a saucepan 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.089
 as soon as it comes out, add the flour in one go and stir quickly 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.080
 in this way there is no risk of lumps forming. and get a thick paste 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.080
 which is called bru 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.780
 at this point add previously heated milk and cook a 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.570
 low heat for about 15 minutes, stirring constantly with a whisk 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.290
 add salt is a pinch of nutmeg 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.630
 the starch granules contained in the flour in contact with the hot liquid 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.490
 they swell 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.749
 thanks to this increase in volume of the nest the sauce becomes thick and creamy 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.940
 the nest is a carbohydrate formed by long chains of glucose and sugar 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.940
 produced by photosynthesis 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.430
 it is synthesized by plants and has accumulated in the tissues as a reserve of 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.570
 power 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.090
 some plant organs are particularly rich in me like the potato 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.470
 which is the stem of the plant oh the signs of the cereals like grain that ground there 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.070
 from the flour
