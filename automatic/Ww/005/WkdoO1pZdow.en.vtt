 our grandmothers 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.820
 This wedding dress from miquel suay me 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.800
 love because it means a change of 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.080
 tendency especially to be colored 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.390
 black what will cause a great impact 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.390
 when the bride goes to the altar 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.880
 the simplicity and delicacy that emanate from 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.190
 this dress of immaculate garcia 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.550
 they make absolutely perfect for the day 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.550
 of your wedding 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.290
 this hayes villa dress has 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.330
 liked by the mixture of textures on 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.560
 everything is noticed in the skirt with the 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:19.700
 use of tulle and lace on the 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.700
 spikes of the flyers 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.040
 this time I show you a 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.620
 spectacular design of immaculate garcia 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.410
 inspired by the sheet at the beginning of 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:44.290
 20th century what is most striking is 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.290
 the coat and the texture of the skirt 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.440
 here we have another example of the signature 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:01.170
 villares and in this case what we like 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.170
 is the use of fabrics as a network 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.500
 this dress of immaculate garcia me 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:16.930
 like it especially for romanticism 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.700
 and the elegance that comes off I think it's 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.700
 absolutely wonderful 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.670

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.330
 of the trends that many designers
