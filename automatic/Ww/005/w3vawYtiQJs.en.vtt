00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
blocks away from that got it and then if

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.449 
blocks away from that got it and then if
I<00:03:29.940> right-click<00:03:30.150> right<00:03:30.660> there<00:03:30.959> it<00:03:31.560> puts<00:03:32.069> in<00:03:32.250> the

to<00:03:41.069> be<00:03:41.190> able<00:03:41.280> to<00:03:41.400> measure<00:03:41.579> stuff<00:03:41.910> and<00:03:42.120> you<00:03:42.180> can

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
to be able to measure stuff and you can

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.690 
to be able to measure stuff and you can
and<00:03:42.630> when<00:03:42.870> you<00:03:43.049> when<00:03:43.620> I<00:03:43.650> when<00:03:44.010> you<00:03:44.040> do<00:03:44.310> that<00:03:44.459> the

the<00:03:46.590> second<00:03:47.010> right-click<00:03:47.400> boom<00:03:47.819> gives<00:03:48.120> you

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
the second right-click boom gives you

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.140 
the second right-click boom gives you
the<00:03:48.480> chat<00:03:49.109> readout<00:03:49.680> of<00:03:49.919> how<00:03:50.459> many<00:03:50.609> blocks<00:03:50.910> it

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
the chat readout of how many blocks it

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.059 
the chat readout of how many blocks it
was<00:03:51.329> and<00:03:51.810> it<00:03:52.049> also<00:03:52.200> destroys<00:03:52.769> the<00:03:52.980> original

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
was and it also destroys the original

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.509 
was and it also destroys the original
marker<00:03:53.780> like<00:03:54.780> that<00:03:54.989> perfect<00:03:55.620> so<00:03:56.310> let's

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
marker like that perfect so let's

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.069 
marker like that perfect so let's
measure<00:03:56.819> our<00:03:57.120> base<00:03:57.329> and<00:03:57.660> complete<00:03:57.930> this

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
measure our base and complete this

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.780 
measure our base and complete this
