00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.360 
you can maybe get a piece of graph paper
and<00:02:42.020> chart<00:02:42.350> them<00:02:42.500> out<00:02:42.650> so<00:02:42.860> they're<00:02:43.010> even

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
and chart them out so they're even

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.259 
and chart them out so they're even
whatever<00:02:43.700> you<00:02:43.880> want<00:02:44.090> to<00:02:44.150> do<00:02:44.330> oops

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.960 
they're snugged up against the needle
but<00:05:10.449> you<00:05:10.600> can<00:05:10.750> kind<00:05:11.080> of<00:05:11.199> tell<00:05:11.789> where<00:05:12.789> they<00:05:12.940> are

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
but you can kind of tell where they are

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.000 
but you can kind of tell where they are
there's<00:05:13.479> one<00:05:13.690> there<00:05:13.990> and<00:05:14.410> then<00:05:14.650> there's<00:05:14.830> my

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
there's one there and then there's my

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.279 
there's one there and then there's my
second<00:05:15.400> one<00:05:15.520> they<00:05:16.419> will<00:05:16.570> stand<00:05:16.870> out<00:05:17.050> better

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:17.289 
second one they will stand out better

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:21.719 
second one they will stand out better
once<00:05:17.590> you<00:05:17.830> knit<00:05:18.070> the<00:05:18.910> next<00:05:19.090> row<00:05:19.780> or<00:05:20.199> two<00:05:20.500> and<00:05:21.039> I

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:21.729 
once you knit the next row or two and I

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:23.189 
once you knit the next row or two and I
find<00:05:22.000> sometimes<00:05:22.240> that<00:05:22.600> I<00:05:22.630> have<00:05:22.810> to<00:05:22.930> kind<00:05:23.080> of

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.199 
find sometimes that I have to kind of

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:24.930 
find sometimes that I have to kind of
push<00:05:23.470> them<00:05:23.650> out<00:05:23.830> from<00:05:24.070> the<00:05:24.100> back<00:05:24.310> a<00:05:24.370> little<00:05:24.669> bit

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
push them out from the back a little bit

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.409 
push them out from the back a little bit
but<00:05:26.460> like<00:05:27.460> I<00:05:27.610> said<00:05:27.669> I<00:05:27.820> do<00:05:27.880> think<00:05:28.150> they<00:05:28.270> are<00:05:28.389> a

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
but like I said I do think they are a

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:31.440 
but like I said I do think they are a
little<00:05:28.570> bit<00:05:28.750> easier<00:05:29.080> than<00:05:29.139> bobbles<00:05:29.770> and<00:05:30.450> you

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
little bit easier than bobbles and you

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.300 
little bit easier than bobbles and you
can<00:05:31.599> see<00:05:31.840> here<00:05:32.440> are<00:05:32.590> the<00:05:32.680> little<00:05:32.830> popcorn

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
can see here are the little popcorn

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.610 
can see here are the little popcorn
stitches
