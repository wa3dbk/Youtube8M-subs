here<00:02:06.479> this<00:02:06.509> would<00:02:06.750> be<00:02:06.780> aluminum<00:02:07.440> version

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
here this would be aluminum version

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.960 
here this would be aluminum version
right<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.250> difference<00:02:08.369> between<00:02:08.700> the

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
right the difference between the

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.690 
right the difference between the
resistor<00:02:09.539> okay<00:02:10.110> that's<00:02:10.320> right<00:02:10.619> oh<00:02:11.039> but<00:02:11.670> I

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
resistor okay that's right oh but I

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.100 
resistor okay that's right oh but I
think<00:02:11.910> actually<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.300> internal<00:02:12.660> -<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:12.959> is

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
think actually the internal - that is

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.509 
think actually the internal - that is
great<00:02:13.350> it's<00:02:13.650> great<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.190> other<00:02:14.310> one<00:02:14.430> is

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
great it's great and the other one is

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.390 
great it's great and the other one is
blastocyst<00:02:15.120> -<00:02:15.360> yeah<00:02:16.260> okay

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
blastocyst - yeah okay

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.699 
blastocyst - yeah okay
but<00:02:17.700> that's<00:02:17.850> also<00:02:18.000> got<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.360> same<00:02:18.709> sitting

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
but that's also got the same sitting

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.740 
but that's also got the same sitting
functional<00:02:20.250> yeah<00:02:20.459> it's<00:02:21.060> just<00:02:21.300> I<00:02:21.420> don't<00:02:21.630> know

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
functional yeah it's just I don't know

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.570 
functional yeah it's just I don't know
if<00:02:21.870> you<00:02:21.930> can<00:02:22.019> pick<00:02:22.260> up<00:02:22.350> on<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.680> distances<00:02:23.340> here

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
if you can pick up on the distances here

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.940 
if you can pick up on the distances here
see<00:02:23.790> I<00:02:23.819> you<00:02:23.940> can<00:02:24.209> yeah<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:25.260> they're<00:02:25.560> in<00:02:25.709> so

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
see I you can yeah and they're in so

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.170 
see I you can yeah and they're in so
does<00:02:26.130> this<00:02:26.310> one<00:02:26.550> since<00:02:26.730> it's<00:02:26.910> a<00:02:26.970> stainless

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
does this one since it's a stainless

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.479 
does this one since it's a stainless
steel<00:02:27.360> on<00:02:28.320> the<00:02:28.380> right<00:02:28.769> that's<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.160> little<00:02:29.250> bit

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
steel on the right that's a little bit

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.870 
steel on the right that's a little bit
heavier

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.520 

so<00:02:33.880> let's<00:02:34.120> see<00:02:34.270> we've<00:02:34.780> probably<00:02:35.110> had<00:02:35.260> about<00:02:35.410> a

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
so let's see we've probably had about a

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.520 
so let's see we've probably had about a
minute<00:02:35.860> now<00:02:35.890> so<00:02:36.720> everything<00:02:37.720> is<00:02:37.840> just<00:02:37.990> a<00:02:38.200> work

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
minute now so everything is just a work

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
minute now so everything is just a work
in<00:02:38.680> progress<00:02:38.860> around<00:02:39.370> here<00:02:39.520> it<00:02:39.970> is<00:02:40.800> so<00:02:41.800> yeah

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
in progress around here it is so yeah

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.070 
in progress around here it is so yeah
one<00:02:42.970> of<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.090> things<00:02:43.240> I<00:02:43.330> love<00:02:43.510> about<00:02:43.540> this<00:02:43.870> is

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
one of the things I love about this is

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.660 
one of the things I love about this is
the<00:02:44.110> fact<00:02:44.380> that<00:02:44.530> it<00:02:44.709> is<00:02:44.830> cordless<00:02:45.280> so<00:02:45.580> you

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
the fact that it is cordless so you

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.190 
the fact that it is cordless so you
could<00:02:45.940> put<00:02:46.120> it<00:02:46.150> you<00:02:46.630> have<00:02:46.780> a<00:02:46.810> bunch<00:02:46.990> of<00:02:47.080> these

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
could put it you have a bunch of these

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.900 
could put it you have a bunch of these
like<00:02:47.380> in<00:02:47.560> your<00:02:47.709> pantry<00:02:48.160> if<00:02:48.340> you<00:02:48.489> want<00:02:48.700> to<00:02:48.819> in

like in your pantry if you want to in

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.059 
like in your pantry if you want to in

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
don't have this you have a cat it will

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.830 
don't have this you have a cat it will
scare<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:57.310> hell<00:02:57.459> out<00:02:57.610> of<00:02:57.640> it<00:02:57.850> every<00:02:58.060> 12<00:02:58.360> to<00:02:58.510> 48

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
scare the hell out of it every 12 to 48

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.640 
scare the hell out of it every 12 to 48
hours<00:02:59.200> right<00:03:00.069> down<00:03:00.250> here<00:03:00.640> is<00:03:01.480> what<00:03:01.780> actually

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
hours right down here is what actually

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.479 
hours right down here is what actually
if<00:03:03.130> you<00:03:03.430> don't<00:03:03.610> have<00:03:03.880> that<00:03:05.010> it<00:03:06.010> won't<00:03:06.220> work

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
if you don't have that it won't work

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.040 
if you don't have that it won't work
I<00:03:06.730> see<00:03:07.209> okay<00:03:07.780> so<00:03:08.019> there<00:03:08.200> we<00:03:08.230> go<00:03:08.350> oh<00:03:09.300> yeah<00:03:10.300> see<00:03:11.019> oh

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
it's not that it's flush it's like it's

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.330 
it's not that it's flush it's like it's
completely<00:03:13.510> depressed<00:03:14.110> below<00:03:14.530> beneath<00:03:14.980> it

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
completely depressed below beneath it

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.610 
completely depressed below beneath it
okay<00:03:15.580> below<00:03:15.970> but<00:03:16.269> those<00:03:16.480> dips<00:03:16.870> coffee<00:03:17.350> why
