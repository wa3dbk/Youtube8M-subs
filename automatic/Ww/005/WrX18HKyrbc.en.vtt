kind of look at the snow projection this

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.270 
kind of look at the snow projection this
is<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.209> probability<00:02:45.719> of<00:02:45.959> more<00:02:46.470> than<00:02:46.500> one<00:02:47.010> inch

tomorrow morning and look at that those

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.679 
tomorrow morning and look at that those
numbers<00:02:51.900> are<00:02:52.400> you<00:02:53.400> know<00:02:53.519> what<00:02:53.879> in<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.120> seventy

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:41.699 
than we've had cold court systems like

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:44.059 
than we've had cold court systems like
this<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.629> one<00:03:42.780> in<00:03:42.870> December<00:03:43.260> 97<00:03:43.859> brought

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
this the one in December 97 brought

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:45.860 
this the one in December 97 brought
eight<00:03:44.280> inches<00:03:44.669> of<00:03:44.729> heavy<00:03:45.000> wet<00:03:45.239> snow<00:03:45.419> to<00:03:45.599> parts

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
eight inches of heavy wet snow to parts

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.430 
eight inches of heavy wet snow to parts
of<00:03:46.139> Mississippi<00:03:46.949> if<00:03:47.549> you<00:03:47.669> recall<00:03:48.079> but<00:03:49.079> again<00:03:49.409> I

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
of Mississippi if you recall but again I

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.990 
of Mississippi if you recall but again I
think<00:03:49.590> that's<00:03:50.040> going<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.310> be<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.549> bullseye

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
think that's going to be the bullseye

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.849 
think that's going to be the bullseye
and<00:03:51.299> then<00:03:51.449> as<00:03:51.599> you<00:03:51.629> go<00:03:51.810> farther<00:03:52.019> south<00:03:52.440> we<00:03:52.650> just

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
and then as you go farther south we just

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:54.649 
and then as you go farther south we just
mentioned<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.190> dusting<00:03:53.669> on<00:03:53.760> grassy<00:03:54.299> areas

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:54.659 
mentioned the dusting on grassy areas

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:57.050 
mentioned the dusting on grassy areas
and<00:03:54.750> even<00:03:54.959> that's<00:03:55.079> kind<00:03:55.290> of<00:03:55.379> iffy<00:03:55.699> but<00:03:56.699> you

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
and even that's kind of iffy but you

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.490 
and even that's kind of iffy but you
know<00:03:57.150> that<00:03:57.389> line<00:03:57.659> up<00:03:57.840> there<00:03:57.989> in<00:03:58.079> North<00:03:58.290> West

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
know that line up there in North West

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.080 
know that line up there in North West
Alabama<00:03:58.799> is<00:03:59.099> going<00:03:59.220> to<00:03:59.280> be<00:03:59.370> the<00:03:59.489> hard<00:03:59.729> line<00:03:59.939> to

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
Alabama is going to be the hard line to

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.149 
Alabama is going to be the hard line to
draw<00:04:00.359> there<00:04:00.930> could<00:04:01.229> be<00:04:01.260> some<00:04:01.590> accumulating

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 
draw there could be some accumulating

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:04.039 
draw there could be some accumulating
snow<00:04:02.280> as<00:04:02.699> far<00:04:02.909> south<00:04:03.150> as<00:04:03.209> Hamilton<00:04:03.750> in

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
snow as far south as Hamilton in

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.339 
snow as far south as Hamilton in
Haleyville<00:04:04.560> and<00:04:04.799> molten<00:04:05.220> and<00:04:05.340> russellville

Haleyville and molten and russellville

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.080 
Haleyville and molten and russellville
but<00:04:07.349> remember<00:04:07.650> two<00:04:08.069> things<00:04:08.099> the<00:04:08.639> ground<00:04:08.909> is

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
but remember two things the ground is

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.210 
but remember two things the ground is
very<00:04:09.150> warm<00:04:09.569> in<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:10.409> surface<00:04:10.769> temperatures

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
very warm in the surface temperatures

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.740 
very warm in the surface temperatures
even<00:04:11.579> with<00:04:11.729> heavy<00:04:11.909> snowfall<00:04:12.479> and<00:04:12.599> will

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
even with heavy snowfall and will

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.319 
even with heavy snowfall and will
probably<00:04:13.199> be<00:04:13.349> above<00:04:13.620> freezing<00:04:14.120> but<00:04:15.120> it<00:04:15.209> could

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
probably be above freezing but it could

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:16.759 
probably be above freezing but it could
fall<00:04:15.599> heavy<00:04:15.870> enough<00:04:16.139> to<00:04:16.289> get<00:04:16.409> on<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.590> roads

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
fall heavy enough to get on the roads

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.349 
fall heavy enough to get on the roads
for<00:04:17.009> a<00:04:17.039> brief<00:04:17.250> time<00:04:17.280> so<00:04:17.820> we'll<00:04:17.940> have<00:04:18.060> to<00:04:18.180> watch

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
for a brief time so we'll have to watch

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.330 
for a brief time so we'll have to watch
it<00:04:18.389> for<00:04:18.690> North<00:04:18.900> West<00:04:19.139> Alabama<00:04:19.440> the<00:04:20.130> greater

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
it for North West Alabama the greater

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.979

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
chance of issues around the shoals and

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.440 
chance of issues around the shoals and

the<00:05:53.110> RPM<00:05:53.680> snow<00:05:54.460> accumulation<00:05:55.150> projection<00:05:56.070> and

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.070 
the RPM snow accumulation projection and

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:00.000 
the RPM snow accumulation projection and
I<00:05:57.280> think<00:05:57.700> this<00:05:57.850> is<00:05:58.090> pretty<00:05:58.540> good<00:05:58.840> it's<00:05:59.290> got<00:05:59.560> the

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.010 
I think this is pretty good it's got the

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.100 
I think this is pretty good it's got the
better<00:06:00.130> chance<00:06:00.460> of<00:06:00.640> getting<00:06:00.850> the<00:06:01.630> good<00:06:01.810> snows

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
better chance of getting the good snows

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:03.960 
better chance of getting the good snows
in<00:06:02.380> that<00:06:02.530> zone<00:06:02.770> I<00:06:02.979> pretty<00:06:03.220> much<00:06:03.310> drawn<00:06:03.700> up<00:06:03.850> in

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:03.970 
in that zone I pretty much drawn up in

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.280 
in that zone I pretty much drawn up in

there east of Memphis in North far north
west<00:06:08.530> alabama<00:06:08.860> it's<00:06:09.280> suggesting<00:06:09.820> 224<00:06:10.300> but

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:10.450 
west alabama it's suggesting 224 but

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.510 
west alabama it's suggesting 224 but
remember<00:06:10.930> the<00:06:11.470> ground<00:06:11.680> is<00:06:11.919> really<00:06:12.160> warm<00:06:12.340> and

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
remember the ground is really warm and

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.980 
remember the ground is really warm and
this<00:06:12.669> thing<00:06:12.850> probably<00:06:13.120> doesn't<00:06:13.660> take<00:06:13.840> that

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
this thing probably doesn't take that

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.409 
this thing probably doesn't take that
into<00:06:14.229> account<00:06:14.260> and<00:06:15.160> I<00:06:15.700> know<00:06:15.760> it's<00:06:15.970> got<00:06:16.150> light

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:16.419 
into account and I know it's got light

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:18.000

Roanoke<00:06:18.820> but<00:06:19.090> again<00:06:19.600> you<00:06:20.350> got<00:06:20.560> to<00:06:20.680> take<00:06:20.800> into

Roanoke but again you got to take into

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:23.159 
Roanoke but again you got to take into
account<00:06:21.280> the<00:06:21.580> fact<00:06:21.760> this<00:06:22.120> is<00:06:22.270> an<00:06:22.419> anomalous

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:23.169 
account the fact this is an anomalous

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:25.680 
account the fact this is an anomalous
situation<00:06:23.790> but<00:06:24.790> i<00:06:24.850> think<00:06:25.060> that<00:06:25.090> bullseye<00:06:25.630> is

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:25.690 
situation but i think that bullseye is

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.080 
situation but i think that bullseye is

festival paso a strong trough in the
northern<00:06:43.370> branch<00:06:43.610> is<00:06:43.850> not<00:06:44.000> fazed<00:06:44.300> up<00:06:44.570> at<00:06:44.720> this

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:44.840 
northern branch is not fazed up at this

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.470 
northern branch is not fazed up at this
point<00:06:45.080> down<00:06:45.440> below<00:06:45.710> that<00:06:45.919> we<00:06:46.070> stay<00:06:46.280> dry<00:06:46.520> rain

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:47.480 
point down below that we stay dry rain

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.420 
point down below that we stay dry rain
as<00:06:47.660> well<00:06:47.840> to<00:06:48.020> the<00:06:48.110> west<00:06:48.290> and<00:06:48.590> sunday<00:06:49.070> looks<00:06:49.340> dry

as well to the west and sunday looks dry

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.810 
as well to the west and sunday looks dry
so<00:06:49.940> if<00:06:50.120> this<00:06:50.300> is<00:06:50.479> right<00:06:50.630> the<00:06:50.840> weekend<00:06:51.229> would<00:06:51.410> be

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:51.820 
so if this is right the weekend would be

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.920 
so if this is right the weekend would be
seasonal<00:06:52.820> maybe<00:06:53.000> highs<00:06:53.270> in<00:06:53.479> the<00:06:53.510> upper<00:06:53.600> 50s
