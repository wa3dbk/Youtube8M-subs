00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
thoroughly detangled some of you guys

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.729 
thoroughly detangled some of you guys
have<00:00:57.570> mentioned<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.109> when<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.469> do<00:00:58.590> your

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
have mentioned that when you do your

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.500 
have mentioned that when you do your
blowouts<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.250> have<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.399> lot<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.609> breakage<00:01:00.120> this

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
blowouts you have a lot of breakage this

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.869 
blowouts you have a lot of breakage this
step<00:01:00.750> really<00:01:01.079> helps<00:01:01.440> in<00:01:01.620> keeping<00:01:02.219> breakage<00:01:02.730> at

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
step really helps in keeping breakage at

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.100 
step really helps in keeping breakage at
a<00:01:02.910> minimum<00:01:03.270> because<00:01:03.480> your<00:01:03.780> hair<00:01:03.960> will<00:01:04.080> be

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
a minimum because your hair will be

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.960 
a minimum because your hair will be
detangled<00:01:04.799> before<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.280> put<00:01:05.519> any<00:01:05.670> film
