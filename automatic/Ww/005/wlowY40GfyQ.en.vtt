00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
sure everything is lined up by the way I

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.050 
sure everything is lined up by the way I
wiped<00:04:51.180> it<00:04:51.360> clean<00:04:51.590> so<00:04:52.590> there's<00:04:52.790> hardly<00:04:53.790> any

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
wiped it clean so there's hardly any

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:03.100 
wiped it clean so there's hardly any
dust<00:04:54.360> on<00:04:54.570> here<00:04:56.330> here<00:04:57.330> we<00:04:57.449> go

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.330 

actually<00:05:04.110> before<00:05:04.289> I<00:05:04.470> do<00:05:04.530> that<00:05:05.060> there<00:05:06.060> is

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
actually before I do that there is

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.830 
actually before I do that there is
installation<00:05:08.340> directions<00:05:08.820> right<00:05:09.030> there<00:05:09.270> so

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
installation directions right there so

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.159 
installation directions right there so
you<00:05:09.930> can<00:05:10.050> see<00:05:10.910> fit<00:05:11.910> the<00:05:12.120> left<00:05:12.360> side<00:05:12.600> first<00:05:12.870> and

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
you can see fit the left side first and

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:15.950 
you can see fit the left side first and
then<00:05:13.260> snap<00:05:14.250> and<00:05:14.610> push<00:05:15.060> in<00:05:15.270> onto<00:05:15.600> the<00:05:15.720> right

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
then snap and push in onto the right

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.250 
then snap and push in onto the right
upper<00:05:16.229> side<00:05:16.470> and<00:05:17.060> here<00:05:18.060> my<00:05:18.690> choices<00:05:18.960> for

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
upper side and here my choices for

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.040 
upper side and here my choices for
removing<00:05:19.770> the<00:05:19.889> case<00:05:20.270> so<00:05:21.270> let's<00:05:21.479> put<00:05:21.780> that<00:05:21.810> to

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
removing the case so let's put that to

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:28.430 
removing the case so let's put that to
good<00:05:22.080> use<00:05:23.900> so<00:05:24.900> I<00:05:24.930> like<00:05:25.620> what<00:05:25.800> it<00:05:25.860> says<00:05:27.199> the<00:05:28.199> left

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
good use so I like what it says the left

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:34.990 
good use so I like what it says the left
side<00:05:28.650> first<00:05:28.889> snap<00:05:29.700> it<00:05:29.849> in<00:05:29.970> on<00:05:30.180> upper<00:05:30.510> right

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:43.790
