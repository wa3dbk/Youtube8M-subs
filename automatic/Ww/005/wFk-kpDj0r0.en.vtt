know<00:01:42.479> there's<00:01:42.780> videos<00:01:43.170> out<00:01:43.380> there<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.680> how<00:01:43.799> to

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
know there's videos out there of how to

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.460 
know there's videos out there of how to
do<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.310> but<00:01:44.520> really<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.450> can't<00:01:45.720> there's

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
do it but really you can't there's

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.319 
do it but really you can't there's
nothing<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:47.009> know<00:01:47.100> as<00:01:47.280> I'm<00:01:47.460> flipping<00:01:48.210> this

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
nothing you know as I'm flipping this

there's nothing to maintain with these

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.760 
there's nothing to maintain with these
these<00:01:53.939> are<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.149> little<00:01:54.270> more<00:01:54.450> expensive<00:01:55.320> per

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
these are a little more expensive per

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.940 
these are a little more expensive per
amp<00:01:56.009> hour<00:01:56.280> than<00:01:56.960> say<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.170> flooded<00:01:58.799> lead-acid

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950

provide my my battery
our<00:02:13.799> so<00:02:14.799> these<00:02:15.129> are<00:02:15.310> great<00:02:15.670> to<00:02:16.659> a<00:02:16.689> certain

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
our so these are great to a certain

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.390 
our so these are great to a certain
point<00:02:17.290> you<00:02:17.470> don't<00:02:17.620> want<00:02:17.799> to<00:02:17.890> use<00:02:18.010> these<00:02:18.159> with

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
point you don't want to use these with

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.610

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
car batteries are meant to provide a lot

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.539 
car batteries are meant to provide a lot
of<00:02:57.489> juice<00:02:57.790> fast<00:02:58.750> they<00:02:59.560> don't<00:02:59.590> last<00:02:59.980> very<00:03:00.190> long

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
of juice fast they don't last very long

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.509 
of juice fast they don't last very long

and they're not meant to go very long
between<00:03:03.519> charges<00:03:05.310> so<00:03:06.310> think<00:03:06.549> of<00:03:06.639> it<00:03:06.730> like<00:03:06.849> a

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:06.909 
between charges so think of it like a

provide a lot of power a lot of juice
whereas<00:03:13.690> these<00:03:14.109> are<00:03:14.560> meant<00:03:15.099> to<00:03:15.250> be<00:03:15.489> drained

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
whereas these are meant to be drained

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.259 
whereas these are meant to be drained
slowly<00:03:16.659> over<00:03:17.079> time<00:03:17.290> and<00:03:17.709> meant<00:03:17.919> to<00:03:18.129> be<00:03:19.000> drained

slowly over time and meant to be drained
much<00:03:19.569> further<00:03:19.870> down<00:03:20.199> these<00:03:20.470> these<00:03:21.099> you<00:03:21.310> can

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
much further down these these you can

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.659 
much further down these these you can
drain<00:03:21.760> down<00:03:21.970> to<00:03:22.209> 50%<00:03:22.690> no<00:03:23.199> problem<00:03:23.739> over<00:03:24.519> and

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:24.669 
drain down to 50% no problem over and

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:26.309 
drain down to 50% no problem over and
over<00:03:24.849> again<00:03:24.940> these<00:03:25.389> if<00:03:25.690> you<00:03:25.780> drain<00:03:26.019> them<00:03:26.139> more

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
over again these if you drain them more

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:28.830 
over again these if you drain them more
than<00:03:26.410> about<00:03:26.590> 10%<00:03:26.889> if<00:03:27.639> they<00:03:27.819> go<00:03:27.970> below<00:03:28.299> let's

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
than about 10% if they go below let's

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.199 
than about 10% if they go below let's
say<00:03:28.959> 11<00:03:29.379> volts<00:03:29.799> or<00:03:29.980> so<00:03:30.280> they're<00:03:31.000> basically

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
say 11 volts or so they're basically

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.240 
say 11 volts or so they're basically
dead<00:03:31.720> you<00:03:32.379> can't<00:03:32.620> revive<00:03:32.949> them<00:03:33.099> they're

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
dead you can't revive them they're

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.809 
dead you can't revive them they're
permanently<00:03:33.669> damaged<00:03:34.180> so<00:03:35.129> you<00:03:36.129> can<00:03:36.310> use<00:03:36.609> these

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
permanently damaged so you can use these

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.059 
permanently damaged so you can use these
in<00:03:37.060> solar<00:03:37.359> in<00:03:37.720> an<00:03:37.840> emergency<00:03:38.260> if<00:03:38.500> you<00:03:38.650> have<00:03:38.829> to

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
in solar in an emergency if you have to

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:40.559 
in solar in an emergency if you have to
but<00:03:39.340> just<00:03:39.370> keep<00:03:39.819> that<00:03:40.000> in<00:03:40.060> mind<00:03:40.329> that<00:03:40.419> you

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
but just keep that in mind that you

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.319 
but just keep that in mind that you
don't<00:03:40.720> want<00:03:40.870> to<00:03:40.959> use<00:03:41.109> these<00:03:41.290> for<00:03:41.530> very<00:03:41.769> long<00:03:42.329> if

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
don't want to use these for very long if

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.960 
don't want to use these for very long if
you're<00:03:43.540> using<00:03:43.870> backup<00:03:44.470> power<00:03:44.680> you<00:03:45.609> know<00:03:45.699> run

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
you're using backup power you know run

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.640 
you're using backup power you know run
this<00:03:46.120> for<00:03:46.299> five<00:03:46.569> minutes<00:03:46.959> but<00:03:47.109> then<00:03:47.290> turn<00:03:47.500> it

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
this for five minutes but then turn it

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.089 
this for five minutes but then turn it
off<00:03:47.799> you<00:03:48.609> do<00:03:48.790> not<00:03:48.819> want<00:03:49.269> to<00:03:49.720> you'll<00:03:50.410> kill<00:03:50.949> these

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:51.099 
off you do not want to you'll kill these

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:55.289 
off you do not want to you'll kill these
things<00:03:51.129> quick<00:03:52.410> so<00:03:53.410> the<00:03:54.069> last<00:03:54.310> option<00:03:54.639> this<00:03:55.120> is

was<00:04:29.770> saying<00:04:30.010> these<00:04:30.190> are<00:04:30.370> like<00:04:30.640> marathon

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
was saying these are like marathon

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.700 
was saying these are like marathon
runners<00:04:31.540> instead<00:04:31.900> of<00:04:31.990> the<00:04:32.080> sprinters<00:04:32.470> these

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
runners instead of the sprinters these

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.830 
runners instead of the sprinters these
are<00:04:33.160> meant<00:04:34.030> to<00:04:34.270> go<00:04:34.780> long<00:04:35.200> a<00:04:35.710> long<00:04:36.190> time<00:04:36.520> and<00:04:36.970> and

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
are meant to go long a long time and and

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.660 
are meant to go long a long time and and
take<00:04:38.230> the<00:04:38.380> abuse<00:04:38.620> over<00:04:39.100> and<00:04:39.280> over<00:04:39.490> and<00:04:39.580> over

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670 
take the abuse over and over and over

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.300 
take the abuse over and over and over
again<00:04:39.910> so<00:04:40.810> these<00:04:41.050> are<00:04:41.320> what<00:04:41.500> you<00:04:41.650> really<00:04:41.950> want

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
again so these are what you really want

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.150 
again so these are what you really want
to<00:04:42.460> use<00:04:42.760> when<00:04:43.300> you<00:04:43.330> get<00:04:43.750> to<00:04:44.140> a<00:04:44.170> certain<00:04:44.620> size<00:04:44.860> of

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
to use when you get to a certain size of

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.420 
to use when you get to a certain size of
a<00:04:45.250> system<00:04:45.700> you<00:04:45.910> do<00:04:46.030> not<00:04:46.180> want<00:04:46.540> to<00:04:47.310> you<00:04:48.310> know

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
a system you do not want to you know

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.190 
a system you do not want to you know
string<00:04:48.790> together<00:04:48.970> a<00:04:49.270> ton<00:04:49.540> of<00:04:49.600> these<00:04:49.780> now<00:04:50.020> this

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
string together a ton of these now this

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.480 
string together a ton of these now this
is<00:04:50.320> a<00:04:50.350> smaller<00:04:50.710> one<00:04:50.830> you<00:04:51.010> can<00:04:51.190> get<00:04:51.280> bigger

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
is a smaller one you can get bigger

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.060 
is a smaller one you can get bigger
sealed<00:04:52.060> lead-acid<00:04:52.300> batteries<00:04:53.020> than<00:04:53.500> that<00:04:53.770> but

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
sealed lead-acid batteries than that but

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.950 
sealed lead-acid batteries than that but
these<00:04:54.880> are<00:04:55.060> quite<00:04:55.360> a<00:04:55.420> bit<00:04:55.480> more<00:04:55.600> expensive

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
these are quite a bit more expensive

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.850 
these are quite a bit more expensive
these<00:04:56.230> were<00:04:56.410> only<00:04:56.530> 80<00:04:56.830> bucks<00:04:56.950> apiece<00:04:57.480> so<00:04:58.480> and<00:04:58.900> a

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
these were only 80 bucks apiece so and a

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.160 
these were only 80 bucks apiece so and a
similar-sized<00:05:00.580> sealed<00:05:01.360> lead-acid<00:05:01.570> battery

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
similar-sized sealed lead-acid battery

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:06.000 
similar-sized sealed lead-acid battery
to<00:05:02.350> this<00:05:02.530> would<00:05:02.800> be<00:05:03.240> you<00:05:04.240> know<00:05:04.330> 150<00:05:04.870> plus<00:05:05.140> so

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
to this would be you know 150 plus so

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.130 
to this would be you know 150 plus so
you<00:05:06.640> do<00:05:06.820> have<00:05:06.850> to<00:05:07.120> maintain<00:05:07.540> these<00:05:07.720> you<00:05:08.020> do

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
you do have to maintain these you do

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:13.110 
you do have to maintain these you do
have<00:05:08.350> to<00:05:10.350> fill<00:05:11.350> these<00:05:11.560> up<00:05:11.620> with<00:05:11.970> fluid<00:05:12.970> you<00:05:13.090> can

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
have to fill these up with fluid you can

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.000 
have to fill these up with fluid you can
see<00:05:13.450> that<00:05:13.600> there's<00:05:13.810> fluid<00:05:14.170> in<00:05:14.260> there<00:05:14.910> but<00:05:17.010> they

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
see that there's fluid in there but they

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.710 
see that there's fluid in there but they
do<00:05:18.160> require<00:05:18.340> little<00:05:18.760> maintenance<00:05:18.910> but<00:05:19.360> that

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
do require little maintenance but that

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.540 
do require little maintenance but that
these<00:05:19.900> are<00:05:19.960> what<00:05:20.530> you<00:05:20.650> want<00:05:20.830> to<00:05:20.950> use<00:05:21.160> in<00:05:21.460> a

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
these are what you want to use in a

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.390 
these are what you want to use in a
solar<00:05:21.790> panel<00:05:22.030> system<00:05:22.540> of<00:05:22.660> any<00:05:23.400> significant
