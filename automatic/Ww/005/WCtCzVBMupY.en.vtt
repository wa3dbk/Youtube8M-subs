00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.939 

we're<00:00:00.659> going<00:00:00.750> to<00:00:00.840> use<00:00:01.020> a<00:00:01.050> bottle<00:00:01.290> of<00:00:01.530> galfer

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
we're going to use a bottle of galfer

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.190 
we're going to use a bottle of galfer
super<00:00:02.310> dot<00:00:02.490> fluid<00:00:02.939> you<00:00:03.600> always<00:00:03.870> want<00:00:04.020> to<00:00:04.080> make

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
super dot fluid you always want to make

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.200 
super dot fluid you always want to make
sure<00:00:04.259> they<00:00:04.529> use<00:00:04.680> a<00:00:04.710> brand<00:00:05.069> new<00:00:05.310> bottle<00:00:05.520> if<00:00:05.850> you

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
sure they use a brand new bottle if you

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.639 
sure they use a brand new bottle if you
have<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.480> bottle<00:00:06.720> open<00:00:06.960> for<00:00:07.230> more<00:00:07.500> than<00:00:07.589> a

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
have the bottle open for more than a

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.040 
have the bottle open for more than a
month<00:00:07.859> we'd<00:00:08.099> say<00:00:08.340> get<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.639> new<00:00:08.820> one<00:00:08.940> brake<00:00:09.780> fluid

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
month we'd say get a new one brake fluid

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.509 
month we'd say get a new one brake fluid
is<00:00:10.139> very<00:00:10.349> hydroscopic<00:00:10.860> meaning<00:00:11.099> that<00:00:11.400> it's

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
is very hydroscopic meaning that it's

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:12.709 
is very hydroscopic meaning that it's
going<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:11.700> absorb<00:00:11.790> moisture<00:00:12.210> out<00:00:12.540> of<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.660> air

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
going to absorb moisture out of the air

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.990 
going to absorb moisture out of the air
and<00:00:12.990> moisture<00:00:13.620> in<00:00:13.920> your<00:00:13.950> brake<00:00:14.219> fluid<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:14.759> an

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
and moisture in your brake fluid is an

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.849 
and moisture in your brake fluid is an
enemy<00:00:15.120> so<00:00:15.630> you<00:00:15.719> don't<00:00:16.049> want<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.350> do<00:00:16.470> that<00:00:16.500> so

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
enemy so you don't want to do that so

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.650 
enemy so you don't want to do that so
always<00:00:17.039> use<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.310> new<00:00:17.490> bottle<00:00:17.670> so<00:00:18.330> what<00:00:18.570> we're

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
always use a new bottle so what we're

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.700 
always use a new bottle so what we're
going<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.840> do<00:00:18.960> is<00:00:19.109> we're<00:00:19.230> going<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.380> fill<00:00:19.590> the

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
going to do is we're going to fill the

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.279 
going to do is we're going to fill the
reservoir<00:00:20.220> which<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:20.789> currently<00:00:21.090> empty<00:00:21.330> and

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
reservoir which is currently empty and

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.480 
reservoir which is currently empty and
we're<00:00:22.380> going<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.529> start<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:23.189> bleeding

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
we're going to start the bleeding

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.089 
we're going to start the bleeding
process<00:00:23.850> using<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.359> mityvac<00:00:25.019> which<00:00:25.289> is

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
process using a mityvac which is

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.120 
process using a mityvac which is
probably<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.699> most<00:00:26.910> common<00:00:27.590> tool<00:00:28.590> used<00:00:28.710> in

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
probably the most common tool used in

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:36.200 
probably the most common tool used in
bleeding<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:30.000> brake<00:00:30.179> system<00:00:34.910> now<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:35.969> want

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
bleeding the brake system now you want

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.270 
bleeding the brake system now you want
to<00:00:36.270> keep<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.480> reservoir<00:00:36.899> full<00:00:37.739> at<00:00:37.920> all<00:00:38.070> time

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
to keep the reservoir full at all time

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.770 
to keep the reservoir full at all time
so<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.760> don't<00:00:38.910> suck<00:00:39.149> air<00:00:39.360> back<00:00:39.570> down

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
so that you don't suck air back down

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.240 
so that you don't suck air back down
into<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.140> brake<00:00:40.320> lines<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:42.739> yeah<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:44.070> let's

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
into the brake lines and yeah so let's

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.479 
into the brake lines and yeah so let's
begin<00:00:44.430> robert<00:00:45.329> has<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.600> mityvac<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.289> so

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
begin robert has the mityvac and so

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.920 
begin robert has the mityvac and so
we're<00:00:47.489> going<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.670> start<00:00:47.879> off<00:00:48.030> with<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.690> right

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
we're going to start off with the right

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.750 
we're going to start off with the right
side<00:00:49.110> caliper<00:00:49.289> left<00:00:49.710> side<00:00:49.829> Kelly<00:00:50.039> first<00:00:50.610> off

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
side caliper left side Kelly first off

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.799 
side caliper left side Kelly first off
we're<00:00:50.879> going<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.059> start<00:00:51.210> off<00:00:51.329> with<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.629> master

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
we're going to start off with the master

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.299 
we're going to start off with the master
cylinder<00:00:52.050> assist<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.800> master<00:00:53.160> cylinder

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
cylinder assist the master cylinder

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.910 
cylinder assist the master cylinder
hasn't<00:00:53.879> bleed<00:00:54.059> bleed<00:00:54.690> nipple<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.590> let's<00:00:55.800> take

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
hasn't bleed bleed nipple so let's take

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.700 
hasn't bleed bleed nipple so let's take
out<00:00:56.129> all<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.489> air<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:57.000> trapped<00:00:57.870> in<00:00:58.050> at

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
out all the air that is trapped in at

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.639 
out all the air that is trapped in at
the<00:00:59.039> master<00:00:59.340> cylinder<00:00:59.460> first<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.030> we<00:01:00.149> will<00:01:00.649> get

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
the master cylinder first so we will get

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.650 
the master cylinder first so we will get
the<00:01:01.770> master<00:01:01.949> cylinder<00:01:02.190> working<00:01:02.670> properly<00:01:02.910> so

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
the master cylinder working properly so

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.870 
the master cylinder working properly so
we<00:01:03.750> start<00:01:03.870> off<00:01:04.019> by<00:01:04.229> putting<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.619> wrench<00:01:04.880> over

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
we start off by putting the wrench over

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.730 
we start off by putting the wrench over
the<00:01:06.510> bleed<00:01:06.750> nipple<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.290> then<00:01:07.560> you're<00:01:07.650> going

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
the bleed nipple and then you're going

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.320 
the bleed nipple and then you're going
to<00:01:07.830> want<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.040> put<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.280> mityvac<00:01:08.520> hose<00:01:08.850> over<00:01:09.150> top

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
to want to put the mityvac hose over top

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.700 
to want to put the mityvac hose over top
of<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:10.549> create<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.729> suction<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.270> also

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
of that to create the suction and also

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.899 
of that to create the suction and also
suck<00:01:13.710> out<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.100> fluid<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.580> we're<00:01:14.729> going<00:01:14.820> to

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
suck out the fluid that we're going to

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.590 
suck out the fluid that we're going to
be<00:01:15.000> pumping<00:01:15.869> out<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.110> master<00:01:16.409> cylinder<00:01:17.600> so

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
be pumping out of the master cylinder so

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.940 
be pumping out of the master cylinder so
you<00:01:18.689> want<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.900> put<00:01:19.049> some<00:01:19.200> suction<00:01:19.439> on<00:01:19.710> the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
you want to put some suction on the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.010 
you want to put some suction on the
mityvac<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.270> when<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.450> open<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.810> bleed

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
mityvac so that when you open the bleed

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.810 
mityvac so that when you open the bleed
nipple<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.500> will<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.920> will<00:01:22.950> drain<00:01:23.280> fluid<00:01:23.670> out

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
nipple it will it will drain fluid out

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.999 
nipple it will it will drain fluid out
and<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:24.780> once<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.080> fluid<00:01:25.380> starts<00:01:25.560> coming

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
and so once the fluid starts coming

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.719 
and so once the fluid starts coming
through<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.369> hose<00:01:27.740> you've<00:01:28.740> maintained

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
through the hose you've maintained

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.609 
through the hose you've maintained
suction<00:01:30.150> on<00:01:30.240> there<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.990> can<00:01:31.170> close<00:01:31.380> the

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
suction on there you can close the

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.469 
suction on there you can close the
nipple<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.850> always<00:01:33.060> want<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.240> start<00:01:33.329> with

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
nipple you always want to start with

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.749 
nipple you always want to start with
bleeding<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.990> master<00:01:34.290> cylinder<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.100> as

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
bleeding the master cylinder so that as

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:36.980 
bleeding the master cylinder so that as
you<00:01:36.000> get<00:01:36.119> further<00:01:36.299> into<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.689> bleeding

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
you get further into the bleeding

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.350 
you get further into the bleeding
process<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.560> can<00:01:37.710> use<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.790> power<00:01:39.000> that's

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
process you can use the the power that's

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.480 
process you can use the the power that's
used<00:01:39.720> that's<00:01:40.470> exerted<00:01:40.920> by<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.100> master

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
used that's exerted by the master

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.010 
used that's exerted by the master
cylinder<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.939> actually<00:01:42.180> bleed<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.540> system<00:01:42.689> so

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
cylinder to actually bleed the system so

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.819 
cylinder to actually bleed the system so
that's<00:01:43.170> why<00:01:43.290> we<00:01:43.409> always<00:01:43.500> start<00:01:43.710> with<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
that's why we always start with the

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.889 
that's why we always start with the
master<00:01:44.159> cylinder<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:45.240> once<00:01:45.450> that's<00:01:45.600> bled

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
master cylinder and once that's bled

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.410 
master cylinder and once that's bled
then<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.170> can<00:01:46.320> move<00:01:46.439> on<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.890> calipers

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
then you can move on to the calipers

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.429 
then you can move on to the calipers
okay<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.540> so<00:01:48.600> what<00:01:48.780> we've<00:01:48.930> done<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.140> we've

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
okay and so what we've done is we've

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.710 
okay and so what we've done is we've
moved<00:01:49.649> down<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.070> right<00:01:50.250> side<00:01:50.430> caliper

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
moved down to the right side caliper

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.480 
moved down to the right side caliper
you're<00:01:51.720> going<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.899> again<00:01:52.290> use<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.280> wrench

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
you're going to again use the the wrench

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.399 
you're going to again use the the wrench
on<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.759> bleed<00:01:53.939> nipple<00:01:54.240> attach<00:01:54.840> your<00:01:55.020> mityvac

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
on the bleed nipple attach your mityvac

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.929 
on the bleed nipple attach your mityvac
onto<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.860> you're<00:01:56.399> going<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.549> build<00:01:56.790> up

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
onto that you're going to build up

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.030 
onto that you're going to build up
pressure<00:01:57.119> by<00:01:57.450> pumping<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.899> lever<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.829> then

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
pressure by pumping the lever and then

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.740 
pressure by pumping the lever and then
you're<00:01:59.130> going<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.280> crack<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.700> bleeder<00:02:02.600> as<00:02:03.600> you

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
you're going to crack the bleeder as you

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.389 
you're going to crack the bleeder as you
can<00:02:03.869> see<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.259> fluid<00:02:04.649> is<00:02:04.770> coming<00:02:04.920> up<00:02:05.189> through

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
can see the fluid is coming up through

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.700 
can see the fluid is coming up through
here<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.960> that's<00:02:06.960> how<00:02:07.079> we<00:02:07.140> know<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.560> the

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
here and that's how we know that the

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:15.150 
here and that's how we know that the
fluid<00:02:07.920> has<00:02:08.069> traveled<00:02:08.399> through<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.610> line

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.839 

and<00:02:16.160> then<00:02:16.250> you're<00:02:16.340> going<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:16.489> want<00:02:16.610> to<00:02:16.670> close

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
and then you're going to want to close

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.309 
and then you're going to want to close
the<00:02:16.970> nipple<00:02:17.239> back<00:02:17.390> up<00:02:17.569> once<00:02:17.780> you've<00:02:17.900> had<00:02:18.050> fluid

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
the nipple back up once you've had fluid

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:26.020 
the nipple back up once you've had fluid
coming<00:02:18.620> through<00:02:24.520> and<00:02:25.520> then<00:02:25.760> we're<00:02:25.880> going<00:02:25.970> to

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
coming through and then we're going to

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.930 
coming through and then we're going to
move<00:02:26.090> to<00:02:26.239> the<00:02:26.330> left<00:02:26.450> side<00:02:27.400> same<00:02:28.400> process<00:02:28.819> on

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
move to the left side same process on

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.009 
move to the left side same process on
the<00:02:29.000> left<00:02:29.239> side<00:02:29.360> that<00:02:29.540> you<00:02:29.599> have<00:02:29.720> with<00:02:29.930> the

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
the left side that you have with the

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.470 
the left side that you have with the
right<00:02:30.170> side<00:02:30.430> put<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:31.519> wrench<00:02:31.700> on<00:02:31.910> build

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
right side put the wrench on build

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.930 
right side put the wrench on build
pressure<00:02:32.690> in<00:02:33.080> the<00:02:33.170> mag<00:02:33.319> evac<00:02:33.620> and<00:02:33.860> then<00:02:34.670> crack

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
pressure in the mag evac and then crack

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.229 
pressure in the mag evac and then crack
the<00:02:35.090> bleeder<00:02:37.420> you'll<00:02:38.420> get<00:02:38.540> fluid<00:02:38.930> coming<00:02:39.170> out

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
the bleeder you'll get fluid coming out

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.640 
the bleeder you'll get fluid coming out
and<00:02:41.239> after<00:02:41.420> fluids<00:02:41.900> been<00:02:42.050> coming<00:02:42.290> out<00:02:42.380> for<00:02:42.620> a

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
and after fluids been coming out for a

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.170 
and after fluids been coming out for a
few<00:02:42.890> moments<00:02:43.120> you<00:02:44.120> can<00:02:44.269> close<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:44.600> bleeder<00:02:46.180> so

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
few moments you can close the bleeder so

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.550 
few moments you can close the bleeder so
like<00:02:47.330> when<00:02:47.450> we<00:02:47.540> first<00:02:47.720> started<00:02:48.140> we<00:02:48.170> have<00:02:48.380> the

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
like when we first started we have the

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.170 
like when we first started we have the
reservoir<00:02:49.010> full<00:02:49.250> so<00:02:49.489> again<00:02:49.700> we're<00:02:50.000> going<00:02:50.120> to

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
reservoir full so again we're going to

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.490 
reservoir full so again we're going to
put<00:02:50.299> some<00:02:50.360> more<00:02:50.569> food<00:02:50.750> in<00:02:50.930> there<00:02:51.080> just<00:02:51.200> to<00:02:51.350> make

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
put some more food in there just to make

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.930 
put some more food in there just to make
sure<00:02:51.530> that<00:02:51.860> as<00:02:52.160> we<00:02:52.370> continue<00:02:52.760> to<00:02:52.850> believe

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
sure that as we continue to believe

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.670 
sure that as we continue to believe
process<00:02:53.510> we<00:02:53.690> don't<00:02:53.840> have<00:02:53.959> to<00:02:54.049> stop<00:02:54.290> it<00:02:54.470> at<00:02:54.560> any

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
process we don't have to stop it at any

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.039 
process we don't have to stop it at any
certain<00:02:54.890> point<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:55.760> make<00:02:56.209> make<00:02:56.810> sure<00:02:56.900> that

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
certain point to make make sure that

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:58.000 
certain point to make make sure that
there's<00:02:57.230> enough<00:02:57.290> food<00:02:57.560> in<00:02:57.680> there<00:02:57.830> so<00:02:57.920> we're

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
there's enough food in there so we're

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.890 
there's enough food in there so we're
going<00:02:58.130> to<00:02:58.190> fill<00:02:58.340> it<00:02:58.370> up<00:02:58.489> one<00:02:58.670> more<00:02:58.700> time<00:02:58.900> to

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
going to fill it up one more time to

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.089 
going to fill it up one more time to
make<00:03:00.019> sure<00:03:00.170> we've<00:03:00.349> got<00:03:00.380> enough<00:03:00.500> for<00:03:00.830> the<00:03:00.920> rest

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
make sure we've got enough for the rest

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:03.370 
make sure we've got enough for the rest
of<00:03:01.190> the<00:03:01.280> job<00:03:01.489> like<00:03:02.420> I<00:03:02.510> said<00:03:02.690> before<00:03:02.780> once<00:03:03.200> now

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
of the job like I said before once now

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.140 
of the job like I said before once now
that<00:03:03.739> we<00:03:03.830> have<00:03:03.860> fluid<00:03:04.400> inside<00:03:04.549> the<00:03:04.790> system

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
that we have fluid inside the system

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.580 
that we have fluid inside the system
we're<00:03:05.299> going<00:03:05.420> to<00:03:05.480> go<00:03:05.599> back<00:03:05.810> and<00:03:05.840> actually<00:03:06.140> pump

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
we're going to go back and actually pump

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:07.990 
we're going to go back and actually pump
with<00:03:06.890> the<00:03:07.040> master<00:03:07.220> cylinder<00:03:07.459> and<00:03:07.730> not<00:03:07.880> the

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
with the master cylinder and not the

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000 
with the master cylinder and not the
mityvac<00:03:08.299> the<00:03:08.840> mityvac<00:03:09.140> is<00:03:09.440> just<00:03:09.650> here<00:03:09.890> to

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
mityvac the mityvac is just here to

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.309 
mityvac the mityvac is just here to
catch<00:03:10.190> all<00:03:10.519> the<00:03:11.000> brake<00:03:11.180> fluid<00:03:11.510> going<00:03:11.720> into<00:03:12.019> the

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
catch all the brake fluid going into the

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.920 
catch all the brake fluid going into the
reservoir<00:03:13.390> so<00:03:14.390> we're<00:03:14.510> going<00:03:14.600> to<00:03:14.690> pump<00:03:14.840> the

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
reservoir so we're going to pump the

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.440 
reservoir so we're going to pump the
lever<00:03:15.109> a<00:03:15.200> few<00:03:15.410> times<00:03:15.650> build<00:03:16.459> up<00:03:16.579> some<00:03:16.730> pressure

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.310 

and<00:03:20.450> then<00:03:20.630> we're<00:03:20.720> going<00:03:20.810> to<00:03:20.870> hold<00:03:21.049> the<00:03:21.140> lever

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
and then we're going to hold the lever

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:27.309 
and then we're going to hold the lever
down<00:03:25.540> and<00:03:26.540> then<00:03:26.690> we're<00:03:26.810> going<00:03:26.900> to<00:03:26.959> crack<00:03:27.170> the

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
down and then we're going to crack the

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.000 
down and then we're going to crack the
bleeder

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.039 

you<00:03:30.640> can<00:03:30.760> see<00:03:30.970> air<00:03:31.120> bubbles<00:03:31.450> coming<00:03:31.689> out<00:03:31.810> and

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
you can see air bubbles coming out and

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:33.990 
you can see air bubbles coming out and
once<00:03:32.260> you<00:03:32.379> have<00:03:32.560> air<00:03:33.430> bubbles<00:03:33.730> coming<00:03:33.939> out

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
once you have air bubbles coming out

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.780 
once you have air bubbles coming out
you're<00:03:34.150> going<00:03:34.239> to<00:03:34.299> want<00:03:34.420> to<00:03:34.510> close<00:03:34.720> it<00:03:34.870> back<00:03:34.989> up

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.610 

and<00:03:39.790> before<00:03:40.599> you<00:03:40.840> let<00:03:40.989> go<00:03:41.140> of<00:03:41.260> the<00:03:41.319> lever<00:03:41.500> you

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
and before you let go of the lever you

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.610 
and before you let go of the lever you
want<00:03:41.739> to<00:03:41.799> make<00:03:41.920> sure<00:03:41.950> that<00:03:42.069> that<00:03:42.310> is<00:03:42.489> tight<00:03:43.620> now

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
want to make sure that that is tight now

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.319 
want to make sure that that is tight now
it's<00:03:44.769> tight<00:03:44.980> you<00:03:45.129> let<00:03:45.280> go<00:03:45.400> of<00:03:45.519> the<00:03:45.579> lever<00:03:45.760> we're

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
it's tight you let go of the lever we're

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:53.059 
it's tight you let go of the lever we're
going<00:03:46.420> to<00:03:46.510> pump<00:03:46.690> it<00:03:46.780> a<00:03:46.840> couple<00:03:46.959> more<00:03:47.200> times

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.920 

usually<00:03:54.069> about<00:03:54.400> 10<00:03:54.610> or<00:03:54.760> 12<00:03:55.000> times<00:03:55.180> and<00:03:55.540> then

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
usually about 10 or 12 times and then

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.259 
usually about 10 or 12 times and then
we're<00:03:56.019> going<00:03:56.109> to<00:03:56.170> hold<00:03:56.319> the<00:03:56.409> lever<00:03:56.620> again

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
we're going to hold the lever again

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.259 
we're going to hold the lever again
crack<00:03:58.269> the<00:03:58.299> bleeder<00:03:58.659> again<00:04:00.030> and<00:04:01.030> once<00:04:01.180> again

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
crack the bleeder again and once again

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:02.490 
crack the bleeder again and once again
you've<00:04:01.480> got<00:04:01.599> more<00:04:01.720> air<00:04:01.900> bubbles<00:04:02.230> and<00:04:02.379> then

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
you've got more air bubbles and then

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.960 
you've got more air bubbles and then
once<00:04:02.680> you've<00:04:03.250> cracked<00:04:03.489> it<00:04:03.670> you<00:04:03.760> want<00:04:03.909> to

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
once you've cracked it you want to

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.360 
once you've cracked it you want to
tighten<00:04:04.209> it<00:04:04.299> back<00:04:04.329> up<00:04:04.950> let<00:04:05.950> go<00:04:06.069> the<00:04:06.190> lever

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
tighten it back up let go the lever

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.770 
tighten it back up let go the lever
we're<00:04:06.579> going<00:04:06.700> to<00:04:06.760> pump<00:04:06.940> it<00:04:07.030> again<00:04:07.299> you<00:04:07.720> should

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
we're going to pump it again you should

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.360 
we're going to pump it again you should
start<00:04:08.139> feeling<00:04:08.470> a<00:04:08.560> little<00:04:08.739> pressure<00:04:08.980> building

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
start feeling a little pressure building

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.509 
start feeling a little pressure building
up<00:04:09.489> in<00:04:09.670> the<00:04:09.700> master<00:04:10.060> cylinder<00:04:10.799> and<00:04:11.799> then<00:04:12.280> once

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
up in the master cylinder and then once

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.250 
up in the master cylinder and then once
there<00:04:12.760> you<00:04:12.940> use<00:04:13.299> the<00:04:13.420> mityvac<00:04:13.690> to<00:04:13.959> keep<00:04:14.109> the

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
there you use the mityvac to keep the

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.590 
there you use the mityvac to keep the
vacuum<00:04:14.409> and<00:04:14.769> suck<00:04:14.950> the<00:04:15.040> fluid<00:04:15.370> out<00:04:15.459> and<00:04:16.329> then

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
vacuum and suck the fluid out and then

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.140 
vacuum and suck the fluid out and then
you<00:04:16.780> can<00:04:16.989> break<00:04:17.560> it<00:04:17.680> off<00:04:17.769> of<00:04:17.949> the<00:04:18.010> nipple<00:04:18.280> and

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.460 

then<00:04:22.150> from<00:04:22.300> that<00:04:22.330> point<00:04:22.479> we<00:04:22.810> can<00:04:22.960> move<00:04:23.110> on<00:04:23.289> to

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
then from that point we can move on to

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:24.779 
then from that point we can move on to
the<00:04:23.560> calipers<00:04:23.979> again<00:04:24.310> so<00:04:24.520> we're<00:04:24.610> going<00:04:24.699> to

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
the calipers again so we're going to

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:27.480 
the calipers again so we're going to
start<00:04:24.970> again<00:04:25.180> at<00:04:25.210> the<00:04:25.419> right<00:04:25.630> side<00:04:25.810> caliper<00:04:26.490> so

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
start again at the right side caliper so

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:28.830 
start again at the right side caliper so
now<00:04:27.610> you're<00:04:27.729> going<00:04:27.880> to<00:04:27.940> once<00:04:28.180> again<00:04:28.300> build<00:04:28.720> up

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
now you're going to once again build up

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.570 
now you're going to once again build up
pressure<00:04:28.930> with<00:04:29.229> the<00:04:29.260> master<00:04:29.500> cylinder<00:04:29.710> by

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
pressure with the master cylinder by

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.629 
pressure with the master cylinder by
pumping<00:04:30.789> a<00:04:31.000> few<00:04:31.150> times<00:04:32.310> and<00:04:33.310> then<00:04:33.550> you're

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 
pumping a few times and then you're

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:34.830 
pumping a few times and then you're
going<00:04:33.729> to<00:04:33.789> hold<00:04:33.970> the<00:04:34.090> pressure<00:04:34.300> on<00:04:34.539> the<00:04:34.660> lever

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
going to hold the pressure on the lever

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.020 
going to hold the pressure on the lever
while<00:04:35.320> cracking<00:04:35.680> the<00:04:35.770> bleeder<00:04:35.979> you<00:04:36.669> can<00:04:36.820> see

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
while cracking the bleeder you can see

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.460 
while cracking the bleeder you can see
fluid<00:04:37.449> and<00:04:37.630> bubbles<00:04:37.960> coming<00:04:38.229> out<00:04:38.289> of<00:04:38.349> the

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
fluid and bubbles coming out of the

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.860 
fluid and bubbles coming out of the
caliper<00:04:38.940> tighten<00:04:39.940> the<00:04:40.060> bleed<00:04:40.449> nipple<00:04:40.750> one

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
caliper tighten the bleed nipple one

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.750 
caliper tighten the bleed nipple one
more<00:04:41.020> time<00:04:41.229> and<00:04:42.010> then<00:04:42.070> you're<00:04:42.400> gonna<00:04:42.490> let<00:04:42.639> go

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
more time and then you're gonna let go

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.939 
more time and then you're gonna let go
the<00:04:42.940> lever<00:04:43.150> pump<00:04:43.750> it<00:04:43.870> again<00:04:44.110> and<00:04:44.289> again<00:04:44.650> you

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:44.949 
the lever pump it again and again you

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:46.589 
the lever pump it again and again you
should<00:04:45.010> feel<00:04:45.340> pressure<00:04:45.940> building<00:04:46.270> up<00:04:46.389> through

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:46.599 
should feel pressure building up through

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:50.700 
should feel pressure building up through
the<00:04:46.690> master<00:04:46.870> cylinder<00:04:48.510> so<00:04:49.510> we<00:04:49.660> pump

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
the master cylinder so we pump

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.960 
the master cylinder so we pump
then<00:04:51.370> we<00:04:51.490> hold<00:04:51.700> pressure<00:04:52.060> crack<00:04:52.870> again

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
then we hold pressure crack again

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.120 
then we hold pressure crack again
tighten<00:04:54.970> the<00:04:55.060> bleeder<00:04:55.300> and<00:04:55.810> then<00:04:56.800> let's<00:04:56.950> do<00:04:57.040> it

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
tighten the bleeder and then let's do it

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.780 
tighten the bleeder and then let's do it
one<00:04:57.250> more<00:04:57.280> time<00:04:57.430> reading<00:04:58.120> pump<00:04:59.700> building<00:05:00.700> up

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
one more time reading pump building up

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.730 
one more time reading pump building up
pressure<00:05:00.940> building<00:05:01.420> up<00:05:01.510> pressure<00:05:01.660> and<00:05:02.110> then

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
pressure building up pressure and then

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.120 
pressure building up pressure and then
we<00:05:02.860> hold<00:05:03.070> it<00:05:03.220> crack<00:05:03.970> the<00:05:04.120> bleeder<00:05:05.070> tighten<00:05:06.070> the

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
we hold it crack the bleeder tighten the

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.050 
we hold it crack the bleeder tighten the
bleeder<00:05:07.530> and<00:05:08.530> you're<00:05:08.980> all<00:05:09.100> good<00:05:09.340> now<00:05:09.760> use<00:05:09.970> the

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
bleeder and you're all good now use the

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.730 
bleeder and you're all good now use the
mityvac<00:05:10.330> to<00:05:10.630> set<00:05:10.870> the<00:05:10.990> fluid<00:05:11.260> out<00:05:11.350> of<00:05:11.380> the<00:05:11.560> hose

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
mityvac to set the fluid out of the hose

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.420 
mityvac to set the fluid out of the hose
and<00:05:13.380> now<00:05:14.380> we<00:05:14.440> move<00:05:14.650> over<00:05:14.800> to<00:05:14.950> the<00:05:15.160> left<00:05:15.310> side

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
and now we move over to the left side

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.570 
and now we move over to the left side
caliber<00:05:16.740> so<00:05:17.740> now<00:05:17.860> at<00:05:17.890> the<00:05:18.040> left<00:05:18.220> side<00:05:18.280> caliper

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
caliber so now at the left side caliper

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.190 
caliber so now at the left side caliper
we're<00:05:18.880> going<00:05:19.000> to<00:05:19.060> do<00:05:19.180> the<00:05:19.300> same<00:05:19.480> thing<00:05:19.780> you're

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200 
we're going to do the same thing you're

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.310 
we're going to do the same thing you're
going<00:05:20.320> to<00:05:20.380> reach<00:05:20.560> across<00:05:20.800> the<00:05:21.100> bike<00:05:22.320> Roberts

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
bubbles tighten the bleeder once it's

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.800 
bubbles tighten the bleeder once it's
tight<00:05:36.690> you<00:05:37.690> can<00:05:37.810> pump<00:05:38.050> again<00:05:39.600> and<00:05:40.600> already

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
tight you can pump again and already

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.490 
tight you can pump again and already
feel<00:05:41.050> the<00:05:41.080> lever<00:05:41.350> getting<00:05:41.620> really<00:05:41.830> stiff<00:05:43.500> so

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
feel the lever getting really stiff so

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.530

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:57.930 
tighten the bleeder and back to the
lever<00:05:52.120> pumping<00:05:52.510> it<00:05:52.630> again<00:05:56.250> all<00:05:57.250> right<00:05:57.520> last

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
lever pumping it again all right last

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:04.020 
lever pumping it again all right last
time

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.310 

now<00:06:05.030> you<00:06:05.090> should<00:06:05.180> continue<00:06:05.750> back<00:06:05.930> and<00:06:06.110> forth

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:06.320 
now you should continue back and forth

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.620 
now you should continue back and forth
to<00:06:06.470> the<00:06:06.530> left<00:06:06.740> and<00:06:06.860> right<00:06:06.920> calipers<00:06:07.510> until<00:06:08.510> you

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:08.630 
to the left and right calipers until you

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.300 
to the left and right calipers until you
have<00:06:08.810> no<00:06:09.080> air<00:06:09.380> bubbles<00:06:09.560> coming<00:06:10.010> out<00:06:10.100> of<00:06:10.160> the

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
have no air bubbles coming out of the

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.450 
have no air bubbles coming out of the
line<00:06:10.630> and<00:06:11.630> once<00:06:11.930> that<00:06:11.990> happens<00:06:12.280> you're<00:06:13.280> good

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460 
line and once that happens you're good

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.280 
line and once that happens you're good
to<00:06:13.640> go<00:06:13.670> I<00:06:14.000> want<00:06:14.360> to<00:06:14.450> make<00:06:14.540> sure<00:06:14.570> that<00:06:14.930> the<00:06:15.080> fluid

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:15.290 
to go I want to make sure that the fluid

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.260 
to go I want to make sure that the fluid
and<00:06:15.500> the<00:06:15.530> reservoir<00:06:16.010> is<00:06:16.190> still<00:06:16.430> it<00:06:16.610> in<00:06:16.880> between

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270 
and the reservoir is still it in between

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.470 
and the reservoir is still it in between
its<00:06:17.600> minimum<00:06:17.930> maximum<00:06:18.170> we<00:06:19.100> usually<00:06:19.390> set<00:06:20.390> it

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:20.480 
its minimum maximum we usually set it

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.450 
its minimum maximum we usually set it
right<00:06:20.600> in<00:06:20.750> the<00:06:20.840> middle<00:06:21.020> of<00:06:21.170> the<00:06:21.320> two<00:06:21.500> and<00:06:22.340> then

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
right in the middle of the two and then

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.820 
right in the middle of the two and then
you<00:06:22.580> can<00:06:22.840> put<00:06:23.840> the<00:06:23.930> cap<00:06:24.140> back<00:06:24.170> on<00:06:24.530> make<00:06:24.800> sure

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:24.830 
you can put the cap back on make sure

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.980 
you can put the cap back on make sure
that<00:06:25.100> you<00:06:25.160> have<00:06:25.340> your<00:06:25.370> your<00:06:26.150> rubber<00:06:26.360> seal<00:06:26.690> over

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:26.990 
that you have your your rubber seal over

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.380 
that you have your your rubber seal over
the<00:06:27.110> top<00:06:27.290> and<00:06:27.500> screw<00:06:28.100> it<00:06:28.220> back<00:06:28.340> on<00:06:28.400> and<00:06:28.760> that's

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:29.390 
the top and screw it back on and that's

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.240 
the top and screw it back on and that's
bleeding<00:06:29.690> your<00:06:29.900> brakes<00:06:30.080> so<00:06:30.950> we're<00:06:31.100> putting

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.250 
bleeding your brakes so we're putting

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.460 
bleeding your brakes so we're putting
back<00:06:31.550> on<00:06:31.790> the<00:06:32.060> the<00:06:32.450> reservoir<00:06:32.870> cap<00:06:33.080> you've<00:06:33.290> got

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:33.470 
back on the the reservoir cap you've got

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.140 
back on the the reservoir cap you've got
your<00:06:33.880> your<00:06:34.880> rubber<00:06:35.090> cap<00:06:35.390> and<00:06:35.960> then<00:06:36.380> you've<00:06:36.530> got

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.150 
your your rubber cap and then you've got

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:41.440 
your your rubber cap and then you've got
sealing<00:06:38.150> cap<00:06:39.670> and<00:06:40.670> once<00:06:40.850> that's<00:06:40.970> on<00:06:41.180> you

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:41.450 
sealing cap and once that's on you

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.170 
sealing cap and once that's on you
usually<00:06:41.630> have<00:06:41.870> two<00:06:42.110> screws<00:06:42.440> now<00:06:43.070> again<00:06:43.700> the

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.180 
usually have two screws now again the

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.670 
usually have two screws now again the
reason<00:06:44.330> that<00:06:44.540> we<00:06:44.600> leave<00:06:44.780> the<00:06:44.990> fluid<00:06:45.410> level

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 
reason that we leave the fluid level

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.930 
reason that we leave the fluid level
halfway<00:06:46.070> and<00:06:46.220> you<00:06:46.340> have<00:06:46.460> some<00:06:46.640> room<00:06:46.790> for

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:46.940 
halfway and you have some room for

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.300 
halfway and you have some room for
expansion<00:06:47.270> is<00:06:47.630> that<00:06:48.200> so<00:06:48.380> one<00:06:48.620> as<00:06:48.830> the<00:06:48.980> system

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:49.310 
expansion is that so one as the system

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:50.710 
expansion is that so one as the system
gets<00:06:49.490> hot<00:06:49.640> there's<00:06:49.970> room<00:06:50.210> for<00:06:50.240> the<00:06:50.540> brake

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 
gets hot there's room for the brake

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.420 
gets hot there's room for the brake
fluid<00:06:51.080> to<00:06:51.230> move<00:06:51.380> back<00:06:51.560> up<00:06:51.620> through<00:06:52.070> into<00:06:52.340> the

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:52.430 
fluid to move back up through into the

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.570 
fluid to move back up through into the
reservoir<00:06:52.600> and<00:06:53.600> it<00:06:54.020> creates<00:06:54.590> a<00:06:54.680> creates<00:06:55.310> room

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:55.580 
reservoir and it creates a creates room

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.160 
reservoir and it creates a creates room
so<00:06:55.760> that<00:06:55.790> your<00:06:55.940> brakes<00:06:56.210> don't<00:06:56.450> drag<00:06:56.690> it's

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:57.170 
so that your brakes don't drag it's

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:58.150 
so that your brakes don't drag it's
something<00:06:57.380> that<00:06:57.590> we<00:06:57.650> also<00:06:57.800> recommend

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160 
something that we also recommend

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.680 
something that we also recommend
whenever<00:06:58.610> you're<00:06:58.790> changing<00:06:59.180> your<00:06:59.300> brake<00:06:59.450> pads

00:06:59.680 --> 00:06:59.690 
whenever you're changing your brake pads

and<00:07:01.820> are<00:07:01.940> putting<00:07:02.180> it<00:07:02.300> back<00:07:02.390> in<00:07:02.630> you<00:07:03.110> want<00:07:03.290> to

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:03.380 
and are putting it back in you want to

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:04.660 
and are putting it back in you want to
make<00:07:03.470> sure<00:07:03.500> that<00:07:03.800> the<00:07:03.890> brake<00:07:04.070> fluid<00:07:04.460> level

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:04.670 
make sure that the brake fluid level

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:05.920 
make sure that the brake fluid level
isn't<00:07:04.820> too<00:07:05.090> high<00:07:05.240> because<00:07:05.450> what's<00:07:05.720> going<00:07:05.870> to

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:05.930 
isn't too high because what's going to

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:07.900 
isn't too high because what's going to
happen<00:07:06.200> is<00:07:06.320> as<00:07:06.470> you<00:07:07.070> start<00:07:07.310> writing<00:07:07.460> and<00:07:07.820> your

you're doing any time you're doing
anything<00:07:26.030> with<00:07:26.240> the<00:07:26.330> brakes<00:07:26.540> whether<00:07:26.750> it's

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:26.930 
anything with the brakes whether it's

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.170 
anything with the brakes whether it's
changing<00:07:27.260> pads<00:07:27.500> or<00:07:27.830> you<00:07:28.430> know<00:07:28.520> like<00:07:28.880> we<00:07:29.000> just

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:29.180 
changing pads or you know like we just

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.430 
changing pads or you know like we just
did<00:07:29.240> with<00:07:29.480> bleeding<00:07:29.690> the<00:07:29.840> system<00:07:30.140> you<00:07:30.230> want<00:07:30.350> to

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:30.440 
did with bleeding the system you want to

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:35.940 
did with bleeding the system you want to
make<00:07:30.530> sure<00:07:30.560> that<00:07:30.800> it's<00:07:30.950> not<00:07:31.070> too<00:07:31.340> high

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:35.950 

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.100 

we<00:07:36.550> recommend<00:07:37.000> that<00:07:37.120> you<00:07:37.270> test<00:07:37.510> the<00:07:37.720> system

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:38.110 
we recommend that you test the system

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:40.320 
we recommend that you test the system
overnight<00:07:38.530> or<00:07:38.830> at<00:07:38.920> least<00:07:39.100> for<00:07:39.280> a<00:07:39.310> few<00:07:39.370> hours<00:07:39.580> so

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:40.330 
overnight or at least for a few hours so

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:41.580 
overnight or at least for a few hours so
what<00:07:40.480> we<00:07:40.570> recommend<00:07:40.750> by<00:07:41.050> doing<00:07:41.290> that<00:07:41.410> by

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:41.590 
what we recommend by doing that by

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:43.110 
what we recommend by doing that by
putting<00:07:41.770> pressure<00:07:42.010> on<00:07:42.130> the<00:07:42.280> system<00:07:42.460> is<00:07:42.970> you

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:43.120 
putting pressure on the system is you

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.540 
putting pressure on the system is you
want<00:07:43.270> to<00:07:43.330> keep<00:07:43.420> your<00:07:43.570> master<00:07:43.870> cylinder

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:44.550 
want to keep your master cylinder

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:46.440 
want to keep your master cylinder
pressure<00:07:45.550> on<00:07:45.700> the<00:07:45.760> master<00:07:46.000> cylinder<00:07:46.120> by

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:46.450 
pressure on the master cylinder by

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:48.360 
pressure on the master cylinder by
holding<00:07:46.750> the<00:07:46.840> lever<00:07:47.020> and<00:07:47.410> then<00:07:47.770> you're<00:07:48.280> going

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:48.370 
holding the lever and then you're going

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:50.790 
holding the lever and then you're going
to<00:07:48.430> want<00:07:48.580> to<00:07:48.700> zip<00:07:48.850> tie<00:07:49.060> it<00:07:49.120> to<00:07:49.960> your<00:07:49.990> to<00:07:50.770> your

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:50.800 
to want to zip tie it to your to your

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.090 
to want to zip tie it to your to your
handlebar<00:07:52.410> like<00:07:53.410> I<00:07:53.470> said<00:07:53.620> if<00:07:53.710> you<00:07:53.800> can<00:07:53.890> do<00:07:53.980> that

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:54.100 
handlebar like I said if you can do that

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.580 
handlebar like I said if you can do that
for<00:07:54.220> a<00:07:54.280> few<00:07:54.460> hours<00:07:54.520> or<00:07:54.940> even<00:07:54.970> overnight<00:07:55.590> just

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:56.590 
for a few hours or even overnight just

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:57.660 
for a few hours or even overnight just
leave<00:07:56.740> it<00:07:56.770> zip<00:07:57.010> tied<00:07:57.190> like<00:07:57.310> that<00:07:57.490> and<00:07:57.580> that

00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:57.670 
leave it zip tied like that and that

00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:59.370 
leave it zip tied like that and that
will<00:07:57.760> maintain<00:07:57.910> pressure<00:07:58.270> on<00:07:58.450> the<00:07:58.540> system<00:07:58.720> you

00:07:59.370 --> 00:07:59.380 
will maintain pressure on the system you

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:00.570 
will maintain pressure on the system you
can<00:07:59.530> make<00:07:59.650> sure<00:07:59.800> that<00:07:59.980> you<00:08:00.070> don't<00:08:00.250> have<00:08:00.430> any

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:00.580 
can make sure that you don't have any

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.420 
can make sure that you don't have any
leaks<00:08:00.850> either<00:08:01.120> from<00:08:01.630> the<00:08:01.810> from<00:08:02.440> the<00:08:02.470> bolts<00:08:02.920> or

at the master cylinder or at the caliper
you<00:08:07.690> just<00:08:07.840> want<00:08:07.960> to<00:08:07.990> make<00:08:08.110> sure<00:08:08.170> that

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:08.440 
you just want to make sure that

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.620 
you just want to make sure that
everything<00:08:08.650> is<00:08:09.280> tightened<00:08:09.520> down<00:08:09.670> to<00:08:10.030> what<00:08:10.510> we

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:10.630 
everything is tightened down to what we
