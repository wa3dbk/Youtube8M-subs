00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:09.210
 today a recipe is really 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.990
 the cacciucco is spectacular 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:16.800
 livornese then scorpion fish soup 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.199
 fish priest sails San Pietro fish 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.000
 parrot cicadas all fish that 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.859
 fundamentally it is not of great value 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.560
 especially for the size 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:33.109
 but how do we start oil a couple of wedges 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.109
 but we also make three cloves of garlic 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:47.190
 we put 5 leaves even if of sage 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:49.200
 let's brown a little, let's get closer 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.500
 the tomato in this case I'm 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.590
 using the peeled tomato lo 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.190
 we cut to pieces just that we give you 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:05.329
 so that you don't have it in the pieces 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.329
 too big in this tomato 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.420
 I normally use tomatoes 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:15.620
 peeled this one he taught me 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:19.280
 lady from Livorno but also told me 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.900
 that can only be done with del 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.870
 tomato paste is a choice 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.230
 so let's put on the chilli 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.230
 here it is 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.520
 let it cook for a few minutes 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.750
 in case we can also to speed up a 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.660
 bit the cooking cover and in the meantime 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.920
 we begin to choose our fish 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:46.370
 we will start from the slightly more leathery fish 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.710
 as this case here the monkfish and 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.930
 the fish priest and then gradually we will put 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.970
 the other fishes of us put it 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.130
 whole naturally there are so many 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.880
 versions there is also who spi read it that 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:01.399
 remove the thorns but keep in mind that 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.289
 which in any case has a lot of flavor here 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.770
 as some Livornese say with the 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:09.920
 cacciucco must spit we put 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.390
 the priest fish is not added yet 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.890
 this time here the liquid therefore it 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.890
 let's make this fish brown 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.569
 here arrived at this point that the 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:24.650
 rolled fish a little we go to 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:26.269
 take the wine and for the wine cacciucco 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.599
 red 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:33.680
 here we leave at this point the 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:37.120
 uncovered pot in such a way as to make 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.120
 evaporate all the alcohol 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:43.280
 at this point we must 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:48.370
 add a little water let's put some 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:52.849
 of salt and now we cover to bring back 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:57.799
 our football almost boiling 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:03:00.940
 let's check and smell this point 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:03.109
 we can move on this little other 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.450
 we can even keep it lower because 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:11.359
 so now the temperature was taken and 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:13.700
 now we dedicate ourselves to bread and it 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:17.389
 bruschetti is fine as you see it 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:22.010
 sliced ​​a little higher because then 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:23.569
 once casey suppa become 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.500
 even better as you see I am 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:30.340
 putting the fish for 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.430
 speed of cooking here Peter must not 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.750
 boil too violently must be 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.970
 made it boil because the fish didn't 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:41.640
 it must crush our slices perfectly 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:43.780
 of bread 61 bruschetta ndaw we check 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:48.010
 look at how wonderful this is 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:54.610
 we continue and put the other two 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:59.739
 big fish trying to make room for them 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:01.690
 because it is really very appeal goes down 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.510
 now they remain to be inserted only 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:07.510
 the cicadas that we will not engrave 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.400
 we will leave hunter and because it is anyway 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.579
 very good 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:16.449
 the pulp of cicadas 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:18.639
 here we put them on but that's it 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:21.549
 true they are more than enough 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:26.919
 see you in a few minutes 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:29.919
 then let's take the year and rub it 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:35.729
 just fine over the 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:38.949
 our muskets this finished piece 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:44.470
 let's check our football 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:45.699
 my mother, what a wonder now 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.729
 best would be to be able to 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:50.020
 let you let it rest 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:51.580
 at least half an hour 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:56.729
 of course it's not that you can wait 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:05:03.750
 so much and let's start implanting here 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:03.750
 here is the redfish enjoy the scalta 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.930
 let's go with this incredible sauce 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:21.360
 we put all our slices around 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:24.950
 of bread to the ato and our cacciucco 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.950
