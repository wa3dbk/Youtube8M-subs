 Hello de la reine today 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.840
 we have a review on ipod shuffle 4g two 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.820
 gig version of what we have in 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.420
 kit well this is such a box it is very 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.849
 interestingly comes in plastic so 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.200
 we will not even hide any further of course 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.020
 same instruction but it is in English 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.450
 cable that connects to 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.309
 three-meter output and start earphone 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.360
 by the way very good music is playing 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.160
 just superbly average price of this player 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.309
 in Russia two two and a half thousand 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.250
 rubles this player is very convenient 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.469
 very good as in sport and 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.360
 just if you want to listen to music by 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.620
 the street but no matter where it will be 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.100
 decide for yourself this player will support the function 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.519
 you 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.840
 but because it doesnâ€™t have a owaissa screen 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.479
 war notifies us 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.119
 about the charge of percent this is this button 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.509
 Here we click on it in the headphones 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.600
 well say interest charge or name 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.970
 playlist is all twenty five languages 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.250
 World supports including 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.280
 Russian 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:29.340
 what else can I say the player turns on 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.960
 this one here 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.619
 often at the moment we are off 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.340
 he also has a charge indicator 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.500
 batteries 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.530
 now we have a harem at the moment 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.750
 red that charge is very weak well 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.810
 if it is lit in red, it is clear that 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.340
 he sat on green means charged this 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.430
 the button is responsible for turning on 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.439
 shutdown also will depend 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.439

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.680

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:01.920

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.479

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.650
