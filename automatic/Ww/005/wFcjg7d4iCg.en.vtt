00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
figure is to kind of measure everything

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.949 
figure is to kind of measure everything
out<00:01:48.099> so<00:01:48.369> so<00:01:48.670> it<00:01:48.819> works<00:01:49.149> out<00:01:49.300> evenly<00:01:49.720> for

00:01:49.949 --> 00:01:49.959 
out so so it works out evenly for

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:51.690 
out so so it works out evenly for

instance over here I'm going to put a

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.859 
instance over here I'm going to put a
line<00:01:52.110> for<00:01:53.110> the<00:01:53.200> elbow<00:01:53.670> now<00:01:54.670> of<00:01:55.479> course<00:01:55.660> I've

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
line for the elbow now of course I've

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.449 
line for the elbow now of course I've
already<00:01:56.110> committed<00:01:56.649> myself<00:01:56.950> to<00:01:57.340> that

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
distance I have to sort of match it up

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.350 
distance I have to sort of match it up
on<00:01:59.170> this<00:01:59.289> side<00:01:59.349> don't<00:01:59.800> I<00:01:59.920> so<00:02:00.759> that<00:02:01.209> looks
