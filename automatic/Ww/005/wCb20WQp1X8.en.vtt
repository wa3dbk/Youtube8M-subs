00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:11.429
 Hi everyone, everything beauty. 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.500
 today we have the cave ball dominates nothing 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.969
 more is than an amino acid 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.800
 conditionally essential in nutrition 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.960
 any nutrient we call 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.330
 is essential means that our body 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.250
 It does not produce and we need to get 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.869
 from the diet food 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.090
 in the case of glutamine we call it 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.960
 conditionally because our body 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.449
 produces 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.000
 however in any case of stress 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.250
 with an infection with a large 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.540
 burn or even as an activity 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.430
 intense physics 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.710
 our body greatly increases the demand for 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.120
 this amino acid increase greatly increases the 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.040
 gotham mine consumption 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.110
 so always in these cases would be 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.180
 interesting to supplement this 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.129
 amino acid joÃ£o a lot friend 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.289
 perform various functions in our 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.090
 body I 'm going to speak here today with you 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.940
 basically two of them 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.550
 the first one is the immune function 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.770
 the improvement of the immune function I play 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.049
 particularly one of the best functions 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.510
 of fighting supplementation in our body 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.880
 the brute mine when it gets there in our 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.979
 intestine it functions as if it were a 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.170
 food for the session in the intestines 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.580
 which we call heterosis and it is well 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.860
 important people that we do not have 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.689
 this center bones very well jobs and 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.530
 well the jeans line because basically 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.030
 all that people like in charge of 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.670
 microorganisms in case of these bacteria 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.799
 these microorganisms do not honor in 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.509
 contact with our stomach ph that is 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.700
 extremely acidic 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.400
 most of them will reach practically 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.500
 intact in our gut then 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.079
 these cells are well aligned 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.600
 they guarantee that even a good part 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.979
 of these bacteria or protein pieces of 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.860
 large proteins that were not 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:51.030
 fully digested they guarantee this 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.189
 will not be absorbed and if part of 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.990
 bacteria or large proteins 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.509
 be absorbed they really can 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.149
 being awakening to various processes 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.409
 allergic diseases such as infections 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.520
 really are not interesting to 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.890
 our health 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.799
 in addition the vitamin can 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.200
 increase the amount of training 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.890
 lymphocytes in our body that are part of the 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.110
 of the session 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.959
 solange defense because the water also 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.990
 report closely related to the 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.670
 increase the rapid proliferation rooms 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.440
 as the saints is as is the case of our 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.850
 interests that are not present in the 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.819
 our intestinal barrier and how it is 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.230
 case of taxes was also the second 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.970
 glutamine function that we are going to 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.280
 approach to me today is also one of the 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.890
 important functions is the same and 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.240
 Protein Supplementation of Vitamin E 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.680
 important mainly obviously 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.989
 for those people who are 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.150
 more intense workout as we said 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.730
 at the beginning of vitamin A supplementation 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.080
 luck and one of these cases 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.620
 otherwise in the case of sedentary persons 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.330
 for example glutamine the fight itself 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.130
 my body produces it already goes 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.780
 be sufficient for the demand in these 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.670
 areas of other tissues 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.200
 but so the function of protecting oneself is well 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.930
 important because the UN is not 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.060
 nitrogen- donating 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.190
 will help the formation of several friends 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.470
 important to be 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.110
 incorporated into our muscle tissue and 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.540
 really help with the increase 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.100
 muscle tissue that obviously goes 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.040
 be stimulated from training 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.739
 of force for this the entrance of the concierge 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.900
 in the cell it already increases the uptake of 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.329
 sodium by this cell causes it to 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.970
 there is an increase in cellular volume 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:29.070
 the increase of this volume alone already generates 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.769
 an anabolic signal not to come from 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.269
 good personal protein synthesis this by 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.220
 Today I just hope you have 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.110
 Enjoy, keep following the people.
