two here file 2 of 2 here these are
compressed<00:00:31.650> files<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:33.890> we<00:00:34.890> need<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.190> extract

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
compressed files and we need to extract

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.660 
compressed files and we need to extract
the<00:00:36.030> files<00:00:36.239> which<00:00:36.899> are<00:00:37.050> inside<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.100> to

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
the first one I extracted it to a folder

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.030 
the first one I extracted it to a folder
I<00:01:18.630> just<00:01:19.409> named<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:20.119> you<00:01:21.119> know<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.600> 64<00:01:22.200> 1102

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
I just named it you know in 64 1102

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.560 
I just named it you know in 64 1102
database<00:01:24.470> but<00:01:25.470> when<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.070> are<00:01:26.220> extracting<00:01:27.090> the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
database but when you are extracting the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
database but when you are extracting the
second<00:01:27.930> one<00:01:28.250> the<00:01:29.250> important<00:01:29.790> thing<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.590> you

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
second one the important thing is you

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:45.080 
second one the important thing is you
need<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.119> extract<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:35.780> to<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.960> same<00:01:37.890> folder

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:58.380 

let's<00:01:45.659> see

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.790 

okay<00:01:59.140> I<00:01:59.320> just<00:02:00.810> did<00:02:01.810> a<00:02:01.840> cut<00:02:02.140> and<00:02:02.290> paste<00:02:02.350> and<00:02:02.680> copy

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
okay I just did a cut and paste and copy

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.310 
okay I just did a cut and paste and copy
and<00:02:03.040> paste<00:02:03.100> off<00:02:03.460> the<00:02:04.210> same<00:02:04.420> file<00:02:04.690> the<00:02:05.140> same

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
and paste off the same file the same

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:13.470 
and paste off the same file the same
folder<00:02:08.070> okay<00:02:10.230> so<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:11.770> basic<00:02:12.240> the<00:02:13.240> the

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
folder okay so the basic the the

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.020 
folder okay so the basic the the
important<00:02:13.930> thing<00:02:14.440> is<00:02:14.620> when<00:02:14.950> you<00:02:15.130> extract<00:02:15.730> the

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
important thing is when you extract the

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.450 
important thing is when you extract the
second<00:02:16.420> file<00:02:16.630> you<00:02:17.260> need<00:02:17.410> to<00:02:17.650> extract<00:02:18.010> that

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
second file you need to extract that

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.260 
second file you need to extract that
into<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.090> same<00:02:19.810> folder<00:02:20.290> where<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:21.310> first

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
into the same folder where the first

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.800 
into the same folder where the first
file<00:02:22.630> has<00:02:23.350> been<00:02:23.680> extracted<00:02:24.430> -<00:02:27.090> okay<00:02:28.090> it<00:02:28.540> says

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
file has been extracted - okay it says

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.900 
file has been extracted - okay it says
that<00:02:29.050> the<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.230> folder<00:02:29.950> is<00:02:30.100> already<00:02:30.400> there<00:02:30.580> do

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
that the the folder is already there do

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.340 
that the the folder is already there do
you<00:02:31.000> still<00:02:31.209> want<00:02:31.450> to<00:02:31.510> merge<00:02:31.720> this<00:02:31.930> folder<00:02:32.380> yes

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
you still want to merge this folder yes

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.030 
you still want to merge this folder yes
so<00:02:35.350> what<00:02:35.530> we<00:02:35.650> are<00:02:35.740> doing<00:02:35.770> is<00:02:36.130> we<00:02:36.310> are<00:02:36.340> putting

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
so what we are doing is we are putting

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.830 
so what we are doing is we are putting
both<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.370> installation<00:02:40.410> software<00:02:41.410> I<00:02:42.840> mean

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
both the installation software I mean

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.880 
both the installation software I mean
the<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:46.020> installation<00:02:47.020> software<00:02:47.200> that<00:02:49.890> we

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
the the installation software that we

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.760 
the the installation software that we
downloaded<00:02:51.070> from<00:02:51.550> Oracle<00:02:52.200> in<00:02:53.200> two<00:02:53.560> pieces

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
downloaded from Oracle in two pieces

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.750 
downloaded from Oracle in two pieces
which<00:02:54.340> is<00:02:54.550> one<00:02:54.940> of<00:02:55.090> two<00:02:55.330> and<00:02:55.660> two<00:02:56.080> of<00:02:56.230> two<00:02:56.760> we

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
which is one of two and two of two we

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.180 
which is one of two and two of two we
need<00:02:57.910> to<00:02:58.030> combine<00:02:58.239> them<00:02:58.570> and<00:02:58.780> put<00:02:59.350> them<00:02:59.470> in<00:02:59.650> one

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
need to combine them and put them in one

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.229 
need to combine them and put them in one
folder<00:03:00.720> before<00:03:01.720> installing<00:03:02.880> okay<00:03:03.880> so<00:03:03.970> that's

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
folder before installing okay so that's

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:14.119 
folder before installing okay so that's
what<00:03:04.420> I'm<00:03:04.900> doing<00:03:05.230> right<00:03:05.260> now

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:18.050 

otherwise<00:03:15.989> you<00:03:16.989> would<00:03:17.140> get<00:03:17.349> an<00:03:17.440> error<00:03:17.650> message

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
otherwise you would get an error message

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.699 
otherwise you would get an error message
of<00:03:19.060> a<00:03:19.510> file<00:03:20.019> missing<00:03:20.680> I<00:03:22.319> don't<00:03:23.319> remember<00:03:23.470> the

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
of a file missing I don't remember the

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:33.970 
of a file missing I don't remember the
files<00:03:23.920> name<00:03:25.980> so<00:03:26.980> but<00:03:27.129> this<00:03:27.280> is<00:03:27.340> very<00:03:27.640> important

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.570 

where<00:03:34.700> you<00:03:35.060> extract<00:03:35.870> file<00:03:36.379> one<00:03:36.680> into<00:03:37.040> a<00:03:37.069> folder

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
where you extract file one into a folder

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.089 
where you extract file one into a folder
and<00:03:37.730> then<00:03:38.330> you<00:03:38.540> extract<00:03:39.019> five<00:03:39.349> two<00:03:39.590> into<00:03:39.950> the

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:40.099 
and then you extract five two into the

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:43.269 
and then you extract five two into the
same<00:03:40.849> folder
