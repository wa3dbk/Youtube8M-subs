00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
Inferno camo that's always good Inferno

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.580 
Inferno camo that's always good Inferno
cam<00:00:51.539> was<00:00:51.660> awesome<00:00:52.079> especially<00:00:52.230> on<00:00:52.500> the

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
cam was awesome especially on the

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.979 
cam was awesome especially on the
Maverick<00:00:52.770> looks<00:00:53.070> pretty<00:00:53.250> nice<00:00:53.430> but<00:00:53.760> um<00:00:54.629> yeah

Maverick looks pretty nice but um yeah

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.720 
Maverick looks pretty nice but um yeah
so<00:00:55.170> basically<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:55.920> gamma<00:00:56.160> strike<00:00:56.309> every

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
so basically in this gamma strike every

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.939 
so basically in this gamma strike every
time<00:00:56.940> he<00:00:57.000> gets<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.510> kill<00:00:57.809> he<00:00:58.050> has<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.559> switch<00:00:58.800> his

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
time he gets a kill he has to switch his

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.619 
time he gets a kill he has to switch his
gun<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.309> get<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.579> another<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.270> next<00:01:00.480> kill

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
gun and get the another the next kill

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.900 
gun and get the another the next kill
with<00:01:00.809> his<00:01:00.960> other<00:01:01.170> gun<00:01:01.440> so<00:01:02.010> it's<00:01:02.190> not<00:01:02.250> extremely

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
with his other gun so it's not extremely

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.399 
with his other gun so it's not extremely
hard<00:01:03.210> but<00:01:03.359> it's<00:01:03.480> definitely<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.989> little<00:01:04.320> bit

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
hard but it's definitely a little bit

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.520 
hard but it's definitely a little bit
more<00:01:04.589> unique<00:01:04.920> different<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.470> personally<00:01:07.470> I

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
more unique different and personally I

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.870 
more unique different and personally I
think<00:01:07.619> it's<00:01:07.920> great<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.250> think<00:01:08.400> it's<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.729> really

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
think it's great I think it's a really

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.539 
think it's great I think it's a really
impressive<00:01:09.210> gameplay<00:01:10.100> because<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.250> have<00:01:11.400> to

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
impressive gameplay because you have to

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.880 
impressive gameplay because you have to
switch<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.909> have<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.840> can't<00:01:13.320> all<00:01:13.710> right

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
switch you have to you can't all right

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.230 
switch you have to you can't all right
so<00:01:13.979> let's<00:01:14.070> say<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.250> turn<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.850> corner<00:01:15.119> and
