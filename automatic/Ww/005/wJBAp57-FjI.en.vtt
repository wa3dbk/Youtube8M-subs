00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
one plot they could listen to all the

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.059 
one plot they could listen to all the
Codex<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.900> they<00:03:23.109> could

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:27.589 
Codex and they could
but<00:03:26.069> that<00:03:26.250> would<00:03:26.400> be<00:03:26.430> quite<00:03:26.879> boring<00:03:27.150> not

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
but that would be quite boring not

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.990
