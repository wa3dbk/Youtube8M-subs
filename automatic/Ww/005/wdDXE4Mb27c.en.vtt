00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
not counting news main stuff because

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.410 
not counting news main stuff because
it's<00:02:02.229> not<00:02:02.530> really<00:02:02.860> mine<00:02:03.040> yet<00:02:06.119> so<00:02:07.119> I<00:02:07.360> can't

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
it's not really mine yet so I can't

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.650 
it's not really mine yet so I can't
really<00:02:08.110> see<00:02:08.500> anything<00:02:08.800> else<00:02:09.340> by<00:02:10.090> bringing<00:02:10.479> my

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
really see anything else by bringing my

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.170 
really see anything else by bringing my
ship's<00:02:11.350> closer<00:02:11.650> to<00:02:11.860> shore<00:02:12.070> can't<00:02:12.760> quite<00:02:12.970> see

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
ship's closer to shore can't quite see

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.290 
ship's closer to shore can't quite see
to<00:02:13.390> their<00:02:13.540> city<00:02:17.430> but<00:02:18.430> we're<00:02:18.760> gonna<00:02:18.910> have<00:02:19.000> to

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
to their city but we're gonna have to

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.250 
to their city but we're gonna have to
disembark<00:02:19.690> anyway<00:02:20.140> and<00:02:21.720> take<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:22.870> risk<00:02:23.080> I

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
disembark anyway and take the risk I

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:38.180 
disembark anyway and take the risk I
guess

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.370 

and<00:02:39.190> that<00:02:39.970> city<00:02:40.270> is<00:02:40.390> making<00:02:40.840> a<00:02:40.900> lot<00:02:41.080> of<00:02:41.110> money

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
and that city is making a lot of money

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.710 
and that city is making a lot of money
off<00:02:41.470> of<00:02:41.710> that<00:02:41.740> part<00:02:42.040> so<00:02:42.850> it's<00:02:43.300> going<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:43.510> start

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
off of that part so it's going to start

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.960 
off of that part so it's going to start
bringing<00:02:44.530> up<00:02:44.770> the<00:02:44.950> regional<00:02:45.340> wealth<00:02:45.550> so

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
bringing up the regional wealth so

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.600 
bringing up the regional wealth so
that's<00:02:46.090> good<00:02:46.680> send<00:02:47.680> all<00:02:47.800> those<00:02:47.950> people<00:02:48.340> into

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
that's good send all those people into

00:02:48.610 --> 00:03:24.280 
that's good send all those people into
Florida

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.899 

and<00:03:25.290> we<00:03:25.860> also<00:03:25.980> don't<00:03:26.220> have<00:03:26.340> enough<00:03:26.640> money<00:03:26.790> to

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:26.909 
and we also don't have enough money to

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:29.119 
and we also don't have enough money to
repair<00:03:27.180> that<00:03:27.360> building<00:03:27.810> so<00:03:28.110> I'm<00:03:28.830> gonna<00:03:28.950> have

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
repair that building so I'm gonna have

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.190 
repair that building so I'm gonna have
to<00:03:29.250> wait<00:03:29.400> to<00:03:30.299> repair<00:03:30.750> both<00:03:30.900> of<00:03:31.080> those

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
to wait to repair both of those

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:43.640 
to wait to repair both of those
buildings<00:03:41.060> and<00:03:42.060> our<00:03:42.690> Navy<00:03:42.900> here<00:03:43.170> is<00:03:43.260> only<00:03:43.409> two

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
buildings and our Navy here is only two

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.809 
buildings and our Navy here is only two
sloops<00:03:43.950> so<00:03:44.540> I'm<00:03:45.540> going<00:03:45.840> to<00:03:45.870> increase<00:03:46.290> it<00:03:46.560> but<00:03:47.459> I

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
sloops so I'm going to increase it but I

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.920 
sloops so I'm going to increase it but I
think<00:03:48.209> I<00:03:48.599> just<00:03:49.400> get<00:03:50.400> another<00:03:50.579> sloop<00:03:51.000> I<00:03:51.239> don't

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
think I just get another sloop I don't

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.309 
think I just get another sloop I don't
know<00:03:51.989> why<00:03:52.170> I'm<00:03:52.760> Briggs<00:03:53.760> cost<00:03:54.390> more<00:03:54.690> but<00:03:55.079> then

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
know why I'm Briggs cost more but then

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.410 
know why I'm Briggs cost more but then
they<00:03:55.440> have<00:03:55.560> lower<00:03:55.739> stats<00:03:56.099> maybe<00:03:57.000> they<00:03:57.269> are

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
they have lower stats maybe they are

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.819 
they have lower stats maybe they are
better<00:03:57.660> but<00:03:57.959> I<00:03:58.200> don't<00:03:58.530> know<00:03:58.620> I<00:04:00.680> don't<00:04:01.680> usually

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
better but I don't know I don't usually

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:08.080 
better but I don't know I don't usually
use<00:04:02.250> them<00:04:02.519> well<00:04:02.790> actually<00:04:02.970> I<00:04:03.180> do<00:04:03.269> sometimes<00:04:03.569> I

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.430 

hope<00:04:09.090> the<00:04:09.239> French<00:04:09.420> don't<00:04:09.720> do<00:04:09.989> anything<00:04:10.200> in<00:04:10.409> the

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
hope the French don't do anything in the

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.099 
hope the French don't do anything in the
Americas<00:04:10.980> like<00:04:11.640> an<00:04:12.209> attack<00:04:12.510> me<00:04:12.720> because<00:04:12.840> I'm

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
Americas like an attack me because I'm

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:15.259 
Americas like an attack me because I'm
really<00:04:13.260> not<00:04:13.470> defended<00:04:14.159> the<00:04:14.730> only<00:04:14.940> army<00:04:15.239> I

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
really not defended the only army I

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.120 
really not defended the only army I
really<00:04:15.569> have<00:04:15.690> is<00:04:15.840> in<00:04:15.959> florida<00:04:16.229> and<00:04:16.560> i'd<00:04:17.010> have

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
really have is in florida and i'd have

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.400 
really have is in florida and i'd have
to<00:04:17.160> bring<00:04:17.400> it<00:04:17.489> up<00:04:17.579> and<00:04:17.760> fight<00:04:17.910> them<00:04:18.090> but<00:04:18.900> we're

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
to bring it up and fight them but we're

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.460 
to bring it up and fight them but we're
very<00:04:19.590> friendly<00:04:20.070> with<00:04:20.190> them<00:04:20.599> so<00:04:21.599> i<00:04:21.930> don't<00:04:22.320> think

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
very friendly with them so i don't think

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.050 
very friendly with them so i don't think
they're<00:04:22.620> gonna<00:04:22.680> do<00:04:22.889> anything<00:04:23.250> they're

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
they're gonna do anything they're

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.610 
they're gonna do anything they're
fighting<00:04:24.419> the<00:04:24.510> British<00:04:24.660> so<00:04:24.990> that's<00:04:25.349> probably

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
fighting the British so that's probably

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.440 
fighting the British so that's probably
why<00:04:25.830> they<00:04:26.010> came<00:04:26.130> down<00:04:26.370> so<00:04:26.580> far<00:04:26.789> well<00:04:27.180> that<00:04:27.300> is

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
why they came down so far well that is

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.800 
why they came down so far well that is
why<00:04:28.550> and<00:04:29.550> I<00:04:29.639> don't<00:04:29.669> think<00:04:29.940> they're<00:04:30.120> gonna<00:04:30.210> make

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
why and I don't think they're gonna make

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.050 
why and I don't think they're gonna make
any<00:04:31.020> more<00:04:31.200> moves<00:04:31.440> even<00:04:31.830> though<00:04:32.130> they<00:04:32.760> want

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
any more moves even though they want

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:50.510 
any more moves even though they want

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
big reinforcement army this was not what

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.700 
big reinforcement army this was not what
I<00:05:08.590> was<00:05:08.740> hoping<00:05:08.800> for<00:05:09.099> um<00:05:10.020> so<00:05:11.020> I'm<00:05:11.289> gonna<00:05:11.409> have<00:05:11.620> to

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
I was hoping for um so I'm gonna have to

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:17.189 
I was hoping for um so I'm gonna have to
retreat<00:05:12.099> maybe<00:05:12.490> we'll<00:05:12.639> have<00:05:12.819> to<00:05:14.550> like<00:05:15.550> I<00:05:16.199> don't

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:17.199 
retreat maybe we'll have to like I don't

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:19.589 
retreat maybe we'll have to like I don't
know<00:05:17.319> maybe<00:05:17.530> after<00:05:17.830> like<00:05:18.300> wait<00:05:19.300> a<00:05:19.330> while<00:05:19.569> until

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:19.599 
know maybe after like wait a while until

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:21.629 
know maybe after like wait a while until
the<00:05:20.139> reinforcements<00:05:20.860> come<00:05:21.009> or<00:05:21.190> something<00:05:21.460> cuz

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 
the reinforcements come or something cuz

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:23.939 
the reinforcements come or something cuz
it's<00:05:22.389> not<00:05:22.479> what<00:05:22.810> I<00:05:22.840> wanted<00:05:23.199> when<00:05:23.409> I<00:05:23.469> we<00:05:23.620> landed

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:23.949 
it's not what I wanted when I we landed

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:26.100 
it's not what I wanted when I we landed
here<00:05:24.129> it<00:05:24.400> might<00:05:24.610> have<00:05:24.729> been<00:05:24.819> a<00:05:24.879> mistake<00:05:25.110> the

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
here it might have been a mistake the

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.420 
here it might have been a mistake the
United<00:05:26.440> States<00:05:26.620> um<00:05:27.449> maybe<00:05:28.449> a<00:05:29.190> little<00:05:30.190> while

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
United States um maybe a little while

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.040 
United States um maybe a little while
i'll<00:05:30.610> look<00:05:30.789> into<00:05:30.969> getting<00:05:31.360> some<00:05:31.539> trade<00:05:31.870> with

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
i'll look into getting some trade with

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.459 
i'll look into getting some trade with
them<00:05:32.169> that<00:05:32.409> might<00:05:32.560> be<00:05:32.680> good<00:05:32.860> it<00:05:33.819> must<00:05:34.029> have

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:34.469 
them that might be good it must have

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:38.670 
them that might be good it must have
repelled<00:05:35.469> from<00:05:35.590> the<00:05:35.860> french<00:05:36.129> so<00:05:37.560> that's<00:05:38.560> the

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
repelled from the french so that's the

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.219 
repelled from the french so that's the
only<00:05:38.889> thing<00:05:39.009> could<00:05:39.310> have<00:05:39.400> happened<00:05:39.430> so<00:05:39.939> um<00:05:40.210> I

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:46.439 

don't<00:05:44.229> really<00:05:44.349> know<00:05:44.560> who<00:05:44.740> I<00:05:44.800> wins<00:05:45.449> like

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:46.449 
don't really know who I wins like

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:49.290 
don't really know who I wins like
probably<00:05:47.020> the<00:05:47.199> French<00:05:47.529> because<00:05:47.800> I<00:05:48.310> have

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
probably the French because I have

00:05:49.300 --> 00:06:02.270 
probably the French because I have
better<00:05:49.509> relations<00:05:50.080> with<00:05:50.169> them

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.680 

so<00:06:03.280> we're<00:06:03.460> going<00:06:03.520> to<00:06:03.640> send<00:06:03.880> part<00:06:04.150> of<00:06:04.240> our<00:06:04.360> army

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690 
so we're going to send part of our army

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:16.290 
so we're going to send part of our army
out<00:06:04.840> to<00:06:05.410> go<00:06:05.560> and<00:06:05.710> get<00:06:05.830> those<00:06:06.010> rebels<00:06:14.940> and<00:06:15.940> those

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
out to go and get those rebels and those

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:22.920 
out to go and get those rebels and those
esta<00:06:16.630> to<00:06:16.690> resolve<00:06:17.110> this<00:06:20.850> so<00:06:21.850> we<00:06:22.030> won<00:06:22.240> but<00:06:22.690> we're

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:22.930 
esta to resolve this so we won but we're

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.990 
esta to resolve this so we won but we're
out<00:06:22.960> of<00:06:23.050> movement<00:06:23.500> points<00:06:23.650> and<00:06:24.070> not<00:06:24.730> just<00:06:24.880> go

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 
out of movement points and not just go

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.060 
out of movement points and not just go
ahead<00:06:25.120> and<00:06:25.210> heal<00:06:25.480> everyone<00:06:25.750> up<00:06:25.990> and<00:06:26.230> tell

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.070 
ahead and heal everyone up and tell

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:49.340 
ahead and heal everyone up and tell
where<00:06:27.280> to<00:06:27.370> go<00:06:27.490> for<00:06:27.610> next<00:06:27.850> turn

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:49.350 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:53.160 

so<00:06:50.350> I'm<00:06:51.250> sort<00:06:51.430> of<00:06:51.610> scout<00:06:51.910> out<00:06:52.090> with<00:06:52.270> army

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:53.170 
so I'm sort of scout out with army

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:54.270 
so I'm sort of scout out with army
because<00:06:53.290> I<00:06:53.410> don't<00:06:53.530> want<00:06:53.590> to<00:06:53.740> get<00:06:53.830> intercepted

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:54.280 
because I don't want to get intercepted

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.580 
because I don't want to get intercepted
and<00:06:54.700> good<00:06:55.390> news<00:06:55.570> there's<00:06:55.810> nothing<00:06:56.170> on<00:06:56.350> the<00:06:56.470> way

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:56.590 
and good news there's nothing on the way

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.220 
and good news there's nothing on the way
there<00:06:57.180> that<00:06:58.180> one<00:06:58.360> army<00:06:58.720> might<00:06:58.900> be<00:06:58.990> able<00:06:59.080> to

00:06:59.220 --> 00:06:59.230 
there that one army might be able to

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:00.870 
there that one army might be able to
reinforce<00:06:59.500> and<00:06:59.950> help<00:07:00.340> them<00:07:00.490> defend<00:07:00.760> their
