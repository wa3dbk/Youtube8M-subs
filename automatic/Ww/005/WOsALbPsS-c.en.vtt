00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:17.880
 Greetings colleagues I'm r4 rap team 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.710
 medicine and in this space of myths and 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.200
 popular beliefs of medicine 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.770
 guidance we bring you the following 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.770
 question mark 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.810
 and it will be true that both the hair and the 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.230
 nails continue to grow after the 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.230
 death 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:46.239
 and those who answered true are 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.239
 in the wrong 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:55.360
 now I will explain why 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.920
 which idea is completely wrong 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.770
 if we realize during all the 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.630
 vital process of each individual all 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.960
 the cells of the organism are being 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:08.090
 irrigated constantly remember this 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.550
 irrigation is given by pumping the 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.760
 heart by the circulation of blood 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.580
 through the blood vessels 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:20.000
 then some irrigation that is the one 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:23.150
 allows oxygenation and nutrition 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.910
 the same from these cells in some 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.520
 particular moment stops or be 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:31.610
 blocks as it happens at the time of 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.350
 death because there will not be oxygenation 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.140
 there's going to be nutrition there's going to be 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.820
 cell division and in this process 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.820
 then the tissue dies 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.680
 so what does it look like? 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.530
 or what it is that gives the 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.050
 people that both hair and nails 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.890
 they continue to grow after death 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:10.140
 because already here the skin undergoes a process of 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.630
 dehydration in which this 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.150
 progressive dehydration leads to a 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.120
 Shrinkage is to say the skin shrinks 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.980
 and both the nails and the perÃº that form 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.590
 a fabric that was used hard not 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.260
 they suffer this process of dehydration 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:28.230
 whereby the hair and nails are 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.600
 they keep their size to give you to understand that 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.760
 they have grown but they have not grown as 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.410
 he had explained to them they have remained with 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.130
 its appearance 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.130
 that they had previously
