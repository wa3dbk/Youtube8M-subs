00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.890
 good 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.059
 hello that such a freaking mosquito 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.849
 let's make a trap to catch 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.710
 mosquitoes and is based on a design that 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:23.230
 I've seen with the networks and cells of a 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.930
 time and its power lies in that generates 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.840
 co2 carbon dioxide that is attractive 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.540
 for the dots in our body 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.480
 generates a weak upward current of 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.730
 air warmer than air then 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.160
 surrounds and mosquitoes are able to 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.730
 detect these very weak current of 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.309
 air and then start a movement 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.289
 descending in our search and they come up with 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.079
 us but it also seems to be 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:52.079
 who are also able to detect what 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.489
 part of that little stream 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.679
 converted to that amount what part of 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.780
 that current has more CO2 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:01.690
 that's why the bites on the wrists and 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.789
 in the ankles are more frequent well 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.280
 well let's take advantage of this belief 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.250
 that mosquitoes have by the co2 for 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.680
 hunt them down 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.200
 before continuing I want to reassure 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.240
 someone an issue for this gas for the co2 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.979
 that this has been to me in many less 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.720
 the proportions in which it will be generated 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.850
 in our trap in fact a person 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.180
 that sleeps with us in the room 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:26.790
 will generate much more CO2 than the 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.160
 trap we are going to do the assembly 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.170
 let's do the trap we need a 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.260
 mineral water bottle this is a liter 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.870
 and a half and we're going to cut it more or less 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.300
 around here you have to keep in mind that there 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.610
 to leave not only space for 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.110
 water with the attractant but a camera 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.170
 air so they can enter the 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.400
 mosquitoes and also space for in the 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.070
 top of the bottle that the 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.510
 we will put it as a funnel more or less 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.080
 here we can cut it with a 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:59.040
 knife or with scissors with a cutter like 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.110
 more we like let's cut already 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.320
 cut the bottle let's take advantage of 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.910
 lower part as it happened and this part 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.970
 top we will introduce it by 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.740
 inverted above a funnel and 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.490
 doing a bit of pressure you have to 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.490
 leave it fixed 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.690
 we leave more or less flush both pieces 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:27.330
 of the bottle and we have to ensure that 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.950
 there are no spaces around for 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.550
 that mosquitoes can not escape 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.400
 mosquitoes to enter the center 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.040
 if necessary with the floor or glue 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.219
 so there's no 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.560
 openings on the sides this is already 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:42.989
 mounted 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.750
 the next step is to cover the trap 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.489
 with black paper or if not a plastic 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.239
 black like this I've cut it in a 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:54.450
 garbage bag and the idea is so 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.150
 cover the entire trap so that it does not 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.390
 between the light 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.519
 and now we would look with floor with 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.730
 elastic tape with rubber bands with 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.470
 glue as best we think it should 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.840
 be a so 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.280
 but this I'm going to put it after 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.430
 I prefer that the trap stay in the air 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.290
 so you can see when I put in the 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.450
 We are going to do it now 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.760
 same 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.680
 It is time to put into 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.190
 the trap the product that will generate 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.050
 the co2 those that you have seen my 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.629
 video of how to create ethyl alcohol to 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.970
 from the orange juice you will see that it 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:33.370
 I used that juice and yeast 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.340
 bakery fresh yeast to create 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.810
 alcohol detachment well co2 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.050
 here we are going to do the same thing instead of 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.030
 with orange juice with brown sugar and 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.440
 with yeast also but unlike 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.140
 of 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.510
 from that experiment we 're not going to create 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.880
 alcohol since this is not closed 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.800
 the medically corner is on the air 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.960
 let's generate instead of alcohol 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.640
 acetic acid vinegar but well that we 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.670
 it does not matter to us what interests us 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.880
 is the CO2 that is going to be produced 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.320
 exactly the same let's proceed in 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.470
 200 cubic centimeters of water more or 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:11.800
 less lukewarm at about 30 degrees no more than 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.980
 40 because if we could not turn off 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:18.180
 kill the yeast let's dissolve 50 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.180
 grams of brown sugar 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.780
 no no no 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.320
 well all the dissolved sugar is already 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.599
 we put it inside the trap 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.349
 and now the yeast is not going to 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.110
 dissolve we put it like this as is 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:52.139
 to last longer it ensures 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:55.009
 Fermentation time of at least 10 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:58.949
 days issuing co2 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:05:01.560
 now it would only be necessary to cover this 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:03.210
 with the paper or the black plastic step 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.880
 that I omitted before so this will serve 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.040
 clearer and put the trap in one place 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.140
 suitable 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.150
 let's put the trap in the room 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.980
 that we want to protect in a location 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.890
 quiet and without drafts 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.120
 because if it would not lose effectiveness this 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.280
 trap is not going to start working 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.930
 immediately once assembled 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.810
 you have to wait between three and six hours 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.210
 so that it starts generating co2 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.650
 depending on the room temperature 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.140
 we can know this by putting the ear 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:34.820
 near the opening and we'll say it a 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.820
 bubbling if it's already working
