00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.800
 Hello 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.330
 today we will talk about how 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.100
 determine what and how many places 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.850
 on your hard drive 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.710
 take off the files of the folder 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.200
 who most forgets places 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.340
 to free on free 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.740
 we have spaces 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.360
 we use 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.630
 such a disc so in time we have 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.080
 accumulates a lot of folder rules 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:43.460
 folders today we know about this we 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:47.960
 change we hammer what where are recorded 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:50.250
 when together we have very few people too 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:55.050
 become necessary 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:57.080
 Formations about it takes waiting for an 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.080
 answer 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.970
 today we talk about one program 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.000
 which simplify our action 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.710
 save us the path boiled this 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.940
 the program is called 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:17.200
 open a pine to the bride 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.200
 part-time process 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.620
 at the beginning of the installation of the adopted 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.620
 match 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:34.560
 tell her you can bypass us minus 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.560
 20 liters like him 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:42.310
 vkontakte server 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.229
 true to my faith she 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.080
 I have a program for Sidorov 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.380
 brazier view therefore 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.060
 stop to 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.060
 hidden after you caress her 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.960
 so opened on this program 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:03.690
 see the program requests us 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:07.229
 his actions we can choose which 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.530
 the disk we will scan can choose 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:15.840
 several disks 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:16.650
 which it is possible 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.670
 scan 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:25.650
 one kind of folder if we have up to 3 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.600
 masonry from the dark attempts choose 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:34.380
 I like to scan, for example 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:35.640
 10 system vibral push so we 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.750
 gone scan 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:48.570
 the program scans all folders and files 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:48.930
 to anticipate the size on after 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.440
 as 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:56.180
 scans order all files by 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:03:01.519
 killing the largest size 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.519
 small you just have to choose 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:10.310
 exactly you do not need and delete will create 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.310
 Johns and end of scan 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:18.829
 the program just kind of think figure it out 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.550
 so I already had a scan 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:36.280
 so I have it very quickly passes 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:36.280
 and so the scan is complete 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:46.210
 the left side we see that I am more 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:49.240
 just takes a folder windows 3 16 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.240
 and gigabytes 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.930
 except for free space 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.630
 so here we can open folders 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.280
 look under the folder to build how much 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.280
 takes place 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:28.580
 26 desktop 21 megabytes is the desktop 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.480
 look answer 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:45.300
 specially throw a desktop 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:48.030
 to show how to delete here is 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:52.970
 button to remove without the possibility 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.970
 restore where to hit the basket at 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.240
 me 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.960
 just open the monuments and windows and 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.960
