00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.400
 Hello, Sir, Modest Tastes from the kitchen 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.360
 we will share a recipe from you in this section 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.360
 We will learn about the production of "Potato Sufle" 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.360
 But if you want to have a look at the necessary materials before 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.560
 4 pieces of medium potato 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.040
 2 tablespoons of butter 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.680
 2 tea cups of milk 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.400
 3 eggs 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.280
 1 packet of baking powder 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.520
 1 tablespoon flour 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.800
 1 teaspoon of fine grated fresh cheddar cheese 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.800
 and salt 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.400
 we've learned the necessary ingredients for the souffle 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.840
 Let's start with our potatoes now 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.520
 we cut our potatoes in a big way 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.320
 today we'll rob your shells, we will consume 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.400
 Now let's go to the stove to fry 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.040
 we put our pan in the fire 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.440
 we put enough hot water so that the nutritional value does not rise into the water 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.520
 so we added water to face 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.840
 we closed the lid, we cooked until it is completely soft 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.760
 potatoes 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.280
 but we'll show you how the souffle containers are lubricated before you start 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.680
 The most important issue in making souffle is to lubricate these containers 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.520
 oven temperature resistant and use flat bowls 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:16.760
 we're feeding oil so we can hand all over our hands 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.680
 leaving some flour on 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.240
 in this way we ensure that the flour adheres to each side 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.160
 more oil after pouring into other containers 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.120
 after lubricating our containers ... 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.880
 the potatoes we boiled together with the juice ... 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.600
 you already know that we used a small amount of water 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.480
 mash 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:05.600
 crush any tattoos until they are completely free 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.760
 in the meantime we will not neglect butter 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.480
 we will add butter 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.840
 and continue 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.760
 we continue to crush by adding our milk 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.960
 we have added the remaining milk 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.800
 The final ingredients of our mash kashar cheese and salt 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.720
 some salt ... 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.040
 and 1 cup of fresh cheddar cheese 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.880
 and passing to the final touches 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.400
 we added our butter, we had a nice mash 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.120
 we are now moving to our other container 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.960
 we are breaking 3 eggs in our other container 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.640
 too little salt for easy disintegration 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.640
 and flutter 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.040
 on our milk ... 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.600
 View our ... 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.640
 may be 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.720
 flour is not used in some sources, do not be surprised 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.840
 and add a pack of baking powder 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.480
 and mix it for a while until it's integrated 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.840
 Add the porridge we prepared with spoon 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 We have to feed ... 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 adding the second 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.360
 in this way until the purÃ©e is completely finished 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.840
 the two mixes in a uniform manner 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.520
 we leave our mixture to the containers we have previously lubricated 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.560
 we have prepared the last souvenir 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.600
 let's leave it to the tray 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.600
 if you pay attention not too much 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.680
 let's pour 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:48.400
 Now we can give it to the oven at 170 degrees 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.400
 35 minutes later 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.760
 potato baked in oven, baked in 170 degrees oven for 35 minutes 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.760
 blushed 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.840
 Let's consume immediately without further cooling and extinguishing 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.800
 Modest Flavors in this part of the kitchen ... 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.120
 we shared a beautiful recipe 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.440
 We learned the construction of the "Potato Sufle". 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.880
 I would like you to try and remember us as soon as possible, sir 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.080
 goodbye...
