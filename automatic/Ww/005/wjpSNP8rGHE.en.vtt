00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
and you know it's not only the flight

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.939 
and you know it's not only the flight
but<00:00:59.030> you<00:00:59.149> got<00:00:59.329> to<00:00:59.359> think<00:00:59.569> about<00:00:59.719> hotel<00:01:00.350> food

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
but you got to think about hotel food

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.350 
but you got to think about hotel food
you<00:01:01.909> know<00:01:02.059> it<00:01:02.449> adds<00:01:02.989> up<00:01:03.289> it's<00:01:04.159> expensive<00:01:05.059> at

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
the end of the day so that's why you

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.330
