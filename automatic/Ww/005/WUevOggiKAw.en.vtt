00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.370
 good we want to be we have to give them in that we are going to win and you have 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.090
 to win this month that I will continue to fight for 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:08.419
 to obtain it 

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:13.230
 with these goes into the 'top ten' all that all beds to be cheered by 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.859
 of points but we are that Christian assimilated very little time the 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.230
 values ​​of Real Madrid is something that seems clear this sentence that just 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.189
 listening could be perfectly 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.249
 the summary of the madridista thought to never give up like this is Christian 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:31.570
 good the prisoners without sentence although the recoil of 3 6% and came to be 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.470
 A) Yes 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.800
 and faithful to his spirit was the match of ronaldo before osasuna christian is a 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.000
 tireless fighter a nonconformist who always gets upset if the play does not end 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.530
 in goal 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.379
 a winner unaffordable to pessimism a tremendous footballer who will be better or 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.680
 worse but he always pulls the car like in the equalizer goal seen like this 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.460
 is a great goal has everything power speed dribbling and definition 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.680
 but seen from the beginning of the play also has faith 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.930
 30 meters ahead 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.040
 five players surrounding him 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.440
 and then we go what is said cristian in was the goal of the draw at one goal 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.030
 of victory so for Portuguese there is not much time that 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.650
 to lose 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.299
 celebration pulling to cut 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.299
 the band cooled down a bit and again to the top concentrated error of the rival in 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.070
 the serve 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.770
 and ronaldo recovered 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.870
 but osasuna turned forward something that according to Christian the Real Madrid does not 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.960
 should allow that to happen that's 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.920
 but as they have done a few times 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.110
 I showed at home we have to win 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.030
 if not always home doing for good we play more hobby a thousand fear is more 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.480
 strong when we play at home we can not allow a team to mark two balloons 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.100
 and kerosene you take out first with us, plus you have to improve your 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.270
 situation for users pacheco a good answer if it is possible to dial 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.560
 three goals 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.790
 as good 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.660
 Fortunately, Marcelo became for a moment the best headliner 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.420
 possible with a tie 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.200
 it came to rest 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.409
 the second part was the perfect script of the best suspense movie of 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.550
 those in which we do not know the end until the last literal minute in this 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.039
 case 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.069
 it's true or maybe deep areas very well 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.999
 on red background coupled 

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:18.829
 taro understand we depend on ten dam a 100 that non 30 nadal tires for that 

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:21.809
 we managed to reach 2 to 0 

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:23.929
 i are all of 

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:27.279
 with the big screen the prize the constancy for cristian and for the 

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:31.119
 madrid was third the Portuguese tremendous assistentialism by the way is 

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:32.260
 breakable affine 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.480
 is the one that makes the best pass at the second post hold up in the air and 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.229
 stay stuck until the ball arrives 

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:42.579
 now it is the victory and now that Christian celebrates as if 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.409
 worth a league lucas lobos 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:46.879
 but you have to continue as a tireless Christian
