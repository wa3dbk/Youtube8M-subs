the comment section below what you think

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.889 
the comment section below what you think
of<00:02:01.950> this<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.430> think<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:03.360> it's<00:02:03.509> going<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.780> be<00:02:03.869> a

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
of this I think that it's going to be a

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.649 
of this I think that it's going to be a
huge<00:02:04.229> upset<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:05.009> think<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:05.969> this<00:02:06.329> is<00:02:06.390> just

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
huge upset I think that this is just

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.479 
huge upset I think that this is just
proving<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.740> call<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.340> to

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
proving that the call of you to

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.630 
proving that the call of you to
community<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:09.239> definitely<00:02:10.200> kind<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.920> really

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
community is definitely kind of a really

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.670 
community is definitely kind of a really
really<00:02:11.819> bad<00:02:12.150> community<00:02:12.840> in<00:02:12.959> some<00:02:13.170> sense<00:02:13.440> be

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
really bad community in some sense be

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.429 
really bad community in some sense be
cause<00:02:13.829> we're<00:02:14.370> all<00:02:14.549> kind<00:02:14.849> of<00:02:15.230> focused<00:02:16.230> on

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
cause we're all kind of focused on

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:18.530 
cause we're all kind of focused on
criticizing<00:02:17.310> one<00:02:17.760> another<00:02:18.030> instead<00:02:18.209> of

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
criticizing one another instead of

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.679 
criticizing one another instead of
helping<00:02:18.780> one<00:02:19.140> another<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.859> I<00:02:20.129> think<00:02:20.430> that<00:02:20.730> it

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:21.689 
helping one another and I think that it

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:23.929 
helping one another and I think that it
is<00:02:21.719> kind<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.409> definitely<00:02:23.219> showing<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:23.700> toll

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:23.939 
is kind of definitely showing the toll

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:27.199 
is kind of definitely showing the toll
on<00:02:24.209> a<00:02:24.569> lot<00:02:24.959> of<00:02:25.170> youtubers<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.069> no<00:02:26.790> it<00:02:26.939> seems

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
on a lot of youtubers and no it seems

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.780 
on a lot of youtubers and no it seems
like<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.780> lot<00:02:28.049> of<00:02:28.290> competitive<00:02:29.189> players<00:02:29.519> as

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
like a lot of competitive players as

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.530 
like a lot of competitive players as
well<00:02:29.870> so<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:31.200> looks<00:02:31.620> like<00:02:31.709> this<00:02:32.639> is<00:02:32.879> definitely

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
well so it looks like this is definitely

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.300 
well so it looks like this is definitely
going<00:02:33.659> to<00:02:33.750> impact<00:02:34.049> the<00:02:34.439> competitive<00:02:35.069> scene

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
going to impact the competitive scene

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.780 
going to impact the competitive scene
somehow<00:02:35.879> as<00:02:36.719> we<00:02:36.959> not<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.859> competitive<00:02:38.549> call

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
somehow as we not the competitive call

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.209 
somehow as we not the competitive call
of<00:02:38.939> duty<00:02:39.239> will<00:02:39.359> be<00:02:39.480> playing<00:02:39.780> its<00:02:39.959> x<00:02:40.200> games<00:02:40.620> this
