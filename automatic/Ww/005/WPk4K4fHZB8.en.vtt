00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
and kind of just pull it that way and I

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:43.440 
and kind of just pull it that way and I
rotate<00:01:32.009> in<00:01:32.429> the<00:01:32.640> same<00:01:32.850> time<00:01:33.229> in<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.350> next

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450
