00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
for another example this is a vapor

for another example this is a vapor
shirt<00:01:22.549> this<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.759> pastel<00:01:24.299> color<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.900> so

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
shirt this is a pastel color and so

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.740 
shirt this is a pastel color and so
we're<00:01:25.560> still<00:01:25.799> able<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.070> get<00:01:26.220> most<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.970> our<00:01:27.330> full

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
range of colors on here so we can do a

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.730

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
do this is an early sample we made a

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.110 
do this is an early sample we made a
while<00:02:10.399> ago<00:02:10.700> and<00:02:10.940> this<00:02:11.330> is<00:02:12.130> our<00:02:13.130> logo<00:02:13.430> in<00:02:13.730> black

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
on a dark red shirt you probably can't

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.690 
on a dark red shirt you probably can't
even<00:02:17.360> see<00:02:17.510> it<00:02:17.840> on<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.050> video<00:02:18.290> but<00:02:18.620> because<00:02:19.370> the

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
even see it on the video but because the

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.820 
even see it on the video but because the
tonal<00:02:20.090> range<00:02:20.150> of<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.540> red<00:02:20.780> is<00:02:21.080> so<00:02:21.500> close<00:02:21.800> to

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
tonal range of the red is so close to

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.850 
tonal range of the red is so close to
the<00:02:22.100> black<00:02:22.310> you<00:02:22.610> can't<00:02:22.910> see<00:02:23.030> anything<00:02:23.480> so<00:02:23.860> this

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
the black you can't see anything so this

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.010 
the black you can't see anything so this
just<00:02:25.370> want<00:02:25.640> to<00:02:25.700> reinforce<00:02:25.910> bright<00:02:26.720> color

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
just to show you the difference between

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.370 
just to show you the difference between
this<00:02:34.070> is<00:02:34.310> a<00:02:34.580> full-color<00:02:35.030> image<00:02:35.420> on<00:02:35.630> a<00:02:36.110> white

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
this is a full-color image on a white

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.120 
this is a full-color image on a white
shirt<00:02:36.710> and<00:02:37.690> we<00:02:38.690> printed<00:02:39.050> the<00:02:39.170> same<00:02:39.500> image<00:02:39.860> on

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
shirt and we printed the same image on

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.090 
shirt and we printed the same image on
an<00:02:40.430> orange<00:02:40.850> shirt<00:02:41.180> just<00:02:42.080> so<00:02:42.200> you<00:02:42.290> can<00:02:42.440> see<00:02:42.680> the

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
an orange shirt just so you can see the

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.460 
an orange shirt just so you can see the
comparison<00:02:43.760> between<00:02:43.880> them<00:02:44.270> so<00:02:44.959> if<00:02:45.080> we<00:02:45.200> do<00:02:45.320> that

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
comparison between them so if we do that

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.290 
comparison between them so if we do that
same<00:02:45.740> image<00:02:45.950> on<00:02:46.220> orange<00:02:46.580> it<00:02:46.700> kind<00:02:46.880> of<00:02:46.910> drops

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
same image on orange it kind of drops

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.470 
same image on orange it kind of drops
out<00:02:47.600> all<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.560> orange<00:02:48.920> you<00:02:49.040> can't<00:02:49.310> see<00:02:49.670> because

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
out all the orange you can't see because

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.360 
out all the orange you can't see because
it<00:02:50.840> blends<00:02:51.140> right<00:02:51.440> into<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.709> orange<00:02:52.070> shirt

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
it blends right into the orange shirt

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.310 
it blends right into the orange shirt
and<00:02:52.610> because<00:02:53.240> there's<00:02:53.420> no<00:02:53.540> white<00:02:53.750> background

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
and because there's no white background

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.530 
and because there's no white background
it<00:02:54.560> becomes<00:02:54.980> kind<00:02:55.220> of<00:02:55.280> a<00:02:55.370> muted<00:02:55.730> softer<00:02:56.240> print

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
it becomes kind of a muted softer print

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.320 
it becomes kind of a muted softer print
so<00:02:57.350> can<00:02:57.709> we<00:02:57.860> print<00:02:58.100> dice<00:02:58.340> up<00:02:58.610> on<00:02:58.820> different

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
so can we print dice up on different

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.930 
so can we print dice up on different
color<00:02:59.510> garments<00:02:59.989> absolutely<00:03:00.830> we<00:03:01.610> just<00:03:01.790> need
