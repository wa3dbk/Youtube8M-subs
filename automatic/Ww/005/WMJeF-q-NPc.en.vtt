00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920
 I descend from the somali pirates 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.570
 the 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.850
 hey what are you doing here and here 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.940
 that those rubber boats are sailing 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:36.120
 how you go somewhere or not 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:37.770
 yes you also know where i think i am 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.430
 just the other yellow boats and blue 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.430
 message full 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.150
 norm spirit of and partying he goes that 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.500
 you can say 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.989
 honk now very cheerful 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.880
 all we actually come here to do 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.309
 I was asked to act as an ambassador 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.780
 to give the starting shot is charging 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.490
 element the most important thing in this 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.110
 party 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:00.030
 i would know u is the first time for me 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.180
 I think the most important thing is that 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.940
 everyone goes on the trip and especially 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:11.190
 these are not such events 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:12.840
 there important light from belgium which 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.640
 light is sickness 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.200
 I think it is much more important 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.979
 then play a game of war in it 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.810
 Middle East 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.140
 for example as something diplomatically something 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.140
 to say 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.270
 tents 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:49.450
 no actually coming it started 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.830
 actually in Amsterdam and there were some 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.900
 colleagues of mine who by now unfortunately 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.820
 not the initiators 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.740
 actually for me even a person who 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.940
 I did that for five years 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.650
 long time but who had given up 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.870
 also no longer fancy because organized 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.490
 it became too big and then we have 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.800
 actually take over the baton 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.110
 taken and it happens unsolicited and 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.300
 you will first try this 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.500
 no this is the second time last year 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.960
 it's done but they do it 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.610
 smaller scale than this year and last 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.960
 years I only had 40 participants and them 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.420
 was able to see 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.940
 today there were 400 so that is one 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.460
 an increase of nearly 1,000 patients 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.570
 really a lot of people a lot of you had your 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.830
 never expected so many people 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.270
 would be 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.620
 no I did expect sludge a lot 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.330
 people would come but this is real 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.610
 unbelievable 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.320
 and why rubber boats actually at 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.820
 first back boat are great fun and 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.530
 Means of transport that people find themselves 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.810
 have to be transported more often in one 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.610
 inflatable boat dutch country of the 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.360
 but that would also be the country of the 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.440
 inflatable boats 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.360
 We can finally be whole 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.580

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.959

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.170

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.270

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.860
 outwards also well we have one 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.800
