00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.110
 hello everyone I'm dani and I'm here 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.270
 new in minecraft to bring you a new 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.250
 reston tutorial in this video I'm going 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.279
 to teach how to zoom in to 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.410
 your adventure maps here we have 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.910
 a kind of viewpoint when approaching 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.770
 the window of how you see activates the 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.989
 zoom effect as if we were looking 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.759
 through binoculars also not 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.649
 I can move or jump while I'm 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.450
 in this position to return to the 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.390
 normality I just have to press 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.399
 in this button here and ready 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.079
 all this can be done thanks to 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.579
 command effect the zoom and the 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.309
 immobilization are achieved with the 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.809
 effect of slowness at level 6 as you see 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.940
 the camera approaches and we can not 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.890
 move though we can keep jumping 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.600
 to prevent this last we will have to 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.350
 apply the increased jump effect 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.030
 at level 128 or higher once 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.070
 we know this mechanism is very easy 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.600
 to understand when the plate is activated 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.190
 pressure sequentially they go 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.229
 activating this row of blocks of 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.970
 commands each one has the command 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.390
 effects that will be applied slowly from 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.580
 level 0 to level 6 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.870
 we could perfectly fit a single 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.240
 command block that directly 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.770
 you apply at level 6 as you see 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.780
 working but doing it from this 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.700
 way we get a more zoom effect 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.880
 soft that I personally like 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.880
 plus 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.920
 this command block applies the 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:32.630
 jump effect increased to level 128 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.250
 so you can not jump and on the other 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.630
 side we have these blocks here that 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.939
 what they do is disable the two 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.409
 effects when the button is activated both 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.079
 to the slowness as the jump 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.549
 increased, also comment that what 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.560
 who make these torches here is 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.479
 deactivate the effects in case the 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.429
 Player gets out of the pressure plate 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.020
 it is not obligatory to put them so that 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:52.759
 operate the mechanism but in this case 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.500
 I'm interested in the player staying 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.470
 on the pressure plate so you can 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.179
 look through the window correctly 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.310
 Finally, comment that if you are going to use 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:03.110
 this system in a multiplayer map os 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.759
 I advise you to put the coordinates of the 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.619
 point where you want the player to be 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.060
 since if there are several people being 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.709
 the command blocks pretty 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.280
 separated the system might not work 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.720
 correctly and good to comment too 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.519
 that with this system you can do 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.440
 many more things for example in 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.730
 place of buttons to cancel the effect 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.290
 you could do that on a map of 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.569
 adventures when the player looks at 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.160
 a window will activate the zoom effect and 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.810
 appear in the chat something about the 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.500
 map history or anything else 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.500
 what do you want 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.040
 and that has been all I hope that I have 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.930
 liked not many people still know that 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.760
 you can get zoom effects and 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.230
 mobilization and prevent the jump and 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.600
 Thanks to this, things can be done 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.790
 really interesting if you have any 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.040
 doubt you will have the map to download in 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.660
 the description of the video and nothing else a 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.660
 greeting and until the next video
