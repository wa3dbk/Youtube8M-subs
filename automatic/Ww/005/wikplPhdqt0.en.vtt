just<00:00:57.960> tricks<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:58.949> into<00:00:59.010> thinking<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.460> is

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
just tricks you into thinking that is

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.209

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
thick definitely at the tip it's a

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.950 
thick definitely at the tip it's a
little<00:01:02.430> bit<00:01:02.550> thicker<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.239> at<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.570> same<00:01:03.719> time<00:01:03.930> i

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
little bit thicker so at the same time i

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:04.939 
little bit thicker so at the same time i
don't<00:01:04.080> know<00:01:04.290> if<00:01:04.379> it's<00:01:04.470> something<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:04.830> you

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
don't know if it's something that you

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.990 
don't know if it's something that you
would<00:01:05.100> necessarily<00:01:05.510> be<00:01:06.510> prying<00:01:07.320> with<00:01:07.680> as<00:01:08.610> you

would<00:01:09.150> normally<00:01:09.900> be<00:01:10.140> thinking<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.740> you

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
would normally be thinking that you

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.920 
would normally be thinking that you
would<00:01:11.010> do<00:01:11.189> with<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:12.240> strider<00:01:12.630> knife<00:01:12.900> but<00:01:13.250> oh

it against the small Sebenza and Stingo
you<00:01:26.220> know<00:01:26.340> it's<00:01:26.720> for<00:01:27.720> knives<00:01:27.960> these<00:01:28.290> size<00:01:28.590> it's

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
actually quite a bit smaller

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.370 
actually quite a bit smaller
you<00:01:32.729> got<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.060> large<00:01:33.270> depends<00:01:33.689> right<00:01:33.869> here<00:01:34.170> and

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
you got the large depends right here and

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.940 
you got the large depends right here and
then<00:01:35.030> here's<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.119> techno<00:01:36.689> from<00:01:37.320> spider<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.799> go

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
then here's the techno from spider it go

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.969 
then here's the techno from spider it go
so<00:01:38.909> this<00:01:39.090> is<00:01:39.270> one<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.479> my<00:01:39.689> favorite<00:01:40.200> like<00:01:40.470> small

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
so this is one of my favorite like small

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.910 
so this is one of my favorite like small
knives<00:01:41.250> in<00:01:41.579> my<00:01:42.150> collection<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:43.470> then<00:01:43.740> here

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
knives in my collection and then here

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.649 
knives in my collection and then here
you<00:01:43.950> have<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.340> against<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.909> strider<00:01:46.280> SNG<00:01:47.659> so

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
you have it against a strider SNG so

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.170 
you have it against a strider SNG so
obviously<00:01:49.439> substantially<00:01:50.189> bigger<00:01:50.399> so<00:01:50.729> when

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
obviously substantially bigger so when

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.139 
obviously substantially bigger so when
you're<00:01:51.299> talking<00:01:51.570> about<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.930> lineup<00:01:52.369> you<00:01:53.369> know

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
you're talking about the lineup you know

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.270 
you're talking about the lineup you know
the<00:01:54.890> here's<00:01:55.890> my<00:01:56.040> SJ<00:01:56.939> 75<00:01:57.570> as<00:01:57.780> well<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.259> just<00:01:58.290> to

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
the here's my SJ 75 as well so just to

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.160 
the here's my SJ 75 as well so just to
give<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> little<00:01:59.549> bit<00:01:59.909> of<00:01:59.969> size<00:02:00.570> comparison

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
give a little bit of size comparison

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.209 
give a little bit of size comparison
there<00:02:01.909> so<00:02:02.909> you<00:02:02.969> know<00:02:03.240> maybe<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.899> SJ<00:02:04.170> 75<00:02:04.710> is<00:02:04.950> the

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
there so you know maybe the SJ 75 is the

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.459 
there so you know maybe the SJ 75 is the
one<00:02:05.909> bigger<00:02:06.210> but<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.630> know<00:02:06.869> in<00:02:06.960> terms<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.350> the

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
one bigger but you know in terms of the

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.630 
one bigger but you know in terms of the
size<00:02:07.740> differences<00:02:08.459> you<00:02:09.330> know

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
size differences you know

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.110 
size differences you know
or<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:10.149> shape<00:02:10.800> similarities<00:02:11.800> between<00:02:12.120> these

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
or the shape similarities between these

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.150 
or the shape similarities between these
knives<00:02:13.390> I'll<00:02:13.930> just<00:02:14.080> break<00:02:14.290> out<00:02:14.470> this<00:02:14.770> is<00:02:14.950> my

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
knives I'll just break out this is my

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.770 
knives I'll just break out this is my
xmf<00:02:15.700> tanto<00:02:16.240> right<00:02:17.050> here<00:02:17.440> so<00:02:18.210> obviously<00:02:19.210> these

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
xmf tanto right here so obviously these

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.300 
xmf tanto right here so obviously these
are<00:02:20.020> all<00:02:20.050> in<00:02:20.320> the<00:02:20.440> same<00:02:20.470> family<00:02:21.090> right<00:02:22.090> there

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
are all in the same family right there

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.710 
are all in the same family right there
you<00:02:24.310> know<00:02:24.340> with<00:02:24.520> the<00:02:24.670> handle<00:02:24.940> shape<00:02:25.150> and<00:02:25.570> all

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
you know with the handle shape and all

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.080 
you know with the handle shape and all
those<00:02:25.930> things<00:02:26.170> so<00:02:26.550> quite<00:02:27.550> a<00:02:27.580> bit<00:02:27.850> smaller

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
those things so quite a bit smaller

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.640 
those things so quite a bit smaller
quite<00:02:28.630> a<00:02:28.660> bit<00:02:28.930> thinner<00:02:29.760> than<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.900> SMG<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:32.560> the

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
quite a bit thinner than the SMG and the

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.430 
quite a bit thinner than the SMG and the
SMF<00:02:33.250> but<00:02:36.090> you<00:02:37.090> know<00:02:37.209> and<00:02:37.450> I<00:02:37.750> think<00:02:37.840> you<00:02:38.320> know

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
SMF but you know and I think you know

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.100 
SMF but you know and I think you know
the<00:02:38.830> reason<00:02:38.980> that<00:02:39.220> I'm<00:02:39.660> kind<00:02:40.660> of<00:02:40.720> bringing

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
the reason that I'm kind of bringing

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.920 
the reason that I'm kind of bringing
this<00:02:41.230> out<00:02:41.410> or<00:02:41.920> bringing<00:02:42.190> this<00:02:42.310> up<00:02:42.580> is<00:02:42.910> when<00:02:43.900> I

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
this out or bringing this up is when I

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.530 
this out or bringing this up is when I
when<00:02:44.800> I<00:02:44.830> did<00:02:45.310> my<00:02:45.459> review<00:02:45.970> on<00:02:46.330> the<00:02:48.420> what's<00:02:49.420> it

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
when I did my review on the what's it

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.850 
when I did my review on the what's it
called<00:02:49.570> the<00:02:49.989> hinder<00:02:50.470> knives<00:02:51.540> 3-inch<00:02:52.540> XM<00:02:53.110> 18<00:02:53.560> I

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
called the hinder knives 3-inch XM 18 I

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.490 
called the hinder knives 3-inch XM 18 I
was<00:02:54.790> so<00:02:55.270> completely<00:02:57.600> underwhelmed<00:02:58.600> by<00:02:58.840> that

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
was so completely underwhelmed by that

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:06.270 
was so completely underwhelmed by that
knife<00:03:00.239> definitely<00:03:01.239> it's<00:03:01.420> a<00:03:01.540> very<00:03:02.850> capable<00:03:05.280> EDC

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
knife definitely it's a very capable EDC

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.160 
knife definitely it's a very capable EDC
blade<00:03:06.670> you<00:03:07.060> know<00:03:07.180> it'll<00:03:07.450> do<00:03:07.600> all<00:03:07.630> the<00:03:07.959> cutting

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.560 
blade you know it'll do all the cutting
tasks<00:03:09.690> but<00:03:10.690> you<00:03:10.810> know<00:03:10.930> again<00:03:11.200> when<00:03:11.410> it<00:03:11.530> came<00:03:11.709> to

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
tasks but you know again when it came to

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.470 
tasks but you know again when it came to

this hard
user<00:03:20.160> knife<00:03:21.160> and<00:03:21.580> it's<00:03:22.060> just<00:03:22.299> it's<00:03:22.480> just<00:03:22.540> not

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
user knife and it's just it's just not

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.420 
user knife and it's just it's just not
you<00:03:23.200> know<00:03:23.230> the<00:03:23.590> 3-inch<00:03:24.190> X<00:03:24.610> M<00:03:24.760> 18<00:03:24.930> was<00:03:25.930> not<00:03:26.430> the

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
you know the 3-inch X M 18 was not the

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.930 
you know the 3-inch X M 18 was not the
and<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.630> strata<00:03:28.870> PT<00:03:29.320> is<00:03:29.860> not<00:03:30.160> as<00:03:30.370> well<00:03:30.580> you

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
and the strata PT is not as well you

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.960 
and the strata PT is not as well you
know<00:03:31.030> but<00:03:31.450> at<00:03:32.230> the<00:03:32.380> same<00:03:32.560> time<00:03:32.799> it's<00:03:33.370> a<00:03:33.549> it<00:03:33.790> is<00:03:33.850> a

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
know but at the same time it's a it is a

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.449 
know but at the same time it's a it is a
cool<00:03:34.269> knife<00:03:34.480> you<00:03:34.870> know<00:03:34.989> if<00:03:35.620> you<00:03:35.830> guys<00:03:35.980> are

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
cool knife you know if you guys are

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.110 
cool knife you know if you guys are
looking<00:03:37.299> for<00:03:37.510> sub<00:03:38.500> three<00:03:38.860> inch<00:03:39.070> blades<00:03:39.910> you

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
looking for sub three inch blades you

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.039 
looking for sub three inch blades you
know<00:03:40.209> this<00:03:40.390> is<00:03:40.510> a<00:03:41.280> 2.75<00:03:42.280> inch<00:03:42.640> blade<00:03:44.580> so<00:03:45.580> that's

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
know this is a 2.75 inch blade so that's

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.140 
know this is a 2.75 inch blade so that's
probably<00:03:47.049> legal<00:03:47.769> in<00:03:47.920> most<00:03:48.340> pretty<00:03:49.000> much

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
probably legal in most pretty much

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.320 
probably legal in most pretty much
everywhere<00:03:49.570> in<00:03:49.630> the<00:03:50.019> states<00:03:50.320> I<00:03:50.470> would<00:03:50.620> think

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
everywhere in the states I would think

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.479 
everywhere in the states I would think
and<00:03:52.330> then<00:03:52.810> in<00:03:53.290> terms<00:03:53.709> of<00:03:53.890> actual<00:03:54.190> cutting

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
and then in terms of actual cutting

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.810 
and then in terms of actual cutting
length<00:03:54.820> you<00:03:55.060> get<00:03:55.150> it's<00:03:55.510> like<00:03:55.810> what<00:03:56.670> 2.2<00:03:57.670> and

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
length you get it's like what 2.2 and

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.000 
length you get it's like what 2.2 and
3/8<00:03:58.330> inches<00:03:58.510> you<00:03:58.989> know<00:03:59.110> so<00:03:59.290> you<00:03:59.350> have<00:03:59.620> it<00:03:59.799> you

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
3/8 inches you know so you have it you

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.800 
3/8 inches you know so you have it you
can<00:04:00.040> have<00:04:00.190> a<00:04:00.340> finger<00:04:00.760> trial<00:04:01.030> and<00:04:01.269> a<00:04:01.330> blade<00:04:01.570> this

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
can have a finger trial and a blade this

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.070 
can have a finger trial and a blade this
small<00:04:02.549> a<00:04:03.549> very<00:04:03.970> functional<00:04:04.570> trial<00:04:04.810> probably

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
small a very functional trial probably

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.900 
small a very functional trial probably
more<00:04:05.530> functional<00:04:06.040> than<00:04:06.070> the<00:04:06.280> hinder<00:04:06.610> because

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
more functional than the hinder because

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.400 
more functional than the hinder because
the<00:04:07.030> inter<00:04:07.239> has<00:04:07.390> the<00:04:07.540> edge<00:04:07.660> that<00:04:07.959> goes<00:04:08.110> all<00:04:08.380> the

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
the inter has the edge that goes all the

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.190 
the inter has the edge that goes all the
way<00:04:08.530> up<00:04:08.799> there<00:04:09.209> and<00:04:10.209> then<00:04:10.570> jimping<00:04:11.079> is

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
way up there and then jimping is

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.380 
way up there and then jimping is
actually<00:04:11.560> really<00:04:11.829> good<00:04:12.130> here<00:04:12.549> so<00:04:12.730> it<00:04:13.150> locks

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
actually really good here so it locks

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.440 
actually really good here so it locks
your<00:04:13.989> hand<00:04:14.320> in<00:04:14.530> I've<00:04:14.769> got<00:04:15.250> a<00:04:15.370> full<00:04:15.730> forefinger

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
your hand in I've got a full forefinger

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.750 
your hand in I've got a full forefinger
grip<00:04:16.810> on<00:04:17.260> a<00:04:17.320> knife<00:04:17.979> this<00:04:18.489> small<00:04:19.590> hmm<00:04:20.680> so<00:04:20.919> I

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:23.920 
as a little big knife it is a good

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.980 
as a little big knife it is a good
option<00:04:24.130> you<00:04:24.670> know<00:04:24.760> you<00:04:24.850> couldn't<00:04:25.330> easily<00:04:25.510> drop

the pocket clip off because originally I

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.640 
the pocket clip off because originally I
was<00:04:30.370> thinking<00:04:30.400> I<00:04:30.730> would<00:04:30.790> do<00:04:31.120> that<00:04:31.650> ultimately

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
was thinking I would do that ultimately

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.120 
was thinking I would do that ultimately
I<00:04:32.710> just<00:04:33.010> feel<00:04:33.850> like<00:04:33.970> the<00:04:34.090> Petey's<00:04:34.450> not<00:04:34.950> for<00:04:35.950> me

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
I just feel like the Petey's not for me

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.020 
I just feel like the Petey's not for me
but<00:04:37.110> that<00:04:38.110> aside<00:04:38.470> it<00:04:38.920> is<00:04:38.950> a<00:04:39.100> great<00:04:39.490> knife<00:04:39.700> it's

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
but that aside it is a great knife it's

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.280 
but that aside it is a great knife it's
smooth<00:04:40.840> and<00:04:41.320> I'm<00:04:41.890> actually<00:04:42.070> felt<00:04:42.520> the<00:04:42.580> custom

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
smooth and I'm actually felt the custom

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.400 
smooth and I'm actually felt the custom
PT<00:04:44.290> CC<00:04:44.910> version<00:04:45.910> and<00:04:46.270> that<00:04:46.570> was<00:04:46.750> amazing<00:04:47.050> it

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
PT CC version and that was amazing it

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.800 
PT CC version and that was amazing it
was<00:04:47.500> so<00:04:47.560> smooth<00:04:48.190> if<00:04:48.940> I<00:04:49.090> had<00:04:49.270> that<00:04:49.420> version

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
was so smooth if I had that version

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.310 
was so smooth if I had that version
maybe<00:04:50.020> I<00:04:50.140> would<00:04:50.350> want<00:04:50.830> to<00:04:50.890> keep<00:04:51.040> that<00:04:51.250> but

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
maybe I would want to keep that but

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.740 
maybe I would want to keep that but

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
know falling into your pocket so it

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.710 
know falling into your pocket so it
doesn't<00:05:35.230> seem<00:05:35.410> like<00:05:35.620> it's<00:05:35.800> you<00:05:36.460> know<00:05:36.580> that<00:05:36.970> big

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
of a deal but on a PT it almost feels

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.770 
of a deal but on a PT it almost feels
like<00:05:41.410> half<00:05:41.890> of<00:05:42.010> the<00:05:42.160> knife<00:05:42.310> at<00:05:42.670> least<00:05:42.880> you<00:05:43.660> know

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
don't feel very secure because there's

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.750 
don't feel very secure because there's
more<00:05:52.900> weight<00:05:53.320> I<00:05:53.680> feel<00:05:54.280> like<00:05:54.340> there's<00:05:54.580> more
