a 2006 h1 Hummer the unique thing about

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.390 
a 2006 h1 Hummer the unique thing about
the<00:00:11.910> Alpha<00:00:12.269> is<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:13.110> last<00:00:13.410> model<00:00:13.950> year<00:00:14.190> that

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
the Alpha is the last model year that

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.519 
the Alpha is the last model year that
they<00:00:14.490> ever<00:00:14.670> had<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.660> h1<00:00:16.020> Hummer<00:00:16.170> in

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
they ever had the h1 Hummer in

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.220 
they ever had the h1 Hummer in
production<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.250> they<00:00:17.730> made<00:00:17.910> it<00:00:18.029> with<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.390> LOI

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
production and they made it with the LOI

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.050 
production and they made it with the LOI
Duramax<00:00:20.070> engine<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.730> Allison

Duramax engine and the Allison

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.290 
Duramax engine and the Allison
five-speed<00:00:21.539> so<00:00:22.230> it's<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.590> great<00:00:22.949> engine<00:00:23.340> combo

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
five-speed so it's a great engine combo

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.929 
five-speed so it's a great engine combo
on<00:00:25.050> this<00:00:25.230> truck<00:00:25.470> we've<00:00:25.740> got<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.130> sixteen<00:00:26.670> five

and integrated light bar the thing about
this<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.210> can<00:00:33.300> see<00:00:33.480> it's<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.630> little<00:00:33.780> bit

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
this is you can see it's a little bit

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.930 
this is you can see it's a little bit
different<00:00:34.350> from<00:00:34.440> our<00:00:34.590> standard<00:00:35.010> winch<00:00:35.610> buffer

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940

different from our standard winch buffer
system<00:00:36.300> at<00:00:36.750> sixteen<00:00:37.290> five<00:00:37.530> it's<00:00:37.890> just<00:00:38.010> got<00:00:38.129> a

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
system at sixteen five it's just got a

massive winch in the back just way too

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.500 
massive winch in the back just way too
much<00:00:40.680> power<00:00:40.920> it's<00:00:41.070> pretty<00:00:41.250> cool<00:00:41.399> though<00:00:41.550> but

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
much power it's pretty cool though but

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.000 
much power it's pretty cool though but
you<00:00:42.600> can<00:00:42.750> see<00:00:42.899> it's<00:00:43.050> kind<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.500> little<00:00:43.920> bit

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
you can see it's kind of a little bit

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.529 
you can see it's kind of a little bit
more<00:00:44.160> pronounced<00:00:44.610> here<00:00:44.789> we<00:00:44.969> have<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.300> center

the vehicle wasn't impaired by a snorkel
coming<00:01:32.430> straight<00:01:32.670> up<00:01:32.729> now<00:01:33.030> if<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.180> can

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
coming straight up now if you can

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.640 
coming straight up now if you can

imagine this guy coming straight up

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.130 
imagine this guy coming straight up
would<00:01:35.520> actually<00:01:35.820> be<00:01:35.909> just<00:01:36.180> about<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:36.960> writing

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
would actually be just about and writing

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.300 
would actually be just about and writing
directly<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.650> front<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:38.189> you're

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
directly in front of you so you're

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.710 
directly in front of you so you're
constantly<00:01:38.520> leaning<00:01:38.880> in<00:01:39.210> looking<00:01:39.659> around

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
constantly leaning in looking around

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.660 
constantly leaning in looking around
this<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.530> snorkel<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.250> offset

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
this the snorkel so the offset

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.569 
this the snorkel so the offset
historical<00:01:42.360> makes<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.600> big<00:01:42.750> difference<00:01:43.049> there

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
historical makes a big difference there

have our air intake right here and the
biggest<00:03:25.830> benefit<00:03:26.280> there<00:03:26.519> is<00:03:26.700> it's<00:03:26.880> just<00:03:27.030> kind

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
biggest benefit there is it's just kind

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.240 
biggest benefit there is it's just kind
of<00:03:27.239> a<00:03:27.360> forced<00:03:27.750> air<00:03:27.930> induction<00:03:28.200> system<00:03:28.410> it

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
of a forced air induction system it

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.280 
of a forced air induction system it
allows<00:03:29.519> the<00:03:29.850> air<00:03:29.970> to<00:03:30.000> be<00:03:30.209> forced<00:03:30.750> in<00:03:30.900> here<00:03:31.110> and

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
allows the air to be forced in here and

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.740 
allows the air to be forced in here and
doesn't<00:03:31.620> come<00:03:31.800> out<00:03:31.830> the<00:03:32.070> back<00:03:32.280> side<00:03:32.600> years<00:03:33.600> and

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
doesn't come out the back side years and

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.330 
doesn't come out the back side years and
years<00:03:33.930> ago<00:03:34.140> we<00:03:34.260> did<00:03:34.380> some<00:03:34.530> Windtunnel<00:03:34.920> testing

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
years ago we did some Windtunnel testing

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.070 
years ago we did some Windtunnel testing
and<00:03:35.610> we<00:03:35.850> found<00:03:36.030> that<00:03:36.269> there<00:03:36.570> was<00:03:36.630> a<00:03:36.690> lot<00:03:36.870> of<00:03:36.900> air

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
and we found that there was a lot of air

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.900 
and we found that there was a lot of air
coming<00:03:37.110> in<00:03:37.500> here<00:03:37.800> a<00:03:37.890> little<00:03:38.370> bit<00:03:38.459> coming<00:03:38.640> in<00:03:38.820> on

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
coming in here a little bit coming in on

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.550 
coming in here a little bit coming in on
the<00:03:38.970> front<00:03:39.150> side<00:03:39.330> and<00:03:39.510> a<00:03:39.870> lot<00:03:40.140> of<00:03:40.170> air<00:03:40.350> coming

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
the front side and a lot of air coming

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.810 
the front side and a lot of air coming
out<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:40.860> back<00:03:41.010> side<00:03:41.280> so<00:03:41.459> it's<00:03:41.580> kind<00:03:41.760> of

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
out the back side so it's kind of

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.910 
out the back side so it's kind of
flowing<00:03:42.239> in<00:03:42.390> from<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:42.959> bottom<00:03:43.110> popping<00:03:43.830> out

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
flowing in from the bottom popping out

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.080 
flowing in from the bottom popping out
the<00:03:44.040> top<00:03:44.250> so<00:03:45.380> it<00:03:46.380> does<00:03:46.650> duct<00:03:47.010> air<00:03:47.250> in<00:03:47.489> but<00:03:47.940> it

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
the top so it does duct air in but it

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.640 
the top so it does duct air in but it
also<00:03:48.239> stops<00:03:48.690> and<00:03:48.959> blocks<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.290> air<00:03:49.470> from

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
also stops and blocks the air from

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
also stops and blocks the air from
actually<00:03:50.010> traveling<00:03:50.400> out<00:03:50.549> so<00:03:51.330> very<00:03:51.989> effective

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
actually traveling out so very effective

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.789 
actually traveling out so very effective
coming<00:03:53.670> up<00:03:53.850> -<00:03:53.940> they're<00:03:54.060> our<00:03:54.150> d-ring<00:03:54.570> mounts

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
coming up - they're our d-ring mounts

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:58.789 
coming up - they're our d-ring mounts
these<00:03:55.799> are<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.360> upgraded<00:03:57.360> d-ring<00:03:57.690> mounts<00:03:57.930> the

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
these are the upgraded d-ring mounts the

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.979 
these are the upgraded d-ring mounts the
airlift<00:03:59.040> hooks<00:03:59.310> just<00:03:59.549> kind<00:04:00.480> of<00:04:00.540> over<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:00.959> top

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
airlift hooks just kind of over the top

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.590 
airlift hooks just kind of over the top
again<00:04:01.470> one<00:04:01.739> inch<00:04:01.920> thick<00:04:01.980> it's<00:04:02.370> actually<00:04:02.760> we

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
again one inch thick it's actually we

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.420 
again one inch thick it's actually we
mimic<00:04:03.959> the<00:04:04.310> military<00:04:05.989> m<00:04:06.989> 1152<00:04:07.799> Air<00:04:08.010> Lift<00:04:08.190> hooks

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
mimic the military m 1152 Air Lift hooks

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.009 
mimic the military m 1152 Air Lift hooks
when<00:04:08.880> they<00:04:09.000> went<00:04:09.209> to<00:04:09.269> the<00:04:09.330> upgraded<00:04:09.900> up

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
when they went to the upgraded up

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.870 
when they went to the upgraded up
armored<00:04:10.380> vehicles<00:04:10.799> they<00:04:11.430> came<00:04:11.640> out<00:04:11.670> with

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
armored vehicles they came out with

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.220 
armored vehicles they came out with
these<00:04:12.000> heavy-duty<00:04:12.299> airlift<00:04:12.810> hooks<00:04:12.989> and

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
these heavy-duty airlift hooks and

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.320 
these heavy-duty airlift hooks and
that's<00:04:13.739> what<00:04:13.920> we've<00:04:14.070> done<00:04:14.100> here<00:04:14.580> except<00:04:15.090> ours

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
that's what we've done here except ours

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.050 
that's what we've done here except ours
are<00:04:15.600> another<00:04:16.049> quarter<00:04:16.440> inch<00:04:16.560> thicker<00:04:16.910> just<00:04:17.910> a

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
are another quarter inch thicker just a

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.270 
are another quarter inch thicker just a
little<00:04:18.330> bit<00:04:18.510> better<00:04:19.200> fit<00:04:19.620> and<00:04:19.739> finish<00:04:20.070> and

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
little bit better fit and finish and

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.339 
little bit better fit and finish and
overall<00:04:20.880> look<00:04:21.120> and<00:04:21.359> then<00:04:21.690> you<00:04:21.720> also<00:04:21.900> have<00:04:22.200> the

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
overall look and then you also have the

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:24.960 
overall look and then you also have the
cover<00:04:22.919> place<00:04:23.160> for<00:04:23.400> and<00:04:23.550> the<00:04:23.610> cover<00:04:23.820> up<00:04:24.000> the
