circular<00:01:09.840> aspect<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.100> way<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.580> verse

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
circular aspect of the way the verse

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:24.920 
circular aspect of the way the verse
rolls

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.020 

wayward<00:01:25.930> cane<00:01:26.229> is<00:01:26.469> actually<00:01:26.920> it<00:01:27.490> was<00:01:27.610> a<00:01:27.640> band

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
wayward cane is actually it was a band

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.109 
wayward cane is actually it was a band
around<00:01:28.899> in<00:01:29.259> the<00:01:29.320> early<00:01:29.590> punk<00:01:29.829> days<00:01:30.070> down<00:01:30.579> in<00:01:30.610> OC

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
around in the early punk days down in OC

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.230 
around in the early punk days down in OC
so<00:01:31.810> what<00:01:31.960> it<00:01:32.049> turned<00:01:32.259> into<00:01:33.000> essentially<00:01:34.000> is

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
so what it turned into essentially is

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.899 
so what it turned into essentially is
just<00:01:34.630> a<00:01:35.259> song<00:01:35.530> about<00:01:35.829> times<00:01:36.250> in<00:01:36.429> life<00:01:36.579> when<00:01:36.820> I

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
just a song about times in life when I

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.240 
just a song about times in life when I
when<00:01:37.179> you<00:01:37.299> might<00:01:37.450> make<00:01:37.630> some<00:01:37.840> sort<00:01:38.619> of<00:01:38.710> selfish

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
when you might make some sort of selfish

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.760 
when you might make some sort of selfish
decisions<00:01:41.039> it's<00:01:42.039> kind<00:01:42.310> of<00:01:42.340> act<00:01:42.520> like<00:01:42.670> a<00:01:42.700> jerk

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
decisions it's kind of act like a jerk

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.050 
decisions it's kind of act like a jerk
you<00:01:44.770> could<00:01:44.890> take<00:01:45.069> a<00:01:45.100> tune<00:01:45.369> and<00:01:45.520> you<00:01:45.610> could<00:01:45.759> you

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
you could take a tune and you could you

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.230 
you could take a tune and you could you
could<00:01:46.270> present<00:01:47.259> it<00:01:47.560> in<00:01:47.679> any<00:01:48.310> different<00:01:48.579> manner

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
could present it in any different manner

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.090 
could present it in any different manner
of<00:01:49.689> ways<00:01:49.960> you<00:01:50.590> know<00:01:50.679> it<00:01:50.770> could<00:01:50.890> have<00:01:50.979> been<00:01:51.039> a

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
of ways you know it could have been a

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.130 
of ways you know it could have been a
punk<00:01:51.399> song<00:01:51.670> really<00:01:52.060> or<00:01:52.270> a<00:01:52.329> rock-and-roll<00:01:52.539> -

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
punk song really or a rock-and-roll -

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.669 
punk song really or a rock-and-roll -
nor<00:01:53.469> I<00:01:54.000> think<00:01:55.000> the<00:01:55.119> way<00:01:55.240> I'm<00:01:55.390> gonna<00:01:55.560> do<00:01:56.560> it

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
nor I think the way I'm gonna do it

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:58.440 
nor I think the way I'm gonna do it
today<00:01:56.860> is<00:01:57.159> just<00:01:57.369> more<00:01:57.610> of<00:01:57.700> a<00:01:57.759> folk<00:01:58.030> version

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
today is just more of a folk version

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.300 
today is just more of a folk version
it's<00:01:58.840> different<00:01:59.140> than<00:01:59.319> that<00:01:59.470> album<00:01:59.860> version

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
it's different than that album version

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.160 
it's different than that album version
they<00:02:00.670> usually<00:02:00.819> start<00:02:01.270> with<00:02:01.360> the<00:02:01.479> melody<00:02:01.929> for

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
they usually start with the melody for

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.660 
they usually start with the melody for
me<00:02:02.200> and<00:02:02.500> I<00:02:02.560> think<00:02:02.619> that's<00:02:02.920> the<00:02:03.069> case<00:02:03.250> with<00:02:03.459> a

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
me and I think that's the case with a

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.399 
me and I think that's the case with a
lot<00:02:03.939> of<00:02:03.970> songwriters<00:02:04.509> you<00:02:04.929> pick<00:02:05.110> up<00:02:05.259> your

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
lot of songwriters you pick up your

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:06.809 
lot of songwriters you pick up your
guitar<00:02:05.500> and<00:02:05.890> he<00:02:05.950> starts<00:02:06.250> to<00:02:06.369> playing<00:02:06.610> some

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:06.819 
guitar and he starts to playing some

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:09.740 
guitar and he starts to playing some
