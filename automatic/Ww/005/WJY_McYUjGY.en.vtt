I feel like I've said the names so much
it<00:01:07.950> just<00:01:08.220> kind<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.659> doesn't<00:01:09.659> matter<00:01:09.810> her

sure<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.520> guys<00:01:47.579> can<00:01:47.909> guess<00:01:48.060> what<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.390> is

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
sure you guys can guess what this is

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.859 
sure you guys can guess what this is
and<00:01:49.040> it's<00:01:50.040> well<00:01:50.579> dressed<00:01:51.030> which<00:01:51.329> is<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.540> really

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
and it's well dressed which is a really

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.999 
and it's well dressed which is a really
light<00:01:52.290> kind<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.829> cool<00:01:53.130> tone<00:01:54.020> pink<00:01:55.020> blush<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.799> I

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
light kind of cool tone pink blush and I

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.209 
light kind of cool tone pink blush and I
use<00:01:56.280> this<00:01:56.810> pretty<00:01:57.810> much<00:01:57.990> on<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.170> daily<00:01:58.439> basis<00:01:59.070> I

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
use this pretty much on a daily basis I

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.899 
use this pretty much on a daily basis I
really<00:01:59.610> like<00:01:59.759> it<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.689> satin<00:02:01.140> finish

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
really like it it is a satin finish

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:03.819 
really like it it is a satin finish
so<00:02:02.030> does<00:02:02.210> it<00:02:02.240> have<00:02:02.539> a<00:02:02.570> lot<00:02:02.899> of<00:02:02.960> shimmer<00:02:03.380> in<00:02:03.679> it

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
so does it have a lot of shimmer in it

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.270 
so does it have a lot of shimmer in it
and<00:02:04.069> this<00:02:04.909> just<00:02:05.210> gives<00:02:05.509> a<00:02:05.749> really<00:02:05.810> nice<00:02:06.530> light

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
and this just gives a really nice light

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.969 
and this just gives a really nice light
pink<00:02:07.490> flush<00:02:08.149> across<00:02:08.539> the<00:02:08.780> cheeks<00:02:09.080> does<00:02:09.830> it

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
pink flush across the cheeks does it

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.009 
pink flush across the cheeks does it
make<00:02:10.099> you<00:02:10.220> look<00:02:10.340> overdone<00:02:10.729> I<00:02:11.150> used<00:02:11.450> this<00:02:11.720> a<00:02:11.959> lot

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
make you look overdone I used this a lot

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.589 
make you look overdone I used this a lot
I<00:02:12.290> probably<00:02:12.560> use<00:02:13.010> it<00:02:13.220> more<00:02:13.879> than<00:02:13.910> deep<00:02:14.299> throat

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
I probably use it more than deep throat

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.869 
I probably use it more than deep throat
right<00:02:14.810> now<00:02:14.840> just<00:02:15.200> because<00:02:15.379> my<00:02:16.099> skin<00:02:16.370> is<00:02:16.610> really

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
right now just because my skin is really

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:18.729 
right now just because my skin is really
light<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.180> this<00:02:17.599> tends<00:02:18.049> to<00:02:18.170> look<00:02:18.379> a<00:02:18.530> little

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
light and this tends to look a little

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.030 
light and this tends to look a little
bit<00:02:18.980> better<00:02:19.160> right<00:02:19.489> now<00:02:19.700> but<00:02:20.599> as<00:02:21.230> my<00:02:21.560> skin<00:02:21.830> gets

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
bit better right now but as my skin gets

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.509 
bit better right now but as my skin gets
darker<00:02:22.280> I<00:02:22.700> will<00:02:22.879> put<00:02:23.330> more<00:02:23.540> into<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.620> deep

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
darker I will put more into the deep

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.420 
darker I will put more into the deep
throat<00:02:25.910> territory<00:02:26.629> which<00:02:27.290> sounds<00:02:28.099> kind<00:02:28.370> of

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
throat territory which sounds kind of

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:35.110 
throat territory which sounds kind of
bad<00:02:28.670> but<00:02:28.970> okay<00:02:30.640> moving<00:02:31.640> on<00:02:32.590> so<00:02:33.730> which<00:02:34.730> one<00:02:34.910> do<00:02:35.030> I

territory<00:04:30.010> because<00:04:30.250> I<00:04:30.310> know

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
territory because I know

peaches<00:04:31.120> are<00:04:31.270> really<00:04:31.660> in<00:04:31.840> this<00:04:32.050> season<00:04:32.610> and

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
peaches are really in this season and

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.520 
peaches are really in this season and
now<00:04:33.790> the<00:04:34.420> last<00:04:34.720> blush<00:04:35.140> I<00:04:35.410> have<00:04:35.710> is<00:04:35.980> kind<00:04:36.910> of

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
now the last blush I have is kind of

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.900 
now the last blush I have is kind of
scary<00:04:38.530> when<00:04:38.800> you<00:04:38.950> look<00:04:39.130> at<00:04:39.310> it<00:04:39.490> in<00:04:39.670> the

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
scary when you look at it in the

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.940 
scary when you look at it in the
packaging<00:04:40.420> and<00:04:40.600> this<00:04:40.900> was<00:04:41.110> also<00:04:41.320> by<00:04:41.590> NARS<00:04:41.830> I

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
packaging and this was also by NARS I

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.890 
packaging and this was also by NARS I
know<00:04:42.040> I<00:04:42.160> have<00:04:42.340> a<00:04:42.400> lot<00:04:42.580> of<00:04:42.610> NARS<00:04:42.880> blushes<00:04:43.420> but<00:04:43.630> I

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
know I have a lot of NARS blushes but I

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.220 
know I have a lot of NARS blushes but I
think<00:04:44.230> NARS<00:04:44.560> makes<00:04:44.920> really<00:04:45.280> good<00:04:45.490> blushes

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
think NARS makes really good blushes

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.990 
think NARS makes really good blushes
they're<00:04:47.230> really<00:04:47.500> famous<00:04:47.680> for<00:04:48.310> them<00:04:48.520> they're

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
need to use a lot at one time and they

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.050 
need to use a lot at one time and they
last<00:04:53.080> forever<00:04:53.470> and<00:04:53.920> their<00:04:54.130> color<00:04:54.370> selection
