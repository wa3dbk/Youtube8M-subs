hello<00:00:02.050> we're<00:00:02.439> back<00:00:02.649> for<00:00:02.860> our<00:00:02.980> first<00:00:03.370> update<00:00:03.610> on

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:04.090 
hello we're back for our first update on

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.070 
hello we're back for our first update on
the<00:00:04.330> conversion<00:00:06.090> as<00:00:07.090> you<00:00:07.240> can<00:00:07.420> see<00:00:07.570> here<00:00:07.780> I

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.080 
the conversion as you can see here I

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.950 
the conversion as you can see here I
moved<00:00:09.070> only<00:00:09.520> with<00:00:09.700> the<00:00:09.850> build<00:00:10.720> model<00:00:12.720> as<00:00:13.720> I

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:13.960 
moved only with the build model as I

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.230 
moved only with the build model as I
mentioned<00:00:14.380> previously<00:00:14.559> I<00:00:14.980> cut<00:00:15.280> the<00:00:15.700> hull<00:00:16.030> in

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:16.240 
mentioned previously I cut the hull in

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.460 
mentioned previously I cut the hull in
two<00:00:16.420> parts<00:00:16.869> each<00:00:18.119> shall<00:00:19.119> half<00:00:19.390> before<00:00:19.900> doing

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.470 
two parts each shall half before doing

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.340 
two parts each shall half before doing
that<00:00:20.590> together<00:00:20.740> I<00:00:21.070> cut<00:00:21.310> them<00:00:21.520> a<00:00:21.880> long<00:00:22.210> line<00:00:22.539> in

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.350 
that together I cut them a long line in

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.950 
that together I cut them a long line in
there<00:00:23.560> in<00:00:24.250> part<00:00:24.580> one<00:00:25.150> of<00:00:25.180> this<00:00:25.360> series<00:00:27.930> then<00:00:28.930> I

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
there in part one of this series then I

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.980 
there in part one of this series then I
went<00:00:29.170> ahead<00:00:29.439> and<00:00:29.890> I<00:00:30.520> give<00:00:30.730> the<00:00:30.880> two<00:00:31.090> back<00:00:31.600> parts

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:31.990 
went ahead and I give the two back parts

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
went ahead and I give the two back parts
together<00:00:34.289> and<00:00:36.659> this<00:00:37.659> top<00:00:38.079> part<00:00:38.350> actually

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
together and this top part actually

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.040 
together and this top part actually
consists<00:00:39.489> of<00:00:39.550> this<00:00:39.760> piece<00:00:40.120> and<00:00:40.449> this<00:00:40.989> piece

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
consists of this piece and this piece

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.160 
consists of this piece and this piece
overhead<00:00:41.889> here<00:00:42.370> and<00:00:42.629> it's<00:00:43.629> a<00:00:43.749> bit<00:00:43.870> of<00:00:44.050> a

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
overhead here and it's a bit of a

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.439 
overhead here and it's a bit of a
personal<00:00:44.889> choice<00:00:45.069> if<00:00:45.399> you<00:00:45.519> want<00:00:45.729> to<00:00:45.879> have<00:00:46.089> all

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
personal choice if you want to have all

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:48.719 
personal choice if you want to have all
these<00:00:46.690> things<00:00:47.379> back<00:00:47.829> here<00:00:48.159> then<00:00:48.429> you<00:00:48.549> just

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:48.729 
these things back here then you just

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:52.559 
these things back here then you just
glue<00:00:48.969> it<00:00:49.089> on<00:00:49.299> or<00:00:49.960> as<00:00:50.589> I<00:00:50.799> did<00:00:51.010> I<00:00:51.249> cut<00:00:52.120> along<00:00:52.389> the

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:52.569 
glue it on or as I did I cut along the

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:54.629 
glue it on or as I did I cut along the
panel<00:00:53.019> line<00:00:53.170> and<00:00:53.440> divide<00:00:53.679> it<00:00:53.859> into<00:00:54.069> two<00:00:54.429> pieces

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:54.639 
panel line and divide it into two pieces

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:58.319 
panel line and divide it into two pieces
and<00:00:55.059> put<00:00:55.239> the<00:00:56.199> aerial<00:00:56.469> array<00:00:57.010> down<00:00:57.309> here<00:00:58.119> at

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
and put the aerial array down here at

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.569 
and put the aerial array down here at
the<00:00:58.449> back<00:00:58.690> and<00:00:59.049> the<00:00:59.549> intake<00:01:01.289> things<00:01:02.429> in<00:01:03.429> the

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
the back and the intake things in the

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.330 
the back and the intake things in the
front<00:01:04.050> then<00:01:05.050> you<00:01:05.170> just<00:01:05.350> cut<00:01:05.710> out<00:01:05.920> plastic

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
front then you just cut out plastic

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.320 
front then you just cut out plastic
harder<00:01:07.060> to<00:01:07.870> perform<00:01:08.110> to<00:01:08.710> the<00:01:09.060> lines<00:01:10.060> you<00:01:10.300> have

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
harder to perform to the lines you have

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:16.500 
harder to perform to the lines you have
and<00:01:13.050> yeah<00:01:14.050> I<00:01:14.680> cut<00:01:15.130> out<00:01:15.160> a<00:01:15.280> piece<00:01:15.610> to<00:01:16.060> square

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.510 
and yeah I cut out a piece to square

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.840 
and yeah I cut out a piece to square
this<00:01:16.660> off<00:01:16.870> so<00:01:17.140> I<00:01:17.230> had<00:01:17.470> this<00:01:17.920> whole<00:01:17.980> thing<00:01:18.280> as

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
this off so I had this whole thing as

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.740 
this off so I had this whole thing as
one<00:01:19.090> piece<00:01:19.900> with<00:01:20.440> the<00:01:20.560> top<00:01:20.850> as<00:01:21.850> well<00:01:22.150> and<00:01:22.600> as

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
one piece with the top as well and as

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.320 
one piece with the top as well and as
you<00:01:22.780> can<00:01:23.020> see<00:01:23.080> there's<00:01:23.440> a<00:01:23.530> yawn<00:01:23.710> here<00:01:24.100> and<00:01:24.460> then

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
you can see there's a yawn here and then

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:31.800 
you can see there's a yawn here and then
I<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.780> I<00:01:28.930> measured<00:01:29.440> from<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:31.060> point<00:01:31.450> to<00:01:31.690> this

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
I and I measured from this point to this

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.180 
I and I measured from this point to this
corner<00:01:32.140> and<00:01:33.180> all<00:01:34.180> the<00:01:34.330> way<00:01:34.450> to<00:01:34.800> this<00:01:35.800> corner

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
corner and all the way to this corner

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.580 
corner and all the way to this corner
here<00:01:36.550> and<00:01:36.580> that<00:01:36.970> will<00:01:37.450> be<00:01:37.510> the<00:01:37.930> distance<00:01:38.410> you

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
here and that will be the distance you

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.480 
here and that will be the distance you
actually<00:01:39.100> lengthen<00:01:40.090> your<00:01:40.240> hull<00:01:40.510> with<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:42.280> we

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
actually lengthen your hull with so we

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.700 
actually lengthen your hull with so we
have<00:01:42.670> to<00:01:42.760> decide<00:01:43.090> for<00:01:43.240> yourself<00:01:43.600> how<00:01:43.840> long<00:01:44.050> how

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
have to decide for yourself how long how

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.430 
have to decide for yourself how long how
much<00:01:44.890> longer<00:01:45.159> you<00:01:45.370> want<00:01:45.550> to<00:01:45.670> make<00:01:45.820> it<00:01:46.440> -

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
much longer you want to make it -

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.700 
much longer you want to make it -
approximately<00:01:50.670> between<00:01:52.380> can't<00:01:53.380> remember

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
approximately between can't remember

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.010 
approximately between can't remember
exactly<00:01:54.190> but<00:01:54.280> between<00:01:55.090> seven<00:01:55.510> and<00:01:55.630> a<00:01:55.659> half<00:01:55.690> and

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
exactly but between seven and a half and

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:04.400 
exactly but between seven and a half and
eight<00:01:56.350> centimeters<00:01:57.250> longer

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.290 

while<00:02:05.410> putting<00:02:05.800> this<00:02:06.010> together<00:02:06.250> I<00:02:06.760> actually

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
while putting this together I actually

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.630 
while putting this together I actually
started<00:02:08.200> with<00:02:10.020> no<00:02:11.020> we<00:02:11.410> had<00:02:11.560> in<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.100> front<00:02:12.400> part

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
started with no we had in the front part

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.430 
started with no we had in the front part
as<00:02:12.790> well<00:02:12.940> as<00:02:13.120> you<00:02:13.210> can<00:02:13.330> see<00:02:13.510> yeah<00:02:13.660> now<00:02:14.140> I<00:02:14.170> have

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
as well as you can see yeah now I have

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.190 
as well as you can see yeah now I have
put<00:02:14.650> in<00:02:14.830> the<00:02:14.980> cockpit<00:02:15.400> and<00:02:15.810> actually<00:02:16.810> painted

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
put in the cockpit and actually painted

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.320 
put in the cockpit and actually painted
the<00:02:17.320> inside<00:02:17.500> just<00:02:17.890> for<00:02:18.100> easel<00:02:20.190> painting<00:02:21.330> but

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
the inside just for easel painting but

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.780 
the inside just for easel painting but
before<00:02:22.690> that<00:02:22.840> this<00:02:23.230> gray<00:02:23.650> area<00:02:23.680> here<00:02:24.070> you<00:02:24.550> see

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
before that this gray area here you see

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.220 
before that this gray area here you see
is<00:02:25.030> actually<00:02:25.960> the<00:02:26.080> cockpit<00:02:27.960> main<00:02:28.960> cockpit

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
is actually the cockpit main cockpit

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.420 
is actually the cockpit main cockpit
area<00:02:30.130> and<00:02:30.490> these<00:02:30.970> two<00:02:31.510> side<00:02:31.840> panels<00:02:32.220> as<00:02:33.220> you

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
area and these two side panels as you

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.380 
area and these two side panels as you
can<00:02:33.610> see<00:02:33.790> here<00:02:34.090> are<00:02:34.300> the<00:02:35.760> front<00:02:36.760> parts<00:02:37.180> of<00:02:37.300> the

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
can see here are the front parts of the

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.320 
can see here are the front parts of the
hull<00:02:37.600> that<00:02:37.780> we<00:02:37.959> cut<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:39.700> when<00:02:39.820> you<00:02:39.910> cut<00:02:40.120> them

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
hull that we cut and when you cut them

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.990 
hull that we cut and when you cut them
out<00:02:40.450> if<00:02:40.870> I<00:02:41.140> turn<00:02:41.709> up<00:02:41.740> like<00:02:42.070> this<00:02:42.310> maybe<00:02:42.730> you<00:02:42.850> can

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
out if I turn up like this maybe you can

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.090 
out if I turn up like this maybe you can
see<00:02:43.180> there<00:02:43.510> would<00:02:43.690> be<00:02:43.720> if<00:02:44.140> you<00:02:44.320> cut<00:02:44.650> them<00:02:44.890> back

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
see there would be if you cut them back

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.920 
see there would be if you cut them back
onto<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.640> line<00:02:45.850> I<00:02:45.880> showed<00:02:46.240> you<00:02:46.390> earlier<00:02:46.420> there

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
onto the line I showed you earlier there

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.850 
onto the line I showed you earlier there
will<00:02:47.050> be<00:02:47.080> a<00:02:47.230> lip<00:02:48.360> left<00:02:49.360> on<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:49.810> side<00:02:50.020> pieces<00:02:50.320> of

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
will be a lip left on the side pieces of

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.760 
will be a lip left on the side pieces of
the<00:02:51.340> hull<00:02:51.900> one<00:02:52.900> on<00:02:53.020> each<00:02:53.140> side<00:02:54.450> so<00:02:55.450> we<00:02:55.600> can<00:02:55.770> push

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
the hull one on each side so we can push

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.900 
the hull one on each side so we can push
that<00:02:57.040> up<00:02:57.220> against<00:02:57.580> the<00:02:57.790> cockpit<00:02:58.270> piece<00:02:59.910> which

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
that up against the cockpit piece which

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.390 
that up against the cockpit piece which
doesn't<00:03:01.330> have<00:03:01.480> this<00:03:01.660> area<00:03:02.080> here<00:03:02.440> you<00:03:03.160> pushed

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
doesn't have this area here you pushed

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.220 
doesn't have this area here you pushed
it<00:03:03.550> up<00:03:03.730> along<00:03:04.270> the<00:03:04.450> edge<00:03:04.660> of<00:03:04.690> the<00:03:04.989> cockpit

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
it up along the edge of the cockpit

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.780 
it up along the edge of the cockpit
piece<00:03:06.900> and<00:03:07.900> then<00:03:08.260> there<00:03:08.890> is<00:03:08.980> a<00:03:09.010> line<00:03:09.340> up<00:03:09.519> here

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
piece and then there is a line up here

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.759 
piece and then there is a line up here
that<00:03:10.000> you<00:03:10.030> will<00:03:10.239> have<00:03:10.420> to<00:03:10.600> align<00:03:11.110> under<00:03:11.590> this

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
that you will have to align under this

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:14.490 
that you will have to align under this
top<00:03:12.130> piece<00:03:12.340> here<00:03:12.370> now<00:03:12.730> but<00:03:12.940> when<00:03:13.870> you<00:03:13.989> drive<00:03:14.230> it

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
top piece here now but when you drive it

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.470 
top piece here now but when you drive it
that<00:03:14.680> you<00:03:14.800> will<00:03:14.950> see<00:03:15.160> how<00:03:15.519> it<00:03:15.670> will<00:03:15.850> how<00:03:16.300> it's

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
that you will see how it will how it's

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.080 
that you will see how it will how it's
meant<00:03:16.930> to<00:03:17.170> go<00:03:17.500> on<00:03:17.680> it's<00:03:18.040> not<00:03:18.610> very<00:03:18.910> difficult

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
meant to go on it's not very difficult

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.390 
meant to go on it's not very difficult
so<00:03:22.090> then<00:03:22.269> I<00:03:22.299> glued<00:03:22.600> on<00:03:22.780> this<00:03:23.019> both<00:03:23.290> these<00:03:23.590> side

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
so then I glued on this both these side

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.390 
so then I glued on this both these side
pieces<00:03:24.700> to<00:03:25.420> the<00:03:25.570> cockpit<00:03:26.110> area<00:03:28.500> and<00:03:29.500> then<00:03:30.280> I

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
pieces to the cockpit area and then I

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.449 
pieces to the cockpit area and then I
actually<00:03:30.580> had<00:03:31.239> this<00:03:31.570> top<00:03:32.350> section<00:03:33.010> here<00:03:33.040> and

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
actually had this top section here and

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.240 
actually had this top section here and
this<00:03:33.670> front<00:03:34.360> piece<00:03:34.600> here's<00:03:34.959> one<00:03:35.380> piece<00:03:35.769> when<00:03:36.100> I

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
this front piece here's one piece when I

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.060 
this front piece here's one piece when I
glued<00:03:36.519> a<00:03:36.640> little<00:03:37.920> strip<00:03:38.920> of<00:03:39.750> plastic<00:03:40.750> cord<00:03:41.260> to

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
glued a little strip of plastic cord to

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.660 
glued a little strip of plastic cord to
the<00:03:42.160> underside<00:03:42.700> of<00:03:42.760> this<00:03:43.030> piece<00:03:43.330> I<00:03:43.660> just<00:03:44.670> put

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
the underside of this piece I just put

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.220 
the underside of this piece I just put
it<00:03:45.790> in<00:03:45.910> there<00:03:46.120> and<00:03:46.299> pressed<00:03:46.570> it<00:03:46.720> up<00:03:46.810> against

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
it in there and pressed it up against

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.229 
it in there and pressed it up against
the<00:03:47.320> underside<00:03:47.769> of<00:03:47.799> this<00:03:47.980> piece<00:03:48.250> and<00:03:48.610> then<00:03:49.120> you

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
the underside of this piece and then you

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.340 
the underside of this piece and then you
have<00:03:49.420> something<00:03:49.840> to<00:03:50.320> actually<00:03:51.280> put<00:03:51.549> the<00:03:52.350> roof

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
have something to actually put the roof

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.780 
have something to actually put the roof
piece<00:03:53.680> on<00:03:54.010> when<00:03:54.430> you<00:03:54.549> go<00:03:55.390> to<00:03:55.450> glue<00:03:55.750> it<00:03:55.870> together

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
piece on when you go to glue it together

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.160 
piece on when you go to glue it together
so<00:03:57.790> then<00:03:58.120> I<00:03:58.150> had<00:03:59.400> this<00:04:00.400> ledge<00:04:00.670> and<00:04:01.030> then<00:04:01.750> little

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
so then I had this ledge and then little

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.070 
so then I had this ledge and then little
plastic<00:04:02.650> art<00:04:02.830> piece<00:04:03.010> down<00:04:03.310> here<00:04:03.580> so<00:04:03.820> I<00:04:03.850> just

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
plastic art piece down here so I just

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.280 
plastic art piece down here so I just
glued<00:04:05.080> this<00:04:05.590> down<00:04:05.950> here<00:04:06.370> and<00:04:06.580> view<00:04:06.970> it<00:04:07.290> flush

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
glued this down here and view it flush

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.490 
glued this down here and view it flush
against<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:08.830> side<00:04:09.040> here<00:04:09.459> in<00:04:10.209> the<00:04:10.330> back<00:04:10.540> that

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
against the side here in the back that

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.340 
against the side here in the back that
gave<00:04:11.739> me<00:04:11.859> a<00:04:11.889> stable<00:04:12.370> platform<00:04:13.200> platform<00:04:14.200> that

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
gave me a stable platform platform that

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.819 
gave me a stable platform platform that
work<00:04:14.530> was<00:04:14.919> actually<00:04:15.239> quite<00:04:16.239> this<00:04:16.540> straight

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
work was actually quite this straight

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.869 
work was actually quite this straight
following<00:04:18.489> the<00:04:18.609> lines<00:04:18.789> of<00:04:19.060> the<00:04:19.209> the<00:04:19.660> hull<00:04:19.870> turn

00:04:20.869 --> 00:04:20.879 
following the lines of the the hull turn

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:25.309 
following the lines of the the hull turn
so<00:04:21.879> then<00:04:22.030> I<00:04:22.060> just<00:04:22.300> cut<00:04:22.539> out<00:04:22.569> the<00:04:22.690> side<00:04:23.080> pieces

00:04:25.309 --> 00:04:25.319 
so then I just cut out the side pieces

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:28.290 
so then I just cut out the side pieces
other<00:04:26.319> angle<00:04:26.740> angled<00:04:27.370> one<00:04:27.580> have<00:04:27.940> a<00:04:27.970> straight

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
other angle angled one have a straight

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.330 
other angle angled one have a straight
one<00:04:28.539> and<00:04:29.050> the<00:04:29.259> same<00:04:29.560> thing<00:04:29.800> on<00:04:29.979> the<00:04:30.099> other<00:04:30.129> side

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
one and the same thing on the other side

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.740 
one and the same thing on the other side
as<00:04:31.060> you<00:04:31.240> can<00:04:31.360> see<00:04:33.120> one<00:04:34.120> thing<00:04:34.360> to<00:04:34.509> remember

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
as you can see one thing to remember

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.779 
as you can see one thing to remember
when<00:04:35.110> you<00:04:35.289> actually<00:04:36.810> these<00:04:37.810> pieces<00:04:38.400> are<00:04:39.400> just

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:39.789 
when you actually these pieces are just

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:42.330 
when you actually these pieces are just
flat<00:04:40.330> so<00:04:40.659> you<00:04:40.830> actually<00:04:41.830> glue<00:04:41.979> them<00:04:42.190> together

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
flat so you actually glue them together

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.700 
flat so you actually glue them together
like<00:04:42.729> that<00:04:42.780> but<00:04:43.780> when<00:04:43.960> we<00:04:43.990> come<00:04:44.229> to<00:04:44.470> these

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
like that but when we come to these

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.659 
like that but when we come to these
other<00:04:45.610> pieces<00:04:46.080> and<00:04:47.080> have<00:04:47.800> to<00:04:48.009> glue<00:04:48.520> them

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
other pieces and have to glue them

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:50.610 
other pieces and have to glue them
together<00:04:48.819> it's<00:04:49.300> a<00:04:49.449> very<00:04:49.780> good<00:04:49.990> idea<00:04:50.349> to

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
together it's a very good idea to

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.110 
together it's a very good idea to
actually<00:04:51.159> angled<00:04:52.030> inside<00:04:53.520> I'll<00:04:54.520> try<00:04:54.789> to<00:04:54.849> show

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
actually angled inside I'll try to show

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.089 
actually angled inside I'll try to show
you<00:04:55.180> here<00:04:56.159> yes<00:04:57.159> you<00:04:57.310> can<00:04:57.490> see<00:04:57.639> there<00:04:57.849> I

00:04:59.089 --> 00:04:59.099 
you here yes you can see there I

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:05.460 
you here yes you can see there I
actually<00:05:00.099> used<00:05:00.580> my<00:05:01.800> exacto<00:05:02.800> knife<00:05:02.979> to<00:05:04.259> cut<00:05:05.259> an

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
actually used my exacto knife to cut an

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.459 
actually used my exacto knife to cut an
angle<00:05:05.680> into<00:05:06.310> the<00:05:06.340> edge<00:05:06.880> of<00:05:07.659> the<00:05:07.990> plastic<00:05:08.440> card

00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:10.469 
angle into the edge of the plastic card

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:16.409 
angle into the edge of the plastic card
this<00:05:11.469> is<00:05:12.240> cut<00:05:13.240> over<00:05:13.509> this<00:05:13.810> piece<00:05:14.800> here<00:05:15.069> so<00:05:15.419> so

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:16.419 
this is cut over this piece here so so

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:19.020 
this is cut over this piece here so so
on<00:05:16.629> both<00:05:16.840> sides<00:05:17.319> main<00:05:17.830> angle<00:05:18.370> cuts<00:05:18.610> when<00:05:18.909> you

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
on both sides main angle cuts when you

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.129 
on both sides main angle cuts when you
put<00:05:19.210> them<00:05:19.419> together<00:05:19.539> they<00:05:19.870> can<00:05:20.199> actually

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:22.139 
put them together they can actually

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:29.670 
put them together they can actually
connect<00:05:23.139> together<00:05:24.479> in<00:05:25.479> a<00:05:25.569> good<00:05:25.750> way<00:05:26.699> like<00:05:28.680> that

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
connect together in a good way like that

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.269 
connect together in a good way like that
if<00:05:30.340> you<00:05:30.490> had<00:05:30.580> two<00:05:30.759> angular<00:05:31.090> piece<00:05:31.449> pieces<00:05:32.279> so

00:05:33.269 --> 00:05:33.279 
if you had two angular piece pieces so

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:35.510 
if you had two angular piece pieces so
that's<00:05:33.460> a<00:05:33.550> good<00:05:33.699> tip<00:05:33.880> to<00:05:34.150> make<00:05:34.659> create<00:05:35.199> a

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
that's a good tip to make create a

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.269 
that's a good tip to make create a
greater<00:05:36.520> surface<00:05:36.940> area<00:05:37.860> for<00:05:38.860> the<00:05:38.889> glue<00:05:39.099> to

00:05:39.269 --> 00:05:39.279 
greater surface area for the glue to

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:43.409 
greater surface area for the glue to
stick<00:05:39.340> on<00:05:41.039> not<00:05:42.039> a<00:05:42.069> great<00:05:42.460> little<00:05:42.909> tip<00:05:43.210> when

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
stick on not a great little tip when

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:45.029 
stick on not a great little tip when
you're<00:05:43.569> building<00:05:43.930> this<00:05:44.080> is<00:05:44.289> to<00:05:44.469> remember<00:05:44.740> to

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 
you're building this is to remember to

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:47.129 
you're building this is to remember to
put<00:05:45.279> in<00:05:45.460> the<00:05:45.699> the<00:05:46.060> inserts<00:05:46.539> in<00:05:46.779> all<00:05:46.930> these

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:47.139 
put in the the inserts in all these

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:49.290 
put in the the inserts in all these
there's<00:05:47.650> an<00:05:47.979> insert<00:05:48.340> for<00:05:48.370> this<00:05:48.699> aerials

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
there's an insert for this aerials

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.290 
there's an insert for this aerials
thingy<00:05:50.199> and<00:05:50.560> insert<00:05:50.919> for<00:05:51.130> this<00:05:51.250> intake<00:05:51.849> and

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
thingy and insert for this intake and

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:58.939 
thingy and insert for this intake and
actually<00:05:53.110> this<00:05:53.259> side<00:05:54.659> intake<00:05:55.659> as<00:05:55.840> well<00:05:56.669> I

00:05:58.939 --> 00:05:58.949 
actually this side intake as well I

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:01.769 
actually this side intake as well I
almost<00:05:59.949> forgot<00:06:00.460> to<00:06:00.610> put<00:06:00.819> this<00:06:01.180> one<00:06:01.419> in<00:06:01.599> before

00:06:01.769 --> 00:06:01.779 
almost forgot to put this one in before

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:04.510 
almost forgot to put this one in before
I<00:06:01.990> glue<00:06:02.169> the<00:06:02.409> two<00:06:02.680> pieces<00:06:02.710> together

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 
I glue the two pieces together

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.390 
I glue the two pieces together
and<00:06:04.669> access<00:06:05.569> to<00:06:05.750> this<00:06:05.870> that<00:06:06.199> they're<00:06:06.500> in<00:06:07.250> an

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
and access to this that they're in an

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.689 
and access to this that they're in an
easy<00:06:07.669> way<00:06:07.940> so<00:06:07.970> we<00:06:08.720> remember<00:06:08.900> to<00:06:09.639> check<00:06:10.639> the

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:10.699 
easy way so we remember to check the

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:16.749 
easy way so we remember to check the
building<00:06:14.650> instructions<00:06:15.650> from<00:06:15.979> the<00:06:16.129> kids<00:06:16.340> so

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:16.759 
building instructions from the kids so

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:19.689 
building instructions from the kids so
you<00:06:16.819> don't<00:06:17.120> forget<00:06:17.479> to<00:06:17.659> put<00:06:17.960> in<00:06:18.400> those<00:06:19.400> little

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:19.699 
you don't forget to put in those little

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:26.950 
you don't forget to put in those little
pieces<00:06:20.530> so<00:06:21.530> that<00:06:22.300> so<00:06:25.539> that's<00:06:26.539> where<00:06:26.780> we<00:06:26.930> are

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 
pieces so that so that's where we are

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.460 
pieces so that so that's where we are
right<00:06:27.289> now<00:06:28.270> after<00:06:29.270> doing<00:06:29.629> all<00:06:29.840> this

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:30.470 
right now after doing all this

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.230 
right now after doing all this
challah<00:06:30.770> pieces<00:06:31.159> together<00:06:31.340> I<00:06:31.819> actually

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240 
challah pieces together I actually

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.010 
challah pieces together I actually
painted<00:06:32.840> up<00:06:33.110> the<00:06:33.259> cockpit<00:06:33.909> put<00:06:34.909> in<00:06:35.060> the<00:06:35.300> little

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:36.020 
painted up the cockpit put in the little

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.610 
painted up the cockpit put in the little
guy<00:06:36.199> here<00:06:36.470> you<00:06:36.729> actually<00:06:37.729> put<00:06:37.909> up<00:06:38.090> the<00:06:38.620> lower

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:39.620 
guy here you actually put up the lower

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.589 
guy here you actually put up the lower
part<00:06:39.979> of<00:06:40.159> the<00:06:40.280> cockpit<00:06:40.520> you<00:06:40.819> put<00:06:41.060> in<00:06:41.180> from<00:06:41.479> the

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:41.599 
part of the cockpit you put in from the

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:45.129 
part of the cockpit you put in from the
other<00:06:41.810> side<00:06:42.199> if<00:06:42.949> this<00:06:43.340> is<00:06:43.520> a<00:06:43.550> back<00:06:44.150> panel<00:06:44.479> glued

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:45.139 
other side if this is a back panel glued

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:47.409 
other side if this is a back panel glued
to<00:06:45.259> it<00:06:45.380> as<00:06:45.560> well<00:06:45.800> putting<00:06:46.789> in<00:06:47.030> from<00:06:47.300> the

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:47.419 
to it as well putting in from the

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:50.890 
to it as well putting in from the
underside<00:06:48.110> and<00:06:48.789> with<00:06:49.789> a<00:06:49.819> guy<00:06:50.090> in<00:06:50.300> it<00:06:50.479> and<00:06:50.720> then

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:50.900 
underside and with a guy in it and then

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.899 
underside and with a guy in it and then
this<00:06:51.199> piece<00:06:51.500> actually<00:06:51.830> slots<00:06:52.400> in<00:06:52.580> from<00:06:52.789> the

00:06:52.899 --> 00:06:52.909 
this piece actually slots in from the

00:06:52.909 --> 00:07:00.029 
this piece actually slots in from the
top<00:06:53.090> side<00:06:53.360> so<00:06:54.020> you<00:06:54.110> can't<00:06:54.380> glue<00:06:54.800> this<00:06:55.009> to<00:06:55.969> that

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:00.039 

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:01.570 

so<00:07:01.039> there<00:07:01.250> we<00:07:01.400> are

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:01.580 
so there we are

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.640 
so there we are
unless<00:07:02.090> you<00:07:02.210> can<00:07:02.389> see<00:07:02.539> I<00:07:02.569> converted<00:07:03.560> the

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:03.650 
unless you can see I converted the

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:05.529 
unless you can see I converted the
pallet<00:07:03.919> a<00:07:04.009> little<00:07:04.250> bit<00:07:04.340> because<00:07:04.759> this<00:07:05.090> will<00:07:05.389> be

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:05.539 
pallet a little bit because this will be

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:08.620 
pallet a little bit because this will be
used<00:07:05.719> by<00:07:05.810> my<00:07:06.169> pre<00:07:06.710> heresy<00:07:07.129> liberals<00:07:07.580> so<00:07:08.360> I<00:07:08.389> put

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:08.630 
used by my pre heresy liberals so I put

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:14.379 
used by my pre heresy liberals so I put
an<00:07:08.750> M<00:07:08.990> key<00:07:09.199> to<00:07:09.440> a<00:07:09.469> breast<00:07:09.889> title<00:07:10.430> on<00:07:10.639> him<00:07:10.940> I<00:07:13.389> have

00:07:14.379 --> 00:07:14.389 
an M key to a breast title on him I have

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:19.649 
an M key to a breast title on him I have
a<00:07:14.419> different<00:07:15.110> head<00:07:15.319> for<00:07:15.590> him<00:07:15.680> as<00:07:15.800> well<00:07:15.979> to<00:07:16.580> use

00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:19.659 

00:07:19.659 --> 00:07:24.040 

so<00:07:20.659> that's<00:07:20.930> where<00:07:21.229> we're<00:07:21.380> at<00:07:21.469> right<00:07:21.889> now<00:07:23.050> the

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:24.050 
so that's where we're at right now the

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.110 
so that's where we're at right now the
reason<00:07:24.229> I<00:07:24.469> put<00:07:24.710> in<00:07:24.860> the<00:07:25.009> cockpit<00:07:25.520> is<00:07:25.789> to<00:07:26.029> be

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:26.120 
reason I put in the cockpit is to be

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.379 
reason I put in the cockpit is to be
able<00:07:26.270> to<00:07:26.620> actually<00:07:27.620> fit<00:07:28.250> the<00:07:28.610> underside<00:07:29.180> on

00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:29.389 
able to actually fit the underside on

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:31.749 
able to actually fit the underside on
and<00:07:29.690> decide<00:07:30.110> how<00:07:30.380> to<00:07:30.440> attach<00:07:31.130> the<00:07:31.370> wing<00:07:31.520> and

00:07:31.749 --> 00:07:31.759 
and decide how to attach the wing and

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:34.870 
and decide how to attach the wing and
build<00:07:31.969> build<00:07:32.509> this<00:07:33.169> whole<00:07:33.409> part<00:07:33.770> because<00:07:34.729> the

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:34.880 
build build this whole part because the

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.159 
build build this whole part because the
next<00:07:35.090> step<00:07:35.270> we're<00:07:35.419> going<00:07:35.539> to<00:07:35.599> do<00:07:35.750> is<00:07:35.960> to

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:36.169 
next step we're going to do is to

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:43.170 
next step we're going to do is to
actually<00:07:36.349> box<00:07:36.830> in<00:07:37.069> this<00:07:37.779> whole<00:07:38.779> area<00:07:39.080> and

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:43.180 

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.730 

decide<00:07:44.180> how<00:07:44.479> to<00:07:44.539> do<00:07:44.810> the<00:07:44.990> wing<00:07:45.199> mount<00:07:45.469> as<00:07:45.710> well

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:45.740 
decide how to do the wing mount as well

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.610 
decide how to do the wing mount as well
so<00:07:46.699> I<00:07:46.729> will<00:07:47.090> be<00:07:47.210> back<00:07:47.389> with<00:07:47.630> the<00:07:47.840> that<00:07:48.169> update

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:48.620 
so I will be back with the that update
