 in the winter 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.010

 but 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.200
 this 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.150
 I more 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.569
 winter 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.569
 Yes 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.390
 a duet that just arose on ours 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.840
 eyes of the project main stage 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.840
 thanks to Igor I. look at 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.420
 fan club there oleg you better 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.730
 people came with posters and so the first one 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:34.950
 Us this is a setup. You wrote these. 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:36.990
 I see the posters I did this I wrote my 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.070

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.240
 so they are neighbors 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:45.239
 there was such a Victor Drobysh 2 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.400
 amazingly talented person but 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:52.190
 the first one I certainly would not have united their duet 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:55.470
 I think this is a bad second tradeoff 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:58.709
 like and the song is good and sang well yes 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:01.920

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.970
 I just do not like and could 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.070
 more to do and probably one by one 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.720
 You amazingly talented people probably 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.780

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.139

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:42.169

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:45.439

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.210
 if you find yourself in the final you are worthy 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:54.919
 Immediately after the final run and generally 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:58.099
 pursue your career and achieve 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:05:00.319
 much in very talented but is it possible 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:03.439
 little people should know what 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:05.360
 songwriter in general from yes 

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:08.180
 how much does it integrate what do we 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.669
 it seemed a little female morning 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:18.110
 have his awesome guys in and sing arly 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:20.330
 and Oleg is 30 times sorry I'm so 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.110
 i'll say but it just hurts me to listen 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.199
 without shine 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.750
 that is, a little virgin song composed 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:30.050
 Oleg you mean you adore group 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.879
 chic but this song is on and it was not necessary 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.889
 why do you just explain we are not 

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:36.349
 I understand it went out to my delight everyone all 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:38.629
 arranging here again jam gave it just 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:43.699
 you were learning songs yesterday maybe this is not 

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:45.409
 this is not natural so well and the bird 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:48.919
 the creature plays for years and 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:51.050
 and tries 5 folk artist on such 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:54.860
 it was simply one lyrics repressor 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:57.219
 learned and played poorly and sawed wrong 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:00.050
 even had time not very right 

00:05:57.219 --> 00:06:01.129
 let's be honest honestly and this to me 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:05.919
 really did not like 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:08.750
 guys I really liked it era 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:09.800
 pasting was from the heart it was up 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.589
 energetically 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.569
 thank you so much 

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:15.610
 liked 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:19.569
 thank you genre please and 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:22.270
 Grigorievich get out of this duet I 

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:24.819
 collected and gives only to these 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:27.399
 talented people as far as possible 

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:29.439
 left could fight for 

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:32.499
 for a place under the sun is absolutely correct 

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:34.929
 yes not exactly why they absolutely 

00:06:32.499 --> 00:06:36.909
 different polar they are completely me even 

00:06:34.929 --> 00:06:39.129
 head and now the voices do not drink 

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:41.949
 so of course it's artificial 

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:45.419
 created duet as for song 

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:49.930
 I absolutely agree with all members of the jury 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:51.849
 it's such a little bit turned out so 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:54.879
 restaurant is so polluted 

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:59.610
 Well, we started about what we will rob the soul 

00:06:54.879 --> 00:07:02.649
 it didn’t work well why many guys 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:04.149
 guys are different but 125 is your mind if 

00:07:02.649 --> 00:07:06.519
 see new year lights on 

00:07:04.149 --> 00:07:10.899
 central channels here are just such 

00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:13.629
 songs with such rhythms to puss out from 70 

00:07:10.899 --> 00:07:16.389
 Now not on task as on tasks 

00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:17.680
 it is our task to make people i can't 

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:22.320
 let me play 

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:25.590
 your own business but the poet is now 

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:28.200
 defended the song though of course there are many 

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:31.230
 her question is generally well done because 

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:34.460
 played and if you're some kind of sex life and 

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:35.930
 and disassembly and everything is very important thanks 

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:39.030
 Grisha 

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:40.440
 let's spend applause seeing off 

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:46.550

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:46.550
 then from logvinenko and musicians to
