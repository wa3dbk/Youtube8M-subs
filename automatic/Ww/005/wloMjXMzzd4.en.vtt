Europe is not working in Europe and I'll
battle<00:01:31.770> him<00:01:31.860> on<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.250> day<00:01:32.520> in<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.759> day<00:01:32.790> out

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
battle him on that day in and day out

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.090 
battle him on that day in and day out
but<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.509> probably<00:01:34.200> not<00:01:34.439> going<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.590> be<00:01:34.680> calling

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
but I probably not going to be calling

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.069 
but I probably not going to be calling
him<00:01:35.189> names<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:35.700> much<00:01:35.909> as<00:01:36.119> calling<00:01:36.900> him<00:01:36.990> a

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
him names so much as calling him a

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.170 
him names so much as calling him a
failure<00:01:37.409> what<00:01:37.860> happens<00:01:38.189> if<00:01:38.310> he<00:01:38.400> wins<00:01:38.610> again<00:01:38.939> I

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
failure what happens if he wins again I

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.660 
failure what happens if he wins again I
think<00:01:39.509> we<00:01:39.630> hit<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.810> greased<00:01:40.110> like<00:01:40.380> wall<00:01:40.670> so

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
think we hit a greased like wall so

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.920 
think we hit a greased like wall so
we're<00:01:41.790> going<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.970> be<00:01:42.030> greased<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.540> think<00:01:42.810> I

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
we're going to be greased I think I

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.630 
we're going to be greased I think I
think<00:01:43.110> before<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.500> end<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.770> his<00:01:43.979> second<00:01:44.610> term

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
think before the end of his second term

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.580 
think before the end of his second term
if<00:01:44.880> he<00:01:45.000> were<00:01:45.090> reelected<00:01:45.479> there's<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.229> very<00:01:46.500> high

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
if he were reelected there's a very high

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.740 
if he were reelected there's a very high
risk<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.159> we<00:01:47.310> would<00:01:47.490> hit<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.880> financial

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
risk that we would hit a a financial

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.690 
risk that we would hit a a financial
crisis<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.290> Greece<00:01:49.560> or<00:01:49.770> Italy<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.130> face<00:01:50.430> I

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
crisis the Greece or Italy a face I

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.060 
crisis the Greece or Italy a face I
think<00:01:51.210> it's<00:01:51.570> also<00:01:51.750> very<00:01:52.290> possible<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.860> we

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
think it's also very possible that we

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.710 
think it's also very possible that we
would<00:01:53.220> continue<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.729> see<00:01:53.909> very<00:01:54.180> high<00:01:54.360> levels

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
would continue to see very high levels

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.709 
would continue to see very high levels
of<00:01:54.840> unemployment<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.680> think<00:01:56.219> you'd<00:01:56.340> see<00:01:56.579> a

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
of unemployment I think you'd see a

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:58.940 
of unemployment I think you'd see a

of change that we hope to realize not

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.560 
of change that we hope to realize not
when<00:03:10.130> you<00:03:10.220> hear<00:03:10.400> Ron<00:03:10.640> Paul<00:03:11.000> said<00:03:11.330> that<00:03:11.480> the

when you hear Ron Paul said that the

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.810 
when you hear Ron Paul said that the
United<00:03:11.900> States<00:03:11.960> screwed<00:03:12.500> up<00:03:12.680> everything<00:03:13.460> and

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
United States screwed up everything and

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.750 
United States screwed up everything and
we're<00:03:14.230> it's<00:03:15.230> our<00:03:15.410> fault<00:03:15.710> but<00:03:15.920> the<00:03:16.070> Muslim

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
we're it's our fault but the Muslim

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.850 
we're it's our fault but the Muslim
jihadists<00:03:16.880> are<00:03:17.450> attacking<00:03:18.110> us<00:03:18.440> and<00:03:18.650> that<00:03:18.800> we

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
jihadists are attacking us and that we

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.010 
jihadists are attacking us and that we
should<00:03:19.010> be<00:03:19.070> friendly<00:03:19.490> to<00:03:19.520> Iran<00:03:20.060> and<00:03:20.510> they

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
should be friendly to Iran and they

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.720 
should be friendly to Iran and they
don't<00:03:21.140> really<00:03:21.410> have<00:03:21.680> a<00:03:21.710> nuclear<00:03:22.160> weapon<00:03:22.580> when

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
don't really have a nuclear weapon when

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.700 
don't really have a nuclear weapon when
you<00:03:22.820> hear<00:03:23.030> a<00:03:23.060> guy<00:03:23.300> like<00:03:23.540> that<00:03:23.570> may<00:03:24.110> win<00:03:24.350> Iowa

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:24.710 
you hear a guy like that may win Iowa

you hear a guy like that may win Iowa
what<00:03:25.100> goes<00:03:25.250> through<00:03:25.460> your<00:03:25.490> mind<00:03:25.610> well<00:03:26.570> he's

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
what goes through your mind well he's

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.420 
what goes through your mind well he's
badly<00:03:27.170> mistaken<00:03:27.470> I<00:03:27.920> think<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.310> evidence

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
badly mistaken I think the evidence

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.730 
badly mistaken I think the evidence
points<00:03:28.970> quite<00:03:29.360> clear<00:03:29.600> to<00:03:29.630> the<00:03:29.840> fact<00:03:30.080> that<00:03:30.200> that

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
points quite clear to the fact that that

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.670 
points quite clear to the fact that that
jihadism<00:03:31.280> is<00:03:32.090> not<00:03:32.480> something<00:03:32.720> we<00:03:32.990> caused<00:03:33.230> we

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
jihadism is not something we caused we

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.960 
jihadism is not something we caused we
have<00:03:33.800> to<00:03:33.920> recognize<00:03:34.310> that<00:03:34.340> we<00:03:34.640> are<00:03:34.670> in

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
have to recognize that we are in

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.690 
have to recognize that we are in
conflict<00:03:35.300> with<00:03:35.660> jihadism<00:03:36.170> and<00:03:36.650> and<00:03:37.550> that

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
conflict with jihadism and and that

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.580 
conflict with jihadism and and that
ultimately<00:03:37.820> the<00:03:38.300> idea<00:03:38.630> of<00:03:38.840> Iran<00:03:39.140> having<00:03:39.410> a

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
ultimately the idea of Iran having a

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.500 
ultimately the idea of Iran having a
nuclear<00:03:39.620> weapon<00:03:40.250> would<00:03:40.940> suggest<00:03:41.180> that

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
nuclear weapon would suggest that

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.210 
nuclear weapon would suggest that
fissile<00:03:41.990> material<00:03:42.440> may<00:03:42.620> find<00:03:42.890> its<00:03:43.040> way

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
fissile material may find its way

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.920 
fissile material may find its way
probably<00:03:43.490> will<00:03:43.850> find<00:03:44.090> its<00:03:44.240> way<00:03:44.270> at<00:03:44.480> some<00:03:44.690> point

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
probably will find its way at some point

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.110 
probably will find its way at some point
into<00:03:45.470> the<00:03:45.500> hands<00:03:45.890> of<00:03:45.980> Hezbollah<00:03:46.490> Hamas<00:03:46.700> or

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120

some other agent of theirs and and the

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.190 
some other agent of theirs and and the

world will have nuclear terror this is

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.810 
world will have nuclear terror this is
unacceptable<00:03:51.590> as<00:03:51.950> well<00:03:52.490> you're<00:03:52.670> going<00:03:52.760> to

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
unacceptable as well you're going to

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.280 
unacceptable as well you're going to
have<00:03:52.880> to<00:03:53.090> acknowledge<00:03:53.209> a<00:03:53.540> reaction<00:03:53.959> to<00:03:53.990> stop

have to acknowledge a reaction to stop

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.840 
have to acknowledge a reaction to stop
it<00:03:54.470> because<00:03:54.590> China<00:03:55.130> and<00:03:55.340> Russia<00:03:55.430> and

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
it because China and Russia and

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.510 
it because China and Russia and

force<00:03:58.820> them<00:03:59.060> stop<00:03:59.390> it<00:03:59.570> probably<00:03:59.870> one<00:04:00.020> of<00:04:00.050> the

force them stop it probably one of the

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.110 
force them stop it probably one of the
greatest<00:04:00.230> failures<00:04:00.950> of<00:04:01.100> this<00:04:01.610> president's

administration a failure of leadership

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.130 
administration a failure of leadership
was<00:04:04.459> when<00:04:04.670> he<00:04:04.820> decided<00:04:05.180> to<00:04:05.330> give<00:04:05.570> Russia<00:04:05.810> their

he was going to do that get some
something<00:04:21.930> back<00:04:22.140> and<00:04:22.380> by<00:04:22.860> the<00:04:22.890> way<00:04:23.010> that<00:04:23.100> would

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
something back and by the way that would

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.890 
something back and by the way that would
have<00:04:23.460> left<00:04:23.640> China<00:04:23.970> out<00:04:24.150> there<00:04:24.420> is<00:04:24.570> the<00:04:24.690> last

have left China out there is the last
man<00:04:25.140> standing<00:04:25.590> my<00:04:25.950> guess<00:04:26.190> is<00:04:26.400> we<00:04:26.880> could<00:04:27.030> have

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150

pushed<00:04:27.360> China<00:04:27.780> heart<00:04:28.020> that<00:04:28.440> was<00:04:28.650> then<00:04:28.950> and

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
pushed China heart that was then and

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.830 
pushed China heart that was then and
this<00:04:29.310> is<00:04:29.400> now<00:04:29.580> and<00:04:30.210> they're<00:04:30.330> chugging<00:04:30.780> along

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
this is now and they're chugging along

and you see the pinheads in Congress
they<00:05:49.200> can't<00:05:49.410> even<00:05:49.500> get<00:05:49.710> together<00:05:49.830> to<00:05:50.130> cut<00:05:50.340> 1.2

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
they can't even get together to cut 1.2

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.240 
they can't even get together to cut 1.2
trillion<00:05:51.600> how<00:05:51.960> are<00:05:52.020> you<00:05:52.110> going<00:05:52.230> to<00:05:52.350> cut<00:05:52.530> this

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
trillion how are you going to cut this

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.150 
trillion how are you going to cut this
deck<00:05:53.550> down<00:05:53.760> yeah<00:05:54.120> yeah<00:05:54.840> three<00:05:55.380> three<00:05:55.770> basic

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 
deck down yeah yeah three three basic

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.490 
deck down yeah yeah three three basic
steps<00:05:56.190> one<00:05:56.760> eliminate<00:05:57.300> a<00:05:57.420> lot<00:05:57.690> of<00:05:57.750> programs<00:05:58.260> we

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
steps one eliminate a lot of programs we

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.710 
steps one eliminate a lot of programs we
don't<00:05:58.710> have<00:05:58.950> to<00:05:59.130> have<00:05:59.310> the<00:05:59.910> upon<00:06:00.360> what<00:06:00.570> woody

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
don't have to have the upon what woody

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.600 
don't have to have the upon what woody
well<00:06:01.140> Obamacare<00:06:01.710> is<00:06:01.770> easiest<00:06:02.130> but<00:06:02.310> then<00:06:02.490> there

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
well Obamacare is easiest but then there

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.460 
well Obamacare is easiest but then there
others<00:06:02.820> number<00:06:03.180> to<00:06:03.360> take<00:06:03.690> a<00:06:03.720> lot<00:06:03.960> of<00:06:03.990> programs

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 
others number to take a lot of programs

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.170 
others number to take a lot of programs
that<00:06:04.590> are<00:06:04.770> growing<00:06:04.950> at<00:06:05.190> an<00:06:05.280> uncontrolled<00:06:05.910> rate

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
that are growing at an uncontrolled rate

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.570 
that are growing at an uncontrolled rate
like<00:06:06.450> Medicaid<00:06:07.080> turn<00:06:07.770> it<00:06:07.890> back<00:06:08.040> to<00:06:08.190> the<00:06:08.310> states

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
like Medicaid turn it back to the states

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.220 
like Medicaid turn it back to the states
and<00:06:08.790> say<00:06:09.000> that's<00:06:09.150> going<00:06:09.420> to<00:06:09.480> grow<00:06:09.600> now<00:06:09.810> at<00:06:10.050> the

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:10.230 
and say that's going to grow now at the

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.410 
and say that's going to grow now at the
CPI<00:06:10.680> plus<00:06:10.740> one<00:06:11.370> percent<00:06:11.760> that<00:06:11.910> saves<00:06:12.330> a

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:12.420 
CPI plus one percent that saves a

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.180 
CPI plus one percent that saves a
hundred<00:06:12.810> billion<00:06:13.200> dollars<00:06:13.380> a<00:06:13.770> year<00:06:13.980> and

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.190 
hundred billion dollars a year and

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.430
