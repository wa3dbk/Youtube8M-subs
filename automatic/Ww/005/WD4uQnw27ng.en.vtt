00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
basically I went into I played a lot of

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.500 
basically I went into I played a lot of
games<00:00:25.560> with<00:00:25.769> him<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.010> then<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.160> realized<00:00:26.550> he<00:00:27.359> is

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
games with him and then I realized he is

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.330 
games with him and then I realized he is
absolutely<00:00:27.990> beast<00:00:28.560> he<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:28.890> could<00:00:29.099> say<00:00:29.310> that

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
absolutely beast he you could say that

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.820 
absolutely beast he you could say that
he<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.970> cheap<00:00:30.300> Ibrahimovic<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.320> mean

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
he is the cheap Ibrahimovic I mean

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.500 
he is the cheap Ibrahimovic I mean
especially<00:00:32.189> since<00:00:32.669> Ibrahimovic<00:00:33.210> has<00:00:33.329> been

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
especially since Ibrahimovic has been

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.880 
especially since Ibrahimovic has been
dropped<00:00:33.719> down<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:34.079> four<00:00:34.380> star<00:00:34.620> skills

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
dropped down to four star skills

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.530 
dropped down to four star skills
although<00:00:35.100> Lukaku<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:35.910> think<00:00:36.120> three<00:00:36.360> star

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
although Lukaku is I think three star

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.530 
although Lukaku is I think three star
skills<00:00:36.809> still<00:00:37.649> now<00:00:38.430> when<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.820> use<00:00:38.940> Lukaku

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
skills still now when you use Lukaku

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.970 
skills still now when you use Lukaku

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
up in the air and then he jumped and

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.410 
up in the air and then he jumped and
headed<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.039> so<00:00:53.670> we're<00:00:53.850> winning<00:00:54.059> two<00:00:54.210> nil

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.479 
now so basically what what you get with
mathematica<00:00:57.750> was<00:00:57.989> basically<00:00:58.770> the

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
mathematica was basically the

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.310 
mathematica was basically the
normal<00:00:59.850> lucoc<00:01:00.149> was<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.359> very<00:01:00.600> powerful<00:01:00.780> striker

started youtube and it's gone through
phases<00:01:33.960> but<00:01:34.350> i<00:01:34.530> think<00:01:34.799> this<00:01:34.920> one<00:01:34.979> is<00:01:35.159> finally

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579

his<00:03:22.950> first<00:03:23.190> owner<00:03:23.430> I<00:03:23.700> think<00:03:24.120> it<00:03:24.180> would<00:03:24.270> be

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
his first owner I think it would be

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.550 
his first owner I think it would be
really<00:03:24.450> cool<00:03:24.690> to<00:03:24.750> keep<00:03:25.020> an<00:03:25.170> eye<00:03:25.260> look<00:03:25.410> at<00:03:25.500> this

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
really cool to keep an eye look at this

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.930 
really cool to keep an eye look at this
little<00:03:25.800> finish<00:03:26.070> okay<00:03:26.280> look<00:03:26.430> at<00:03:26.550> this<00:03:26.640> is<00:03:26.790> what

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
little finish okay look at this is what

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.360 
little finish okay look at this is what
I<00:03:26.970> mean<00:03:27.150> by<00:03:27.270> a<00:03:27.300> typical<00:03:27.720> striker<00:03:27.990> look<00:03:28.320> on<00:03:28.980> the

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
I mean by a typical striker look on the

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.490 
I mean by a typical striker look on the
turn<00:03:29.610> volley<00:03:29.940> I<00:03:30.240> mean<00:03:30.990> there<00:03:31.230> aren't<00:03:31.380> many

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
turn volley I mean there aren't many

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.050 
turn volley I mean there aren't many
strikers<00:03:32.010> I<00:03:32.100> can<00:03:32.280> put<00:03:32.490> those<00:03:32.610> away<00:03:32.820> that

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
strikers I can put those away that

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.090 
strikers I can put those away that
easily<00:03:33.270> now<00:03:33.630> I<00:03:33.840> think<00:03:34.260> he'll<00:03:34.380> be<00:03:34.530> stable<00:03:34.920> right

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
easily now I think he'll be stable right

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.480 
easily now I think he'll be stable right
now<00:03:35.130> he's<00:03:35.370> 220<00:03:36.090> k<00:03:36.510> 200<00:03:37.110> if<00:03:37.200> lucky<00:03:37.530> I<00:03:37.680> think<00:03:38.430> you

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
now he's 220 k 200 if lucky I think you

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.610 
now he's 220 k 200 if lucky I think you
can<00:03:38.670> get<00:03:38.850> him<00:03:38.970> he'll<00:03:39.270> be<00:03:39.390> stable<00:03:39.750> at<00:03:39.870> 150<00:03:40.410> very

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
can get him he'll be stable at 150 very

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.699 
can get him he'll be stable at 150 very
soon<00:03:40.920> maybe<00:03:41.160> even<00:03:41.400> 100<00:03:41.610> you<00:03:42.000> never<00:03:42.150> know<00:03:42.709> but

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
soon maybe even 100 you never know but

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.310 
soon maybe even 100 you never know but
I'm<00:03:43.920> just<00:03:44.130> thinking<00:03:44.430> to<00:03:44.550> myself<00:03:44.720> if<00:03:45.720> he<00:03:45.959> had<00:03:46.170> at

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
I'm just thinking to myself if he had at

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.680 
I'm just thinking to myself if he had at
least<00:03:46.470> an<00:03:46.770> average<00:03:47.160> of<00:03:47.280> 82<00:03:47.730> 83<00:03:48.030> dribbling<00:03:48.570> as

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
opposed to his 77 i think it is he would

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.520 
opposed to his 77 i think it is he would
just<00:03:50.730> be<00:03:50.850> godly<00:03:51.239> look<00:03:51.420> at<00:03:51.540> him<00:03:51.660> there<00:03:51.840> you<00:03:52.440> know
