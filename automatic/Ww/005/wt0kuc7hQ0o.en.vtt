00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:02.810 

in<00:00:01.439> this<00:00:01.650> tutorial<00:00:01.829> we'll<00:00:02.280> take<00:00:02.490> a<00:00:02.520> closer

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
in this tutorial we'll take a closer

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.300 
in this tutorial we'll take a closer
look<00:00:02.939> at<00:00:03.240> the<00:00:03.419> use<00:00:03.540> of<00:00:03.780> weight<00:00:04.319> painting<00:00:04.620> with

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
look at the use of weight painting with

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.160 
look at the use of weight painting with
particle<00:00:05.819> systems<00:00:06.180> and<00:00:06.420> vertex<00:00:06.779> groups

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
particle systems and vertex groups

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.020 
particle systems and vertex groups
it's<00:00:07.470> a<00:00:07.560> powerful<00:00:07.830> combination<00:00:08.130> and<00:00:08.730> it's<00:00:08.970> a

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
it's a powerful combination and it's a

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.910 
it's a powerful combination and it's a
lot<00:00:09.150> of<00:00:09.179> fun<00:00:09.420> and<00:00:09.630> since<00:00:10.290> we've<00:00:10.500> been<00:00:10.620> working

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
lot of fun and since we've been working

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.499 
lot of fun and since we've been working
with<00:00:10.950> vertex<00:00:11.400> groups<00:00:11.670> for<00:00:11.849> a<00:00:11.880> long<00:00:12.030> time<00:00:12.300> now

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
with vertex groups for a long time now

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.600 
with vertex groups for a long time now
this<00:00:13.080> will<00:00:13.259> be<00:00:13.349> really<00:00:13.590> straightforward<00:00:13.860> so<00:00:14.580> I

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
this will be really straightforward so I

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.980 
this will be really straightforward so I
just<00:00:14.820> have<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:14.969> plane<00:00:15.330> in<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.599> scene<00:00:15.780> right

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
just have a plane in the scene right

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.439 
just have a plane in the scene right
here<00:00:16.049> that<00:00:16.529> has<00:00:17.190> nothing<00:00:17.520> associated<00:00:18.180> with<00:00:18.300> it

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
here that has nothing associated with it

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.960 
here that has nothing associated with it
yet<00:00:18.840> so<00:00:19.529> but<00:00:19.710> we're<00:00:19.859> going<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.279> do<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:20.520> we'll<00:00:20.850> go

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
yet so but we're going to do is we'll go

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.420 
yet so but we're going to do is we'll go
into<00:00:21.119> edit<00:00:21.390> mode<00:00:21.420> but<00:00:22.140> tab<00:00:22.410> press<00:00:22.920> W<00:00:23.279> we're

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
into edit mode but tab press W we're

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.070 
into edit mode but tab press W we're
gonna<00:00:23.519> subdivide<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.150> quite<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.359> few<00:00:24.390> times<00:00:24.570> all

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
gonna subdivide it quite a few times all

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.580 
gonna subdivide it quite a few times all
right<00:00:25.140> I<00:00:25.410> just<00:00:25.710> keep<00:00:25.830> doing<00:00:26.010> that<00:00:27.529> you<00:00:28.529> know

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
right I just keep doing that you know

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.960 
right I just keep doing that you know
maybe<00:00:28.800> one<00:00:29.070> more<00:00:29.250> all<00:00:29.490> right<00:00:29.519> so<00:00:29.760> we<00:00:29.849> have

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
maybe one more all right so we have

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.700 
maybe one more all right so we have
quite<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.210> few<00:00:30.269> subdivisions<00:00:31.109> alright<00:00:31.650> I'm

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
quite a few subdivisions alright I'm

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.410 
quite a few subdivisions alright I'm
gonna<00:00:31.800> leave<00:00:32.009> edit<00:00:32.340> mode<00:00:32.520> now<00:00:32.969> let's<00:00:33.120> go<00:00:33.210> take

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
gonna leave edit mode now let's go take

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.760 
gonna leave edit mode now let's go take
a<00:00:33.450> look<00:00:33.690> at<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.870> object<00:00:34.230> data<00:00:34.320> button<00:00:34.620> the

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
a look at the object data button the

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.220 
a look at the object data button the
upside-down<00:00:35.070> triangle<00:00:35.910> here<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.329> we'll<00:00:37.140> go

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
upside-down triangle here and we'll go

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.720 
upside-down triangle here and we'll go
look<00:00:37.469> at<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.620> vertex<00:00:37.950> groups<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.460> there's<00:00:38.579> no

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
look at the vertex groups and there's no

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.790 
look at the vertex groups and there's no
vertex<00:00:39.090> groups<00:00:39.480> associated<00:00:39.989> with<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.379> yet

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
vertex groups associated with it yet

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.200 
vertex groups associated with it yet
all<00:00:41.129> right<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:41.670> we'll<00:00:41.790> leave<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:42.030> like<00:00:42.180> that

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
all right so we'll leave it like that

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.360 
all right so we'll leave it like that
just<00:00:42.390> for<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.750> moment<00:00:42.899> alright<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:44.280> we're

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
just for a moment alright and we're

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.979 
just for a moment alright and we're
gonna<00:00:44.460> go<00:00:44.610> get<00:00:44.760> give<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.180> particle<00:00:45.600> system

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
gonna go get give it a particle system

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.410 
gonna go get give it a particle system
I'll<00:00:46.739> give<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.070> particle<00:00:47.520> system<00:00:47.670> we'll

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
I'll give it a particle system we'll

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.450 
I'll give it a particle system we'll
give<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.750> little<00:00:48.780> bit<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.170> life<00:00:49.350> like<00:00:50.250> that

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
give it a little bit of life like that

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.920 
give it a little bit of life like that
and<00:00:50.610> there<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.789> can<00:00:50.910> see<00:00:51.149> it's<00:00:51.360> starting<00:00:51.840> to

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
and there you can see it's starting to

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.500 
and there you can see it's starting to
show<00:00:52.739> up<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.190> I'm<00:00:53.489> going<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.699> use<00:00:53.850> instead<00:00:54.360> of

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
show up and I'm going to use instead of

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.119 
show up and I'm going to use instead of
the<00:00:55.789> normal<00:00:56.989> as<00:00:57.989> far<00:00:58.320> as<00:00:58.440> admitting<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:58.920> like

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
the normal as far as admitting it like

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.709 
the normal as far as admitting it like
this<00:00:59.340> like<00:00:59.579> I've<00:00:59.730> done<00:00:59.910> in<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.149> past<00:01:00.180> like

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
this like I've done in the past like

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.240 
this like I've done in the past like
you'll<00:01:00.899> see<00:01:01.079> if<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.199> go<00:01:01.320> get<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.500> timeline<00:01:02.010> down

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
you'll see if I go get a timeline down

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.719 
you'll see if I go get a timeline down
here<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.940> press<00:01:03.510> all<00:01:03.930> day<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:05.250> can<00:01:05.369> see<00:01:05.549> they're

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
here I press all day you can see they're

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.190 
here I press all day you can see they're
kicking<00:01:06.119> out<00:01:06.240> like<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.659> but<00:01:06.869> instead<00:01:07.020> of

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
kicking out like that but instead of

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.100 
kicking out like that but instead of
that<00:01:07.470> I'll<00:01:08.010> set<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.580> zero<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.810> like<00:01:09.990> to

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
that I'll set that to zero and I like to

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.170 
that I'll set that to zero and I like to
work<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.409> know<00:01:10.560> in<00:01:10.740> local<00:01:11.220> mode<00:01:11.430> like<00:01:11.909> this

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
work you know in local mode like this

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.080 
work you know in local mode like this
now<00:01:12.869> my<00:01:13.020> axis<00:01:13.530> my<00:01:13.680> local<00:01:13.890> axis<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.490> pointing<00:01:14.970> in

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
now my axis my local axis is pointing in

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.399 
now my axis my local axis is pointing in
positive<00:01:15.600> z<00:01:15.750> direction

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
positive z direction

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.890 
positive z direction
so<00:01:16.710> I'll<00:01:16.830> set<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.130> value<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:17.729> positive<00:01:18.240> Z<00:01:18.299> like

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
so I'll set the value in positive Z like

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.480 
so I'll set the value in positive Z like
this<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:19.380> then<00:01:19.530> when<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.710> run<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.070> particle

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
this so then when I run the particle

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.630 
this so then when I run the particle
system<00:01:20.640> with<00:01:20.939> all<00:01:21.090> day<00:01:22.009> it<00:01:23.009> essentially<00:01:23.400> does

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
system with all day it essentially does

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.460 
system with all day it essentially does
the<00:01:23.790> same<00:01:24.000> thing<00:01:24.270> but<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.900> gives<00:01:25.020> me<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.259> little

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
the same thing but it gives me a little

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.590 
the same thing but it gives me a little
bit<00:01:25.619> better<00:01:25.740> control<00:01:26.189> over<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.700> what<00:01:27.479> it's

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
bit better control over to what it's

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.380 
bit better control over to what it's
doing<00:01:27.900> well<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:28.979> now<00:01:29.159> those<00:01:29.579> particles<00:01:30.180> are

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
doing well so now those particles are

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.440 
doing well so now those particles are
being<00:01:31.340> kicked<00:01:32.340> out<00:01:32.490> out<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:32.939> each<00:01:33.090> one<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.329> the

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
being kicked out out of each one of the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.300 
being kicked out out of each one of the
faces<00:01:33.869> like<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.110> I've<00:01:34.380> had<00:01:34.560> more<00:01:34.770> particles

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
faces like that I've had more particles

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.510 
faces like that I've had more particles
we'd<00:01:35.939> see<00:01:36.150> quite<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> few<00:01:36.659> more<00:01:37.430> from<00:01:38.430> each

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
we'd see quite a few more from each

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.740 
we'd see quite a few more from each
other<00:01:38.700> or<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.119> could<00:01:39.240> set<00:01:39.390> them<00:01:39.509> out<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.689> the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
other or you could set them out of the

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.260 
other or you could set them out of the
vertices<00:01:40.020> like<00:01:40.590> this<00:01:40.890> but<00:01:41.880> what<00:01:42.090> we're<00:01:42.240> going

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
vertices like this but what we're going

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.840 
vertices like this but what we're going
to<00:01:42.420> do<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.689> we're<00:01:42.840> going<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:42.990> control<00:01:43.850> what

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
to do is we're going to control what

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.480 
to do is we're going to control what
phases<00:01:45.720> or<00:01:45.869> vertices<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.590> particles<00:01:47.070> emanate

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
phases or vertices the particles emanate

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.149 
phases or vertices the particles emanate
from<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:48.060> we<00:01:48.659> will<00:01:48.750> do<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.020> through<00:01:49.950> the

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
from and we will do that through the

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.580 
from and we will do that through the
vertex<00:01:50.490> groups<00:01:50.820> then<00:01:51.299> normally<00:01:51.840> setting

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
vertex groups then normally setting

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.590 
vertex groups then normally setting
vertex<00:01:53.009> groups<00:01:53.310> one<00:01:53.820> things<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.149> do<00:01:54.299> is<00:01:54.450> we'll

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
vertex groups one things you do is we'll

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.410 
vertex groups one things you do is we'll
go<00:01:54.630> get<00:01:54.960> will<00:01:55.470> call<00:01:56.219> this<00:01:56.460> particle<00:01:57.119> group

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.179 

like<00:02:00.420> this<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.810> we<00:02:01.530> have<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.770> be<00:02:01.860> in<00:02:01.950> edit<00:02:02.159> mode

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
like this and we have to be in edit mode

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.920 
like this and we have to be in edit mode
to<00:02:02.490> change<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.210> you've<00:02:03.390> seen<00:02:03.600> what<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.750> use

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
to change it and you've seen what I use

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.899 
to change it and you've seen what I use
cloth<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.560> other<00:02:04.649> things<00:02:05.040> before<00:02:05.280> that<00:02:05.700> I<00:02:05.759> go

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
cloth and other things before that I go

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.039 
cloth and other things before that I go
in<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.240> change<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.659> value<00:02:06.750> numerically

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
in and I change the value numerically

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.669 
in and I change the value numerically
like<00:02:07.649> this<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:09.209> actually<00:02:10.080> for<00:02:10.319> me<00:02:10.440> for

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
like this so and actually for me for

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.990 
like this so and actually for me for
what<00:02:10.770> I<00:02:10.800> do<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.129> programmer<00:02:11.700> that's

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
what I do is a programmer that's

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.930 
what I do is a programmer that's
actually<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.450> ideal<00:02:12.810> way<00:02:13.080> for<00:02:13.379> me<00:02:13.500> to

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
actually the ideal way for me to

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.370 
actually the ideal way for me to
numerically<00:02:14.940> but<00:02:15.450> if<00:02:15.930> you're<00:02:16.080> just<00:02:16.230> doing

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
numerically but if you're just doing

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.680 
numerically but if you're just doing
design<00:02:16.920> work<00:02:17.000> sometimes<00:02:18.000> just<00:02:18.300> doing<00:02:18.540> it

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
design work sometimes just doing it

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.840 
design work sometimes just doing it
through<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.230> paintbrush<00:02:19.860> can<00:02:20.550> be<00:02:20.640> a<00:02:20.670> lot<00:02:20.820> more

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
through the paintbrush can be a lot more

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:21.320 
through the paintbrush can be a lot more
fun

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
fun

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.880 
fun
it<00:02:21.510> might<00:02:21.690> look<00:02:21.840> difficult<00:02:22.050> but<00:02:22.320> it's<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:22.680> easy

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
it might look difficult but it's so easy

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.350 
it might look difficult but it's so easy
that's<00:02:23.130> almost<00:02:23.580> ridiculous

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
that's almost ridiculous

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.120 
that's almost ridiculous
so<00:02:24.540> in<00:02:25.290> here<00:02:25.440> with<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.650> first<00:02:25.830> I'm<00:02:25.950> going<00:02:26.070> to

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
so in here with the first I'm going to

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.840 
so in here with the first I'm going to
do<00:02:26.220> is<00:02:26.310> I'm<00:02:26.400> going<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.550> just<00:02:26.760> set<00:02:26.940> a<00:02:27.150> value<00:02:27.510> 0<00:02:27.770> we

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
do is I'm going to just set a value 0 we

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:36.830 
do is I'm going to just set a value 0 we
can<00:02:29.850> turn<00:02:30.090> that<00:02:30.210> into<00:02:30.270> a<00:02:30.480> zero<00:02:30.780> I<00:02:30.840> will<00:02:35.840> okay

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
can turn that into a zero I will okay

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.200 
can turn that into a zero I will okay
and<00:02:36.960> I'm<00:02:37.050> gonna<00:02:37.170> sign<00:02:37.440> it<00:02:37.620> so<00:02:37.830> now<00:02:38.010> there's<00:02:38.210> no

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
and I'm gonna sign it so now there's no

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.000 
and I'm gonna sign it so now there's no
values<00:02:39.630> on<00:02:39.840> there<00:02:40.080> and<00:02:40.230> we'll<00:02:40.320> get<00:02:40.440> if<00:02:40.680> we<00:02:40.830> go

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
values on there and we'll get if we go

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.670 
values on there and we'll get if we go
into<00:02:41.280> weight<00:02:41.760> paint<00:02:42.060> mode<00:02:42.270> from<00:02:42.510> here<00:02:42.900> we<00:02:43.470> can

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
into weight paint mode from here we can

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.890 
into weight paint mode from here we can
see<00:02:43.860> it's<00:02:44.010> all<00:02:44.250> blue<00:02:45.120> so<00:02:45.450> there's<00:02:45.660> no<00:02:45.870> value

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
see it's all blue so there's no value

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.960 
see it's all blue so there's no value
set<00:02:46.560> with<00:02:46.740> that<00:02:46.920> whatsoever<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.850> we'll

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
set with that whatsoever and we'll

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.580 
set with that whatsoever and we'll
verify<00:02:48.209> that<00:02:48.630> but<00:02:48.870> if<00:02:48.930> we<00:02:49.050> just<00:02:49.080> go<00:02:49.410> into

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
verify that but if we just go into

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.080 
verify that but if we just go into
weight<00:02:50.430> paint<00:02:50.700> mode<00:02:50.910> and<00:02:51.150> assign<00:02:51.420> it<00:02:51.540> all<00:02:51.690> to

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
weight paint mode and assign it all to

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.030 
weight paint mode and assign it all to
one<00:02:54.090> then<00:02:54.840> if<00:02:55.050> we<00:02:55.140> go<00:02:55.260> to<00:02:55.290> weight<00:02:55.560> paint<00:02:55.830> and

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
one then if we go to weight paint and

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.610 
one then if we go to weight paint and
it's<00:02:56.340> all<00:02:56.489> red<00:02:56.730> so<00:02:57.030> that<00:02:57.180> means<00:02:57.420> we<00:02:58.230> use<00:02:58.260> that

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
it's all red so that means we use that

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.670 
it's all red so that means we use that
you<00:02:59.489> know<00:02:59.610> I<00:02:59.640> said<00:02:59.940> something<00:03:00.209> to<00:03:00.390> red<00:03:00.780> one<00:03:01.260> all

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
you know I said something to red one all

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.050 
you know I said something to red one all
along<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.010> top<00:03:02.220> edge<00:03:02.250> what<00:03:02.640> I<00:03:02.700> want<00:03:02.880> to<00:03:02.940> use

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
along the top edge what I want to use

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.949 
along the top edge what I want to use
cloth<00:03:03.360> at<00:03:03.570> times<00:03:04.550> all<00:03:05.550> right<00:03:05.640> so<00:03:06.150> that's

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
cloth at times all right so that's

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.850 
cloth at times all right so that's
important<00:03:07.700> but<00:03:08.700> let's<00:03:09.600> see<00:03:09.810> let's<00:03:10.200> go<00:03:10.680> back

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
important but let's see let's go back

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.570 
important but let's see let's go back
and<00:03:11.100> I'll<00:03:11.190> set<00:03:11.489> it<00:03:11.580> back<00:03:11.700> to<00:03:11.880> zero<00:03:12.150> and<00:03:13.580> then

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
and I'll set it back to zero and then

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.740 
and I'll set it back to zero and then
you'll<00:03:14.700> see<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:14.970> real<00:03:15.120> value<00:03:15.450> of<00:03:15.480> weight

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
you'll see the real value of weight

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.310 
you'll see the real value of weight
painting<00:03:16.170> here<00:03:16.440> so<00:03:17.100> now<00:03:17.280> if<00:03:17.970> at<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:18.900> value<00:03:19.230> of

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
painting here so now if at a value of

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.320 
painting here so now if at a value of
zero<00:03:20.000> if<00:03:21.000> I<00:03:21.120> run<00:03:21.360> the<00:03:21.510> particle<00:03:21.930> system<00:03:23.330> like

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
zero if I run the particle system like

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.590 
zero if I run the particle system like
this<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:26.280> particles<00:03:26.760> are<00:03:26.910> all<00:03:27.030> coming<00:03:27.330> out<00:03:27.480> of

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
this the particles are all coming out of

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.900 
this the particles are all coming out of
here<00:03:27.810> but<00:03:28.290> I<00:03:28.440> have<00:03:29.160> this<00:03:29.310> called<00:03:29.580> particle

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
here but I have this called particle

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.220 
here but I have this called particle
group<00:03:30.150> so<00:03:30.600> I'm<00:03:30.690> going<00:03:30.810> to<00:03:30.870> go<00:03:30.959> over<00:03:30.989> to<00:03:31.140> the

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
group so I'm going to go over to the

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.410 
group so I'm going to go over to the
particle<00:03:31.680> system<00:03:31.920> first<00:03:32.340> I'm<00:03:32.820> going<00:03:33.209> to<00:03:33.269> come

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
particle system first I'm going to come

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.009 
particle system first I'm going to come
down<00:03:33.570> here<00:03:33.930> to<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.500> vertex<00:03:34.980> groups<00:03:35.840> I'm<00:03:36.840> going

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
down here to the vertex groups I'm going

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.320 
down here to the vertex groups I'm going
to<00:03:37.110> put<00:03:37.320> go<00:03:37.709> to<00:03:37.769> this<00:03:37.980> density<00:03:38.400> field<00:03:38.730> click<00:03:39.209> in

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
to put go to this density field click in

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.570 
to put go to this density field click in
here<00:03:39.360> pick<00:03:39.989> the<00:03:40.110> particle<00:03:40.560> group<00:03:40.739> so<00:03:41.400> now

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
here pick the particle group so now

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.000 
here pick the particle group so now
basically<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.360> particle<00:03:42.690> systems<00:03:43.019> reliant

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
basically the particle systems reliant

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.420 
basically the particle systems reliant
on<00:03:44.100> the<00:03:45.030> vertex<00:03:45.450> group<00:03:45.720> that's<00:03:45.930> set<00:03:46.220> or<00:03:47.220> that

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
on the vertex group that's set or that

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.430 
on the vertex group that's set or that
particular<00:03:47.670> vertex<00:03:48.330> group<00:03:48.570> so<00:03:49.019> I'll<00:03:49.200> press

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
particular vertex group so I'll press

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.370 
particular vertex group so I'll press
all<00:03:49.680> day<00:03:49.709> now<00:03:50.160> and<00:03:50.840> nothing<00:03:51.840> happens<00:03:52.200> well

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
all day now and nothing happens well

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.590 
all day now and nothing happens well
this<00:03:52.530> one<00:03:52.830> little<00:03:53.220> event<00:03:53.610> happens<00:03:54.000> that<00:03:54.239> that

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
this one little event happens that that

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.210 
this one little event happens that that
that<00:03:54.810> happens<00:03:55.170> just<00:03:55.260> because<00:03:55.650> it's<00:03:55.830> telling

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
that happens just because it's telling

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.009 
that happens just because it's telling
you<00:03:56.340> there's<00:03:56.580> a<00:03:56.670> particle<00:03:57.060> system<00:03:57.180> associated

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
you there's a particle system associated

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.690 
you there's a particle system associated
with<00:03:58.230> it<00:03:58.380> all<00:03:58.560> right<00:03:58.620> that's<00:03:59.100> just<00:03:59.250> but<00:03:59.519> that's

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
with it all right that's just but that's

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.780 
with it all right that's just but that's
not<00:03:59.910> really<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.769> effect<00:04:01.769> of<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:02.190> painting

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
not really the effect of the painting

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.930 
not really the effect of the painting
itself<00:04:03.120> so<00:04:04.070> now<00:04:05.070> we'll<00:04:05.220> go<00:04:05.340> into<00:04:05.370> weight<00:04:05.670> paint

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
itself so now we'll go into weight paint

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.690 
itself so now we'll go into weight paint
mode<00:04:06.150> and<00:04:06.799> notice<00:04:07.799> everything<00:04:07.950> is<00:04:08.190> all<00:04:08.459> blue

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
mode and notice everything is all blue

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.150 
mode and notice everything is all blue
like<00:04:08.940> it<00:04:09.090> was<00:04:09.209> before<00:04:09.390> I'm<00:04:10.140> gonna<00:04:10.350> press<00:04:10.650> T<00:04:10.980> on

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
like it was before I'm gonna press T on

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.069 
like it was before I'm gonna press T on
the<00:04:11.250> keyboard<00:04:11.280> and<00:04:11.820> get<00:04:11.940> my<00:04:12.090> paintbrush<00:04:12.600> up

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
the keyboard and get my paintbrush up

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.319 
the keyboard and get my paintbrush up
that's<00:04:13.709> painting<00:04:14.130> currently<00:04:14.489> with<00:04:14.610> a<00:04:14.640> value

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
that's painting currently with a value

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:17.870 
that's painting currently with a value
of<00:04:15.450> 1<00:04:15.690> which<00:04:15.720> would<00:04:16.109> be<00:04:16.169> all<00:04:16.410> red<00:04:16.769> so<00:04:16.820> maybe<00:04:17.820> I

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
of 1 which would be all red so maybe I

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
of 1 which would be all red so maybe I
don't<00:04:17.940> want<00:04:18.120> to<00:04:18.180> paint<00:04:18.299> with<00:04:18.359> that<00:04:18.570> much<00:04:18.750> I'll

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
don't want to paint with that much I'll

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.270 
don't want to paint with that much I'll
just<00:04:19.019> paint<00:04:19.200> a<00:04:19.290> little<00:04:19.410> bit<00:04:19.560> that<00:04:19.829> won't<00:04:20.010> paint

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
just paint a little bit that won't paint

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.180 
just paint a little bit that won't paint
is<00:04:20.459> the<00:04:21.390> full<00:04:21.600> strength<00:04:21.989> and<00:04:22.890> I'll<00:04:22.979> cut<00:04:23.160> the

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
is the full strength and I'll cut the

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.010 
is the full strength and I'll cut the
radius<00:04:23.610> down<00:04:23.820> here<00:04:24.240> actually<00:04:24.750> can<00:04:24.840> cut<00:04:24.930> the

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
radius down here actually can cut the

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.200 
radius down here actually can cut the
radius<00:04:25.320> just<00:04:25.349> by<00:04:25.770> pressing<00:04:26.190> F

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
radius just by pressing F

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.870 
radius just by pressing F
it<00:04:27.419> like<00:04:27.900> that<00:04:28.110> some<00:04:29.100> make<00:04:29.250> a<00:04:29.280> smaller<00:04:29.639> radius

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
it like that some make a smaller radius

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.719 
it like that some make a smaller radius
like<00:04:30.300> about<00:04:30.600> this<00:04:31.430> here<00:04:32.430> okay<00:04:33.919> and<00:04:34.919> then<00:04:35.430> what

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
like about this here okay and then what

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:36.680 
like about this here okay and then what
I'm<00:04:35.819> gonna<00:04:35.910> do<00:04:36.090> I'm<00:04:36.210> going<00:04:36.360> to<00:04:36.419> start<00:04:36.599> the

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
I'm gonna do I'm going to start the

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.260 
I'm gonna do I'm going to start the
particle<00:04:37.080> set<00:04:37.259> them<00:04:37.410> up<00:04:37.560> all<00:04:38.130> day<00:04:38.430> all<00:04:39.150> right

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
particle set them up all day all right

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.850 
particle set them up all day all right
now<00:04:39.419> it's<00:04:39.599> running<00:04:39.840> and<00:04:40.080> now<00:04:40.590> I'm<00:04:40.710> going<00:04:40.800> to

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
now it's running and now I'm going to

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:47.749 
now it's running and now I'm going to
start<00:04:41.069> painting<00:04:41.280> alright<00:04:41.819> so<00:04:42.000> from<00:04:42.120> here<00:04:46.759> when

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 
start painting alright so from here when

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:51.219 
start painting alright so from here when
it<00:04:47.849> comes<00:04:48.000> back<00:04:48.210> around<00:04:48.389> you<00:04:48.990> will<00:04:49.139> understand

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:51.229 
it comes back around you will understand

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:53.059 
it comes back around you will understand
alright<00:04:52.229> we<00:04:52.349> need<00:04:52.470> a<00:04:52.530> little<00:04:52.680> more<00:04:52.860> weight

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:53.069 
alright we need a little more weight

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:55.219 
alright we need a little more weight
there<00:04:53.310> we<00:04:53.400> go<00:04:53.520> and<00:04:53.639> let<00:04:53.789> go<00:04:54.030> with<00:04:54.180> a<00:04:54.240> brush<00:04:54.479> and

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
there we go and let go with a brush and

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:57.350 
there we go and let go with a brush and
there<00:04:55.889> it<00:04:56.039> is<00:04:56.099> suddenly<00:04:56.759> I've<00:04:56.880> just<00:04:57.060> painted

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
there it is suddenly I've just painted

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.749 
there it is suddenly I've just painted
the<00:04:57.660> vertex<00:04:58.080> groups<00:04:58.410> on<00:04:58.650> and<00:04:58.919> it's<00:04:59.220> gonna<00:04:59.370> and

00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 
the vertex groups on and it's gonna and

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:01.490 
the vertex groups on and it's gonna and
the<00:05:00.180> particles<00:05:00.630> come<00:05:00.840> out<00:05:00.960> of<00:05:01.110> everywhere

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
the particles come out of everywhere

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.650 
the particles come out of everywhere
where<00:05:02.430> I've<00:05:02.520> been<00:05:02.669> painting<00:05:02.970> along<00:05:03.360> the<00:05:03.509> way

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
where I've been painting along the way

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.650 
where I've been painting along the way
so<00:05:04.259> ya<00:05:04.800> know<00:05:05.250> it's<00:05:05.490> a<00:05:05.550> it's<00:05:05.910> really<00:05:06.000> powerful

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
so ya know it's a it's really powerful

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.400 
so ya know it's a it's really powerful
way<00:05:06.780> to<00:05:06.810> work<00:05:07.110> and<00:05:08.360> the<00:05:09.360> better<00:05:09.630> you<00:05:10.050> know<00:05:10.199> the

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
way to work and the better you know the

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.040 
way to work and the better you know the
more<00:05:10.910> subdivided<00:05:11.910> your<00:05:12.060> mesh<00:05:12.240> is<00:05:12.449> the<00:05:12.840> better

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
more subdivided your mesh is the better

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.140 
more subdivided your mesh is the better
activity<00:05:13.590> you<00:05:13.680> get<00:05:13.889> and<00:05:14.160> you<00:05:14.669> know<00:05:14.789> maybe<00:05:15.060> you

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
activity you get and you know maybe you

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.120 
activity you get and you know maybe you
want<00:05:15.240> to<00:05:15.509> do<00:05:15.690> something<00:05:16.199> let<00:05:16.410> me<00:05:16.440> just<00:05:16.740> control

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
want to do something let me just control
