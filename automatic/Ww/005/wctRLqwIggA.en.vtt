00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.470
 hi everyone i hope you 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.389
 be well 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.549
 today in this new video I 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:14.140
 you presented my top 15 small 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:16.270
 changes that have been made 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.099
 eyeos new and we'll start everything from 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.270
 following the first big change but 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:20.710
 it's a little bit of a feature 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.689
 hidden is that you can dice 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.790
 set up a six-digit code 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.040
 now when I go to his screen 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.970
 locked and that slide now via 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.970
 a six-digit code 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.010
 little novelty too when you have 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.470
 a notification and you 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.480
 unlock your device hop there is to 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.610
 a new animation in the messages 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.690
 the camera button has changed too 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.730
 now he is at war like this 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.750
 you have access to the camera and 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.879
 videos quickly 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.890
 it's a small novelty but it's 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.570
 always nice to note in 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.400
 the photos app too you can 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.290
 select photos just in 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.420
 therefore pressing forward had to press 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.129
 one by one the images to be able to 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.440
 select now you drag and 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.899
 drop and you can select full 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.520
 image in the app notes you 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:10.259
 can create groups so that's 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.350
 rather nice comparison I want to do 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.490
 a group of novelties hop I just 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.740
 to select the notes I want 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.660
 put in the novelties and it's good 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.490
 and you also have a category that 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.039
 was added by default it's the 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.660
 notes were deleted in the 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:26.460
 notifications you can group 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.960
 this one by group so for example 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.000
 you can group all the games of one 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.649
 shot and then you can remove 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.270
 all notifications at once 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:34.860
 of all these games but if you want 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.729
 to be activated you do not have to do them 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.850
 one by one 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.229
 you just have to activate the group on 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.670
 stays in the notification center and 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.470
 when we go down we have a new 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.660
 tab that can be added is the 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.670
 batteries so in this one you can 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.679
 see the battery of your iphone or 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.509
 your apple watch or like that not obliged 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:54.090
 to go Czech the battery of this one 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.950
 if she is away from you contacts 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.440
 recent who was selling multitasking 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.819
 at this place there have changed places they 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.099
 are now in the spotlight with 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:03.899
 proactive and basically it gives you 

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:05.970
 some suggestions from friends that you 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.920
 have contacted recently it's not very 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.430
 complete there is no favorite contacts 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.410
 for example, but we still have them 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:15.870
 in theory with es9 when branch 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.000
 our headphones the music starts there 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.010
 with this first beta of ios nine that 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.540
 does not work but good in the 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.300
 next beta it happens it will happen 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.920
 the back to button in the bar of 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.870
 status is also a big change 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.060
 by the way s9 I talked about it in my 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.670
 video novelties of ios nine but there 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.200
 I could not avoid it 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.720
 when you click on a news 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.000
 for example it 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.370
 refers you to a page for example that 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.400
 paris is here from the status bar you 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.310
 have the back to button to go back there 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.500
 where you were before a feature 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.840
 very useful of 9 is the low power 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.920
 mode that activates when you go 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.600
 in the settings at the level of the 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.340
 battery section but if you 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.190
 do not have the reflex to go there 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.350
 and although your iPhone alerts you 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.040
 when you have 20% battery 10% of 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.360
 iv act battery with a pop up 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.830
 in the settings elsewhere s9 we can 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.540
 also remove the vibrations 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.310
 if it ever puffs you up and you 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.680
 can delete them 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.890
 very easily always the settings on 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.780
 can change the resolution of videos 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.440
 slowed or not so that's really 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.540
 huge 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.590
 you go here and there you can settle 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.690
 for example 10 81 p 30 fps or 60 fps 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.420
 you decide and we can do 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:33.290
 the same thing with the slow ones with 120 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.760
 and 240 fps in the general settings on 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.410
 can assign a function to the button 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.600
 side that serves either to cut the sound 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.410
 either lock the congo rotation as 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.750
 on our ipad 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.670
 and it works pretty well managed 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.830
 lock unlock unlock 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.450
 it's not cut it's what you want 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.820
 other feature that did its 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.320
 appearance and this will be the last ccar 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.420
 play that made its appearance in the 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.519
 settings so here you can see the 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.769
 available cars via a list and 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.530
 you can activate because that's it 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.120
 this top 15 small modifications that 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.739
 have been brought around ales 9 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.660
 if you want to see the big ones 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.489
 changes the video will be in the 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.380
 description in any case I hope that 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:14.080
 this video pleased you we find ourselves 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.080
 very soon for a next all
