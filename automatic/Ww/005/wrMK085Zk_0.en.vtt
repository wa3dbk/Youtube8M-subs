about five to 12 seconds this depends on

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.960

going to just drop it you're going to

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.120 
going to just drop it you're going to
keep<00:03:30.270> it<00:03:30.390> in<00:03:30.540> your<00:03:30.660> hands<00:03:31.020> about<00:03:31.260> five<00:03:31.590> seconds

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
keep it in your hands about five seconds

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.150

to<00:03:32.520> set<00:03:32.790> it<00:03:32.940> and<00:03:33.210> then<00:03:33.990> for<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.350> next<00:03:34.590> section

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
to set it and then for the next section

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.650 
to set it and then for the next section
we're<00:03:35.340> going<00:03:35.490> to<00:03:35.550> curl<00:03:35.790> it<00:03:35.910> towards<00:03:36.330> the<00:03:36.450> face

we're going to curl it towards the face

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.930 
we're going to curl it towards the face
so<00:03:37.320> we're<00:03:37.530> alternating<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.340> direction<00:03:38.820> of

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
so we're alternating the direction of

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
direction of next section by taking it

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.740 
direction of next section by taking it
towards<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:50.760> face<00:03:50.970> so<00:03:51.210> we're<00:03:51.390> doing<00:03:51.510> this

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
towards the face so we're doing this

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.410

slightly<00:03:54.720> above<00:03:54.990> the<00:03:55.350> temples<00:03:55.770> now<00:03:56.130> this<00:03:56.460> is

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
slightly above the temples now this is

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.790 
slightly above the temples now this is
where<00:03:56.760> we<00:03:56.880> do<00:03:57.000> it<00:03:57.030> slightly<00:03:57.420> differently

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
where we do it slightly differently

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.900 
where we do it slightly differently
we're<00:03:58.800> still<00:03:59.100> going<00:03:59.370> to<00:03:59.490> curl<00:03:59.760> the<00:03:59.880> hair

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
we're still going to curl the hair

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.090 
we're still going to curl the hair
around<00:04:00.450> their<00:04:00.660> hairline<00:04:01.050> away<00:04:01.560> from<00:04:01.770> the<00:04:01.860> face

around their hairline away from the face

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.450 
around their hairline away from the face
however<00:04:03.030> we<00:04:03.330> do<00:04:03.510> it<00:04:03.540> twice<00:04:03.990> so<00:04:04.350> first<00:04:04.980> section

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460 
however we do it twice so first section

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:12.560 
however we do it twice so first section
curl<00:04:05.790> it<00:04:05.910> away<00:04:06.180> from<00:04:06.330> the<00:04:06.480> face

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.470 

then<00:04:20.350> we<00:04:20.650> alternate<00:04:21.430> by<00:04:21.610> taking<00:04:21.940> it<00:04:22.030> towards<00:04:22.390> a

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480
