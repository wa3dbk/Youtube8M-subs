00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.209 
I've put them all here on the wall like
I<00:00:44.340> said<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.960> admit<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.280> it's<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.550> it's<00:00:47.969> tacky<00:00:49.219> but

I<00:00:51.079> figure<00:00:52.079> it's<00:00:52.170> better<00:00:52.320> than<00:00:52.559> just

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
I figure it's better than just

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.569 
I figure it's better than just
collecting<00:00:53.250> dust<00:00:53.420> where<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.449> had<00:00:54.750> them<00:00:54.930> just

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579

with just setting in a old magazine rack

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.450 
with just setting in a old magazine rack
