but<00:00:38.640> guess<00:00:39.329> what<00:00:39.770> it<00:00:40.770> did<00:00:41.399> not<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.719> are<00:00:42.930> 90

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
but guess what it did not the are 90

for a double and let me show you what
exactly<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:51.059> difference<00:00:51.600> between<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.440> and

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
exactly the difference between it is and

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.430 
exactly the difference between it is and
why<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.219> didn't<00:00:53.789> work<00:00:53.930> we<00:00:54.930> were<00:00:55.050> able<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.350> get

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
it on and we were able to adjust it for

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.389 
it on and we were able to adjust it for
the<00:00:57.360> big<00:00:57.570> one<00:00:57.719> in<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.899> little<00:00:58.260> one<00:00:58.379> in<00:00:58.590> terms

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
the big one in the little one in terms

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.400 
the big one in the little one in terms
of<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.670> cliq<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.149> whatnot<00:01:00.449> in<00:01:00.570> cable<00:01:00.960> tension

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
of the cliq and whatnot in cable tension

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.200 
of the cliq and whatnot in cable tension
which<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.680> very<00:01:02.010> critical<00:01:02.309> cable<00:01:02.940> tension

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
which is very critical cable tension

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.179 
which is very critical cable tension
very<00:01:03.570> critical<00:01:04.049> on<00:01:04.170> any<00:01:04.409> kind<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.739> index

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
very critical on any kind of index

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.490 
very critical on any kind of index
system<00:01:05.570> then<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.720> wouldn't<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:07.140> wouldn't<00:01:07.320> make

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
system then it wouldn't it wouldn't make

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.929 
system then it wouldn't it wouldn't make
it<00:01:07.560> all<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.830> way<00:01:07.920> up<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.220> top<00:01:08.340> one<00:01:08.790> no

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
it all the way up to the top one no

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.810 
it all the way up to the top one no
matter<00:01:09.060> what<00:01:09.330> we<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.689> know<00:01:09.780> cable<00:01:10.320> tensioner

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
matter what we you know cable tensioner

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.399 
matter what we you know cable tensioner
so<00:01:11.820> then<00:01:12.000> we<00:01:12.090> adjusted<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.930> top<00:01:13.110> one

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
so then we adjusted it to the top one

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.899 
so then we adjusted it to the top one
and<00:01:13.439> we<00:01:13.740> can<00:01:13.890> make<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.159> go<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.490> top<00:01:14.700> one

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
and we can make it go to the top one

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.760 
and we can make it go to the top one
into<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.330> middle<00:01:15.600> one<00:01:15.750> but<00:01:16.229> we<00:01:16.350> couldn't<00:01:16.590> make

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
into the middle one but we couldn't make

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.440 
into the middle one but we couldn't make
it<00:01:16.799> go<00:01:17.040> down<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.520> bottom<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.330> was

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
it go down to the bottom and it was

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.789 
it go down to the bottom and it was
making<00:01:18.780> noise<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.740> other

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
making noise and this that and the other

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.020

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
whatever I had to really look this one

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.859 
whatever I had to really look this one
over<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:56.969> really<00:01:57.090> had<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.390> get<00:01:57.540> into<00:01:57.750> my

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
over and really had to get into my

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.510 
over and really had to get into my
engineering<00:01:58.380> because<00:01:58.590> again<00:01:58.979> we<00:01:59.130> looked<00:01:59.369> at

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
engineering because again we looked at

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.920 
engineering because again we looked at
them<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.700> they<00:01:59.820> really<00:02:00.149> look<00:02:00.329> nice<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.810> they

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
them and they really look nice and they

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.780 
them and they really look nice and they
look<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.439> same<00:02:01.469> length<00:02:02.040> everything<00:02:02.490> else<00:02:02.640> but

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
look the same length everything else but

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.069 
look the same length everything else but
here's<00:02:03.000> where<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.329> differences<00:02:03.810> are<00:02:03.840> going

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
here's where the differences are going

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.649 
here's where the differences are going
to<00:02:04.140> start<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.500> lock<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:05.640> diff<00:02:05.909> distance

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
to start to lock the diff distance

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.889 
to start to lock the diff distance
between<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:08.099> pivot<00:02:08.610> point<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.149> pivot

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
between that pivot point and that pivot

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.160 
between that pivot point and that pivot
point<00:02:10.200> right<00:02:10.440> there<00:02:10.470> let's<00:02:11.430> do<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:12.000> okay

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
point right there let's do it okay

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.420 
point right there let's do it okay
to<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.410> middle<00:02:13.709> I'm<00:02:13.800> not<00:02:13.920> even<00:02:14.099> going<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.250> tell

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
to the middle I'm not even going to tell

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.740 
to the middle I'm not even going to tell
you<00:02:14.550> what<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.819> dimension<00:02:15.270> is<00:02:15.390> I'm<00:02:15.540> just<00:02:15.660> going

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
you what the dimension is I'm just going

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.080 
you what the dimension is I'm just going
to<00:02:15.870> go<00:02:15.930> by<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.349> middle<00:02:16.770> to<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.190> middle<00:02:17.580> I'm

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
to go by the middle to the middle I'm

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.600 
to go by the middle to the middle I'm
lining<00:02:18.420> up<00:02:18.630> my<00:02:18.780> two<00:02:18.840> points<00:02:19.349> point<00:02:19.590> point<00:02:19.830> now

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
lining up my two points point point now

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.880 
lining up my two points point point now
here<00:02:20.819> we<00:02:20.910> go<00:02:21.090> here<00:02:21.300> you<00:02:21.510> can<00:02:22.080> see<00:02:22.349> there's<00:02:22.739> a

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
here we go here you can see there's a

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.430 
here we go here you can see there's a
definite<00:02:23.400> difference<00:02:24.349> approximately<00:02:25.349> i'm

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
definite difference approximately i'm

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.510 
definite difference approximately i'm
going<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.650> say<00:02:25.709> about<00:02:25.830> a<00:02:25.950> quarter<00:02:26.280> of<00:02:26.310> an<00:02:26.430> inch

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
going to say about a quarter of an inch

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.979 
going to say about a quarter of an inch
difference<00:02:26.790> between<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.390> center<00:02:27.750> of<00:02:27.780> that

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
difference between the center of that

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.080 
difference between the center of that
pivot<00:02:28.380> point<00:02:28.560> in<00:02:28.709> that<00:02:28.860> pivot<00:02:29.220> point<00:02:29.430> on<00:02:29.670> this

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
pivot point in that pivot point on this

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.400 
pivot point in that pivot point on this
one<00:02:30.330> here<00:02:31.130> and<00:02:32.130> on<00:02:32.819> this<00:02:32.940> one<00:02:33.120> here<00:02:33.410> there's

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
one here and on this one here there's

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.590 
one here and on this one here there's
your<00:02:34.650> difference<00:02:35.069> another<00:02:35.940> difference<00:02:36.239> that

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
your difference another difference that

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.400 
your difference another difference that
i<00:02:36.690> noticed<00:02:36.900> okay<00:02:37.440> is<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:38.160> throw<00:02:38.930> okay<00:02:39.930> the

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
i noticed okay is the throw okay the

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.500 
i noticed okay is the throw okay the
distance<00:02:40.860> from<00:02:41.040> where<00:02:41.190> my<00:02:41.430> cable<00:02:41.880> attaches<00:02:42.480> to

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
distance from where my cable attaches to

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.809 
distance from where my cable attaches to
this<00:02:42.870> pivot<00:02:43.319> point<00:02:43.590> here<00:02:43.830> again<00:02:44.190> Center<00:02:44.700> to

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
this pivot point here again Center to

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.360 
this pivot point here again Center to
Center<00:02:45.209> I've<00:02:46.019> got<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.410> kind<00:02:46.560> of<00:02:46.650> interpolate<00:02:47.340> I

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
Center I've got to kind of interpolate I

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.280 
Center I've got to kind of interpolate I
might<00:02:47.640> be<00:02:47.790> off<00:02:47.940> a<00:02:47.970> couple<00:02:48.239> of<00:02:48.510> thousands<00:02:49.019> by<00:02:49.140> my

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
might be off a couple of thousands by my

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.550 
might be off a couple of thousands by my
interpolation<00:02:50.130> but<00:02:50.730> you<00:02:51.510> can<00:02:51.690> still<00:02:51.989> see<00:02:52.319> a

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
interpolation but you can still see a

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.830 
interpolation but you can still see a
definite<00:02:53.190> difference<00:02:53.760> of<00:02:54.209> about<00:02:56.690> I'm<00:02:57.690> going

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
definite difference of about I'm going

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.449 
definite difference of about I'm going
to<00:02:57.900> say<00:02:58.140> is<00:02:58.290> sixteenth<00:02:58.709> maybe<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:59.069> little<00:02:59.250> bit

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
to say is sixteenth maybe a little bit

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.830 
to say is sixteenth maybe a little bit
more<00:02:59.700> in<00:03:00.410> center<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.769> center<00:03:02.190> so<00:03:02.940> that<00:03:02.970> arm<00:03:03.510> had

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
more in center to center so that arm had

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.870 
more in center to center so that arm had
all<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:04.530> difference<00:03:04.950> in<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.190> world<00:03:05.370> the

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
all the difference in the world the

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.050 
all the difference in the world the
length<00:03:06.150> of<00:03:06.390> it<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:06.660> how<00:03:07.140> that<00:03:07.200> throw<00:03:08.069> when<00:03:08.910> you

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
length of it and how that throw when you

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.820 
length of it and how that throw when you
hit<00:03:09.299> that<00:03:09.480> click<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:10.080> get<00:03:10.260> it<00:03:10.380> up<00:03:10.530> had

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
hit that click to get it up had

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.860 
hit that click to get it up had
something<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.340> do<00:03:11.519> with<00:03:11.850> that<00:03:11.880> bro<00:03:12.330> for<00:03:12.690> sure

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
something to do with that bro for sure

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.330 
something to do with that bro for sure
that's<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.290> only<00:03:13.709> differences<00:03:14.160> between

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
that's the only differences between

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.580 
that's the only differences between
these<00:03:14.670> things<00:03:14.940> it<00:03:15.360> lined<00:03:15.690> up<00:03:15.900> it<00:03:16.080> did<00:03:16.260> this<00:03:16.380> it

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
these things it lined up it did this it

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.890 
these things it lined up it did this it
did<00:03:16.739> that<00:03:16.920> double<00:03:17.670> triple<00:03:18.120> there's<00:03:18.690> your

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
did that double triple there's your

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.490 
did that double triple there's your
difference<00:03:19.320> there<00:03:19.650> you<00:03:19.799> have<00:03:20.040> it<00:03:20.070> some<00:03:21.500> again

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
difference there you have it some again

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.289 
difference there you have it some again
if<00:03:22.859> at<00:03:23.790> first<00:03:23.820> you<00:03:24.299> don't<00:03:24.690> succeed<00:03:26.120> curse<00:03:27.120> a

if at first you don't succeed curse a

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.289
