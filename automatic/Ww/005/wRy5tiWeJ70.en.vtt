00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
captured the central zone at Zone A and

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.540 
captured the central zone at Zone A and
also<00:02:09.990> my<00:02:10.140> teammates<00:02:10.590> are<00:02:10.800> pushing<00:02:11.130> a<00:02:11.310> little

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
also my teammates are pushing a little

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.810 
also my teammates are pushing a little
further<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.300> capturing<00:02:13.050> Zone<00:02:13.440> B<00:02:16.490> that<00:02:17.490> is

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
further and capturing Zone B that is

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:18.560 
further and capturing Zone B that is
correct

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
correct

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.270 
correct
at<00:02:18.960> that<00:02:19.260> point<00:02:19.470> in<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.800> battle<00:02:19.950> that

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
at that point in the battle that

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.580 
at that point in the battle that
attackers<00:02:20.850> were<00:02:21.300> controlling<00:02:21.690> 2/3<00:02:22.320> of<00:02:22.500> the

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
attackers were controlling 2/3 of the

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.220 
attackers were controlling 2/3 of the
battlefield<00:02:23.160> so<00:02:23.460> around<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:23.850> time<00:02:24.420> I<00:02:24.720> decide

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
battlefield so around that time I decide

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.870 
battlefield so around that time I decide
that<00:02:25.260> my<00:02:25.440> services<00:02:26.040> could<00:02:26.190> probably<00:02:26.430> be<00:02:26.670> used

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
that my services could probably be used

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.450 
that my services could probably be used
elsewhere<00:02:27.680> thankfully<00:02:28.680> Lady<00:02:28.890> Anne<00:02:29.070> was<00:02:29.250> ready

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
elsewhere thankfully Lady Anne was ready
