00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
looks pretty easy as of now but it does

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.729 
looks pretty easy as of now but it does
get<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.030> little<00:00:39.180> bit<00:00:39.420> harder<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.899> don't<00:00:40.620> would

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
get a little bit harder I don't would

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.869 
get a little bit harder I don't would
never<00:00:41.280> say<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.579> actually<00:00:41.879> gets<00:00:41.969> hard<00:00:43.040> um<00:00:44.040> but

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
never say it actually gets hard um but

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.810 
never say it actually gets hard um but
there<00:00:45.030> are<00:00:45.059> some<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.629> bugs<00:00:45.809> later<00:00:46.110> on<00:00:46.820> to

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
there are some and of bugs later on to

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.900 
there are some and of bugs later on to
get<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.030> little<00:00:48.149> bit<00:00:48.300> annoying<00:00:48.570> but<00:00:49.910> not

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
get a little bit annoying but not

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.150 
get a little bit annoying but not
anything<00:00:51.629> can't<00:00:52.500> be<00:00:52.620> done<00:00:53.660> still<00:00:54.660> pretty<00:00:54.750> easy

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.790 

you<00:00:58.160> have<00:00:58.309> a<00:00:58.340> lot<00:00:58.579> of<00:00:58.610> star<00:00:58.879> bits<00:00:59.059> here<00:00:59.210> I<00:00:59.800> just

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
you have a lot of star bits here I just

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.760 
you have a lot of star bits here I just
got<00:01:00.950> six<00:01:01.250> feet<00:01:01.399> from<00:01:02.270> my<00:01:02.600> brain<00:01:02.930> okay<00:01:03.649> this

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
got six feet from my brain okay this

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.280 
got six feet from my brain okay this
part<00:01:03.980> actually<00:01:04.100> it's<00:01:04.369> kind<00:01:04.550> of<00:01:04.580> annoying<00:01:06.580> but

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
part actually it's kind of annoying but

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.490 
part actually it's kind of annoying but
basically<00:01:09.369> just<00:01:10.570> take<00:01:11.570> it<00:01:11.690> slow<00:01:11.930> and<00:01:11.960> jumping

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
basically just take it slow and jumping

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.320 
basically just take it slow and jumping
over<00:01:12.800> this<00:01:12.920> part<00:01:13.250> makes<00:01:13.970> a<00:01:14.119> lot<00:01:14.300> easier

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
over this part makes a lot easier

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.990 
over this part makes a lot easier
instead<00:01:14.840> about<00:01:15.080> to<00:01:15.200> turn<00:01:15.320> to<00:01:15.440> climb<00:01:15.650> it<00:01:19.000> but

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
instead about to turn to climb it but

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.430 
instead about to turn to climb it but
literally<00:01:20.240> if<00:01:20.330> you<00:01:20.390> get<00:01:20.540> hit<00:01:20.720> by<00:01:20.810> anything<00:01:21.140> we

literally if you get hit by anything we

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.880 
literally if you get hit by anything we
will<00:01:21.680> die<00:01:21.830> any<00:01:22.610> of<00:01:22.850> the<00:01:22.940> meteors<00:01:23.890> they're

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
will die any of the meteors they're

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.600 
will die any of the meteors they're
gonna<00:01:25.040> die<00:01:25.250> so<00:01:25.700> just<00:01:26.920> when<00:01:27.920> I<00:01:27.950> part<00:01:28.490> they

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
gonna die so just when I part they

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:35.430 
gonna die so just when I part they
appear<00:01:28.850> on<00:01:29.030> so<00:01:32.140> they're<00:01:33.140> gone<00:01:33.320> I'll<00:01:34.190> them<00:01:34.429> and

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
if there was anything that could have

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.590 
if there was anything that could have
made<00:01:37.910> you<00:01:38.539> lose<00:01:38.780> your<00:01:38.810> B<00:01:39.140> power<00:01:39.380> um<00:01:40.300> they<00:01:41.300> keep

getting<00:01:59.960> hit<00:02:00.200> by<00:02:00.229> them<00:02:00.590> and<00:02:01.130> since<00:02:01.640> we<00:02:01.789> do<00:02:01.910> our

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179 
getting hit by them and since we do our

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:06.370 
getting hit by them and since we do our
quirky<00:02:02.690> thing<00:02:02.899> before<00:02:03.319> they<00:02:03.550> attack<00:02:04.550> you<00:02:05.380> it's

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
quirky thing before they attack you it's

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.740 
quirky thing before they attack you it's
nothing<00:02:06.830> really<00:02:06.860> that<00:02:07.069> hard

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:20.770 

the<00:02:12.750> fish<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.290> flu<00:02:13.590> oh<00:02:13.620> really<00:02:13.950> half<00:02:14.220> now

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.119 

then<00:02:21.780> there's<00:02:21.930> something<00:02:22.260> here<00:02:22.439> that<00:02:22.470> rotate

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
then there's something here that rotate

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.100 
then there's something here that rotate
and<00:02:24.030> they'll<00:02:24.209> notice<00:02:24.510> when<00:02:24.659> you<00:02:24.720> get<00:02:24.870> on<00:02:24.959> an

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
and they'll notice when you get on an

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.460 
and they'll notice when you get on an
adjacent<00:02:25.470> honeycomb<00:02:26.959> but<00:02:27.959> it's<00:02:28.140> still<00:02:28.290> not

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
adjacent honeycomb but it's still not

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
that's why they put it there all right I

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.679

see<00:02:37.349> now<00:02:37.760> of<00:02:38.760> course<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.090> make<00:02:39.239> a<00:02:39.269> point<00:02:39.480> of

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:39.689 
see now of course I make a point of

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:41.119 
see now of course I make a point of
noting<00:02:39.900> that<00:02:40.079> it<00:02:40.439> seems<00:02:40.680> like<00:02:40.799> they<00:02:40.920> didn't

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
noting that it seems like they didn't

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.000 
noting that it seems like they didn't
have<00:02:41.220> a<00:02:41.250> reason<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.609> put<00:02:41.760> that<00:02:41.879> bee<00:02:42.150> suit<00:02:42.420> there

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
have a reason to put that bee suit there

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.039 
have a reason to put that bee suit there
but<00:02:44.010> that's<00:02:44.250> why<00:02:44.489> case<00:02:44.879> you<00:02:45.030> die<00:02:45.180> directly<00:02:45.689> or

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
but that's why case you die directly or

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.199 
but that's why case you die directly or
you<00:02:46.260> lose<00:02:46.409> the<00:02:46.560> B<00:02:46.680> power<00:02:46.859> right<00:02:47.159> above<00:02:47.879> that

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
you lose the B power right above that

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.039 
you lose the B power right above that
plot<00:02:48.870> one<00:02:49.079> you<00:02:49.170> can<00:02:49.319> still<00:02:49.560> get<00:02:49.680> back<00:02:50.989> so<00:02:51.989> i
