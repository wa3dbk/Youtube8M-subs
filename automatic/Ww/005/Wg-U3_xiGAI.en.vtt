that's actually really kind of

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:23.940 
that's actually really kind of
appropriate<00:00:22.330> and<00:00:22.720> put<00:00:22.869> it<00:00:22.990> together<00:00:23.140> and<00:00:23.680> take

know<00:00:37.570> tight<00:00:38.559> in<00:00:38.890> the<00:00:39.070> sense<00:00:39.309> of<00:00:39.400> folds<00:00:39.820> so<00:00:39.940> you

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
know tight in the sense of folds so you

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.580 
know tight in the sense of folds so you
do<00:00:40.360> need<00:00:40.540> a<00:00:40.570> bit<00:00:40.720> of<00:00:40.809> glue<00:00:40.989> to<00:00:41.019> keep<00:00:41.350> everything

together but you do end up getting a

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:46.170 
together but you do end up getting a
really<00:00:43.809> cool<00:00:44.140> kind<00:00:44.379> of<00:00:44.650> star<00:00:45.610> shape<00:00:45.909> and<00:00:46.089> then

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
really cool kind of star shape and then

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.549 
really cool kind of star shape and then
depending<00:00:46.420> on<00:00:46.659> the<00:00:46.839> kinds<00:00:47.110> of<00:00:47.140> paper<00:00:47.350> you're

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
depending on the kinds of paper you're

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:49.710 
depending on the kinds of paper you're
using<00:00:47.589> and<00:00:48.100> the<00:00:48.159> size<00:00:48.400> you<00:00:49.120> may<00:00:49.269> or<00:00:49.420> may<00:00:49.449> not

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
using and the size you may or may not

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.719 
using and the size you may or may not
have<00:00:49.960> a<00:00:49.989> hole<00:00:50.350> here<00:00:50.830> in<00:00:50.949> the<00:00:51.070> middle<00:00:51.309> that<00:00:51.339> also

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:51.729 
have a hole here in the middle that also

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:54.990 
have a hole here in the middle that also
depends<00:00:52.120> on<00:00:52.269> how<00:00:52.390> long<00:00:52.600> you<00:00:52.659> make<00:00:53.049> the<00:00:53.760> base<00:00:54.760> of

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
depends on how long you make the base of

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.180 
depends on how long you make the base of
the<00:00:55.120> tree<00:00:55.330> different<00:00:56.170> elements<00:00:56.619> like<00:00:56.680> that<00:00:56.799> so

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
the tree different elements like that so

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.950 
the tree different elements like that so
if<00:00:57.369> you<00:00:57.549> really<00:00:58.210> want<00:00:58.390> to<00:00:58.479> avoid<00:00:58.690> that<00:00:58.900> you

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
if you really want to avoid that you

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:59.880 
if you really want to avoid that you
might<00:00:59.140> need<00:00:59.229> to<00:00:59.350> play<00:00:59.440> around<00:00:59.589> with<00:00:59.739> different

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
might need to play around with different

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.500 
might need to play around with different
kinds<00:01:00.250> of<00:01:00.339> papers<00:01:00.640> and<00:01:00.820> things<00:01:01.030> this<00:01:01.239> paper

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
kinds of papers and things this paper

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.560 
kinds of papers and things this paper
that<00:01:01.720> I<00:01:01.780> used<00:01:01.809> is<00:01:02.199> a<00:01:02.229> double-sided<00:01:03.180> foil<00:01:04.180> and

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
that I used is a double-sided foil and

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.170 
that I used is a double-sided foil and
it's<00:01:04.690> really<00:01:04.989> thick<00:01:05.320> and<00:01:05.530> so<00:01:06.159> I<00:01:06.190> wound<00:01:07.090> up

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
it's really thick and so I wound up

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.280 
it's really thick and so I wound up
having<00:01:07.360> to<00:01:07.570> have<00:01:07.659> a<00:01:07.690> little<00:01:07.930> hole<00:01:08.049> in<00:01:08.080> the

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
having to have a little hole in the

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.630 
having to have a little hole in the
middle<00:01:08.500> what<00:01:08.619> I<00:01:08.650> made<00:01:08.860> it<00:01:09.010> but<00:01:09.159> it<00:01:09.340> was<00:01:09.460> with

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
middle what I made it but it was with

today<00:01:13.510> how<00:01:14.080> to<00:01:14.110> put<00:01:14.530> it<00:01:14.619> together<00:01:14.770> using<00:01:15.430> this

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
today how to put it together using this

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.330 
today how to put it together using this
larger<00:01:16.060> paper<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:17.470> is<00:01:17.530> some<00:01:17.860> double-sided

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
larger paper this is some double-sided

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.730 
larger paper this is some double-sided
paper<00:01:18.730> too<00:01:19.030> I'm<00:01:19.540> gonna<00:01:19.660> make<00:01:19.780> my<00:01:19.930> star<00:01:20.290> yellow

paper too I'm gonna make my star yellow

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.820 
paper too I'm gonna make my star yellow
and<00:01:21.040> then<00:01:21.160> have<00:01:21.400> alternating<00:01:22.240> green<00:01:23.200> and<00:01:23.620> red

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
and then have alternating green and red

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.740 
and then have alternating green and red
in<00:01:24.070> the<00:01:24.190> center<00:01:24.400> kind<00:01:24.820> of<00:01:24.940> Christmassy<00:01:25.510> sort

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
in the center kind of Christmassy sort

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.570 
in the center kind of Christmassy sort
of<00:01:25.810> colors<00:01:26.080> so<00:01:26.710> I<00:01:26.740> thought<00:01:27.130> I'd<00:01:27.250> show<00:01:27.430> you<00:01:27.460> guys

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.970 
of colors so I thought I'd show you guys
really<00:01:27.880> quick<00:01:28.150> first<00:01:28.570> just<00:01:29.110> how<00:01:29.350> to<00:01:29.410> make<00:01:29.800> the

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:29.980 
really quick first just how to make the

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.370 
really quick first just how to make the
tree<00:01:30.190> as<00:01:30.400> a<00:01:30.430> reminder<00:01:30.760> and<00:01:31.120> then<00:01:32.080> we'll<00:01:32.260> look

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
tree as a reminder and then we'll look

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.190 
tree as a reminder and then we'll look
at<00:01:32.560> how<00:01:32.680> to<00:01:32.740> put<00:01:33.160> everything<00:01:33.370> together<00:01:34.200> you

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
at how to put everything together you

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.810 
at how to put everything together you
want<00:01:35.350> to<00:01:35.440> kind<00:01:35.620> of<00:01:35.740> start<00:01:36.010> off<00:01:36.160> knowing<00:01:36.640> which

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
want to kind of start off knowing which

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.700 
want to kind of start off knowing which
color<00:01:37.120> you<00:01:37.180> want<00:01:37.510> to<00:01:37.630> be<00:01:37.780> this<00:01:37.960> color<00:01:38.410> of<00:01:38.590> the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
color you want to be this color of the

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.500 
color you want to be this color of the
tree<00:01:39.070> in<00:01:39.310> my<00:01:39.430> case<00:01:39.610> I<00:01:39.730> want<00:01:39.820> my<00:01:40.000> tree<00:01:40.300> to<00:01:40.390> be

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
tree in my case I want my tree to be

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.540 
tree in my case I want my tree to be
yellow<00:01:40.780> and<00:01:41.020> I<00:01:41.050> want<00:01:41.260> my<00:01:41.440> trunk<00:01:42.040> to<00:01:42.100> be<00:01:42.310> green

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
yellow and I want my trunk to be green

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.760 
yellow and I want my trunk to be green
so<00:01:43.270> I'm<00:01:43.600> gonna<00:01:43.720> have<00:01:43.900> that<00:01:44.080> yellow<00:01:44.440> side

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
so I'm gonna have that yellow side

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.710 
so I'm gonna have that yellow side
facing<00:01:45.250> down<00:01:45.280> go<00:01:45.790> ahead<00:01:45.820> and<00:01:46.030> fold<00:01:46.270> everything

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
facing down go ahead and fold everything

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.010 
facing down go ahead and fold everything
in<00:01:46.840> half<00:01:47.050> into<00:01:47.440> a<00:01:47.590> big<00:01:47.950> triangle<00:01:50.700> open<00:01:51.700> it<00:01:51.790> up

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
have it look like a diamond and take

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.030 
have it look like a diamond and take
this<00:01:54.520> top<00:01:54.880> outer<00:01:55.180> edge<00:01:55.540> roll<00:01:56.409> it<00:01:56.590> into<00:01:56.920> the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
this top outer edge roll it into the

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.390 
this top outer edge roll it into the
center

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.880 

and<00:02:01.840> then<00:02:02.840> do<00:02:03.050> the<00:02:03.170> same<00:02:03.350> thing<00:02:03.410> on<00:02:03.710> the<00:02:03.860> other

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
and then do the same thing on the other

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.280 
and then do the same thing on the other
side<00:02:04.100> here<00:02:04.550> too<00:02:04.820> you<00:02:05.600> want<00:02:05.750> to<00:02:05.840> try<00:02:05.990> to<00:02:06.050> keep

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
side here too you want to try to keep

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.650 
side here too you want to try to keep
that<00:02:06.530> tip<00:02:07.040> as<00:02:07.310> clean<00:02:07.610> as<00:02:07.760> you<00:02:07.790> can<00:02:07.970> that<00:02:08.450> makes

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
that tip as clean as you can that makes

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.450 
that tip as clean as you can that makes
the<00:02:08.930> tips<00:02:09.229> of<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:09.530> star<00:02:09.800> so<00:02:10.040> you<00:02:10.130> want<00:02:10.280> to<00:02:10.340> keep

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
the tips of the star so you want to keep

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.120 
the tips of the star so you want to keep
that<00:02:10.640> nice<00:02:11.000> and<00:02:11.240> sharp<00:02:11.620> flip<00:02:12.620> it<00:02:12.740> over<00:02:12.860> and

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
that nice and sharp flip it over and

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.340 
that nice and sharp flip it over and
then<00:02:13.880> I'm<00:02:13.970> gonna<00:02:14.090> take<00:02:14.330> these<00:02:14.630> sides<00:02:14.930> and<00:02:15.170> fold

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
then I'm gonna take these sides and fold

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.440 
then I'm gonna take these sides and fold
them<00:02:15.410> towards<00:02:15.740> the<00:02:15.830> center<00:02:16.100> so<00:02:16.310> we<00:02:17.180> wind<00:02:17.330> up

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
them towards the center so we wind up

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.550 
them towards the center so we wind up
getting<00:02:17.510> kind<00:02:18.050> of<00:02:18.140> this<00:02:19.900> long<00:02:20.900> kite<00:02:21.290> shape

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
getting kind of this long kite shape

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:29.920 
getting kind of this long kite shape
well<00:02:27.520> flip<00:02:28.520> it<00:02:28.610> back<00:02:28.790> over<00:02:29.000> again<00:02:29.390> and<00:02:29.630> then

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
well flip it back over again and then

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.720 
well flip it back over again and then
I'm<00:02:30.020> just<00:02:30.080> gonna<00:02:30.260> fold<00:02:30.740> everything<00:02:31.520> in<00:02:31.610> half

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
I'm just gonna fold everything in half

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.710 
I'm just gonna fold everything in half
when<00:02:34.730> you<00:02:34.760> do<00:02:34.970> this<00:02:35.120> it<00:02:35.330> should<00:02:35.480> come<00:02:35.690> right

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
when you do this it should come right

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.290 
when you do this it should come right
flush<00:02:36.170> with<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:36.560> edges<00:02:36.920> there<00:02:37.160> get<00:02:38.120> good

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
flush with the edges there get good

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.050 
flush with the edges there get good
crease<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:40.040> I'm<00:02:40.130> gonna<00:02:40.250> take<00:02:40.550> this<00:02:40.730> part

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
crease and I'm gonna take this part

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.730 
crease and I'm gonna take this part
where<00:02:41.240> the<00:02:41.600> trunk<00:02:41.840> color<00:02:42.050> is<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:42.440> fold<00:02:42.680> down

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
where the trunk color is and fold down

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.170 
where the trunk color is and fold down
and<00:02:43.130> you<00:02:43.310> can<00:02:43.490> kind<00:02:43.700> of<00:02:43.730> play<00:02:43.850> around<00:02:43.910> with

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
and you can kind of play around with

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.760 
and you can kind of play around with
this<00:02:44.450> like<00:02:44.690> I've<00:02:44.840> said<00:02:45.020> you<00:02:45.230> know<00:02:45.260> and<00:02:45.500> decide

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
this like I've said you know and decide

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.370 
this like I've said you know and decide
how<00:02:45.980> far<00:02:46.190> you<00:02:46.310> want<00:02:46.430> to<00:02:46.580> do<00:02:46.760> things<00:02:47.510> but<00:02:47.900> you<00:02:48.260> do

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
how far you want to do things but you do

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.690 
how far you want to do things but you do
want<00:02:48.560> to<00:02:48.590> make<00:02:48.710> sure<00:02:48.920> that<00:02:49.070> once<00:02:49.250> you've<00:02:49.430> made

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
want to make sure that once you've made

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.120 
want to make sure that once you've made
one<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.720> other<00:02:50.870> five<00:02:51.260> that<00:02:51.290> you<00:02:51.650> make<00:02:51.890> you

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
one the other five that you make you

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.280 
one the other five that you make you
kind<00:02:52.310> of<00:02:52.400> copy<00:02:52.730> the<00:02:53.210> sizing<00:02:53.720> so<00:02:53.960> that<00:02:54.080> pieces

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
kind of copy the sizing so that pieces

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.740 
kind of copy the sizing so that pieces
fit<00:02:54.650> together<00:02:55.010> well<00:02:55.220> and<00:02:55.520> then<00:02:56.300> you<00:02:56.450> can<00:02:56.480> take

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
fit together well and then you can take

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.360 
fit together well and then you can take
a<00:02:56.780> little<00:02:56.960> of<00:02:57.110> this<00:02:57.290> part<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:57.800> fold<00:02:58.100> it<00:02:58.220> up<00:02:58.340> to

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
a little of this part and fold it up to

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.760 
a little of this part and fold it up to
create<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.330> base<00:02:59.510> of<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.140> tree<00:03:00.380> when<00:03:00.680> you

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
create the base of the tree when you

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:01.750 
create the base of the tree when you
flip<00:03:00.950> it<00:03:01.010> over<00:03:01.100> it<00:03:01.250> should<00:03:01.430> look<00:03:01.550> something

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
flip it over it should look something

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.910 
flip it over it should look something
like<00:03:01.940> this<00:03:02.270> and<00:03:02.570> then<00:03:03.290> those<00:03:03.440> are<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:03.650> pieces

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
like this and then those are the pieces

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.290 
like this and then those are the pieces
that<00:03:04.220> we'll<00:03:04.340> use<00:03:04.370> for<00:03:04.580> fitting<00:03:05.090> everything

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
that we'll use for fitting everything

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.600 
that we'll use for fitting everything
together<00:03:05.750> to<00:03:06.110> make<00:03:06.290> the<00:03:06.530> finished<00:03:06.920> kind<00:03:07.340> of

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
together to make the finished kind of

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.210 
together to make the finished kind of
star<00:03:07.940> so<00:03:08.600> I've<00:03:08.930> got<00:03:09.110> all<00:03:09.350> six<00:03:09.650> of<00:03:09.770> my<00:03:09.830> pieces

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
star so I've got all six of my pieces

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.400 
star so I've got all six of my pieces
here<00:03:10.820> and<00:03:11.000> like<00:03:11.480> I<00:03:11.600> said<00:03:11.660> I'm<00:03:11.840> just<00:03:11.870> gonna<00:03:12.140> go

here and like I said I'm just gonna go

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.770 
here and like I said I'm just gonna go
ahead<00:03:12.560> and<00:03:12.739> alternate<00:03:13.550> between<00:03:13.820> each<00:03:14.360> and

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
ahead and alternate between each and

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.020 
ahead and alternate between each and
what<00:03:15.590> we're<00:03:15.739> going<00:03:15.860> to<00:03:15.920> be<00:03:16.070> doing<00:03:16.340> in<00:03:16.730> this

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
what we're going to be doing in this

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.090 
what we're going to be doing in this
case<00:03:17.300> because<00:03:17.660> I<00:03:17.750> can<00:03:18.080> with<00:03:18.350> the<00:03:18.470> sizing<00:03:18.950> of

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
case because I can with the sizing of

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.670 
case because I can with the sizing of
everything<00:03:19.580> is<00:03:19.730> I'm<00:03:20.450> gonna<00:03:20.630> have<00:03:20.930> a<00:03:21.260> little

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
everything is I'm gonna have a little

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.640 
everything is I'm gonna have a little
latch<00:03:21.920> point<00:03:22.340> in<00:03:22.580> this<00:03:23.300> trunk<00:03:23.720> area<00:03:24.140> now<00:03:24.470> like

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
latch point in this trunk area now like

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.590 
latch point in this trunk area now like
when<00:03:24.830> I<00:03:24.860> did<00:03:25.100> the<00:03:25.250> other<00:03:25.489> one<00:03:25.580> because<00:03:26.330> of<00:03:26.480> the

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
when I did the other one because of the

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.720 
when I did the other one because of the
tension<00:03:27.080> of<00:03:27.290> the<00:03:27.470> paper<00:03:27.680> and<00:03:28.100> the<00:03:28.190> size<00:03:28.400> it

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
tension of the paper and the size it

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.460 
tension of the paper and the size it
didn't<00:03:28.970> quite<00:03:29.090> line<00:03:29.480> up<00:03:29.510> to<00:03:29.840> do<00:03:29.959> this<00:03:30.110> but<00:03:30.380> you

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
didn't quite line up to do this but you

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.160 
didn't quite line up to do this but you
can<00:03:30.650> try<00:03:30.920> from<00:03:31.250> the<00:03:31.340> beginning<00:03:31.640> first<00:03:32.030> if<00:03:32.390> you

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
can try from the beginning first if you

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.800 
can try from the beginning first if you
put<00:03:33.380> a<00:03:33.410> little<00:03:33.560> bit<00:03:33.739> of<00:03:33.910> glue<00:03:34.910> on<00:03:35.150> this<00:03:35.450> part

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
put a little bit of glue on this part

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.110 
put a little bit of glue on this part
and<00:03:36.110> slide<00:03:36.500> it<00:03:36.650> underneath<00:03:36.920> and<00:03:37.310> get<00:03:37.459> this<00:03:37.700> tab

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
and slide it underneath and get this tab

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.270 
and slide it underneath and get this tab
to<00:03:38.150> slide<00:03:38.690> into<00:03:38.959> this<00:03:39.440> part<00:03:39.770> that<00:03:39.950> you<00:03:40.040> see

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
to slide into this part that you see

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.940 
to slide into this part that you see
down<00:03:40.430> here<00:03:40.959> and<00:03:41.959> it<00:03:42.080> can<00:03:42.200> just<00:03:42.350> latch<00:03:42.530> a<00:03:42.709> little

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
down here and it can just latch a little

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.960 
down here and it can just latch a little
bit<00:03:43.100> and<00:03:44.410> the<00:03:45.410> rest<00:03:46.310> of<00:03:46.489> everything<00:03:46.820> goes

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
bit and the rest of everything goes

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.600 
bit and the rest of everything goes
behind<00:03:47.180> but<00:03:48.110> then<00:03:48.260> this<00:03:48.560> part<00:03:48.920> stays

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
behind but then this part stays

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.960 
behind but then this part stays
underneath<00:03:50.060> and<00:03:51.190> ideally<00:03:52.190> you<00:03:52.519> want<00:03:52.700> to<00:03:52.790> try

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
underneath and ideally you want to try

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.479 
underneath and ideally you want to try
to<00:03:53.030> create<00:03:53.390> an<00:03:53.810> angle<00:03:54.019> so<00:03:54.440> that<00:03:54.680> things<00:03:55.040> kind

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
to create an angle so that things kind

of come together good here try to keep

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.310 
of come together good here try to keep
these<00:03:58.640> two<00:03:58.850> corners<00:03:59.239> may<00:03:59.450> be<00:03:59.510> matched<00:03:59.840> up<00:04:00.110> if

these two corners may be matched up if

these two corners may be matched up if
you<00:04:00.440> can<00:04:00.850> and<00:04:01.850> then<00:04:02.090> try<00:04:02.480> to<00:04:02.570> keep<00:04:02.750> things<00:04:03.050> sort

you can and then try to keep things sort

everything you know and we'll just try

everything you know and we'll just try

to keep everything in a circle if we can

to keep everything in a circle if we can
these<00:04:11.930> might<00:04:12.170> not<00:04:12.350> quite<00:04:12.829> come<00:04:13.010> together

these might not quite come together
ideally<00:04:14.650> you<00:04:14.800> want<00:04:15.040> to<00:04:15.100> try<00:04:15.340> to<00:04:15.400> get<00:04:16.000> a<00:04:16.269> angle

ideally you want to try to get a angle

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.810 
ideally you want to try to get a angle
so<00:04:17.260> that<00:04:17.290> the<00:04:17.650> side<00:04:18.070> that<00:04:18.100> you<00:04:18.430> see<00:04:18.580> of<00:04:18.640> the

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
so that the side that you see of the

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.729 
so that the side that you see of the
tree<00:04:19.060> is<00:04:19.299> somewhat<00:04:19.750> parallel<00:04:20.170> to<00:04:20.320> the<00:04:20.410> bottom

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
of the tree underneath it that'll help

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.320 
of the tree underneath it that'll help
get<00:04:22.750> the<00:04:22.870> angles<00:04:23.290> for<00:04:23.500> everything<00:04:23.950> so<00:04:24.910> I'm

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
get the angles for everything so I'm

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.940 
get the angles for everything so I'm
just<00:04:25.570> gonna<00:04:25.690> go<00:04:25.930> ahead<00:04:26.050> and<00:04:26.260> like<00:04:26.500> I<00:04:26.530> said<00:04:26.800> and

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
just gonna go ahead and like I said and

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.050 
just gonna go ahead and like I said and
put<00:04:27.100> a<00:04:27.160> little<00:04:27.370> bit<00:04:27.490> of<00:04:27.580> glue<00:04:27.700> you<00:04:27.850> want<00:04:28.000> to

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
put a little bit of glue you want to

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.790 
put a little bit of glue you want to
avoid<00:04:28.240> putting<00:04:28.450> glue<00:04:28.870> you<00:04:29.230> want<00:04:29.320> to<00:04:29.470> put<00:04:29.590> glue

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
avoid putting glue you want to put glue

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.560 
avoid putting glue you want to put glue
on<00:04:29.830> the<00:04:30.130> flap<00:04:30.370> so<00:04:30.580> we're<00:04:30.700> tucking<00:04:31.090> in<00:04:31.300> to<00:04:31.330> the

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
on the flap so we're tucking in to the

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.780 
on the flap so we're tucking in to the
trunks<00:04:31.960> we<00:04:32.560> want<00:04:32.740> to<00:04:32.860> just<00:04:33.070> put<00:04:33.370> stuff<00:04:33.580> that's

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
trunks we want to just put stuff that's

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.970 
trunks we want to just put stuff that's
behind<00:04:34.120> so<00:04:34.600> I'm<00:04:35.140> going<00:04:35.290> to<00:04:35.350> take<00:04:35.470> this<00:04:35.650> green

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
behind so I'm going to take this green

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.520 
behind so I'm going to take this green
one<00:04:36.250> and<00:04:36.460> put<00:04:36.700> glue<00:04:36.940> on<00:04:36.970> the<00:04:37.270> left<00:04:37.540> side<00:04:38.020> just

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
one and put glue on the left side just

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.880 
one and put glue on the left side just
in<00:04:38.650> the<00:04:38.740> left<00:04:38.950> corner<00:04:39.220> and<00:04:40.170> then<00:04:41.170> I<00:04:41.500> can<00:04:41.770> go

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
in the left corner and then I can go

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.640 
in the left corner and then I can go
ahead<00:04:42.160> and<00:04:42.310> keep<00:04:42.490> this<00:04:42.850> connected<00:04:43.780> with<00:04:44.350> this

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
ahead and keep this connected with this

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.260 
ahead and keep this connected with this
part<00:04:44.920> hiding<00:04:45.280> underneath<00:04:45.720> latching<00:04:46.720> in<00:04:47.220> and

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
part hiding underneath latching in and

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.850 
part hiding underneath latching in and
try<00:04:49.270> to<00:04:49.330> keep<00:04:49.510> things<00:04:49.720> kind<00:04:50.050> of<00:04:50.110> lined<00:04:50.350> up<00:04:50.620> here

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
try to keep things kind of lined up here

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.730 
try to keep things kind of lined up here
as<00:04:50.950> much<00:04:50.980> as<00:04:51.160> we<00:04:51.400> can<00:04:51.610> and<00:04:52.260> the<00:04:53.260> connection

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
as much as we can and the connection

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.500 
as much as we can and the connection
point<00:04:54.040> right<00:04:54.280> now<00:04:54.460> like<00:04:54.850> I<00:04:54.940> say<00:04:55.090> it's<00:04:55.330> just

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
point right now like I say it's just

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.210 
point right now like I say it's just
down<00:04:55.690> here<00:04:55.720> right<00:04:56.290> in<00:04:56.410> the<00:04:56.500> center<00:04:56.530> this<00:04:57.130> is<00:04:57.190> a

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
down here right in the center this is a

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.130 
down here right in the center this is a
place<00:04:57.460> where<00:04:57.700> the<00:04:57.820> glue<00:04:57.970> is<00:04:58.090> going<00:04:58.270> to<00:04:58.330> be<00:04:58.480> so

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
place where the glue is going to be so

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.690 
place where the glue is going to be so
I'll<00:04:59.290> just<00:04:59.470> go<00:04:59.620> ahead<00:04:59.770> and<00:04:59.920> do<00:05:00.040> the<00:05:00.190> next<00:05:00.370> piece

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
I'll just go ahead and do the next piece

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.220 
I'll just go ahead and do the next piece
like<00:05:00.910> I<00:05:00.970> said<00:05:01.120> I'm<00:05:01.210> just<00:05:01.240> alternating<00:05:01.870> so

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 
like I said I'm just alternating so

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.500 
like I said I'm just alternating so
again<00:05:02.440> I<00:05:02.530> could<00:05:02.680> put<00:05:02.890> stuff<00:05:03.130> on<00:05:03.490> the<00:05:03.670> glue<00:05:04.090> on

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
again I could put stuff on the glue on

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:11.220 
again I could put stuff on the glue on
the<00:05:04.720> left<00:05:05.050> side<00:05:05.560> here<00:05:09.480> again<00:05:10.480> let<00:05:10.720> it<00:05:10.750> slide

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.230 
the left side here again let it slide

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.820 
the left side here again let it slide
underneath<00:05:11.910> hook<00:05:12.910> under<00:05:13.390> there<00:05:13.630> to<00:05:14.620> keep

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
underneath hook under there to keep

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.520 
underneath hook under there to keep
things<00:05:15.070> as<00:05:15.250> straight<00:05:15.640> as<00:05:15.790> you<00:05:15.820> can<00:05:16.410> and<00:05:17.410> I'll

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
things as straight as you can and I'll

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.140 
things as straight as you can and I'll
just<00:05:17.710> keep<00:05:17.890> going<00:05:18.070> around<00:05:18.370> here<00:05:18.700> until<00:05:18.820> I<00:05:18.970> can

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
just keep going around here until I can

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.930 
just keep going around here until I can
get<00:05:19.270> all<00:05:19.510> six<00:05:19.990> pieces<00:05:20.260> connected<00:05:21.250> so<00:05:21.640> that<00:05:21.669> we

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
get all six pieces connected so that we

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.840 
get all six pieces connected so that we
can<00:05:22.120> see<00:05:22.660> how<00:05:23.080> it<00:05:23.260> looks<00:05:23.440> as<00:05:23.620> a<00:05:23.650> start<00:05:24.070> so<00:05:24.700> when

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:24.850 
can see how it looks as a start so when

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.130 
can see how it looks as a start so when
you<00:05:24.940> finish<00:05:25.240> you<00:05:25.419> might<00:05:25.600> get<00:05:25.780> something<00:05:25.990> like

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.140 
you finish you might get something like

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.780 
you finish you might get something like
this<00:05:26.500> and<00:05:26.830> like<00:05:26.919> I<00:05:27.040> said<00:05:27.220> it's<00:05:27.460> a<00:05:27.550> little

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
this and like I said it's a little

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.310 
this and like I said it's a little
tricky<00:05:28.150> to<00:05:28.180> get<00:05:28.480> everything<00:05:28.720> pieced<00:05:29.110> together

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
tricky to get everything pieced together

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.860 
tricky to get everything pieced together
but<00:05:29.860> if<00:05:30.010> with<00:05:30.220> a<00:05:30.250> little<00:05:30.610> patience<00:05:31.150> you<00:05:31.660> can

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
but if with a little patience you can

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.890 
but if with a little patience you can
kind<00:05:32.080> of<00:05:32.140> get<00:05:32.290> everything<00:05:32.500> tucked<00:05:32.950> in<00:05:33.190> and<00:05:33.900> get

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
kind of get everything tucked in and get

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.740 
kind of get everything tucked in and get
a<00:05:34.930> nice<00:05:35.230> completed<00:05:35.830> six<00:05:36.820> point<00:05:37.090> start<00:05:37.419> and

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
a nice completed six point start and

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.930 
a nice completed six point start and
it's<00:05:38.650> got<00:05:38.860> a<00:05:38.890> fun<00:05:39.160> little<00:05:39.190> pattern<00:05:39.730> in<00:05:39.850> the

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
it's got a fun little pattern in the

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.220 
it's got a fun little pattern in the
middle<00:05:40.150> if<00:05:40.240> you<00:05:40.390> use<00:05:40.570> different<00:05:40.900> colors<00:05:41.140> like

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:41.230 
middle if you use different colors like

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.159 
middle if you use different colors like
I<00:05:41.440> did<00:05:41.730> but<00:05:42.730> it's<00:05:43.090> just<00:05:43.390> sort<00:05:43.540> of<00:05:43.600> a<00:05:43.720> fun<00:05:43.930> way<00:05:44.110> to

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.169 
I did but it's just sort of a fun way to

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:47.730 
I did but it's just sort of a fun way to
take<00:05:44.530> a<00:05:44.560> traditional<00:05:45.060> tree<00:05:46.060> and<00:05:46.930> put<00:05:47.620> it

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
take a traditional tree and put it

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.590 
take a traditional tree and put it
