Kron<00:00:41.700> fours<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.210> in<00:00:42.360> my<00:00:42.540> opinion<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.230> decent

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
Kron fours to in my opinion is a decent

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.450 
Kron fours to in my opinion is a decent
game<00:00:43.950> but<00:00:44.510> it<00:00:45.510> was<00:00:45.840> quite<00:00:46.379> incorrect<00:00:46.829> because

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
game but it was quite incorrect because

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.049 
game but it was quite incorrect because
if<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.780> noticed<00:00:49.350> something<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.309> Spinosaurus

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
if you noticed something the Spinosaurus

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.720 
if you noticed something the Spinosaurus
is<00:00:51.180> about<00:00:51.680> two<00:00:52.680> times<00:00:52.860> smaller<00:00:53.280> than<00:00:53.489> the

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
is about two times smaller than the

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.319 
is about two times smaller than the
t-rex<00:00:54.180> when<00:00:54.949> geologic<00:00:55.949> an<00:00:56.329> ideologically

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
t-rex when geologic an ideologically

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.049 
t-rex when geologic an ideologically
when<00:00:58.289> it's<00:00:58.440> supposed<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.829> be<00:00:58.949> about<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.760> few

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
when it's supposed to be about a few

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.750 
when it's supposed to be about a few
inches<00:01:00.270> taller<00:01:00.719> than<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.260> Rex<00:01:01.609> well<00:01:02.609> of

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
inches taller than the Rex well of

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.189 
inches taller than the Rex well of
course<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:03.180> could<00:01:03.329> settle<00:01:03.600> this<00:01:03.719> with<00:01:04.049> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
course you could settle this with the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.730 
course you could settle this with the
RDS<00:01:04.619> editing<00:01:05.159> but<00:01:05.430> also<00:01:06.330> they<00:01:06.840> also<00:01:07.110> messed<00:01:07.470> up

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
RDS editing but also they also messed up

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.000 
RDS editing but also they also messed up
with<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.070> Stegosaurus<00:01:08.930> spinous<00:01:10.010> re-set

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
with the Stegosaurus spinous re-set

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.859 
with the Stegosaurus spinous re-set
spinosaurus<00:01:12.140> Stegosaurus<00:01:13.140> ankylosaurus

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
spinosaurus Stegosaurus ankylosaurus

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:21.200 
spinosaurus Stegosaurus ankylosaurus
ceratosaurus<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:18.560> think<00:01:19.560> that's<00:01:19.710> about<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:20.210> but

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
ceratosaurus I think that's about it but

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.560 
ceratosaurus I think that's about it but
yeah<00:01:21.500> but<00:01:22.500> back<00:01:22.680> then<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:23.189> meant<00:01:23.460> not<00:01:24.360> many

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
yeah but back then that meant not many

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.690 
yeah but back then that meant not many
people<00:01:24.930> knew<00:01:25.170> about<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.740> Spinosaurus<00:01:26.460> about

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
people knew about the Spinosaurus about

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.630 
people knew about the Spinosaurus about
size<00:01:27.380> strengths<00:01:28.380> weaknesses<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.280> all<00:01:29.430> that

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
size strengths weaknesses and all that

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.719 
size strengths weaknesses and all that
but<00:01:30.420> anyways<00:01:30.840> i<00:01:32.570> think<00:01:33.950> when<00:01:34.950> i<00:01:34.979> first<00:01:35.340> got<00:01:35.430> the

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
but anyways i think when i first got the

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.630 
but anyways i think when i first got the
game<00:01:36.320> at<00:01:37.320> first<00:01:37.590> i<00:01:37.799> thought<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:38.009> would<00:01:38.310> be<00:01:38.430> like

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
game at first i thought it would be like

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.780 
game at first i thought it would be like
a<00:01:38.700> short<00:01:39.560> basically<00:01:40.560> like<00:01:40.740> carnivores<00:01:41.250> one<00:01:41.549> if

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
a short basically like carnivores one if

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.490 
a short basically like carnivores one if
you<00:01:41.880> ever<00:01:42.000> played<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.479> before<00:01:42.540> it's<00:01:42.930> rare<00:01:43.200> game

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
you ever played it before it's rare game

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.630 
you ever played it before it's rare game
now<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.009> caused<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.490> phenomena<00:01:45.090> like<00:01:45.380> but

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.560 

carnivores<00:01:49.640> to<00:01:49.880> is<00:01:50.030> slightly<00:01:50.390> more

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
carnivores to is slightly more

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.540 
carnivores to is slightly more
significant<00:01:51.470> because<00:01:51.620> now<00:01:51.920> you<00:01:51.980> can<00:01:52.160> just

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
significant because now you can just

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.300 
significant because now you can just
choose<00:01:52.790> more<00:01:53.120> than<00:01:53.180> one<00:01:53.360> dinosaur<00:01:54.160> not<00:01:55.160> only

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
choose more than one dinosaur not only

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.210 
choose more than one dinosaur not only
that<00:01:55.400> you<00:01:55.610> get<00:01:55.880> more<00:01:56.120> tools<00:01:56.660> to<00:01:56.930> work<00:01:56.960> with<00:01:57.220> not

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
that you get more tools to work with not

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.190 
that you get more tools to work with not
like<00:01:58.460> they<00:01:58.640> really<00:01:58.880> help<00:01:59.270> because<00:01:59.450> personally

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
like they really help because personally

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.050 
like they really help because personally
I<00:02:00.260> still<00:02:00.590> get<00:02:00.740> detected<00:02:01.280> even<00:02:01.400> with<00:02:01.730> all<00:02:01.910> the

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
I still get detected even with all the

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:10.210 
I still get detected even with all the
stuff<00:02:02.330> on<00:02:02.710> but<00:02:03.710> anyways<00:02:08.050> the<00:02:09.050> game<00:02:09.290> itself<00:02:09.470> is

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
stuff on but anyways the game itself is

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.920 
stuff on but anyways the game itself is
really<00:02:10.460> really<00:02:10.820> challenging<00:02:11.120> if<00:02:11.630> you<00:02:11.750> don't

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
really really challenging if you don't

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.640 
really really challenging if you don't
use<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.260> cheats<00:02:13.660> but<00:02:14.660> it's<00:02:14.870> pretty<00:02:15.080> fun<00:02:15.380> to<00:02:15.500> do

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
use the cheats but it's pretty fun to do

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.620 
use the cheats but it's pretty fun to do
with<00:02:15.800> t-rex<00:02:16.190> chase<00:02:16.490> as<00:02:16.760> if<00:02:16.970> you<00:02:17.120> could<00:02:17.270> tell<00:02:17.390> by

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
with t-rex chase as if you could tell by
