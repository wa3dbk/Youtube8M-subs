00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
straight lines on this nail and we're

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.890 
straight lines on this nail and we're
gonna<00:03:34.319> do<00:03:34.410> a<00:03:34.470> grid<00:03:34.680> pattern<00:03:35.420> the<00:03:36.420> easiest<00:03:36.750> way

gonna do a grid pattern the easiest way

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.420 
gonna do a grid pattern the easiest way
to<00:03:36.959> do<00:03:37.170> this<00:03:37.200> would<00:03:37.590> be<00:03:37.650> to<00:03:37.769> draw<00:03:38.099> a<00:03:38.130> line<00:03:38.400> in

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
to do this would be to draw a line in

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.160 
to do this would be to draw a line in
the<00:03:38.579> center<00:03:39.000> and<00:03:39.030> then<00:03:39.269> meet<00:03:39.569> it<00:03:39.690> up<00:03:39.810> on<00:03:39.989> each

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
the center and then meet it up on each

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.199 
the center and then meet it up on each
side<00:03:40.440> you<00:03:40.739> can<00:03:40.889> continue<00:03:41.190> that<00:03:41.519> along<00:03:41.910> their

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
side you can continue that along their

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.809 
side you can continue that along their
severe<00:03:42.480> now<00:03:42.660> not<00:03:43.530> really<00:03:43.889> sure<00:03:44.130> why<00:03:44.459> I<00:03:44.489> didn't

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819

obviously draw your Center letter first
so<00:03:55.859> find<00:03:56.099> the<00:03:56.220> center<00:03:56.609> of<00:03:56.639> your<00:03:56.819> word<00:03:57.150> and<00:03:57.630> put

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
know in the comments I don't know

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.259 
know in the comments I don't know
lettering<00:04:10.739> could<00:04:10.859> be<00:04:10.980> difficult<00:04:11.519> so<00:04:11.790> you<00:04:11.880> can

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
lettering could be difficult so you can

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.150 
lettering could be difficult so you can
actually<00:04:12.540> omit<00:04:13.109> your<00:04:13.319> striping<00:04:13.709> brush<00:04:13.769> and

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
actually omit your striping brush and

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.089 
actually omit your striping brush and
you<00:04:14.280> can<00:04:14.459> use<00:04:14.700> a<00:04:14.930> Polish<00:04:15.930> pen<00:04:16.260> that<00:04:17.010> would

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.099 
you can use a Polish pen that would

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:18.620 
you can use a Polish pen that would
probably<00:04:17.190> be<00:04:17.459> really<00:04:17.729> easy<00:04:17.880> i've<00:04:18.299> used<00:04:18.479> those

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
probably be really easy i've used those

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.120 
probably be really easy i've used those
before<00:04:18.750> I<00:04:18.959> just<00:04:19.200> don't<00:04:19.349> have<00:04:19.440> them<00:04:19.829> right<00:04:20.010> now

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130
