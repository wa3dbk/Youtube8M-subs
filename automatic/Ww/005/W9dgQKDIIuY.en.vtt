00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:12.019
 so I wondered if 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:14.759
 practically dissolve my idea 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:19.619
 turn back the electricity 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:27.089
 from the welding transformer to the account 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:29.429
 experience is the key from here such a block 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:34.890
 power nothing else I had everything 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:41.060
 from jock to blunt fall from the generator 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.060
 voltage to work 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.050
 directly our key here on 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.410
 secondary winding 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.910
 the light bulb is simple and our battery is 48 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.320
 volt respectively nothing 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.720
 I am not supernatural 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.199
 I tried all the same to work on 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:08.880
 high frequencies regarding me here 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:11.900
 44 kilohertz on the run I think 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:18.020
 that it can be modulated but 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:18.020
 all the same here I run the generator 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.080
 light bulb 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:30.450
 only 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:33.510
 here immediately tension jumped that is 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.150
 power is transmitted and the transformer 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:40.460
 maybe fine as it turns out to work 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:46.820
 Well, I see it somewhere around 5 kilohertz 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:52.140
 his moment here is work directly on 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:57.140
 the keys themselves here we see large 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:02:02.570
 lists back to ds that fall 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:06.720
 respectively on the bulb that's measurements 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.640
 Here it is the key measurements, respectively, I 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:13.830
 so far no doing except 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:18.150
 weekend inside here but i like it like 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:20.970
 Transformer works and I think through 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:28.610
 it can be enough to pump more 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:32.450
 than if it were 50 hertz 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.800
 possible keys will not be so hot and 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.550
 so you can put them 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.760
 some 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:43.190
 parallel two three keys which 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:48.660
 works alternately and give out on trial 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:50.489
 220 volts what we need it can be 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.430
 of course at the exit of some kind of warehouses 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.480
 smoothing capacitor which will 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:00.030
 stand parallel 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:04.790
 secondary winding here is but sound to me 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.790
 like it works quite easily 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.310
 the key is still warming 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:16.090
 again it depends on the property itself 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:22.670
 the keys themselves if poleviki put here 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:25.250
 Here I have this type, that is, you can and 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.010
 add and the resulting reverse emf 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.720
 again run his mind load this 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.410
 reverse game can try 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:37.040
 try to recharge it back 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:40.400
 battery and prospects open up 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.190
 all the same more than if we 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.350
 worked 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.030
 directly with a power outlet we 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.310
 until 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.440
 we put aside by the way 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.630
 but maybe it can be 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.150
 valid buffer battery which 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:04:01.930
 interacts with the network and such options 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:05.330
 are possible well as long as one key 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:08.870
 having these voltages with power 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:13.180
 I'm not fighting yet because with that 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:17.209
 There is all thank you for your attention 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:19.780
 It is worth doing this, of course, all 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.780
 until
