ear with two rows of kernels that are
triangular<00:00:31.560> shaped<00:00:31.830> they<00:00:32.610> have<00:00:32.730> an<00:00:32.820> extremely

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
triangular shaped they have an extremely

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.370 
triangular shaped they have an extremely
hard<00:00:33.750> pericarp<00:00:34.380> on<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.680> outside<00:00:35.100> or

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
hard pericarp on the outside or

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.360 
hard pericarp on the outside or
extremely<00:00:37.380> hard<00:00:37.620> texture<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:37.980> mean<00:00:38.040> really

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
extremely hard texture I mean really

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.950 
extremely hard texture I mean really
almost<00:00:38.520> like<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.790> rock<00:00:39.090> hmm

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
almost like a rock hmm

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.560 
almost like a rock hmm
but<00:00:40.649> as<00:00:41.370> we<00:00:41.550> understand<00:00:42.000> in<00:00:42.120> those<00:00:42.210> days<00:00:42.450> it

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
but as we understand in those days it

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.130 
but as we understand in those days it
was<00:00:42.690> used<00:00:42.899> as<00:00:43.079> either<00:00:43.290> an<00:00:43.500> emergency<00:00:44.010> food<00:00:44.309> or

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
was used as either an emergency food or

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.720 
was used as either an emergency food or
birds<00:00:46.140> would<00:00:46.410> try<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.620> consume<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.640> they

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
birds would try to consume it and they

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.889 
birds would try to consume it and they
would<00:00:47.879> eventually<00:00:48.030> just<00:00:48.329> pass<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.780> through

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
would eventually just pass it through

00:00:48.899 --> 00:01:07.149 
would eventually just pass it through
and<00:01:03.260> they<00:01:04.260> look<00:01:04.500> like<00:01:04.820> very<00:01:05.820> very<00:01:06.450> small

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
and they look like very very small

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:13.730 
and they look like very very small

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
brownish black rocks in it harvest

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.740 
brownish black rocks in it harvest
itself<00:01:14.100> by<00:01:14.430> just<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.850> just<00:01:14.880> falls<00:01:15.270> over<00:01:15.420> and

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
itself by just it just falls over and

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.570 
itself by just it just falls over and
the<00:01:15.900> seeds<00:01:16.320> just<00:01:16.439> fall<00:01:16.650> down<00:01:16.680> on<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.040> ground

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.300 

yeah<00:01:23.750> we<00:01:24.750> use<00:01:24.960> utilize<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.830> plant

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
yeah we use utilize the plant

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.460 
yeah we use utilize the plant

as part of United States Department of
Ag<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.479> source<00:01:30.750> all<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.170> seed<00:01:31.409> through<00:01:32.100> their

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
Ag to source all the seed through their

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.679 
Ag to source all the seed through their
seed<00:01:32.460> bank<00:01:34.610> and<00:01:35.610> then<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.090> know<00:01:36.210> we<00:01:36.330> progress

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
seed bank and then you know we progress

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.660 
seed bank and then you know we progress
from<00:01:36.840> this<00:01:37.049> then<00:01:37.229> we<00:01:37.320> move<00:01:37.500> into<00:01:37.710> like<00:01:37.890> 1700's

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
from this then we move into like 1700's

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.899 
from this then we move into like 1700's
and<00:01:38.759> 1800's<00:01:39.210> here<00:01:39.600> with<00:01:39.780> Indian<00:01:40.170> corn<00:01:40.909> Tama

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
and 1800's here with Indian corn Tama

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.440 
and 1800's here with Indian corn Tama
Flint<00:01:42.320> so<00:01:43.320> this<00:01:43.440> is<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.619> similar<00:01:44.520> type<00:01:45.390> of

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
Flint so this is a similar type of

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.999 
Flint so this is a similar type of
variety<00:01:45.690> that<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.440> Indians<00:01:46.740> would<00:01:46.890> have

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
variety that the Indians would have

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.310 
variety that the Indians would have
planted<00:01:47.690> you<00:01:48.690> know<00:01:48.780> it's<00:01:48.930> got<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.289> the

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
planted you know it's got the the

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.139 
planted you know it's got the the
multicolored<00:01:50.159> seeds<00:01:50.430> like<00:01:50.640> we<00:01:50.759> often<00:01:51.030> think

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
multicolored seeds like we often think

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.719 
multicolored seeds like we often think
of<00:01:51.360> with<00:01:51.570> Indian<00:01:52.049> corn<00:01:52.399> but<00:01:53.399> what's<00:01:53.580> unique

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
of with Indian corn but what's unique

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.550 
of with Indian corn but what's unique
about<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.330> and<00:01:54.630> this<00:01:55.080> is<00:01:55.229> truly<00:01:55.470> a

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
about this and this is truly a

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.899 
about this and this is truly a
replication<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.250> how<00:01:56.490> they<00:01:56.640> would<00:01:56.819> have

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
replication of how they would have

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.790 
replication of how they would have
planted<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.360> back<00:01:57.600> then<00:01:57.869> we've<00:01:58.500> got<00:01:58.679> the

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
planted it back then we've got the

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.680 
planted it back then we've got the
squash<00:01:59.159> in<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.490> middle<00:01:59.759> as<00:01:59.909> an<00:02:00.270> additional

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
squash in the middle as an additional

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.450 
squash in the middle as an additional
food<00:02:00.899> source<00:02:01.200> as<00:02:01.409> well<00:02:01.560> as<00:02:01.619> shading<00:02:02.100> for<00:02:02.250> wreak

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
food source as well as shading for wreak

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.960 
food source as well as shading for wreak
control<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.090> then<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.869> pole<00:02:04.200> beans<00:02:04.940> again<00:02:05.940> a

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
control and then the pole beans again a

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.210 
control and then the pole beans again a
food<00:02:06.240> source<00:02:06.509> as<00:02:06.929> well<00:02:07.470> as<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.619> nitrogen<00:02:07.890> source

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
food source as well as a nitrogen source

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.669 
food source as well as a nitrogen source
for<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.759> next<00:02:09.000> year<00:02:09.289> and<00:02:10.289> then<00:02:10.440> they<00:02:10.530> also

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
for the next year and then they also

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.250 
for the next year and then they also
believe<00:02:11.100> that<00:02:11.130> as<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.670> grew<00:02:12.269> up<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.750> stock<00:02:13.080> it

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
believe that as it grew up the stock it

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.050 
believe that as it grew up the stock it
would<00:02:13.380> help<00:02:13.500> first<00:02:13.769> and<00:02:14.010> ability<00:02:14.400> purposes<00:02:14.910> as

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
would help first and ability purposes as

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:34.270 
would help first and ability purposes as
well<00:02:24.950> culturally<00:02:27.200> it's<00:02:28.200> growing<00:02:28.500> stopping

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.819 

yeah<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.970> then<00:02:36.150> so<00:02:36.480> then<00:02:36.660> we<00:02:37.380> move<00:02:37.590> into<00:02:37.709> the

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
yeah and then so then we move into the

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:39.410 
yeah and then so then we move into the
early<00:02:37.890> 1800s<00:02:38.700> this<00:02:38.910> would<00:02:39.090> be<00:02:39.209> like<00:02:39.359> a

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
early 1800s this would be like a

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.900 
early 1800s this would be like a
southeastern<00:02:40.170> United<00:02:40.530> States<00:02:40.730> variety<00:02:41.730> where

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
southeastern United States variety where

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.120 
southeastern United States variety where
you<00:02:42.120> know<00:02:42.239> real<00:02:42.420> tall<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:42.690> very<00:02:43.350> long<00:02:43.590> season

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
you know real tall and very long season

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.789 
you know real tall and very long season
real<00:02:44.940> long<00:02:45.120> growing<00:02:45.329> season<00:02:45.780> so<00:02:45.930> that's<00:02:46.410> it's

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
real long growing season so that's it's

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.800 
real long growing season so that's it's
identified<00:02:47.459> as<00:02:47.579> gourd<00:02:47.820> see<00:02:48.030> cuz<00:02:48.269> the<00:02:48.480> the

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
identified as gourd see cuz the the

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.449 
identified as gourd see cuz the the
kernels<00:02:49.320> are<00:02:49.440> almost<00:02:49.709> like<00:02:49.829> a<00:02:49.859> pumpkin<00:02:50.190> see

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
kernels are almost like a pumpkin see

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.240 
kernels are almost like a pumpkin see
they're<00:02:50.640> really<00:02:50.730> deep<00:02:51.650> large<00:02:52.650> kernels<00:02:53.100> and

named after a father and son from the
1840s<00:03:28.880> in<00:03:29.090> Ohio<00:03:29.870> they<00:03:30.740> relocated<00:03:31.250> to<00:03:31.400> Illinois

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
1840s in Ohio they relocated to Illinois

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.040 
1840s in Ohio they relocated to Illinois
and<00:03:32.710> planted<00:03:33.710> some<00:03:34.010> of<00:03:34.790> the<00:03:35.090> Gordon<00:03:35.390> seed<00:03:35.630> that

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
and planted some of the Gordon seed that

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.490 
and planted some of the Gordon seed that
they<00:03:36.170> brought<00:03:36.380> with<00:03:36.590> them<00:03:38.380> so<00:03:39.380> they

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
they brought with them so they

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.250 
they brought with them so they
interceded<00:03:40.130> an<00:03:41.030> earlier<00:03:41.450> season<00:03:41.720> variety

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
interceded an earlier season variety

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.350 
interceded an earlier season variety
from<00:03:42.470> the<00:03:42.560> north<00:03:42.770> of<00:03:43.010> flint<00:03:43.220> variety<00:03:43.580> so<00:03:44.270> they

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
from the north of flint variety so they

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.840 
from the north of flint variety so they
had<00:03:44.480> crossbreeding<00:03:45.080> to<00:03:45.260> take<00:03:45.560> place<00:03:45.770> and<00:03:46.460> they

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
had crossbreeding to take place and they

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.310 
had crossbreeding to take place and they
continued<00:03:47.270> to<00:03:47.300> say<00:03:47.510> back<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:47.900> seed<00:03:48.140> year

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
continued to say back the seed year

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.170 
continued to say back the seed year
after<00:03:48.590> year<00:03:48.800> and<00:03:48.920> what<00:03:49.550> eventually<00:03:49.790> they<00:03:50.120> were

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
after year and what eventually they were

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.840 
after year and what eventually they were
able<00:03:50.390> to<00:03:50.570> develop<00:03:50.990> essentially<00:03:51.980> was<00:03:52.250> a<00:03:52.460> really

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
able to develop essentially was a really

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.290 
able to develop essentially was a really
robust<00:03:53.390> high<00:03:53.660> yielding<00:03:54.250> variety<00:03:55.250> that<00:03:56.090> had<00:03:56.270> a

harvestable ears per plant and the other
interesting<00:04:00.710> thing<00:04:01.130> is<00:04:01.310> as<00:04:01.640> you<00:04:01.700> think<00:04:02.000> about

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
interesting thing is as you think about

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.140 
interesting thing is as you think about
how<00:04:02.390> agriculture<00:04:02.750> has<00:04:03.140> evolved<00:04:03.590> the<00:04:04.580> planting

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
how agriculture has evolved the planting

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.420 
how agriculture has evolved the planting
here<00:04:05.420> of<00:04:05.630> putting<00:04:06.230> them<00:04:06.380> in<00:04:06.530> hills<00:04:06.800> or<00:04:07.040> clumps

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
here of putting them in hills or clumps

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.730 
here of putting them in hills or clumps
of<00:04:07.580> glorified<00:04:08.090> seeds<00:04:08.390> per<00:04:08.600> clump<00:04:08.870> with<00:04:09.620> the

of glorified seeds per clump with the

hope that at least one of the kernels

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.240 
hope that at least one of the kernels
would<00:04:11.360> germinate<00:04:11.510> and<00:04:12.020> then<00:04:12.740> the<00:04:12.830> other<00:04:12.950> thing

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
would germinate and then the other thing

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.850 
would germinate and then the other thing
here<00:04:13.490> is<00:04:13.610> the<00:04:14.510> wide<00:04:14.690> spacing<00:04:15.230> allows<00:04:15.470> for<00:04:15.770> the
