00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.750 

and<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:07.529> reason<00:00:07.649> I'm<00:00:07.890> charging<00:00:08.220> up<00:00:08.429> this<00:00:08.519> gun

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
and the reason I'm charging up this gun

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.520 
and the reason I'm charging up this gun
multiple<00:00:09.150> times<00:00:09.360> is<00:00:09.780> you<00:00:10.110> hear<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.290> slight

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
multiple times is you hear a slight

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.759 
multiple times is you hear a slight
hissing<00:00:11.099> once<00:00:11.759> I've<00:00:11.940> fully<00:00:12.150> charged<00:00:12.540> it<00:00:12.769> that

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
hissing once I've fully charged it that

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.650 
hissing once I've fully charged it that
means<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.160> tank<00:00:14.400> is<00:00:14.580> over<00:00:14.940> pressured<00:00:15.509> and

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
means the tank is over pressured and

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.630 
means the tank is over pressured and
you'll<00:00:16.230> get<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.410> much<00:00:16.470> stronger<00:00:16.859> shot<00:00:17.250> that<00:00:17.490> way

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
you'll get a much stronger shot that way

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.250 
you'll get a much stronger shot that way
but<00:00:17.699> it<00:00:17.850> will<00:00:18.029> slowly<00:00:18.359> wear<00:00:18.660> off<00:00:18.840> after<00:00:19.080> a

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
but it will slowly wear off after a

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:27.589 
but it will slowly wear off after a
while<00:00:24.920> how's<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.099> generator<00:00:26.519> working<00:00:26.849> okay

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
while how's the generator working okay

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.160 
while how's the generator working okay
as<00:00:28.320> long<00:00:28.590> as<00:00:28.800> no<00:00:28.949> one<00:00:28.980> touches<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.640> damn<00:00:30.599> shaky

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
as long as no one touches it damn shaky

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.319 
as long as no one touches it damn shaky
piece<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.560> junk<00:00:32.149> put<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.180> guard<00:00:33.480> on<00:00:34.940> tola<00:00:35.940> cuz<00:00:36.210> I

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
piece of junk put a guard on tola cuz I

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.750 
piece of junk put a guard on tola cuz I
could<00:00:36.540> come<00:00:36.719> here<00:00:36.980> watch<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.250> generator<00:00:40.760> you

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
could come here watch the generator you

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.010 
could come here watch the generator you
did<00:00:42.090> men

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.750
