00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
at and then I just basically just have

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.550 
at and then I just basically just have
some<00:00:44.150> duplicates<00:00:44.690> in<00:00:44.780> the<00:00:44.870> boat<00:00:45.020> like<00:00:45.170> but<00:00:45.350> if

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:45.560 
some duplicates in the boat like but if

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.110 
some duplicates in the boat like but if
it's<00:00:45.740> a<00:00:45.829> crankbait<00:00:46.100> vital<00:00:46.550> for<00:00:46.790> crank<00:00:47.000> that

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
it's a crankbait vital for crank that

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:47.950 
it's a crankbait vital for crank that
your<00:00:47.240> odds<00:00:47.329> well<00:00:47.510> I'm<00:00:47.570> not<00:00:47.660> going<00:00:47.780> to<00:00:47.870> have

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960

your odds well I'm not going to have
four<00:00:48.620> crank<00:00:48.860> it<00:00:48.980> rods<00:00:49.160> out<00:00:49.280> right<00:00:49.460> now<00:00:49.610> to<00:00:49.670> show

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
four crank it rods out right now to show

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.240 
four crank it rods out right now to show
you<00:00:49.940> but<00:00:50.320> this<00:00:51.320> covers<00:00:51.530> all<00:00:51.770> the<00:00:51.890> techniques

that I use and so that's what I'm going

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.910 
that I use and so that's what I'm going
to<00:00:53.840> show<00:00:53.960> these<00:00:54.140> so<00:00:54.260> it<00:00:54.320> doesn't<00:00:54.530> take<00:00:54.650> so<00:00:54.800> long

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
to show these so it doesn't take so long

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.910 
to show these so it doesn't take so long
so<00:00:55.160> I'll<00:00:55.250> start<00:00:55.430> off<00:00:55.520> with<00:00:55.700> this<00:00:55.820> one<00:00:56.860> this<00:00:57.860> is

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
so I'll start off with this one this is

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
don't use it for lipless crank I use it

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.760 
don't use it for lipless crank I use it
for<00:02:14.700> top<00:02:14.970> waters<00:02:15.390> like<00:02:15.630> poppers<00:02:16.140> and<00:02:16.500> not

poppers and prop and prop baits because

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.850 
poppers and prop and prop baits because
I<00:02:20.700> have<00:02:20.820> 12<00:02:21.120> pound<00:02:21.420> or<00:02:21.840> sorry<00:02:22.080> at<00:02:22.170> 17<00:02:22.590> pound

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
I have 12 pound or sorry at 17 pound

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
monofilament with a loose feed spool and

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.310 
monofilament with a loose feed spool and
it's<00:02:26.370> just<00:02:26.520> it's<00:02:26.880> really<00:02:26.940> wimpy<00:02:27.420> rod<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.140> so

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
it's just it's really wimpy rod and so

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.260 
it's just it's really wimpy rod and so
that<00:02:28.470> way<00:02:28.590> I<00:02:28.620> use<00:02:28.830> it<00:02:28.860> for<00:02:29.190> poppers<00:02:30.120> because

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
that way I use it for poppers because

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.550 
that way I use it for poppers because
when<00:02:30.600> you<00:02:30.660> set<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.900> hook<00:02:30.960> then<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.380> hooks

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
when you set the hook then the hooks

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.260 
when you set the hook then the hooks
don't<00:02:31.680> get<00:02:31.830> ripped<00:02:32.010> out<00:02:32.160> of<00:02:32.190> its<00:02:32.310> mouth<00:02:32.550> so

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
don't get ripped out of its mouth so

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.510 
don't get ripped out of its mouth so
basically<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.750> top<00:02:33.930> water<00:02:34.110> rod<00:02:34.440> is<00:02:34.770> what<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.340> like

seven<00:04:35.620> foot<00:04:35.860> in<00:04:35.949> length<00:04:36.099> anymore<00:04:36.490> but<00:04:36.610> I<00:04:36.639> put

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:36.789 
seven foot in length anymore but I put

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:39.240 
seven foot in length anymore but I put
it<00:04:36.879> is<00:04:36.969> medium<00:04:37.389> so<00:04:37.629> when<00:04:38.530> you're<00:04:38.710> using<00:04:38.740> smooth

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
it is medium so when you're using smooth

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.170 
it is medium so when you're using smooth
base<00:04:39.400> that<00:04:39.550> need<00:04:39.699> walk<00:04:39.849> back<00:04:40.000> and<00:04:40.120> forth

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
base that need walk back and forth

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.429 
base that need walk back and forth
you're<00:04:40.479> going<00:04:40.629> to<00:04:40.689> want<00:04:40.810> to<00:04:40.870> use<00:04:40.960> braid<00:04:41.229> so<00:04:41.379> you

00:04:41.429 --> 00:04:41.439 
you're going to want to use braid so you

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:42.869 
you're going to want to use braid so you
can<00:04:41.590> get<00:04:41.680> the<00:04:41.770> best<00:04:41.889> action<00:04:42.129> out<00:04:42.400> of<00:04:42.430> the<00:04:42.550> out

00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:42.879 
can get the best action out of the out

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:45.480 
can get the best action out of the out
of<00:04:43.419> the<00:04:43.719> lure<00:04:43.900> and<00:04:44.199> win<00:04:44.830> it<00:04:44.949> with<00:04:45.189> it<00:04:45.310> being

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
of the lure and win it with it being

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.209 
of the lure and win it with it being
shorter<00:04:45.849> like<00:04:46.030> 610<00:04:46.479> versus<00:04:46.780> seven<00:04:47.020> foot<00:04:47.219> it's

00:04:48.209 --> 00:04:48.219 
shorter like 610 versus seven foot it's

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:49.529 
shorter like 610 versus seven foot it's
shorter<00:04:48.520> so<00:04:48.639> you're<00:04:48.759> right<00:04:48.909> isn't<00:04:49.180> into<00:04:49.330> water

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
shorter so you're right isn't into water

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:50.850 
shorter so you're right isn't into water
and<00:04:49.810> it's<00:04:49.990> a<00:04:50.050> little<00:04:50.229> stiffer<00:04:50.469> than<00:04:50.500> medium

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
and it's a little stiffer than medium

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.200 
and it's a little stiffer than medium
but<00:04:51.009> it's<00:04:51.099> not<00:04:51.250> quite<00:04:51.430> stiff<00:04:51.759> as<00:04:51.849> a<00:04:51.879> medium

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
but it's not quite stiff as a medium

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.610 
but it's not quite stiff as a medium
heavy<00:04:52.330> so<00:04:52.539> that's<00:04:52.689> kind<00:04:52.840> of<00:04:52.870> why<00:04:52.990> I<00:04:53.020> like<00:04:53.229> to

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
heavy so that's kind of why I like to

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.379 
heavy so that's kind of why I like to
keep<00:04:53.770> this<00:04:53.949> right<00:04:54.129> around<00:04:54.430> this<00:04:54.550> for<00:04:54.789> spooks

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
keep this right around this for spooks

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:58.140 
keep this right around this for spooks
and<00:04:55.599> top<00:04:55.750> water<00:04:55.990> base<00:04:56.199> such<00:04:56.919> as<00:04:56.949> that<00:04:57.340> this<00:04:58.000> one

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
and top water base such as that this one

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.659
