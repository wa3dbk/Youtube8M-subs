the blood sugar levels dropping in your

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.860 
the blood sugar levels dropping in your
body<00:01:48.980> so<00:01:49.610> choose<00:01:49.820> a<00:01:49.850> more<00:01:50.060> natural<00:01:50.540> sweetener

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.040 
even just a touch of honey if you need
that<00:01:54.710> so<00:01:55.159> choose<00:01:55.880> that<00:01:56.060> over<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:56.570> sugar<00:01:56.780> and

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
that so choose that over the sugar and

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.330 
that so choose that over the sugar and
go<00:01:57.380> for<00:01:57.530> green<00:01:57.620> tea<00:01:57.770> rather<00:01:57.950> than<00:01:58.100> coffee

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
go for green tea rather than coffee

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.790 
go for green tea rather than coffee
that's<00:01:59.240> the<00:01:59.360> first<00:01:59.540> thing<00:01:59.600> to<00:01:59.780> remember<00:01:59.900> the

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
that's the first thing to remember the

that's the first thing to remember the
second<00:02:01.220> thing<00:02:01.340> you<00:02:01.370> can<00:02:01.670> do<00:02:01.790> throughout<00:02:02.030> the

second thing you can do throughout the

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.850 
second thing you can do throughout the
day<00:02:02.210> is<00:02:02.479> it<00:02:02.540> practice<00:02:03.110> a<00:02:03.200> little<00:02:03.320> bit<00:02:03.500> of<00:02:03.650> deep

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
day is it practice a little bit of deep

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.070 
day is it practice a little bit of deep
breathing<00:02:04.190> a<00:02:04.550> lot<00:02:05.330> of<00:02:05.450> people<00:02:05.690> when<00:02:05.780> they<00:02:05.930> get

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
breathing a lot of people when they get

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.930 
breathing a lot of people when they get
in<00:02:06.229> very<00:02:06.380> stressful<00:02:06.800> situations<00:02:07.550> or<00:02:07.790> they're

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
in very stressful situations or they're

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.820 
in very stressful situations or they're
just<00:02:08.090> constantly<00:02:08.360> on<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:08.810> go<00:02:08.959> they<00:02:09.649> actually

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
just constantly on the go they actually

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.520 
just constantly on the go they actually
are<00:02:10.069> forgetting<00:02:10.609> to<00:02:10.759> breathe<00:02:11.120> deeply<00:02:11.629> and<00:02:11.959> all

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
are forgetting to breathe deeply and all

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.559 
are forgetting to breathe deeply and all
this<00:02:12.709> shallow<00:02:13.129> breathing<00:02:13.579> means<00:02:13.969> less<00:02:14.269> oxygen

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
this shallow breathing means less oxygen

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:15.290 
this shallow breathing means less oxygen
