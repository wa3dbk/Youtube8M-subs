platform really excited to be a part of
that<00:01:34.729> right<00:01:35.030> now<00:01:35.060> i<00:01:35.390> guess<00:01:35.690> it<00:01:35.810> was<00:01:35.960> just<00:01:35.990> a

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
that right now i guess it was just a

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.160 
that right now i guess it was just a
publisher<00:01:37.160> relationship<00:01:37.729> thing<00:01:37.940> that

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
publisher relationship thing that

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.480 
publisher relationship thing that
happened<00:01:39.170> that<00:01:39.649> we<00:01:39.800> were<00:01:39.920> working<00:01:40.100> on<00:01:40.310> that

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
happened that we were working on that

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.639 
happened that we were working on that
specific<00:01:40.910> platform<00:01:41.330> for<00:01:41.479> that<00:01:41.600> time<00:01:41.810> I<00:01:42.050> think

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
specific platform for that time I think

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:44.109

obviously without you be that we

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:45.999 
obviously without you be that we
couldn't<00:01:44.479> have<00:01:44.720> made<00:01:45.050> the<00:01:45.350> multi-platform

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
everything you saw in game they can

everything you saw in game they can
mimic<00:03:11.180> that<00:03:11.360> in<00:03:11.810> editor<00:03:12.530> if<00:03:12.709> they<00:03:12.920> just<00:03:13.130> have

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
mimic that in editor if they just have

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.009 
mimic that in editor if they just have
the<00:03:13.489> skill<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:14.060> challenges<00:03:14.540> that<00:03:14.570> we<00:03:14.840> have

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
the skill the challenges that we have

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.040 
the skill the challenges that we have
are<00:03:15.700> specific<00:03:16.700> to<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:17.120> tracks<00:03:17.390> that<00:03:17.630> we<00:03:17.810> have

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
are specific to the tracks that we have

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.350 
are specific to the tracks that we have
in<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:18.560> game<00:03:18.739> ourselves<00:03:19.430> so<00:03:20.000> what<00:03:20.239> you<00:03:20.330> have

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
in the game ourselves so what you have

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.470 
in the game ourselves so what you have
is<00:03:20.590> three<00:03:21.590> challenges<00:03:22.070> /<00:03:22.340> trials<00:03:22.700> track<00:03:22.940> and

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
is three challenges / trials track and

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.640 
is three challenges / trials track and
those<00:03:23.630> challenges<00:03:24.019> can<00:03:24.110> be<00:03:24.170> something<00:03:24.500> very

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
those challenges can be something very

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.410 
those challenges can be something very
simple<00:03:24.890> like<00:03:25.190> for<00:03:25.430> example<00:03:25.519> do<00:03:25.850> a<00:03:25.880> few<00:03:26.120> flips

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
simple like for example do a few flips

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.880 
simple like for example do a few flips
and<00:03:26.630> complete<00:03:26.959> the<00:03:27.079> track<00:03:27.290> or<00:03:27.500> they<00:03:27.739> can<00:03:27.860> be

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
and complete the track or they can be

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.199 
and complete the track or they can be
something<00:03:28.280> that<00:03:28.370> makes<00:03:28.489> you<00:03:28.610> think<00:03:28.820> about<00:03:28.970> the

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
something that makes you think about the

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.509 
something that makes you think about the
track<00:03:29.420> in<00:03:29.660> a<00:03:29.780> completely<00:03:30.170> different<00:03:30.290> way<00:03:30.709> for

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
track in a completely different way for

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.850 
track in a completely different way for
example<00:03:31.970> you<00:03:32.750> might<00:03:32.870> have<00:03:33.049> to<00:03:33.170> find<00:03:33.380> a<00:03:33.500> secret

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
example you might have to find a secret

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.380 
example you might have to find a secret
that's<00:03:33.980> within<00:03:34.250> that<00:03:34.489> that<00:03:34.850> level<00:03:35.150> and<00:03:35.239> that's

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
that's within that that level and that's

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.180 
that's within that that level and that's
something<00:03:35.750> that<00:03:35.900> trials<00:03:36.470> is<00:03:36.620> really<00:03:37.010> known

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
something that trials is really known

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.390 
something that trials is really known
for<00:03:37.220> as<00:03:37.700> well<00:03:37.940> as<00:03:38.209> secrets<00:03:38.780> and<00:03:38.989> I'm<00:03:39.920> I<00:03:40.220> can

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
for as well as secrets and I'm I can

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.860 
for as well as secrets and I'm I can
guarantee<00:03:40.700> that<00:03:40.820> there<00:03:41.150> are<00:03:41.329> going<00:03:41.630> to<00:03:41.690> be<00:03:41.780> a

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
guarantee that there are going to be a

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.539 
guarantee that there are going to be a
lot<00:03:42.170> of<00:03:42.200> interesting<00:03:42.769> things<00:03:43.010> going<00:03:43.130> on<00:03:43.370> in
