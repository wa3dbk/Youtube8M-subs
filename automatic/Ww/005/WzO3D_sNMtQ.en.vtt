00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.980 
art we squelch their dreams with a
bubble<00:01:37.770> test<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.399> so<00:01:38.969> we<00:01:39.209> did<00:01:39.389> it<00:01:39.539> we<00:01:39.719> lived

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
bubble test and so we did it we lived

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.949 
bubble test and so we did it we lived
through<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.469> and<00:01:40.649> it<00:01:41.429> was<00:01:41.670> ok<00:01:41.880> but<00:01:42.209> what<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.749> did

00:01:42.949 --> 00:01:42.959 
through it and it was ok but what it did

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:45.260 
through it and it was ok but what it did
is<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.259> sparked<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.859> little<00:01:44.069> motivation<00:01:44.700> with

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
is it sparked a little motivation with

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.010 
is it sparked a little motivation with
our<00:01:45.450> group<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:46.170> say<00:01:46.409> ok<00:01:47.450> assessment<00:01:48.450> we<00:01:48.689> get<00:01:48.899> it

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
our group to say ok assessment we get it

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.469 
our group to say ok assessment we get it
we<00:01:49.049> have<00:01:49.349> to<00:01:49.529> do<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.799> however<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:51.179> there<00:01:51.450> a

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
we have to do it however is there a

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.239 
we have to do it however is there a
better<00:01:51.749> way<00:01:51.929> is<00:01:52.439> there<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.709> better<00:01:52.859> assessment

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:53.249 
better way is there a better assessment

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:55.279 
better way is there a better assessment
is<00:01:53.579> there<00:01:53.729> more<00:01:53.880> performance-based<00:01:54.450> how<00:01:55.079> can

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
is there more performance-based how can

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:56.749 
is there more performance-based how can
we<00:01:55.409> really<00:01:55.679> assess<00:01:56.009> what<00:01:56.159> our<00:01:56.249> students<00:01:56.549> know

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
we really assess what our students know

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.309 
we really assess what our students know
and<00:01:56.789> are<00:01:56.999> able<00:01:57.029> to<00:01:57.359> do<00:01:57.450> because<00:01:57.569> the<00:01:57.959> problem

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
and are able to do because the problem

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:00.050 
and are able to do because the problem
with<00:01:58.439> this<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:59.279> answer<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.579> question<00:01:59.639> on

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
with this is you answer a question on

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.969 
with this is you answer a question on
symmetry<00:02:00.419> you<00:02:00.990> do<00:02:01.109> art<00:02:01.380> projects<00:02:01.829> with

cognitive demand and you pull that

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.619 
cognitive demand and you pull that
through<00:02:22.700> you're<00:02:23.120> going<00:02:23.239> to<00:02:23.300> have<00:02:23.420> skewed

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
through you're going to have skewed

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.690 
through you're going to have skewed
results<00:02:24.170> because<00:02:24.769> you're<00:02:24.950> high<00:02:25.129> flyers<00:02:25.489> are

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
results because you're high flyers are

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.680 
results because you're high flyers are
going<00:02:25.819> to<00:02:25.879> get<00:02:26.030> this<00:02:26.180> because<00:02:26.420> they<00:02:26.540> know

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
going to get this because they know

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.390 
going to get this because they know
their<00:02:26.840> vocabulary<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:27.739> that's<00:02:28.010> just<00:02:28.160> one

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
their vocabulary and that's just one

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.220 
their vocabulary and that's just one
aspect<00:02:28.580> of<00:02:28.910> what<00:02:29.030> we<00:02:29.060> do<00:02:29.239> but<00:02:29.660> your<00:02:29.840> students

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
aspect of what we do but your students

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.199 
aspect of what we do but your students
who<00:02:30.319> are<00:02:30.379> new<00:02:31.250> their<00:02:31.400> art<00:02:31.549> concepts<00:02:31.940> didn't

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
who are new their art concepts didn't

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.550 
who are new their art concepts didn't
get<00:02:32.299> a<00:02:32.330> chance<00:02:32.510> to<00:02:32.750> show<00:02:32.930> that<00:02:33.110> you<00:02:33.290> see<00:02:33.410> where

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
get a chance to show that you see where

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.890 
get a chance to show that you see where
I'm<00:02:33.620> going<00:02:33.860> with<00:02:33.890> it<00:02:34.040> and<00:02:34.310> so<00:02:34.970> we<00:02:35.420> did<00:02:35.629> a<00:02:35.660> bunch

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
I'm going with it and so we did a bunch

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.199 
I'm going with it and so we did a bunch
of<00:02:36.080> research<00:02:36.790> research<00:02:37.790> research<00:02:37.819> research

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
of research research research research

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.150 
of research research research research
to<00:02:38.750> come<00:02:38.870> up<00:02:38.989> with<00:02:39.110> a<00:02:39.140> better<00:02:39.319> artists<00:02:39.769> Essman

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
to come up with a better artists Essman

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.050 
to come up with a better artists Essman
and<00:02:40.400> so<00:02:41.030> what<00:02:41.420> I<00:02:41.450> did<00:02:41.810> let's<00:02:42.590> see<00:02:42.799> I'll<00:02:43.790> go<00:02:43.849> back

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
and so what I did let's see I'll go back

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.350 
and so what I did let's see I'll go back
on<00:02:44.269> here<00:02:44.510> what<00:02:45.440> I<00:02:45.470> did<00:02:45.769> was<00:02:45.980> I<00:02:46.190> created<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.819> 75

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
on here what I did was I created the 75

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.569 
on here what I did was I created the 75
page<00:02:47.599> PDF<00:02:47.870> of<00:02:48.410> like<00:02:48.680> better<00:02:49.010> other<00:02:49.310> art

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
assessments around the country what you

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.800 
assessments around the country what you
know<00:02:51.799> what<00:02:52.010> you<00:02:52.130> could<00:02:52.310> see<00:02:52.910> an<00:02:53.209> example<00:02:53.510> of<00:02:53.720> a

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
know what you could see an example of a

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.240 
know what you could see an example of a
performance-based<00:02:54.319> how<00:02:54.590> it<00:02:54.709> could<00:02:54.860> be<00:02:54.890> scored

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
performance-based how it could be scored

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.759 
performance-based how it could be scored
we<00:02:55.700> came<00:02:55.910> up<00:02:55.940> with<00:02:56.269> a<00:02:56.299> proactive<00:02:57.049> plan<00:02:57.410> of

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
we came up with a proactive plan of

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.589 
we came up with a proactive plan of
implementation<00:02:58.670> we'd<00:02:58.819> like<00:02:58.970> to<00:02:59.090> do<00:02:59.209> this<00:02:59.390> and

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
implementation we'd like to do this and

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.000 
implementation we'd like to do this and
here's<00:02:59.959> the<00:03:00.110> timeline<00:03:00.470> and<00:03:00.620> we'd<00:03:00.739> like<00:03:00.890> to

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
here's the timeline and we'd like to

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.410 
here's the timeline and we'd like to
recommend<00:03:01.459> this<00:03:01.519> and<00:03:01.819> we'd<00:03:01.910> like<00:03:02.060> to<00:03:02.180> start

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
recommend this and we'd like to start

with<00:03:06.470> my<00:03:06.590> 75<00:03:07.040> PDF<00:03:07.549> well<00:03:07.819> I<00:03:08.060> emailed<00:03:08.690> it<00:03:08.780> to<00:03:08.900> them

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
with my 75 PDF well I emailed it to them

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.449 
with my 75 PDF well I emailed it to them
all<00:03:09.140> ahead<00:03:09.319> of<00:03:09.440> time<00:03:09.590> and<00:03:09.799> it<00:03:09.980> crashed<00:03:10.250> their
