playing a defense that's my main worry
and<00:03:25.170> I<00:03:25.380> don't<00:03:25.500> have<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:25.709> worry<00:03:25.860> about<00:03:25.950> office

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
and I don't have to worry about office

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.920 
and I don't have to worry about office
because<00:03:26.640> I<00:03:26.730> got<00:03:26.910> every<00:03:27.180> single<00:03:27.329> play<00:03:27.660> that<00:03:27.900> I

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
because I got every single play that I

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.470 
because I got every single play that I
could<00:03:28.170> use<00:03:28.200> to<00:03:28.380> beat<00:03:29.280> man<00:03:29.519> and<00:03:29.820> zone<00:03:29.850> coverage

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
tight end option and we got the motion

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.310 
tight end option and we got the motion
right<00:03:38.100> here<00:03:38.400> play<00:03:38.670> to<00:03:38.730> beat<00:03:39.090> that<00:03:39.269> zone<00:03:39.540> and<00:03:39.810> we

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320
