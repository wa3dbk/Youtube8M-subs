these<00:02:55.519> guys<00:02:55.790> have<00:02:55.849> drafted<00:02:56.480> except<00:02:57.290> when<00:02:57.470> it

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
these guys have drafted except when it

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.500 
these guys have drafted except when it
comes<00:02:57.859> to<00:02:58.099> wide<00:02:58.280> receiver<00:02:58.310> it<00:02:59.000> seems<00:02:59.329> there's

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
comes to wide receiver it seems there's

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.500 
comes to wide receiver it seems there's
been<00:02:59.569> 16<00:03:00.319> wide<00:03:00.650> receivers<00:03:01.220> drafted<00:03:01.670> none<00:03:02.269> have

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
been 16 wide receivers drafted none have

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.569 
been 16 wide receivers drafted none have
really<00:03:03.079> hit<00:03:03.319> so<00:03:03.560> what<00:03:03.739> was<00:03:03.859> the<00:03:03.950> philosophy

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
really hit so what was the philosophy

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:07.330 
really hit so what was the philosophy
going<00:03:04.730> into<00:03:05.030> this<00:03:05.180> draft<00:03:05.680> well<00:03:06.680> we<00:03:06.890> wanted

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
going into this draft well we wanted

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.039 
going into this draft well we wanted
good<00:03:07.459> players<00:03:07.760> I<00:03:07.970> think<00:03:08.000> we<00:03:08.299> did<00:03:08.450> want<00:03:08.629> a<00:03:08.690> speed

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
good players I think we did want a speed

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.080 
good players I think we did want a speed
receiver<00:03:09.890> Susie<00:03:10.400> we<00:03:10.519> wanted<00:03:10.760> someone<00:03:11.000> that

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
receiver Susie we wanted someone that

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.550 
receiver Susie we wanted someone that
could<00:03:11.209> make<00:03:11.390> plays<00:03:11.629> downfield<00:03:12.200> and<00:03:12.319> I<00:03:12.410> think

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
could make plays downfield and I think

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.960 
could make plays downfield and I think
when<00:03:12.680> you<00:03:12.739> watch<00:03:12.859> Torrey<00:03:13.220> Smith<00:03:13.459> you<00:03:13.760> talk

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
when you watch Torrey Smith you talk

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.640 
when you watch Torrey Smith you talk
about<00:03:14.150> the<00:03:14.359> speed<00:03:14.629> first<00:03:14.900> obviously<00:03:15.410> he's

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
about the speed first obviously he's

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.250 
about the speed first obviously he's
also<00:03:15.829> big<00:03:16.250> he's<00:03:16.519> long<00:03:16.819> I<00:03:17.150> love<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:17.989> fact<00:03:18.200> that

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
also big he's long I love the fact that

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.990 
also big he's long I love the fact that
he<00:03:18.410> makes<00:03:18.680> plays<00:03:18.950> on<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:19.250> ball<00:03:19.400> downfield<00:03:19.669> but

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
he makes plays on the ball downfield but

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.610 
he makes plays on the ball downfield but
that's<00:03:20.150> not<00:03:20.299> all<00:03:20.450> there<00:03:20.569> is<00:03:20.660> to<00:03:20.780> him<00:03:20.959> he<00:03:21.410> can

that's not all there is to him he can

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.170 
that's not all there is to him he can
run<00:03:21.769> routes<00:03:22.040> he<00:03:22.250> can<00:03:22.370> get<00:03:22.489> out<00:03:22.609> of<00:03:22.730> break<00:03:22.940> so

top returners in the draft he's a
football<00:03:31.280> player<00:03:31.639> tan<00:03:32.540> and<00:03:32.660> Doss<00:03:32.810> we<00:03:33.049> just

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
football player tan and Doss we just

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.349 
football player tan and Doss we just
took<00:03:33.349> tan<00:03:33.590> and<00:03:33.739> Doss<00:03:33.919> who's<00:03:34.609> another<00:03:34.910> big

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
took tan and Doss who's another big

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:37.780 
took tan and Doss who's another big
tough<00:03:35.829> hard-nosed<00:03:36.829> receiver<00:03:37.190> great<00:03:37.519> hands

tough hard-nosed receiver great hands

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.940 
tough hard-nosed receiver great hands
maybe<00:03:38.480> the<00:03:38.660> best<00:03:38.870> run<00:03:39.139> after<00:03:39.349> ketch<00:03:39.560> receiver

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
maybe the best run after ketch receiver

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.379 
maybe the best run after ketch receiver
I<00:03:40.069> think<00:03:40.489> it's<00:03:40.609> terms<00:03:40.790> of<00:03:40.910> catching<00:03:41.180> the<00:03:41.239> ball

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
I think it's terms of catching the ball

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:43.390 
I think it's terms of catching the ball
and<00:03:41.419> getting<00:03:41.720> up<00:03:41.870> field<00:03:42.109> with<00:03:42.829> an<00:03:42.980> attitude

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
and getting up field with an attitude

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.819 
and getting up field with an attitude
that's<00:03:44.090> in<00:03:44.299> this<00:03:44.419> draft<00:03:44.690> right<00:03:44.900> now<00:03:45.079> so<00:03:45.709> we

Flacco<00:06:10.340> was<00:06:10.610> seeing<00:06:10.849> to<00:06:11.300> Bolden<00:06:11.870> inmates<00:06:12.260> leap

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:14.270 
will open up a little bit because you've

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.750 
will open up a little bit because you've
expanded<00:06:14.720> the<00:06:14.990> field<00:06:15.229> vertically<00:06:16.039> not<00:06:16.550> only

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:16.760 
expanded the field vertically not only

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.150 
expanded the field vertically not only
horizontally<00:06:17.450> so<00:06:17.780> Joe<00:06:18.260> Flacco's<00:06:18.770> got<00:06:18.950> to<00:06:19.070> be

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
horizontally so Joe Flacco's got to be

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.190

finally<00:06:20.120> happy<00:06:20.450> there's<00:06:20.720> getting<00:06:20.960> that<00:06:21.050> guy

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:21.200 
finally happy there's getting that guy

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.480 
finally happy there's getting that guy
who<00:06:21.260> can<00:06:21.470> heat<00:06:21.560> scroll<00:06:21.830> deep<00:06:22.070> down<00:06:22.280> the<00:06:22.460> field

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.490 
who can heat scroll deep down the field

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.640 
who can heat scroll deep down the field
and<00:06:22.820> get<00:06:23.180> those<00:06:23.300> explosive<00:06:23.930> plays<00:06:24.139> you<00:06:24.530> know<00:06:24.560> I

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.650 
and get those explosive plays you know I

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:25.600 
and get those explosive plays you know I
think<00:06:24.740> one<00:06:24.950> of<00:06:24.979> the<00:06:25.099> other<00:06:25.130> things<00:06:25.520> people

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:25.610 
think one of the other things people

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.820 
think one of the other things people
look<00:06:26.000> at<00:06:26.150> with<00:06:26.270> the<00:06:26.360> Ravens<00:06:26.750> is<00:06:26.960> there's<00:06:27.650> a<00:06:27.710> lot

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:27.830 
look at with the Ravens is there's a lot

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.230 
look at with the Ravens is there's a lot
of<00:06:27.950> talent<00:06:28.340> there<00:06:28.370> but<00:06:28.520> it's<00:06:28.849> getting<00:06:29.180> a

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.240 
of talent there but it's getting a

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.909 
of talent there but it's getting a
little<00:06:29.389> bit<00:06:29.599> older<00:06:30.229> yeah

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:30.919 
little bit older yeah

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:32.409 
little bit older yeah
that's<00:06:31.220> primarily<00:06:31.550> on<00:06:31.669> defense<00:06:32.120> so<00:06:32.240> I<00:06:32.330> think

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:32.419 
that's primarily on defense so I think

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:35.620 
that's primarily on defense so I think
offensively<00:06:33.380> all<00:06:33.710> right<00:06:33.890> exactly<00:06:34.190> exactly<00:06:34.940> to

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:35.630 
offensively all right exactly exactly to

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:36.280 
offensively all right exactly exactly to
my<00:06:35.780> point

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:36.290 
my point

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.290 
my point
that's<00:06:36.860> why<00:06:37.070> the<00:06:37.130> Ravenswood<00:06:37.820> their<00:06:37.970> first

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:38.300 
that's why the Ravenswood their first

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.810 
that's why the Ravenswood their first
overall<00:06:38.660> choice<00:06:39.050> went<00:06:39.440> with<00:06:39.620> Jimmy<00:06:39.980> Smith<00:06:40.250> the

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:40.820 
overall choice went with Jimmy Smith the

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.770 
overall choice went with Jimmy Smith the
dynamic<00:06:41.540> cornerback<00:06:42.020> from<00:06:42.200> Colorado
