can<00:02:57.290> see<00:02:57.500> it's<00:02:57.770> not<00:02:57.980> big<00:02:58.280> whatsoever<00:02:58.850> so<00:02:59.120> any

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
can see it's not big whatsoever so any

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.780

little movement you turn your head for

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.190

example<00:03:02.060> today<00:03:02.180> on<00:03:02.360> my<00:03:02.480> lunch<00:03:02.510> break<00:03:02.780> at<00:03:03.050> work

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
example today on my lunch break at work

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.880 
example today on my lunch break at work
i<00:03:03.410> was<00:03:03.530> eating<00:03:03.970> listening<00:03:04.970> to<00:03:05.060> these<00:03:05.180> and<00:03:05.890> they

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
i was eating listening to these and they

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.370 
i was eating listening to these and they
were<00:03:06.950> falling<00:03:07.340> off<00:03:07.700> because<00:03:08.150> of<00:03:08.180> my<00:03:08.540> jaw<00:03:09.020> I

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
were falling off because of my jaw I

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.650 
were falling off because of my jaw I
guess<00:03:09.800> movement<00:03:10.220> from<00:03:10.340> eating<00:03:10.700> that<00:03:11.510> is

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
guess movement from eating that is

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.000 
guess movement from eating that is
horrible<00:03:12.110> i<00:03:12.380> mean<00:03:13.300> yeah<00:03:14.590> they<00:03:15.590> can't<00:03:15.830> stay<00:03:15.980> on

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
horrible i mean yeah they can't stay on

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.010 
horrible i mean yeah they can't stay on
either<00:03:16.700> if<00:03:17.000> it's<00:03:17.180> not<00:03:17.300> this<00:03:17.570> weighing<00:03:17.870> them

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
either if it's not this weighing them

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.530 
either if it's not this weighing them
down<00:03:18.670> it's<00:03:19.670> the<00:03:19.880> fact<00:03:20.090> that<00:03:20.209> these<00:03:20.390> are

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
down it's the fact that these are

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.690 
down it's the fact that these are
extremely<00:03:21.170> small<00:03:21.680> so<00:03:22.040> there's<00:03:22.220> not<00:03:22.340> enough

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
extremely small so there's not enough

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.330 
extremely small so there's not enough
suction<00:03:23.540> or<00:03:23.810> and<00:03:23.959> not<00:03:24.140> insertion<00:03:25.010> into<00:03:25.160> your

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
suction or and not insertion into your

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.690 
suction or and not insertion into your
ear<00:03:25.520> will<00:03:25.730> stay<00:03:25.970> on<00:03:26.000> which<00:03:26.990> sucks<00:03:27.380> because

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
ear will stay on which sucks because

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.280 
ear will stay on which sucks because
