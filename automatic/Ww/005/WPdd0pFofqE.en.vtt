play<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.519> one<00:00:30.330> adjustment<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:30.990> like<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.199> do

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
play and one adjustment I like to do

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.610 
play and one adjustment I like to do
pre-snap<00:00:31.859> is<00:00:32.430> put<00:00:33.030> Y<00:00:33.300> in<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.840> slant<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.500> the

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
pre-snap is put Y in a slant to the

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.299 
pre-snap is put Y in a slant to the
right<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.760> after<00:00:35.910> that<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.620> snap<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.770> ball<00:00:37.980> and

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
right and after that I snap the ball and

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.450 
right and after that I snap the ball and
my<00:00:38.640> first<00:00:39.000> two<00:00:39.210> reads<00:00:39.480> are<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.440> on<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.160> drag

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
my first two reads are the a on the drag

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.720 
my first two reads are the a on the drag
route<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.059> y<00:00:42.270> on<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:43.320> slant<00:00:44.129> over<00:00:44.579> the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
route and the y on the slant over the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.790 
route and the y on the slant over the
middle<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.180> then<00:00:45.750> after<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.530> want<00:00:46.710> to

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
middle and then after that you want to

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.650 
middle and then after that you want to
look<00:00:46.980> at<00:00:47.190> X<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:48.200> B<00:00:49.579> you<00:00:50.579> can<00:00:50.730> hit<00:00:50.850> them<00:00:51.090> quickly

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
look at X and B you can hit them quickly

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.650 
look at X and B you can hit them quickly
on<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.230> side<00:00:52.530> on<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.219> flat<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:54.239> could<00:00:54.390> be<00:00:54.510> like

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
on the side on the flat it could be like

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.439 
on the side on the flat it could be like
a<00:00:54.690> 5-yard<00:00:55.260> gain<00:00:55.320> or<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.129> maybe<00:00:56.399> more<00:00:56.879> if<00:00:57.120> you

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
a 5-yard gain or so maybe more if you

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.029 
a 5-yard gain or so maybe more if you
have<00:00:57.600> some<00:00:57.870> speed<00:00:58.109> wide<00:00:58.350> receiver<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:58.980> you

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
have some speed wide receiver and you

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.340 
have some speed wide receiver and you
throw<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.399> just<00:00:59.550> right<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.210> other<00:01:00.989> than<00:01:01.109> that

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
throw it just right and other than that

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.110 
throw it just right and other than that
you're<00:01:01.680> going<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.859> want<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.190> look<00:01:02.399> for<00:01:02.760> them<00:01:02.879> on

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
you're going to want to look for them on

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.509 
you're going to want to look for them on
the<00:01:03.300> way<00:01:03.420> up<00:01:03.690> on<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.100> basically<00:01:05.100> it's<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.339> wheel

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
the way up on the basically it's a wheel

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.969 
the way up on the basically it's a wheel
around<00:01:05.670> I'm<00:01:06.000> not<00:01:06.030> it's<00:01:06.540> not<00:01:06.780> exactly<00:01:07.350> one<00:01:07.650> kind

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
around I'm not it's not exactly one kind

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.630 
around I'm not it's not exactly one kind
of<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:10.070> but<00:01:11.070> what<00:01:11.250> you're<00:01:11.340> going<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.520> want

of it is but what you're going to want

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.060 
of it is but what you're going to want
to<00:01:11.729> do<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:12.090> either<00:01:12.299> pass<00:01:12.689> lead<00:01:13.080> inside<00:01:13.650> on<00:01:13.950> the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
to do is either pass lead inside on the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.830 
to do is either pass lead inside on the
wheel<00:01:14.280> or<00:01:14.610> if<00:01:14.880> you're<00:01:15.000> going<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.360> get<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.630> zone

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
wheel or if you're going to get to zone

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.380 
wheel or if you're going to get to zone
defense<00:01:16.470> more<00:01:17.220> times<00:01:17.490> than<00:01:17.729> not<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:18.000> could

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
defense more times than not you could

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.749 
defense more times than not you could
see<00:01:18.570> them<00:01:18.810> just<00:01:19.110> wide<00:01:19.740> open<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:20.310> was<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.460> man

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
see them just wide open that was a man

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.600 
see them just wide open that was a man
coverage<00:01:21.299> where<00:01:21.600> if<00:01:22.040> you<00:01:23.040> know<00:01:23.159> they<00:01:23.340> make<00:01:23.580> a

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
coverage where if you know they make a

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.730 
coverage where if you know they make a
good<00:01:23.970> cut<00:01:24.299> where<00:01:24.750> they're<00:01:25.229> just<00:01:25.409> going<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.619> be

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
good cut where they're just going to be

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.310 
good cut where they're just going to be
open<00:01:26.159> so<00:01:26.880> you've<00:01:27.150> got<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.540> slants<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.200> the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
open so you've got the slants and the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.289 
open so you've got the slants and the
drag<00:01:28.619> over<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.009> middle<00:01:29.340> then<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:29.970> mix<00:01:30.180> that

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
drag over the middle then you mix that

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.990 
drag over the middle then you mix that
in<00:01:30.689> with<00:01:30.720> these<00:01:31.079> two<00:01:31.350> routes<00:01:31.650> on<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.159> ends<00:01:32.670> the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
in with these two routes on the ends the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.969 
in with these two routes on the ends the
X<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.479> beer<00:01:33.689> out<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.200> you've<00:01:34.799> got<00:01:34.920> a

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
X and the beer out and you've got a

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.819

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
maybe you could even end up hot routing

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.889 
maybe you could even end up hot routing
RB<00:01:44.640> if<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:44.970> want<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.240> have<00:01:45.360> them<00:01:45.479> do<00:01:45.630> something
