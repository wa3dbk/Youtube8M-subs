ended<00:00:30.860> up<00:00:30.950> here<00:00:31.190> where<00:00:31.460> I<00:00:31.520> am<00:00:31.640> today<00:00:31.699> because

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
ended up here where I am today because

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.790 
ended up here where I am today because
at<00:00:32.629> some<00:00:32.840> point<00:00:33.790> an<00:00:34.790> egg<00:00:35.210> cell<00:00:35.660> met<00:00:36.290> a<00:00:36.320> sperm

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
at some point an egg cell met a sperm

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.400 
at some point an egg cell met a sperm
cell<00:00:37.160> and<00:00:37.610> before<00:00:38.420> this<00:00:38.660> moment<00:00:38.930> I<00:00:39.290> was

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
cell and before this moment I was

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.220 
cell and before this moment I was
actually<00:00:39.680> in<00:00:40.129> two<00:00:40.610> separate<00:00:41.480> places<00:00:41.540> at<00:00:42.170> the

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
actually in two separate places at the

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.710 
actually in two separate places at the
same<00:00:42.980> exact<00:00:43.370> time<00:00:43.579> I<00:00:43.820> kind<00:00:44.210> of<00:00:44.270> was<00:00:44.450> living

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
same exact time I kind of was living

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.080 
same exact time I kind of was living
these<00:00:44.810> two<00:00:45.140> parallel<00:00:45.800> lives<00:00:46.070> in<00:00:46.520> two<00:00:46.730> separate

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
these two parallel lives in two separate

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.389 
these two parallel lives in two separate
places<00:00:47.149> and<00:00:47.780> then<00:00:48.410> the<00:00:48.530> sperm<00:00:48.800> met<00:00:49.070> the<00:00:49.250> egg

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
places and then the sperm met the egg

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.170 
places and then the sperm met the egg
and<00:00:50.180> I<00:00:50.809> guess<00:00:51.260> I<00:00:51.410> kind<00:00:51.620> of<00:00:51.680> became<00:00:51.890> one<00:00:52.430> the
