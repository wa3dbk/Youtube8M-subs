00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.030 
you can see it's maybe maybe a hair
longer<00:04:56.070> on<00:04:56.460> the<00:04:56.610> end<00:04:56.760> but<00:04:57.030> it's<00:04:57.150> narrower<00:04:57.540> and

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
longer on the end but it's narrower and

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.830 
longer on the end but it's narrower and
about<00:04:59.040> the<00:04:59.190> same<00:04:59.370> width<00:04:59.730> as<00:04:59.940> a<00:05:00.000> cell<00:05:00.330> phone<00:05:00.600> so

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
about the same width as a cell phone so

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.400 
about the same width as a cell phone so
it<00:05:00.960> easily<00:05:01.410> fit<00:05:02.100> in<00:05:02.250> your<00:05:02.400> pocket<00:05:02.640> I<00:05:03.410> think

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
it easily fit in your pocket I think

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.580 
it easily fit in your pocket I think
it's<00:05:04.620> around<00:05:04.920> 4<00:05:05.730> inches<00:05:06.170> yeah<00:05:07.170> it's<00:05:07.350> four

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
it's around 4 inches yeah it's four

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.760 
it's around 4 inches yeah it's four
inches<00:05:07.920> long<00:05:08.930> about<00:05:09.930> two<00:05:10.260> inches<00:05:10.680> wide<00:05:11.070> and

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
inches long about two inches wide and

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.220 
inches long about two inches wide and
above<00:05:13.770> three<00:05:14.730> eighths<00:05:14.970> of<00:05:15.180> an<00:05:15.300> inch<00:05:15.420> thick<00:05:15.900> so

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
above three eighths of an inch thick so

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.680 
above three eighths of an inch thick so
it's<00:05:16.440> thinner<00:05:17.130> than<00:05:17.430> a<00:05:17.610> cell<00:05:18.180> phone<00:05:18.450> would<00:05:18.660> be

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
it's thinner than a cell phone would be

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.810 
it's thinner than a cell phone would be
as<00:05:19.440> you<00:05:19.560> can<00:05:19.740> see<00:05:19.920> that<00:05:20.130> would<00:05:20.250> easily<00:05:20.430> be

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
as you can see that would easily be

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.950 
as you can see that would easily be
portable<00:05:21.740> how<00:05:22.740> this<00:05:23.010> works<00:05:23.310> is<00:05:23.610> you<00:05:24.570> get<00:05:24.750> your

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
portable how this works is you get your

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.610 
portable how this works is you get your
cable<00:05:25.850> that<00:05:26.850> comes<00:05:27.000> with<00:05:27.270> it<00:05:27.300> your<00:05:27.600> USB<00:05:28.110> type<00:05:28.380> 1

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
cable that comes with it your USB type 1

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.040 
cable that comes with it your USB type 1
now<00:05:29.490> if<00:05:29.700> you<00:05:29.850> were<00:05:29.970> going<00:05:30.300> to<00:05:30.330> plug<00:05:30.750> it<00:05:30.900> into

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
now if you were going to plug it into

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.380 
now if you were going to plug it into
your<00:05:31.140> computer<00:05:31.260> for<00:05:32.010> the<00:05:32.160> quick<00:05:32.400> charge<00:05:32.730> you

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390 
your computer for the quick charge you

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.980 
your computer for the quick charge you
would<00:05:33.540> plug<00:05:33.720> your<00:05:33.930> USB<00:05:33.990> connector<00:05:34.950> into<00:05:35.130> it<00:05:35.430> on

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
would plug your USB connector into it on

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.570 
would plug your USB connector into it on
the<00:05:36.990> end<00:05:37.140> of<00:05:37.320> the<00:05:37.410> unit<00:05:37.740> itself<00:05:37.860> you'll<00:05:38.370> see<00:05:38.550> a

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
the end of the unit itself you'll see a

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.630 
the end of the unit itself you'll see a
USB<00:05:39.210> connector<00:05:39.860> which<00:05:40.860> can<00:05:41.070> be<00:05:41.160> used<00:05:41.310> as<00:05:41.430> your

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
USB connector which can be used as your

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.550 
USB connector which can be used as your
output<00:05:42.030> to<00:05:42.180> charge<00:05:42.450> your<00:05:42.630> devices<00:05:42.990> run<00:05:43.410> your

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
output to charge your devices run your

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.370 
output to charge your devices run your
devices<00:05:44.040> and<00:05:44.220> also<00:05:44.820> I<00:05:45.060> input<00:05:45.390> connector<00:05:46.110> very

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
devices and also I input connector very

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.890 
devices and also I input connector very
similar<00:05:46.890> to<00:05:46.920> what<00:05:47.160> you<00:05:47.250> would<00:05:47.280> find<00:05:47.430> on<00:05:47.880> a<00:05:47.940> cell

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
similar to what you would find on a cell

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.150 
similar to what you would find on a cell
phone<00:05:49.970> I'll<00:05:50.970> see<00:05:51.180> if<00:05:51.300> I<00:05:51.420> can<00:05:51.600> find<00:05:51.840> the

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 
phone I'll see if I can find the

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.480 
phone I'll see if I can find the
appropriate<00:05:53.160> connector<00:05:54.150> here<00:05:55.160> so<00:05:56.160> what<00:05:56.370> we

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
appropriate connector here so what we

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.250 
appropriate connector here so what we
would<00:05:56.670> do<00:05:56.850> is<00:05:57.090> just<00:05:57.300> plug<00:05:57.570> it<00:05:57.720> in<00:05:57.870> like<00:05:58.140> you

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
would do is just plug it in like you

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.940 
would do is just plug it in like you
were<00:05:58.410> plugging<00:05:58.800> in<00:05:59.040> your<00:05:59.330> cell<00:06:00.330> phone<00:06:00.950> then

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:01.950 
were plugging in your cell phone then

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.120 
were plugging in your cell phone then
the<00:06:02.100> adapter<00:06:03.050> just<00:06:04.050> sticks<00:06:04.290> on<00:06:04.500> to<00:06:04.650> that<00:06:04.830> now

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130 
the adapter just sticks on to that now

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.900 
the adapter just sticks on to that now
we<00:06:05.190> can<00:06:05.430> plug<00:06:05.670> this<00:06:05.880> into<00:06:06.180> our<00:06:06.830> computer<00:06:07.910> let

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:08.910 
we can plug this into our computer let

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.850 
we can plug this into our computer let
that<00:06:09.090> charge<00:06:09.450> for<00:06:09.720> three<00:06:09.930> or<00:06:10.020> four<00:06:10.080> hours<00:06:10.260> get

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
that charge for three or four hours get

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.520 
that charge for three or four hours get
it<00:06:10.980> fully<00:06:11.190> charged<00:06:11.700> now<00:06:11.970> if<00:06:12.810> I<00:06:12.900> wanted<00:06:13.200> to<00:06:13.320> use

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.530 
it fully charged now if I wanted to use

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:18.560 
it fully charged now if I wanted to use
that<00:06:13.890> to<00:06:14.220> add<00:06:14.970> some<00:06:15.540> time<00:06:15.870> to<00:06:16.230> my<00:06:17.330> cell<00:06:18.330> phone

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:18.570 
that to add some time to my cell phone

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.750 
that to add some time to my cell phone
itself<00:06:18.960> if<00:06:19.260> my<00:06:19.410> battery<00:06:19.830> was<00:06:20.010> getting<00:06:20.310> weak<00:06:20.490> I

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:20.760 
itself if my battery was getting weak I

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.810 
itself if my battery was getting weak I
can<00:06:21.270> just<00:06:21.390> pull<00:06:21.600> the<00:06:21.720> plug<00:06:21.960> out<00:06:22.520> plug<00:06:23.520> the<00:06:23.670> USB

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:23.820 
can just pull the plug out plug the USB

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.610 
can just pull the plug out plug the USB
end<00:06:24.420> into<00:06:24.600> the<00:06:25.320> charger<00:06:25.740> itself<00:06:26.310> and

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
end into the charger itself and

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.740 
end into the charger itself and
fortunately<00:06:28.620> for<00:06:29.130> me<00:06:29.160> it<00:06:29.610> is<00:06:30.270> actually<00:06:30.630> the

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:30.750 
fortunately for me it is actually the

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.970 
fortunately for me it is actually the
same<00:06:30.960> connector<00:06:31.470> that<00:06:32.190> the<00:06:32.490> solar<00:06:33.030> power<00:06:33.330> uses

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:33.980 
same connector that the solar power uses

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.560 
same connector that the solar power uses
so<00:06:34.980> I<00:06:35.040> don't<00:06:35.190> even<00:06:35.400> have<00:06:35.580> to<00:06:35.760> switch<00:06:36.000> adapters

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:36.570 
so I don't even have to switch adapters

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.350 
so I don't even have to switch adapters
I<00:06:36.810> just<00:06:37.740> simply<00:06:37.890> plug<00:06:38.280> it<00:06:38.400> into<00:06:38.550> my<00:06:38.670> phone<00:06:39.030> like

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 
I just simply plug it into my phone like

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.410 
I just simply plug it into my phone like
that<00:06:39.630> and<00:06:39.930> now<00:06:40.500> I<00:06:40.530> can<00:06:40.860> use<00:06:41.040> that<00:06:41.250> to<00:06:41.310> charge<00:06:42.150> my

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:42.420 
that and now I can use that to charge my

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.320 
that and now I can use that to charge my
phone<00:06:42.630> up<00:06:42.900> add<00:06:43.500> a<00:06:43.530> couple<00:06:43.830> of<00:06:44.010> hours<00:06:44.340> more<00:06:44.610> talk
