waste<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.730> spectacle<00:00:12.480> on<00:00:12.660> this<00:00:12.929> I've<00:00:13.259> opened

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
waste the spectacle on this I've opened

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.550 
waste the spectacle on this I've opened
this<00:00:14.309> already<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:15.089> I<00:00:15.839> looked<00:00:16.020> at<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.170> couple<00:00:16.379> of

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
this already and I looked at a couple of

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.050 
this already and I looked at a couple of
the<00:00:16.680> packages<00:00:17.190> just<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.490> make<00:00:17.640> sure<00:00:17.670> it<00:00:17.880> was

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
the packages just to make sure it was

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.540 
the packages just to make sure it was
what<00:00:18.270> I<00:00:18.300> thought<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.570> was<00:00:18.779> that<00:00:19.050> is<00:00:19.260> the

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
what I thought it was that is the

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.029 
what I thought it was that is the
packaging<00:00:20.550> sleeve<00:00:21.230> that<00:00:22.230> has<00:00:22.500> been<00:00:22.680> destroyed

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
packaging sleeve that has been destroyed

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.490 
packaging sleeve that has been destroyed
in<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.310> rain<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:24.140> what<00:00:25.140> I'm<00:00:25.230> going<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.380> do

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
in the rain and what I'm going to do

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.150 
in the rain and what I'm going to do
this<00:00:25.710> time<00:00:25.980> if<00:00:26.400> you<00:00:26.640> did<00:00:26.820> not<00:00:26.849> see<00:00:27.210> my<00:00:27.359> previous

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
this time if you did not see my previous

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.680 
this time if you did not see my previous
thingy<00:00:29.160> video<00:00:30.439> it's<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.619> crap<00:00:31.890> ton<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:32.189> hollows

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:32.690 
thingy video it's a crap ton of hollows

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.900 
thingy video it's a crap ton of hollows
this<00:00:33.690> one<00:00:33.899> actually<00:00:34.110> came<00:00:34.710> undone<00:00:35.219> that's

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
this one actually came undone that's

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.220 
this one actually came undone that's
kind<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.450> interesting<00:00:37.969> anyways<00:00:39.140> in<00:00:40.140> the

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
kind of interesting anyways in the

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.330 
kind of interesting anyways in the
previous<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.829> have<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.070> thingy<00:00:41.370> video<00:00:42.360> I<00:00:42.690> had

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
previous I have a thingy video I had

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.860 
previous I have a thingy video I had
fourth<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.550> fifth<00:00:44.730> generation<00:00:45.149> holographic

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
fourth and fifth generation holographic

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.900 
fourth and fifth generation holographic
cards<00:00:46.200> yeah<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.280> looks<00:00:47.460> like<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.730> probably

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
cards yeah that looks like you probably

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.240 
cards yeah that looks like you probably
ran<00:00:48.329> out<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.480> bags<00:00:48.840> this<00:00:49.230> time<00:00:49.289> because<00:00:49.860> I've

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
ran out of bags this time because I've

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.750 
ran out of bags this time because I've
got<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.550> lot<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:50.879> stuff<00:00:51.180> wrapped<00:00:51.390> in<00:00:51.570> bubble

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
got a lot of stuff wrapped in bubble

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.420 
got a lot of stuff wrapped in bubble
some<00:00:53.989> we're<00:00:54.989> gonna<00:00:55.219> cautiously<00:00:56.219> and

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
some we're gonna cautiously and

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.069 
some we're gonna cautiously and
carefully<00:00:56.489> go<00:00:57.030> through<00:00:57.270> all<00:00:57.360> this<00:00:57.690> and<00:01:00.079> this

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
carefully go through all this and this

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.709 
carefully go through all this and this
time<00:01:01.379> i<00:01:01.649> had<00:01:01.770> 4th<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.250> 5th<00:01:02.730> gen<00:01:03.000> but<00:01:03.149> also<00:01:03.329> some

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
time i had 4th and 5th gen but also some

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.420 
time i had 4th and 5th gen but also some
third<00:01:04.140> generation<00:01:04.769> hollows<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.339> we're

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
third generation hollows that we're

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.179 
third generation hollows that we're
going<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.580> be<00:01:05.700> able<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:06.439> take<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.470> look<00:01:07.710> at<00:01:07.770> take

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
going to be able to take a look at take

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.109 
going to be able to take a look at take
a<00:01:08.250> peek<00:01:08.460> at<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.880> check<00:01:09.180> out<00:01:09.390> oh<00:01:09.420> my<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:11.119> just

a peek at and check out oh my I just

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.060 
a peek at and check out oh my I just
spotted<00:01:12.360> something<00:01:12.689> in<00:01:12.869> here<00:01:13.110> there's<00:01:13.979> more

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
spotted something in here there's more

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.310 
spotted something in here there's more
and<00:01:16.610> this<00:01:17.610> one's<00:01:17.850> not<00:01:18.030> going<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.240> be<00:01:18.330> as<00:01:18.479> weel<00:01:19.049> d

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
and this one's not going to be as weel d

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.570 
and this one's not going to be as weel d
as<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.710> other<00:01:19.860> one<00:01:20.100> but<00:01:20.430> i<00:01:21.830> have<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.860> fudge<00:01:23.250> load

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
as the other one but i have a fudge load

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.719

purchase total and what I'm going to do
is<00:01:59.299> slowly<00:02:00.299> integrate<00:02:00.810> them<00:02:01.170> oh<00:02:01.759> there's<00:02:02.759> a

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
is slowly integrate them oh there's a

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.499 
is slowly integrate them oh there's a

actually<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.310> think<00:02:14.430> we're<00:02:14.700> going<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:14.879> need<00:02:14.939> to

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
actually I think we're going to need to

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.949 
actually I think we're going to need to
go<00:02:16.189> into<00:02:17.189> the<00:02:17.700> box<00:02:17.939> to<00:02:18.150> show<00:02:18.329> you<00:02:18.390> that<00:02:18.750> I've

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
go into the box to show you that I've

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:25.490 
go into the box to show you that I've
got<00:02:19.170> another<00:02:19.489> what<00:02:20.489> is<00:02:20.640> that<00:02:20.790> five<00:02:21.359> hundred<00:02:24.500> or

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
got another what is that five hundred or

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.059 
got another what is that five hundred or
so<00:02:25.560> cards<00:02:26.280> in<00:02:26.400> here<00:02:28.220> black<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.400> white<00:02:29.430> series

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
so cards in here black and white series

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.250 
so cards in here black and white series
that<00:02:32.069> is<00:02:32.340> probably<00:02:32.819> going<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.180> take<00:02:33.329> some<00:02:33.629> some

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
that is probably going to take some some

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.559 
that is probably going to take some some
significant<00:02:34.859> sorting<00:02:35.220> it's<00:02:36.090> probably<00:02:36.269> going

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
significant sorting it's probably going

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.910 
significant sorting it's probably going
to<00:02:36.629> be<00:02:36.720> something<00:02:36.930> that<00:02:37.049> starts<00:02:37.409> now<00:02:37.590> but

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
to be something that starts now but

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.599 
to be something that starts now but
