since<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:31.410> only<00:00:31.590> have<00:00:31.770> a<00:00:31.800> tiny<00:00:32.039> stick<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.699> mix

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:32.879 
since I only have a tiny stick to mix

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:34.310 
since I only have a tiny stick to mix
with<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.510> I'm<00:00:33.629> gonna<00:00:33.780> try<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:33.930> get<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.140> butter

all of them all right I'm gonna say it's
incorporated<00:00:48.149> first<00:00:49.110> heat<00:00:49.320> source<00:00:49.530> Bunsen

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
incorporated first heat source Bunsen

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.310 
incorporated first heat source Bunsen
burner<00:00:50.670> I've<00:00:51.329> chosen<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.780> use<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.930> petri<00:00:52.170> dish

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
burner I've chosen to use a petri dish

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.430 
burner I've chosen to use a petri dish
because<00:00:53.190> it's<00:00:53.480> got<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.510> lid<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:54.960> can<00:00:55.170> taint

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
because it's got a lid so I can taint

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.680 
because it's got a lid so I can taint
heat<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:55.950> it's<00:00:56.520> gonna<00:00:56.610> be<00:00:56.760> easy<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.090> flip<00:00:57.360> and

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
heat and it's gonna be easy to flip and

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.940 
heat and it's gonna be easy to flip and
if<00:00:57.809> this<00:00:57.930> works<00:00:58.140> how<00:00:58.290> cute<00:00:58.620> will<00:00:58.829> these

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:58.950 
if this works how cute will these

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.130 
if this works how cute will these
pancakes<00:00:59.280> be<00:01:00.890> fun<00:01:01.969> the<00:01:02.969> Bunsen<00:01:03.600> burner<00:01:03.840> has

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
pancakes be fun the Bunsen burner has

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.350 
pancakes be fun the Bunsen burner has
direct<00:01:04.680> heat<00:01:04.949> unlike<00:01:05.549> an<00:01:05.700> oven<00:01:06.119> which<00:01:06.329> has

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
direct heat unlike an oven which has

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.330 
direct heat unlike an oven which has
surrounding<00:01:07.110> heat<00:01:07.320> which<00:01:07.829> is<00:01:07.950> really<00:01:08.190> what

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
surrounding heat which is really what

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.070 
surrounding heat which is really what
I'm<00:01:08.430> looking<00:01:08.490> for<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.150> order<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.390> make<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.750> cake

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
I'm looking for in order to make a cake

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.420 
I'm looking for in order to make a cake
oh<00:01:10.320> okay

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
oh okay

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.750 
oh okay
so<00:01:11.580> as<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:12.710> immediately<00:01:13.710> feared<00:01:14.010> it's<00:01:14.520> already

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
so as I immediately feared it's already

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.950 
so as I immediately feared it's already
started<00:01:15.030> burning<00:01:15.299> on<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.420> bottom<00:01:15.690> it's<00:01:15.810> got<00:01:15.900> a

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
started burning on the bottom it's got a

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.710 
started burning on the bottom it's got a
hot<00:01:16.170> spot<00:01:16.350> it's<00:01:17.040> not<00:01:17.310> gonna<00:01:17.790> cook<00:01:18.060> even<00:01:18.659> a

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
hot spot it's not gonna cook even a

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.170 
hot spot it's not gonna cook even a
little<00:01:18.840> bit<00:01:19.020> evenly<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:20.130> Bunsen<00:01:20.850> burner<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.119> a

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
little bit evenly so Bunsen burner is a

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.859 
little bit evenly so Bunsen burner is a
terrible<00:01:21.510> idea

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
terrible idea

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.890 
terrible idea
my<00:01:22.710> next<00:01:23.040> best<00:01:23.250> bet<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.700> how<00:01:23.820> only<00:01:24.119> other<00:01:24.600> heat

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
my next best bet and how only other heat

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.899 
my next best bet and how only other heat
source<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.560> hot<00:01:25.799> plate<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.250> have<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.549> lot<00:01:26.729> to

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
source is this hot plate I have a lot to

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.750 
source is this hot plate I have a lot to
experiment<00:01:27.540> with<00:01:27.689> ah<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.650> now<00:01:29.369> we<00:01:29.430> hope<00:01:29.640> for

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
experiment with ah and now we hope for

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.719 
experiment with ah and now we hope for
the<00:01:29.850> best<00:01:30.619> okay<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:31.799> it's<00:01:32.010> been<00:01:32.070> about<00:01:32.159> five

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
the best okay so it's been about five

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:33.380 
the best okay so it's been about five
minutes

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
minutes

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.810 
minutes
I<00:01:33.420> hear<00:01:34.200> sizzling<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:34.890> smell<00:01:35.280> butter<00:01:35.520> so

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
I hear sizzling and I smell butter so

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
I hear sizzling and I smell butter so
I'm<00:01:35.909> gonna<00:01:36.049> flip<00:01:37.049> this<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:38.090> bottom<00:01:39.090> is<00:01:39.270> cooked

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
I'm gonna flip this the bottom is cooked

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.630 
I'm gonna flip this the bottom is cooked
hopefully<00:01:40.350> it'll<00:01:40.439> do<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.680> same<00:01:40.830> thing<00:01:41.040> on<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
hopefully it'll do the same thing on the

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.760 
hopefully it'll do the same thing on the
other<00:01:41.670> side<00:01:41.850> because<00:01:42.420> it's<00:01:42.689> science<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.380> it

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
other side because it's science and it

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.550 
other side because it's science and it
does<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.479> okay<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:45.540> it's<00:01:45.780> been<00:01:45.840> about<00:01:45.960> five

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
does that okay so it's been about five

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.380 
does that okay so it's been about five
minutes<00:01:46.799> on<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.159> side<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.729> about<00:01:48.150> ten

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
minutes on this side so about ten

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.980 
minutes on this side so about ten
minutes<00:01:48.479> total

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
minutes total

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.149 
minutes total
