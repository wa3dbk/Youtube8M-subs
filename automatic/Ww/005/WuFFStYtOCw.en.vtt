00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:16.080
 moin moin for a short tour in which I the 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.000
 number 12.1 as admit it from the 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.230
 tutorial 12 derives or 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.670
 the question based on the tutorial 12 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.669
 I was approached 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.240
 we remember tutorial 12 build one 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:29.240
 traffic light circuit 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.430
 and as you can see this main bread 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.230
 this side street on green 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.850
 that means we have to go to the top now 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.850
 circuit put the car in 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.690
 and now the speed 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.730
 Depending on how fast the traffic light phases 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.320
 to turn on 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.580
 that is about seven o'clock in 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.580
 the size is enough 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.199
 and if we did everything right now 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.550
 then have the traffic lights too 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.550
 exceed the see here 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.210
 The road builders crossing construction always 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.770
 which is not a serious thing 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.900
 should only be on solid radiology 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.850
 establish 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:21.330
 that means you would rather poppy curves 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.880
 or rather built that way with you 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.820
 the 5 with the state highway five from the 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.310
 Trend shop for one euro I live day 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.190
 asked for the three but that makes 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.840
 Now, first, no big difference 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.920
 I need the whole thing with wm walk 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.620
 so that you once distinguished this 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.090
 can be 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.510
 So we catch yours somewhere 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.530
 street 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.010
 and here is now a t-junction 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.729
 For example, we could try 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.740
 now 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.600
 we start what we have to do 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.799
 This street is superior here now 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.870
 a main road or a side street 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:02.750
 that is 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:06.050
 22 is the mouth of the road 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.580
 lower priority, so to speak that is it 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.470
 a side street is here you come 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.930
 a handshake can then of course 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.630
 not that means we have to be in the 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.790
 it may be superior to the field 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.080
 a main street in one, so to speak 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.320
 other main roads then flows 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.130
 riders mark or without it 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:27.800
 survive first, and all 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.840
 next the turn off 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.000
 that means the poor, I'll say that 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.650
 soft wings 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.080
 Here we start with the walkway on the left 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.650
 without a center line are on a crossroads 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.060
 rarely drawn with lines that only in 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.710
 the either main thoroughfare 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.570
 or even very big crossings are 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.160
 also the bending traces painted 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.710
 that now in such a small tick 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.660
 of course not the case 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.610
 So we take the left is a track 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.910
 The docked with a right click 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.110
 we come in our context menu and 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.610
 Now we have to decide 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.240
 we are rather narrow curves or curvy 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.280
 curves 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.980
 that means a house in a corner 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.510
 stand or do not want in doubt 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.920
 build a state there is a house one 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.240
 Corner that means we have the small ones 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.470
 take radius 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.740
 that is, we are here in the long run 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:20.330
 nine meters 1 with an angle of 90 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:22.540
 grad only short and the soft right 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.540
 rum 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.870
 Incidentally, the number of degrees here have the same 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.310
 that means nine meters 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.210
 is also the smallest length for the 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.100
 angle 90 degrees 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.830
 so it always pays off in the 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:39.130
 ten times that is at 5 meters 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.810
 I also 50 degrees at 13 5 meters 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.520
 I come to 135 degrees 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:47.280
 that's how it pays off 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:52.190
 Of course, not 360 ° goes clear 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.840
 but you rarely need it that way 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.850
 of course, this must be the next one 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.350
 soft wings that means we change 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:04.580
 up here on the normal walkway 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:05.690
 that is docked here now you can 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.520
 I think about it in a long time 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.940
 usually with ten meters 15 meters goes 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:13.640
 even then the car flashes earlier 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.530
 rich furthermore, is hidden now but 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.930
 the soft for upside down there is one 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.450
 easy trick the road will be once 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.820
 on it the other one takes and makes 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.540
 then it just becomes that three clients 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:27.270
 docked then turns the whole 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.220
 Time to show that again 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.570
 we hope that here 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.920
 So that's because I just talk 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.190
 and the other end becomes the other 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.920
 a docked we can do this now 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:41.370
 Remove again with the remove button 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:43.620
 and then this is really rum next 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:47.070
 part he is turning right turn off 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:50.570
 lying part of the street there we take 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.610
 right this time right walkway without line 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.740
 it will be docked here again 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.580
 context menu go 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.720
 and now we do not want to go to the left 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:03.560
 and to the right that is minus 90 degrees 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:06.020
 then the street is different 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:10.160
 the best as well as the same again 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.120
 walkway rich a softer 15 meter 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.919
 hide lanterns 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:18.520
 the displays turn turn away with it 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:20.949
 it will be 100 pieces for us 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.539
 of course we have to think of it now 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:24.550
 now a continuous main street 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:28.180
 or maybe even meet three here 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:30.729
 main roads on normal case is this 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.940
 the main thoroughfare that is 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:36.280
 taken the midday right 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.919
 planned then we can up here us 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.310
 take the point and that was here with it 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:42.860
 shut down 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.300
 in 3d then it looks like that now 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.440
 a bit comes avoid you though 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.730
 the easy turning road 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.610
 that means only eight 

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:52.550
 centimeter height for example or the 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.890
 drove another height 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.120
 what you could come up with would be complete 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:59.270
 without marking the the crossing 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.760
 complete without marking does that but 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.380
 Of course now we see something nice here 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.250
 I said earlier with the angular curves 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.020
 or round curves 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:10.850
 we see now we have a nice one 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:12.980
 90 ° corner where a house prima comes in the 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:15.740
 Of course you can also get down a bit 

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:18.980
 that means in a quick run that 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.300
 same procedures as just just 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:23.740
 that we are not new tenants this time 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.740
 take but about 15 meters 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:33.319
 and then we will see the whole 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:35.580
 curve something round what are you doing here 

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:39.580
 practically a park for example when 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:41.289
 I have a fence or other stuff 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.479
 we have two different crossing 

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:48.969
 So once the inner city 

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:52.180
 I say something more extensive 

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:54.009
 people with the t crossing go that 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.120
 of course with the big crossroads 

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:58.659
 That means four roads 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:00.879
 of course, the procedure just as well 

00:06:58.659 --> 00:07:04.870
 that of course, then a 3 hehe 

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:05.979
 made and mostly on the 

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:08.650
 cross-over region with no 

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:11.590
 Medium mark is what I'm ever two 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:12.909
 home street tick so many thanks for 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:14.800
 the attention at the short ones 

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:17.099
 tutorial and i hope i could 

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.099
 continue
