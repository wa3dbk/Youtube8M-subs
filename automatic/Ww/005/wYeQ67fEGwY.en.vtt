00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.199
 and good hello to all and all 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.299
 friends here what game bout a new 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:19.180
 video and we end up today for 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.550
 my very first tutorial on how 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.750
 install the sony gas shader in 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.470
 bolivia good challenge 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:29.410
 so here to begin with you just need 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.449
 to download that we will delete 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.239
 and that too because it's a bit more 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.519
 far in the facility of 100 m I 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.079
 have just failed my installation 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:39.519
 I shot the video but that paris 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.000
 body of my microphone is not serious 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:42.040
 do not care 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.799
 so all you need is 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.330
 download these four folders that are 

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:48.489
 in the description of the video as well 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.589
 that archiver winrar who was also 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.360
 in the description of the video you 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:54.489
 install weir archiver and you help me 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.799
 these four files in a folder that 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.059
 you create anywhere or on your 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:58.890
 office as you feel a weight I 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:03.369
 I do not care 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.650
 then you create one for minecraft 9 

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:06.759
 if possible so that they have no 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.290
 problem and you're sure it 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:09.460
 market 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.960
 then you have in your bar of 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:16.240
 search windows at the bottom left you 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:19.300
 type% to data percent between and you 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.720
 get to the huanming folder with 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.190
 your paragraph you're waddling and 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.070
 there you have minecraft this is the 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.620
 dummy point I admit doing right click 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.820
 open with archiver winrar me i'm going 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.130
 not do it because I have rare bwin 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.420
 archive hours finally I put that the 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.159
 folders open passes with winrar 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.860
 gilbert more precisely I said 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:41.920
 absolutely touching is very boring 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.950
 then you take to the small fail 1.4.2 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.979
 hd that you downloaded at 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.710
 first I love the word before you 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:53.890
 select everything you drag me into 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.020
 your forgeard minecraft and that's it 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.510
 then you go to your 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.170
 bankroll jar point and you delete 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.130
 the folder but you simply 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.210
 then you can leave everything 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.349
 that we'll leave it down here 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.069
 then you go back to your 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:14.019
 folder you have these covers v10 rc5 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.989
 will formalize full field you make a 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.999
 right click extract paid or CV 10 ma 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.580
 room and you'll see in ti oc who 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:23.970
 will not be next 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.710
 you have shader 1.6 mc 1.4.2 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.590
 you do the same thing right 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.540
 extract to shader stuff and you have 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.670
 your two folders then you go 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.100
 in the folder these v10 covers that you 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.560
 had had shader zone neither you 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.890
 select everything you need to be click 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.260
 law 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.620
 copy or control it's like you 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:48.150
 then you want to go to shader 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:51.030
 2.6 mach 1 shader content shader mode 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.460
 filed shader you right click 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.410
 stick to v controls as you want 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.750
 and there you apply my choices 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.230
 for the next seventeen conflicts and 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.450
 copy is replaced here is simply 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.030
 Then you come back a little earlier there 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.390
 in and you have an application that 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.640
 is called list you click on it and 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.160
 then you do install mode in 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.110
 top right of the whey of the small 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.280
 application that has just launched 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.959
 then you 're going to wait for everything 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.930
 simply that it settles meal king 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.420
 jar and facilities komplete then 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.769
 you have in your view log and you 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.060
 look if you do not have a message 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.980
 of error because it is possible that 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.600
 for example, if you have 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.730
 already modes to install all this and 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.080
 that they come into conflict with them with 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.700
 the shader but as you see me 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.310
 shader success crazy line stage 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.730
 finally the talent is rather and there is no 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.380
 problem 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.590
 it worked very well you can 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.630
 leave this is so the shader is 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.080
 installed you can normally play 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.260
 with 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.910
 but for a little more besides that that 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.230
 I gave you the the strength and where 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.940
 under the 10 you open it is 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.660
 perfect it's just fine 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.940
 allow to be able to put almost 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.100
 any texture pack with the 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.709
 shader about 80% something like 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.780
 that then you go back to your 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.920
 pin folder that you left down 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:16.590
 you open your forgeard minecraft 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:19.500
 then you take everything he 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.639
 is in the deal wanted to slip into 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.370
 your minecraft for jars 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.600
 just it's not harder than that 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.860
 then you can finally click close 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.080
 all because he's all that 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.400
 does not mean anything 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.630
 and normally everything is installed and I 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.000
 do not have easter texture for you 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.800
 show that it works well but you 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.660
 can test a it works very well at 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.830
 hand for example with the last 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.720
 structure not that I know it does not 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.130
 not just because he 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.419
 will look in other folders that 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.060
 have not been changed by the 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:46.680
 like for example for example the 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.110
 highlight of the red stone or all that 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.449
 so here I am going to create myself a new 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.180
 world to show you that it works 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:56.419
 well and that ladd and that the shader is 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:00.150
 correctly installed 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:02.520
 watch out here you see this shader 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.349
 very nice I respawn in the middle 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.389
 of a desert island in the middle of nowhere 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:09.120
 that does not prevent you from doing very well 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:11.009
 see that the water shader included in the 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.699
 shader is installed so you have a 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:17.340
 to really really nice then you 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:19.440
 have the shadows created by the sun there 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.410
 down you even have your shadow 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:26.300
 normally here we see my shadow on 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:30.510
 go see her here you see my shadow 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:33.289
 and on this amoeba to this tutorial this 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:37.289
 tutorial earlier and finished and finished here 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:39.930
 I hope you enjoyed it and especially 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:41.820
 that it will have been so if you want 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.960
 other tutorials about modes 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.880
 anything do not hesitate to tell me 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.430
