00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.030 
we can just crack down but you can see
they're<00:02:16.870> just<00:02:17.050> going<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:17.620> tilt<00:02:17.770> this<00:02:17.980> down

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
they're just going to tilt this down

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.350 
they're just going to tilt this down
just<00:02:18.550> a<00:02:18.850> little<00:02:18.880> bit

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
just a little bit

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.080 
just a little bit
okay<00:02:19.660> maybe<00:02:19.780> actually<00:02:20.050> tilt<00:02:20.230> it<00:02:20.350> up<00:02:21.000> so<00:02:22.000> we're

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
okay maybe actually tilt it up so we're

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.030 
okay maybe actually tilt it up so we're
going<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.300> get<00:02:22.360> too<00:02:23.170> much<00:02:23.200> glare<00:02:23.890> on<00:02:23.920> the

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
going to get too much glare on the

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.320 
going to get too much glare on the
screen<00:02:24.130> because<00:02:24.520> the<00:02:24.640> windows<00:02:24.970> are<00:02:25.000> giving

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
screen because the windows are giving

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.260 
screen because the windows are giving
some<00:02:25.510> glare<00:02:25.810> but<00:02:26.520> you<00:02:27.520> get<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:27.850> general<00:02:28.030> idea

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
some glare but you get the general idea

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.630 
some glare but you get the general idea
I'm<00:02:28.810> just<00:02:28.990> going<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.170> skip<00:02:29.470> through<00:02:29.650> we<00:02:30.370> get

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
I'm just going to skip through we get

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.580 
I'm just going to skip through we get
some<00:02:33.270> some<00:02:34.270> shots<00:02:34.540> there<00:02:34.780> for<00:02:34.960> you<00:02:35.050> so<00:02:35.440> you<00:02:35.500> can

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
some some shots there for you so you can

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.290 
some some shots there for you so you can
see<00:02:35.770> how<00:02:35.920> sharp<00:02:36.220> that<00:02:36.370> is<00:02:36.670> that<00:02:37.000> looks<00:02:37.180> very

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
see how sharp that is that looks very

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.810 
see how sharp that is that looks very
nice<00:02:37.570> tilt<00:02:38.380> this<00:02:38.500> down<00:02:38.560> again<00:02:39.040> a<00:02:39.220> little<00:02:39.700> bit

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
nice tilt this down again a little bit

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.450 
nice tilt this down again a little bit
more<00:02:40.740> you<00:02:41.740> guys<00:02:41.890> get<00:02:42.130> a<00:02:42.160> better<00:02:42.490> view<00:02:42.880> maybe<00:02:44.460> so

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
more you guys get a better view maybe so

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.520 
more you guys get a better view maybe so
you<00:02:45.520> but<00:02:46.090> you<00:02:46.180> get<00:02:46.330> the<00:02:46.420> general<00:02:46.570> idea<00:02:46.750> how<00:02:47.170> how

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
you but you get the general idea how how

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.240 
you but you get the general idea how how
good<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.430> monitor<00:02:48.910> actually<00:02:49.330> handles<00:02:50.250> video

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
good the monitor actually handles video

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.820 
good the monitor actually handles video
and<00:02:51.610> also<00:02:51.760> just<00:02:52.120> imagery<00:02:52.720> on<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.200> monitor<00:02:53.590> so

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
and also just imagery on the monitor so

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.890 
and also just imagery on the monitor so
besides<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.520> touch<00:02:54.700> screen<00:02:55.420> functionality

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
besides the touch screen functionality

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.510 
besides the touch screen functionality
so<00:02:56.170> I<00:02:56.200> can<00:02:56.380> easily<00:02:56.560> just<00:02:56.740> jump<00:02:57.010> out<00:02:57.100> there<00:02:57.310> let

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
so I can easily just jump out there let

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.730 
so I can easily just jump out there let
that<00:02:57.640> keep<00:02:57.940> playing<00:02:58.300> can<00:02:59.290> also<00:02:59.440> look<00:02:59.560> at<00:02:59.680> some

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
that keep playing can also look at some

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.620 
that keep playing can also look at some
touch<00:03:00.460> screen<00:03:00.640> controls<00:03:01.060> with<00:03:01.210> some<00:03:01.360> gaming

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
touch screen controls with some gaming

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.190 
touch screen controls with some gaming
here<00:03:01.960> so<00:03:02.110> I<00:03:02.170> believe<00:03:02.350> we<00:03:02.440> had<00:03:02.590> some<00:03:03.990> so<00:03:04.990> we<00:03:05.080> have

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
here so I believe we had some so we have

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.280 
here so I believe we had some so we have
Judge<00:03:05.440> Dredd<00:03:06.000> here<00:03:07.000> this<00:03:07.480> is<00:03:07.630> a<00:03:07.660> game<00:03:07.960> where

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
Judge Dredd here this is a game where

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
functionality so it's my fire button and

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:30.930 
functionality so it's my fire button and
I'm<00:03:23.350> fine<00:03:23.860> reload<00:03:24.640> reload<00:03:25.150> in<00:03:28.980> C<00:03:29.980> get<00:03:30.700> myself

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
I'm fine reload reload in C get myself

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.250 
I'm fine reload reload in C get myself
out<00:03:31.210> of<00:03:31.270> harm's<00:03:31.660> way<00:03:33.720> I'm<00:03:34.720> going<00:03:34.900> to<00:03:34.930> reload

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
out of harm's way I'm going to reload

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.880 
out of harm's way I'm going to reload

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
again so you can see how effective this

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.950 
again so you can see how effective this
is<00:03:41.340> just<00:03:42.340> die<00:03:42.490> but<00:03:43.090> it's<00:03:43.330> quite<00:03:43.540> easy<00:03:43.720> to<00:03:43.810> move

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:43.960 
is just die but it's quite easy to move

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.510 
is just die but it's quite easy to move
around<00:03:44.080> and<00:03:44.440> actually<00:03:44.860> function<00:03:45.250> and<00:03:45.370> play

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 
around and actually function and play

the game without having much issues

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.870 
the game without having much issues
because<00:03:48.010> using<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:48.490> monitor<00:03:48.820> itself<00:03:49.410> in<00:03:50.410> here

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
because using the monitor itself in here
