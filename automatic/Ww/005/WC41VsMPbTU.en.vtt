00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.840 

another<00:01:41.200> way<00:01:41.380> to<00:01:41.409> propel<00:01:41.859> people<00:01:42.219> away<00:01:42.429> from<00:01:42.729> a

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
another way to propel people away from a

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.230 
another way to propel people away from a
presentation<00:01:43.659> is<00:01:43.780> to<00:01:43.899> put<00:01:44.049> a<00:01:44.079> lot<00:01:44.350> in<00:01:44.619> it<00:01:44.770> and

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
presentation is to put a lot in it and

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.940 
presentation is to put a lot in it and
again<00:01:46.240> it's<00:01:46.420> about<00:01:46.630> control<00:01:47.109> so<00:01:47.499> there<00:01:47.920> are

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
again it's about control so there are

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.130 
again it's about control so there are
about<00:01:48.219> half<00:01:48.549> as<00:01:48.759> many<00:01:48.939> pieces<00:01:49.329> in<00:01:49.750> that<00:01:49.929> case

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
about half as many pieces in that case

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.289 
about half as many pieces in that case
as<00:01:50.469> we<00:01:50.799> might<00:01:51.219> have<00:01:51.399> been<00:01:51.520> inclined<00:01:51.880> to<00:01:52.000> put<00:01:52.149> in

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
as we might have been inclined to put in

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:54.910 
as we might have been inclined to put in
