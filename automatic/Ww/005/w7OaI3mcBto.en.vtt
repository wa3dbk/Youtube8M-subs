enough attention I've seen people say
about<00:00:06.210> my<00:00:06.629> scale<00:00:06.930> diet<00:00:07.230> lack<00:00:07.410> skill<00:00:07.799> but<00:00:08.040> I

about my scale diet lack skill but I

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.270 
about my scale diet lack skill but I

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
think it just kind of sometimes I think

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.240 
think it just kind of sometimes I think
about<00:00:11.580> working<00:00:12.049> harder<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.230> use<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.710> nice<00:00:13.950> bill
