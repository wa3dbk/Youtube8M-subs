00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
from other applications but what SoDo

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.230 
from other applications but what SoDo
does<00:01:09.030> different<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.890> in<00:01:10.890> its<00:01:11.100> way<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.610> allows

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
you to annotate PDFs so for example

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.950 
you to annotate PDFs so for example
there<00:01:14.700> are<00:01:14.729> two<00:01:14.939> kinds<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.360> PDFs<00:01:15.840> that

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
there are two kinds of PDFs that

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.560 
there are two kinds of PDFs that
normally<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.619> will<00:01:16.770> use<00:01:16.950> one<00:01:17.729> kind<00:01:18.090> will<00:01:18.360> have

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
normally you will use one kind will have

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.590 
normally you will use one kind will have
text<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:20.130> can<00:01:20.369> actually<00:01:20.580> select<00:01:21.060> and

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
text that you can actually select and

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.320 
text that you can actually select and
those<00:01:22.590> normally<00:01:22.979> comes<00:01:23.189> from<00:01:23.490> Word<00:01:23.700> documents

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
those normally comes from Word documents

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.179 
those normally comes from Word documents
that<00:01:24.570> are<00:01:24.689> transformed<00:01:25.170> into<00:01:25.320> PDF<00:01:25.680> files<00:01:25.950> and

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
that are transformed into PDF files and

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.870 
that are transformed into PDF files and
then<00:01:26.729> there<00:01:27.000> are<00:01:27.119> scans<00:01:27.560> that<00:01:28.560> people<00:01:29.490> do<00:01:29.640> from

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
then there are scans that people do from

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.780 
then there are scans that people do from
books<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.390> are<00:01:31.320> really<00:01:31.530> pictures<00:01:31.860> in<00:01:32.340> PDF

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
books that are really pictures in PDF

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.230 
books that are really pictures in PDF
format<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.869> SoDo<00:01:34.290> handled<00:01:35.280> both<00:01:35.520> files

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
format so SoDo handled both files

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.810 
format so SoDo handled both files
perfectly<00:01:36.960> for<00:01:37.619> example<00:01:38.070> it's<00:01:38.220> open<00:01:38.549> one<00:01:38.729> of

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
perfectly for example it's open one of

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.069 
perfectly for example it's open one of
those<00:01:38.970> where<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.079> text<00:01:40.439> can<00:01:40.829> be<00:01:40.880> edited<00:01:42.079> so

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
those where the text can be edited so

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.749 
those where the text can be edited so
I'm<00:01:43.170> just<00:01:43.320> going<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.530> click<00:01:43.740> on<00:01:43.770> this<00:01:43.979> one<00:01:44.040> and

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
I'm just going to click on this one and

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.420 
I'm just going to click on this one and
you<00:01:44.820> see<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.200> can<00:01:46.649> just<00:01:46.860> zoom<00:01:47.040> in<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.310> out

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
you see that I can just zoom in and out

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.030 
you see that I can just zoom in and out
and<00:01:47.790> it's<00:01:48.450> very<00:01:48.509> responsive<00:01:49.350> it's<00:01:49.829> very

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
and it's very responsive it's very

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.760 
and it's very responsive it's very
smooth<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.780> for<00:01:51.780> example<00:01:52.140> if<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.320> need<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.619> make

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
smooth and for example if I need to make

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.120 
smooth and for example if I need to make
annotations<00:01:53.009> here<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.850> can<00:01:54.450> just<00:01:54.479> slide<00:01:55.350> from

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130
