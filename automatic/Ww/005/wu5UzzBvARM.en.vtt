have in hand right now but to contrast
these<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:33.059> Fujiwara<00:00:33.920> we're<00:00:34.920> about

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
these to the Fujiwara we're about

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.350 
these to the Fujiwara we're about
Steel's<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.550> all<00:00:35.700> that<00:00:35.850> but<00:00:35.970> let's<00:00:36.120> look<00:00:36.240> at

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
Steel's and all that but let's look at

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.570 
Steel's and all that but let's look at
the<00:00:36.450> weight<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.720> Fujiwara<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.560> six<00:00:37.980> ounces

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:38.580 
the weight the Fujiwara is six ounces

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.490 
the weight the Fujiwara is six ounces
verses<00:00:39.270> about<00:00:39.420> seven<00:00:39.990> for<00:00:40.830> the<00:00:41.660> toe<00:00:42.660> zero<00:00:42.930> the

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
verses about seven for the toe zero the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.620 
verses about seven for the toe zero the
Fujiwara<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.130> mono<00:00:44.400> steel<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.970> tozi<00:00:45.360> row<00:00:45.420> is

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:45.630 
Fujiwara is mono steel the tozi row is

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.080 
Fujiwara is mono steel the tozi row is
clad<00:00:46.110> so<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.980> zero<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.490> little<00:00:47.700> bit<00:00:47.790> heavier

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
clad so the zero is a little bit heavier

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.020 
clad so the zero is a little bit heavier
it's<00:00:48.240> got<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.390> little<00:00:48.690> bit<00:00:48.780> bigger<00:00:48.930> handle<00:00:49.530> and

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
it's got a little bit bigger handle and

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.880 
it's got a little bit bigger handle and
there's<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.120> little<00:00:51.270> bit<00:00:51.450> of<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.660> cladding<00:00:52.620> line

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
there's a little bit of a cladding line

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.890 
there's a little bit of a cladding line
on<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.430> that<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.670> can<00:00:53.820> see<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.750> my

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
on it that you can see this is my

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.630 
on it that you can see this is my
personal<00:00:55.380> knife<00:00:55.739> at<00:00:55.920> home<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.310> it's<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.489> little

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
personal knife at home so it's a little

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.380 
personal knife at home so it's a little
bit<00:00:56.850> scratched<00:00:57.420> up<00:00:57.600> from<00:00:57.840> wear<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.230> tear<00:00:58.410> and

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
bit scratched up from wear and tear and

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.090 
bit scratched up from wear and tear and
this<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.540> one<00:01:00.690> right<00:01:00.870> out<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.140> box<00:01:01.350> the

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
this is one right out of the box the

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.969 
this is one right out of the box the
blade<00:01:02.700> length<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.329> pretty<00:01:04.229> similar<00:01:04.470> on<00:01:04.649> these

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
blade length is pretty similar on these

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.980 
blade length is pretty similar on these
the<00:01:05.369> Fujiwara<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.509> a<00:01:06.540> little<00:01:06.689> bit<00:01:06.780> longer

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
the Fujiwara is a little bit longer

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.680 
the Fujiwara is a little bit longer
overall<00:01:07.979> length<00:01:08.159> pretty<00:01:08.430> close<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:09.510> big

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
overall length pretty close the big

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.210 
overall length pretty close the big
difference<00:01:10.050> on<00:01:10.200> these<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.800> shape<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
difference on these is the shape of the

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.450 
difference on these is the shape of the
blade<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.820> also<00:01:12.120> the<00:01:12.420> weight<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.650> handle

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
blade and also the weight so the handle

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.790 
blade and also the weight so the handle
so<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:15.450> kind<00:01:15.690> of<00:01:15.750> see<00:01:15.930> here<00:01:16.050> the<00:01:16.200> handle<00:01:16.560> on

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
so you kind of see here the handle on

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.640 
so you kind of see here the handle on
the<00:01:17.690> tozi<00:01:18.690> row<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:18.960> actually<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.350> little<00:01:19.530> bit

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
the tozi row is actually a little bit

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.620 
the tozi row is actually a little bit
bigger<00:01:19.950> it's<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.340> little<00:01:20.580> bit<00:01:20.700> beefier<00:01:21.060> handle

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
bigger it's a little bit beefier handle

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.469 
bigger it's a little bit beefier handle
it's<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.170> little<00:01:22.380> wider<00:01:23.090> and<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.180> little<00:01:24.390> bit

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
it's a little wider and a little bit

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.570 
it's a little wider and a little bit
bigger<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:24.870> way<00:01:25.110> it's<00:01:26.070> made<00:01:26.310> out<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.460> a

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
bigger this way it's made out of a

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.430 
bigger this way it's made out of a
little<00:01:26.700> bit<00:01:26.820> different<00:01:27.090> material<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.930> the

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
little bit different material and the

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.570 
little bit different material and the
fit<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.740> finish<00:01:28.830> actually<00:01:29.220> in<00:01:29.460> this

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
fit and finish actually in this

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.490 
fit and finish actually in this
particular<00:01:29.760> sample<00:01:30.330> is<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.690> little<00:01:30.960> bit<00:01:31.110> nicer

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
particular sample is a little bit nicer

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.200 
particular sample is a little bit nicer
on<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.710> tozi<00:01:32.130> row<00:01:32.190> there's<00:01:32.700> really<00:01:32.820> not<00:01:33.060> much

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
on the tozi row there's really not much

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.530 
on the tozi row there's really not much
of<00:01:33.420> any<00:01:33.570> kind<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.869> gaps<00:01:34.380> or<00:01:34.650> raised<00:01:35.580> parts<00:01:36.450> of

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
of any kind of gaps or raised parts of

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.390 
of any kind of gaps or raised parts of
the<00:01:36.630> metal<00:01:36.900> here<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.320> think<00:01:37.979> their<00:01:38.130> handle

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
the metal here I think their handle

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.380 
the metal here I think their handle
material<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:38.880> probably<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.180> little<00:01:39.270> more

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
material is probably a little more

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.050 
material is probably a little more
stabilized<00:01:40.080> than<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.830> pack<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.220> wood<00:01:41.369> on<00:01:41.610> the

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
stabilized than the pack of wood on the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.730 
stabilized than the pack of wood on the
food<00:01:42.210> URL<00:01:42.600> so<00:01:42.750> this<00:01:42.900> does<00:01:43.080> have<00:01:43.260> just<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.560> little

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
food URL so this does have just a little

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.550 
food URL so this does have just a little
bit<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:44.130> feel<00:01:45.090> where<00:01:45.330> the<00:01:45.510> Tang<00:01:45.900> is<00:01:46.110> coming<00:01:46.439> out

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
bit of feel where the Tang is coming out

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.550 
bit of feel where the Tang is coming out
not<00:01:46.830> much<00:01:47.070> it's<00:01:47.340> very<00:01:47.400> small<00:01:47.909> but<00:01:48.540> if<00:01:49.080> you're

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
not much it's very small but if you're

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.380 
not much it's very small but if you're
going<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.799> get<00:01:50.400> a<00:01:50.460> little<00:01:50.610> bit<00:01:50.790> nitpicky<00:01:51.240> this

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
going to get a little bit nitpicky this

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
for a finer more pointed tip and so the

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.490 
for a finer more pointed tip and so the
blade<00:02:21.000> profile<00:02:21.510> themselves<00:02:22.019> are<00:02:22.110> pretty<00:02:22.230> darn

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
blade profile themselves are pretty darn

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.280 
blade profile themselves are pretty darn
similar<00:02:22.910> but<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.030> tip<00:02:24.239> is<00:02:24.420> quite<00:02:24.989> a<00:02:25.019> bit<00:02:25.200> of

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
similar but the tip is quite a bit of

similar but the tip is quite a bit of
difference<00:02:25.620> there<00:02:25.800> on<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.400> feel<00:02:26.610> on<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.879> tip

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
difference there on the feel on the tip

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.390 
difference there on the feel on the tip
these<00:02:27.840> are<00:02:28.019> both<00:02:28.170> pretty<00:02:28.650> darn<00:02:28.860> sharp<00:02:29.069> out<00:02:29.280> of

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
these are both pretty darn sharp out of

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.610 
these are both pretty darn sharp out of
the<00:02:29.459> box<00:02:30.019> performance<00:02:31.019> wise<00:02:31.230> these<00:02:31.500> are

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
the box performance wise these are

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.949 
the box performance wise these are
pretty<00:02:31.890> close<00:02:32.340> so<00:02:33.150> it<00:02:33.269> just<00:02:33.450> kind<00:02:33.629> of<00:02:33.660> depends

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
pretty close so it just kind of depends

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.839 
pretty close so it just kind of depends
on<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.200> feel<00:02:34.530> that<00:02:35.099> you're<00:02:35.280> interested<00:02:35.459> in

on the feel that you're interested in

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.270 
on the feel that you're interested in

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
obtaining so if you've got smaller hands

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.949 
obtaining so if you've got smaller hands
and<00:02:38.489> you<00:02:38.790> want<00:02:38.910> a<00:02:39.000> little<00:02:39.180> bit<00:02:39.360> smaller<00:02:39.690> more

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.360 
and you want a little bit smaller more
slender<00:02:40.260> handle<00:02:40.680> this<00:02:40.769> does<00:02:40.950> have<00:02:41.129> a<00:02:41.160> little

the<00:02:44.129> fujiwara<00:02:44.670> might<00:02:44.910> be<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.330> good<00:02:46.080> fit<00:02:46.319> for<00:02:46.349> you

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
the fujiwara might be a good fit for you

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.440 
the fujiwara might be a good fit for you
if<00:02:46.920> you<00:02:47.370> want<00:02:47.549> to<00:02:47.640> handle<00:02:47.879> it<00:02:48.000> slightly<00:02:48.269> more

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
if you want to handle it slightly more

if you want to handle it slightly more

bit more weight these are fairly close

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:57.800 
bit more weight these are fairly close
in<00:02:56.160> performance<00:02:56.849> though<00:02:57.060> so<00:02:57.299> it's<00:02:57.450> more<00:02:57.599> of<00:02:57.660> a

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
in performance though so it's more of a

no problem with it as well so it's not
