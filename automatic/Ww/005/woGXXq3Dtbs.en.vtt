00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello I 'm martrix that's exactly 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.020
 Welcome to a new video today 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.139
 there are times after half an eternity 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.259
 a nuclear gameplay from me this time 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.590
 multi team kill confirmed on yemen 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.240
 the wonderfully strong at 490 I have 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.220
 by the way with the sl scorpion and 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.820
 played one of his clan members 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.220
 and people have noticed a thing 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.570
 somehow it's really easy now 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.210
 become in black ops 2 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.940
 to reach a nuclear mine 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.860
 not the whole of the beginnings in 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.899
 black ops have two comparisons back then 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.210
 I always attack a reign with 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.070
 the farmer played you away with the pgw 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.420
 By now she is better again 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.399
 but there was a time 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.890
 There she was so shitty and I got it 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.000
 the weapon so highly praised as well 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.180
 In any case I have always 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.059
 always played on the throne so 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.559
 Orbital satellites of the form in the best 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.180
 case I had completely unconscious in 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.850
 nuclear was done because then 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.559
 really nuclear, what is it? 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.359
 he would at least mean it to me 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.339
 and if I really jump right up 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.950
 The nuclear wants to play then you have 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.720
 keep free for all searched then still with 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.939
 the bouncing betty or the claim in 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.860
 combination with founder there then the 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.590
 taken drone and you had it 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.630
 In the best case n'dour da bouncing 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.939
 betis still make some kills you do 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.710
 kills himself and hopes for a 30 0 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.680
 with it then in the end in the player 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.900
 statistics to see the nuclear medal 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.240
 although they are not in game at all 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.090
 That's why it was so 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.070
 always not so cool thing but 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.619
 Apparently, this trend is gone, I have 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.049
 Almost nobody is playing more in the ground 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.619
 attack properly on nuclear 1 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.060
 today is cutting-edge multi team being 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.280
 I already heard that in 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.680
 ultimate many try harder on the go 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.119
 are in the act of doing already too well known 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.520
 it's about the same as with the 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.899
 hipsters that the mode actually only 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.610
 still every departure because you actually 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.530
 German always finds that exactly 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.619
 we try the same one ourselves 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.299
 namely to reach nucleus and me 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.399
 really missed something you know 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.320
 yes people I have months now 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.170
 Monthly break made the view 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.729
 two especially on the console 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.740
 when I arrive the day I do the whole thing 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.080
 has been playing the way I believe two hatch yes 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.470
 even each one was not comfortable for months 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.640
 gambled although I have such a long time 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.290
 made a break 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.880
 after a bit of a game is me 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.170
 then the nuclear I succeeded 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.480
 did not think it was that easy 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.830
 but people it is really easy 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.630
 Firstly , only by the strong 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.090
 weapon was me first time one 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.450
 really fat yes the typical try harder 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.860
 put it straight to the heart and 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.709
 then of course with a bit 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.959
 permanent orbital satellite is the whole thing 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.450
 really no problem but a thing 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.480
 But it is good if you have fun 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.519
 kohlelobby finds and I really have to 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.190
 say and I say that I too 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.540
 mine if you really are not regular 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.790
 in black ops 2 or just in the 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.430
 current cod part in it is then 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.220
 you miss a lot while you think 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.850
 always yes in the cio de da is always everything 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.370
 equal 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.750
 but if you take the last actions now 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.549
 a bit from the developers 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.459
 I follow my all the patches 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.780
 Also example of the patch from the PGW or 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.640
 even the storm rifles became one 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.230
 hochputputscht long time I think her 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.700
 have all noticed even better 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.000
 has himself or here too 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:23.329
 Recently with the sniper nerf where even 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.310
 Some people are therefore threatened by death 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:27.590
 to have thrown a head 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.209
 a bit crass or how to get that 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.160
 comments what actually thinks about it 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.280
 then you realize that in any case already 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.720
 cod black ops 2 has changed that 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.910
 Maybe it's just part of it 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.480
 special bit more extreme like the 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.980
 other 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.260
 but you still have to 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.940
 that also because of the 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.820
 community because of the youtube community 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.769
 just that i just play the game 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.650
 fun or the game pretty much 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:53.480
 changes meanwhile you play completely 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.730
 other modes in the beginning was still multi 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.799
 team thinks you 're more like it 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.079
 or less something new and nowadays 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.549
 Of course, almost every mode is included 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:03.170
 the popular almost every player 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.400
 of course, with a few exceptions halt 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.810
 because of the 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.670
 unwanted people so if you do not 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.769
 good lobbies will definitely 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.980
 I claim you really have to 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:14.870
 Be there regularly to get it right 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.340
 cash registers overestimated, so to speak 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.079
 So if you can really be one 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.850
 wants to be awesome with the gameplay 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.289
 I want to assert that if you do 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.680
 Now a little break makes that one 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:26.300
 Immediately only fucking gameplays has instantly 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.250
 Because I have mine with me it is ready 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.930
 then otherwise, and I mean mine 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.850
 We are not the gameplay now 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.979
 shit fool but still shit 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.150
 nice to look at and you know because 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.250
 I will always go to theory ghost 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.900
 still maybe the one or the other 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.690
 play another world premiere 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.430
 Well let's have a look and I mean you 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.289
 just have to be there regularly 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.600
 It's the same as in sports. You always have to be fit 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:51.260
 stay up to date 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:53.270
 which one had to take preparations or 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.669
 how best to train with it 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.130
 you are always fit and on the way 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:59.810
 it stays the same and that's just how it should be 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.039
 actually be on a cod 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.110
 I do not know, maybe you also know 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:04.849
 you have finished this situation too 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.259
 a break made for me it was so 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:07.789
 early spring I just had that 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:09.440
 do not bother anymore on black ops 2 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:10.580
 maybe it's the same with you 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.050
 and if so write me your 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.599
 Opinion in the comments 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.500
 that would interest me very much 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:17.539
 it was actually with the 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.979
 video today a little spontaneous 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:20.930
 commentary with a little spontaneous 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:22.310
 I hope, of course , he is 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.630
 failed if you liked it 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.169
 Of course you can do a rating there 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.240
 to let 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:28.550
 that's it i think i'm in now 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.080
 cee oligo in any case maybe it 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.630
 go through in any case 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.690
 playing regularly will be so bad 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.159
 I think black ops 2 is not cod 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.289
 Although a bit monotonous but 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:41.840
 if you do not argue so badly now 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:43.880
 already fun you know yes I am one 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.070
 Worth a little better mood 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:49.510
 whatever the next thing 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.510
 times people look and adiós
