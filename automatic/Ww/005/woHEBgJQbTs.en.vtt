out<00:01:02.239> of<00:01:02.450> this<00:01:02.570> tire<00:01:02.780> so<00:01:03.079> it's<00:01:03.530> giving<00:01:03.829> us<00:01:03.980> just

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:04.399 
out of this tire so it's giving us just

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:08.080 
out of this tire so it's giving us just
as<00:01:04.610> much<00:01:04.640> grip<00:01:05.390> in<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:05.689> hard<00:01:06.590> crazy<00:01:07.460> off-road

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
as much grip in the hard crazy off-road

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.520 
as much grip in the hard crazy off-road
sections<00:01:08.600> and<00:01:08.810> how<00:01:08.840> are<00:01:09.020> you<00:01:09.079> finding<00:01:09.259> on<00:01:09.469> the

sections and how are you finding on the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.649 
sections and how are you finding on the
street<00:01:09.770> landon<00:01:10.100> excellent<00:01:10.880> i<00:01:11.060> would<00:01:11.389> have<00:01:11.479> to

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
street landon excellent i would have to

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.410 
street landon excellent i would have to
say<00:01:11.689> that<00:01:11.869> the<00:01:12.170> crew<00:01:12.409> 3<00:01:12.710> is<00:01:12.829> a<00:01:12.859> true<00:01:13.429> 50/50<00:01:14.179> tire

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
say that the crew 3 is a true 50/50 tire

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.419 
say that the crew 3 is a true 50/50 tire
so<00:01:15.200> in<00:01:15.350> the<00:01:15.409> tradition<00:01:15.799> of<00:01:15.859> the<00:01:15.979> true<00:01:16.189> nob

00:01:16.419 --> 00:01:16.429 
so in the tradition of the true nob

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:18.279 
so in the tradition of the true nob
usually<00:01:16.850> they're<00:01:16.969> just<00:01:16.999> square<00:01:17.420> blocks<00:01:17.719> what

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
usually they're just square blocks what

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:20.679 
usually they're just square blocks what
kind<00:01:18.439> of<00:01:18.969> performance<00:01:19.969> have<00:01:20.090> you<00:01:20.179> seen<00:01:20.450> from

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
kind of performance have you seen from

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:22.270 
kind of performance have you seen from
the<00:01:20.840> modified<00:01:21.259> tread<00:01:21.499> pattern<00:01:21.770> of<00:01:21.829> the<00:01:21.920> crew<00:01:22.069> 3

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
the modified tread pattern of the crew 3

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.059 
the modified tread pattern of the crew 3
they've<00:01:22.609> got<00:01:22.789> kind<00:01:23.060> of<00:01:23.209> a<00:01:23.359> trapezoid<00:01:23.899> shape<00:01:24.319> on

00:01:25.059 --> 00:01:25.069 
they've got kind of a trapezoid shape on

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:28.209 
they've got kind of a trapezoid shape on
the<00:01:25.189> sidewalls<00:01:25.729> and<00:01:26.439> not<00:01:27.439> only<00:01:27.590> is<00:01:28.100> it

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:28.219 
the sidewalls and not only is it

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:30.760 
the sidewalls and not only is it
beneficial<00:01:28.789> on<00:01:29.090> the<00:01:29.209> street<00:01:29.659> i<00:01:29.929> find<00:01:30.679> that

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
beneficial on the street i find that

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.940 
beneficial on the street i find that
they<00:01:30.950> get<00:01:31.130> more<00:01:31.700> coverage<00:01:32.560> farther<00:01:33.560> down<00:01:33.799> on

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
they get more coverage farther down on

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.730 
they get more coverage farther down on
the<00:01:34.069> tire<00:01:34.310> but<00:01:35.060> they<00:01:35.299> also<00:01:35.479> tend<00:01:36.200> to<00:01:36.289> throw

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
the tire but they also tend to throw

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.370 
the tire but they also tend to throw
material<00:01:37.459> off<00:01:37.670> to<00:01:37.999> the<00:01:38.149> sides<00:01:38.420> a<00:01:38.810> lot<00:01:39.139> better

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
material off to the sides a lot better

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.739 
material off to the sides a lot better
than<00:01:39.829> most<00:01:40.039> other<00:01:40.310> tires<00:01:40.609> because<00:01:41.299> of<00:01:41.600> their

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:41.749 
than most other tires because of their

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:44.199 
than most other tires because of their
shape<00:01:41.929> so<00:01:42.799> the<00:01:42.920> crew<00:01:43.100> 3<00:01:43.399> if<00:01:43.549> you're<00:01:43.729> looking<00:01:44.090> to

00:01:44.199 --> 00:01:44.209 
shape so the crew 3 if you're looking to

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:50.010 
shape so the crew 3 if you're looking to
get<00:01:44.420> maximum<00:01:45.319> off-road<00:01:46.069> performance

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.639 

it's<00:01:51.020> maximum

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
it's maximum

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:53.139 
it's maximum
on-road<00:01:52.009> performance<00:01:52.070> and<00:01:52.700> you're<00:01:52.850> looking

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
on-road performance and you're looking

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.209 
on-road performance and you're looking
to<00:01:53.240> get<00:01:53.390> more<00:01:53.630> than<00:01:53.840> say<00:01:54.020> 2500<00:01:54.740> miles<00:01:54.890> at<00:01:55.070> your
