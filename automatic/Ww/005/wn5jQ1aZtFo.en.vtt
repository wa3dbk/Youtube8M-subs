we<00:00:25.869> chose<00:00:26.140> a<00:00:26.199> deep<00:00:26.619> water<00:00:26.890> passage<00:00:27.460> in<00:00:27.670> order

we chose a deep water passage in order

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:29.939 
we chose a deep water passage in order
to<00:00:28.090> avoid<00:00:28.390> the<00:00:28.630> strong<00:00:28.900> low<00:00:29.170> that<00:00:29.470> lives<00:00:29.710> over

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:29.949 
to avoid the strong low that lives over

to avoid the strong low that lives over
Colombia<00:00:30.660> our<00:00:31.660> plan<00:00:31.960> was<00:00:32.169> to<00:00:32.230> sail<00:00:32.619> north<00:00:32.980> west

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
Colombia our plan was to sail north west

Colombia our plan was to sail north west
towards<00:00:33.699> your<00:00:33.850> maica<00:00:34.059> around<00:00:34.629> the<00:00:34.780> top<00:00:35.019> of<00:00:35.199> the

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
towards your maica around the top of the

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.969 
towards your maica around the top of the
low<00:00:35.470> and<00:00:35.739> then<00:00:36.280> turn<00:00:36.550> south<00:00:36.580> for<00:00:37.210> pamela<00:00:37.659> on

the edge of the low the wind and seas

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.210 
the edge of the low the wind and seas
would<00:00:40.839> be<00:00:41.019> less<00:00:41.229> strong<00:00:43.379> even<00:00:44.379> so<00:00:44.650> we<00:00:44.949> still
