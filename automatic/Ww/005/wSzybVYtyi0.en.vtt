00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.690
Shut the flap-jabbing, Kragadonkus!

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.690
Shut Up! Cartoons

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.690
Born at the edge of the world,
Product of science, a fire-breathing giant,

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.690
At war with the folly of man
And man nearly destroyed him,

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:22.690
The change unemployed him,
He's KROGZILLA: the monster who got down-sized.

00:00:26.229 --> 00:00:28.229
Krog, welcome to the Big Dogs family.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.380
It's Krogzilla.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.640
Well Krog is all that fits on your name tag,
so let's leave it at that, okay?

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.190
So we just-- are you changing my name?

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.010
Here at Big Dogs, we serve the tastiest hotdogs
with the most outrageous toppings. There's

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.500
cheese, sour cream, chocolate...

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.969
Wow, I have eaten a sea urchin before but
I don't think I could stomach that.

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.629
Your commentary is not welcome, Captain Mc-Smarticus!
I'm gonna let Marcus train you on the fryer.

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:50.300
MARCUS!

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.370
Yeah, I'm wayyyyy over here. Three
inches from you.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.750
Sorry, didn't see you there. Marcus, can
you take over? I've got the noon rush coming

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.300
in.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.050
There's only one guy over there.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.370
Already? It's heating up! And a CAR! Drive
Thru, man your

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.140
stations! We've got a car in play! A car!
Man up!

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.470
This is where he calls in the National Guard
and the Air Force. Pretty exciting.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.620
The Air Force used to shoot at me, so...

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.840
Oh, man, my bad. You're that sea monster
that stormed New York, right?

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.950
That was a long time ago. No sweat.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.770
No, that was totally rude. Sorry.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.610
I'm gonna tear you up!

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.060
Easy, Jeff. It's fine.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.320
So you take his side? You're turning on
me now?

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.350
Oh, please Jeff, don't ever leave me. Please
don't uncork yourself from my neck and go

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.070
off to lead your own life.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.670
I had a roommate like that.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.910
So you know, right?

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.280
"So you know, right?"Å¥ Ooo, you two make
a cute couple. Why don't you just go get

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.000
married and then go get me some fries!

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.080
Did you ever think you'd work at a place
like this?

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.600
Oh yeah, it's what I went to school for.
I got my degree in French Fries.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.970
I can tell we're going to be friends.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.150
So you drop the cage in, you press the button,
it dings. Pretty complicated.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.900
It looks like it.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.030
Hey skater-punk, I'm gonna give you another
chance. Because I like you.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.300
Because you want me to give you free French
fries?

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.200
Ahhhh, seriously? Can I have some?

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.829
Jeff, I am working!

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:14.530
Make sure you always use the tongs or the
gloves on this.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.439
No, no. Check it out.

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.609
Nice. But that probably isn't very sanitary.

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:27.540
No, it is NOT sanitary! Focus up! I need ten
dogs grilled in two minutes. Can you guys

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.950
handle that?

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:29.950
Can you handle this?

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.480
That was--it's-- okay, that was very impressive
yet a bit

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.159
disturbing. That makes you both a worthy crew
member and a fire hazard which I believe makes

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:48.459
me both love and fear you. Lots of emotions.
I'm going to go back to my office and process

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.140
what I just witnessed.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.280
We'll serve these up.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.840
Good! Go! Zip-a-dee-doo-da!

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.840
Zippa-what?

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:03.060
If you freak him out, crazy stuff just pours
out of his mouth. It's the best part of

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.730
the job.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.139
Hey, crazy stuff just poured out of MY mouth!
See what I did there?

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:07.680
Whooo!

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.590
You're going to kill a customer today, aren't
you?

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.530
No! But I sure would like to crush that car
out there, though.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.530
Shut the flap-jabbing, Kragadonkus!
