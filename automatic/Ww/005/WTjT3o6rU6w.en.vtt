should<00:01:57.600> all<00:01:57.780> right<00:01:58.049> now<00:01:58.200> say<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:59.189> know<00:01:59.310> or

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
should all right now say you know or

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.399 
should all right now say you know or
Kylie<00:02:00.390> think<00:02:00.659> about<00:02:00.899> each<00:02:01.049> other

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
Kylie think about each other

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.010 
Kylie think about each other
yeah<00:02:02.399> I<00:02:02.969> hate<00:02:03.540> always<00:02:05.240> Sunday<00:02:06.240> didn't<00:02:06.540> leave<00:02:06.719> I

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
yeah I hate always Sunday didn't leave I

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.670 
yeah I hate always Sunday didn't leave I
figured<00:02:07.380> as<00:02:07.469> much

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
figured as much

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.040 
figured as much
yeah<00:02:07.950> well<00:02:08.640> I'm<00:02:08.759> most<00:02:09.060> interested<00:02:09.300> in<00:02:09.569> cashing

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
yeah well I'm most interested in cashing

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.830 
yeah well I'm most interested in cashing
in<00:02:10.289> because<00:02:10.619> I

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
in because I

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.729 
in because I
those<00:02:11.170> hotel<00:02:11.680> people<00:02:11.890> if<00:02:11.980> I<00:02:12.099> had<00:02:12.250> known<00:02:13.560> $560<00:02:14.560> I

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
those hotel people if I had known $560 I

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.410 
those hotel people if I had known $560 I
looked<00:02:14.920> into<00:02:15.099> it<00:02:15.280> first<00:02:15.700> of<00:02:15.790> all<00:02:15.819> that<00:02:16.030> be<00:02:16.150> fun

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
looked into it first of all that be fun

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.030 
looked into it first of all that be fun
maybe<00:02:16.690> people<00:02:17.020> aren't<00:02:17.260> fleeing<00:02:17.560> for<00:02:17.890> like

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
maybe people aren't fleeing for like

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.530 
maybe people aren't fleeing for like
safety<00:02:18.489> reasons<00:02:18.819> maybe<00:02:18.940> it's<00:02:19.150> just<00:02:19.300> because

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
safety reasons maybe it's just because

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.449 
safety reasons maybe it's just because
how<00:02:20.080> cool<00:02:20.349> to<00:02:20.560> be<00:02:20.680> there<00:02:20.830> for<00:02:20.950> like<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.130> hoopla

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
how cool to be there for like the hoopla

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:31.699 
how cool to be there for like the hoopla
at<00:02:21.670> all<00:02:21.790> what<00:02:25.380> exists<00:02:26.380> it's<00:02:26.950> not<00:02:27.310> in<00:02:27.519> Serbia

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.370 

let's<00:02:32.709> go<00:02:32.860> to<00:02:32.920> Serbia<00:02:33.220> everything<00:02:33.900> like<00:02:34.900> if<00:02:35.200> I

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
let's go to Serbia everything like if I

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.530 
let's go to Serbia everything like if I
need<00:02:35.440> to<00:02:35.650> do<00:02:35.830> some<00:02:36.069> like<00:02:36.220> refugeeing<00:02:37.090> I'll<00:02:37.360> go

need to do some like refugeeing I'll go

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.690 
need to do some like refugeeing I'll go
to<00:02:37.599> Serbia<00:02:37.900> here's<00:02:38.800> the<00:02:39.040> thing<00:02:39.220> no<00:02:39.370> I<00:02:39.580> actually

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
to Serbia here's the thing no I actually

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.610 
to Serbia here's the thing no I actually
research<00:02:40.330> this<00:02:40.660> magic<00:02:41.050> mountain<00:02:41.319> because<00:02:41.500> it

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
research this magic mountain because it

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.800 
research this magic mountain because it
was<00:02:41.709> interesting<00:02:42.250> to<00:02:42.280> me<00:02:42.430> so<00:02:42.850> it<00:02:43.480> does

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
was interesting to me so it does

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.780 
was interesting to me so it does
supposedly<00:02:44.650> give<00:02:44.860> off<00:02:45.010> like<00:02:45.340> certain

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
supposedly give off like certain

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.729 
supposedly give off like certain
energies<00:02:46.330> like<00:02:46.600> the<00:02:46.720> water<00:02:46.930> is<00:02:47.140> different

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
energies like the water is different

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.949 
energies like the water is different
around<00:02:47.950> it<00:02:48.340> like<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:48.549> nearby<00:02:49.299> lakes<00:02:49.630> are

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
around it like the nearby lakes are

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.420 
around it like the nearby lakes are
different<00:02:50.680> than<00:02:50.799> like<00:02:50.950> if<00:02:51.130> you<00:02:51.280> were<00:02:51.340> to

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
different than like if you were to

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.370 
different than like if you were to
compare<00:02:51.549> it<00:02:51.730> with<00:02:51.760> other<00:02:52.030> lakes<00:02:52.299> and<00:02:52.660> they<00:02:53.140> say

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
compare it with other lakes and they say

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.830 
compare it with other lakes and they say
it's<00:02:54.250> different<00:02:54.430> from<00:02:54.730> each<00:02:54.850> other<00:02:55.000> yes<00:02:55.330> but<00:02:55.810> I

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
it's different from each other yes but I

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.059 
it's different from each other yes but I
mean<00:02:56.110> like<00:02:56.200> chemically<00:02:56.680> like<00:02:56.860> there's

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
mean like chemically like there's

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:58.890 
mean like chemically like there's
something<00:02:57.310> there's<00:02:57.640> some<00:02:57.819> like<00:02:57.970> energy<00:02:58.510> okay

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
something there's some like energy okay

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.509 
something there's some like energy okay
do<00:02:59.170> you<00:02:59.319> believe<00:02:59.530> in<00:02:59.620> like<00:02:59.739> energy<00:03:00.099> fields<00:03:00.430> or

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
do you believe in like energy fields or

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:01.140 
do you believe in like energy fields or
anything<00:03:00.670> like<00:03:00.819> that

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
anything like that

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.089 
anything like that
science<00:03:01.660> proves<00:03:01.900> that<00:03:02.200> I<00:03:02.530> believe<00:03:02.980> in

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
science proves that I believe in

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:04.650 
science proves that I believe in
mermaids<00:03:03.340> and<00:03:03.730> if<00:03:03.880> there<00:03:04.060> are<00:03:04.180> mermaids<00:03:04.450> in

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
mermaids and if there are mermaids in

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.990 
mermaids and if there are mermaids in
that<00:03:04.810> lake<00:03:05.049> or<00:03:05.200> ocean<00:03:08.340> how<00:03:09.340> is<00:03:09.519> that<00:03:09.670> really

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
that lake or ocean how is that really

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.039 
that lake or ocean how is that really
gonna<00:03:10.120> shield<00:03:10.480> you<00:03:10.810> from<00:03:11.069> doomsday

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
gonna shield you from doomsday

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.509 
gonna shield you from doomsday
supposedly<00:03:14.049> an<00:03:14.140> invisible<00:03:14.709> planet<00:03:15.130> that's

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
supposedly an invisible planet that's

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.550 
supposedly an invisible planet that's
gonna<00:03:15.760> slam<00:03:16.120> into<00:03:16.299> us<00:03:16.540> and<00:03:16.690> kill<00:03:16.840> us<00:03:16.870> daddy<00:03:17.260> one
