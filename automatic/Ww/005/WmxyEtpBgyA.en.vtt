00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:07.270
 Hello everyone, finally came to me 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:10.420
 parcel from China she went about one and a half 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:12.849
 of the month it's a lavalier microphone and now 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.590
 sound is written to the camera specifically to 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.710
 Somehow I will connect 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.099
 and look at the quality of the microphone let's 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.430
 her 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:24.779
 boom to open already such here 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.779
 from here millimeter soloist with 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:49.059
 open your mouth microphone mode such 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:51.749
 35 millimeter connector and clip 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:51.749
 plastic 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.940
 I let it all now ruble straight 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:01.859
 with you in your camcorder 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:08.590
 and I just support this feature and 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:11.020
 look at the quality so this thing 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.909
 I will bring the card 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:23.310
 but this thing stuck in the camcorder 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:23.310
 let's go two three 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:32.689
 So 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:35.990
 1 time recording is now from the microphone 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:42.079
 if he works now I will drag a little 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:45.829
 almost on camera shows that he 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:48.799
 not working friends it turns out you need 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:51.259
 first stick the microphone in the camera before 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:55.069
 how to press the record and then 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:57.319
 write down and I was wrong it works and you 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:02:03.439
 you yourself hear how you can evaluate the quality 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:06.289
 sound this microphone here i hold it 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:09.940
 approximately 10 centimeters from 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:11.959
 a horde without a clip just in hand and 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.660
 rate sound recording 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.200
 I ordered it not on the site aliexpress 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.530
 I made a reservation I ordered on the site 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.660
 tinydeal.com 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.329
 and still don't advise you to order 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.060
 because it goes without track numbers and 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:28.250
 may not even give to you and if 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.459
 Rejected too this is hemorrhoids and 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:37.209
 Still, this microphone is defective 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:38.540
 because gypsum and here she see it 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.819
 broken 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.489
 I can not hook her to the microphone 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.709
 because she 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:48.470
 her hardware is broken off no one will be well 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:53.090
 for example, I would not raise a panic 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:56.060
 for a two dollar microphone I'm sure 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:59.959
 Aliexpress is he and I will look if I find 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.910
 I'll take off the link in the description for this all 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:06.489
 maybe 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.489
