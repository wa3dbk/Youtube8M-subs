00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.299
 what do you know about the france team 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.820
 unexpectedly got us as mom 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.360
 managed to see but pretty 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.370
 performs well in this tournament 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.170
 went to the next round 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.500
 indicator 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:23.490
 proteco with love and these are irritants 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.990
 if it just means annoying 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:31.170
 if the person 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:35.340
 if the game you know is good 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:43.910
 the goalkeeper mean all my mother 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:46.289
 well still the question is not heard now 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.680
 not about life 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.170
 well yes of course the road is canned 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.270
 but there was no team to collect but 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.280
 here everyone understands it is not about 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.120
 last year's position means a final 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.250
 world championship 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.899
 the biggest reigned after two 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.280
 matches three days something very pleased 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.990
 building a team is really hard 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.549
 tune in after five wins when all 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.869
 about coming as you yourself are sensuality 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.229
 we are really a little bit 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.229
 magas 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.360
 yes it's hard to say so unequivocal and 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.340
 Accond 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.640
 game 1 develops differently in different ways 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:25.420
 develops, I think that we are playing 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.810
 give ourselves all together as a team I 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.490
 I think we had a good drive 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.649
 tell me to touch the captain for 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:37.149
 so as not to stop the defense to Denis 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:37.869
 who kira what to say but what means 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.820
 to scold 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:43.270
 I didn't think something special 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.369
 mistaken that hockey game is a game of mistakes and 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.200
 guys will make no mistakes here 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.869
 nothing terrible is it ok you 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.630
 attach you need to add 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:55.149
 Well, too, I do not advocate shouting and if 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.500
 explain tell there shout I 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.259
 I think that there is a coach who 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.270
 will tell correct rida 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.250
 if it burns in france what country are you 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.729
 love everyone worked in paris that is 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:10.290
 read inches from love culture but in 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:12.700
 principle interesting culture yes and we will go 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:15.280
 our team misses a lot 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.380
 throws the embassy releases you 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.630
 the french are not so bright concerned 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.290
 since it will be difficult to play when 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:26.549
 work will be less than usual 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:29.989
 but difficult to the last move in principle 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.989
 a little bulgarian for me 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.060
 that there is nothing to be done players game 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:45.780
 This game is a different game from the game that 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:49.650
 throws 40 digging for 15 cars to 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:55.470
 I feel good all night yesterday 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:58.590
 missed let's say yes here too difficult 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:03.239
 say here solve my case example 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.950
 go out on the ice and give and give 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:15.419
 yourself playing and working 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:18.060
 show all that is sinful by you 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:19.890
 you can cure it by two or three times per 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.050
 match okay 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.690
 but here I would say that that is the most 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:28.310
 most important victory no matter how will 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.900
 be like a game here you can not 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.720
 predict or predict before the game 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:40.230
 how will the matches evolve 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:45.410
 getting ready for on will work already 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.410
 spasibo bolshoe spasibo among luck
