from<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.630> palm<00:01:39.899> to<00:01:40.200> insert<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.740> effect<00:01:41.039> so

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
from the palm to insert the effect so

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.789 
from the palm to insert the effect so
let's<00:01:41.939> go<00:01:42.329> through<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.869> articulation<00:01:43.560> points

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
let's go through the articulation points

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.469 
let's go through the articulation points
for<00:01:43.920> this<00:01:44.009> figure<00:01:44.159> we<00:01:44.490> have<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.729> head<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.270> neck

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
for this figure we have a head and neck

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.319 
for this figure we have a head and neck
joint<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:46.350> should<00:01:46.950> push<00:01:47.249> this<00:01:47.579> color<00:01:48.060> right

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
joint you should push this color right

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.849 
joint you should push this color right
here<00:01:48.630> because<00:01:48.899> it's<00:01:49.020> part<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.319> the<00:01:49.469> neck<00:01:49.619> joint

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:49.859 
here because it's part of the neck joint

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:52.760 
here because it's part of the neck joint
so<00:01:50.429> it<00:01:50.609> will<00:01:50.789> allow<00:01:50.999> a<00:01:51.149> more<00:01:51.929> freedom<00:01:52.679> of

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
so it will allow a more freedom of

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.910 
so it will allow a more freedom of
movement<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.399> then<00:01:54.149> we<00:01:54.569> have<00:01:54.810> cups<00:01:55.710> right

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
movement and then we have cups right

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.419 
movement and then we have cups right
here<00:01:55.950> for<00:01:56.609> the<00:01:56.909> arm<00:01:57.299> joint<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.429> shoulder

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
here for the arm joint and shoulder

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:00.050 
here for the arm joint and shoulder
joint

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
joint

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.179 
joint
we<00:02:00.149> don't<00:02:00.359> have<00:02:00.749> an<00:02:00.960> upper<00:02:01.259> bicep<00:02:01.469> sole<00:02:01.799> but<00:02:02.159> I

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
we don't have an upper bicep sole but I

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.459 
we don't have an upper bicep sole but I
think<00:02:02.579> it's<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.880> big<00:02:03.270> joint<00:02:03.630> right<00:02:03.899> here<00:02:03.960> are

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
think it's a big joint right here are

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.429 
think it's a big joint right here are
connected<00:02:04.979> well<00:02:05.249> to<00:02:05.969> get<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:06.899> range<00:02:07.289> of

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
connected well to get that range of

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.440 
connected well to get that range of

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
even as you can see here this is quite

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.870 
even as you can see here this is quite
on<00:02:53.390> a<00:02:53.450> flesh<00:02:54.050> tone<00:02:54.590> and<00:02:54.620> then<00:02:55.190> we<00:02:55.400> have<00:02:55.520> yellow

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
on a flesh tone and then we have yellow

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.230 
on a flesh tone and then we have yellow
highlights<00:02:56.810> here<00:02:57.200> and<00:02:57.410> it's<00:02:57.890> again<00:02:58.580> it's<00:02:58.610> not

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
highlights here and it's again it's not

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.550 
highlights here and it's again it's not
even<00:02:59.750> and<00:02:59.960> then<00:03:00.740> the<00:03:01.690> abdominal<00:03:02.690> area<00:03:02.870> looks

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
even and then the abdominal area looks

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.160 
even and then the abdominal area looks
like<00:03:03.770> he<00:03:03.980> has<00:03:04.100> a<00:03:04.130> gut<00:03:04.550> or<00:03:04.790> he's<00:03:05.270> overweight<00:03:05.840> and

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
like he has a gut or he's overweight and

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.980 
like he has a gut or he's overweight and
you<00:03:06.770> can<00:03:06.920> see<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.190> Bulge<00:03:07.460> right<00:03:07.790> here<00:03:08.270> but<00:03:08.870> it

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
you can see the Bulge right here but it

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.560 
you can see the Bulge right here but it
doesn't<00:03:09.170> matter<00:03:09.440> whatever<00:03:09.800> you<00:03:10.360> post<00:03:11.360> up

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
doesn't matter whatever you post up

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.980 
doesn't matter whatever you post up
figure<00:03:12.110> on<00:03:12.350> different<00:03:12.860> ways<00:03:13.490> and<00:03:13.730> then<00:03:14.360> he<00:03:14.780> has

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
figure on different ways and then he has

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.350 
figure on different ways and then he has
a<00:03:15.020> weird<00:03:15.650> broad<00:03:16.190> shoulder<00:03:16.790> right<00:03:17.000> here

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
a weird broad shoulder right here

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.960 
a weird broad shoulder right here
probably<00:03:17.690> because<00:03:18.020> of<00:03:18.200> the<00:03:18.440> joint<00:03:19.250> but<00:03:19.610> then

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
probably because of the joint but then

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.790 
probably because of the joint but then
again<00:03:20.090> I<00:03:20.420> like<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:20.870> sculpting<00:03:21.290> of<00:03:21.410> the<00:03:21.500> figure

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
again I like the sculpting of the figure
I<00:03:21.950> like<00:03:22.160> the<00:03:23.050> overall<00:03:24.050> tone<00:03:24.530> and<00:03:24.980> whenever<00:03:25.550> you

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
I like the overall tone and whenever you

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.520 
I like the overall tone and whenever you
post<00:03:26.000> a<00:03:26.180> figure<00:03:26.540> in<00:03:26.840> like<00:03:27.350> for<00:03:27.470> example

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
slightly nude colors the abdominal could

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.050 
slightly nude colors the abdominal could
have<00:03:51.350> been<00:03:51.590> flatter<00:03:51.980> as<00:03:52.280> if<00:03:52.580> this<00:03:52.760> mode<00:03:53.030> makes

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
have been flatter as if this mode makes

probably<00:03:58.310> that<00:03:58.430> would<00:03:58.820> come<00:03:59.060> for<00:03:59.420> future

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810
