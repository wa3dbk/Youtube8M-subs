00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
surprise drop that I got from these

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.430 
surprise drop that I got from these
demons<00:04:03.920> while<00:04:04.370> I<00:04:04.430> was<00:04:04.730> testing<00:04:05.209> them<00:04:05.300> out<00:04:05.420> so<00:04:06.410> I

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
demons while I was testing them out so I

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.320 
demons while I was testing them out so I
did<00:04:06.680> not<00:04:06.830> mesh<00:04:07.040> pick<00:04:07.430> up<00:04:07.580> a<00:04:07.670> one<00:04:07.820> of<00:04:07.940> the<00:04:08.060> demon

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
did not mesh pick up a one of the demon

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:09.880 
did not mesh pick up a one of the demon
slayer<00:04:08.630> pieces<00:04:09.019> while<00:04:09.200> killing<00:04:09.410> these<00:04:09.620> but<00:04:09.860> I

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
slayer pieces while killing these but I

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.560 
slayer pieces while killing these but I
did<00:04:10.250> get<00:04:10.430> an<00:04:10.550> effigy<00:04:10.790> which<00:04:11.120> isn't<00:04:11.450> too

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
did get an effigy which isn't too

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.600 
did get an effigy which isn't too
surprising<00:04:11.720> because<00:04:12.350> these<00:04:12.980> monsters<00:04:13.430> are

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
surprising because these monsters are

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.030 
surprising because these monsters are
level<00:04:14.030> 180<00:04:14.930> and<00:04:15.230> you<00:04:15.290> can<00:04:15.440> kill<00:04:15.620> them<00:04:15.739> fairly

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
level 180 and you can kill them fairly

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.250 
level 180 and you can kill them fairly
fast<00:04:16.280> compared<00:04:16.760> to<00:04:16.850> most<00:04:17.000> other<00:04:17.239> level<00:04:17.690> 180

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
fast compared to most other level 180

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.870 
fast compared to most other level 180
monsters<00:04:18.769> so<00:04:19.250> they're<00:04:19.430> going<00:04:19.609> to<00:04:19.700> have<00:04:19.820> a

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
monsters so they're going to have a

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.550 
monsters so they're going to have a
pretty<00:04:20.120> high<00:04:20.330> drop<00:04:20.600> rate<00:04:20.810> of<00:04:20.900> effigies<00:04:21.320> since

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
pretty high drop rate of effigies since

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.590 
pretty high drop rate of effigies since
that<00:04:21.739> is<00:04:21.890> based<00:04:22.130> on<00:04:22.340> combat<00:04:22.760> level<00:04:22.880> so<00:04:23.479> it

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
that is based on combat level so it

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.940 
that is based on combat level so it
remains<00:04:23.870> to<00:04:23.990> be<00:04:24.020> seen<00:04:24.320> whether<00:04:24.500> this<00:04:24.740> is<00:04:24.919> a

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
remains to be seen whether this is a

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.280 
remains to be seen whether this is a
