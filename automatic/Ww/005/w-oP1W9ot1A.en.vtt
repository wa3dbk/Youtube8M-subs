00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
hard to tell necessarily when you have

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.359 
hard to tell necessarily when you have
these<00:01:46.070> wet<00:01:46.729> and<00:01:46.880> wavy<00:01:47.030> x'<00:01:48.010> what<00:01:49.010> its<00:01:49.220> gonna

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
these wet and wavy x' what its gonna

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.719 
these wet and wavy x' what its gonna
look<00:01:49.490> like<00:01:49.700> after<00:01:50.090> you<00:01:50.510> wash<00:01:50.780> it<00:01:51.080> okay<00:01:51.920> you<00:01:52.520> can

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
look like after you wash it okay you can

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.880 
look like after you wash it okay you can
see<00:01:52.940> it<00:01:53.030> online<00:01:53.180> but<00:01:53.990> you<00:01:54.200> don't<00:01:54.440> know<00:01:54.680> the

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
see it online but you don't know the

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.880 
see it online but you don't know the
scale<00:01:55.250> of<00:01:55.550> the<00:01:55.760> curl<00:01:56.229> this<00:01:57.229> is<00:01:57.440> one<00:01:57.619> of<00:01:57.770> these

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
scale of the curl this is one of these

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.139 
scale of the curl this is one of these
weaves

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
weaves

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.180 
weaves
that<00:01:59.990> I<00:02:00.229> really<00:02:00.530> thought<00:02:00.680> was<00:02:00.830> going<00:02:00.979> to<00:02:01.040> be<00:02:01.100> a

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
that I really thought was going to be a

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.810 
that I really thought was going to be a
little<00:02:01.430> bit<00:02:01.580> looser<00:02:02.290> than<00:02:03.290> it<00:02:03.470> actually<00:02:03.649> is

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
little bit looser than it actually is

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.139 
little bit looser than it actually is
I<00:02:04.850> looked<00:02:05.690> at<00:02:05.990> it<00:02:06.259> on<00:02:06.470> hair'<00:02:07.100> sisters<00:02:07.550> I<00:02:07.970> did

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
I looked at it on hair' sisters I did

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.029 
I looked at it on hair' sisters I did
not<00:02:08.450> purchase<00:02:08.690> it<00:02:08.989> from<00:02:09.140> her<00:02:09.350> sisters<00:02:09.739> but<00:02:09.979> I

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
not purchase it from her sisters but I

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.420 
not purchase it from her sisters but I
looked<00:02:10.489> at<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:10.940> photographs<00:02:11.510> and<00:02:12.400> when<00:02:13.400> I

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
looked at the photographs and when I

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.979 
looked at the photographs and when I
looked<00:02:13.670> at<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:13.910> photographs<00:02:14.420> I<00:02:14.690> really

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
looked at the photographs I really

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.170 
looked at the photographs I really
thought<00:02:15.170> it<00:02:15.320> would<00:02:15.380> be<00:02:15.560> quite<00:02:15.950> loose<00:02:16.370> but<00:02:17.030> when

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
thought it would be quite loose but when

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.870 
thought it would be quite loose but when
I<00:02:17.209> got<00:02:17.660> it<00:02:17.870> it<00:02:18.260> was<00:02:18.680> a<00:02:18.709> lot<00:02:18.950> tighter<00:02:19.310> so<00:02:19.670> I<00:02:19.700> have

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
I got it it was a lot tighter so I have

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:27.210 
I got it it was a lot tighter so I have
some<00:02:20.120> left<00:02:20.360> this<00:02:21.350> is<00:02:21.650> color<00:02:23.230> fr<00:02:25.060> 27<00:02:26.060> 6<00:02:26.360> 1-3

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
some left this is color fr 27 6 1-3

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.430 
some left this is color fr 27 6 1-3
there's<00:02:28.220> a<00:02:28.340> lot<00:02:28.700> more<00:02:29.140> 6<00:02:30.140> 1-3<00:02:30.590> in<00:02:30.920> here<00:02:31.390> than<00:02:32.440> 27

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
there's a lot more 6 1-3 in here than 27

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.190 
there's a lot more 6 1-3 in here than 27
and<00:02:33.680> this<00:02:34.430> is<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:34.670> curl<00:02:34.910> pattern<00:02:35.330> that<00:02:35.989> it

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
and this is the curl pattern that it

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.229 
and this is the curl pattern that it
takes<00:02:36.440> on<00:02:37.780> to<00:02:38.780> me<00:02:38.959> this<00:02:39.140> looks<00:02:39.350> more<00:02:40.000> more<00:02:41.000> like

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
takes on to me this looks more more like

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.710 
takes on to me this looks more more like
a<00:02:41.420> jheri<00:02:41.870> curl<00:02:42.190> than<00:02:43.190> what<00:02:43.730> I<00:02:43.760> was<00:02:44.000> expecting

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
a jheri curl than what I was expecting

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.920 
a jheri curl than what I was expecting
it's<00:02:44.930> not<00:02:45.170> super<00:02:45.650> brassy<00:02:46.340> this<00:02:47.299> is<00:02:47.450> not<00:02:47.630> very

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
it's not super brassy this is not very

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.780 
it's not super brassy this is not very
orange<00:02:48.440> 16<00:02:49.100> inches<00:02:49.489> this<00:02:50.120> is<00:02:50.180> color<00:02:51.280> 622<00:02:52.280> the

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
orange 16 inches this is color 622 the

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.340 
orange 16 inches this is color 622 the
color<00:02:53.030> six<00:02:53.600> and<00:02:53.900> 22<00:02:54.799> is<00:02:55.160> a<00:02:55.220> really<00:02:55.640> nice<00:02:55.850> blend

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
color six and 22 is a really nice blend

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:03.060 
color six and 22 is a really nice blend
it's<00:02:57.350> not<00:02:57.650> brassy<00:02:58.519> not<00:02:58.880> orange<00:02:59.390> II<00:02:59.600> at<00:03:00.160> all<00:03:01.510> and

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
it's not brassy not orange II at all and

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.949 
it's not brassy not orange II at all and
I<00:03:04.070> find<00:03:04.400> that<00:03:04.549> these<00:03:04.850> two<00:03:04.880> go<00:03:05.510> well<00:03:05.720> together

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
I find that these two go well together

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.870 
I find that these two go well together
and<00:03:06.440> usually<00:03:07.430> when<00:03:07.640> you<00:03:07.730> get<00:03:07.910> 16<00:03:08.420> inches

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
and usually when you get 16 inches

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.240 
and usually when you get 16 inches
usually<00:03:10.880> from<00:03:11.209> my<00:03:11.390> experience<00:03:12.019> is<00:03:12.200> 16<00:03:12.709> to<00:03:12.920> 18

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
usually from my experience is 16 to 18

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.170 
usually from my experience is 16 to 18
inches<00:03:13.610> okay<00:03:14.239> but<00:03:15.049> actually<00:03:15.739> this<00:03:16.190> going<00:03:17.090> to

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
inches okay but actually this going to

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.750 
inches okay but actually this going to
measure<00:03:17.390> it<00:03:17.690> here

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.360 

this<00:03:22.760> is<00:03:23.000> actually<00:03:23.450> 16<00:03:24.049> inches<00:03:24.409> stretched<00:03:24.920> so

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
this is actually 16 inches stretched so

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.710 
this is actually 16 inches stretched so
the<00:03:25.580> longest<00:03:26.180> piece<00:03:26.480> is<00:03:26.780> 16<00:03:27.260> inches<00:03:28.239> okay<00:03:29.239> it's

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
the longest piece is 16 inches okay it's

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.119 
the longest piece is 16 inches okay it's
not<00:03:29.870> 16<00:03:30.260> to<00:03:30.530> 18<00:03:31.120> this<00:03:32.120> is<00:03:32.180> a<00:03:32.569> true<00:03:32.930> 16<00:03:33.500> probably

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:34.129 
not 16 to 18 this is a true 16 probably

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:39.460 
not 16 to 18 this is a true 16 probably
14<00:03:34.670> to<00:03:35.180> 16<00:03:35.709> so<00:03:36.709> that<00:03:36.739> was<00:03:37.099> one<00:03:37.310> surprise<00:03:38.140> also<00:03:39.140> I

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
14 to 16 so that was one surprise also I

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.970 
14 to 16 so that was one surprise also I
have<00:03:40.190> quite<00:03:40.489> a<00:03:40.519> bit<00:03:40.700> of<00:03:40.790> experience<00:03:41.030> with

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
have quite a bit of experience with

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.559 
have quite a bit of experience with
human<00:03:42.980> hair<00:03:43.400> that's<00:03:43.670> been<00:03:43.879> bleached<00:03:44.180> and

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
human hair that's been bleached and

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.259 
human hair that's been bleached and
pumped<00:03:45.079> and<00:03:45.260> I<00:03:46.010> have<00:03:46.610> to<00:03:46.760> tell<00:03:46.909> you<00:03:47.060> this

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
pumped and I have to tell you this

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.890 
pumped and I have to tell you this
quality<00:03:47.900> is<00:03:48.079> very<00:03:48.440> very<00:03:48.739> good<00:03:49.010> it's<00:03:49.400> not<00:03:50.390> super

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
quality is very very good it's not super

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.710 
quality is very very good it's not super
soft<00:03:51.200> it's<00:03:51.500> not<00:03:51.590> super<00:03:52.099> course<00:03:52.430> it<00:03:53.180> feels

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
soft it's not super course it feels

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.930 
soft it's not super course it feels
exactly<00:03:54.260> what<00:03:54.739> you<00:03:54.859> would<00:03:55.010> expect<00:03:55.400> it<00:03:55.549> to<00:03:55.700> feel

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
exactly what you would expect it to feel

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.660 
exactly what you would expect it to feel
it<00:03:56.269> feels<00:03:57.019> like<00:03:57.230> naturally<00:03:58.129> curly<00:03:58.519> and

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
it feels like naturally curly and

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.119 
it feels like naturally curly and
there's<00:03:58.940> not<00:03:59.420> as<00:03:59.660> much<00:03:59.870> shedding<00:04:00.500> the<00:04:01.010> wefts

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:03.129 
there's not as much shedding the wefts

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:06.729 
there's not as much shedding the wefts
the<00:04:04.129> way<00:04:04.310> it's<00:04:04.519> on<00:04:04.790> here<00:04:05.180> it<00:04:05.450> seems<00:04:06.260> like<00:04:06.500> it's

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
the way it's on here it seems like it's

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.509 
the way it's on here it seems like it's
been<00:04:06.859> stitched<00:04:07.400> on<00:04:07.819> as<00:04:08.769> well<00:04:09.769> as<00:04:09.920> glued<00:04:10.280> in

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
been stitched on as well as glued in

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.210 
been stitched on as well as glued in
there<00:04:10.549> so<00:04:11.329> it's<00:04:11.629> not<00:04:11.780> just<00:04:11.840> stitched<00:04:12.500> in<00:04:12.769> it

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
there so it's not just stitched in it

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.520 
there so it's not just stitched in it
does<00:04:13.670> feel<00:04:13.940> like<00:04:13.970> there's<00:04:14.510> an<00:04:14.659> adhesive<00:04:15.049> as

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
does feel like there's an adhesive as

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.800 
does feel like there's an adhesive as
well<00:04:15.920> as<00:04:16.100> stitching<00:04:16.609> so<00:04:17.060> it's<00:04:17.359> on<00:04:17.570> there

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
well as stitching so it's on there

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:18.420 
well as stitching so it's on there
really<00:04:18.019> good

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
really good

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.090 
really good
which<00:04:19.430> means<00:04:20.229> there's<00:04:21.229> going<00:04:21.500> to<00:04:21.560> be<00:04:21.620> hardly

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
which means there's going to be hardly

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.029 
which means there's going to be hardly
any<00:04:22.220> shedding<00:04:22.789> and<00:04:22.940> I've<00:04:23.660> experienced<00:04:24.470> not

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039 
any shedding and I've experienced not

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:29.860 
any shedding and I've experienced not
very<00:04:25.310> much<00:04:25.520> shedding<00:04:26.979> from<00:04:27.979> this<00:04:28.220> wig<00:04:28.780> so<00:04:29.780> it

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
very much shedding from this wig so it

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.620 
very much shedding from this wig so it
is<00:04:29.960> very<00:04:30.229> good<00:04:30.410> quality<00:04:30.590> and<00:04:31.220> a<00:04:32.210> lot<00:04:32.419> of<00:04:32.539> the

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
is very good quality and a lot of the

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.820 
is very good quality and a lot of the
times<00:04:32.930> when<00:04:33.349> you<00:04:33.560> get<00:04:33.830> weave<00:04:34.760> that<00:04:35.300> is

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
times when you get weave that is

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.520 
times when you get weave that is
bleached<00:04:36.830> as<00:04:37.190> well<00:04:37.520> as<00:04:37.700> permed<00:04:38.090> there's<00:04:38.960> a<00:04:39.050> lot

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
bleached as well as permed there's a lot

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.250 
bleached as well as permed there's a lot
of<00:04:40.060> you<00:04:41.060> know<00:04:41.180> there<00:04:41.360> could<00:04:41.479> be<00:04:41.510> more<00:04:41.840> shedding

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
of you know there could be more shedding

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.909 
of you know there could be more shedding
than<00:04:42.440> the<00:04:42.560> regular<00:04:42.979> weave<00:04:43.160> and<00:04:44.289> the<00:04:45.289> quality

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
than the regular weave and the quality

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.879 
than the regular weave and the quality
of<00:04:46.310> the<00:04:46.940> hair<00:04:47.180> tends<00:04:47.539> to<00:04:47.720> be<00:04:47.870> over<00:04:48.349> processed

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 
of the hair tends to be over processed

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:52.420 
of the hair tends to be over processed
now<00:04:49.849> this<00:04:50.090> was<00:04:50.270> actually<00:04:50.449> quite<00:04:50.930> good<00:04:51.370> when<00:04:52.370> I

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
now this was actually quite good when I

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.050 
now this was actually quite good when I
bought<00:04:53.360> this<00:04:53.570> hair<00:04:53.870> for<00:04:54.199> this<00:04:54.410> week<00:04:54.650> it<00:04:55.190> turned

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
bought this hair for this week it turned

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.939 
bought this hair for this week it turned
out<00:04:56.240> to<00:04:56.479> be<00:04:56.510> a<00:04:56.630> lot<00:04:56.990> more<00:04:57.169> curly<00:04:57.650> than<00:04:57.830> I

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 
out to be a lot more curly than I

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:01.029 
out to be a lot more curly than I
expected<00:04:58.570> but<00:04:59.570> I<00:04:59.599> decided<00:05:00.020> to<00:05:00.199> use<00:05:00.470> it<00:05:00.500> and<00:05:00.800> I

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039 
expected but I decided to use it and I

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:03.339 
expected but I decided to use it and I
did<00:05:01.280> have<00:05:01.520> other<00:05:01.760> looser<00:05:02.360> weave<00:05:02.570> that<00:05:02.990> I<00:05:03.050> could

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:03.349 
did have other looser weave that I could

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:05.350 
did have other looser weave that I could
have<00:05:03.470> put<00:05:04.070> in<00:05:04.250> this<00:05:04.400> way<00:05:04.550> because<00:05:04.849> I<00:05:04.970> love<00:05:05.210> the

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
have put in this way because I love the

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.080 
have put in this way because I love the
color<00:05:05.630> and<00:05:05.810> the<00:05:06.110> curl<00:05:06.440> pattern<00:05:06.860> so<00:05:07.010> much<00:05:07.190> I<00:05:07.400> did

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
color and the curl pattern so much I did

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.650 
color and the curl pattern so much I did
decide<00:05:08.479> to<00:05:08.539> install<00:05:09.440> it<00:05:09.620> in<00:05:09.800> this<00:05:10.039> hair<00:05:10.660> to

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
decide to install it in this hair to

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.200 
decide to install it in this hair to
give<00:05:11.870> you<00:05:11.990> an<00:05:12.110> idea<00:05:12.260> of<00:05:12.560> the<00:05:12.889> scale<00:05:13.310> of<00:05:13.370> the

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
give you an idea of the scale of the

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.710 
give you an idea of the scale of the
curl<00:05:14.510> and<00:05:14.780> how<00:05:14.930> small<00:05:15.410> the<00:05:15.680> curl<00:05:15.919> is<00:05:16.570> parts<00:05:17.570> of

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
curl and how small the curl is parts of

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:24.430 
curl and how small the curl is parts of
the<00:05:17.960> wig<00:05:18.910> that<00:05:19.910> are<00:05:20.330> not<00:05:21.139> as<00:05:21.550> curly<00:05:22.550> as<00:05:23.440> the

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
the wig that are not as curly as the

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.330 
the wig that are not as curly as the
weave

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
weave

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.610 
weave
I<00:05:26.370> have<00:05:26.610> to<00:05:26.790> crimp<00:05:28.310> to<00:05:29.310> match<00:05:29.930> the<00:05:30.930> curl<00:05:31.199> and<00:05:31.470> if

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
I have to crimp to match the curl and if

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:37.340 
I have to crimp to match the curl and if
you<00:05:31.800> look<00:05:32.040> here<00:05:33.139> the<00:05:34.139> crimping<00:05:34.650> parts<00:05:36.350> right

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 
you look here the crimping parts right

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.320 
you look here the crimping parts right
blend<00:05:37.949> really<00:05:38.310> well<00:05:38.990> with<00:05:39.990> the<00:05:40.680> curl<00:05:40.979> pattern

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
blend really well with the curl pattern

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.409 
blend really well with the curl pattern
so<00:05:42.330> if<00:05:43.229> to<00:05:43.919> give<00:05:44.100> you<00:05:44.220> an<00:05:44.310> idea<00:05:44.430> of<00:05:44.669> exactly<00:05:44.910> how

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:45.419 
so if to give you an idea of exactly how

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:48.590 
so if to give you an idea of exactly how
small<00:05:45.750> the<00:05:45.960> curl<00:05:46.169> is<00:05:46.550> that's<00:05:47.550> how<00:05:47.820> small<00:05:48.120> the

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 
small the curl is that's how small the

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.689 
small the curl is that's how small the
curl<00:05:48.810> is<00:05:49.020> it's<00:05:49.410> not<00:05:49.590> something<00:05:50.070> that<00:05:50.250> you<00:05:50.490> can

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699 
curl is it's not something that you can

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:53.570 
curl is it's not something that you can
use<00:05:50.850> a<00:05:50.880> curling<00:05:51.389> iron<00:05:51.600> to<00:05:52.010> replicate<00:05:53.010> I<00:05:53.160> really

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
use a curling iron to replicate I really

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.550 
use a curling iron to replicate I really
had<00:05:53.760> to<00:05:53.790> use<00:05:54.060> a<00:05:54.090> crimping<00:05:54.570> iron<00:05:54.750> to<00:05:55.020> match<00:05:55.229> the

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
had to use a crimping iron to match the

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.210 
had to use a crimping iron to match the
rest<00:05:55.770> of<00:05:56.010> the<00:05:56.540> hair<00:05:57.540> this<00:05:58.500> crimper<00:05:59.040> has

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 
rest of the hair this crimper has

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.610 
rest of the hair this crimper has
rounded<00:05:59.669> edges<00:05:59.820> for<00:06:00.419> more<00:06:00.600> of<00:06:00.690> a<00:06:00.810> wave<00:06:01.020> unlike

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
rounded edges for more of a wave unlike

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.050 
rounded edges for more of a wave unlike
the<00:06:01.770> old<00:06:01.919> school<00:06:02.220> ones<00:06:02.430> which<00:06:02.700> are<00:06:02.880> more

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
the old school ones which are more

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.860 
the old school ones which are more
jagged<00:06:03.330> and<00:06:03.660> sharp<00:06:03.780> and<00:06:04.940> I<00:06:05.940> did<00:06:06.240> put<00:06:06.660> the

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
jagged and sharp and I did put the

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:12.500 
jagged and sharp and I did put the
darker<00:06:08.630> 6:22<00:06:10.340> underneath<00:06:11.340> to<00:06:12.210> give<00:06:12.389> it

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:12.510 
darker 6:22 underneath to give it

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:17.330 
darker 6:22 underneath to give it
dimension<00:06:12.660> and<00:06:13.430> then<00:06:14.430> 27-6<00:06:15.330> 1/3<00:06:15.780> on<00:06:15.900> top<00:06:16.229> and<00:06:16.560> I

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
dimension and then 27-6 1/3 on top and I

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:23.090 
dimension and then 27-6 1/3 on top and I
did<00:06:17.610> add<00:06:17.880> a<00:06:17.910> route<00:06:18.419> to<00:06:19.820> the<00:06:20.820> weave<00:06:21.210> as<00:06:21.479> well<00:06:22.100> the

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.100 
did add a route to the weave as well the

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.860 
did add a route to the weave as well the
wig<00:06:23.370> that<00:06:23.400> I<00:06:23.580> installed<00:06:24.030> it<00:06:24.150> in<00:06:24.270> was<00:06:24.449> a<00:06:24.479> Janet

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
wig that I installed it in was a Janet

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.250 
wig that I installed it in was a Janet
wave<00:06:25.020> also<00:06:25.370> 27-6<00:06:26.370> 1/3<00:06:26.729> so<00:06:27.510> these<00:06:27.780> actually

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.260 
wave also 27-6 1/3 so these actually

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.830 
wave also 27-6 1/3 so these actually
blended<00:06:29.130> really<00:06:29.310> well<00:06:29.490> I<00:06:29.940> did<00:06:30.330> not<00:06:30.479> have<00:06:30.690> to

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 
blended really well I did not have to

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.800 
blended really well I did not have to
dye<00:06:31.020> the<00:06:31.080> weave<00:06:31.380> which<00:06:31.860> is<00:06:32.010> a<00:06:32.039> bonus<00:06:32.389> all<00:06:33.389> I<00:06:33.450> did

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:33.810 
dye the weave which is a bonus all I did

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.200 
dye the weave which is a bonus all I did
was<00:06:34.080> add<00:06:34.320> a<00:06:34.380> root<00:06:34.860> and<00:06:35.039> installed<00:06:35.580> it<00:06:35.760> into<00:06:36.060> my

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
was add a root and installed it into my

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.960 
was add a root and installed it into my
wig<00:06:36.419> and<00:06:36.690> this<00:06:37.500> is<00:06:37.800> not<00:06:38.100> the<00:06:38.340> type<00:06:38.550> of<00:06:38.580> hair
