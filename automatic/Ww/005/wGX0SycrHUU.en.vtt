usually double that recipe and I make

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.619 
usually double that recipe and I make
that<00:05:17.169> fin<00:05:18.129> so<00:05:18.310> that<00:05:18.400> I<00:05:18.520> can<00:05:18.729> just<00:05:18.940> bottle<00:05:19.360> it<00:05:19.509> up

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:19.629 
that fin so that I can just bottle it up

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:26.260 
that fin so that I can just bottle it up
and<00:05:19.870> use<00:05:19.990> it<00:05:20.139> whenever<00:05:20.259> I<00:05:20.470> need<00:05:20.650> to

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.950
