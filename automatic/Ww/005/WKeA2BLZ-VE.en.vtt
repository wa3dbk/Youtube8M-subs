00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:32.340
 the tape art of max that does not need light 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.050
 to be protected at night 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.420
 artist gets on the road 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.100
 his favorite place to act are the 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.910
 lampposts of your city 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.910
 Amsterdam 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.510
 advisor is not your real name without 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.820
 However, he wants to act anonymously 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.680
 because legally his art is also 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.140
 a vandalic act 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.880
 for me it is a way to leave a mark on a 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.220
 place that I like a lot 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.910
 other people leave marks on a tree or 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:08.230
 something like that I hang these things as they see 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.230
 at night it is very beautiful 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:19.120
 max storm does not use anything other than tape 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.120
 normal packing adhesive and current 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.650
 the young artist hits one after the other 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.010
 layers of tape to a plate 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:34.100
 plexiglass then cut out each layer 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:37.100
 giving it the shape you want until at 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.810
 final gets an artistic piece made 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.810
 with a daily material 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.140
 the tape seems an unusual medium 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.440
 for art but it has some effects 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.260
 incredible when combined with light 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.240
 having the light behind the different 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:00.260
 layers of tape create a strange 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:03.410
 depth with which you can work 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:06.530
 max distributes his works throughout Amsterdam 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.570
 even in front of his studio everything 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.200
 what you need to work is a crystal 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.970
 and light began to experiment with tape 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.250
 Adhesive in 2011 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.230
 since then marks forn has been very 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.770
 productive creating very varied works 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.490
 from small stickers to pieces of 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.490
 larger format 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.040
 how they see the light is very important without the 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.980
 light this is nothing but plexiglass 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.140
 with one more thing will break day but 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.060
 lift it and light it from behind 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.060
 the ribbon unfolds its magic 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:49.080
 max stern never studied art discovered 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.510
 by chance the light effect of the 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.580
 adhesive tape and saw that sepia tone 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.240
 he lent himself very well to his motives 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.240
 preferred 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.810
 I was always passionate about the authors of the 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.810
 called lost generation 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.680
 as hemingway steinberg or salinger the 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.540
 way they sketched their characters 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:17.519
 torn apart moving down the thin line 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.519
 between fame and failure 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:23.799
 the works of max storm can already be seen 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.409
 in the streets of many cities 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:29.349
 European the former student of sociology 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:33.090
 and psychology has aroused the interest of 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:33.090
 galleries and art collectors 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.600
 his large- format works are already sold 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.600
 for several thousand euros 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.569
 max thorne still prefers to work in 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.030
 the street has even called 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:59.500
 online so that your stickers are 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.500
 stick around the world 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.220
 this is a good example of the kind of 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.080
 stickers that I send to people all over 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.630
 the world 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.030
 for me it is a way to spread my 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.510
 urban art and people are free to 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:22.590
 stick them on lampposts all over the planet 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:25.940
 and hawaii the angels argentina-japan in 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.770
 any place that request it 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.930
 currently the works of macsa zorn are 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:34.100
 can appreciate in the festival of light 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.100
 from amsterdam
