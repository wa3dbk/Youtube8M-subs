method by going and going ahead and

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.440 
method by going and going ahead and
starting<00:05:12.440> assembly<00:05:12.920> and<00:05:13.210> bringing<00:05:14.210> in<00:05:14.330> those

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
starting assembly and bringing in those

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.060 
starting assembly and bringing in those

kits so you can put them together here
and<00:05:16.190> I<00:05:16.250> think<00:05:16.460> that's<00:05:16.610> what<00:05:16.730> we<00:05:16.820> opted<00:05:17.150> to<00:05:17.240> do

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.390 
and I think that's what we opted to do

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.600 
and I think that's what we opted to do
it<00:05:18.140> seemed<00:05:18.350> to<00:05:18.440> be<00:05:18.530> the<00:05:18.680> most<00:05:18.950> direct<00:05:19.340> route<00:05:19.550> to

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
it seemed to be the most direct route to

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.300 
it seemed to be the most direct route to
make<00:05:19.940> our<00:05:20.090> bikes<00:05:20.300> more<00:05:20.570> accessible<00:05:21.110> and<00:05:21.310> you
