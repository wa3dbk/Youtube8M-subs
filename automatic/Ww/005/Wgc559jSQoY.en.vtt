00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:07.859
 all the waters of the sea hello now at least 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:10.679
 disassemble such a topic how to get rid of 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:14.309
 squeak and crunch between torpedo polo 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.740
 sedan and windshield many climbed 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.140
 forum he watched the video in principle 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.820
 I have not found such a sum of such 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.000
 the only thing here on the forums saw what 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.460
 people sticks in this space 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.760
 all there rags and noise insulation and so 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.610
 further generally decided to check it was 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.890
 me sheet like splenitis 7 millimeters 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.820
 on the one hand was foil in 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.489
 Generally I thrust you in half 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:44.629
 checked in principle it helps but there is 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.270
 one such problem is that the design 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:51.719
 the shape of the torpedo is made so that most 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:57.239
 edge distance to glass is less than 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.859
 deeper that is if you shove something in there 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.379
 on some kind of sound insulation if it is 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.570
 hanging around here it will work if 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.510
 cavities there drown then there she is no longer 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.130
 doesn't get into a torpedo and that is 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.320
 there is no effect anymore she's just 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.830
 fails there and creak as well 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.420
 Well and dark 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.659
 glass outside side 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.540
 made slightly lower than the torpedo that is 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.860
 if you have 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.770
 insulation here is a little truth as 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.530
 would make her even right edge then from the street 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:33.509
 c all the same it will be clearly visible 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.220
 Well, that's just an ordinary farm stand did 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.060
 in principle, but it can also be somehow 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.970
 parts of the collective farm but not so noticeable in general 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.210
 I bought in the auto parts store here 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:51.890
 such a seal is a seal 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:55.170
 doors for the VAZ 2107 about consists of 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.610
 such lower part in general which 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.670
 puts on the body itself 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:03.450
 There some aluminum inserts but not 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.869
 the essence and here's the airbag rubber itself in general I 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.729
 snapped this pillow over here 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.240
 the edge here and so with a knife from two sides 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.820
 cut off 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.620
 superfluous burrs congratulated everything 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.380
 Naturally that was neat and all 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.360
 look at this section you can see that if 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.870
 cut it there you will have a semi-circular 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.240
 the form 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:28.980
 it is pretty smooth 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:31.330
 cut off the desired length of this seal and 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.910
 just the same part 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:38.410
 which puts on the door just there and 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:41.770
 and stuck but thrust so that the edge of 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.950
 I stayed outside 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:48.610
 so that the torpedo was vraspor got up with 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.970
 glass in general I can say but it 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:55.020
 help i got rid of all the squeaks there 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:58.900
 the third day is now on the street minus 12 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.710
 when heated with a torpedo stove nothing 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.880
 crunches 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:05.800
 that is, tried it all things there to stagger 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.900
 before it was enough just to take there 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.450
 for air of water or for a visor just 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.520
 to shake it was a terrible load such 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.040
 the script on each bump all crunched 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.860
 creaked 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.650
 a lot of things like Lada I donâ€™t know 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.860
 how long will it last when 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.090
 while it all works 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.320
 maybe if someone has any 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.310
 other options 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:33.100
 someone came up with something more interesting 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:35.790
 write in the comments will be glad it all 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.670
 try to test 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.470
 while in general something like this 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.080
 everything is visible or not 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.320
 just remains such a small edging 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.990
 black almost blends with 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:53.850
 a torpedo from the street is also not in principle 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.850
 no farm now show 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:05.650
 in practice this is an invisible strip well 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:12.750
 no one even notices you know what's there 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:12.750
 something you shove the cabin the same 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.890
 no one here how many people drove fires not 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:24.280
 I only paid attention to this 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.680
 I look because I know, but this is already in 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.400
 basically used 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.400
 thank you all
