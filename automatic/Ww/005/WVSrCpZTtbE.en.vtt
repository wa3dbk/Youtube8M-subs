00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
do it before you kill the boss but if

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.240 
do it before you kill the boss but if
you<00:00:57.449> can<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:58.350> would<00:00:58.379> just<00:00:58.590> take<00:00:58.739> forever<00:00:59.039> to

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
you can that would just take forever to

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.380 
you can that would just take forever to
why<00:00:59.579> are<00:00:59.640> you<00:00:59.730> getting<00:00:59.910> hit<00:01:00.000> by<00:01:00.030> all<00:01:00.239> those

guys<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.809> just<00:01:00.840> decided<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.739> end<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.949> pole

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190

there of this pool I get fairly close to

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.730 
there of this pool I get fairly close to
dying<00:01:05.100> as<00:01:05.519> probably<00:01:05.820> because<00:01:06.000> they<00:01:06.119> didn't

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
dying as probably because they didn't

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.140 
dying as probably because they didn't
use<00:01:07.740> any<00:01:07.920> potions<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.430> here's<00:01:08.640> here's<00:01:08.939> another
