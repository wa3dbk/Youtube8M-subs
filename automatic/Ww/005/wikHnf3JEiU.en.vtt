00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.379 

I'm<00:00:01.800> just<00:00:01.920> trying<00:00:02.040> to<00:00:02.190> think<00:00:02.250> of<00:00:02.429> the<00:00:02.460> easiest

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
I'm just trying to think of the easiest

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.269 
I'm just trying to think of the easiest
way<00:00:03.510> to<00:00:03.570> do<00:00:03.780> this<00:00:03.810> with<00:00:04.110> three<00:00:04.380> because<00:00:05.130> I<00:00:05.220> know

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
way to do this with three because I know

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:06.769 
way to do this with three because I know
it's<00:00:05.640> possible<00:00:05.850> with<00:00:06.180> three<00:00:06.390> because<00:00:06.569> when<00:00:06.660> we

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
it's possible with three because when we

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.709 
it's possible with three because when we
did<00:00:06.930> it<00:00:07.049> before<00:00:07.610> we<00:00:08.610> still<00:00:08.910> had<00:00:09.120> one<00:00:09.360> on<00:00:09.630> the

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
did it before we still had one on the

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.390 
did it before we still had one on the
other<00:00:09.750> side<00:00:10.139> of<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.380> stairs<00:00:10.620> and<00:00:10.769> we<00:00:10.980> all<00:00:11.190> were

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
other side of the stairs and we all were

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.070 
other side of the stairs and we all were
on<00:00:11.519> pylons<00:00:12.000> so<00:00:12.240> technically<00:00:12.570> that<00:00:12.809> basically

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
on pylons so technically that basically

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.289 
on pylons so technically that basically
means<00:00:13.259> you<00:00:13.380> only<00:00:13.920> need<00:00:14.130> three<00:00:14.370> because<00:00:15.059> if<00:00:15.179> you

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
means you only need three because if you

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:24.130 
means you only need three because if you
only<00:00:15.389> want<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.809> go<00:00:15.900> across<00:00:16.109> right

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.349 

oh<00:00:24.199> yeah<00:00:24.949> yeah<00:00:25.099> if<00:00:25.160> it's<00:00:25.340> just<00:00:25.490> weak<00:00:25.670> yeah<00:00:26.119> but

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:26.359 
oh yeah yeah if it's just weak yeah but

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.120 
oh yeah yeah if it's just weak yeah but
you<00:00:26.480> can't<00:00:26.750> one<00:00:26.990> man<00:00:27.199> this<00:00:27.380> part<00:00:27.680> to<00:00:27.920> get<00:00:28.009> the
