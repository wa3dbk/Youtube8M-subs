and<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:16.950> think<00:01:17.250> they've<00:01:17.460> got<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.670> good<00:01:17.909> chance<00:01:18.180> of

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:18.329 
and I think they've got a good chance of

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:19.819 
and I think they've got a good chance of
beating<00:01:18.479> predominant<00:01:19.229> British<00:01:19.500> Dortmund

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:19.829

been a bit of a surprise in the
Bundesliga<00:01:30.780> this<00:01:30.930> year<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.770> it's<00:01:32.490> gonna<00:01:32.579> be

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
Bundesliga this year so it's gonna be

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.010 
Bundesliga this year so it's gonna be
interesting<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.210> see<00:01:33.299> what<00:01:33.450> happens<00:01:33.719> there<00:01:33.899> as

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
interesting to see what happens there as

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.279 
interesting to see what happens there as
well<00:01:34.700> this<00:01:35.700> season<00:01:36.270> British<00:01:36.810> Adam<00:01:37.020> has<00:01:37.200> been

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
well this season British Adam has been

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:39.410 
well this season British Adam has been
very<00:01:37.530> very<00:01:37.799> poor<00:01:38.250> in<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.549> Bundesliga<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.149> I

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
very very poor in the Bundesliga and I

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.120 
very very poor in the Bundesliga and I
think<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.719> European<00:01:40.289> campaign<00:01:40.710> has<00:01:40.859> really

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
think the European campaign has really

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.499 
think the European campaign has really

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
games needing to pick up points so I

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.690

think with the home advantage and with

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.370 
think with the home advantage and with
the<00:02:49.910> greater<00:02:50.390> need<00:02:50.690> I'm<00:02:50.990> actually<00:02:51.110> going<00:02:51.320> to
