person might want to replace the fine

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.299 
person might want to replace the fine
tuner<00:00:45.870> one<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.469> because<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.129> may<00:00:47.280> be

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
tuner one is because it may be

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.360 
tuner one is because it may be
malfunctioning<00:00:48.000> or<00:00:48.570> they<00:00:49.410> want<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.710> just<00:00:49.920> make

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
malfunctioning or they want to just make

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.729 
malfunctioning or they want to just make
let's<00:00:50.579> say<00:00:50.670> they<00:00:50.820> have<00:00:51.000> four<00:00:51.660> fine<00:00:51.960> tuners<00:00:52.440> and

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
let's say they have four fine tuners and

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.850 
let's say they have four fine tuners and
they<00:00:53.670> want<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.210> just<00:00:54.960> have<00:00:55.110> one<00:00:55.350> fine<00:00:55.590> tuner<00:00:55.800> on

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
they want to just have one fine tuner on

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.560 
they want to just have one fine tuner on
the<00:00:55.980> e<00:00:56.010> so<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.610> might<00:00:56.820> want<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.180> take<00:00:57.420> off

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
the e so that I might want to take off

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.500 
the e so that I might want to take off
these<00:00:58.250> but<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.280> think<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.670> easiest<00:00:59.699> thing<00:01:00.270> if

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
these but I think the easiest thing if

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.880 
these but I think the easiest thing if
you're<00:01:00.629> not<00:01:00.780> familiar<00:01:00.989> taking<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.590> violin

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
you're not familiar taking a violin

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.770 
you're not familiar taking a violin
apart<00:01:02.190> probably<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.670> best<00:01:03.270> thing<00:01:03.449> for<00:01:03.510> you

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
apart probably the best thing for you

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.960 
apart probably the best thing for you
the<00:01:03.899> best<00:01:04.080> rule<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.409> thumb<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.769> just<00:01:05.489> do<00:01:05.640> one

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
the best rule of thumb is just do one

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.210 
the best rule of thumb is just do one
string<00:01:06.390> at<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.630> time<00:01:06.659> now<00:01:07.500> if<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.710> was<00:01:07.830> me<00:01:08.040> I

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
string at a time now if it was me I

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.010 
string at a time now if it was me I
would<00:01:08.250> disassemble<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.150> whole<00:01:09.180> violin<00:01:09.780> and

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
would disassemble the whole violin and

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.050 
would disassemble the whole violin and
then<00:01:10.229> reassemble<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.010> with<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.760> amount<00:01:12.000> of

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
then reassemble it with the amount of

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.399 
then reassemble it with the amount of
fine<00:01:12.240> tuners<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.689> want<00:01:12.960> if<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.140> wanted<00:01:13.350> to

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
fine tuners that I want if I wanted to

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.810 
fine tuners that I want if I wanted to
remove<00:01:13.530> three<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.159> them<00:01:14.280> or<00:01:14.369> whatever<00:01:14.490> but

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
remove three of them or whatever but

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.310 
remove three of them or whatever but
that<00:01:15.570> requires<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.049> little<00:01:16.110> bit<00:01:16.229> more

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
that requires a little bit more

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.800 
that requires a little bit more
experience<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:18.119> can<00:01:18.330> kind<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.540> run<00:01:18.689> into

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
experience and you can kind of run into

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.570 
experience and you can kind of run into
some<00:01:19.049> issues<00:01:19.200> if<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.560> do<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:20.070> am<00:01:20.280> going<00:01:20.520> to

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
quick and easy way to do it just one

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.830 
quick and easy way to do it just one
string<00:01:26.070> at<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.250> time<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:27.119> it's<00:01:27.330> as<00:01:27.450> easy<00:01:27.659> as

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
string at a time so it's as easy as

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.980 
string at a time so it's as easy as
possible<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:28.979> here<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:29.850> have<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.150> violin<00:01:30.720> let's

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
possible so here I have a violin let's

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.770 
possible so here I have a violin let's
pretend<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:32.070> fine<00:01:32.909> tuner<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.329> stripped<00:01:33.630> out

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
pretend this fine tuner is stripped out

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.480 
pretend this fine tuner is stripped out
it<00:01:33.930> doesn't<00:01:34.079> work<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.159> first<00:01:35.340> thing<00:01:35.430> I'm

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
it doesn't work so the first thing I'm

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.530 
it doesn't work so the first thing I'm
going<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.640> do<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:35.850> I'm<00:01:36.000> just<00:01:36.060> going<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.360> loosen

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
going to do is I'm just going to loosen

parts that you have to be concerned
about<00:01:45.990> one<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.369> have<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.729> screw<00:01:48.030> portion

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
about one is you have the screw portion

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.749 
about one is you have the screw portion
here<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:48.840> then<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.350> have<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.530> nut

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
here and then you have a nut

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.999 
here and then you have a nut
those<00:01:51.210> are<00:01:51.450> both<00:01:51.659> threaded<00:01:52.409> items<00:01:52.799> that

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
those are both threaded items that

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.039 
those are both threaded items that
you'll<00:01:53.130> be<00:01:53.310> dealing<00:01:53.640> with<00:01:53.670> so<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.810> screw

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
you'll be dealing with so this screw

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
comes right out pretty easy and then I'm

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.699 
comes right out pretty easy and then I'm
going<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.640> loosen<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:09.869> nut<00:02:10.440> right<00:02:10.679> here

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
going to loosen this nut right here

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.670 
going to loosen this nut right here
again

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
nut and we're going to turn it clockwise

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.099 
nut and we're going to turn it clockwise
going<00:03:33.069> to<00:03:33.129> turn<00:03:33.250> it<00:03:33.340> to<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:33.459> right<00:03:33.699> and

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
going to turn it to the right and

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.119 
going to turn it to the right and
tighten<00:03:35.109> it<00:03:35.169> now<00:03:35.349> this<00:03:35.530> is<00:03:35.709> going<00:03:35.859> to<00:03:35.919> make

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129 
tighten it now this is going to make

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:41.219 
tighten it now this is going to make
this<00:03:37.090> fine<00:03:37.599> tuner<00:03:38.879> type<00:03:39.879> with<00:03:40.870> your<00:03:41.019> tail

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:41.229 
this fine tuner type with your tail

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:42.569 
this fine tuner type with your tail
piece<00:03:41.470> so<00:03:41.650> it<00:03:41.739> doesn't<00:03:41.949> buzz<00:03:42.129> and<00:03:42.340> move<00:03:42.459> around

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
piece so it doesn't buzz and move around

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:44.640 
piece so it doesn't buzz and move around
so<00:03:43.479> I'm<00:03:43.569> going<00:03:43.689> to<00:03:43.720> get<00:03:43.840> finger<00:03:44.199> tight<00:03:44.439> and

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
so I'm going to get finger tight and

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.710 
so I'm going to get finger tight and
then<00:03:44.949> I'm<00:03:45.069> going<00:03:45.220> to<00:03:45.310> use<00:03:45.430> my<00:03:45.609> pliers<00:03:45.939> now<00:03:46.389> the

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
then I'm going to use my pliers now the

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.229 
then I'm going to use my pliers now the
pliers<00:03:47.049> a<00:03:47.199> little<00:03:47.500> dangerous<00:03:47.949> if<00:03:48.489> you<00:03:48.759> really

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
pliers a little dangerous if you really

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:50.789 
pliers a little dangerous if you really
reef<00:03:49.599> on<00:03:49.840> it<00:03:50.019> you<00:03:50.229> know<00:03:50.319> you're<00:03:50.590> going<00:03:50.739> to

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
reef on it you know you're going to

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.770 
reef on it you know you're going to
going<00:03:51.430> to<00:03:51.459> break<00:03:51.669> your<00:03:51.819> tail<00:03:52.030> piece<00:03:52.299> they<00:03:52.569> just

going to break your tail piece they just
be<00:03:52.930> careful<00:03:53.349> if<00:03:53.409> you<00:03:53.500> do<00:03:53.650> decide<00:03:53.919> to<00:03:54.099> use

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
be careful if you do decide to use

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.509 
be careful if you do decide to use
pliers<00:03:54.699> so<00:03:55.599> the<00:03:55.840> general<00:03:56.199> rule<00:03:56.229> is<00:03:56.650> is<00:03:56.949> about<00:03:57.489> a

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
pliers so the general rule is is about a

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.610 
pliers so the general rule is is about a
quarter<00:03:58.000> turn<00:03:58.209> after<00:03:58.629> finger-tight<00:03:59.229> about<00:03:59.590> a

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
quarter turn after finger-tight about a

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.039 
quarter turn after finger-tight about a
quarter<00:04:00.099> turn<00:04:00.340> and<00:04:00.699> that's<00:04:01.299> all<00:04:01.540> you<00:04:01.689> have<00:04:01.720> to

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
quarter turn and that's all you have to

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:04.110 
quarter turn and that's all you have to
do<00:04:02.199> maybe<00:04:02.799> a<00:04:02.949> third<00:04:03.280> turn<00:04:03.609> at<00:04:03.790> the<00:04:03.909> most

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
do maybe a third turn at the most

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.550 
do maybe a third turn at the most
depending<00:04:04.509> on<00:04:04.569> how<00:04:04.750> tight<00:04:05.049> you<00:04:05.199> got<00:04:05.319> it<00:04:05.439> when

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
depending on how tight you got it when

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.589 
depending on how tight you got it when
you<00:04:05.590> did<00:04:05.829> finger<00:04:06.310> tight<00:04:06.519> but<00:04:06.819> if<00:04:07.239> you<00:04:07.359> do<00:04:07.479> it

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 
you did finger tight but if you do it

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:09.270 
you did finger tight but if you do it
any<00:04:07.720> more<00:04:07.810> you<00:04:08.199> risk<00:04:08.409> cracking<00:04:08.769> your<00:04:09.099> tail

any more you risk cracking your tail
piece<00:04:09.519> and<00:04:09.729> then<00:04:09.819> you<00:04:09.909> get<00:04:10.000> to<00:04:10.120> buying

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
piece and then you get to buying

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.599 
piece and then you get to buying
utilities<00:04:10.810> so<00:04:11.049> no<00:04:11.859> more<00:04:12.040> than<00:04:12.159> a<00:04:12.220> quarter<00:04:12.459> turn

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:12.609 
utilities so no more than a quarter turn

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:15.059 
utilities so no more than a quarter turn
and<00:04:12.759> you<00:04:13.060> want<00:04:13.329> it<00:04:13.419> nice<00:04:13.569> and<00:04:13.629> snug<00:04:13.930> because<00:04:14.919> if

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
it's not it'll get loose in the near

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.539 
it's not it'll get loose in the near
future<00:04:17.259> and<00:04:17.560> it'll<00:04:17.769> buzz<00:04:17.949> and<00:04:18.099> rattle<00:04:18.430> while

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.170 
we're going to tighten the string and if

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.630 
we're going to tighten the string and if
you've<00:04:38.290> watched<00:04:38.530> any<00:04:38.800> of<00:04:38.890> my<00:04:38.980> videos<00:04:39.040> on<00:04:39.610> how

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
you've watched any of my videos on how

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.740 
you've watched any of my videos on how
to<00:04:40.380> replace<00:04:41.380> strings<00:04:42.070> you'll<00:04:42.850> know<00:04:43.120> that<00:04:43.150> the

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
to replace strings you'll know that the

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.440 
to replace strings you'll know that the
best<00:04:43.960> way<00:04:44.110> to<00:04:44.260> put<00:04:44.650> a<00:04:44.710> string<00:04:45.070> on<00:04:45.220> the<00:04:45.610> peg<00:04:45.880> so

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
best way to put a string on the peg so

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.110 
best way to put a string on the peg so
the<00:04:46.540> pay<00:04:46.720> doesn't<00:04:47.050> slip<00:04:47.290> is<00:04:47.560> by<00:04:48.340> directing<00:04:49.030> the

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
the pay doesn't slip is by directing the

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.300 
the pay doesn't slip is by directing the
string<00:04:49.420> over<00:04:49.690> towards<00:04:50.500> the<00:04:50.590> peg<00:04:50.920> that<00:04:51.160> you're

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
string over towards the peg that you're

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.620 
string over towards the peg that you're
turning<00:04:51.520> and<00:04:51.930> so<00:04:52.930> it<00:04:53.890> wins<00:04:54.670> against<00:04:55.330> the<00:04:55.420> side

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
turning and so it wins against the side

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.170 
turning and so it wins against the side
of<00:04:55.660> the<00:04:55.810> scroll<00:04:56.050> box<00:04:56.260> here<00:04:56.500> so<00:04:56.940> I'm<00:04:57.940> going<00:04:58.120> to

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
of the scroll box here so I'm going to

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.090 
of the scroll box here so I'm going to
push<00:04:58.390> the<00:04:58.540> peg<00:04:58.750> in<00:04:58.930> gently<00:04:59.320> while<00:04:59.530> I<00:04:59.560> turn<00:04:59.920> it

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
push the peg in gently while I turn it

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.910 
push the peg in gently while I turn it
and<00:05:00.540> direct<00:05:01.540> that<00:05:01.690> string<00:05:02.080> over<00:05:02.290> so<00:05:02.800> it's

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:02.920 
and direct that string over so it's

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.340
