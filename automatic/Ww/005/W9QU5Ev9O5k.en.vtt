 Yes everyone this evening is often difficult to hear the horn button 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:12.910
 I would like to introduce because the home button can be added by software as a measure . 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:19.320
 All the functions of the home button are listed like this 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.260
 Good evening 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:33.809
 It is a method of setting well, but there is also a setting called 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:35.500
 After setting, press this General then you will come out with information, usage etc. 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.310
 In 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:45.040
 This is tap access 4 bt 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:48.730
 Well, if it is such a zoom function or text is displayed in large letters 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:53.199
 I'm out of it and it's automatic text reading 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:55.520
 The lower back and forth function support foot stay part touch 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:01:02.470
 I 'll tap the word 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:05.690
 After so comes out of that leg stay part touch you'll turn on the guy 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.960
 It found And then of this came out 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:13.240
 This has disappeared 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:17.880
 You can now put the home button on the screen 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:21.030
 No matter which software you use, wrap it in the foreground 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:27.810
 I think you can use the same way as the home button 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:32.579
 If there is that multi-touch function as a target by another feature and this is called something 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.270
 Is n't it a lot of coffee or soft I think that I always come back with the home button 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.590
 but 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.870
 You can return to the other even once people by the use of this multi-standing trees 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.610
 Five 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:46.510
 You can get the product button just by breaking the school with your finger in the middle 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:52.180
 In Are is a history in 4 c or to the home end not you come out 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:57.860
 Than when you want to put this guy this guy come out with a package on the four fingers 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:02:00.130
 Well such a function is also useful You can switch the application just by doing yellow sand with four fingers 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.130
 I will 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:07.880
 There is no need to use this button 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:13.750
 It looks like something is not cool or recommended here 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.750
 So this Subscribe thank you today 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.720
