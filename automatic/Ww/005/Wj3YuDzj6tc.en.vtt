00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
feel we also use cameras that can detect

heat sources as well and it also

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.460 
heat sources as well and it also

you<00:02:30.400> would<00:02:30.550> not<00:02:30.700> expect<00:02:30.760> we<00:02:31.360> try<00:02:31.600> and<00:02:31.840> measure

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
you would not expect we try and measure

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.770 
you would not expect we try and measure
the<00:02:32.470> risk<00:02:32.740> to<00:02:33.220> firefighters<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.330> case<00:02:34.510> like

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
the risk to firefighters the case like

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.170 
the risk to firefighters the case like
this<00:02:34.990> initially<00:02:35.320> we<00:02:36.160> knew<00:02:36.340> we<00:02:36.520> had<00:02:36.550> victims

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
this initially we knew we had victims

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.449 
this initially we knew we had victims
and<00:02:37.420> so<00:02:37.600> the<00:02:37.720> firefighters<00:02:38.320> are<00:02:38.530> literally

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
and so the firefighters are literally

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.670 
and so the firefighters are literally
risking<00:02:39.910> their<00:02:40.120> lives<00:02:40.330> to<00:02:40.600> go<00:02:40.840> in<00:02:41.050> and<00:02:41.440> search

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
risking their lives to go in and search

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.370 
risking their lives to go in and search
for<00:02:41.740> and<00:02:42.310> get<00:02:42.940> all<00:02:43.180> civilian<00:02:43.750> victims<00:02:43.930> out<00:02:44.320> of

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
the out of the structure which they did

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.750 
the out of the structure which they did
they<00:02:46.810> did<00:02:46.989> a<00:02:47.020> search<00:02:47.650> at<00:02:47.830> that<00:02:48.010> time<00:02:48.280> as<00:02:48.520> well

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
they did a search at that time as well

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.220 
they did a search at that time as well
and<00:02:49.030> they<00:02:49.090> were<00:02:49.209> confident<00:02:49.690> that<00:02:49.810> they<00:02:50.020> had

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
and they were confident that they had

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.070 
and they were confident that they had
gotten<00:02:50.440> everybody<00:02:50.770> out<00:02:51.120> so<00:02:52.120> then<00:02:52.360> they<00:02:52.570> pulled

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
gotten everybody out so then they pulled

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.930 
gotten everybody out so then they pulled
back<00:02:53.320> and<00:02:53.560> they<00:02:53.680> pulled<00:02:53.980> out<00:02:54.160> they<00:02:54.459> recognized

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
back and they pulled out they recognized

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.430 
back and they pulled out they recognized
it<00:02:55.120> was<00:02:55.239> an<00:02:55.360> abandoned<00:02:55.840> building<00:02:56.020> with<00:02:56.410> the

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
it was an abandoned building with the

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.410 
it was an abandoned building with the

inherent dangers of a structure like

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.510 
inherent dangers of a structure like

that went into a defensive mode a
defensive<00:03:01.239> mode<00:03:01.420> essentially<00:03:02.050> means<00:03:02.320> we're

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
defensive mode essentially means we're

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.290 
defensive mode essentially means we're
