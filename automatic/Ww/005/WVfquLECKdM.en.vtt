think<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.310> might<00:01:44.549> have<00:01:44.610> been<00:01:44.729> jelavic<00:01:45.149> but<00:01:45.689> he

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
think it might have been jelavic but he

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.600

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.099 
then that is going to be more realistic

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:59.069

episode<00:04:38.260> was<00:04:38.350> going<00:04:38.560> to<00:04:38.650> be<00:04:38.740> a<00:04:38.770> villa<00:04:39.130> park<00:04:39.370> up

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
episode was going to be a villa park up

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.830 
episode was going to be a villa park up
against<00:04:39.880> Arsenal<00:04:40.390> and<00:04:40.450> that<00:04:40.600> is<00:04:40.720> the<00:04:40.810> reason

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
against Arsenal and that is the reason

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.890 
against Arsenal and that is the reason
why<00:04:41.170> we<00:04:41.920> rested<00:04:42.340> a<00:04:42.490> lot<00:04:42.640> of<00:04:42.850> players<00:04:43.060> for<00:04:43.750> the

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
why we rested a lot of players for the

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.530 
why we rested a lot of players for the
game<00:04:44.110> up<00:04:44.380> against<00:04:44.860> um<00:04:45.040> because<00:04:45.940> we<00:04:46.090> rest<00:04:46.360> a<00:04:46.450> lot

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
game up against um because we rest a lot

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.000 
game up against um because we rest a lot
of<00:04:46.660> players<00:04:46.810> against<00:04:47.110> hole<00:04:47.350> and<00:04:47.650> that<00:04:47.860> is

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
of players against hole and that is

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.110 
of players against hole and that is
reason<00:04:48.340> because<00:04:48.520> we<00:04:48.580> had<00:04:48.700> a<00:04:48.730> really<00:04:48.910> difficult

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
reason because we had a really difficult

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.700 
reason because we had a really difficult
game<00:04:49.390> at<00:04:49.540> villa<00:04:49.690> park<00:04:49.750> up<00:04:50.110> against<00:04:50.290> Arsenal

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
game at villa park up against Arsenal

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.160 
game at villa park up against Arsenal
only<00:04:50.920> three<00:04:51.370> days<00:04:51.760> later<00:04:52.150> so<00:04:52.840> it's<00:04:52.930> gonna<00:04:53.050> be

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.170 
only three days later so it's gonna be

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.140 
only three days later so it's gonna be
real<00:04:53.380> test<00:04:53.680> for<00:04:53.890> us<00:04:54.160> here<00:04:54.400> obviously<00:04:55.000> we're

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
real test for us here obviously we're

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.370 
real test for us here obviously we're
strong<00:04:55.360> world<00:04:55.570> class<00:04:55.840> so<00:04:55.990> you<00:04:56.020> never<00:04:56.200> know

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
strong world class so you never know

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.530 
strong world class so you never know
what's<00:04:56.620> going<00:04:56.740> to<00:04:56.800> happen<00:04:56.860> button<00:04:57.520> because<00:04:58.420> in

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
what's going to happen button because in

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.210 
what's going to happen button because in
real<00:04:58.720> life<00:04:58.900> Arsenal<00:04:59.530> would<00:04:59.650> probably<00:04:59.980> beat

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
real life Arsenal would probably beat

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.760 
real life Arsenal would probably beat
Aston<00:05:00.700> Villa<00:05:00.880> and<00:05:01.090> therefore<00:05:02.080> if<00:05:02.380> we<00:05:02.590> put<00:05:02.740> a

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
Aston Villa and therefore if we put a

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.530 
Aston Villa and therefore if we put a
legendary<00:05:03.280> be<00:05:03.520> more<00:05:03.730> realistic<00:05:04.000> on<00:05:04.300> the<00:05:04.360> first

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
legendary be more realistic on the first

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:05.760 
legendary be more realistic on the first
chance<00:05:04.750> again<00:05:04.960> asking<00:05:05.200> for<00:05:05.350> to<00:05:05.470> ask<00:05:05.590> Abby
