science<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.850> not<00:01:20.909> this<00:01:21.450> thing<00:01:21.690> that<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.110> just

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
science is not this thing that you just

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
students need to learn that that

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.370 
students need to learn that that
experience<00:01:32.010> of<00:01:32.520> failing<00:01:33.090> without<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.049> costing

things that nobody else has done and
that's<00:01:43.080> what<00:01:43.439> really<00:01:43.500> helps<00:01:44.070> them<00:01:44.220> decide<00:01:44.369> is

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
that's what really helps them decide is

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.370 
that's what really helps them decide is

program<00:02:00.130> and<00:02:00.460> I<00:02:00.520> mean<00:02:00.670> that<00:02:00.700> in<00:02:00.850> every<00:02:01.180> sense

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
program and I mean that in every sense

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.150 
program and I mean that in every sense
of<00:02:01.690> the<00:02:01.750> word<00:02:01.840> because<00:02:02.290> we<00:02:02.590> have<00:02:02.680> streams<00:02:02.950> and

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
of the word because we have streams and

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.430 
of the word because we have streams and
autonomous<00:02:03.850> vehicles<00:02:04.240> robot<00:02:04.600> cars<00:02:04.870> we<00:02:05.350> have

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
autonomous vehicles robot cars we have

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.650 
autonomous vehicles robot cars we have
streams<00:02:05.740> in<00:02:06.070> gaming<00:02:06.490> we<00:02:06.790> have<00:02:06.910> streams<00:02:07.300> in

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
streams in gaming we have streams in

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.380 
streams in gaming we have streams in
genomic<00:02:08.200> engineering<00:02:08.470> it<00:02:08.950> is<00:02:09.190> incredible<00:02:10.090> all

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
genomic engineering it is incredible all

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.360 
genomic engineering it is incredible all
the<00:02:10.720> things<00:02:10.960> we<00:02:11.140> do<00:02:11.320> not<00:02:11.950> always<00:02:12.130> been

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
the things we do not always been

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.860 
the things we do not always been
interested<00:02:12.760> in<00:02:12.820> physics<00:02:13.030> and<00:02:13.300> astronomy<00:02:13.450> in

interested in physics and astronomy in
particular<00:02:14.350> and<00:02:14.590> so<00:02:15.160> when<00:02:15.700> I<00:02:15.730> heard<00:02:15.910> about

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
particular and so when I heard about

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.430 
particular and so when I heard about
exploring<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.660> universe<00:02:16.959> of<00:02:17.080> white<00:02:17.230> dwarf

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
exploring the universe of white dwarf

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.050 
exploring the universe of white dwarf
stars<00:02:17.709> that's<00:02:18.010> what<00:02:18.190> grabbed<00:02:18.520> to<00:02:18.670> me<00:02:18.790> I<00:02:18.820> guess

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
stars that's what grabbed to me I guess

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.360 
stars that's what grabbed to me I guess
when<00:02:19.630> I<00:02:19.690> first<00:02:19.870> got<00:02:20.170> to<00:02:20.380> college<00:02:20.590> I<00:02:20.830> thought<00:02:21.040> I

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
when I first got to college I thought I

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.430 
when I first got to college I thought I
think<00:02:22.030> like<00:02:22.150> almost<00:02:22.480> every<00:02:22.780> other<00:02:22.810> bio<00:02:23.140> major

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
think like almost every other bio major

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.440 
think like almost every other bio major

the research part of science it's

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.050 
the research part of science it's
awesome<00:02:35.080> to<00:02:35.110> be<00:02:35.320> 18<00:02:36.010> and<00:02:36.040> just<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:36.520> freshman<00:02:36.760> at

things<00:02:43.750> I<00:02:44.080> went<00:02:44.770> to<00:02:44.860> do<00:02:45.100> a<00:02:45.360> medical<00:02:46.360> mission

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
things I went to do a medical mission

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.570 
things I went to do a medical mission
trip<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:47.200> that<00:02:47.770> kind<00:02:48.040> of<00:02:48.130> struck<00:02:48.370> my<00:02:48.550> heart

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
trip and that kind of struck my heart

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.310 
trip and that kind of struck my heart
and<00:02:48.880> I<00:02:48.940> really<00:02:49.209> wanted<00:02:49.480> to<00:02:49.540> do<00:02:49.810> something

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
and I really wanted to do something

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.010 
and I really wanted to do something
related<00:02:50.950> to<00:02:50.980> infectious<00:02:51.550> diseases<00:02:52.020> you'd

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
related to infectious diseases you'd

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.210 
related to infectious diseases you'd
asked<00:02:53.200> me<00:02:53.320> my<00:02:53.560> senior<00:02:53.860> year<00:02:53.890> of<00:02:54.040> high<00:02:54.190> school

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
asked me my senior year of high school

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.090 
asked me my senior year of high school
that<00:02:54.730> in<00:02:54.910> two<00:02:55.060> years<00:02:55.269> I'd<00:02:55.540> be<00:02:55.660> doing<00:02:55.989> top<00:02:56.950> of

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
that in two years I'd be doing top of

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.560 
that in two years I'd be doing top of
the<00:02:57.160> line<00:02:57.340> cutting<00:02:57.640> edge<00:02:57.850> research<00:02:57.880> in

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
the line cutting edge research in

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.900 
the line cutting edge research in
astrophysics<00:02:58.780> I<00:02:59.620> I<00:03:00.220> would<00:03:00.549> have<00:03:00.640> called<00:03:00.700> you<00:03:00.820> a

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
astrophysics I I would have called you a

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:11.850 
astrophysics I I would have called you a
liar<00:03:09.150> I've<00:03:10.150> been<00:03:10.330> at<00:03:10.450> UT<00:03:10.810> anyway<00:03:11.140> for<00:03:11.380> 30<00:03:11.590> years

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
liar I've been at UT anyway for 30 years

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.020 
liar I've been at UT anyway for 30 years
and<00:03:12.250> you<00:03:13.120> might<00:03:13.330> ask<00:03:13.540> does<00:03:14.080> it<00:03:14.230> get<00:03:14.350> stale<00:03:14.650> and

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
and you might ask does it get stale and

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.640 
and you might ask does it get stale and
the<00:03:16.030> answer<00:03:16.390> is<00:03:16.420> no<00:03:16.930> and<00:03:17.170> the<00:03:17.230> reason<00:03:17.290> it

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
the answer is no and the reason it

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.289 
the answer is no and the reason it
doesn't<00:03:17.830> get<00:03:18.040> stale<00:03:18.310> is<00:03:18.519> because<00:03:18.850> of<00:03:18.880> the<00:03:19.060> kids

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
doesn't get stale is because of the kids

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.390 
doesn't get stale is because of the kids
I<00:03:19.600> really<00:03:20.350> believe<00:03:20.560> that<00:03:20.590> all<00:03:20.769> education<00:03:21.220> is

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
I really believe that all education is

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.100 
I really believe that all education is
self-education<00:03:21.640> and<00:03:22.299> so<00:03:22.360> all<00:03:22.540> I<00:03:22.570> really<00:03:22.930> want

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
self-education and so all I really want

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.930 
self-education and so all I really want
her<00:03:23.260> students<00:03:23.650> that<00:03:23.769> are<00:03:23.860> excited<00:03:24.280> enough<00:03:24.489> to

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
her students that are excited enough to

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.310 
her students that are excited enough to
go<00:03:25.090> and<00:03:25.299> learn<00:03:25.420> for<00:03:25.660> themselves<00:03:25.690> and<00:03:26.080> I<00:03:26.140> can

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
go and learn for themselves and I can

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.930 
go and learn for themselves and I can
guide<00:03:26.560> them<00:03:26.769> and<00:03:26.950> direct<00:03:27.010> them<00:03:27.250> and<00:03:27.489> I<00:03:27.519> can<00:03:27.580> you

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
guide them and direct them and I can you

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.030 
guide them and direct them and I can you
know<00:03:28.030> save<00:03:28.239> them<00:03:28.420> some<00:03:28.600> time<00:03:28.810> but<00:03:29.380> mostly<00:03:29.739> I'm

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
know save them some time but mostly I'm

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.340 
know save them some time but mostly I'm
looking<00:03:30.700> for<00:03:30.880> them<00:03:31.000> to<00:03:31.510> come<00:03:31.720> in<00:03:31.780> and<00:03:32.110> be

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
looking for them to come in and be

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.259 
looking for them to come in and be
excited<00:03:32.709> and<00:03:33.100> if<00:03:33.310> they<00:03:33.430> do<00:03:33.489> that<00:03:33.730> the<00:03:33.970> rest<00:03:34.000> is

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
excited and if they do that the rest is

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.050 
excited and if they do that the rest is
easy<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:35.500> amount<00:03:35.980> of<00:03:36.160> different<00:03:36.610> work<00:03:36.790> that's

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
easy the amount of different work that's

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.780 
easy the amount of different work that's
done<00:03:37.209> and<00:03:37.269> UT<00:03:37.690> is<00:03:37.870> tremendous<00:03:38.680> so<00:03:39.160> if<00:03:39.310> i<00:03:39.459> wanted

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
done and UT is tremendous so if i wanted

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.479 
done and UT is tremendous so if i wanted
to<00:03:39.850> do<00:03:40.090> literally<00:03:40.900> anything<00:03:41.049> i<00:03:41.830> could<00:03:42.040> do<00:03:42.310> it

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489
