certainly am a cheerleader for juice if
i<00:00:23.160> had<00:00:23.340> pom-poms<00:00:23.970> i<00:00:24.420> would<00:00:24.630> break<00:00:24.810> him<00:00:24.990> out<00:00:25.109> but

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
i had pom-poms i would break him out but

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.890 
i had pom-poms i would break him out but
you<00:00:25.949> know<00:00:26.519> i<00:00:26.640> didn't<00:00:27.000> make<00:00:27.150> cheerleading<00:00:27.449> in

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
you know i didn't make cheerleading in

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.919 
you know i didn't make cheerleading in
high<00:00:28.080> school<00:00:28.439> so<00:00:28.769> he<00:00:29.220> needs<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.609> palm<00:00:29.820> home<00:00:30.060> so

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
high school so he needs the palm home so

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.010 
high school so he needs the palm home so
here's<00:00:31.529> why<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:32.369> prefer<00:00:32.790> juice<00:00:33.420> over<00:00:33.989> a

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
here's why I prefer juice over a

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.040 
here's why I prefer juice over a
smoothie<00:00:34.590> when<00:00:35.430> you<00:00:35.550> make<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.760> smoothie<00:00:36.480> all

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
smoothie when you make a smoothie all

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.610 
smoothie when you make a smoothie all
the<00:00:37.260> fibers<00:00:37.710> left<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.820> smoothie<00:00:39.239> so

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
the fibers left in the smoothie so

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.560 
the fibers left in the smoothie so
basically<00:00:40.620> what<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:40.800> means<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.610> your<00:00:42.239> body

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
basically what that means is your body

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.709 
basically what that means is your body
has<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.200> work<00:00:43.469> twice<00:00:44.100> as<00:00:44.250> hard<00:00:44.520> three<00:00:45.149> times<00:00:45.180> is

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
has to work twice as hard three times is

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.560 
has to work twice as hard three times is
hard<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.200> break<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:46.620> down<00:00:46.950> in<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:48.030> stomach

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
hard to break that down in the stomach

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.130 
hard to break that down in the stomach
and<00:00:48.920> when<00:00:49.920> your<00:00:50.039> body<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.430> breaking<00:00:50.730> down

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
and when your body is breaking down

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.979 
and when your body is breaking down
fiber<00:00:52.140> fibers<00:00:53.039> matter<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.789> takes<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.690> lot<00:00:54.960> of

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
fiber fibers matter it takes a lot of

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.610 
fiber fibers matter it takes a lot of
your<00:00:55.289> energy<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:56.190> digest<00:00:56.960> but<00:00:57.960> with<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.230> juice

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
your energy to digest but with the juice

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.000 
your energy to digest but with the juice
it's<00:00:59.309> already<00:00:59.969> broken<00:01:00.390> down<00:01:00.719> for<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.350> the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
it's already broken down for you the

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.549 
it's already broken down for you the
