and two other plants basically raspberry

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.189 
and two other plants basically raspberry
and<00:00:56.370> tomato<00:00:56.640> together<00:00:57.000> I've<00:00:57.719> been<00:00:57.840> told<00:00:58.020> that

and tomato together I've been told that

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.959 
and tomato together I've been told that
raspberry<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.859> tomato<00:00:59.129> together<00:00:59.489> don't<00:00:59.760> grow

you can see that's about it I think my
secret<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:13.350> all<00:02:13.650> of<00:02:13.800> this<00:02:13.950> gardening<00:02:14.520> is

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
secret to all of this gardening is

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:21.160 
secret to all of this gardening is
actually<00:02:17.630> what<00:02:18.630> I<00:02:18.660> called<00:02:18.900> chicken<00:02:20.150> so

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
actually what I called chicken so

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:31.960 
actually what I called chicken so
it<00:02:22.170> is<00:02:22.440> a<00:02:23.510> basically<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:26.450> 4<00:02:27.450> 6<00:02:27.840> 8<00:02:29.390> 10<00:02:30.390> min<00:02:30.600> yer<00:02:30.780> a

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
it is a basically a 4 6 8 10 min yer a

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.330 
it is a basically a 4 6 8 10 min yer a
fertilizer<00:02:32.970> I<00:02:33.120> sprinkled<00:02:33.720> that<00:02:34.100> directly<00:02:35.100> on

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
fertilizer I sprinkled that directly on

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.580 
fertilizer I sprinkled that directly on
underneath<00:02:35.730> as<00:02:36.330> you<00:02:36.480> can<00:02:36.630> see<00:02:36.870> back<00:02:37.110> in<00:02:37.140> there

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
underneath as you can see back in there

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.080 
underneath as you can see back in there
and<00:02:37.800> then<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:38.010> can<00:02:38.160> see<00:02:38.400> some<00:02:38.640> of<00:02:38.670> that<00:02:38.850> just

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
and then you can see some of that just

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.590 
and then you can see some of that just
right<00:02:39.270> there<00:02:39.450> and<00:02:39.750> every<00:02:40.080> time<00:02:40.110> I<00:02:40.260> water<00:02:40.590> it

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
right there and every time I water it

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.270 
right there and every time I water it
some<00:02:42.600> of<00:02:42.690> that<00:02:42.780> goes<00:02:42.989> down<00:02:43.200> into<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.560> soil<00:02:43.770> so

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
some of that goes down into the soil so

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.790 
some of that goes down into the soil so
I<00:02:44.310> think<00:02:44.540> that's<00:02:45.540> pretty<00:02:45.750> well<00:02:45.989> my<00:02:46.200> trick<00:02:46.530> if<00:02:46.739> I

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
I think that's pretty well my trick if I

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.190 
I think that's pretty well my trick if I
can<00:02:46.980> really<00:02:47.130> get<00:02:47.489> back<00:02:47.760> from<00:02:48.150> this<00:02:48.330> and<00:02:48.390> put<00:02:49.170> a

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
can really get back from this and put a

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.050 
can really get back from this and put a
chair<00:02:49.530> next<00:02:49.770> to<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.130> so<00:02:50.250> you<00:02:50.310> can<00:02:50.489> really<00:02:50.760> see

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
chair next to it so you can really see

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.699 
chair next to it so you can really see
the<00:02:51.180> size<00:02:53.630> if<00:02:54.630> I<00:02:54.720> go<00:02:54.870> any<00:02:55.020> further<00:02:55.050> I'll<00:02:55.500> fall

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
the size if I go any further I'll fall

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.210 
the size if I go any further I'll fall
off<00:02:55.890> my<00:02:56.070> balcony<00:02:56.340> but<00:02:56.850> basically<00:02:57.980> and<00:02:58.980> there's

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
off my balcony but basically and there's

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.100 
off my balcony but basically and there's
your<00:02:59.430> average<00:03:00.239> size<00:03:00.480> chair<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:01.310> there<00:03:02.310> is<00:03:02.520> one
