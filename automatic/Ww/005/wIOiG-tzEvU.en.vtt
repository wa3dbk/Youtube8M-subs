classic movie I mean there's so many
degrees<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.850> separation<00:00:42.570> between<00:00:42.809> this<00:00:43.800> game

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
degrees of separation between this game

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.209 
degrees of separation between this game
and<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.760> classic<00:00:45.450> predator<00:00:46.020> movie<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.920> it's

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
and the classic predator movie that it's

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.760 
and the classic predator movie that it's
almost<00:00:47.700> unfathomable<00:00:48.329> for<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.350> be<00:00:49.530> good

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
almost unfathomable for it to be good

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.760 
almost unfathomable for it to be good
but<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.430> in<00:00:50.700> almost<00:00:51.090> every<00:00:51.420> aspect<00:00:51.770> except

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
but it is in almost every aspect except

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.220 
but it is in almost every aspect except
one<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.399> really<00:00:53.789> hurts<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.600> that's<00:00:55.050> the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
one that really hurts it and that's the

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.350 
one that really hurts it and that's the
difficulty<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.280> difficulty<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.120> game

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
not really as hard as some of the other

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.680 
not really as hard as some of the other
things<00:02:29.040> in<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.340> game<00:02:29.549> like<00:02:29.760> for<00:02:30.000> example<00:02:30.120> well

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
things in the game like for example well

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.180 
things in the game like for example well
sometimes<00:02:31.049> you<00:02:31.170> have<00:02:31.200> these<00:02:31.409> special<00:02:32.010> enemies

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
sometimes you have these special enemies

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.699 
sometimes you have these special enemies
like<00:02:32.760> helicopters<00:02:33.269> that<00:02:33.659> shoot<00:02:34.049> at<00:02:34.200> your<00:02:34.319> guys

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
like helicopters that shoot at your guys

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.589

hiding behind the car shooting at you

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.660 
hiding behind the car shooting at you
and<00:02:36.750> those<00:02:37.230> are<00:02:37.409> really<00:02:37.950> tough<00:02:38.159> to<00:02:38.310> take<00:02:38.489> out

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
and those are really tough to take out

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.770 
and those are really tough to take out
because<00:02:38.879> you<00:02:38.970> have<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.150> shoot<00:02:39.420> them<00:02:39.510> a<00:02:39.629> bunch

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
because you have to shoot them a bunch

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.470 
because you have to shoot them a bunch
of<00:02:39.930> times<00:02:40.170> while<00:02:40.799> add-ons<00:02:41.549> are<00:02:41.819> coming<00:02:42.209> at<00:02:42.329> you

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
of times while add-ons are coming at you

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.270 
of times while add-ons are coming at you
from<00:02:42.659> all<00:02:42.870> sides<00:02:43.230> like<00:02:43.680> it's<00:02:43.859> some<00:02:44.010> kind<00:02:44.189> of

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
from all sides like it's some kind of

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.460 
from all sides like it's some kind of
zombie<00:02:44.819> apocalypse<00:02:45.569> but<00:02:45.810> instead<00:02:46.049> of<00:02:46.109> zombies

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
zombie apocalypse but instead of zombies

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.069 
zombie apocalypse but instead of zombies
it's<00:02:46.890> like<00:02:47.069> tweakers<00:02:47.700> on<00:02:47.940> meth<00:02:48.180> but<00:02:48.599> I<00:02:48.780> guess

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
it's like tweakers on meth but I guess

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:50.809 
it's like tweakers on meth but I guess
it's<00:02:49.290> like<00:02:49.349> almost<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.159> same<00:02:50.370> thing<00:02:50.609> and

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
it's like almost the same thing and

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.490 
it's like almost the same thing and
while<00:02:51.299> you're<00:02:51.480> trying<00:02:51.629> to<00:02:51.750> shoot<00:02:51.959> this<00:02:52.139> enemy

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
while you're trying to shoot this enemy

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.530 
while you're trying to shoot this enemy
that<00:02:52.590> takes<00:02:52.829> a<00:02:53.040> lot<00:02:53.190> of<00:02:53.250> shots<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:54.000> avoiding

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
that takes a lot of shots and avoiding

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.599 
that takes a lot of shots and avoiding
the<00:02:54.629> crazy<00:02:54.900> drug<00:02:55.290> dealers<00:02:55.680> you<00:02:55.829> also<00:02:56.310> have<00:02:56.489> to

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
the crazy drug dealers you also have to

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.210 
the crazy drug dealers you also have to
avoid<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:57.150> projectiles<00:02:57.930> of<00:02:58.200> these<00:02:58.769> really

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
avoid the projectiles of these really

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.129 
avoid the projectiles of these really
tough<00:02:59.459> enemies<00:03:00.060> so<00:03:00.569> you're<00:03:00.720> basically

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:01.139 
tough enemies so you're basically

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:02.690 
tough enemies so you're basically
running<00:03:01.409> like<00:03:01.709> back<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.250> forth<00:03:02.489> you

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
running like back and forth you

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.250 
running like back and forth you

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
like five or six guys run forward to the

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.729 
like five or six guys run forward to the
enemy<00:03:08.790> again<00:03:09.000> avoid<00:03:09.599> its<00:03:09.840> shots<00:03:10.170> shoot<00:03:10.590> it

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
enemy again avoid its shots shoot it

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.369 
enemy again avoid its shots shoot it
it's<00:03:11.159> just<00:03:11.430> really<00:03:11.879> really<00:03:12.329> toughest<00:03:13.109> and<00:03:13.260> the

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
it's just really really toughest and the

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.289 
it's just really really toughest and the
toughness<00:03:13.620> in<00:03:13.920> this<00:03:14.040> game<00:03:14.250> is<00:03:14.400> inconsistent

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
toughness in this game is inconsistent

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.839 
toughness in this game is inconsistent
like<00:03:15.480> I<00:03:15.690> had<00:03:16.109> an<00:03:16.230> easier<00:03:16.620> time<00:03:16.920> beating<00:03:17.579> the

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
like I had an easier time beating the

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.460 
like I had an easier time beating the
fourth<00:03:18.180> level<00:03:18.449> than<00:03:18.810> they<00:03:18.930> did<00:03:18.989> like<00:03:19.319> the

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
fourth level than they did like the

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.170 
fourth level than they did like the
second<00:03:19.919> level<00:03:20.190> you<00:03:20.310> know<00:03:20.430> it's<00:03:20.579> it's<00:03:20.940> a<00:03:21.060> little

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
second level you know it's it's a little

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.420 
second level you know it's it's a little
strange<00:03:21.720> you<00:03:21.900> would<00:03:22.169> assume<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:23.010> game<00:03:23.220> gets

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
strange you would assume the game gets

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.699 
strange you would assume the game gets
progressively<00:03:23.699> harder<00:03:24.599> I<00:03:24.989> really<00:03:25.379> don't<00:03:25.560> like

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
progressively harder I really don't like

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.580 
progressively harder I really don't like
it<00:03:25.919> when<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.160> game<00:03:26.310> is<00:03:26.519> hard<00:03:26.879> but<00:03:27.180> also

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
it when the game is hard but also

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.080 
it when the game is hard but also
inconsistent<00:03:28.590> in<00:03:28.769> its<00:03:28.980> toughness<00:03:29.310> sometimes

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
inconsistent in its toughness sometimes

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.180 
inconsistent in its toughness sometimes
you<00:03:30.239> actually<00:03:30.389> have<00:03:30.599> to<00:03:30.810> fight<00:03:31.049> the<00:03:31.650> predator

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
you actually have to fight the predator

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.250 
you actually have to fight the predator
and<00:03:32.370> those<00:03:32.519> are<00:03:32.730> really<00:03:32.970> tough<00:03:33.329> but<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:34.049> good

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
and those are really tough but the good

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.289 
and those are really tough but the good
thing<00:03:34.290> about<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.769> predator<00:03:35.220> is<00:03:35.370> you<00:03:35.819> kind<00:03:36.209> of

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
thing about the predator is you kind of

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.479 
thing about the predator is you kind of
understand<00:03:36.840> their<00:03:37.049> pattern<00:03:37.530> so<00:03:37.829> as<00:03:38.129> long<00:03:38.280> as

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
understand their pattern so as long as

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.520 
understand their pattern so as long as
you<00:03:38.609> get<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:38.910> Predators<00:03:39.419> pattern<00:03:39.870> down<00:03:40.109> you

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
you get the Predators pattern down you

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.229 
you get the Predators pattern down you
can<00:03:40.680> kind<00:03:40.859> of<00:03:40.949> just<00:03:41.099> run<00:03:41.459> out<00:03:41.699> of<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:41.940> way<00:03:41.970> of

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
can kind of just run out of the way of

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.479 
can kind of just run out of the way of
the<00:03:42.389> Predators<00:03:42.840> attacks<00:03:43.260> wait<00:03:43.680> a<00:03:43.709> few<00:03:43.980> seconds

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
the Predators attacks wait a few seconds

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.610 
the Predators attacks wait a few seconds
and<00:03:44.579> jump<00:03:45.329> in<00:03:45.540> with<00:03:45.569> your<00:03:45.989> shots<00:03:46.290> and<00:03:46.590> just

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
and jump in with your shots and just

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.039 
and jump in with your shots and just
rinse<00:03:47.040> and<00:03:47.160> repeat<00:03:47.579> over<00:03:47.819> and<00:03:47.970> over<00:03:48.180> until<00:03:48.540> the

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
rinse and repeat over and over until the

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.509 
rinse and repeat over and over until the
predator<00:03:49.500> kind<00:03:49.769> of<00:03:49.889> escapes

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
predator kind of escapes

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.099 
predator kind of escapes
yeah<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:50.910> Predators<00:03:51.239> aren't<00:03:51.449> really<00:03:51.629> agile

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
yeah the Predators aren't really agile

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.599 
yeah the Predators aren't really agile
in<00:03:52.199> these<00:03:52.319> instances<00:03:52.799> they<00:03:53.129> just<00:03:53.340> kind<00:03:53.519> of

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
in these instances they just kind of

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.360 
in these instances they just kind of
standards<00:03:54.209> very<00:03:54.870> much<00:03:55.169> unlike<00:03:55.680> a<00:03:55.739> predator

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
standards very much unlike a predator

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.680 
standards very much unlike a predator
but<00:03:56.760> I<00:03:56.790> mean<00:03:56.970> if<00:03:57.120> they're<00:03:57.269> just<00:03:57.480> running

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
but I mean if they're just running

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.479 
but I mean if they're just running
around<00:03:57.930> hopping<00:03:58.590> all<00:03:58.709> over<00:03:58.739> the<00:03:59.040> screen<00:03:59.370> the

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
around hopping all over the screen the

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.250 
around hopping all over the screen the
game<00:03:59.639> would<00:03:59.909> just<00:04:00.120> go<00:04:00.419> from<00:04:00.690> hard<00:04:00.959> to

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
game would just go from hard to

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.259 
game would just go from hard to
completely<00:04:01.980> impossible<00:04:02.669> in<00:04:02.760> these<00:04:02.879> instances

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
completely impossible in these instances

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.809 
completely impossible in these instances
yeah<00:04:04.049> really<00:04:04.349> the<00:04:04.500> difficulty<00:04:05.310> is<00:04:05.400> the<00:04:05.549> one

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
yeah really the difficulty is the one

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.030 
yeah really the difficulty is the one
thing<00:04:06.090> that<00:04:06.329> really<00:04:06.510> pulls<00:04:07.079> this<00:04:07.379> Genesis

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
thing that really pulls this Genesis

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.399 
thing that really pulls this Genesis
game<00:04:08.310> back<00:04:08.609> from<00:04:08.639> being<00:04:09.329> a<00:04:09.690> great<00:04:10.109> and

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:10.409 
game back from being a great and

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:13.309 
game back from being a great and
memorable<00:04:11.129> classic<00:04:11.790> everything<00:04:12.690> else<00:04:12.870> in<00:04:13.139> it

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
memorable classic everything else in it

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.979 
memorable classic everything else in it
is<00:04:13.470> fantastic<00:04:14.400> it's<00:04:14.879> just<00:04:15.120> like<00:04:15.269> I<00:04:15.419> wish<00:04:15.750> there

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
is fantastic it's just like I wish there

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.399 
is fantastic it's just like I wish there
was<00:04:16.139> less<00:04:16.859> projectiles<00:04:17.789> flying<00:04:18.419> at<00:04:18.690> you<00:04:18.810> from

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:19.409 
was less projectiles flying at you from

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:22.490 
was less projectiles flying at you from
all<00:04:19.769> angles<00:04:20.250> like<00:04:20.940> the<00:04:21.479> world<00:04:21.840> just<00:04:22.320> exploded

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
all angles like the world just exploded

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.370 
all angles like the world just exploded
and<00:04:23.400> shrapnel<00:04:23.909> is<00:04:24.360> just<00:04:24.900> coming<00:04:25.500> at<00:04:25.650> you<00:04:25.830> from

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
and shrapnel is just coming at you from

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.590 
and shrapnel is just coming at you from
everywhere<00:04:27.010> and<00:04:27.310> anywhere<00:04:27.730> if<00:04:28.210> there<00:04:28.480> was

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
everywhere and anywhere if there was

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.290 
everywhere and anywhere if there was
just<00:04:28.810> maybe<00:04:28.990> I<00:04:29.170> don't<00:04:29.290> know<00:04:29.470> 30<00:04:30.100> 40<00:04:30.730> percent

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
just maybe I don't know 30 40 percent

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.840 
just maybe I don't know 30 40 percent
less<00:04:31.750> projectiles<00:04:32.620> constantly<00:04:33.370> coming<00:04:33.700> at

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
less projectiles constantly coming at

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.000 
less projectiles constantly coming at
you<00:04:34.030> the<00:04:34.630> game<00:04:34.840> would<00:04:35.020> be<00:04:35.050> fantastic<00:04:35.380> because

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
you the game would be fantastic because

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.920 
you the game would be fantastic because
it<00:04:36.340> does<00:04:36.550> look<00:04:36.820> good<00:04:37.030> it<00:04:37.240> handles<00:04:37.690> great

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
it does look good it handles great

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.020 
it does look good it handles great
there's<00:04:38.350> a<00:04:38.410> good<00:04:38.680> variety<00:04:38.860> of<00:04:39.130> weapons<00:04:39.430> the

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
there's a good variety of weapons the

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.420 
there's a good variety of weapons the
objectives<00:04:40.600> are<00:04:40.750> clear<00:04:41.200> and<00:04:41.500> it's<00:04:41.740> fun<00:04:42.160> to

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
objectives are clear and it's fun to

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.640 
objectives are clear and it's fun to
play<00:04:42.700> I<00:04:43.030> just<00:04:43.330> wish<00:04:43.510> that<00:04:43.720> fun<00:04:44.110> wouldn't<00:04:44.470> be

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
play I just wish that fun wouldn't be

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.440 
play I just wish that fun wouldn't be
interrupted<00:04:45.280> with<00:04:45.520> the<00:04:45.640> crazy<00:04:46.090> hard

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
interrupted with the crazy hard

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.230 
interrupted with the crazy hard
difficulty<00:04:47.080> and<00:04:47.260> your<00:04:47.680> constant<00:04:48.340> deaths<00:04:48.640> even

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
difficulty and your constant deaths even

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.510 
difficulty and your constant deaths even
on<00:04:49.360> easy<00:04:49.600> mode<00:04:49.720> whether<00:04:50.260> or<00:04:50.440> -<00:04:50.650> ultimately<00:04:51.130> is

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
on easy mode whether or - ultimately is

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.730 
on easy mode whether or - ultimately is
a<00:04:52.120> good<00:04:52.510> game<00:04:52.750> but<00:04:53.110> because<00:04:53.260> of<00:04:53.590> its

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
a good game but because of its

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.620 
a good game but because of its
difficulty<00:04:54.160> it's<00:04:54.520> a<00:04:54.640> mixed<00:04:55.000> bag<00:04:55.150> so<00:04:55.420> I<00:04:55.450> don't

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
difficulty it's a mixed bag so I don't

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.420 
difficulty it's a mixed bag so I don't
even<00:04:55.690> think<00:04:55.810> I<00:04:56.080> want<00:04:56.290> to<00:04:56.350> give<00:04:56.560> it<00:04:56.710> their<00:04:57.010> score

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
even think I want to give it their score

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.090 
even think I want to give it their score
of<00:04:57.700> a<00:04:57.880> good<00:04:58.150> game<00:04:58.480> I'll<00:04:58.900> give<00:04:59.200> it<00:04:59.350> a<00:04:59.410> score<00:04:59.740> of<00:04:59.800> a

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
of a good game I'll give it a score of a

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.520 
of a good game I'll give it a score of a
good<00:05:00.370> game<00:05:00.550> with<00:05:00.790> a<00:05:00.850> lot<00:05:01.090> of<00:05:01.120> problems<00:05:01.780> it<00:05:02.170> gets

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
good game with a lot of problems it gets

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.700 
good game with a lot of problems it gets
something<00:05:03.130> like<00:05:03.520> a<00:05:03.600> six<00:05:04.600> point<00:05:04.930> three<00:05:05.050> out<00:05:05.650> of

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
something like a six point three out of

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.100 
something like a six point three out of
