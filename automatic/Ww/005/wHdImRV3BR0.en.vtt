needles<00:00:16.199> so<00:00:17.010> today<00:00:17.369> what<00:00:17.609> we<00:00:17.760> did<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.330> we<00:00:18.600> went

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
needles so today what we did is we went

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.510 
needles so today what we did is we went
out<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.140> we<00:00:19.230> gathered<00:00:19.590> three<00:00:19.920> different

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
out and we gathered three different

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.000 
out and we gathered three different
sizes<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:21.060> pine<00:00:21.300> cones<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.930> some<00:00:22.529> pine<00:00:22.769> cones

sizes of pine cones and some pine cones

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.890 
sizes of pine cones and some pine cones
and<00:00:23.880> I'm<00:00:24.000> going<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.180> run<00:00:24.330> them<00:00:24.449> through<00:00:24.480> one<00:00:24.869> of

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
and I'm going to run them through one of

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.130 
and I'm going to run them through one of
our<00:00:25.019> shredders<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.680> show<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.550> results

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.160 

as<00:00:50.410> you<00:00:51.250> can<00:00:51.370> see<00:00:51.580> that<00:00:51.880> old<00:00:52.150> bag<00:00:52.420> of<00:00:52.450> pinecones

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
as you can see that old bag of pinecones

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.710 
as you can see that old bag of pinecones
is<00:00:53.710> reduced<00:00:54.280> down<00:00:54.610> here<00:00:54.940> to<00:00:55.120> this<00:00:55.210> relatively

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
is reduced down here to this relatively

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.010 
is reduced down here to this relatively
small<00:00:55.930> pile<00:00:56.350> and<00:00:57.130> what<00:00:57.820> you<00:00:58.000> have<00:00:58.300> is<00:00:58.660> really

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
small pile and what you have is really

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.530 
small pile and what you have is really
fine<00:00:59.290> pieces<00:00:59.740> of<00:00:59.980> material<00:01:00.460> that<00:01:00.880> you<00:01:00.940> can<00:01:01.330> use

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
fine pieces of material that you can use

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.350 
fine pieces of material that you can use
for<00:01:01.930> mulch<00:01:02.170> around<00:01:02.650> some<00:01:03.130> of<00:01:03.220> your<00:01:03.340> trees<00:01:03.640> many

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
for mulch around some of your trees many

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.640 
for mulch around some of your trees many
between<00:01:04.809> your<00:01:04.960> raspberry<00:01:05.350> bushes

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.590 

you<00:01:09.220> see<00:01:09.460> what<00:01:09.640> it<00:01:09.730> does<00:01:09.910> with<00:01:10.120> the<00:01:10.150> real<00:01:10.450> small

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
you see what it does with the real small

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.290 
you see what it does with the real small
pine<00:01:11.110> cones<00:01:11.380> now<00:01:12.130> we'll<00:01:12.430> try<00:01:12.610> it<00:01:12.730> with<00:01:13.030> what<00:01:13.210> I

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
pine cones now we'll try it with what I

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:47.370 
pine cones now we'll try it with what I
call<00:01:13.510> some<00:01:13.930> medium-sized<00:01:14.560> light

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.590 

the<00:01:48.189> pinecones<00:01:48.820> were<00:01:48.970> a<00:01:49.000> little<00:01:49.180> larger

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
the pinecones were a little larger

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.260 
the pinecones were a little larger
probably<00:01:50.080> about<00:01:50.290> twice<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:50.650> size<00:01:50.880> but<00:01:51.880> as<00:01:52.000> you

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
probably about twice the size but as you

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.719 
probably about twice the size but as you
can<00:01:52.420> see<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:53.290> results<00:01:53.770> of<00:01:53.830> weekend<00:01:54.189> are

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
can see the results of weekend are

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.260 
can see the results of weekend are
nearly<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:55.390> same<00:01:55.600> a<00:01:55.960> nice<00:01:56.700> finely<00:01:57.700> ground<00:01:58.000> up

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
nearly the same a nice finely ground up

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.060 
nearly the same a nice finely ground up
material<00:02:00.210> hi<00:02:01.210> now<00:02:01.990> let's<00:02:02.350> see<00:02:02.530> what<00:02:02.680> it<00:02:02.770> can<00:02:02.920> do

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
material hi now let's see what it can do

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:30.670 
material hi now let's see what it can do
with<00:02:03.580> some<00:02:03.850> of<00:02:03.940> the<00:02:04.030> larger<00:02:04.450> bundles

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.280 

little<00:02:31.680> larger<00:02:31.980> pinecones<00:02:32.840> but<00:02:33.840> basically

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
little larger pinecones but basically

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.910 
little larger pinecones but basically
the<00:02:34.740> same<00:02:34.980> result<00:02:35.490> beat<00:02:36.450> up<00:02:36.630> into<00:02:36.960> a<00:02:36.990> real<00:02:37.350> fine

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
the same result beat up into a real fine

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.250 
the same result beat up into a real fine
mulching<00:02:38.610> material<00:02:38.730> I<00:02:39.300> think<00:02:39.690> you<00:02:39.900> can<00:02:40.080> use

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
mulching material I think you can use

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.730 
mulching material I think you can use
many<00:02:40.590> ways<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:41.130> use<00:02:41.310> around<00:02:41.670> your<00:02:41.880> property<00:02:42.120> as

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
many ways to use around your property as

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.260 
many ways to use around your property as
you<00:02:43.740> can<00:02:43.890> see<00:02:44.040> it's<00:02:44.190> kind<00:02:44.370> of<00:02:44.400> a<00:02:44.490> dusty<00:02:44.820> process

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
you can see it's kind of a dusty process

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.900 
you can see it's kind of a dusty process
so<00:02:45.810> we<00:02:45.990> recommend<00:02:46.290> gloves<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:47.040> safety
