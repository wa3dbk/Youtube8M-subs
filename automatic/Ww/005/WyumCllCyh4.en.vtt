00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.649
 as if i'm talking about it further what 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.300
 Again, I repeat that I left five 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.860
 days until here I was like 6 kilograms 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.420

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.549
 bought a miller and but generally how did you see 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.210
 last video miller and one miller 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.939
 seemed 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.409
 Generally burnt starting from him decided 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.020
 buy what I usually thump 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.509
 this is yar beer liter mixer ears or slime 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.430
 it is also convenient to hold them in your hand and what 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.829
 many bottles more bottles 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.479
 more the feeling that you drank a lot 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.210
 that is, if one of the forest is only two 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.130
 Bottles here as well as booze worth something 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.259

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:43.409

 the department beginner videobloger here 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:50.729
 it means that when there is a lot of things, itâ€™s not enough 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.439
 Bottles like it seems thats a pancake like 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.149
 this is a purely psychological moment 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.070
 and when a lot of bottles that is already 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.130
 and the feeling that one bottle 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.159
 second third that is but it sort of 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.619

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.600

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.280
 help really 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.490
 15 rubles worth I understand that the price 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:22.390
 overpriced can be worth the top ten 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:26.510
 Here I bought a man with bacon 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:29.180

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.010
 faith 115 rubles such a bottle is there 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.320
 floating some lumps incomprehensible but 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.660
 taste is basically taste nice but he 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.030
