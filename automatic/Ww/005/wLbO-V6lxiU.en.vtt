base<00:00:22.020> it's<00:00:23.010> very<00:00:23.310> common<00:00:23.820> up<00:00:23.910> here<00:00:23.939> i<00:00:24.090> think<00:00:24.240> i

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
base it's very common up here i think i

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.820 
base it's very common up here i think i
braided<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.720> like<00:00:24.869> three<00:00:25.109> times<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.740> the

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
braided it like three times and the

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.470 
braided it like three times and the
first<00:00:26.039> time<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.250> actually<00:00:26.430> hope<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.269> just

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
first time I actually hope I just

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.000 
first time I actually hope I just
dropped<00:00:27.630> my<00:00:27.660> phone<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.349> first<00:00:28.590> time<00:00:28.769> actually

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
dropped my phone the first time actually

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.620 
dropped my phone the first time actually
lost<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.060> did<00:00:30.240> not<00:00:30.359> know<00:00:30.510> how<00:00:30.599> to

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
lost to it and I did not know how to

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.910 
lost to it and I did not know how to
rate<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:30.869> because<00:00:31.109> I'd<00:00:31.199> never<00:00:31.230> seen<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.830> before

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
rate it because I'd never seen it before

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.770 
rate it because I'd never seen it before
and<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.340> tried<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.790> then<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.000> realized<00:00:33.510> how<00:00:33.719> to

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
and I tried it then I realized how to

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.690 
and I tried it then I realized how to
read<00:00:34.050> but<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.410> realized<00:00:34.980> have<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.190> attack<00:00:35.489> the

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
read but I realized have to attack the

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.520 
read but I realized have to attack the
base<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.090> now<00:00:36.870> it's<00:00:37.050> actually<00:00:37.170> pretty<00:00:37.410> easy

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
base and now it's actually pretty easy

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.680 
base and now it's actually pretty easy
for<00:00:37.890> me<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.010> did<00:00:38.219> mess<00:00:38.520> up<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.850> lot<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:39.300> times<00:00:39.510> in

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
for me I did mess up a lot of times in

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.170 
for me I did mess up a lot of times in
this<00:00:39.780> raid<00:00:39.989> but<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:40.710> realized<00:00:41.579> um<00:00:41.790> he<00:00:42.149> had

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
probably only needed two there but it's

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.690 
probably only needed two there but it's
I<00:01:04.080> was<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.799> would<00:01:04.920> have<00:01:05.040> been<00:01:05.100> close<00:01:05.250> with<00:01:05.369> two

how to read it i really didn't want to
 it<00:01:23.790> up<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.060> i<00:01:24.090> think<00:01:24.180> i'd<00:01:24.360> go<00:01:24.479> onto<00:01:24.720> this

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
 it up so i think i'd go onto this

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.330 
 it up so i think i'd go onto this
side<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.229> tried<00:01:25.439> take<00:01:25.680> out<00:01:25.799> these<00:01:25.979> wizard

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
going from the air defense because i

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.620 
going from the air defense because i
realized<00:01:29.369> i<00:01:29.520> would<00:01:29.640> get<00:01:29.820> more<00:01:30.000> percentage<00:01:30.450> by

right on the right side nabi i was

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.449 
right on the right side nabi i was

hoping to go from the one very right

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:57.800 
hoping to go from the one very right
first<00:02:56.700> so<00:02:56.820> we<00:02:56.910> wouldn't<00:02:57.209> go<00:02:57.300> for<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.570> wall

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
first so we wouldn't go for the wall

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.470 
first so we wouldn't go for the wall
later<00:02:58.110> on<00:02:58.350> but<00:02:58.650> he's<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:58.980> dumbass<00:02:59.700> he's<00:03:00.330> going

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
later on but he's a dumbass he's going

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.580 
later on but he's a dumbass he's going
for<00:03:00.630> her<00:03:00.750> wall<00:03:00.930> but<00:03:01.110> it<00:03:01.140> does<00:03:01.350> kind<00:03:01.560> of

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
for her wall but it does kind of

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.750 
for her wall but it does kind of
distract<00:03:01.920> from<00:03:02.010> my<00:03:02.100> queen<00:03:02.400> so<00:03:02.520> I<00:03:02.580> guess<00:03:02.730> it's

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
distract from my queen so I guess it's

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.360 
distract from my queen so I guess it's
not<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.060> worst<00:03:03.330> thing<00:03:03.450> in<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.660> world<00:03:03.690> um<00:03:04.370> and

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
not the worst thing in the world um and

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.160 
not the worst thing in the world um and
as<00:03:05.490> you<00:03:05.580> can<00:03:05.700> see<00:03:05.730> he<00:03:05.940> had<00:03:06.060> CC<00:03:06.390> golem<00:03:06.870> coming

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
as you can see he had CC golem coming

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.080 
as you can see he had CC golem coming
out<00:03:07.290> which<00:03:07.440> is<00:03:07.470> very<00:03:07.800> nice<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.130> see<00:03:08.280> but<00:03:08.730> it<00:03:08.850> can

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
slow down your heroes and it could be

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.800
