00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
to push the little buttons it to get

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.690 
to push the little buttons it to get
them<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.570> slide<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.110> out<00:01:43.259> well<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.340> stiffy

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
them to slide in and out well the stiffy
