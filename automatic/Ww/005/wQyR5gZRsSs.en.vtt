00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:12.720
 came king on d4 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:15.810

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.789
 I'll tell you the anders came coordinates 4 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:21.210
 because Anderson went king here 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:26.220
 so andarza attacks the whole army 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:33.720
 always or two black though put mo 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:37.770

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:42.150
 and here Adolf Anderson was forced 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:46.440
 admit defeat tomato run 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:48.000
