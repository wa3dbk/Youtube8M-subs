00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 big love 1000 ps friends warmly 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.830
 welcome to 1000 ps roger on tour 2014 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.250
 we have 13 motorcycles for you 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.250
 test 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.930
 in addition to all the sports and travel 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.480
 suitable motorcycles we are here 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.420
 The roadshow can just test there 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.910
 even a model that actually only 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.040
 suitable for cruising because for traveling and 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.840
 for sporty driving is a harley 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.430
 davidson at least such a harley 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.739
 davidson did not build that way 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.910
 these are the harley davidson 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.800
 fat bob 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.820
 there must be at the same time as facts above all 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.460
 I look a little bit but I'm not the 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.290
 giant hall here for the crisis next 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.750
 but that's actually more for me 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:05.350
 on the spots of the models you start with 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:08.770
 such a phase is already my favorite 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.180
 he's the fat boy that's ok too 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.530
 even got me the pre-assigned 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.259
 I'm used to footrests totally 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.880
 unfamiliar at the beginning if I wanted 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:17.290
 he always place me back and 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.149
 but then if you are outstretched 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.110
 realize that it is very pleasant in the long run 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:24.610
 is also the seating comfort is high and 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.840
 good the handlebar is from this world 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.170
 happy that you sit something like that 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.970
 stretched otherwise not necessarily mine 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.619
 but I also like that 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.810
 I have to say it honestly 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.420
 hard to resent a hall 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.619
 she does not have the best suspension she has 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.020
 not the best brakes 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:45.640
 there drive the current touring models 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:47.950
 with the rushmore project the hall the 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.600
 the models has been fundamentally revised 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.100
 drive much better because you realize 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.659
 have mistaken a significant difference 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.759
 that 's still a bit of a breeze 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.320
 oldschool hh reader shepherd since this one 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.930
 when braking and of course not 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.640
 But exaggerating a hard one feels 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.490
 Just always and I feel the same 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.560
 very good to me I have to be honest 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.360
 already admit a hall is now 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.190
 a hall that's cool 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.650
 you can not say anything against it but 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.680
 I have to say this too 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.420
 pre-routed footrests and this 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.610
 stretch the handlebar from the sitting position 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.860
 this is not necessarily mainz because 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.019
 the engine just an incredible 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.730
 Provider that is so typical of all that 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.670
 that makes it from below 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.230
 that means I'm right off the stand and 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.909
 there you can almost see the feet of the 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.769
 pedals down so that's for me 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:34.390
 something I do not necessarily 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.129
 but there is another hall there is 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.230
 which in my opinion much better 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.090
 can and do what I want to do again 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.459
 already very tact is this mat 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.049
 Just paint this once again 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.150
 these different than all others 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.190
 how do you like the look we take 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.980
 I also good we think this is so me 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.379
 So safari is maybe desert 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.440
 then i understand more about this world 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:57.549
 colors and grandpa and women flesh for 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.650
 you madness or yes 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:04.299
 well I think but it's okay 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:07.180
 are totally designed from possible so 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.980
 the double headlights and the total 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.180
 I really like very reduced 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.400
 good at such courses 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.340
 so it's not that much of it 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.280
 There is also a hall especially 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.010
 penetrate the engine inside and around 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.640
 is going to be a hell of a lot of metal 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:27.370
 So also built the hall street bob 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.310
 maybe not necessarily our favorite 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.310
 but a real hall just safe 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.560
 keeps its value and just a lot 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.230
 admiration from the audience gets 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.910
 no matter which hall you and especially 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.959
 because of the paint we already fall 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:46.209
 very well wants to buy it 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.239
 yes, who, then, I would know that I have money 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.239
 have
