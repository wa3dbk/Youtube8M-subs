00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.109
 me from turin but not from others 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.300
 I wait for nothing I don't want anything 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.000
 from others I want what we 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.610
 we have and we will not have it 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.010
 earn ourselves and true they have 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.140
 a very important game Thursday but 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.859
 I don't believe it even for a second 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:26.240
 they are not thinking and they are not 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:28.140
 I repeat, also knowing the coach 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.060
 paying attention to the game of 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.560
 so tomorrow a game is waiting for me 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.579
 extremely difficult that if we want 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:39.500
 get something we have to be him 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:42.480
 as far as no-luck was concerned 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.570
 I would talk to those with whom I have 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.399
 spoken I said I spoke I think 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.780
 that from the offensive point of view 21 is 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.270
 was one of the best ailerons that 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.270
 I have what I've had 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.020
 well intended in short , life with the 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.020
 paternal grandmother 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.110
 beginning 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:09.350
 but surely you will see it if you know if 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.320
 from the beginning or during the game 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.159
 I do not know we see is also like him 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.350
 the others 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.030
 comes from a different league arrives 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.970
 from a period of inactivity because it was 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.790
 injured and consequently must 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:26.000
 give him the opportunity to reach a 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.740
 adequate athletic level so now 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.080
 now let's see 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:37.880
 I am very happy with him and 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:40.550
 consequently I have to decide for myself though 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.830
 start it from the beginning no well no me 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.440
 I couldn't believe a team in Rome 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.210
 in difficulty because also the 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.390
 second in the ranking in difficulty that 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:54.560
 plays against the fourth last is pure 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.990
 always a very competitive game 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.960
 as a final summer it will be a match 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.560
 competitive that was decided by the 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.960
 episodes 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.149
 we did not give us a time 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.280
 we gave 20 minutes of the first 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.799
 time because ours are our first 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.110
 twenty minutes and twenty minutes 25 minutes 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:15.410
 the first time they were bad and indeed 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:19.220
 we also had a good opportunity 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.870
 then it is clear that we have some here 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.820
 lowered too much of this is true 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.110
 we gave them the opportunity to 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.079
 dribble even though it was a 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.739
 dribble that is not that it was creating 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:33.019
 these occasions or these imbalances though 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.660
 probably seen as we have 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.910
 interpreted the recovery there we are there 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.310
 it comes naturally to everyone like you too 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:45.250
 tell me but why we didn't 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:48.079
 from the beginning you know I would like it too 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.540
 get one by one 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:52.609
 to have a batch management where 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:57.440
 for 90 minutes I always hold in my hand 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:59.120
 unfortunately, the initiative I know that there 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.030
 we should settle for something 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.760
 less because this does not happen at 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.170
 juventus definitely to Cagliari will 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.060
 very difficult to happen 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.489
 we are working for that is true 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.860
 but for goodness sake we must enter 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:17.180
 in the order of ideas that we can 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:20.830
 manage the game but the opponent will have 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.830
 he too the space to manage it
