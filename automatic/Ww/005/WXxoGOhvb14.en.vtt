00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.469
 Rainbow and radiant before their 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.420
 oppressors their faces shine because 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.339
 they know that their redeemer with his huge 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.570

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.220
 all the lineages of the earth are 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.220

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.860
 I may have heard every person in the 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.810
 planet earth is witness to this 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.330
 wonderful event and most are 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.610
 terrified by that 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.710
 the evil ones flee desperately to the 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.270
 rocks and caves trying in vain to 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.480
 hide from the realization that 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.000
 approximate and as jesus promised the 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.970
 evil ones who were prominent leaders of 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.280
 his trial and crucifixion are raised 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.060
 of the tombs so that they contemplate the 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.060
 crucified 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.049
 because the same gentleman will descend from 

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:43.380

 dead in Christ will resurrect first 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.430
 a loud trumpet was heard 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.560
 resound through the heavens and the powerful voice 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.850
 of the savior calls his saints of all 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.130
 the ages that sleep saying 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:06.409
 awakened awakened those who 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.409
 we sleep in the dust and get up 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.040
 throughout the land a great army of 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.560
 saints rises from their beds in the 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.920

 immortal without a face of illness and 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.210
 deformity then those that 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.880
 they lived during the test time are 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.430

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.910

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.250
 that we have been left we will be raptured 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.500
 together with them in the clouds to receive 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.790
 to the lord in the air and so we will be 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.920
 always with the lord 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.260
 like the world in convulsion under 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.030
 they the redeemed of the earth escape 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.579
 and they rise above the 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.530

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.970
 has been forever removed and 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:18.739
 they contemplate their god and their angels 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.739
