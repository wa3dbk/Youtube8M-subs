exposed the fuel filter right there

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.560 
exposed the fuel filter right there
pretty<00:00:18.750> easy<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.920> access<00:00:20.130> from<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.150> past

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
pretty easy to to access from the past

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.349 
pretty easy to to access from the past
off<00:00:21.869> from<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.289> passenger<00:00:22.650> side<00:00:22.920> now<00:00:23.359> tanks

unhook this one let me see if I can like

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.590 
unhook this one let me see if I can like
this<00:00:35.820> one<00:00:36.030> right<00:00:36.180> here

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
this one right here

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.810 
this one right here
from<00:00:36.870> this<00:00:37.050> little<00:00:37.230> sensor<00:00:37.500> which<00:00:38.399> goes<00:00:38.640> into

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
from this little sensor which goes into

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.459 
from this little sensor which goes into
the<00:00:39.000> filter<00:00:39.329> before<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.690> even<00:00:39.930> do<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.140> right

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
the filter before you even do that right

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.440 
the filter before you even do that right
here<00:00:41.190> on<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.460> bottom<00:00:41.640> side<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.239> see<00:00:42.390> this

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
here on the bottom side you see this

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.810 
here on the bottom side you see this
little<00:00:42.690> thing<00:00:42.809> right<00:00:43.110> here<00:00:43.309> it<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.520> kind<00:00:44.789> of

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
little thing right here it is kind of

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.760 
little thing right here it is kind of
like<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.000> release<00:00:45.480> valve<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:46.020> release<00:00:46.050> whatever

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
like a release valve to release whatever

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.959 
like a release valve to release whatever
excess<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.399> fuel<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.210> inside<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.890> filter<00:00:49.969> once

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
excess of fuel is inside the filter once

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.600 
excess of fuel is inside the filter once
the<00:00:51.300> cable<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.660> removed<00:00:51.960> from<00:00:52.050> here<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:53.100> it's

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
the cable is removed from here and it's

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.750 
the cable is removed from here and it's
hanging<00:00:54.480> free<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.890> have<00:00:56.039> removed<00:00:56.520> the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
hanging free and you have removed the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.229 
hanging free and you have removed the
excess<00:00:57.149> off<00:00:57.590> this<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:58.770> then<00:00:59.699> you<00:00:59.879> can<00:01:00.059> go<00:01:00.180> ahead

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
excess off this so then you can go ahead

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.209 
excess off this so then you can go ahead
and<00:01:00.570> unscrew<00:01:00.719> with<00:01:01.350> your<00:01:01.500> hands<00:01:01.710> because<00:01:02.070> it's

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
and unscrew with your hands because it's

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.240 
and unscrew with your hands because it's
basically<00:01:02.460> like<00:01:02.640> hand<00:01:02.910> tight<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:04.250> fuel

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
basically like hand tight the fuel

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.090 
basically like hand tight the fuel
filter<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.760> then<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:07.080> comes<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.590> new<00:01:07.710> one<00:01:07.860> comes

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
filter and then it comes a new one comes

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.520 
filter and then it comes a new one comes
with<00:01:08.280> two<00:01:08.490> seals<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.450> what<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:09.900> do<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.170> just

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
with two seals and what you do is just

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.859 
with two seals and what you do is just
get<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.740> seals<00:01:11.040> at<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.939> rubber<00:01:12.119> bands<00:01:12.689> that

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
get the seals at the rubber bands that

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.359 
get the seals at the rubber bands that
comes<00:01:13.049> with<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.380> seals<00:01:13.619> or<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.220> rubber

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
comes with the seals or the rubber

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.609 
comes with the seals or the rubber
o-rings<00:01:14.909> um<00:01:15.750> since<00:01:16.290> they're<00:01:16.380> going<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.560> be

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
o-rings um since they're going to be

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.429 
o-rings um since they're going to be
exposed<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.070> fuel<00:01:17.400> all<00:01:17.580> this'll<00:01:18.229> just<00:01:19.229> get

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
exposed to fuel all this'll just get

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.109 
exposed to fuel all this'll just get
them<00:01:19.530> wetting<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.400> then<00:01:20.729> go<00:01:20.909> ahead<00:01:20.970> and

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
them wetting this and then go ahead and

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.789 
them wetting this and then go ahead and
the<00:01:21.540> smallest<00:01:21.840> one<00:01:22.020> goes<00:01:22.470> at<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.710> bottom

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
the smallest one goes at the bottom

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.780 
the smallest one goes at the bottom
right<00:01:23.040> here<00:01:23.189> when<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.520> remove<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:25.790> when

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
right here when you remove this and when

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.999 
right here when you remove this and when
you<00:01:26.909> tie<00:01:27.119> down<00:01:27.330> on<00:01:27.479> tie<00:01:27.990> this<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.710> just

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
you tie down on tie this you is just

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.920 
you tie down on tie this you is just
hand<00:01:29.310> tight<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.549> don't<00:01:29.850> want<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.090> like<00:01:30.240> over

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
hand tight you don't want to like over

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.200 
hand tight you don't want to like over
time<00:01:31.079> you're<00:01:31.439> going<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.619> break<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.979> sensor<00:01:32.340> up

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
time you're going to break the sensor up

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.640 
time you're going to break the sensor up
on<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.570> top<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.869> just<00:01:34.049> kind<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.259> like<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.409> screw

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
on the top is just kind of like a screw

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.920 
on the top is just kind of like a screw
and<00:01:34.770> back<00:01:34.890> up<00:01:35.070> fuel<00:01:35.520> filter<00:01:35.790> no<00:01:36.450> fuel<00:01:36.659> filter

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
and back up fuel filter no fuel filter

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.140 
and back up fuel filter no fuel filter
but<00:01:37.079> oil<00:01:37.320> filter<00:01:37.710> once<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.579> get<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.790> like<00:01:38.909> hand

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
but oil filter once you get it like hand

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.390 
but oil filter once you get it like hand
tight<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.600> it's<00:01:40.500> tight<00:01:40.710> enough<00:01:40.740> then<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.280> go

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
tight and it's tight enough then you go

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.700 
tight and it's tight enough then you go
ahead<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.790> proceed<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.150> reconnect<00:01:43.049> the

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
ahead and proceed to reconnect the

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.249 
ahead and proceed to reconnect the
sensor<00:01:44.280> back<00:01:44.490> into<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.259> electrical

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
sensor back into the electrical

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.289 
sensor back into the electrical
connector<00:01:46.619> right<00:01:46.740> here<00:01:46.939> once<00:01:47.939> that's<00:01:48.119> done

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
connector right here once that's done

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.749

this is the primer what you do is you

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.730 
this is the primer what you do is you
pump<00:02:11.700> this

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
pump this

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.060 
pump this
dang<00:02:13.580> right<00:02:13.760> here<00:02:13.970> like<00:02:14.900> 25<00:02:15.380> times<00:02:15.590> once<00:02:15.950> he

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
dang right here like 25 times once he

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.350 
dang right here like 25 times once he
gets<00:02:16.250> hard<00:02:16.430> where<00:02:16.580> you<00:02:16.700> can<00:02:16.850> put<00:02:17.030> no<00:02:17.150> more<00:02:17.300> on

tight a little bit until you release the
air<00:02:24.380> pressure<00:02:24.410> it<00:02:24.920> goes<00:02:25.130> like<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:26.750> entire

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
air pressure it goes like the entire

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.770 
air pressure it goes like the entire
backup<00:02:27.440> pump<00:02:28.310> like<00:02:28.520> 25<00:02:28.910> times<00:02:29.120> when<00:02:29.510> it<00:02:29.600> gets

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780

hard enough again release the pressure

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.840 
hard enough again release the pressure
from<00:02:32.300> here<00:02:32.570> use<00:02:32.780> a<00:02:32.810> big<00:02:33.170> screw<00:02:33.590> a<00:02:33.850> flat

so<00:02:36.620> that<00:02:36.770> way<00:02:36.830> you<00:02:36.890> don't<00:02:37.040> mess<00:02:37.220> up<00:02:37.340> because

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
so that way you don't mess up because

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.330 
so that way you don't mess up because
it's<00:02:37.730> plastic<00:02:38.590> once<00:02:39.590> you<00:02:39.740> release<00:02:40.010> the

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
it's plastic once you release the

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.000 
it's plastic once you release the
pressure<00:02:41.090> pump<00:02:41.870> like<00:02:42.050> 25<00:02:42.410> more<00:02:42.530> times<00:02:42.770> and

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
pressure pump like 25 more times and

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.860 
pressure pump like 25 more times and
then<00:02:43.640> release<00:02:43.970> again<00:02:44.150> once<00:02:44.450> you<00:02:44.570> see<00:02:44.750> this

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
then release again once you see this

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.170 
then release again once you see this
will<00:02:45.050> start<00:02:45.230> coming<00:02:45.410> out<00:02:45.640> then<00:02:46.640> tie<00:02:46.970> it<00:02:47.030> back

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
will start coming out then tie it back

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.870 
will start coming out then tie it back
up<00:02:47.390> pump<00:02:48.110> like<00:02:48.320> on<00:02:48.560> to<00:02:49.010> you<00:02:49.160> come<00:02:49.340> up<00:02:49.460> pump<00:02:49.700> no

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
up pump like on to you come up pump no

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.550 
up pump like on to you come up pump no
more<00:02:50.090> where<00:02:50.510> it<00:02:50.540> gets<00:02:50.750> really<00:02:50.900> hard<00:02:51.140> and<00:02:51.320> then

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
more where it gets really hard and then

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.080 
more where it gets really hard and then
you're<00:02:51.710> good<00:02:51.920> to<00:02:52.070> go<00:02:52.100> then<00:02:52.460> start<00:02:52.730> the<00:02:52.790> vehicle

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
you're good to go then start the vehicle

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.530 
you're good to go then start the vehicle
alright<00:02:54.050> so<00:02:54.230> let's<00:02:54.410> go<00:02:54.500> ahead<00:02:54.560> and<00:02:54.680> start<00:02:55.040> it

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
alright so let's go ahead and start it

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.850 
alright so let's go ahead and start it
once<00:02:56.540> I<00:02:56.660> change<00:02:56.990> the<00:02:58.630> fuel<00:02:59.630> filter<00:03:00.470> on<00:03:00.680> the

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
once I change the fuel filter on the

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.670 
once I change the fuel filter on the
vehicle<00:03:01.190> and<00:03:01.490> let's<00:03:02.360> see<00:03:02.510> if<00:03:02.630> it<00:03:02.750> starts<00:03:02.990> right

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
vehicle and let's see if it starts right

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.640 
vehicle and let's see if it starts right
away<00:03:05.350> so<00:03:06.400> once<00:03:07.400> you<00:03:07.520> get<00:03:07.670> a<00:03:07.700> start<00:03:08.060> up<00:03:08.620> what<00:03:09.620> I

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
away so once you get a start up what I

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.860 
away so once you get a start up what I
do<00:03:09.740> is<00:03:09.950> I<00:03:10.040> like<00:03:10.160> to<00:03:10.220> go<00:03:10.460> and<00:03:10.550> reset<00:03:11.030> the

do is I like to go and reset the

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.110 
do is I like to go and reset the
percentage<00:03:12.440> on<00:03:12.710> the<00:03:13.400> field<00:03:13.700> field<00:03:13.820> to<00:03:14.030> the

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
percentage on the field field to the

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.460 
percentage on the field field to the
reason<00:03:14.390> I'm<00:03:14.480> doing<00:03:14.600> is<00:03:14.780> because<00:03:15.080> I'm<00:03:15.230> going<00:03:15.380> to
