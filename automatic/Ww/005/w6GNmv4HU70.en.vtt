00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 Oh 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.440
 this is an insanely important car 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.840
 last time where not only 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.020
 the netherlands but global 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.660
 jaguar very much how you should 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:24.900
 grow to survive in one 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:27.390
 Titanic battle between car manufacturers 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.850
 are still a decent size for us 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.399
 smaller than the other premium brands and 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.469
 as always look say the 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.570
 challenger's in the frome and the 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.780
 German 3 in the smolia four we will 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.819
 c-class bmw 3 series 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.629
 time car naturally had a model 

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:47.290
 in this segment meter x the pilot is busy 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.060
 aesthetically-based connected 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.430
 oh and everybody knows that yo 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.470
 actually worn very long after it 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.380
 in the end all pretty well 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.160
 good cars but nothing is a total 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.160
 another beast 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.869
 did there i said jack ran there 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.330
 because you have a continuous connection between them 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.200
 also technically something 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.850
 similarities with then were whole 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.970
 other cars 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.250
 very nice on the xe more than 70% of the 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.409
 choice is made of aluminum 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.350
 every team has it significantly lighter 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:26.180
 but none is with what 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.180
 we are very killing on a lighter 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.050
 yes, perhaps a leader in this segment 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.110
 and we will bake them a lot of attention 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.780
 spends on the lion 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.710
 the car that smoke is very quiet 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.630
 claim 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.160
 quietest in its class we have one 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.260
 while with mat different verses 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:48.150
 driven and I believe that is just 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.150
 nice and quiet here opinion 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.410
 in terms of engines are number of sentences 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.550
 important for the Dutch market and 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.040
 probably also for the belgian 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.330
 market namely the diesels no wait 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.670
 not eh 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.820
 there are two with 20% in the number 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.290
 we have 2 liters of diesel with 163 hp 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.770
 with manual gearbox 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.200
 cetera has 99 grams of co2 loud 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:17.040
 So those are amply and aggregation 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:20.220
 but even 180 hp diesel with automatic transmission 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.730
 has had a lot with little though 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.850
 still 20% addition 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.310
 now with 180 hp diesel with automatic transmission 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.920
 package condition supercat with no 20 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.940
 there are good power at the ring 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.950
 do not press further 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.020
 tests found youngsters 7 or 8 seconds 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.150
 below it to a slave of two years 28 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.190
 kilometers 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.420
 a piece of highway was me because you 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.060
 down the hill and went ample 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.630
 it is easy to get over it 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.650
 also a 163 hp version is just smooth 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.079
 enough 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.720
 come three school years below the in top 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:56.879
 then a layer is only barbed wire you 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:01.220
 but this time it appears to be very large 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:01.220
 227 his shield only once meters 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.740
 if someone circling the familiar in 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.630
 the 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.940
 openwork model what stijn is the 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.590
 performance use the sat and twin turbo 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.700
 just like that they don't have anything left 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.410
 say 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.910
 more offensive about the two each other 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.310
 can go 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.110
 We also see that again 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.530
 all 25 cents addition is therefore 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.960
 do not continue to stand still for too long 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:47.880
 addition you are 3 variants vols 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:51.750
 two more turbos four cylinders 244 hp 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.700
 and this is touching with superchart 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.980
 just a wonderful clock 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.990
 very couple rich just from the bottom 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.210
 just nice up 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.770
 upstairs in maybe less tasty it 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.880
 something you just do 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.410
 but 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.250
 people who coat 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:10.500
 but 340 HP so our skin very much 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.530
 adjusted to 250 kilometers because 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.340
 the two a turbo with 42 he has 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.459
 namely 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:20.290
 open adjusted to such as mm 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.370
 100 ms as the winner 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.690
 come in a second 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.690
 on is just then 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.029
 hairdresser was my diode is find one 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:50.310
 vending machine and I notice that every time 

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:52.349
 acceleration higher goal determine turns 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.439
 I went there for the sake of it 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:57.120
 inventing enzyme will be 70 the back 

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:59.669
 don't think that is 3 but 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.250
 how good these four are already on that 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:03.750
 couple already delicious from boxmeer 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:08.040
 then you also notice the way to van 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:10.960
 xe is just really very often 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:14.350
 nicely balanced aldo 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.210
 but it was murder that gives 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.900
 very confident also with 3 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.900
 each other under what 

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:22.580
 you just seem 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.610
 married to send 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:28.330
 tasty send you even once they really 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.330
 very cool 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:35.870
 knowing the styles industries i 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:38.180
 always a little personal I think 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.890
 you'll have all I have to win too 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.080
 yes it is not even a new one 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:44.660
 more moon the family money yeah but now 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.000
 enter the and rat with an i stand i am 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.950
 for you would you say that round 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.170
 headlight you are not a my white again 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:54.530
 pronounced classic styling 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:56.170
 it is now much more from me to me 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.220
 now it doesn't feel completely jaguar 

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:00.620
 specific and it and that must be another 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.600
 maybe a little grow with me but me 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.910
 do look sleek but like the 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.800
 other and bitches would have had gait 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.390
 We also speak to believe 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.150
 margin might need a little bit 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:13.630
 really have a face of their own 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:16.450
 interior finish is just doing that 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:18.280
 nicely done nice materials we do 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:20.770
 a version a nice leather upholstery 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.990
 electric seats and a wal-mart tong 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:26.410
 looks like truck card 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:28.660
 navigation system this is the new version 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.580
 still my touch screen but 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.100
 some more buttons past with the previous one 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.230
 generation of the navigation system to 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:42.760
 still in Iran to their real 

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:45.280
 bit awkwardly switched halfway through the 

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:47.050
 ride say s found her my diesel 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:50.110
 and high rating 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:51.190
 yes you liver and heaven pkc 160 piece for 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.080
 to be precise 

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:55.240
 that is normal reason for my role to 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.760
 hear chad make just drive 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.600
 really 

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:03.090
 tasty ones so for this type of car and 

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.830
 new diesel in gini you the new 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:07.140
 motorbikes family that already there 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:09.120
 development of the rahal of course 

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.410
 only my journal members and everywhere 

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.870
 leg wants in engines 

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:15.660
 by markvoort and now they go own 

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:17.460
 engines and say also develop whole 

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.800
 not to drop the ear works to 

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:22.320
 worth 500 million pied, they are 

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:24.400
 pretty serious in deploying the 

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.960
 course 

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.699
 probably only me at first 

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.139
 just to mention the price for the 

00:07:27.699 --> 00:07:32.919
 dutch get there with the belgian 

00:07:29.139 --> 00:07:33.400
 prices frankly no because from 40 

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:36.340
 new 

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.750
 then you have the seat 2 liters of diesel 163 

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.610
 pk 

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:41.310
 manual transmission 

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:44.990
 monique a lot of options but it is 

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:44.990
 best then an instant
