00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
obviously some extra wire that you'll

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.410 
obviously some extra wire that you'll
need<00:01:22.650> because<00:01:22.860> it's<00:01:23.340> not<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.119> not<00:01:24.150> gonna

need because it's not this is not gonna
be<00:01:24.479> enough<00:01:24.630> wire<00:01:24.810> for<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.140> so<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.220> first<00:01:26.460> step

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
be enough wire for you so the first step

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.350 
be enough wire for you so the first step
to<00:01:26.729> putting<00:01:27.330> your<00:01:27.630> custom<00:01:28.170> LEDs<00:01:28.560> in<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:30.090> to

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
to putting your custom LEDs in is to

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.990

is splice these two wires drill a hole

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.770 
is splice these two wires drill a hole
in<00:03:18.870> here<00:03:19.560> to<00:03:20.069> mount<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.459> LED<00:03:20.579> and<00:03:21.060> run<00:03:21.660> this

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
in here to mount the LED and run this

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.920 
in here to mount the LED and run this
wire<00:03:22.250> through<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.370> back<00:03:23.579> of<00:03:23.760> this<00:03:23.849> panel<00:03:24.180> into

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
wire through the back of this panel into

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.920 
wire through the back of this panel into
here<00:03:25.139> and<00:03:25.290> connect<00:03:25.560> it<00:03:26.329> now<00:03:27.329> you<00:03:27.419> can<00:03:27.540> see<00:03:27.750> here

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
here and connect it now you can see here

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.890 
here and connect it now you can see here
I<00:03:27.959> kind<00:03:28.260> of<00:03:28.349> extended<00:03:28.859> these<00:03:29.010> wires<00:03:29.310> out<00:03:29.900> but

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
I kind of extended these wires out but

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.020 
I kind of extended these wires out but
to<00:03:31.109> splice<00:03:31.349> them<00:03:31.590> or<00:03:32.519> use<00:03:32.730> one<00:03:32.910> of<00:03:32.940> these

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
to splice them or use one of these

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.949 
to splice them or use one of these
things<00:03:33.329> here<00:03:34.819> and<00:03:35.819> see<00:03:36.060> that<00:03:36.209> correctly<00:03:38.959> they

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
things here and see that correctly they

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.809 
things here and see that correctly they
can<00:03:39.989> get<00:03:40.410> from<00:03:40.650> my<00:03:42.109> radio<00:03:43.109> shack<00:03:43.560> for

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:43.819 
can get from my radio shack for

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.640 
can get from my radio shack for
practically<00:03:44.819> nothing<00:03:45.299> and<00:03:45.480> basically<00:03:46.470> how

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
practically nothing and basically how

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.780 
practically nothing and basically how
this<00:03:46.859> works<00:03:46.919> is<00:03:47.660> you<00:03:48.660> take<00:03:48.690> two<00:03:49.639> ends<00:03:50.639> of<00:03:50.699> the

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
this works is you take two ends of the

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.720 
this works is you take two ends of the
wire<00:03:50.819> put<00:03:51.540> it<00:03:51.660> in<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.900> two<00:03:52.079> metal<00:03:52.410> holes<00:03:52.730> and

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
wire put it in the two metal holes and

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.430 
wire put it in the two metal holes and
you<00:03:53.819> take<00:03:54.030> your<00:03:54.209> wiring<00:03:54.419> splice<00:03:54.959> and<00:03:55.139> put<00:03:55.349> in

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
you take your wiring splice and put in

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.369 
you take your wiring splice and put in
here<00:03:56.180> I'll<00:03:57.180> show<00:03:57.359> you<00:03:57.419> an<00:03:57.480> example<00:03:57.599> of<00:03:58.079> it<00:03:58.260> in

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
here I'll show you an example of it in

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:02.420 
here I'll show you an example of it in
action<00:03:58.769> here<00:03:59.599> and<00:04:00.599> we<00:04:00.690> have<00:04:00.930> this<00:04:01.440> wire<00:04:01.799> cut<00:04:02.160> we

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
action here and we have this wire cut we

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.180 
action here and we have this wire cut we
already<00:04:02.699> cut<00:04:02.879> the<00:04:03.530> black<00:04:04.530> and<00:04:04.739> white<00:04:04.829> striped

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
already cut the black and white striped

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.250 
already cut the black and white striped
wire<00:04:05.430> and<00:04:05.669> splice<00:04:06.000> it<00:04:06.030> in<00:04:06.299> there<00:04:06.510> and<00:04:07.079> I<00:04:07.230> just

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
wire and splice it in there and I just

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.720 
wire and splice it in there and I just
wrapped<00:04:07.590> a<00:04:07.709> little<00:04:07.919> duct<00:04:08.069> tape<00:04:08.280> around<00:04:08.489> it<00:04:08.669> I'm

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
wrapped a little duct tape around it I'm

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.640 
wrapped a little duct tape around it I'm
probably<00:04:08.940> gonna<00:04:09.120> protect<00:04:09.540> the<00:04:10.199> rest<00:04:10.410> of<00:04:10.530> it

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
probably gonna protect the rest of it

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.250 
probably gonna protect the rest of it
duct<00:04:10.889> tape<00:04:11.069> as<00:04:11.310> well<00:04:11.840> then<00:04:12.840> all<00:04:12.930> you<00:04:13.049> need<00:04:13.169> to

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
duct tape as well then all you need to

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.470 
duct tape as well then all you need to
do<00:04:13.379> is<00:04:13.530> use<00:04:13.680> your<00:04:13.849> ante<00:04:14.849> little<00:04:15.060> crimp<00:04:15.269> tool

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
do is use your ante little crimp tool

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.110 
do is use your ante little crimp tool
and<00:04:15.510> crimp<00:04:15.780> it<00:04:16.079> down<00:04:16.139> and<00:04:16.590> it<00:04:17.370> is<00:04:17.489> secure<00:04:17.940> we

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
and crimp it down and it is secure we

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.849 
and crimp it down and it is secure we
have<00:04:18.269> the<00:04:18.389> whole<00:04:18.539> assembly<00:04:19.079> connected

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
have the whole assembly connected

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.650 
have the whole assembly connected
together<00:04:20.120> to<00:04:21.120> the<00:04:21.209> LED<00:04:21.599> they're<00:04:21.840> gonna<00:04:22.019> extend

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
together to the LED they're gonna extend

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.090 
together to the LED they're gonna extend
because<00:04:22.930> the<00:04:23.080> wires<00:04:23.500> that<00:04:23.710> came<00:04:23.920> with<00:04:24.040> it

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
because the wires that came with it

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.060 
because the wires that came with it
weren't<00:04:24.310> long<00:04:24.490> enough<00:04:24.760> and<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:26.530> connection

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
weren't long enough and the connection

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.710 
weren't long enough and the connection
into<00:04:27.310> the<00:04:27.780> taillight<00:04:28.780> assembly<00:04:28.810> there<00:04:30.720> to

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
into the taillight assembly there to

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:39.390 
into the taillight assembly there to
make<00:04:31.900> sure<00:04:32.110> that<00:04:32.260> this<00:04:32.440> works<00:04:37.500> one<00:04:38.500> purple<00:04:38.950> LED

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
make sure that this works one purple LED

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.130 
make sure that this works one purple LED
and<00:04:39.700> tail<00:04:40.060> light<00:04:40.270> on<00:04:40.420> at<00:04:40.570> the<00:04:40.630> same<00:04:40.840> time<00:04:41.670> now

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
and tail light on at the same time now

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.650 
and tail light on at the same time now
it's<00:04:44.140> a<00:04:44.260> daylight<00:04:44.680> out<00:04:45.150> it's<00:04:46.150> kind<00:04:46.390> of<00:04:46.420> hard<00:04:46.600> to

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
it's a daylight out it's kind of hard to

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.450 
it's a daylight out it's kind of hard to
tell<00:04:46.900> how<00:04:47.080> bright<00:04:47.350> this<00:04:47.500> actually<00:04:47.950> will<00:04:48.070> be<00:04:48.220> at

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
tell how bright this actually will be at

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.640 
tell how bright this actually will be at
night<00:04:48.760> when<00:04:48.940> we<00:04:49.060> have<00:04:49.270> our<00:04:49.420> lights<00:04:49.630> on<00:04:49.840> so<00:04:50.620> I

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
night when we have our lights on so I

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.060 
night when we have our lights on so I
recommend<00:04:51.250> before<00:04:52.230> finalize<00:04:53.230> along<00:04:53.560> this<00:04:53.770> all

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
recommend before finalize along this all

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.460 
recommend before finalize along this all
of<00:04:54.280> this<00:04:54.400> together<00:04:54.610> and<00:04:55.120> putting<00:04:55.450> this<00:04:55.660> you

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
of this together and putting this you

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:57.960 
of this together and putting this you
know<00:04:56.560> drilling<00:04:57.100> a<00:04:57.160> hole<00:04:57.190> in<00:04:57.460> here<00:04:57.700> putting<00:04:57.880> the

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
know drilling a hole in here putting the

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.120 
know drilling a hole in here putting the
wire<00:04:58.150> on<00:04:58.360> the<00:04:58.450> paneling<00:04:58.870> and<00:04:58.990> everything<00:04:59.380> to

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
wire on the paneling and everything to

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.890 
wire on the paneling and everything to
really<00:05:00.400> test<00:05:00.610> this<00:05:00.760> out<00:05:00.910> at<00:05:01.060> night<00:05:01.240> first<00:05:01.510> just

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
really test this out at night first just

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.320 
really test this out at night first just
to<00:05:01.990> make<00:05:02.020> sure<00:05:02.200> that<00:05:02.670> really<00:05:03.670> what<00:05:03.790> you<00:05:03.910> want

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
to make sure that really what you want

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.700 
to make sure that really what you want
you<00:05:04.570> know<00:05:04.660> and<00:05:04.840> test<00:05:05.050> a<00:05:05.170> placement<00:05:05.650> of

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
you know and test a placement of

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.770 
you know and test a placement of
different<00:05:05.980> areas<00:05:06.130> because<00:05:06.610> different<00:05:07.420> areas

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
different areas because different areas

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.240 
different areas because different areas
can<00:05:07.930> create<00:05:08.230> different<00:05:08.590> shades<00:05:08.890> and

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
can create different shades and

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.190 
can create different shades and
interesting<00:05:10.180> effects<00:05:10.480> around<00:05:10.690> the<00:05:10.840> car<00:05:11.020> so

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
interesting effects around the car so

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.770 
interesting effects around the car so
yeah<00:05:11.530> we<00:05:11.740> drilled<00:05:12.010> a<00:05:12.130> quarter-inch<00:05:12.460> hole<00:05:12.820> and

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
yeah we drilled a quarter-inch hole and

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.050 
yeah we drilled a quarter-inch hole and
we<00:05:13.930> have<00:05:14.080> these<00:05:14.230> little<00:05:14.470> LED<00:05:15.370> holders<00:05:15.970> that

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
we have these little LED holders that

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.340 
we have these little LED holders that
you<00:05:16.150> can<00:05:16.270> get<00:05:16.420> from<00:05:16.510> RadioShack<00:05:16.840> that<00:05:17.260> are

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
you can get from RadioShack that are

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.220 
you can get from RadioShack that are
also<00:05:17.500> 1/4<00:05:17.950> inch<00:05:18.130> and<00:05:18.310> they<00:05:18.400> hold<00:05:18.660> any<00:05:19.660> five<00:05:20.020> or

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:20.230 
also 1/4 inch and they hold any five or

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.790 
also 1/4 inch and they hold any five or
three<00:05:20.440> or<00:05:20.770> eight<00:05:21.610> millimeter<00:05:22.120> LEDs<00:05:22.800> and

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
three or eight millimeter LEDs and

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.550 
three or eight millimeter LEDs and
basically<00:05:24.130> you're<00:05:24.220> gonna<00:05:24.310> want<00:05:24.550> to<00:05:24.610> put<00:05:24.790> this

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
basically you're gonna want to put this

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.550 
basically you're gonna want to put this
in<00:05:26.560> a<00:05:26.920> hole<00:05:27.870> so<00:05:28.870> you<00:05:28.960> have<00:05:29.050> something<00:05:29.410> to

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
in a hole so you have something to

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.800 
in a hole so you have something to
secure<00:05:29.920> l-82<00:05:31.980> you<00:05:32.980> just<00:05:33.220> run<00:05:33.490> these<00:05:33.700> wires

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
secure l-82 you just run these wires

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.700 
secure l-82 you just run these wires
from<00:05:34.810> led<00:05:36.240> down<00:05:37.240> through<00:05:37.600> here<00:05:37.900> and<00:05:38.080> it'll

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
from led down through here and it'll

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.820 
from led down through here and it'll
come<00:05:39.450> behind<00:05:40.450> the<00:05:40.690> paneling<00:05:41.200> down<00:05:41.440> here<00:05:41.740> you

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
come behind the paneling down here you

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.550 
come behind the paneling down here you
may<00:05:41.980> have<00:05:42.010> to<00:05:42.160> reach<00:05:42.430> your<00:05:42.580> hand<00:05:42.880> up<00:05:43.090> and<00:05:43.570> hear

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
may have to reach your hand up and hear

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.230 
may have to reach your hand up and hear
it<00:05:44.650> and<00:05:44.710> pull<00:05:44.950> it<00:05:44.980> down<00:05:45.100> now<00:05:45.670> the<00:05:45.730> passenger's

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
it and pull it down now the passenger's

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.670 
it and pull it down now the passenger's
side<00:05:46.420> is<00:05:46.600> significantly<00:05:47.200> more<00:05:47.290> tricky

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
side is significantly more tricky

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.970 
side is significantly more tricky
because<00:05:47.920> only<00:05:48.790> part<00:05:49.000> of<00:05:49.060> the<00:05:49.150> panel<00:05:49.420> comes<00:05:49.630> out

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:49.980 
because only part of the panel comes out

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:54.150 
because only part of the panel comes out
so<00:05:50.980> I<00:05:51.310> had<00:05:51.640> a<00:05:51.700> crazy<00:05:51.940> idea<00:05:52.360> and<00:05:52.710> I<00:05:53.710> put<00:05:53.980> this

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 
so I had a crazy idea and I put this

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.830 
so I had a crazy idea and I put this
solder<00:05:54.520> wire<00:05:54.730> I<00:05:54.760> fed<00:05:55.210> it<00:05:55.330> up<00:05:55.420> through<00:05:55.720> this

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
solder wire I fed it up through this

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.960 
solder wire I fed it up through this
hole<00:05:55.900> here<00:05:56.250> and<00:05:57.250> kind<00:05:57.400> of<00:05:57.490> caught<00:05:57.730> it<00:05:57.850> with<00:05:57.910> my

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:57.970 
hole here and kind of caught it with my

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.410 
hole here and kind of caught it with my
hand<00:05:58.330> through<00:05:59.290> here<00:05:59.650> and<00:05:59.910> what<00:06:00.910> I<00:06:00.940> did<00:06:01.150> is<00:06:01.300> I

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:01.420 
hand through here and what I did is I

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.740 
hand through here and what I did is I
put<00:06:01.450> the<00:06:01.750> LED<00:06:02.080> in<00:06:02.670> here<00:06:03.670> fish<00:06:04.150> this<00:06:04.360> wire<00:06:04.570> out

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
put the LED in here fish this wire out

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.770 
put the LED in here fish this wire out
and<00:06:04.900> tied<00:06:05.470> them<00:06:05.560> together<00:06:05.740> and<00:06:06.480> hopes<00:06:07.480> is<00:06:07.750> I

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:07.780 
and tied them together and hopes is I

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.370 
and tied them together and hopes is I
can<00:06:08.140> just<00:06:08.170> pull<00:06:08.500> these<00:06:08.650> through<00:06:10.110> this<00:06:11.110> hole

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:11.380 
can just pull these through this hole

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:12.810 
can just pull these through this hole
and<00:06:11.560> get<00:06:11.710> the<00:06:11.830> wire<00:06:11.980> to<00:06:12.130> come<00:06:12.250> out<00:06:12.370> here<00:06:12.640> and

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:12.820 
and get the wire to come out here and

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.580 
and get the wire to come out here and
all<00:06:13.060> I<00:06:13.120> have<00:06:13.300> to<00:06:13.420> do<00:06:13.510> is<00:06:13.600> get<00:06:13.780> a<00:06:13.810> wire<00:06:14.020> from<00:06:14.170> here

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590 
all I have to do is get a wire from here

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.640 
all I have to do is get a wire from here
to<00:06:15.160> here<00:06:15.400> at<00:06:15.490> this<00:06:15.640> point<00:06:16.110> one<00:06:17.110> trick<00:06:17.440> is<00:06:17.560> to

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:17.650 
to here at this point one trick is to

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.220 
to here at this point one trick is to
make<00:06:17.890> sure<00:06:18.070> though<00:06:18.490> that<00:06:19.120> your<00:06:19.480> wire<00:06:19.780> from<00:06:20.170> the

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:20.230 
make sure though that your wire from the

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.050 
make sure though that your wire from the
LED<00:06:20.530> is<00:06:20.740> coming<00:06:21.010> out<00:06:21.130> from<00:06:21.310> the<00:06:21.460> right<00:06:21.670> side<00:06:21.940> of

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 
LED is coming out from the right side of

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.730 
LED is coming out from the right side of
the<00:06:22.120> seatbelt<00:06:22.570> or<00:06:22.720> it's<00:06:22.840> gonna<00:06:23.080> chafe<00:06:23.410> against

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:23.740 
the seatbelt or it's gonna chafe against

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.310 
the seatbelt or it's gonna chafe against
the<00:06:23.890> seatbelt
