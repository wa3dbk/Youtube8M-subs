okay<00:00:08.910> so<00:00:09.240> today<00:00:09.480> we're<00:00:09.720> replacing<00:00:10.080> the

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 
okay so today we're replacing the

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.060 
okay so today we're replacing the
steering<00:00:11.730> stabilizer<00:00:12.950> basically<00:00:13.950> we're

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
steering stabilizer basically we're

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.160 
steering stabilizer basically we're
underneath<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.519> Jeep<00:00:14.880> Grand<00:00:14.910> Cherokee<00:00:15.630> now

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
underneath the Jeep Grand Cherokee now

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.780 
underneath the Jeep Grand Cherokee now
the<00:00:16.230> steering<00:00:16.650> stabilizer<00:00:16.830> is<00:00:17.369> this<00:00:17.580> guy

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:17.790 
the steering stabilizer is this guy

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.980 
the steering stabilizer is this guy
right<00:00:18.000> here<00:00:18.380> I'm<00:00:19.380> just<00:00:19.650> kind<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:19.860> attaches<00:00:20.990> to

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
right here I'm just kind of attaches to

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.470 
right here I'm just kind of attaches to
mill<00:00:22.199> this<00:00:22.440> bar<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.220> then<00:00:23.490> on<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.880> on<00:00:24.300> the

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
mill this bar and then on the on the

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.630 
mill this bar and then on the on the
frame<00:00:24.779> right<00:00:24.960> here<00:00:25.020> as<00:00:25.260> well<00:00:25.500> I'm<00:00:26.220> it's<00:00:26.490> right

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
frame right here as well I'm it's right

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.890 
frame right here as well I'm it's right
above<00:00:26.850> the<00:00:27.000> track<00:00:27.240> bar<00:00:27.980> so<00:00:28.980> mine<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.900> it's

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
above the track bar so mine is a it's

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.770 
above the track bar so mine is a it's
one<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.350> death<00:00:31.560> wobble<00:00:31.800> fixes<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:33.570> can

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
one of the death wobble fixes you can

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.450 
one of the death wobble fixes you can
say<00:00:34.020> usually<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.710> track<00:00:34.980> bar

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
say usually is the track bar

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.680 
say usually is the track bar
I'm<00:00:35.550> also<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.059> steering<00:00:36.449> stabilizer

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
I'm also the steering stabilizer

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.889 
I'm also the steering stabilizer
sometimes<00:00:37.649> an<00:00:37.800> alignment<00:00:38.070> can<00:00:38.430> cause<00:00:38.640> it

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
sometimes an alignment can cause it

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.040 
sometimes an alignment can cause it
basically<00:00:39.899> anything<00:00:40.820> that<00:00:41.820> has<00:00:42.239> play<00:00:42.660> in<00:00:42.840> it's

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
basically anything that has play in it's

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.950 
basically anything that has play in it's
like<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.710> see<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.850> track<00:00:45.120> bar<00:00:45.329> sometimes<00:00:45.780> has

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
like you see the track bar sometimes has

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.620 
like you see the track bar sometimes has
some<00:00:46.170> play<00:00:46.410> here<00:00:46.680> in<00:00:46.770> this<00:00:46.920> bushing<00:00:47.360> in<00:00:48.360> my

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:48.630 
some play here in this bushing in my

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.860 
some play here in this bushing in my
case<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.170> was<00:00:49.380> not<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.770> cause<00:00:50.870> sometimes

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
case this was not the cause sometimes

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.840 
case this was not the cause sometimes
play<00:00:52.579> here<00:00:53.579> in<00:00:53.730> these<00:00:53.910> arms<00:00:54.270> can<00:00:54.360> cause<00:00:54.719> it

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
play here in these arms can cause it

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.900 
play here in these arms can cause it
over<00:00:56.850> here<00:00:57.289> with<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.469> pitman<00:00:58.829> arm<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.730> could

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
over here with the pitman arm that could

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.630 
over here with the pitman arm that could
cause<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.390> sometimes<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.960> steering<00:01:01.640> steering

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
cause it sometimes the steering steering

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.660 
cause it sometimes the steering steering
gears<00:01:02.850> can<00:01:03.149> do<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:04.129> so<00:01:05.129> we're<00:01:05.309> just<00:01:05.339> kind<00:01:05.640> of

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
gears can do it so we're just kind of

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.109 
gears can do it so we're just kind of
narrowing<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.300> down<00:01:06.330> with<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:07.160> options<00:01:08.160> with

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
narrowing it down with the options with

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.940 
narrowing it down with the options with
the<00:01:09.270> most<00:01:09.780> common<00:01:10.170> options<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.649> guess<00:01:10.679> you

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
the most common options I guess you

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.719 
the most common options I guess you
should<00:01:11.130> say<00:01:11.310> anyway<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.300> to<00:01:12.539> take<00:01:12.869> off<00:01:13.050> the

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
should say anyway so to take off the

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.100 
should say anyway so to take off the
steering<00:01:14.729> stabilizer<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:15.630> bolt<00:01:15.899> right<00:01:15.959> here

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
steering stabilizer this bolt right here

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.199 
steering stabilizer this bolt right here
is<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.789> fifteen<00:01:17.789> millimeter<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.649> the<00:01:19.649> one

00:01:20.199 --> 00:01:20.209 
is a fifteen millimeter and the one

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:23.359 
is a fifteen millimeter and the one
right<00:01:21.209> here<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.840> 19<00:01:22.440> millimeter<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:23.250> now<00:01:23.310> he

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
right here is a 19 millimeter and now he

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.880 
right here is a 19 millimeter and now he
took<00:01:23.610> out<00:01:23.789> the<00:01:23.940> cotter<00:01:24.149> pin<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:27.649> this<00:01:28.649> pull

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
took out the cotter pin so this pull

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.650 
took out the cotter pin so this pull
right<00:01:29.009> here<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.310> completely<00:01:29.819> stuck<00:01:30.119> on<00:01:30.479> the

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
right here is completely stuck on the

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.120 
right here is completely stuck on the
wrist<00:01:30.840> bar<00:01:32.599> right<00:01:33.599> here<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:34.440> only<00:01:34.649> place<00:01:34.920> with

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
wrist bar right here the only place with

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.339 
wrist bar right here the only place with
threads<00:01:35.550> so<00:01:36.090> it's<00:01:36.209> not<00:01:36.360> threaded<00:01:36.750> inside<00:01:37.200> of

00:01:37.339 --> 00:01:37.349 
threads so it's not threaded inside of

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:39.440 
threads so it's not threaded inside of
this<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:38.490> I'm<00:01:38.550> going<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.729> do<00:01:38.819> right<00:01:38.970> now<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.360> I'm

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
this so I'm going to do right now is I'm

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.880 
this so I'm going to do right now is I'm
going<00:01:39.539> to<00:01:39.599> take<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.810> torch<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.380> heat<00:01:40.440> it<00:01:40.679> up<00:01:40.770> a

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
going to take a torch and heat it up a

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.130 
going to take a torch and heat it up a
little<00:01:41.039> bit<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:42.000> w4t<00:01:42.630> wouldn't<00:01:42.869> do<00:01:42.959> anything

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
little bit the w4t wouldn't do anything

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.490 
little bit the w4t wouldn't do anything
to<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:44.569> one<00:01:45.569> more<00:01:45.750> reason<00:01:45.929> it<00:01:46.140> makes<00:01:46.319> me

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
to it one more reason it makes me

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.309 
to it one more reason it makes me
suspect<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:47.250> this<00:01:47.429> is<00:01:47.929> going<00:01:48.929> bad<00:01:49.110> up<00:01:49.289> here

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:49.319 
suspect that this is going bad up here

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:52.130 
suspect that this is going bad up here
is<00:01:49.709> that<00:01:50.130> it's<00:01:50.280> starting<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.940> leak<00:01:51.119> while<00:01:51.989> it's

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
is that it's starting to leak while it's

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.889 
is that it's starting to leak while it's
been<00:01:52.349> leaking<00:01:52.610> the<00:01:53.610> fluid<00:01:54.539> that's<00:01:54.720> been

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
been leaking the fluid that's been

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.889 
been leaking the fluid that's been
inside<00:01:55.170> of<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:56.000> so<00:01:57.000> once<00:01:57.209> that<00:01:57.300> happens<00:01:57.780> you

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
inside of it so once that happens you

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.219 
inside of it so once that happens you
know<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:59.280> shock<00:01:59.580> is<00:01:59.759> selfish<00:02:00.209> shot<00:02:00.509> so

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
know that the shock is selfish shot so

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.589 
know that the shock is selfish shot so
hopefully<00:02:02.009> anyone<00:02:02.520> who<00:02:02.610> fixed<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:02.940> death

00:02:03.589 --> 00:02:03.599 
hopefully anyone who fixed the death

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:06.790 
hopefully anyone who fixed the death
wobble

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.050 

okay<00:02:07.800> so<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.100> heat<00:02:08.280> was<00:02:08.429> pretty<00:02:08.670> much<00:02:08.789> useless

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
okay so the heat was pretty much useless

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.880 
okay so the heat was pretty much useless
so<00:02:09.750> what<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:09.899> have<00:02:10.080> right<00:02:10.289> now<00:02:10.320> are<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.710> tip

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
so what I have right now are the tip

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.630 
so what I have right now are the tip
Mountain<00:02:11.220> puller<00:02:12.470> so<00:02:13.470> I'm<00:02:13.560> going<00:02:13.740> to<00:02:13.770> do<00:02:14.010> is<00:02:14.490> I

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
Mountain puller so I'm going to do is I

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.090 
Mountain puller so I'm going to do is I
have<00:02:14.880> it<00:02:15.380> tightened<00:02:16.380> around<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.709> edges<00:02:17.070> of

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
have it tightened around the edges of

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.530 
have it tightened around the edges of
this<00:02:17.340> right<00:02:17.550> here<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:17.910> then<00:02:18.000> this<00:02:18.120> bolt<00:02:18.420> right

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
this right here and then this bolt right

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.750 
this right here and then this bolt right
here<00:02:18.860> pushes<00:02:19.860> against<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.430> one<00:02:20.640> and

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
here pushes against that one and

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.210 
here pushes against that one and
hopefully<00:02:20.910> we<00:02:21.180> can<00:02:21.209> get<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.770> bolt<00:02:22.770> out<00:02:23.040> of

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
hopefully we can get the bolt out of

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.940 
hopefully we can get the bolt out of
there<00:02:23.340> it's<00:02:23.490> bound<00:02:23.670> pretty<00:02:23.940> tight<00:02:24.890> anyway<00:02:25.890> so

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
there it's bound pretty tight anyway so

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.600 
there it's bound pretty tight anyway so
this<00:02:26.220> one<00:02:26.490> is<00:02:26.970> a<00:02:27.080> 17<00:02:28.080> millimeter<00:02:28.320> is<00:02:29.040> basically

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
this one is a 17 millimeter is basically

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.970 
this one is a 17 millimeter is basically
tighten<00:02:30.000> it<00:02:30.090> down<00:02:30.120> until<00:02:30.570> that<00:02:30.630> one<00:02:30.870> pops<00:02:31.110> off

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.250 

okay<00:02:35.330> so<00:02:36.330> that's<00:02:36.390> what<00:02:36.570> the<00:02:36.660> bowl<00:02:36.840> looks<00:02:37.050> like

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
okay so that's what the bowl looks like

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.750 
okay so that's what the bowl looks like
what<00:02:37.500> it's<00:02:37.620> tucked<00:02:37.830> down<00:02:37.950> in<00:02:38.010> there<00:02:38.280> like<00:02:38.459> I

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
what it's tucked down in there like I

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.160 
what it's tucked down in there like I
mentioned<00:02:39.060> before<00:02:39.330> it<00:02:39.420> doesn't<00:02:39.720> have<00:02:39.840> threads

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
mentioned before it doesn't have threads

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.449 
mentioned before it doesn't have threads
on<00:02:40.350> this<00:02:40.500> part<00:02:40.739> of<00:02:40.830> it<00:02:40.950> so<00:02:41.160> it<00:02:41.250> was<00:02:41.280> just

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
on this part of it so it was just

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.360 
on this part of it so it was just
basically<00:02:41.880> bound<00:02:42.209> inside<00:02:42.630> of<00:02:42.780> that<00:02:42.900> I<00:02:43.370> also

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
basically bound inside of that I also

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.520 
basically bound inside of that I also
forgot<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.730> mention<00:02:44.850> I<00:02:45.180> did<00:02:45.450> use<00:02:45.720> a<00:02:46.080> couple

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
forgot to mention I did use a couple

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.010 
forgot to mention I did use a couple
squirts<00:02:46.920> of<00:02:47.040> that<00:02:47.190> TV<00:02:47.370> blaster<00:02:47.970> stuff<00:02:48.270> stuff

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
squirts of that TV blaster stuff stuff

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.699 
squirts of that TV blaster stuff stuff
is<00:02:49.110> amazing

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
is amazing

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.610 
is amazing
I<00:02:50.000> was<00:02:51.000> using<00:02:51.209> w4t<00:02:51.840> before<00:02:52.140> that<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:52.530> I<00:02:52.560> don't

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
I was using w4t before that and I don't

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.810 
I was using w4t before that and I don't
know<00:02:52.770> if<00:02:52.890> it<00:02:52.980> was<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.190> Tippmann<00:02:53.400> arm<00:02:53.640> of<00:02:53.760> the

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
know if it was the Tippmann arm of the

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:00.290 
know if it was the Tippmann arm of the
PB<00:02:54.090> Blaster<00:02:54.570> but<00:02:54.780> hey<00:02:55.200> we<00:02:55.350> got<00:02:55.500> it<00:02:55.590> out<00:02:55.709> so<00:02:59.300> you

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
PB Blaster but hey we got it out so you

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.690 
PB Blaster but hey we got it out so you
can<00:03:00.450> see<00:03:00.480> where<00:03:00.780> it's<00:03:00.900> been<00:03:00.930> leaking<00:03:01.260> all<00:03:01.500> that

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
can see where it's been leaking all that

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.860 
can see where it's been leaking all that
hydraulic<00:03:02.700> fluid<00:03:03.180> or<00:03:03.269> whatever<00:03:03.480> else<00:03:03.720> they

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
hydraulic fluid or whatever else they

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.649 
hydraulic fluid or whatever else they
put<00:03:03.900> inside<00:03:04.350> these<00:03:04.560> things

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.899 

so<00:03:10.659> with<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:10.900> new<00:03:11.079> warm<00:03:11.379> I'm<00:03:11.760> pretty<00:03:12.760> much

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:12.909 
so with the new warm I'm pretty much

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:14.429 
so with the new warm I'm pretty much
just<00:03:12.969> plug-and-play<00:03:13.390> you<00:03:13.719> just<00:03:14.049> slide<00:03:14.260> it<00:03:14.379> in

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:14.439 
just plug-and-play you just slide it in

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:17.580 
just plug-and-play you just slide it in
there<00:03:14.500> and<00:03:15.000> then<00:03:16.000> I<00:03:16.359> believe<00:03:16.780> this<00:03:17.049> bolt<00:03:17.290> on

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
there and then I believe this bolt on

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.679 
there and then I believe this bolt on
this<00:03:17.799> end<00:03:18.010> is<00:03:18.099> a<00:03:18.189> 15<00:03:18.609> millimeter<00:03:18.939> then<00:03:19.510> the

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:19.689 
this end is a 15 millimeter then the

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:23.699 
this end is a 15 millimeter then the
other<00:03:19.810> one<00:03:20.049> is<00:03:20.379> an<00:03:20.560> 18<00:03:21.069> and<00:03:22.260> then<00:03:23.260> with<00:03:23.469> this

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
other one is an 18 and then with this

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.550 
other one is an 18 and then with this
end<00:03:24.069> right<00:03:24.189> here<00:03:24.760> I<00:03:25.049> went<00:03:26.049> ahead<00:03:26.109> and<00:03:26.319> put<00:03:26.470> the

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
end right here I went ahead and put the

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.360 
end right here I went ahead and put the
top<00:03:26.769> on<00:03:26.980> um<00:03:27.329> first<00:03:28.329> of<00:03:28.540> all<00:03:28.799> I'm<00:03:29.799> just<00:03:30.220> so<00:03:30.310> I

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
top on um first of all I'm just so I

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.410 
top on um first of all I'm just so I
wouldn't<00:03:30.519> have<00:03:30.640> to<00:03:30.700> deal<00:03:30.939> with<00:03:30.970> it<00:03:31.209> all<00:03:31.299> up

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
wouldn't have to deal with it all up

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.479 
wouldn't have to deal with it all up
inside<00:03:31.569> the<00:03:31.870> car<00:03:32.079> and<00:03:32.290> then<00:03:32.620> I<00:03:32.650> just<00:03:32.950> slid<00:03:33.250> this

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
inside the car and then I just slid this

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.940 
inside the car and then I just slid this
in<00:03:33.760> down<00:03:33.970> into<00:03:34.329> it<00:03:34.450> and<00:03:34.629> it's<00:03:35.260> pretty<00:03:35.470> easy<00:03:35.590> you

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
in down into it and it's pretty easy you

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.309 
in down into it and it's pretty easy you
know<00:03:36.400> it's<00:03:36.549> all<00:03:36.810> now<00:03:37.810> that<00:03:37.959> I<00:03:37.989> got<00:03:38.139> the<00:03:38.200> other

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
know it's all now that I got the other

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:39.959 
know it's all now that I got the other
bolt<00:03:38.560> out<00:03:38.709> this<00:03:38.980> one<00:03:39.129> just<00:03:39.340> slides<00:03:39.579> in<00:03:39.760> and<00:03:39.879> out

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:39.969 
bolt out this one just slides in and out

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:43.649 
bolt out this one just slides in and out
pretty<00:03:40.870> simply<00:03:41.519> so<00:03:42.519> and<00:03:43.030> then<00:03:43.150> I<00:03:43.269> just<00:03:43.389> need<00:03:43.569> to

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:43.659 
pretty simply so and then I just need to

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:48.270 
pretty simply so and then I just need to
put<00:03:43.870> the<00:03:44.970> bolt<00:03:45.970> on<00:03:46.209> this<00:03:46.450> in<00:03:46.889> with<00:03:47.889> the<00:03:47.919> cotter

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
put the bolt on this in with the cotter

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.970 
put the bolt on this in with the cotter
pin<00:03:48.609> and<00:03:48.819> you<00:03:49.060> see<00:03:49.269> the<00:03:49.359> bowl<00:03:49.569> has<00:03:49.810> the<00:03:49.980> little

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
pin and you see the bowl has the little

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.649 
pin and you see the bowl has the little
ridges<00:03:51.280> on<00:03:51.519> it's<00:03:51.669> the<00:03:51.819> cotter<00:03:52.060> pin<00:03:52.239> can<00:03:52.419> slide

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:52.659 
ridges on it's the cotter pin can slide

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:59.069 
ridges on it's the cotter pin can slide
inside<00:03:53.019> bolt<00:03:53.919> just<00:03:54.010> goes<00:03:54.340> on<00:03:54.489> like<00:03:54.700> that<00:03:58.079> there

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
inside bolt just goes on like that there

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.349 
inside bolt just goes on like that there
you<00:03:59.290> believe<00:04:00.250> that<00:04:00.519> this<00:04:00.669> nut<00:04:00.970> needs<00:04:01.120> to<00:04:01.269> be

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
you believe that this nut needs to be

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.839 
you believe that this nut needs to be
tightened<00:04:01.540> to<00:04:01.689> 35<00:04:02.250> pounds<00:04:03.250> of<00:04:03.489> torque<00:04:03.639> and

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
tightened to 35 pounds of torque and

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:06.599 
tightened to 35 pounds of torque and
then<00:04:03.939> the<00:04:04.060> top<00:04:04.239> one<00:04:04.419> as<00:04:04.569> well<00:04:05.189> so<00:04:06.189> that's<00:04:06.400> how

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
then the top one as well so that's how

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:10.610 
then the top one as well so that's how
you<00:04:06.669> install<00:04:07.859> steering<00:04:08.859> stabilizer<00:04:09.099> I

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
you install steering stabilizer I

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.349 
you install steering stabilizer I
