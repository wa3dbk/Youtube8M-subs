and then there's three different areas
you're<00:00:56.940> going<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.120> be<00:00:57.180> throwing<00:00:57.420> ten<00:00:57.960> to

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
you're going to be throwing ten to

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.889 
you're going to be throwing ten to
twenty<00:00:58.500> twenty<00:00:59.489> plus<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:00.090> over<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.420> top<00:01:00.480> and

twenty twenty plus and over the top and

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.869 
twenty twenty plus and over the top and
the<00:01:01.649> technique<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.190> just<00:01:02.430> going<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.670> vary

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
the technique is just going to vary

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.710 
the technique is just going to vary
slightly<00:01:03.120> with<00:01:04.080> each<00:01:04.260> one<00:01:05.119> so<00:01:06.119> for<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.390> 10<00:01:06.600> to

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
slightly with each one so for the 10 to

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.270 
slightly with each one so for the 10 to
20<00:01:07.020> yard<00:01:07.200> range<00:01:07.380> what<00:01:07.619> we're<00:01:07.740> going<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.950> do<00:01:08.040> is

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
20 yard range what we're going to do is

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.190 
20 yard range what we're going to do is
we're<00:01:08.880> going<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.030> precision<00:01:09.360> down<00:01:09.720> into<00:01:10.110> the

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
we're going to precision down into the

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.960 
we're going to precision down into the
outside<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:11.159> on<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.369> left<00:01:11.549> side<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.820> field

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
outside so on the left side of the field

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.670 
outside so on the left side of the field
you're<00:01:12.150> going<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.420> throw<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.689> bullet<00:01:13.049> pass<00:01:13.229> down

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
you're going to throw a bullet pass down

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.350 
you're going to throw a bullet pass down

and left and then you're going to take

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.179 
and left and then you're going to take
control<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.869> wide<00:01:16.110> receiver<00:01:16.590> as<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.830> can<00:01:17.009> see

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
when you want to throw the ball is when

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.499 
when you want to throw the ball is when
the<00:01:37.920> defender<00:01:38.340> turns<00:01:38.579> its<00:01:38.790> back<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:39.180> because

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
the defender turns its back to because

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.480 
the defender turns its back to because

if it hasn't turned his back there's a

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.920 
if it hasn't turned his back there's a
good<00:01:41.670> chance<00:01:41.909> it's<00:01:42.150> going<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.390> get<00:01:42.509> picked<00:01:42.720> off

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
good chance it's going to get picked off

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.380 
good chance it's going to get picked off
for<00:01:43.259> swatting<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.640> have<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:45.000> watch<00:01:45.149> the

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
for swatting so you have to watch the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.240 
for swatting so you have to watch the
defender<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.020> only<00:01:46.409> throw<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.770> if<00:01:46.920> they<00:01:47.070> have

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
defender and only throw it if they have

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.160 
defender and only throw it if they have
their<00:01:47.430> back<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.850> your<00:01:48.090> wide<00:01:48.270> receiver<00:01:48.630> and

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
their back to your wide receiver and

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.620 
their back to your wide receiver and
this<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.470> in<00:01:49.590> all<00:01:49.829> cases<00:01:50.100> with<00:01:51.030> all<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.420> face

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
this is in all cases with all the face

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.550 
this is in all cases with all the face
drums<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:53.479> it's<00:01:54.479> best<00:01:54.750> against<00:01:55.020> one-on-one

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560

drums and it's best against one-on-one
coverage<00:01:55.799> but<00:01:56.130> sometimes<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.729> can<00:01:56.909> get<00:01:57.030> our

coverage but sometimes you can get our

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.940 
plus yardarm faced off the only
difference<00:02:03.240> between<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.350> 10<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.649> 20

difference between this and the 10 to 20

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.580 
difference between this and the 10 to 20
is<00:02:05.070> you're<00:02:05.189> going<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.369> want<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.579> precision<00:02:05.969> up

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
is you're going to want to precision up

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.749 
is you're going to want to precision up
you<00:02:07.590> know<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.740> lot<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:08.009> guys<00:02:08.220> don't<00:02:08.459> know<00:02:08.610> the

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
you know a lot of guys don't know the

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.729 
you know a lot of guys don't know the
difference<00:02:08.910> but<00:02:09.450> if<00:02:09.959> you<00:02:10.080> precision<00:02:10.560> down

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
difference but if you precision down

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.619 
difference but if you precision down
into<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.160> outside<00:02:11.550> on<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.060> deeper<00:02:12.420> one

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
into the outside on the deeper one

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.920 
into the outside on the deeper one
there's<00:02:12.930> a<00:02:12.989> good<00:02:13.140> chance<00:02:13.379> that<00:02:13.560> it<00:02:13.650> gets

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
there's a good chance that it gets

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.050 
there's a good chance that it gets
Walker<00:02:14.049> picked<00:02:14.500> off<00:02:14.680> so<00:02:15.579> when<00:02:15.939> you're

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
Walker picked off so when you're

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.569 
Walker picked off so when you're
throwing<00:02:16.239> the<00:02:16.480> 20-plus<00:02:16.930> yard<00:02:17.319> one<00:02:17.560> you<00:02:18.459> know

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:18.579 
throwing the 20-plus yard one you know

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.179 
throwing the 20-plus yard one you know
you<00:02:18.640> make<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.209> precision<00:02:19.810> pass<00:02:20.349> up<00:02:20.680> bullet

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:21.189 
you make the precision pass up bullet

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.970 
you make the precision pass up bullet
pass<00:02:21.659> again<00:02:22.659> the<00:02:22.840> same<00:02:23.079> concept<00:02:23.650> throat<00:02:23.829> when

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
pass again the same concept throat when

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.490 
pass again the same concept throat when
the<00:02:24.069> defender<00:02:24.459> turns<00:02:24.700> is<00:02:24.849> back<00:02:25.109> cut<00:02:26.109> in<00:02:26.290> cut

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
the defender turns is back cut in cut

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.789 
the defender turns is back cut in cut
out<00:02:26.709> and<00:02:26.980> make<00:02:27.459> the<00:02:27.609> catch<00:02:27.989> now<00:02:28.989> over<00:02:29.439> the<00:02:29.469> top

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
out and make the catch now over the top

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.330 
out and make the catch now over the top
is<00:02:30.719> just<00:02:31.719> a<00:02:31.840> little<00:02:31.989> bit<00:02:32.170> different<00:02:32.590> it's<00:02:33.250> a

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
is just a little bit different it's a

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.250 
is just a little bit different it's a
lot<00:02:33.489> easier<00:02:33.519> all<00:02:34.269> you<00:02:34.540> have<00:02:34.659> to<00:02:34.750> do<00:02:34.870> is<00:02:35.019> throw<00:02:35.170> a

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
lot easier all you have to do is throw a

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.149 
lot easier all you have to do is throw a
precision<00:02:35.859> pass<00:02:36.069> up<00:02:36.689> bullet<00:02:37.689> pass<00:02:37.900> it<00:02:38.230> and<00:02:38.439> you

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:39.159 
precision pass up bullet pass it and you

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.530 
precision pass up bullet pass it and you
know<00:02:39.189> again<00:02:39.519> throw<00:02:39.819> it<00:02:39.909> when<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.120> defender

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
know again throw it when the defender

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.330 
know again throw it when the defender
turns<00:02:40.750> their<00:02:40.989> back<00:02:41.019> or<00:02:41.439> once<00:02:41.859> you're<00:02:42.010> on<00:02:42.040> top

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
turns their back or once you're on top

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.360 
turns their back or once you're on top
of<00:02:42.489> the<00:02:42.549> defender<00:02:43.000> and<00:02:43.560> you<00:02:44.560> know<00:02:44.709> you<00:02:44.980> don't

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
of the defender and you know you don't

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.069 
of the defender and you know you don't
have<00:02:45.489> to<00:02:45.700> cut<00:02:45.909> in<00:02:46.060> all<00:02:46.359> you<00:02:46.659> have<00:02:46.750> to<00:02:46.840> do<00:02:46.959> is

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
have to cut in all you have to do is

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:49.319 
have to cut in all you have to do is
take<00:02:47.230> control<00:02:47.500> of<00:02:47.620> wide<00:02:47.889> receiver<00:02:48.250> and<00:02:48.609> hold

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
take control of wide receiver and hold

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:50.699 
take control of wide receiver and hold
the<00:02:49.450> catch<00:02:49.629> button<00:02:50.019> and<00:02:50.169> you'll<00:02:50.260> get<00:02:50.470> a<00:02:50.500> nice

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
the catch button and you'll get a nice

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.170 
the catch button and you'll get a nice
little<00:02:50.919> animation<00:02:51.459> as<00:02:51.579> you<00:02:51.700> see<00:02:51.909> in<00:02:51.970> their

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
little animation as you see in their

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.420 
little animation as you see in their
face<00:02:53.169> throwing<00:02:53.470> can<00:02:53.650> really<00:02:54.069> take<00:02:54.280> your

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
face throwing can really take your

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.909 
face throwing can really take your
offense<00:02:54.819> to<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.090> next<00:02:55.359> level<00:02:55.750> and<00:02:55.900> allow<00:02:56.859> you

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:56.919 
offense to the next level and allow you

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:59.670 
offense to the next level and allow you
to<00:02:57.159> take<00:02:57.310> advantage<00:02:57.819> of<00:02:57.939> mismatches<00:02:58.389> or<00:02:58.900> you

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
to take advantage of mismatches or you

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.020 
to take advantage of mismatches or you
know<00:02:59.709> take<00:03:00.040> advantage<00:03:00.430> of<00:03:00.519> a<00:03:00.639> big<00:03:00.819> wide

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
know take advantage of a big wide

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.020 
know take advantage of a big wide
receiver<00:03:01.419> that<00:03:01.629> you<00:03:01.750> have<00:03:02.129> you<00:03:03.129> know<00:03:03.280> again

receiver that you have you know again

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.879 
receiver that you have you know again
height<00:03:04.450> is<00:03:04.689> really<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.349> only<00:03:05.439> thing<00:03:05.709> that

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:05.889 
height is really the only thing that
