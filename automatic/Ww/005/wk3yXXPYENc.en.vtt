at<00:00:16.890> this<00:00:17.010> point<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:17.820> feel<00:00:18.630> like<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:20.029> was<00:00:21.029> always

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
at this point I feel like I was always

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.550 
at this point I feel like I was always
once<00:00:21.600> told<00:00:21.810> that<00:00:22.080> if<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:23.330> if<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.720> if<00:00:25.019> you<00:00:25.289> feel

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
once told that if you if you if you feel

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.040

think<00:00:28.260> there's<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.529> theory<00:00:28.859> that<00:00:29.010> goes<00:00:29.279> with

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
think there's a theory that goes with

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.189 
think there's a theory that goes with
that<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:30.000> know<00:00:30.119> when<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.390> body<00:00:30.599> fat<00:00:30.929> gets

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
that you know when the body fat gets

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.729 
that you know when the body fat gets

either<00:02:50.360> so<00:02:50.810> I<00:02:51.200> feel<00:02:52.190> like<00:02:52.340> I've<00:02:52.459> helped<00:02:52.760> save

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
either so I feel like I've helped save

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.260 
either so I feel like I've helped save
my<00:02:53.360> joints<00:02:53.930> also<00:02:54.800> saved<00:02:55.280> my<00:02:55.459> bank<00:02:55.700> account<00:02:56.060> and

those<00:02:56.390> should<00:02:56.600> go<00:02:56.630> behind<00:02:56.900> me<00:02:57.200> as<00:02:57.380> much<00:02:57.590> as

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
those should go behind me as much as

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.449 
those should go behind me as much as
well<00:02:58.300> you<00:02:59.300> know<00:02:59.420> eight<00:03:00.170> days<00:03:00.470> out<00:03:00.680> now<00:03:01.010> so

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
well you know eight days out now so

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.360 
well you know eight days out now so
every<00:03:01.850> single<00:03:02.240> day<00:03:02.450> things<00:03:03.260> get<00:03:03.650> watched<00:03:03.980> very

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
every single day things get watched very

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.540 
every single day things get watched very
closely<00:03:04.610> I<00:03:05.120> don't<00:03:05.450> I<00:03:06.140> don't<00:03:06.920> bother<00:03:07.160> to<00:03:07.430> my

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
closely I don't I don't bother to my

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.460 
closely I don't I don't bother to my
sodium<00:03:08.000> yet<00:03:08.269> we<00:03:08.600> don't<00:03:08.720> even<00:03:09.050> I<00:03:09.260> don't<00:03:09.290> even

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
sodium yet we don't even I don't even

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.610 
sodium yet we don't even I don't even
play<00:03:09.739> them<00:03:10.010> so<00:03:10.300> the<00:03:11.300> sodium<00:03:11.690> will<00:03:12.019> stay<00:03:12.260> in

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
play them so the sodium will stay in

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.360 
play them so the sodium will stay in
most<00:03:13.280> likely<00:03:14.090> all<00:03:14.390> the<00:03:14.630> bacons<00:03:15.019> show<00:03:15.290> if<00:03:16.160> I'll

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
most likely all the bacons show if I'll

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.949 
most likely all the bacons show if I'll
play<00:03:16.580> with<00:03:16.790> it<00:03:16.970> and<00:03:17.060> if<00:03:17.120> I<00:03:17.239> need<00:03:17.420> to<00:03:17.570> play<00:03:17.750> with

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
play with it and if I need to play with

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.520 
play with it and if I need to play with
it<00:03:18.170> then<00:03:19.100> that'll<00:03:19.489> be<00:03:19.519> Thursday<00:03:20.209> evening<00:03:20.989> /

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
stone even I feel like when you cut so

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.190 
stone even I feel like when you cut so
even<00:03:27.470> you're<00:03:27.560> gonna<00:03:27.680> flatten<00:03:28.010> out<00:03:28.310> that's<00:03:29.209> you

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200
