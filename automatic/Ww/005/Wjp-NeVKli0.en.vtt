00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 be careful as I am a fox 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.330
 first I do things and then check if 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.620
 they are right 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.670
 so I played this game 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.700
 convinced that it was kalos dexter 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.400
 say kalos but this is not so 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.350
 it is not a struggle in bgc but one 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.000
 normal double fight so not 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.020
 watch what the comment says 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.180
 following which he registered 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.550
 previously therefore before 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.240
 check if toghe tic actually 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.040
 belonged to the kalos desk and nothing 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.540
 I'm sorry for this mistake enjoy it 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.700
 like a double fight 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.559
 hi everyone here super lupine 777 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.809
 welcome to this new side wi fi sui 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.690
 pokémon xy this time we are against 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.059
 carolina and as you can see this is the first one 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.340
 attempt because of this it is 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.050
 at the end of the struggle in pdc then we give 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.200
 immediately the purple fight and I will tell you all 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.200
 what's this 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.489
 then the challenge with carolina starts 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.930
 then why this is an attempt to 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.530
 fight by bike because my team 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.229
 made tiziano for toc tic is not made 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.240
 for the vco however the double fight is 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.190
 made simply for the fight in 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.380
 single but a nice one came up 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.990
 game and I wanted to let you see the 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.659
 my robes probably loser or indeed 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.060
 long because it is the only pokémon that for 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:26.750
 now or to fight in this 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.759
 in this way it is nothing starts immediately with 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.190
 here I am my little toghe tic per 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.920
 attract all the attacks of mine 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.750
 opponents while with but nec mega trick e 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.700
 volvo to bring down the attack of this 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.799
 it was cross and to shoot him a nice one 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.569
 flamethrower with special attack 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.280
 increased that never hurts 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:44.899
 an attraction comes from that garda award 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.740
 probably addressed to my ma nec 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.110
 click 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.940
 but my togas take it this way 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.830
 will compromise the game a little look 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.360
 what a ridiculous damage he makes a mega horn 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.250
 uncorked by hera cost 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.470
 probably it was the attack because it wasn't 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.909
 I know how it could have been done but cross but 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.829
 I don't think it can be so much zoe 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.979
 however, I go for a shameful time 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:06.289
 because I couldn't protect mine 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.600
 magnetic this turn with my robes 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:09.739
 so decided to change and send the 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.230
 my hedges tubs could hold up 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.030
 very well some of that attacks 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.040
 guard and guarin being him very much 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.989
 defensive instead this looks and looks at 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.549
 surprise for a healthy wave on his era 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.890
 kroos but leaves the field of 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:25.040
 battle before this looks and heals 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.320
 could target his luca attack 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.329
 yo and turns out to be the mega evolution 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.829
 of my opponent then a mega 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:33.260
 local on the field goes for giufà 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:35.600
 probably a click in suzhou ago 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.090
 for scam on the new age and slash e 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.670
 so the attack naturally does not go to 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.920
 sign because it has no effect on him on 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.840
 my little eg slash does for sword dancing 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.519
 and then my toc tic in 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.319
 is in love but manages to stick with 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.599
 toxin this guard and now unfortunately 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.760
 this is a mistake on my part because me 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.709
 I was forgotten that his card is healing 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.810
 it had no trace but synchronism 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.910
 so I was foolish to go 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.680
 for the toxin but does nothing because it toc 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.560
 tic only serves me to protect the 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.060
 others not so much to protect themselves 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.830
 that is, if he dies, he does nothing 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.150
 the important thing that averages a few turns of 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.310
 advantage over others using 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.870
 I'm here and unfortunately falling in love 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.569
 this time it prevents me from using son 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.099
 here so I can't protect the 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.780
 my and isla attack of those from 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:21.790
 Attack hardware that should arrive 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.910
 now it should be a shadow ball though 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.739
 I'm not mistaken in fact here it comes 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.329
 anyway my toc tic if you weren't 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.849
 still understood with the condensed volleys 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:33.790
 because it has really absurd defenses 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:35.140
 ie defense is defended special arrives at 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.879
 absurd levels look how many 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.760
 attacks has already resisted this little one 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:41.920
 so a chick stockings can withstand 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.170
 and attacks of all also in the 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.329
 evolution also printed do not care 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.549
 nothing he resists everything however gees 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.930
 leaves as can be easily understood 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.600
 to wipe out this air look with 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.489
 Solemn sword because the solemn sword 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.260
 because naturally being more 2 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.340
 attack could not do 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.200
 anything 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.910
 take away that loses more and more life but 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.010
 I don't want to replace it to make them 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.540
 lose them falling in love because it's more 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.280
 useful in the field that decides to 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.280
 go for a are here and this time 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.840
 luckily it goes to sign because with images 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.750
 leaving me I am protected but I am 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.519
 gone for a shadow to claw socialize 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.760
 to try to get over it and who 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:20.049
 look at you flame thrower says richard 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.579
 uncorked does not make me a dick 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.770
 unfortunately the psychic is 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.590
 sufficient garda vr is sufficient to 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.330
 send me ko but i had 32 of life it would be 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.370
 been ridiculous and resist an attack 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.870
 of the genus shadow claws manages to 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.820
 wipe out this already richard between 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.770
 the other bad blow but it doesn't matter 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.300
 because unless he had the fire a 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.660
 this is the tape there would be 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.610
 was destined to leave ko for each 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.099
 shadow claws also very normal I think 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.120
 even with minimal damage ie he didn't think 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:47.470
 could resist 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.050
 my ma nec trick comes into play 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.300
 just to give him a little bit of give 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.789
 more before finishing it with my hedges 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.300
 las decided to defend me so much for 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:57.620
 sport trees so much 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.810
 and not from my side who would have it 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.610
 brought down while with man ektrica I go 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.860
 for invert volts because it just doesn't 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.539
 I want to lose the only two that can 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.539
 then wipe out this guard award 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:11.240
 use invert volt and go into my try 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:13.159
 bloody he who has been exchanged is 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.129
 really very beautiful and among other things shiny 

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:18.409
 look a little and I have wanted it for a long time 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:21.349
 have a test that spared me the 

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:22.970
 breathing this exchange and no cards 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:24.680
 unfortunately web addresses unfortunately 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.629
 for him directs below towards the made 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.639
 slash and the poison is sufficient to 

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:32.569
 send ko this garda so there is also 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:34.580
 a kilpper toc tic here I don't know who it is 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:36.289
 the worst pokémon that is naturally is 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.770
 state try crew and stretch in the field 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:41.449
 and ended up fighting but did not 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.949
 even sense to say who the was the 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:44.900
 pokémon worse because in the end a 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:46.310
 this was only as I said one 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.110
 try to see if they can 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.750
 to deal with such struggles 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.819
 maybe since they are very short, that is 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.280
 if they were to be so brief it 

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:57.289
 I do two on video I don't know how you prefer 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.389
 however it was only to launch 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:01.430
 the idea and then let me know you 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:03.080
 anyway if you liked it exactly 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.759
 the invitation as always to leave a beautiful 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.810
 I like it and we'll see each other 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:07.810
 video bye bye
