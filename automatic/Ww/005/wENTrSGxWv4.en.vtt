00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:12.660
 hello is to read quail with this 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.179
 video I'm going to introduce you to a toy from 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.010
 at mega bloks which is the pursuit of 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.630
 Bahrain so this game box that 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.570
 contains 120 firefighters that's who is 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.150
 for children over 8 years old 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.279
 first contains a manual that will 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.740
 explain yourself in great detail 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.560
 how you will be able 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.630
 build the different elements of the 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.800
 toy so the first thing I have 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.120
 want to tell you about that 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.730
 is that if you intend to offer the 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.129
 play box to a child who has about 8 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.130
 in May to be still near the 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.620
 purpose when you go 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.150
 offered him because at the level of 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.760
 assembly I'm not sure they 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.250
 arrive alone then me in 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.140
 I have started by opening 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.740
 sachets that contained both 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:01.880
 characters to know the elf warrior of 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:03.920
 the night and lorque warrior then all 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.560
 both actually are delivered 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.120
 completely assembled and therefore even if 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.950
 for you can the structures and 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.520
 as you want so much at the level of 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.900
 arms and people but that's head 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:20.390
 you have nothing to do but to 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:24.650
 clip here this little piece for 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:27.950
 able to fix the play his weapon in his 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:31.190
 back so here's the finish is pretty 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.820
 pretty but my the pieces are not 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.259
 very large 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.259
 as you can see in relation to 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:39.140
 the dimension of manas so that's 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:45.590
 the student of the night and the lorque warlock 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:55.880
 is here then he comes with a 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:59.300
 stick that see as rather so him 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:05.899
 as well be the little clip you 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:06.890
 can fix it in his back then as 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.020
 I told you they are completely 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.399
 articulated so you can really their 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.510
 do just about anything you do 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.010
 do you want they do not come very well to 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.440
 6.20 there I get there from the first caused a 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:22.100
 shot of room but in general I 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.890
 does not happen very well so that's what 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.350
 about the characters then I 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.690
 opened the bag that contained the tiger 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:33.110
 this night haven and he is also 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.540
 deliver completely goes up so he's 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:39.709
 made of soft plastic and the finish is 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.720
 really pretty pretty unlike the 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:45.680
 first video I made on the 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.050
 agile griffin I did not really notice 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.459
 worries about the flows of 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.950
 colors 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.110
 so frankly it's a beautiful object the 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.840
 Saddle saddle only item you need 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:00.660
 fix by yourself 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:04.890
 and she is holding this time on the 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:08.040
 title then I started assembling 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.480
 with the flags the one destined for the 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.050
 horde and the alliance wants it's very 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.450
 simple you just have a base the stick 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.420
 and the flags so no difficulty in 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.250
 that level when it comes to the rocket 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.080
 it's a little longer and I 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.600
 would say that in total you have to count 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.370
 about 30 minutes to have gathered 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.290
 all the objects so that gives you a 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.910
 idea before opening the box if you 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.980
 just have a little time in front of you 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.350
 count anyway half an hour for 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.210
 not feeling too hurried so you 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.150
 start by actually building the 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:42.090
 central structure of the rocket then 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.850
 you build the back of this 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:48.060
 vounet rocket then placed the front and 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.650
 the seats from above so me my 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.540
 first feeling about this 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.110
 rocket is she is really very 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.880
 solid 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.000
 the way the pieces are 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.520
 assemblies really gives a beautiful 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.560
 structure to toys and that's really 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.430
 without any apprehension that I want 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.530
 to play with 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.290
 I 'm going to have no feeling 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.630
 that I'm going to ruin it and dismount it at 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.960
 every time I'm going to manipulate it here 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:16.470
 you have a clip system 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:18.660
 that's really pivoting 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.239
 the back of the rocket and you can 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.090
 to give it to your heart's content frankly 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:27.390
 there is no problem at the level of 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:31.830
 fragility the object the seats are 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:33.660
 completely orientable and so you 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:38.490
 can come here to place your 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:41.760
 characters especially thanks to the small 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:44.430
 round that you have here so there you 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.070
 rest going limping and they traffic 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:50.250
 it's on the seat 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.000
 so what I remember about myself 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.910
 his toys 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.640
 so that's really the strength of the 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.950
 rocket is the editing time that is 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:02.160
 about 30 minutes is really a 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:05.460
 nice finish at the level of this game so 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.560
 you also have in the box there 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.020
 little map that gives you access to a 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:13.229
 key to test the game for free 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.789
 up to the 20th level so for those who 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:16.800
 do not know world of 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:18.300
 warcraft is a beautiful way of you 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.389
 initiate even though I think you are 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:24.740
 few you also have 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:27.949
 some extra pieces 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:32.849
 So here is my after mounting 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:34.800
 this is what I have left as a piece that 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:38.070
 I did not use 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:41.430
 so I wish you a good fun 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:43.560
 with this game and I will not miss in 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:47.310
 the days that come to present you 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:50.090
 a brand new toy from mega bloks 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.090
 see you soon
