creepers we're not reversed but like a
rare<00:06:57.350> lightning<00:06:57.860> energy<00:06:58.190> that's<00:06:58.970> very<00:06:59.090> cool

00:06:59.470 --> 00:06:59.480 
rare lightning energy that's very cool

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.450 
rare lightning energy that's very cool
indeed<00:06:59.800> so<00:07:00.800> they're<00:07:00.920> doing<00:07:01.010> pretty<00:07:01.130> good<00:07:01.340> with

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:01.460 
indeed so they're doing pretty good with

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.400 
indeed so they're doing pretty good with
these<00:07:01.520> energies<00:07:01.880> and<00:07:02.060> I<00:07:02.120> rare<00:07:02.330> is<00:07:02.540> a<00:07:02.570> torkoal

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:03.410 
these energies and I rare is a torkoal

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.130 
these energies and I rare is a torkoal
