00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.160
 hello welcome to my 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:14.480
 There is a whole world today 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.460
 nice video I think it works now 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.470
 only 34 minutes because I want one 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.480
 make smoothie and continue to do so 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.070
 short time in Hamburg at the fair and 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.439
 I have a lot of music every day 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.329
 made i think i have a total of 25 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.029
 kilo of fruits and vegetables consumed and we 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:30.200
 have about ten times as much every day 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.820
 always made another one 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.379
 and I thought so now because many 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.850
 Asked what was in there 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:37.190
 I'll just show you this in 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.070
 short videos so I'll do one now 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.079
 Green smoothie and that is how it is 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.180
 Above all, it's better if you start 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.610
 one at green smoothies in the two-piece 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.920
 green and three parts of fruit thus decreases 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.630
 smoothie also tastes like hardcore 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.070
 People just stop by green smoothies 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.620
 really only green vegetables that is 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.899
 of course very healthy and rich in vitamins 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.579
 that in many minerals but in there 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.230
 at the beginning it does not taste good 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.300
 really if you just make spinach small 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.119
 So far cucumber is there for that is why 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.110
 us until the middle of august and you 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.030
 have to get used to it 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.790
 you have to get used to know exactly 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.990
 you as us in the beginning too many smoothies 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.120
 drink because you have to really on very 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.890
 toilet so who has digestive problems 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.200
 and constipation should be easy 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.770
 smoothies or you have to go for it 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.020
 accustom 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.450
 exactly do I say this just once briefly 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.220
 ingredients for you so I have here 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.630
 such a very small piece ginger me 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.790
 always take something for me personally 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.200
 more i like this spicy here i have 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.540
 a half pineapple the hall already 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.580
 peeled banana could also be one 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.450
 handful grapes and a little bit 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.399
 spinach 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.799
 already washed and it is all right 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:42.710
 easy at first I must go to the ginger 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.390
 Peel and not complete the 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.670
 peel off but you just rub it 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.490
 sky knife goes down a bit 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.439
 on the spoon for example then have 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.750
 you do not have so much ownership 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.039
 otherwise they can also make it 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.020
 but that sometimes works too 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.479
 stop with in it I like to take 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.700
 There is now in the mixer and there 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.130
 I already have about 400 milliliters 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.299
 water in there because we are very important 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.429
 Do you want to drink? 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.549
 therefore, the liquid must be pure 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.360
 and because of the inga these strong 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:14.620
 Of course, fiber structures must first 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.620
 be made small someday 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.630
 and if you have the country as far as 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.310
 you can always run the mixa 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.930
 I think you do not understand so wild 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.930
 is and so on is still the mirror 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.720
 if it is nice and fresh we will go 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.920
 the grapes in with 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.430
 I keep turning it on 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.430
 highest level 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.030
 to scream and banana 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.350
 and now it must have also 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.550
 finished so within three minutes 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.160
 and we'll do that by the way 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.910
 meanwhile every day because I feel 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.280
 me active 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:05.820
 that must really say I always have it 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:08.230
 later they would be funny 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.420
 I know that tastes like everyone else 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.010
 tomorrow so you can do it yourself 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.560
 do what you want to do, than I think 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.830
 cucumber marcel egger the grapes bananas 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.220
 and the pineapple has the sweet and 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:22.330
 I am very good classic 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.770
 and if you like it in the morning, for example 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.200
 a big helping can do that 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.490
 also bottled and easy 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.810
 the day about drinking in the fridge 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.370
 Of course , always save before 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.380
 shake your head again because otherwise 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.580
 just settle the ingredients again 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.620
 because there are no preservatives 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.300
 There are no emulsifiers in it 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.070
 that is why it is quite natural that 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.170
 I'll settle moisture sometime and 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.240
 so on certain vegetables above 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.100
 floats tastes like I I 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.240
 interrupted 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.660
 You already have me three times today 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.540
 called I do not say any more 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:54.070
 Great and now I wish you all 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.030
 Have fun imitating and we see 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.620

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.540
 and if you want me several like that 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.460
