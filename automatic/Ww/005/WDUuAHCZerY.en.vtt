00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.910
 hello youtube friends in the video 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:12.770
 today and to continue with this series of 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.709
 repair of breakdown the washing machine 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:18.230
 automatic let's see a case that 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:22.279
 we have here that it is a door 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:25.429
 of the inner drum let's say jammed or 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:28.939
 be that you can not access to take the 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:31.249
 clothes or open it all in this kind of 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.980
 breakdowns can be found here in 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:37.010
 this list that I'm leaving here there 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.990
 they will find all kinds of breakdowns that 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.150
 I'm going to go up and once 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:44.000
 find the ones you need 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.010
 you to solve before moving on to 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.050
 the solution to this problem I will read 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.760
 a greeting corresponding to people 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.610
 who have commented first on videos 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.910
 earlier and they are jesus brown 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.890
 blacksmith and his daughter scheme of alicante 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.750
 Spain 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.210
 for it go a huge greeting of meat 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.189
 of little angel and my own 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.860
 This is the top loading washing machine 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:10.430
 who had mentioned them and let's see 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.040
 how the drum is locked for it 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.040
 let's take out the right side seen 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.510
 I brought them the screws 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.510
 three screws that he has here behind 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.690
 and we uncover the pulley of the 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.680
 washing machine 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:37.090
 here we will not find you rent 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:39.220
 do not turn the cover the same summer and 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.400
 here that is impossible to move because the 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.080
 stage they have opened below this 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.650
 it happens because in the drum covers 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:51.160
 They are goofing off their cut and stay 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.880
 more saved the following happens when the 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:02:00.240
 drum rotates 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:02.579
 in this way the mud layer and there in 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.490
 that part I found the drum we have the 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:08.670
 heating resistance 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.959
 what happens very close to the drum then 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:15.000
 the stage then prevents the drum from turning 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.959
 because it opens and opens sometimes to both 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.500
 sides of the resistance in this way 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.360
 advantage 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.760
 bend for one side and for the other 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.830
 neither here at the bottom of the 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.580
 drum that would stay up when 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:32.130
 it's locked we're going to have a lid 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.160
 What is a ship that engages clothing and 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.410
 you turn in that by going down a 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.930
 latch here you can run and you 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.360
 release leaving the hole will be ready 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.090
 us what we have to deal with is 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.100
 lift this to allow the drum 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.260
 turn to that side because if you do not 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.300
 we raise is going to put the resistance 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.070
 in the middle this is simulated here what 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.560
 we have to do is with a wire 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:03:00.700
 long put it from the hole 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:05.610
 and hook the lid in that way doing 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.610
 spin the drum will happen 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.210
 and we can now turn it all to 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.820
 that the final stage up 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.260
 this is the explanation we went to do it 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:21.790
 here in the washing machine in question 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:24.610
 we tighten a lock that has and we run 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.470
 releasing the hole of course 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.510
 this always happens because the washing machine 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.540
 has already been launched and has clothes 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.330
 therefore in order to get the 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.210
 wire and open you have to take first the 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.310
 clothes that you have inside so we're going to 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.840
 proceed to remove it through this hole on 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.440
 on the right in this case is a little bit 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.440
 bigger 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.390
 we hooked 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.550
 and we are taking out the garments 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.879
 you have to look that always comes out 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:07.680
 the finest part that does not get us 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:07.680
 heaps so I can get out there 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.430
 in this way we can release the lid 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.130
 a little bit 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.890
 Hello 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:51.490
 and now we already have ready to be able 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:54.040
 lift our board then we put the 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.800
 wire we hooked as I explained 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.569
 above and we spin the drum 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.289
 a little 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:04.379
 ay we release the wire 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:07.259
 and we can turn it around 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:10.409
 this form will remain open here you can 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:14.159
 note that the problem he had is the 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:15.470
 Broken spring has been lowered and does not reach 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:19.250
 to work 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:21.740
 how is this saw well moves this 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.990
 the spring is broken that's why it opened 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:27.050
 you have to change the springs that have 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:30.320
 here good friends I hope this video 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:32.720
 will be useful to someone because without 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.340
 Any doubt will happen to those who have 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.569
 this guy breaks it is very common this 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.429
 failure 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:40.169
 remember that here I am leaving you 

00:05:37.429 --> 00:05:43.199
 again on the list 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:46.580
 video with the most common flaw in the 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:48.949
 washing machine and here 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.110
 intel and channel remember to subscribe 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:54.340
 I like that that helps keep 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:59.110
 better positioned videos on youtube 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:59.110
 friends will be until we see each other 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.050
 to work 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.210
 palette 

00:06:29.679 --> 00:06:32.679
 and 

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:40.530
 Of course when this happens 

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.530
 always because the 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:47.410
 Of course when this happens it's 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.410
 because it is washed 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:53.920
 workers I say the clothes so 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.990
 Hello 

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:15.979
 Hello
