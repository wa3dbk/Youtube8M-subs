the the group me list and so we're all
over<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.450> mountain<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:49.020> we<00:01:49.470> could<00:01:49.590> text

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
over the mountain and we could text

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.280 
over the mountain and we could text
where<00:01:50.009> we<00:01:50.130> were<00:01:50.280> where<00:01:50.700> we<00:01:50.729> can<00:01:50.970> meet<00:01:51.060> up<00:01:51.290> and

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
where we were where we can meet up and

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.560 
where we were where we can meet up and
it<00:01:52.860> worked<00:01:53.040> pretty<00:01:53.159> pretty<00:01:53.759> well<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.390> don't

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
it worked pretty pretty well and I don't

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.050 
it worked pretty pretty well and I don't
was<00:01:54.659> just<00:01:54.810> sort<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.259> my<00:01:55.409> group<00:01:55.710> but<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.729> kind<00:01:57.000> of

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
was just sort of my group but it kind of

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.520 
was just sort of my group but it kind of
seemed<00:01:57.299> like<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.509> guy<00:01:57.810> thing<00:01:57.869> which<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.290> was<00:01:58.380> kind

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
seemed like a guy thing which I was kind

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.069 
seemed like a guy thing which I was kind
of<00:01:58.560> surprised<00:01:58.860> because<00:01:59.040> you<00:02:00.000> know<00:02:00.090> texting<00:02:00.990> is

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
of surprised because you know texting is

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.859 
of surprised because you know texting is
something<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.130> my<00:02:02.310> wife<00:02:02.549> does<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.210> kind<00:02:03.840> of

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
something that my wife does and kind of

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.469 
something that my wife does and kind of
me<00:02:03.990> think<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.290> women<00:02:04.469> do<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.950> lot<00:02:05.189> but<00:02:05.820> there's

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
me think that women do a lot but there's

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.850 
me think that women do a lot but there's
something<00:02:06.659> about<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.020> group<00:02:07.259> element<00:02:07.710> they

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
something about the group element they

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.760 
something about the group element they
just<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.190> women<00:02:08.220> just<00:02:08.580> refuse<00:02:09.060> to

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
just the women just refuse to

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.720 
just the women just refuse to
participate<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:11.250> we<00:02:11.370> didn't<00:02:11.520> know<00:02:11.550> where

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
participate and we didn't know where

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.960 
participate and we didn't know where
they<00:02:11.819> were

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
they were

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.850 
they were
so<00:02:13.720> didn't<00:02:13.900> really<00:02:14.050> work<00:02:14.170> out<00:02:14.290> in<00:02:14.470> that<00:02:14.650> in

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
so didn't really work out in that in

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.440 
so didn't really work out in that in
that<00:02:14.920> particular<00:02:15.220> instance<00:02:15.940> but<00:02:16.120> when<00:02:16.300> it<00:02:16.390> did

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
that particular instance but when it did

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.940 
that particular instance but when it did
work<00:02:16.630> I<00:02:16.840> thought<00:02:17.020> it<00:02:17.170> was<00:02:17.230> great<00:02:17.410> you<00:02:17.680> send<00:02:17.860> out

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
work I thought it was great you send out

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.710 
work I thought it was great you send out
one<00:02:18.130> text<00:02:18.370> everybody<00:02:19.210> gets<00:02:19.390> it<00:02:19.510> you<00:02:19.540> don't

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
one text everybody gets it you don't

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.510 
one text everybody gets it you don't
have<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:19.990> you<00:02:20.710> know<00:02:20.830> send<00:02:21.070> 100<00:02:21.400> different

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
have to you know send 100 different

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.370 
have to you know send 100 different
times<00:02:21.790> it's<00:02:22.090> pretty<00:02:22.270> basic<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.810> I<00:02:22.990> think<00:02:23.260> that

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
times it's pretty basic and I think that

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.500 
times it's pretty basic and I think that
the<00:02:23.470> reason<00:02:23.500> that<00:02:23.800> is<00:02:23.950> sort<00:02:24.130> of<00:02:24.160> all<00:02:25.150> of<00:02:25.450> a

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
the reason that is sort of all of a

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.850 
the reason that is sort of all of a
sudden<00:02:25.750> taking<00:02:26.050> off<00:02:26.200> you<00:02:26.440> have<00:02:26.590> not<00:02:26.710> just

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
sudden taking off you have not just

messaging<00:02:31.900> apps<00:02:32.140> is<00:02:32.500> because<00:02:33.220> you<00:02:34.180> know<00:02:34.300> you

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630

have apps on Android and apps on the
iphone<00:02:36.700> and<00:02:37.150> makes<00:02:37.270> it<00:02:37.390> a<00:02:37.450> lot<00:02:37.540> easier<00:02:37.600> to<00:02:38.340> just

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
iphone and makes it a lot easier to just

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.770 
iphone and makes it a lot easier to just
drive<00:02:39.640> it<00:02:39.700> from<00:02:39.910> there<00:02:40.180> well<00:02:40.510> sure<00:02:40.660> I<00:02:40.690> mean

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
drive it from there well sure I mean

drive it from there well sure I mean
this<00:02:40.990> is<00:02:41.050> almost<00:02:41.470> like<00:02:41.560> a<00:02:41.650> Twitter<00:02:41.980> sort<00:02:42.220> of

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
this is almost like a Twitter sort of

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.010 
this is almost like a Twitter sort of
thing<00:02:42.490> like<00:02:42.520> it's<00:02:42.820> a<00:02:43.150> short<00:02:43.360> message<00:02:43.510> service

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
thing like it's a short message service

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.860 
thing like it's a short message service
but<00:02:44.770> it's<00:02:45.100> completely<00:02:45.750> it's<00:02:46.750> completely

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
but it's completely it's completely

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.780 
but it's completely it's completely
agnostic<00:02:47.440> to<00:02:47.830> the<00:02:48.040> hardware<00:02:48.250> so<00:02:48.520> it's<00:02:48.670> all

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
agnostic to the hardware so it's all

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.430 
agnostic to the hardware so it's all
goes<00:02:48.970> through<00:02:49.150> your<00:02:49.240> phone<00:02:49.480> and<00:02:49.720> that's

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
goes through your phone and that's

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.140 
goes through your phone and that's
originally<00:02:50.860> what<00:02:51.010> text<00:02:51.610> messages<00:02:52.000> were

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
originally what text messages were

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.580 
originally what text messages were
designed<00:02:52.450> to<00:02:52.510> be<00:02:52.600> they<00:02:52.900> you<00:02:53.230> didn't<00:02:53.410> have<00:02:53.500> to

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
designed to be they you didn't have to

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:54.720 
designed to be they you didn't have to
have<00:02:53.680> a<00:02:53.740> special<00:02:53.920> app<00:02:54.160> on<00:02:54.280> your<00:02:54.370> phone<00:02:54.430> it<00:02:54.700> just

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
have a special app on your phone it just

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.300 
have a special app on your phone it just
worked<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.810> interesting<00:02:56.800> thing<00:02:56.860> about<00:02:56.980> this

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
worked the interesting thing about this

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.010 
worked the interesting thing about this
and<00:02:57.520> I<00:02:57.550> think<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:57.910> Achilles<00:02:58.390> heel<00:02:58.630> here<00:02:58.870> is

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
and I think the Achilles heel here is

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.410 
and I think the Achilles heel here is
that<00:02:59.260> this<00:02:59.980> really<00:03:00.340> runs<00:03:00.580> up<00:03:00.760> your<00:03:00.940> text<00:03:01.240> rate

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
that this really runs up your text rate

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.280 
that this really runs up your text rate
so<00:03:02.170> in<00:03:02.560> my<00:03:02.709> case<00:03:02.740> I<00:03:03.340> think<00:03:03.700> I<00:03:03.970> had<00:03:04.150> a<00:03:04.180> 200<00:03:04.870> text

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
so in my case I think I had a 200 text

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.740 
so in my case I think I had a 200 text
plan<00:03:05.500> on<00:03:05.830> my<00:03:06.190> iPhone<00:03:06.670> and<00:03:06.880> I<00:03:07.209> think<00:03:07.390> I<00:03:07.450> ran<00:03:07.600> it

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
plan on my iPhone and I think I ran it

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.310 
plan on my iPhone and I think I ran it
up<00:03:07.840> to<00:03:07.990> about<00:03:09.300> 533<00:03:10.300> and<00:03:10.600> so<00:03:10.810> you<00:03:10.900> get<00:03:11.020> charged

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
up to about 533 and so you get charged

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.570 
up to about 533 and so you get charged
for<00:03:11.380> if<00:03:11.680> you<00:03:11.740> have<00:03:11.830> five<00:03:12.040> people<00:03:12.370> on<00:03:12.490> your

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
for if you have five people on your

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.940 
for if you have five people on your
group<00:03:12.820> you<00:03:12.970> get<00:03:13.060> 25<00:03:13.510> text<00:03:13.810> messages<00:03:14.230> well<00:03:14.560> the

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
group you get 25 text messages well the

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.410
