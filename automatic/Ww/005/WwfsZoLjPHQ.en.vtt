00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.140
 so well and now I think we are with you 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.160
 let's go to the passage 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.469
 directly racing from our sponsor 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.969
 from our sponsor we are now 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.280
 here here here we say 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.619
 not far away there is the first race from 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.320
 sponsor this is our sprint race therefore 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:25.320
 I think it's just we in Russia with us 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.880
 We have time to get away to go nafig cursor so it is in 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.080
 us right ahead is yes that 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.590
 we don't even have to fold anywhere 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.140
 you just need to drive yourself and at the same time 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.390
 get to the specified point and go through this 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.239
 I hope to race with you 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.640
 befitting from frankie 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.469
 sprint sponsor 2 or last does not have 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.700
 values ​​sponsored race to go 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.840
 in order to find the best of the best 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.190
 moment here can be the main 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.930
 basis for future contracts therefore 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.239
 try to show yourself 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.610
 arcane friends here, we need your 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.610
 will try my best 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.820
 well let's try 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.310
 promax to athens 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:12.290
 God counted what are you all 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.850
 aggressive so well at least me 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.100
 pleases one so far we are on the second 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.090
 print location until I looked at the table I 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.770
 bumped so here's a guy of course me 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.750
 pretty much annoying fact that he 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:28.180
 doesn't want to give up at all who we are 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.440
 I wonder such a by going with us here oh 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.030
 guy 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.580
 Rashid Lord, Rashid Highest Guy 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:39.350
 where from the far east is your 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:41.330
 my eyes are melting 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.280
 it would seem yes everyone else is now 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.970
 far in the ass excuse me of course 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.850
 expressions and just sew an hour just us 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.380
 separates from the first place and damn necessary 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.690
 do pretty well really 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.640
 I don’t know why but its impossible 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.720
 catch up now speed will just be 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.369
 200 and it does not overtake no all friends 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.330
 still we got around the main thing now 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:07.550
 of course this place is not to lose so 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.259
 fine just friends still in what 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.510
 really problems to look for here 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.209
 for this particular machine and and let's say 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.160
 so driving style that is how we 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.880
 you believe yourself in civic 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.220
 for this car is suitable in the root honestly 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.200
 that is, this car is different from her 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.600
 everything is not different handling on the other 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.460
 my power is completely different and 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.640
 really just need specifically 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.380
 relearn but in principle i can't 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.510
 to say that I'm not straight at all 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.580
 imagine how and manage i'm already in 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.340
 principle probably not on the right track i 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.850
 developed this or that scheme which 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.560
 principle can we let win but 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.300
 here unfortunately so far her apparently 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.740
 I use not very well because as 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.920
 visibility finish line we need 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.690
 accelerate very much but why are you 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.900
 so far this is not working god forbid 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.900
 god forbid me now somebody 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.880
 bypass well have friends this victory 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.800
 By the way, the victory is not so 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.980
 brilliantly what could have been 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:10.550
 grader apparently rating we have here with 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.840
 by you and we will not get any ask 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.790
 forgiveness is not friends we are still with you 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.780
 got literally hundreds of ratings 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:20.750
 reputations all money prize we have 1150 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.750
 that's cool too we all keep an account 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.310
 record and that's good that is with us in 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.290
 In principle, now there is money for it 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.990
 so that new message 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.300
 hoof hoof hoof hoof and new 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.400
 bonnet and in all body shops 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.980
 Parts of today I do not have 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.880
 thank you we don't need them 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:42.830
 the hood and so just drive so what 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.340
 one race less apparently yes we already have from 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.590
 sponsor 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.510
 so and we have another one some 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.920
 nearest we have drag racing she 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.989
 we are, by the way, friends 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.989
 very far from here 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.200
 you know what friends let's in this series 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.510
 then we 'll just be right back 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.580
 back to the car paint shop there 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.340
 we will bring your car to mind 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.020
 received money and after that already 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.080
 the next episode we'll go to 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.270
 generation from all other races like 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:16.430
 once a break between the series I go there and 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:19.880
 doedu so we need to right carefully 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.440
 oh chemic fence to call in friends 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.810
 Of course there is no pancake and just took 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:28.130
 arrived now will turn back to food 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:30.949
 what silly questions so applications 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:35.419
 the bottom layer is it here we had if not 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:39.979
 wrong somewhere here in the totem if i don't 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:42.889
 I am mistaken how the living do not take this one 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:45.860
 wow or this one I don't remember 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:47.330
 my you then you add order order 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.979
 and here we have friends and just goes 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.729
 the choice of colors that is from the first trace 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:54.650
 You can combine to play absolutely any 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:58.220
 for example i can take it let's say 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:02.960
 light green why not good color 2 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:04.789
 peduncle yo this lane take it 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.720
 probably white simply 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:11.539
 and here you can take lime again 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.800
 such know alternating effect that is 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:14.780
 of course one could come here often 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.240
 stick it all over all but it will be 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.889
 too somehow don't know colorful not 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.169
 colorful truth is not a sign you can write 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:25.960
 just like that it seems to me to be where 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:29.330
 better we don't need stickers 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:32.510
 you have a cool and stylish and stickers 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:36.020
 sponsor eternal glory yah nafig I 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:38.060
 I work only for myself because it is not 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.940
 I know I don’t need some stickers 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:43.909
 I will not spam my car 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:46.880
 I do not know anyone or bar fishing so 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:48.919
 in general can be called so back in 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:53.750
 the city before the bad of course ordered 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:56.620
 work and now i'm actually not now 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:59.180
 I remember you and me 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.370
 already put and hood and everything is all all 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.599
 the rest or are we still the site is not 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:07.639

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:10.159
 in my no hood we have them too now 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:14.719

 DJ hait ussr some sibiu not even 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:31.550
 I really know something 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:37.310
 put here it seems to me pretty 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:39.740
 looks good sibil let's put 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:41.960
 why not air intakes 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.000
 air intakes are actually here 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.740
 I do not see the meaning of their code and big 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.349
 put it but you can still put 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.690

 not dead money okay well go well 

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:03.349
 one more race and then we can still 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.529
 afford to make noise and what's more 

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:08.599

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:14.360

 that you yourself will ride this to and 

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.009
