00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:08.160
 hello very good everyone I'm maximan and you 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.860
 I bring back an interest a secret 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:15.539
 hidden in the game and this time it comes 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:19.769
 of a UFO a flying saucer under the 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:21.750
 starry sea deteriorated and with many 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:24.990
 traits that is super abandoned 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.960
 for a long time and it can be 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:32.640
 since the beginning of the game since it 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.620
 mark on that site and from that time not from 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.490
 about nine years ago as marked in the 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.680
 beginning of the game 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:44.110
 and you know well there I put the location 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.300
 of the map you have to take as a point of 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.940
 reference the straight line 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.309
 to horizontal and vertical vouchers and 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.530
 You can find the first 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:59.600
 you will find the flying saucer there 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:01.449
 you see the image in slow motion so that 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.970
 I watched him carefully you see 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:07.100
 perfectly and good is really 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.380
 incredible looks very abandoned of makes 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:14.729
 a lot of time is not a few days 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.729
 and good 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:22.500
 to see here is where I found the 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.210
 the oxygen cylinder can go from 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.130
 different ways if you've spent a game 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.939
 can we buy you a helicopter 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:33.750
 of cargo you can go with the submarine but 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:37.170
 good for all for all you can catch 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.690
 you can get here, okay, I marked it in 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.890
 the map so you can reach all 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.080
 I have done it so that everyone 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.180
 can you experience it and can 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.370
 do it you do not have to need 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:55.110
 buy nothing or nothing you have to get to 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:56.840
 this cargo of ships and on this ship you 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.760
 you go up and it's like you get on a 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.190
 helicopter to a plane that you equipped 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.770
 with one with a parachute because the same 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.300
 you get on this boat I do not know if with all 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.009
 the boats works with this boat 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.189
 works 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.110
 if you ride and then get off you have the 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:16.630
 oxygen cylinder you can breathe low 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.840
 the water does not die you do not drown 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.980
 and it is perfectly 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.870
 another side and I tell you here I bring you 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.710

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.200
