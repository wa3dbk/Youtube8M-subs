00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.500
 It is the first time that a similar event is recorded in our country 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.680
 dozens of children were more than surprised by what their eyes 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.680
 observed on our sky 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.199
 by implying said 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:21.699
 also the German 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.449
 this strange and surprising show recorded in Lima two years ago 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:30.980
 days 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.870
 was caught by a news team 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.610
 for more than 30 minutes a diversity of white spots was observed 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.130
 forming figures in the sky 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.020
 it's an interesting topic 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.070
 however it remains an anomalous air phenomenon because it is not 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.290
 checked 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.590
 and we have a technical explanation obtained appropriate coherent curds 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.360
 as to say what is 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.870
 a state the commander of the Peruvian air force July Chamorro 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.110
 was cautious in asserting about possible and extraterrestrials but if not provided 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.320
 video images where you can see this same phenomenon recorded in 1994 and 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.540
 1995 on the sky of several Mexican cities 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.469
 maricel air traffic controllers and what is it about 

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:18.600
 because I could even 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.260
 it could be though it has never happened that I put Ee in trouble to him the 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.860
 air operations in general not 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.520
 these sightings 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.410
 must be studied by a spatial space system office as it exists in 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.410
 countries like chile brasil argentina and mexico 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.950
 that is the first recorded seismic record 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.210
 not only in this capital 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.179
 of aerial phenomena walk evils 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:42.240
 in large quantity 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.420
 that will serve for investigations 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.220
 and that makes us ask if we are alone in the universe 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.689
 francisco aranda miranda 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:51.570
 to news 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.460
 but not only
