00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 hello as you can see we have removed 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.059
 the strings to this Spanish guitar or 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:12.150
 classic that everyone can do 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:14.490
 this little thing here we take it off 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.490
 flame segueta and is where they are supported 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.279
 the ropes 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.849
 and this part is higher than this one 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.560
 here because here go the fat ropes 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.660
 the last strings and here the first 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.570
 the finest strings 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.030
 we put it in its place 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.670
 A) Yes 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.400
 first rope second third until the 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.020
 sixth 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.690
 we have bought a set of ropes 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.580
 new here we have the sixth string and 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.580
 let's proceed to put it 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:52.850
 we take one end of the sixth string the 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:56.120
 more fat 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.760
 and I'm going to explain it like me 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.310
 They explained making small knots with the 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.760
 snake and the little tree 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:08.060
 we have here the serpent come 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:11.720
 enter here through this little hole 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:16.120
 here prepared for the sixth string 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.120
 we have an outgoing 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.880
 of a few centimeters 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.230
 and here we have a little tree and here to me 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.640
 right the snake 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:34.460
 the snake skirts the tree for its 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:38.230
 right happens behind him like this and he 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.230
 it is like this this form of u 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:46.159
 and now the snake 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:51.399
 he passes over him and is given a 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.399
 back to the same stretch 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.409
 we are left 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.509
 that way 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.509
 is the knot as a kind of 8 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:09.319
 and we already have the sixth string there 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.540
 placed on the bridge the same applies 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.750
 to all the strings of the guitar at 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.450
 six in this case we're going to take a 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.049
 third new rope we took it out of its 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:24.250
 over the extend we take an extreme and 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:28.840
 same procedure 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:31.870
 123 third hole then come 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.440
 we put the snake for the third 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.440
 little hole 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.430
 we have a few centimeters left so that 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.850
 I can go around here tree here 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.310
 snake 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.580
 I know I'm a bit childish but it 's 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.730
 the best way to understand it 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.290
 we have the tree the snake come 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.000
 the snake goes to the right of the 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:00.990
 little tree and borders 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.710
 we already have it like that and now she herself 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.710
 pass over 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.780
 Y 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.850
 we give it another pass to the 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:17.680
 fine strings from the first to the third 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:20.549
 we give extra spin our turn so 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.549
 we throw 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.830
 and it stays like that 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.390
 and the second part is to place the rope 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.940
 in the pegbox 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:39.319
 the sixth fifth quarter is here 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:42.050
 third second and first string we 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:45.819
 we go to the headstock wheel of the 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:49.540
 sixth string we spin 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:51.670
 towards us until this little hole 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.159
 from here it gets looking up or 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.379
 towards us we have the end of the 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:59.049
 rope we continue with our explanation 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:00.510
 childish and the snake gets in 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:04.250
 above 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.030
 towards the hole inside 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:11.459
 A) Yes 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:14.240
 well now we have here the snake what 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:19.519
 what you do is that this hole here 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:24.020
 here again the snake out there 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:26.880
 so and now we turn the 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.630
 tree now down 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.100
 A) Yes 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:35.520
 it's worth below 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:38.900
 and the snake returns to its place by 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.900
 where he has come from 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.970
 Over there 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.970
 and you see that it stays 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:57.180
 a form of um 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.180
 Well, you already have it and now 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:02.320
 you spin and the pegbox for 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:06.190
 think 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:08.370
 this you put here at its root and you give it 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.370
 turns 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.790
 and texas 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.129
 and you have it 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.379
 for the rest of the strings it is the same 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:24.780
 procedure we are going to take for example 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:27.030
 the third we jump to the third we take 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.070
 the other extreme here we have it 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.920
 pegbox 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:34.560
 the hole looking towards us or 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:37.370
 up and there the snake goes 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.370
 strain through the hole 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.970
 A) Yes 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:46.260
 the snake comes from the left by 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.449
 here goes up 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.100
 AHA 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:55.040
 very well 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:55.040
 and now behind the little tree 

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:58.189
 A) Yes 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:04.770
 you see that they stay in the shape of the us and come back 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.770
 where he has come from 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.360
 and we think
