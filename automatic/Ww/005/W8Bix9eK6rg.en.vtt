00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
MDF there's four layers just kind of

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.060 
MDF there's four layers just kind of
plastered<00:00:30.300> together<00:00:30.630> some<00:00:31.230> nails<00:00:31.439> in<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.830> and

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
plastered together some nails in it and

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.100 
plastered together some nails in it and
I<00:00:32.790> just<00:00:33.000> used<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.300> dremel<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.719> go<00:00:33.809> around<00:00:34.020> the

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
I just used a dremel to go around the

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.370 
I just used a dremel to go around the
edges<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.710> really<00:00:35.430> poorly<00:00:35.910> make<00:00:36.480> this<00:00:36.780> I'm

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
edges and really poorly make this I'm

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.540 
edges and really poorly make this I'm
hoping<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.680> do<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.829> bit<00:00:38.010> better<00:00:38.160> with<00:00:38.340> this

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
hoping to do a bit better with this

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.280 
hoping to do a bit better with this
energy<00:00:38.820> sword<00:00:39.180> now<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.570> may<00:00:39.690> be<00:00:39.719> difficult<00:00:40.050> to

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
energy sword now it may be difficult to

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.369 
energy sword now it may be difficult to
see<00:00:40.790> but<00:00:41.790> I'm<00:00:42.360> going<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.570> make<00:00:42.750> this<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.200> same

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
see but I'm going to make this the same

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.709 
see but I'm going to make this the same
way<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:43.620> made<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.340> assault<00:00:44.700> rifle<00:00:45.120> which<00:00:45.510> is

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
way I made the assault rifle which is

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.770 
way I made the assault rifle which is
basically<00:00:46.260> just<00:00:46.590> use<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.739> projector<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.629> put<00:00:48.629> an

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
basically just use a projector to put an

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.410 
basically just use a projector to put an
image<00:00:48.989> up<00:00:49.350> on<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.590> screen<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.340> then<00:00:50.879> adjust<00:00:51.270> it

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
image up on a screen and then adjust it

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.479 
image up on a screen and then adjust it
to<00:00:51.629> make<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.960> however<00:00:52.170> big<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:52.920> need<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.309> be

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
to make it however big I need it to be

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.410 
to make it however big I need it to be
draw<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.420> out<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.780> then<00:00:54.870> cut<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.500> out<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:56.420> guess

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
draw it out and then cut it out I guess

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.939 
draw it out and then cut it out I guess
while<00:00:57.600> cutting<00:00:57.809> us<00:00:57.960> out<00:00:58.140> big<00:00:58.350> it's<00:00:58.620> time<00:00:58.800> to

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
while cutting us out big it's time to

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.220 
while cutting us out big it's time to
tell<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.340> I'm<00:01:00.180> not<00:01:00.510> really<00:01:00.719> sure<00:01:01.020> which

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
tell you that I'm not really sure which

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.560 
tell you that I'm not really sure which
halo<00:01:01.620> this<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:02.219> from<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.879> by<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.390> mean

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
halo this is from and by that I mean

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.570 
halo this is from and by that I mean
it's<00:01:03.719> not<00:01:03.780> really<00:01:04.019> from<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.650> specific<00:01:05.010> Halo

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
it's not really from a specific Halo

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.690 
it's not really from a specific Halo
game<00:01:05.900> if<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:07.229> remember<00:01:07.560> correctly<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:08.520> is

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
game if I remember correctly and this is

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.210 
game if I remember correctly and this is
Steve<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.780> design<00:01:10.140> from<00:01:10.350> Halo<00:01:10.680> Reach<00:01:10.710> or

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
Steve of the design from Halo Reach or

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.580 
Steve of the design from Halo Reach or
Halo<00:01:11.490> 4<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.180> printed<00:01:12.510> out<00:01:12.689> but<00:01:13.470> it's

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
Halo 4 that I printed out but it's

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.190 
Halo 4 that I printed out but it's
definitely<00:01:13.770> not<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.250> right<00:01:14.610> size<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.420> just

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
definitely not the right size I just

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.990 
definitely not the right size I just
decided<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.680> having<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.310> be<00:01:17.430> three<00:01:17.790> feet

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
decided that having it be three feet

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.420 
decided that having it be three feet
long<00:01:18.299> or<00:01:18.570> roughly<00:01:18.990> three<00:01:19.590> feet<00:01:19.619> would<00:01:20.400> be

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
long or roughly three feet would be

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.380 
long or roughly three feet would be
about<00:01:21.229> you<00:01:22.229> know<00:01:22.380> decent<00:01:22.680> size<00:01:23.180> now<00:01:24.180> you'll

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
about you know decent size now you'll

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.620 
about you know decent size now you'll
notice<00:01:24.540> I've<00:01:24.900> only<00:01:25.380> cut<00:01:26.280> out<00:01:26.310> one<00:01:27.090> side<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.570> the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
notice I've only cut out one side of the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.719 
notice I've only cut out one side of the
blade<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.259> have<00:01:28.409> not<00:01:28.560> cut<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.890> handle<00:01:29.310> that

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
blade and I have not cut the handle that

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.670 
blade and I have not cut the handle that
is<00:01:30.119> because<00:01:30.780> I'm<00:01:30.900> going<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.049> take<00:01:31.229> two<00:01:31.470> pieces

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
is because I'm going to take two pieces

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.890 
is because I'm going to take two pieces
of<00:01:31.890> wood<00:01:32.189> tape<00:01:32.579> them<00:01:32.790> together<00:01:32.939> put<00:01:33.450> the

out on the bandsaw and then boom I have

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.840 
out on the bandsaw and then boom I have
two<00:01:40.079> identical<00:01:40.320> blades<00:01:40.950> we'll<00:01:41.549> get<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.759> the

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
two identical blades we'll get to the

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:55.130 
two identical blades we'll get to the
handle<00:01:42.210> later

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.500 

now<00:01:56.010> I<00:01:56.040> would<00:01:56.310> love<00:01:56.580> to<00:01:56.790> cut<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.090> out<00:01:57.270> on<00:01:57.420> the

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
now I would love to cut this out on the

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.990 
now I would love to cut this out on the
bandsaw<00:01:58.020> but<00:01:58.320> unfortunately<00:01:59.130> this<00:01:59.550> is<00:01:59.610> far

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
bandsaw but unfortunately this is far

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.600 
bandsaw but unfortunately this is far
too<00:02:00.210> heavy<00:02:00.480> or<00:02:00.720> like<00:02:01.050> an<00:02:01.230> old<00:02:01.500> bandsaw<00:02:01.980> and<00:02:02.190> I

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
too heavy or like an old bandsaw and I

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
so I don't have a hand that can fit that

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.330 
so I don't have a hand that can fit that
that's<00:02:45.500> just<00:02:45.590> going<00:02:45.770> to<00:02:45.830> be<00:02:45.890> really<00:02:46.100> painful

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
that's just going to be really painful

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.110 
that's just going to be really painful
to<00:02:46.640> hold<00:02:46.880> but<00:02:47.720> this<00:02:48.320> is<00:02:48.500> 9<00:02:48.710> inches<00:02:49.100> wide<00:02:49.160> the

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
blade on my table saw is already set to

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.010 
blade on my table saw is already set to
3/8<00:02:52.430> of<00:02:52.700> an<00:02:52.820> inch<00:02:52.940> and<00:02:53.360> I<00:02:53.570> have<00:02:53.750> some

3/8 of an inch and I have some
three-quarter<00:02:54.560> inch<00:02:54.710> scrap<00:02:55.100> I'm<00:02:55.370> just<00:02:55.520> going

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
three-quarter inch scrap I'm just going

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:18.360 
three-quarter inch scrap I'm just going
to<00:02:55.670> make<00:02:55.940> the<00:02:56.120> handle<00:02:56.540> out<00:02:56.720> of<00:02:57.290> not<00:02:57.740> dowel<00:02:58.580> rods

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.710 

here<00:03:19.370> are<00:03:19.460> the<00:03:19.550> two<00:03:19.700> pieces<00:03:19.940> for<00:03:20.270> the<00:03:20.330> handle

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
here are the two pieces for the handle

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.030 
here are the two pieces for the handle
and<00:03:21.310> when<00:03:22.310> they<00:03:22.460> go<00:03:22.640> together<00:03:23.770> this<00:03:24.770> should

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
and when they go together this should

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.700 
and when they go together this should
fit<00:03:25.370> right<00:03:25.400> in<00:03:25.850> between<00:03:26.230> and<00:03:27.230> kind<00:03:27.440> of<00:03:27.530> does

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:27.710 
fit right in between and kind of does

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.280 
fit right in between and kind of does
it's<00:03:28.370> going<00:03:28.460> to<00:03:28.520> be<00:03:28.640> pretty<00:03:28.820> snug<00:03:29.090> though<00:03:29.360> so

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
it's going to be pretty snug though so

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.370 
it's going to be pretty snug though so
it'll<00:03:30.380> be<00:03:30.500> something<00:03:30.710> kind<00:03:31.010> of<00:03:31.100> like<00:03:31.250> this

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
it'll be something kind of like this

00:03:32.380 --> 00:04:02.070 
it'll be something kind of like this
it's<00:03:33.380> actually<00:03:33.800> pretty<00:03:33.950> cool

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.540 

and<00:04:03.080> now<00:04:03.530> I'm<00:04:03.620> going<00:04:03.739> to<00:04:03.800> use<00:04:03.830> the<00:04:04.040> router<00:04:04.250> to

blades<00:04:56.389> need<00:04:56.570> to<00:04:56.750> be<00:04:56.870> so<00:04:57.380> that<00:04:57.560> the<00:04:57.680> handle

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
blades need to be so that the handle

00:04:58.039 --> 00:04:59.230 
blades need to be so that the handle
will<00:04:58.190> be<00:04:58.220> in<00:04:58.370> the<00:04:58.460> right<00:04:58.610> spot

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
will be in the right spot

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.520 
will be in the right spot
now<00:04:59.389> I've<00:04:59.539> measured<00:04:59.750> the<00:04:59.990> template<00:05:00.380> that<00:05:00.410> I

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
now I've measured the template that I

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.770 
now I've measured the template that I
have<00:05:00.800> and<00:05:01.100> the<00:05:01.340> distance<00:05:01.789> between<00:05:01.880> the<00:05:02.450> blades

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
have and the distance between the blades

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.810 
have and the distance between the blades
should<00:05:03.080> be<00:05:03.229> an<00:05:03.320> inch<00:05:03.470> and<00:05:03.680> a<00:05:03.740> half<00:05:03.770> so<00:05:04.490> I<00:05:04.520> cut

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
should be an inch and a half so I cut

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.370 
should be an inch and a half so I cut
this<00:05:04.970> board<00:05:05.270> to<00:05:05.750> be<00:05:05.870> an<00:05:05.960> inch<00:05:06.139> and<00:05:06.320> a<00:05:06.350> half

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
this board to be an inch and a half

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.560 
this board to be an inch and a half
thick<00:05:06.860> so<00:05:07.130> that<00:05:07.280> when<00:05:07.400> I<00:05:07.430> set<00:05:07.760> it<00:05:07.789> in<00:05:08.000> here

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
thick so that when I set it in here

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.020 
thick so that when I set it in here
bring<00:05:08.780> the<00:05:08.900> blades<00:05:09.169> together<00:05:09.470> now<00:05:10.250> over<00:05:10.700> here

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
bring the blades together now over here

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.820 
bring the blades together now over here
I<00:05:11.060> can<00:05:11.360> figure<00:05:11.570> out<00:05:11.690> where<00:05:11.900> nine<00:05:12.200> inches<00:05:12.620> is

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
I can figure out where nine inches is

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.070 
I can figure out where nine inches is
between<00:05:13.310> the<00:05:13.700> back<00:05:13.910> ends<00:05:14.300> of<00:05:14.450> the<00:05:14.539> blade<00:05:14.780> so

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
between the back ends of the blade so

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.050 
between the back ends of the blade so
that<00:05:15.260> I<00:05:15.440> can<00:05:15.740> put<00:05:15.950> the<00:05:16.220> handle<00:05:16.610> in<00:05:16.820> the<00:05:16.910> right

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
that I can put the handle in the right

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.629 
that I can put the handle in the right
spot<00:05:17.470> now<00:05:18.470> that<00:05:18.620> I<00:05:18.650> have<00:05:18.800> the<00:05:18.889> handle<00:05:19.250> glued<00:05:19.460> in

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 
spot now that I have the handle glued in

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:21.610 
spot now that I have the handle glued in
I'm<00:05:19.910> going<00:05:20.150> to<00:05:20.210> take<00:05:20.450> the<00:05:20.570> nailer<00:05:20.870> and<00:05:20.900> schroot

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:34.120 
I'm going to take the nailer and schroot

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
probably going to clean it up a little

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.120 
probably going to clean it up a little
bit<00:05:39.080> more<00:05:39.260> but<00:05:39.470> I<00:05:39.530> think<00:05:39.560> this<00:05:39.860> is<00:05:39.950> still

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.310 
bit more but I think this is still
