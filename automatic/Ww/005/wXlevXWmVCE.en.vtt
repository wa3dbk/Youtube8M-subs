the<00:01:14.100> problem<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.700> automotive<00:01:15.659> GPS<00:01:16.140> was<00:01:16.439> an

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
the problem of automotive GPS was an

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.200 
the problem of automotive GPS was an
important<00:01:17.040> one<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.159> solve<00:01:17.490> but<00:01:17.850> you're<00:01:17.970> still

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
important one to solve but you're still

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.149 
important one to solve but you're still
within<00:01:18.509> an<00:01:18.750> infrastructure<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.500> guides<00:01:19.860> you

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
within an infrastructure that guides you

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.710 
within an infrastructure that guides you
but<00:01:20.640> when<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.790> anyone<00:01:21.240> who's<00:01:21.360> been<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.630> the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
caught in a and an off-road location

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.870 
caught in a and an off-road location
really<00:01:27.270> needs<00:01:27.479> gps<00:01:27.780> so<00:01:28.320> now<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:29.310> can<00:01:29.490> have<00:01:29.700> the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
really needs gps so now you can have the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.969 
really needs gps so now you can have the
GPS<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.540> show<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:30.780> where<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.200> are<00:01:31.229> but<00:01:31.890> you

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
GPS to show you where you are but you

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.700 
GPS to show you where you are but you
can<00:01:32.130> also<00:01:32.310> send<00:01:32.790> your<00:01:33.030> location<00:01:33.689> because<00:01:34.560> this

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
can also send your location because this

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.410 
can also send your location because this
will<00:01:34.890> also<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.369> satellite<00:01:35.759> system<00:01:36.090> will<00:01:36.180> send

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
will also the satellite system will send

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.539 
will also the satellite system will send
your<00:01:36.540> actual<00:01:36.869> location<00:01:37.470> back<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.009> web<00:01:38.280> page

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
your actual location back to a web page

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.609 
your actual location back to a web page
so<00:01:38.909> people<00:01:38.939> can<00:01:39.360> track<00:01:39.600> your<00:01:39.780> progress<00:01:39.990> as

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
it I think of the warm up from a mapping

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.749 
it I think of the warm up from a mapping
standpoint<00:01:46.140> that's<00:01:46.920> absolutely<00:01:47.490> true

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759

right<00:02:31.750> so<00:02:31.960> one<00:02:32.080> of<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.260> new<00:02:32.410> things<00:02:32.440> that

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
right so one of the new things that

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.410 
right so one of the new things that
delorme<00:02:33.160> is<00:02:33.370> doing<00:02:33.700> is<00:02:33.850> we're<00:02:34.060> going<00:02:34.150> to<00:02:34.210> have

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
delorme is doing is we're going to have

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.650 
delorme is doing is we're going to have
wireless<00:02:34.780> for<00:02:35.530> up<00:02:35.920> to<00:02:36.130> one<00:02:36.340> mile<00:02:36.640> for<00:02:37.420> team

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
wireless for up to one mile for team

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.900 
wireless for up to one mile for team
tracking<00:02:38.110> so<00:02:38.530> multiple<00:02:39.040> people<00:02:39.400> can<00:02:39.580> go<00:02:39.730> out

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
tracking so multiple people can go out

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.360 
tracking so multiple people can go out
and<00:02:40.240> they<00:02:40.750> can<00:02:40.930> see<00:02:41.140> each<00:02:41.320> other's<00:02:41.650> location

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
and they can see each other's location

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.180 
and they can see each other's location
so<00:02:42.580> imagine<00:02:43.740> firefighters<00:02:44.740> that<00:02:44.890> are<00:02:45.040> going

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
so imagine firefighters that are going

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.010 
so imagine firefighters that are going
into<00:02:45.459> a<00:02:45.580> situation<00:02:45.850> and<00:02:46.390> they<00:02:46.480> need<00:02:46.690> to<00:02:46.810> see

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
into a situation and they need to see

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.380 
into a situation and they need to see
where<00:02:47.260> each<00:02:47.530> other<00:02:48.130> is<00:02:48.310> as<00:02:48.730> they're<00:02:48.880> going<00:02:49.240> and

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
where each other is as they're going and

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.480 
where each other is as they're going and
one<00:02:49.990> of<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.170> things<00:02:50.440> that's<00:02:50.650> new<00:02:50.950> about<00:02:50.980> the

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
one of the things that's new about the

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.610 
one of the things that's new about the
wireless<00:02:52.000> we're<00:02:52.209> using<00:02:52.480> is<00:02:52.870> a<00:02:53.110> lot<00:02:53.470> of

wireless we're using is a lot of

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.740 
wireless we're using is a lot of
wireless<00:02:53.800> systems<00:02:54.430> require<00:02:54.850> a<00:02:54.880> coordinator

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
wireless systems require a coordinator

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.420 
wireless systems require a coordinator
and<00:02:56.050> when<00:02:56.140> that<00:02:56.290> coordinator<00:02:56.830> drops<00:02:57.190> out

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
and when that coordinator drops out

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.910 
and when that coordinator drops out
everyone<00:02:57.910> drops<00:02:58.209> out<00:02:58.450> this<00:02:59.050> technology

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
everyone drops out this technology

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.330 
everyone drops out this technology
doesn't<00:03:00.550> require<00:03:00.910> coordinator<00:03:02.190> where<00:03:03.190> can

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
doesn't require coordinator where can

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.860 
doesn't require coordinator where can
people<00:03:03.370> go<00:03:03.670> to<00:03:03.760> find<00:03:03.940> out<00:03:04.270> more<00:03:04.600> information
