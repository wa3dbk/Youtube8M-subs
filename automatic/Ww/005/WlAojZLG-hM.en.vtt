hi there YouTube been watching quite a
lot<00:01:27.520> of<00:01:27.550> videos<00:01:27.640> recently<00:01:28.450> about<00:01:28.690> people

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
lot of videos recently about people

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.960 
lot of videos recently about people
setting<00:01:29.680> up<00:01:29.740> their<00:01:29.920> own<00:01:30.040> solar<00:01:30.670> power<00:01:31.380> systems

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
setting up their own solar power systems

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.760 
setting up their own solar power systems
so<00:01:33.970> I<00:01:34.030> decided<00:01:34.300> to<00:01:34.390> set<00:01:34.600> one<00:01:34.720> up<00:01:34.840> for<00:01:35.110> my<00:01:35.560> dad's

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
so I decided to set one up for my dad's

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.770 
so I decided to set one up for my dad's
shed<00:01:36.130> I<00:01:36.400> just<00:01:37.210> thought<00:01:37.300> I'd<00:01:37.390> show<00:01:37.480> you<00:01:37.600> the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
shed I just thought I'd show you the

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.730 
shed I just thought I'd show you the
result<00:01:38.910> what<00:01:39.910> we've<00:01:40.060> done<00:01:40.330> is<00:01:40.630> on<00:01:41.260> top<00:01:41.500> of<00:01:41.650> the

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
result what we've done is on top of the

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.090 
result what we've done is on top of the
shed<00:01:41.950> itself<00:01:42.400> we've<00:01:43.270> actually<00:01:43.479> got<00:01:43.840> a<00:01:43.990> 20<00:01:44.890> watt

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
shed itself we've actually got a 20 watt

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.740 
shed itself we've actually got a 20 watt
panel<00:01:46.290> angled<00:01:47.290> straight<00:01:47.470> up<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:49.090> that<00:01:49.270> the

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
panel angled straight up so that the

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.380 
panel angled straight up so that the
shed<00:01:49.990> can<00:01:50.800> give<00:01:50.950> it<00:01:51.070> some<00:01:51.310> light<00:01:51.550> for<00:01:51.790> most<00:01:51.970> of

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
shed can give it some light for most of

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.330 
shed can give it some light for most of
the<00:01:52.510> day<00:01:52.720> in<00:01:53.500> the<00:01:53.619> morning<00:01:53.979> and<00:01:54.130> in<00:01:54.280> the

afternoon<00:01:56.640> if<00:01:57.640> I<00:01:57.759> go<00:01:57.910> in<00:01:58.030> the<00:01:58.119> shed<00:01:58.270> I'll<00:01:58.450> show

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
afternoon if I go in the shed I'll show

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.390 
afternoon if I go in the shed I'll show
you<00:01:58.720> what<00:01:58.840> we<00:01:58.960> got<00:01:59.050> running<00:01:59.350> off<00:01:59.470> it<00:01:59.650> at<00:02:00.130> the

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
you what we got running off it at the

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.810 
you what we got running off it at the
moment<00:02:00.759> and<00:02:00.970> how<00:02:01.479> it's<00:02:01.630> set<00:02:01.810> up<00:02:01.840> now<00:02:02.610> first<00:02:03.610> of

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
moment and how it's set up now first of

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
moment and how it's set up now first of
all<00:02:04.080> up<00:02:05.080> here<00:02:05.440> on<00:02:05.650> the<00:02:05.830> roof<00:02:05.979> I<00:02:06.330> actually<00:02:07.330> have

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
all up here on the roof I actually have

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.310 
all up here on the roof I actually have
a<00:02:08.110> 12<00:02:08.920> volt<00:02:09.540> energy<00:02:10.540> saving<00:02:11.260> bulb<00:02:11.530> or<00:02:12.090> CFL

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
a 12 volt energy saving bulb or CFL

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.860 
a 12 volt energy saving bulb or CFL
whichever<00:02:14.320> you<00:02:14.470> call<00:02:15.370> yourself

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
whichever you call yourself

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.060 
whichever you call yourself
now<00:02:17.800> that's<00:02:18.040> running<00:02:18.820> along<00:02:19.090> a<00:02:19.120> wire<00:02:20.070> along

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
now that's running along a wire along

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.199 
now that's running along a wire along
the<00:02:21.250> roof<00:02:22.860> whoops

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
the roof whoops

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:31.500 
the roof whoops
going<00:02:25.209> down<00:02:25.420> here<00:02:27.959> across<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:31.120> up<00:02:31.239> to<00:02:31.420> this

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
going down here across and up to this

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.690 
going down here across and up to this
little<00:02:31.780> switch<00:02:31.959> in<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.500> door<00:02:35.100> so<00:02:36.100> if<00:02:36.220> I<00:02:36.370> just

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
little switch in the door so if I just

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.009 
little switch in the door so if I just
do<00:02:36.850> that<00:02:37.470> off<00:02:38.470> on<00:02:39.390> it's<00:02:40.390> daylight<00:02:40.810> at<00:02:40.959> the

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
do that off on it's daylight at the

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.240 
do that off on it's daylight at the
moment<00:02:41.350> so<00:02:41.440> you<00:02:41.530> can't<00:02:41.680> really<00:02:41.860> see<00:02:42.010> too<00:02:42.040> much

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
moment so you can't really see too much

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.890 
moment so you can't really see too much
of<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.519> difference<00:02:43.620> but<00:02:44.620> this<00:02:44.860> here<00:02:45.900> comes

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
of the difference but this here comes

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.670 
of the difference but this here comes
down<00:02:47.230> into<00:02:48.160> my<00:02:48.610> charge<00:02:48.970> controller<00:02:49.650> which<00:02:50.650> is

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
down into my charge controller which is

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.220 
down into my charge controller which is
a<00:02:50.830> 10<00:02:51.130> amp<00:02:51.340> charge<00:02:51.850> controller<00:02:53.220> now<00:02:54.220> here<00:02:55.230> we

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
a 10 amp charge controller now here we

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.280 
a 10 amp charge controller now here we
have<00:02:56.410> eight<00:02:56.730> we<00:02:57.730> have<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:58.150> standard<00:02:58.840> wire

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
have eight we have the standard wire

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.890 
have eight we have the standard wire
straight<00:02:59.769> from<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.070> solar<00:03:00.310> panel<00:03:00.900> which

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
straight from the solar panel which

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.050 
straight from the solar panel which
comes<00:03:02.440> in<00:03:02.620> to<00:03:02.739> shed<00:03:02.980> through<00:03:03.400> this<00:03:03.549> hole<00:03:03.820> which

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
comes in to shed through this hole which

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.080 
comes in to shed through this hole which
I've<00:03:04.299> put<00:03:04.930> sealant<00:03:05.230> on<00:03:05.560> stop<00:03:06.430> any<00:03:06.580> cold<00:03:06.850> or

up<00:03:22.720> to<00:03:23.110> I<00:03:23.140> believe<00:03:23.380> about<00:03:24.040> 70<00:03:24.700> amps<00:03:25.410> on<00:03:26.410> a<00:03:26.470> run

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
up to I believe about 70 amps on a run

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.150 
up to I believe about 70 amps on a run
that<00:03:27.489> this<00:03:27.790> short<00:03:28.350> this<00:03:29.350> is<00:03:29.410> mainly<00:03:30.010> for

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
that this short this is mainly for

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.340 
that this short this is mainly for
future<00:03:30.760> upgrade

again on eight gauge wires which can

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.770 
again on eight gauge wires which can
take<00:03:49.200> quite<00:03:49.500> a<00:03:49.560> lot<00:03:49.710> of<00:03:49.830> current<00:03:50.510> comes<00:03:51.510> up

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
take quite a lot of current comes up

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.560 
take quite a lot of current comes up
here<00:03:52.220> and<00:03:53.220> it<00:03:53.790> goes<00:03:53.880> into<00:03:54.210> my<00:03:54.930> mains<00:03:55.260> inverter

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
here and it goes into my mains inverter

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.420 
here and it goes into my mains inverter
now<00:03:57.570> this<00:03:57.780> is<00:03:57.870> only<00:03:57.990> a<00:03:58.110> small<00:03:58.260> inverter<00:03:58.830> it's

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
now this is only a small inverter it's

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.470 
now this is only a small inverter it's
it<00:04:00.360> will<00:04:00.480> convert<00:04:00.810> 12<00:04:01.170> volts<00:04:01.500> into<00:04:02.310> 300<00:04:03.270> watts

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
it will convert 12 volts into 300 watts

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.120 
it will convert 12 volts into 300 watts
at<00:04:04.310> 240<00:04:05.310> volts<00:04:05.580> power<00:04:06.500> for<00:04:07.500> safety

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
at 240 volts power for safety

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.900 
at 240 volts power for safety
I<00:04:08.160> have<00:04:08.940> also<00:04:09.180> earthed<00:04:09.660> this<00:04:10.440> so<00:04:11.400> this<00:04:11.550> cable

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
I have also earthed this so this cable

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.240 
I have also earthed this so this cable
you<00:04:11.940> see<00:04:12.180> here<00:04:12.480> goes<00:04:13.020> straight<00:04:13.290> into<00:04:13.440> it<00:04:13.680> so

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
you see here goes straight into it so

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.990 
you see here goes straight into it so
any<00:04:14.490> fuses<00:04:15.030> in<00:04:15.180> my<00:04:15.300> plugs<00:04:15.600> like<00:04:16.200> our<00:04:16.470> CDs<00:04:17.000> will

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
any fuses in my plugs like our CDs will

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.200 
any fuses in my plugs like our CDs will
work<00:04:18.180> perfectly<00:04:18.950> now<00:04:19.950> at<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.160> moment<00:04:20.340> it's

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:21.210 
work perfectly now at the moment it's

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:23.090 
work perfectly now at the moment it's
just<00:04:21.300> set<00:04:21.630> up<00:04:21.810> on<00:04:21.930> a<00:04:21.960> on<00:04:22.260> a<00:04:22.350> rough<00:04:22.620> set<00:04:22.890> up

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
just set up on a on a rough set up

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.600 
just set up on a on a rough set up
eventually<00:04:24.090> this<00:04:24.600> little<00:04:24.840> 4-way<00:04:25.620> wire<00:04:26.250> is

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
eventually this little 4-way wire is

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.850 
eventually this little 4-way wire is
going<00:04:26.850> to<00:04:26.910> be<00:04:27.030> attached<00:04:27.330> to<00:04:27.360> the<00:04:27.630> wall<00:04:27.810> but<00:04:28.770> at

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
going to be attached to the wall but at

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.740 
going to be attached to the wall but at
the<00:04:28.950> moment<00:04:29.900> it's<00:04:30.900> currently<00:04:31.350> charging<00:04:31.800> up

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
the moment it's currently charging up

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.440 
the moment it's currently charging up
one<00:04:33.750> of<00:04:33.840> my<00:04:33.900> drill<00:04:34.170> batteries<00:04:35.030> it's<00:04:36.030> also

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
one of my drill batteries it's also

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.380 
one of my drill batteries it's also
running<00:04:36.930> this<00:04:37.230> mains<00:04:37.680> powered<00:04:38.340> light<00:04:38.580> it's<00:04:39.300> a

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
running this mains powered light it's a

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.080 
running this mains powered light it's a
mains<00:04:39.630> powered<00:04:40.080> CFL<00:04:40.530> and<00:04:40.770> that's<00:04:41.760> running

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
mains powered CFL and that's running

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.410 
mains powered CFL and that's running
perfectly<00:04:42.510> fine<00:04:42.750> from<00:04:43.260> the<00:04:43.410> inverter<00:04:44.360> also<00:04:45.360> if

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
perfectly fine from the inverter also if

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.010 
perfectly fine from the inverter also if
I<00:04:45.480> flip<00:04:45.720> the<00:04:45.870> switch<00:04:47.360> we<00:04:48.360> also<00:04:48.510> have<00:04:48.750> a<00:04:48.780> small

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
I flip the switch we also have a small

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.110 
I flip the switch we also have a small
14<00:04:49.950> inch<00:04:50.130> TV<00:04:50.610> in<00:04:50.700> here<00:04:52.580> which<00:04:53.580> doesn't<00:04:53.880> get<00:04:54.030> the

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
14 inch TV in here which doesn't get the

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.430 
14 inch TV in here which doesn't get the
best<00:04:54.300> reception<00:04:54.810> but<00:04:54.990> just<00:04:55.200> show<00:04:55.410> that

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
best reception but just show that

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.730 
best reception but just show that
running<00:04:56.990> essentially<00:04:57.990> I<00:04:58.020> can<00:04:58.050> run<00:04:58.320> anything<00:04:58.560> I

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
running essentially I can run anything I

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.290 
running essentially I can run anything I
want<00:04:58.980> off<00:04:59.160> of<00:04:59.190> that<00:04:59.490> up<00:04:59.730> to<00:04:59.880> 300<00:05:00.120> Watts

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
want off of that up to 300 Watts

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.760 
want off of that up to 300 Watts
eventually<00:05:03.300> we're<00:05:03.570> planning<00:05:04.020> on<00:05:04.230> putting<00:05:04.560> a

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
eventually we're planning on putting a

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.880 
eventually we're planning on putting a
much<00:05:05.010> bigger<00:05:05.340> inverter<00:05:05.790> in<00:05:06.030> this<00:05:06.210> space<00:05:06.480> here

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 
much bigger inverter in this space here

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:12.320 
much bigger inverter in this space here
probably<00:05:07.890> probably<00:05:08.480> 1,000<00:05:09.480> or<00:05:09.750> 2,000<00:05:10.530> watts

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
probably probably 1,000 or 2,000 watts

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.860 
probably probably 1,000 or 2,000 watts
just<00:05:12.810> to<00:05:12.870> get<00:05:12.990> the<00:05:13.080> most<00:05:13.230> out<00:05:13.410> of<00:05:13.470> that<00:05:13.530> battery

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
just to get the most out of that battery

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.000 
just to get the most out of that battery
and<00:05:16.040> eventually<00:05:17.040> we're<00:05:17.850> planning<00:05:18.390> on<00:05:18.570> putting

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010 
and eventually we're planning on putting

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.460 
and eventually we're planning on putting
a<00:05:20.240> hundred<00:05:21.240> watt<00:05:21.420> maybe<00:05:21.870> even<00:05:22.200> two<00:05:22.440> hundred

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
a hundred watt maybe even two hundred

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.620 
a hundred watt maybe even two hundred
Watts<00:05:23.040> with<00:05:23.460> the<00:05:23.580> panels<00:05:24.000> on<00:05:24.210> the<00:05:24.300> roof<00:05:24.420> of<00:05:24.540> the

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
Watts with the panels on the roof of the

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.150 
Watts with the panels on the roof of the
shed<00:05:25.610> and<00:05:26.610> pretty<00:05:27.480> much<00:05:27.690> that<00:05:27.960> means<00:05:28.230> that<00:05:29.010> any

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
shed and pretty much that means that any

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.660 
shed and pretty much that means that any
drills<00:05:29.670> or<00:05:30.800> you<00:05:31.800> know<00:05:31.860> any<00:05:32.160> kind<00:05:32.280> of<00:05:32.460> power

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:32.670 
drills or you know any kind of power

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:36.410 
drills or you know any kind of power
tools<00:05:32.970> will<00:05:33.300> run<00:05:33.480> off<00:05:33.630> it<00:05:33.840> fine<00:05:34.970> and<00:05:35.970> also<00:05:36.270> when

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:36.420 
tools will run off it fine and also when

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.890 
tools will run off it fine and also when
the<00:05:36.510> summer<00:05:36.720> does<00:05:36.990> get<00:05:37.260> here<00:05:37.790> be<00:05:38.790> able<00:05:39.030> to<00:05:39.240> get

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
the summer does get here be able to get

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.129 
the summer does get here be able to get
the<00:05:40.020> mower<00:05:40.200> out<00:05:40.320> on<00:05:40.590> the<00:05:40.680> grass

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:48.180 

also<00:05:44.250> my<00:05:45.250> dad<00:05:45.490> does<00:05:45.819> a<00:05:45.850> lot<00:05:46.060> of<00:05:46.240> planting<00:05:47.229> into

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
also my dad does a lot of planting into

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.040 
also my dad does a lot of planting into
the<00:05:48.280> greenhouse<00:05:48.490> over<00:05:48.910> there

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
the greenhouse over there

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.659 
the greenhouse over there
so<00:05:50.440> you<00:05:50.500> wants<00:05:50.650> to<00:05:50.710> get<00:05:50.830> I<00:05:51.160> think<00:05:51.430> it's<00:05:51.550> called

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
so you wants to get I think it's called

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:54.300 
so you wants to get I think it's called
an<00:05:51.789> incubator<00:05:52.259> which<00:05:53.259> uses<00:05:53.590> about<00:05:53.710> 50<00:05:54.099> watts

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
an incubator which uses about 50 watts

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.650 
an incubator which uses about 50 watts
of<00:05:54.580> power<00:05:54.970> to<00:05:55.330> heat<00:05:55.569> the<00:05:55.930> plants<00:05:57.180> so<00:05:58.180> for<00:05:58.449> that

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
of power to heat the plants so for that

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.140 
of power to heat the plants so for that
we'll<00:05:59.530> need<00:05:59.650> to<00:05:59.710> upgrade<00:06:00.190> the<00:06:00.460> inverter<00:06:00.759> and

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
we'll need to upgrade the inverter and

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.990 
we'll need to upgrade the inverter and
the<00:06:01.990> panel's<00:06:02.380> but<00:06:03.310> essentially<00:06:03.729> it<00:06:03.819> means

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
the panel's but essentially it means

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.820 
the panel's but essentially it means
that<00:06:04.180> in<00:06:04.270> the<00:06:04.419> shed<00:06:04.720> you<00:06:04.960> can<00:06:05.080> have<00:06:05.319> a<00:06:05.349> little

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 
that in the shed you can have a little

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.350 
that in the shed you can have a little
heat<00:06:06.610> for<00:06:07.539> its<00:06:07.660> plant<00:06:08.190> at<00:06:09.190> the<00:06:09.280> moment<00:06:09.729> I<00:06:09.970> am

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
heat for its plant at the moment I am

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.790 
heat for its plant at the moment I am
teaching<00:06:10.780> a<00:06:11.020> little<00:06:11.229> bit

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
teaching a little bit

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.990 
teaching a little bit
we<00:06:12.729> do<00:06:12.940> have<00:06:13.150> a<00:06:13.210> mains<00:06:13.930> powered<00:06:14.470> heater

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
we do have a mains powered heater

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.640 
we do have a mains powered heater
running<00:06:16.000> off<00:06:16.210> an<00:06:16.449> extension<00:06:17.050> cord<00:06:17.320> that's

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:17.650 
running off an extension cord that's

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.610 
running off an extension cord that's
running<00:06:17.949> up<00:06:18.070> into<00:06:18.310> the<00:06:18.400> house<00:06:19.470> but<00:06:20.470> that's

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.620 
running up into the house but that's

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.580 
running up into the house but that's
purely<00:06:20.979> because<00:06:21.099> at<00:06:21.580> the<00:06:21.699> moment<00:06:22.199> this<00:06:23.199> system

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590 
purely because at the moment this system

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.610 
purely because at the moment this system
puts<00:06:23.860> out<00:06:24.009> 300<00:06:24.610> watts<00:06:24.789> of<00:06:24.940> mains<00:06:25.180> power<00:06:25.530> but<00:06:26.530> at

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:26.620 
puts out 300 watts of mains power but at

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.860 
puts out 300 watts of mains power but at
heater<00:06:26.830> needs<00:06:27.130> about<00:06:28.050> 1,600<00:06:30.479> but<00:06:31.479> once<00:06:31.630> we<00:06:31.750> do

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:31.870 
heater needs about 1,600 but once we do

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.300 
heater needs about 1,600 but once we do
have<00:06:32.020> an<00:06:32.139> inverter<00:06:32.410> to<00:06:32.560> suit<00:06:32.830> we<00:06:33.039> could

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
have an inverter to suit we could

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.570 
have an inverter to suit we could
potentially<00:06:33.940> run<00:06:34.120> a<00:06:34.150> heater<00:06:34.360> in<00:06:34.570> here<00:06:35.580> plus

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:36.580 
potentially run a heater in here plus

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.850 
potentially run a heater in here plus
the<00:06:36.729> fact<00:06:36.909> at<00:06:37.120> the<00:06:37.240> moment<00:06:37.270> it<00:06:37.750> is<00:06:37.780> the<00:06:37.930> middle

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:38.860 
the fact at the moment it is the middle

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:43.649 
the fact at the moment it is the middle
of<00:06:38.949> February<00:06:39.099> and<00:06:39.639> about<00:06:40.240> minus<00:06:40.659> 3<00:06:42.659> anyways

00:06:43.649 --> 00:06:43.659 
of February and about minus 3 anyways

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:45.809 
of February and about minus 3 anyways
just<00:06:43.900> to<00:06:44.409> give<00:06:44.530> you<00:06:44.620> one<00:06:44.979> last<00:06:45.130> recap<00:06:45.580> this<00:06:45.759> is

00:06:45.809 --> 00:06:45.819 
just to give you one last recap this is

00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:48.990 
just to give you one last recap this is
the<00:06:46.120> solar<00:06:46.330> setup<00:06:46.599> I've<00:06:46.810> done<00:06:47.050> I<00:06:47.849> have<00:06:48.849> my

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:49.000 
the solar setup I've done I have my

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.060 
the solar setup I've done I have my
solar<00:06:49.270> power<00:06:49.539> coming<00:06:50.169> in<00:06:50.289> here<00:06:51.150> it<00:06:52.150> goes<00:06:52.330> down

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:53.070 
solar power coming in here it goes down

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:56.219 
solar power coming in here it goes down
into<00:06:54.070> my<00:06:54.370> charge<00:06:54.639> controller<00:06:55.150> which<00:06:55.990> at<00:06:56.139> the

00:06:56.219 --> 00:06:56.229 
into my charge controller which at the

00:06:56.229 --> 00:07:00.029 
into my charge controller which at the
moment<00:06:56.259> is<00:06:56.650> just<00:06:57.009> over<00:06:57.250> halfway<00:06:57.430> charged<00:06:59.039> goes

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:00.039 
moment is just over halfway charged goes

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:05.909 
moment is just over halfway charged goes
into<00:07:00.310> the<00:07:00.400> battery<00:07:00.759> here<00:07:04.259> where<00:07:05.259> is<00:07:05.380> it<00:07:05.530> Allawi

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:05.919 
into the battery here where is it Allawi

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:07.950 
into the battery here where is it Allawi
up<00:07:06.039> which<00:07:06.460> can<00:07:06.759> come<00:07:06.909> up<00:07:07.030> into<00:07:07.210> my<00:07:07.330> inverter<00:07:07.690> to

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:07.960 
up which can come up into my inverter to

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.040 
up which can come up into my inverter to
give<00:07:08.080> me<00:07:08.229> mains<00:07:08.830> power<00:07:09.219> which<00:07:10.060> is<00:07:10.240> earthed<00:07:10.539> for

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.050 
give me mains power which is earthed for

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:15.029 
give me mains power which is earthed for
safety<00:07:11.550> or<00:07:12.990> providing<00:07:13.990> everything<00:07:14.380> is<00:07:14.680> OK

00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:15.039 
safety or providing everything is OK

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:18.180 
safety or providing everything is OK
your<00:07:15.520> board<00:07:15.909> for<00:07:16.150> lighting<00:07:16.630> out<00:07:17.080> of<00:07:17.740> here

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:18.190 
your board for lighting out of here

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:22.290 
your board for lighting out of here
I<00:07:18.219> have<00:07:18.909> 12<00:07:19.240> volts<00:07:19.630> which<00:07:20.620> comes<00:07:20.889> up<00:07:21.300> along

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:22.300 
I have 12 volts which comes up along

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.249 
I have 12 volts which comes up along
these<00:07:22.449> wires<00:07:22.690> to<00:07:23.500> the<00:07:23.620> switch<00:07:23.830> and<00:07:25.110> then<00:07:26.110> to

00:07:26.249 --> 00:07:26.259 
these wires to the switch and then to

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:31.529 
these wires to the switch and then to
the<00:07:26.349> light<00:07:27.690> so<00:07:28.690> yeah<00:07:28.900> 12<00:07:29.650> volt<00:07:29.860> lighting<00:07:30.539> plus

00:07:31.529 --> 00:07:31.539 
the light so yeah 12 volt lighting plus

00:07:31.539 --> 00:07:34.170 
the light so yeah 12 volt lighting plus
at<00:07:31.900> the<00:07:32.169> moment<00:07:32.560> 300<00:07:33.310> watts<00:07:33.520> of<00:07:33.639> mains<00:07:33.880> power

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:34.180 
at the moment 300 watts of mains power

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.860 
at the moment 300 watts of mains power
which<00:07:35.080> as<00:07:35.349> you<00:07:35.500> can<00:07:35.530> see<00:07:36.330> is<00:07:37.330> enough<00:07:37.750> for

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:37.870 
which as you can see is enough for

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:42.480 
which as you can see is enough for
running<00:07:38.080> a<00:07:38.139> TV<00:07:38.699> lights<00:07:39.900> charges<00:07:41.250> and<00:07:42.250> in<00:07:42.400> the

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:42.490 
running a TV lights charges and in the

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:45.120 
running a TV lights charges and in the
future<00:07:42.669> I<00:07:42.820> can<00:07:43.060> upgrade<00:07:43.180> a<00:07:43.389> lot<00:07:43.630> so<00:07:44.349> thanks<00:07:45.039> for

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:45.130 
future I can upgrade a lot so thanks for

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:47.430 
future I can upgrade a lot so thanks for
watching
