00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
just going to left-click and that will

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.440 
just going to left-click and that will
pretty<00:02:54.980> much<00:02:55.130> have<00:02:55.459> this<00:02:55.790> screen<00:02:56.120> and<00:02:56.209> stick

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
pretty much have this screen and stick

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.229 
pretty much have this screen and stick
there<00:02:56.890> so<00:02:57.890> next<00:02:58.070> we're<00:02:58.520> going<00:02:58.640> to<00:02:58.760> be<00:02:58.880> setting

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
there so next we're going to be setting

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.960 
there so next we're going to be setting
up<00:02:59.330> boundaries<00:03:00.160> and<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.310> boundaries<00:03:01.730> is

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
up boundaries and the boundaries is

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.590 
up boundaries and the boundaries is
basically<00:03:02.450> going<00:03:03.110> to<00:03:03.290> be<00:03:03.410> a<00:03:03.440> giant<00:03:03.860> box<00:03:04.040> in<00:03:04.600> it

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
basically going to be a giant box in it

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.060 
basically going to be a giant box in it
for<00:03:05.720> inside<00:03:05.959> the<00:03:06.110> box<00:03:06.320> I<00:03:06.530> means<00:03:06.709> you're<00:03:06.860> in<00:03:06.950> the

makes
so<00:03:16.970> what<00:03:17.540> we're<00:03:17.720> going<00:03:17.750> to<00:03:17.900> do<00:03:18.050> is<00:03:18.290> we're<00:03:18.500> going

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.259 
so what we're going to do is we're going
to<00:03:18.709> find<00:03:18.890> the<00:03:19.010> highest<00:03:19.340> possible<00:03:20.000> point

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
to find the highest possible point

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.259 
to find the highest possible point
inside<00:03:21.110> the<00:03:21.350> theater<00:03:21.620> which<00:03:22.340> will<00:03:22.550> be<00:03:22.700> over

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
inside the theater which will be over

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.210 
inside the theater which will be over
here<00:03:26.140> when<00:03:27.140> I<00:03:27.170> left<00:03:27.230> click<00:03:27.560> once<00:03:27.860> and<00:03:28.070> you'll

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
here when I left click once and you'll

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.990 
here when I left click once and you'll
start<00:03:28.430> making<00:03:28.760> a<00:03:28.850> box<00:03:30.519> so<00:03:31.519> I'm<00:03:31.580> going<00:03:31.730> to<00:03:31.820> find

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
start making a box so I'm going to find

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.699 
start making a box so I'm going to find
the<00:03:32.120> lowest<00:03:32.330> point<00:03:32.720> in<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:32.900> theater<00:03:33.320> and<00:03:35.709> I'm

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
the lowest point in the theater and I'm

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.780 
the lowest point in the theater and I'm
just<00:03:36.890> gonna<00:03:37.010> look<00:03:37.310> like<00:03:37.550> once<00:03:37.880> more<00:03:38.180> there<00:03:39.790> as

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
just gonna look like once more there as

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.030 
just gonna look like once more there as
you<00:03:41.030> can<00:03:41.150> see<00:03:41.360> I'm<00:03:41.840> pretty<00:03:42.410> much<00:03:42.590> in<00:03:42.799> the<00:03:42.890> box

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
you can see I'm pretty much in the box

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:49.020 
you can see I'm pretty much in the box
anywhere<00:03:43.940> I<00:03:43.970> go<00:03:44.180> around<00:03:44.480> the<00:03:44.600> theater

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.190 

so<00:03:50.620> how<00:03:51.620> I<00:03:52.010> would<00:03:52.580> be<00:03:52.610> able<00:03:52.760> to<00:03:53.060> see<00:03:53.750> the<00:03:53.959> screen

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
so how I would be able to see the screen

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.339 
so how I would be able to see the screen
correctly<00:03:54.560> and<00:03:55.840> other<00:03:56.840> people<00:03:57.140> will<00:03:57.260> hear

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:57.349 
correctly and other people will hear

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:00.640 
correctly and other people will hear
noise<00:03:58.510> I'm<00:03:59.510> the<00:03:59.660> only<00:03:59.780> exception<00:04:00.290> if<00:04:00.410> you're

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
noise I'm the only exception if you're

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.890 
noise I'm the only exception if you're
to<00:04:00.920> noclip<00:04:01.640> up<00:04:01.819> there<00:04:02.030> since<00:04:02.360> it's<00:04:02.600> outside

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
to noclip up there since it's outside

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.220 
to noclip up there since it's outside
the<00:04:03.080> box<00:04:03.290> but<00:04:04.120> under<00:04:05.120> normal<00:04:05.239> circumstances

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
the box but under normal circumstances

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.070 
the box but under normal circumstances
that's<00:04:06.470> not<00:04:06.800> likely<00:04:07.010> to<00:04:07.220> happen<00:04:07.930> now<00:04:08.930> if

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
that's not likely to happen now if

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.940 
that's not likely to happen now if
anytime<00:04:09.319> you're<00:04:09.770> unhappy<00:04:10.190> with<00:04:11.620> the<00:04:12.620> setup

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
anytime you're unhappy with the setup

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.740 
anytime you're unhappy with the setup
that<00:04:13.069> you've<00:04:13.370> had<00:04:13.580> you<00:04:14.209> can<00:04:14.330> just<00:04:14.540> right<00:04:14.720> click

that you've had you can just right click

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.710 
that you've had you can just right click
and<00:04:15.220> you'll<00:04:16.220> be<00:04:16.489> able<00:04:16.609> to<00:04:16.940> set<00:04:17.180> up<00:04:17.209> everything

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
and you'll be able to set up everything

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.900 
and you'll be able to set up everything

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
and just have to repeat the process so

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.260

there and if I put it up there you'll
notice<00:04:29.960> a<00:04:30.200> problem<00:04:30.380> because<00:04:31.010> now<00:04:33.310> that<00:04:34.310> I<00:04:34.340> have

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
notice a problem because now that I have

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.210 
notice a problem because now that I have
the<00:04:34.639> roof<00:04:34.820> covered<00:04:35.300> if<00:04:36.260> anyone<00:04:36.650> were<00:04:36.860> to<00:04:36.919> walk

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
the roof covered if anyone were to walk

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.159 
the roof covered if anyone were to walk
down<00:04:37.550> here<00:04:37.580> they<00:04:38.210> would<00:04:38.360> immediately<00:04:38.630> stop

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
down here they would immediately stop

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:41.500 
down here they would immediately stop
seeing<00:04:39.470> the<00:04:39.860> theater<00:04:40.130> screen<00:04:40.430> which<00:04:41.120> is<00:04:41.300> bad

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
seeing the theater screen which is bad

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.900 
seeing the theater screen which is bad
because<00:04:41.810> I'm<00:04:42.350> technically<00:04:43.340> in<00:04:43.520> the<00:04:43.550> theater

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
because I'm technically in the theater

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.320 
because I'm technically in the theater
but<00:04:44.270> the<00:04:44.479> script<00:04:44.720> is<00:04:44.840> don't<00:04:45.050> know<00:04:45.110> that<00:04:46.240> so<00:04:47.240> you

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
but the script is don't know that so you

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.990 
but the script is don't know that so you
just<00:04:47.510> want<00:04:47.840> to<00:04:47.870> make<00:04:48.590> sure<00:04:48.620> that<00:04:49.250> you've<00:04:49.490> got<00:04:49.760> a

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
correct boundaries points for the

00:04:52.970 --> 00:05:04.320 
correct boundaries points for the
boundaries<00:04:58.210> this<00:04:59.210> would<00:04:59.479> be<00:04:59.600> good

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.749 

so<00:05:05.330> once<00:05:05.479> everything's<00:05:05.810> been<00:05:05.930> set<00:05:06.289> up<00:05:06.550> if<00:05:07.550> you
