 they are super good i am gar on the day of 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.589
 Today I 'm going to show you two ideas for 

00:00:04.419 --> 00:00:07.569
 make ice pops in this 

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:10.030
 spring-summer they are super 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:12.099
 refreshing and very rich well rattle 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.230
 I scared a lot and if video environments 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:15.879
 to know how it's done we'll start with 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.820
 some pineapple lollipops in chile if you're 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:20.890
 you're going to need two cups of average pineapple 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.230
 cup of water one teaspoon of sugar 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.810
 brunette a teaspoon of chili powder 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.680
 and a teaspoon of chia 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:32.070
 first liquefies the ingredients the pineapple 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.030
 Water 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.030
 the sugar 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.830
 and chili powder 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.590
 when this liquefied add the chÃ­a I 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.180
 add because I like to feel the 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.809
 texture you can liquefy the from the 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.829
 principle then add that mixture in 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.829
 the molds for pallets 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.190
 freezing approximately for three 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.550
 hours and is really ready is super 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.550
 delicious 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.219
 the second option is one more offer 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.100
 stickers and you're going to need a cup 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:24.310
 of yogurt equal taste and strawberries to taste 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.719
 also place the fruit in the molds 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.719
 for pallets in this way 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:36.470
 and then add the yogurt and do the same 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.470
 with all the mold 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.960
 frozen for three hours 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.609
 and it stays this way is super 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.609
