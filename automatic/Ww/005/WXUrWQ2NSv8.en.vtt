kind of burnt looking under there I

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.320 
kind of burnt looking under there I
think<00:01:15.110> it<00:01:15.229> came<00:01:15.350> out<00:01:15.470> quite<00:01:15.530> well<00:01:15.740> so<00:01:16.180> there<00:01:17.180> is

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
think it came out quite well so there is

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.850 
think it came out quite well so there is
there<00:01:17.570> she<00:01:17.720> is<00:01:17.750> down<00:01:18.200> the<00:01:18.290> barrel<00:01:18.500> of<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:18.680> guns

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.210 
there she is down the barrel of the guns
there<00:01:19.509> so<00:01:20.509> I'm<00:01:20.990> pretty<00:01:21.320> happy<00:01:21.439> with<00:01:21.740> that<00:01:21.920> it's

that's the first one second maiden

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.170 
that's the first one second maiden
weapon<00:01:28.159> that<00:01:28.220> you<00:01:28.310> haven't<00:01:28.520> seen<00:01:28.670> a<00:01:28.700> tall<00:01:28.939> is

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
weapon that you haven't seen a tall is

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.060 
weapon that you haven't seen a tall is
the<00:01:29.509> gapping<00:01:30.080> blaster<00:01:31.240> so<00:01:32.240> this<00:01:33.200> is<00:01:33.229> her<00:01:33.590> this

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
the gapping blaster so this is her this

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.760 
the gapping blaster so this is her this
is<00:01:34.220> it<00:01:34.570> again<00:01:35.570> going<00:01:35.840> with<00:01:36.049> the<00:01:36.140> hazard<00:01:36.500> stripe

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
is it again going with the hazard stripe

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.969 
is it again going with the hazard stripe
theme<00:01:37.210> I<00:01:38.229> figured<00:01:39.229> this<00:01:39.320> was<00:01:39.500> kind<00:01:39.680> of<00:01:39.770> some

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
theme I figured this was kind of some

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:41.590 
theme I figured this was kind of some
sort<00:01:40.159> of<00:01:40.189> weapon<00:01:40.400> pack<00:01:40.790> that<00:01:41.060> this<00:01:41.240> would<00:01:41.390> come

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
sort of weapon pack that this would come

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.870 
sort of weapon pack that this would come
off<00:01:41.780> and<00:01:42.079> then<00:01:42.650> and<00:01:42.920> you<00:01:43.250> want<00:01:43.430> to<00:01:43.490> get<00:01:43.640> loaded

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
off and then and you want to get loaded

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.300 
off and then and you want to get loaded
on<00:01:44.259> so<00:01:45.259> I've<00:01:45.560> gone<00:01:45.650> for<00:01:45.860> the<00:01:45.920> hazard<00:01:46.159> stripes

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
lost a couple down the plughole when I

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.870 
lost a couple down the plughole when I
was<00:03:19.880> washing<00:03:20.030> them<00:03:20.329> in<00:03:20.450> the<00:03:20.540> bath<00:03:20.799> so<00:03:21.880> what

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
was washing them in the bath so what

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.550 
was washing them in the bath so what
have<00:03:22.970> we<00:03:23.000> got<00:03:23.180> there<00:03:23.360> five<00:03:23.660> missiles<00:03:24.079> missing

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
have we got there five missiles missing

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.710 
have we got there five missiles missing
that<00:03:24.769> have<00:03:24.860> been<00:03:24.980> fired<00:03:25.340> fired<00:03:26.239> down<00:03:26.600> the

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
that have been fired fired down the

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.430 
that have been fired fired down the
plughole<00:03:27.220> so<00:03:28.690> so<00:03:29.690> that's<00:03:29.900> that<00:03:30.049> that's<00:03:30.260> why

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
plughole so so that's that that's why

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.900 
plughole so so that's that that's why
they're<00:03:30.620> missing<00:03:30.950> but<00:03:31.310> I<00:03:31.640> think<00:03:31.790> it<00:03:31.880> looks

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
they're missing but I think it looks

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.060 
they're missing but I think it looks
okay<00:03:32.120> I<00:03:32.720> think<00:03:32.870> it<00:03:32.930> looks<00:03:33.049> really<00:03:33.079> good<00:03:33.320> and

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
okay I think it looks really good and

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.569 
okay I think it looks really good and
this<00:03:34.850> is<00:03:35.000> kind<00:03:35.180> of<00:03:35.269> a<00:03:35.590> bit<00:03:36.590> not<00:03:37.040> not<00:03:37.250> as<00:03:37.340> bright

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
this is kind of a bit not not as bright

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.069 
this is kind of a bit not not as bright
as<00:03:37.820> their<00:03:38.030> the<00:03:38.239> other<00:03:38.360> weapon<00:03:38.690> arms<00:03:38.900> because

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
as their the other weapon arms because

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:40.420 
as their the other weapon arms because
you<00:03:39.260> know<00:03:39.380> the<00:03:39.500> missiles<00:03:39.769> are<00:03:39.860> coming<00:03:40.010> out<00:03:40.280> and

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
you know the missiles are coming out and

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.400 
you know the missiles are coming out and
kind<00:03:40.670> of<00:03:40.760> burning<00:03:41.450> the<00:03:41.630> back<00:03:41.840> plate<00:03:42.110> of<00:03:42.260> this

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
kind of burning the back plate of this

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.990 
kind of burning the back plate of this
this<00:03:42.650> hazard<00:03:42.980> stripe<00:03:43.190> area<00:03:43.519> so<00:03:43.760> I<00:03:43.790> think<00:03:43.880> that

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
this hazard stripe area so I think that

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.740 
this hazard stripe area so I think that
was<00:03:44.180> pretty<00:03:44.329> cool<00:03:45.100> um<00:03:46.269> what<00:03:47.269> else<00:03:47.390> haven't<00:03:47.600> you
