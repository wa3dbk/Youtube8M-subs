00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
ready to be used it's about a centimeter

ready to be used it's about a centimeter
in<00:04:03.400> thickness<00:04:04.109> I'm<00:04:05.109> going<00:04:05.290> to<00:04:05.349> put<00:04:05.500> a<00:04:05.530> towel

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
in thickness I'm going to put a towel

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.410 
in thickness I'm going to put a towel
over<00:04:05.950> my<00:04:06.220> dough<00:04:06.280> so<00:04:06.730> it<00:04:06.819> doesn't<00:04:07.090> dry<00:04:07.209> it<00:04:07.329> out

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
over my dough so it doesn't dry it out

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.690 
over my dough so it doesn't dry it out
and<00:04:07.810> the<00:04:08.170> meantime<00:04:08.409> I'm<00:04:09.010> going<00:04:09.189> to<00:04:09.280> be<00:04:09.370> heating

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
and the meantime I'm going to be heating

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.369 
and the meantime I'm going to be heating
up<00:04:09.849> my<00:04:10.000> oil<00:04:10.030> now<00:04:10.420> our<00:04:10.629> oil<00:04:10.659> should<00:04:11.079> take<00:04:11.260> about

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:11.379 
up my oil now our oil should take about

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:13.349 
up my oil now our oil should take about
five<00:04:11.829> minutes<00:04:11.859> to<00:04:12.400> heat<00:04:12.549> up<00:04:12.579> and<00:04:13.030> we're<00:04:13.239> going

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:13.359 
five minutes to heat up and we're going

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:16.439 
five minutes to heat up and we're going
to<00:04:13.390> be<00:04:13.480> heating<00:04:13.840> it<00:04:13.930> on<00:04:14.170> a<00:04:14.349> medium<00:04:14.739> heat<00:04:15.329> or<00:04:16.329> if

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:16.449 
to be heating it on a medium heat or if

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:18.449 
to be heating it on a medium heat or if
you<00:04:16.539> have<00:04:16.720> an<00:04:16.840> electronic<00:04:17.260> stove<00:04:17.620> then<00:04:18.220> put

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
you have an electronic stove then put

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.969 
you have an electronic stove then put
your<00:04:18.609> heat<00:04:18.789> on<00:04:18.940> a<00:04:19.000> number<00:04:19.359> for<00:04:19.660> maybe<00:04:20.560> a<00:04:20.680> number

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
your heat on a number for maybe a number

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:22.590 
your heat on a number for maybe a number
five<00:04:21.250> but<00:04:21.519> I<00:04:21.549> really<00:04:21.880> would<00:04:22.030> suggest<00:04:22.210> a<00:04:22.479> number

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
five but I really would suggest a number

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.450 
five but I really would suggest a number
four<00:04:22.930> now<00:04:23.320> the<00:04:23.380> reason<00:04:23.770> being<00:04:23.919> is<00:04:24.100> you've<00:04:24.310> got

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
four now the reason being is you've got

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.900 
four now the reason being is you've got
a<00:04:24.490> deep<00:04:24.789> fry<00:04:25.120> this<00:04:25.780> dough<00:04:26.110> and<00:04:26.470> if<00:04:27.160> you<00:04:27.280> deep

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
a deep fry this dough and if you deep

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.120 
a deep fry this dough and if you deep
fry<00:04:28.120> it<00:04:28.180> on<00:04:28.419> a<00:04:28.449> very<00:04:28.630> high<00:04:28.930> heat<00:04:28.960> it<00:04:29.500> won't<00:04:29.770> get

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
fry it on a very high heat it won't get

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.310 
fry it on a very high heat it won't get
cooked<00:04:30.340> on<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:30.639> inside<00:04:31.030> so<00:04:31.750> you<00:04:31.780> really

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
cooked on the inside so you really

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.189 
cooked on the inside so you really
should<00:04:32.560> do<00:04:32.830> it<00:04:32.949> on<00:04:33.130> a<00:04:33.160> lower<00:04:33.520> heat<00:04:33.870> so<00:04:34.870> that<00:04:34.900> it

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
should do it on a lower heat so that it

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:37.589 
should do it on a lower heat so that it
takes<00:04:35.440> a<00:04:35.560> little<00:04:35.680> bit<00:04:35.860> longer<00:04:36.039> but<00:04:36.580> it'll<00:04:37.479> be

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:37.599 
takes a little bit longer but it'll be

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:40.080 
takes a little bit longer but it'll be
cooked<00:04:37.840> properly<00:04:38.050> on<00:04:38.349> the<00:04:38.530> inside<00:04:38.979> now<00:04:39.759> it

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090

00:05:13.989 --> 00:05:19.690 
cake so now I need to be taking my cook
as<00:05:14.169> is<00:05:14.379> I<00:05:15.300> slide<00:05:16.300> it<00:05:16.899> into<00:05:17.110> the<00:05:17.649> oil

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700 
as is I slide it into the oil

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.060 
as is I slide it into the oil
and<00:05:20.480> I'm<00:05:20.900> going<00:05:21.170> to<00:05:21.260> deep<00:05:21.500> fry<00:05:21.530> it<00:05:21.800> for

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
and I'm going to deep fry it for

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.610 
and I'm going to deep fry it for
approximately<00:05:23.030> three<00:05:23.960> to<00:05:24.320> three-and-a-half

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
approximately three to three-and-a-half

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:30.610 
approximately three to three-and-a-half
minutes<00:05:25.900> I'm<00:05:26.900> going<00:05:27.140> to<00:05:27.230> do<00:05:27.320> two<00:05:27.530> at<00:05:27.620> a<00:05:27.710> time

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.560 

now<00:05:31.620> while<00:05:31.830> that's<00:05:32.070> frying<00:05:32.280> with<00:05:33.120> your<00:05:33.300> spoon

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
now while that's frying with your spoon

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.010 
now while that's frying with your spoon
pour<00:05:34.170> some<00:05:34.500> oil<00:05:34.710> onto<00:05:35.220> the<00:05:35.730> thick<00:05:36.690> cook<00:05:36.870> as

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
pour some oil onto the thick cook as

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.410 
pour some oil onto the thick cook as
well<00:05:37.050> on<00:05:37.470> the<00:05:37.650> top<00:05:37.890> so<00:05:38.760> that<00:05:38.940> it<00:05:39.030> starts

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:39.420 
well on the top so that it starts

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.810 
well on the top so that it starts
puffing<00:05:39.810> on<00:05:40.260> the<00:05:40.560> top<00:05:40.770> as<00:05:40.950> well<00:05:41.100> so<00:05:41.340> once<00:05:41.610> it's

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
puffing on the top as well so once it's

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.210 
puffing on the top as well so once it's
perfect<00:05:42.330> you<00:05:42.780> will<00:05:43.020> get<00:05:43.350> a<00:05:43.440> data<00:05:43.620> slightly

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
perfect you will get a data slightly

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.220 
perfect you will get a data slightly
hollow<00:05:44.490> on<00:05:44.700> the<00:05:44.730> inside<00:05:44.850> and<00:05:45.720> that<00:05:45.840> will<00:05:45.960> allow

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.230 
hollow on the inside and that will allow

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.060 
hollow on the inside and that will allow
you<00:05:46.290> to<00:05:46.710> put<00:05:47.310> some<00:05:47.640> filling<00:05:48.210> inside<00:05:49.020> your<00:05:49.350> pit
