it<00:02:03.659> also<00:02:03.810> keeps<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.409> tip<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.040> brush<00:02:05.250> nice

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
it also keeps the tip of the brush nice

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.770 
it also keeps the tip of the brush nice
and<00:02:06.170> pointy<00:02:06.710> if<00:02:06.920> you<00:02:07.310> just<00:02:07.520> sweep<00:02:08.180> it<00:02:08.330> back<00:02:08.540> and

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
and pointy if you just sweep it back and

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.170 
and pointy if you just sweep it back and
forth<00:02:08.960> like<00:02:09.170> this<00:02:09.229> it<00:02:09.590> will<00:02:09.740> tend<00:02:10.040> to<00:02:10.160> bend<00:02:10.940> the

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
forth like this it will tend to bend the

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.860 
forth like this it will tend to bend the
bristles<00:02:11.660> so<00:02:11.900> you<00:02:12.020> can<00:02:12.230> see<00:02:12.470> but<00:02:13.040> if<00:02:13.310> you<00:02:13.870> wipe

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
bristles so you can see but if you wipe

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.770 
bristles so you can see but if you wipe
it<00:02:15.110> in<00:02:15.260> a<00:02:15.350> circular<00:02:16.450> motion<00:02:17.450> as<00:02:17.600> you're

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
it in a circular motion as you're

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.960 
it in a circular motion as you're
pulling<00:02:18.620> it<00:02:18.740> away<00:02:18.950> from<00:02:19.190> you<00:02:19.370> it<00:02:19.550> will<00:02:19.760> keep

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
pulling it away from you it will keep

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.390 
pulling it away from you it will keep
the<00:02:20.180> bristles<00:02:20.570> nice<00:02:20.900> and<00:02:21.560> straight<00:02:22.070> and<00:02:22.280> then

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
the bristles nice and straight and then

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.880 
the bristles nice and straight and then
you<00:02:22.580> just<00:02:22.790> store<00:02:23.060> it<00:02:23.180> back<00:02:23.360> into<00:02:23.600> your<00:02:23.900> storing

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
you just store it back into your storing

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.970 
you just store it back into your storing
container<00:02:25.310> sometimes<00:02:26.590> you<00:02:27.590> will<00:02:27.740> have<00:02:27.920> a

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
container sometimes you will have a

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.630 
container sometimes you will have a
little<00:02:28.370> bit<00:02:28.490> of<00:02:28.580> paint<00:02:29.000> on<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:30.230> bristles<00:02:30.830> like

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
little bit of paint on the bristles like

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.340 
little bit of paint on the bristles like
this<00:02:31.910> one<00:02:32.090> here<00:02:32.360> which<00:02:32.510> is<00:02:32.630> from<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:33.050> design

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
this one here which is from the design

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.840 
this one here which is from the design
that<00:02:33.500> I<00:02:33.530> did<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:33.860> other<00:02:33.980> day<00:02:34.160> and<00:02:34.280> I<00:02:34.400> will<00:02:34.670> have

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
that I did the other day and I will have

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.420 
that I did the other day and I will have
a<00:02:35.090> tutorial<00:02:35.870> for<00:02:36.590> this<00:02:36.740> so<00:02:36.920> you<00:02:37.040> guys<00:02:37.130> have<00:02:37.400> to

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
a tutorial for this so you guys have to

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.420 
a tutorial for this so you guys have to
just<00:02:37.760> keep<00:02:37.970> watching<00:02:38.450> if<00:02:38.960> it's<00:02:39.800> stained<00:02:40.190> like

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
just keep watching if it's stained like

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.940 
just keep watching if it's stained like
this<00:02:40.640> I<00:02:40.790> will<00:02:41.180> dip<00:02:41.690> my<00:02:41.900> brush<00:02:42.140> into<00:02:42.470> a<00:02:42.650> little

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
this I will dip my brush into a little

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.230 
this I will dip my brush into a little
bit<00:02:43.070> of<00:02:43.420> pure<00:02:44.420> 100%<00:02:45.020> pure<00:02:45.470> acetone<00:02:45.890> and<00:02:46.340> just

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
bit of pure 100% pure acetone and just

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
bit of pure 100% pure acetone and just
very<00:02:47.420> gently<00:02:48.790> dip<00:02:49.790> it<00:02:49.940> in<00:02:50.060> there<00:02:50.300> and<00:02:50.510> then<00:02:51.080> you

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
very gently dip it in there and then you

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.670 
very gently dip it in there and then you
can<00:02:51.880> wipe<00:02:52.880> your<00:02:53.090> brush<00:02:53.360> if<00:02:53.840> it's<00:02:54.140> a<00:02:54.200> flat<00:02:54.440> brush

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
can wipe your brush if it's a flat brush

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.060 
can wipe your brush if it's a flat brush
just<00:02:55.010> kind<00:02:55.340> of<00:02:55.460> wipe<00:02:55.610> it<00:02:56.080> on<00:02:57.080> one<00:02:57.290> side<00:02:57.590> flat

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
just kind of wipe it on one side flat

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.340 
just kind of wipe it on one side flat
and<00:02:58.370> then<00:02:58.670> on<00:02:58.850> the<00:02:59.000> other<00:02:59.150> side<00:02:59.480> and<00:02:59.780> this<00:03:00.170> will

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
and then on the other side and this will

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.180 
and then on the other side and this will
eventually<00:03:00.670> get<00:03:01.670> rid<00:03:01.910> of<00:03:02.060> all<00:03:02.600> of<00:03:03.020> the<00:03:03.230> color

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
eventually get rid of all of the color

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.990 
eventually get rid of all of the color
and<00:03:04.520> the<00:03:04.670> bristles<00:03:04.910> and<00:03:05.450> the<00:03:06.320> same<00:03:06.530> thing<00:03:06.830> for

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
and the bristles and the same thing for

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.580 
and the bristles and the same thing for
the<00:03:08.000> striping<00:03:08.450> brushes<00:03:08.840> these<00:03:09.020> tend<00:03:09.320> to<00:03:09.470> get

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
the striping brushes these tend to get

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.640 
the striping brushes these tend to get
really<00:03:09.830> really<00:03:10.489> dirty<00:03:10.730> so<00:03:10.910> then<00:03:11.390> just<00:03:11.780> dip<00:03:12.500> it

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
really really dirty so then just dip it

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.229 
really really dirty so then just dip it
into<00:03:12.800> the<00:03:13.420> acetone<00:03:14.420> and<00:03:14.600> then<00:03:15.790> dip<00:03:16.790> it<00:03:16.820> into<00:03:17.090> a

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
into the acetone and then dip it into a

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:18.880 
into the acetone and then dip it into a
little<00:03:17.300> bit<00:03:17.630> of<00:03:17.660> water<00:03:17.930> just<00:03:18.080> to<00:03:18.410> wash<00:03:18.590> the

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
little bit of water just to wash the

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.460 
little bit of water just to wash the
acetone<00:03:19.400> out<00:03:19.790> and<00:03:20.120> then<00:03:20.480> again<00:03:20.930> you're<00:03:21.260> going

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
acetone out and then again you're going

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.729 
acetone out and then again you're going
to<00:03:21.560> rotate<00:03:22.130> your<00:03:22.340> brush<00:03:23.260> sometimes<00:03:24.260> even

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
to rotate your brush sometimes even

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.590 
to rotate your brush sometimes even
pressing<00:03:25.310> down<00:03:25.760> on<00:03:25.790> the<00:03:25.970> brush<00:03:26.239> that<00:03:26.450> will

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
pressing down on the brush that will

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.229 
pressing down on the brush that will
also<00:03:26.750> take<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:27.550> colors<00:03:28.550> out<00:03:28.760> of<00:03:28.820> the<00:03:29.030> brush

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
also take the colors out of the brush

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.040 
also take the colors out of the brush
but<00:03:29.630> that's<00:03:30.050> basically<00:03:30.320> all<00:03:30.800> I<00:03:30.950> do<00:03:31.160> how<00:03:31.640> I

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
but that's basically all I do how I

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.650 
but that's basically all I do how I
clean<00:03:33.050> my<00:03:33.080> nail<00:03:33.560> or<00:03:33.709> brushes<00:03:34.220> it<00:03:35.030> is<00:03:35.360> super

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
clean my nail or brushes it is super

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.990 
clean my nail or brushes it is super
easy<00:03:35.840> and<00:03:36.290> I've<00:03:36.800> had<00:03:37.100> these<00:03:37.280> brushes<00:03:37.730> for

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
easy and I've had these brushes for

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.750 
easy and I've had these brushes for
years<00:03:38.330> and<00:03:38.570> they<00:03:38.810> have<00:03:39.050> not<00:03:39.320> yet<00:03:39.980> frayed<00:03:40.430> or

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
years and they have not yet frayed or

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.910 
years and they have not yet frayed or
gotten<00:03:41.239> damaged<00:03:41.750> and<00:03:42.170> I<00:03:42.410> think<00:03:42.680> it's<00:03:42.830> just

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
gotten damaged and I think it's just

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.130 
gotten damaged and I think it's just
because<00:03:43.310> I<00:03:43.340> cleaned<00:03:43.700> them<00:03:43.820> right<00:03:44.239> away<00:03:44.480> as<00:03:44.720> I

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
because I cleaned them right away as I

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.229 
because I cleaned them right away as I
go<00:03:45.380> along<00:03:45.530> and<00:03:45.709> I<00:03:46.010> do<00:03:46.070> my<00:03:46.400> design<00:03:46.760> I<00:03:46.970> always

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
go along and I do my design I always

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.420 
go along and I do my design I always
wash<00:03:47.480> them<00:03:47.510> and<00:03:48.080> I<00:03:48.470> give<00:03:48.830> them<00:03:48.890> a<00:03:49.040> good<00:03:49.190> wash

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
wash them and I give them a good wash

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.240 
wash them and I give them a good wash
right<00:03:49.880> after<00:03:50.209> I'm<00:03:50.330> done<00:03:50.510> in<00:03:50.780> my<00:03:51.050> cup<00:03:51.770> of<00:03:51.800> water

right after I'm done in my cup of water

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.220 
right after I'm done in my cup of water
and<00:03:52.550> then<00:03:52.700> I<00:03:52.850> dry<00:03:53.090> them<00:03:53.239> and<00:03:53.450> store<00:03:53.720> them<00:03:53.780> so

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
and then I dry them and store them so

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.680 
and then I dry them and store them so
