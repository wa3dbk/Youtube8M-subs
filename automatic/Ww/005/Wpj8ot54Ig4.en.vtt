careful because you can injure yourself
with<00:01:47.549> dead<00:01:47.790> lifting<00:01:48.149> but<00:01:48.540> at<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.720> same<00:01:48.869> time

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
with dead lifting but at the same time

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.270 
with dead lifting but at the same time
you<00:01:49.290> can<00:01:49.409> injure<00:01:49.590> yourself<00:01:49.860> doing<00:01:50.130> any

you can injure yourself doing any
exercise<00:01:51.000> anything<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.799> had<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.070> be

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
exercise anything so you had to be

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.130 
exercise anything so you had to be
careful<00:01:53.369> when<00:01:54.360> you're<00:01:54.509> doing<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.840> upward

careful when you're doing the upward

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.719 
careful when you're doing the upward
motion<00:01:55.290> which<00:01:55.649> is<00:01:55.740> where<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.950> lot<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.100> people<00:01:56.369> go

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
motion which is where a lot of people go

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.270 
motion which is where a lot of people go
wrong<00:01:56.939> with<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.240> lives<00:01:57.770> is<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:58.920> they<00:01:59.040> start

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
wrong with that lives is that they start

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.069 
wrong with that lives is that they start
pulling<00:01:59.460> with<00:01:59.640> their<00:01:59.759> back<00:01:59.939> more<00:02:00.299> obvious

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
pulling with their back more obvious

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.139 
pulling with their back more obvious
doing<00:02:01.259> this<00:02:01.320> myself<00:02:01.610> okay<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.670> start<00:02:02.969> pulling

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
doing this myself okay you start pulling

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.660 
doing this myself okay you start pulling
with<00:02:03.270> your<00:02:03.329> back<00:02:03.600> instead<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.560> thrusting<00:02:05.460> your

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
with your back instead of thrusting your

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.639 
with your back instead of thrusting your
hips<00:02:05.909> forward<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.899> get<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.200> weight<00:02:07.350> up<00:02:07.500> which

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
hips forward to get the weight up which

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.350 
hips forward to get the weight up which
is<00:02:07.770> what<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:08.009> should<00:02:08.069> be<00:02:08.250> doing<00:02:08.369> so<00:02:09.090> when<00:02:09.239> you

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
is what you should be doing so when you

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.240 
is what you should be doing so when you
bend<00:02:09.539> over<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:10.020> you<00:02:10.349> use<00:02:10.500> your<00:02:10.709> back<00:02:10.890> more

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
bend over and you use your back more

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.110 
bend over and you use your back more
there's<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.730> greater<00:02:12.030> risk<00:02:12.150> of

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
there's a greater risk of

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.520 
there's a greater risk of
hyperextending<00:02:13.840> and<00:02:13.959> points<00:02:14.260> on<00:02:14.349> them<00:02:14.440> in

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
hyperextending and points on them in

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.979 
hyperextending and points on them in
your<00:02:14.620> back<00:02:14.799> so<00:02:15.610> when<00:02:16.180> you're<00:02:16.299> doing<00:02:16.420> deadlifts

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
your back so when you're doing deadlifts

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.979 
your back so when you're doing deadlifts
make<00:02:17.260> sure<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.519> upward<00:02:18.879> phase<00:02:19.120> that

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
make sure and the upward phase that

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.289 
make sure and the upward phase that
you're<00:02:20.170> using<00:02:20.500> your<00:02:21.190> hips<00:02:21.430> and<00:02:21.670> thrusting

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
you're using your hips and thrusting

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:24.500 
you're using your hips and thrusting
yourself<00:02:22.690> forward<00:02:22.930> to<00:02:23.560> get<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:23.860> weight<00:02:24.010> up

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
yourself forward to get the weight up

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.630 
yourself forward to get the weight up
that's<00:02:25.510> it<00:02:25.780> they<00:02:26.230> can<00:02:26.500> be<00:02:26.650> safe<00:02:26.920> but<00:02:27.430> at<00:02:27.549> the

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
that's it they can be safe but at the

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.369 
that's it they can be safe but at the
same<00:02:27.790> time<00:02:28.030> if<00:02:28.450> you're<00:02:28.870> not<00:02:29.019> doing<00:02:29.290> them

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
same time if you're not doing them

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.890 
same time if you're not doing them
correctly<00:02:29.769> they<00:02:30.069> can<00:02:30.519> be<00:02:30.670> very<00:02:30.849> hazardous<00:02:31.150> but

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
correctly they can be very hazardous but

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.289 
correctly they can be very hazardous but
that<00:02:32.079> like<00:02:32.349> I<00:02:32.440> said<00:02:32.470> before<00:02:32.940> goes<00:02:33.940> with

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
that like I said before goes with

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.750 
that like I said before goes with
anything<00:02:34.709> there<00:02:35.709> are<00:02:35.860> certain<00:02:36.220> alternatives

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
anything there are certain alternatives

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.509 
anything there are certain alternatives
you<00:02:36.879> can<00:02:37.030> do<00:02:37.180> to<00:02:37.900> replace<00:02:38.680> that<00:02:39.040> lifts<00:02:39.280> in<00:02:39.370> your

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
you can do to replace that lifts in your

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.110 
you can do to replace that lifts in your
workouts<00:02:39.909> I<00:02:40.349> personally<00:02:41.400> prefer<00:02:42.400> trap<00:02:42.879> bar

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
workouts I personally prefer trap bar

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.420 
workouts I personally prefer trap bar
deadlifts<00:02:43.720> now<00:02:44.290> obviously<00:02:44.860> they're<00:02:45.099> the<00:02:45.129> same

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
deadlifts now obviously they're the same

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.569 
deadlifts now obviously they're the same
you<00:02:46.269> know<00:02:46.629> type<00:02:46.870> of<00:02:46.989> exercise<00:02:47.410> but<00:02:48.099> the<00:02:48.280> trap

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
you know type of exercise but the trap

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.300 
you know type of exercise but the trap
bar<00:02:48.959> takes<00:02:49.959> a<00:02:50.079> lot<00:02:50.260> of<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.379> lower<00:02:50.620> back<00:02:50.950> out<00:02:51.250> of

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
bar takes a lot of the lower back out of

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.819 
bar takes a lot of the lower back out of
the<00:02:51.519> equation<00:02:52.030> the<00:02:52.239> way<00:02:52.870> that<00:02:53.079> bar<00:02:53.230> sits<00:02:53.590> is

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
the equation the way that bar sits is

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:57.000 
the equation the way that bar sits is
the<00:02:54.069> weight<00:02:54.280> is<00:02:54.599> across<00:02:55.599> a<00:02:56.019> mid<00:02:56.560> plane<00:02:56.799> of<00:02:56.920> your

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
the weight is across a mid plane of your

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.819 
the weight is across a mid plane of your
body<00:02:57.220> instead<00:02:57.640> of<00:02:57.760> out<00:02:58.000> in<00:02:58.060> front<00:02:58.390> of<00:02:58.450> you<00:02:58.829> so

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
body instead of out in front of you so

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:01.470 
body instead of out in front of you so
it<00:02:59.950> makes<00:02:59.980> a<00:03:00.250> little<00:03:00.459> bit<00:03:00.549> easy<00:03:00.730> and<00:03:00.970> it's<00:03:01.269> it's

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
it makes a little bit easy and it's it's

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.289 
it makes a little bit easy and it's it's
higher<00:03:01.720> up<00:03:01.829> so<00:03:02.829> you're<00:03:03.370> not<00:03:03.400> bending<00:03:03.940> down<00:03:03.970> as

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
higher up so you're not bending down as

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.990 
higher up so you're not bending down as
far<00:03:04.569> and<00:03:04.900> you're<00:03:05.500> not<00:03:05.680> reaching<00:03:06.430> out<00:03:06.700> in<00:03:06.790> front

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
far and you're not reaching out in front

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.490 
far and you're not reaching out in front
of<00:03:07.120> you<00:03:07.209> you're<00:03:07.750> reaching<00:03:07.930> to<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.260> sides

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
of you you're reaching to the sides

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.550 
of you you're reaching to the sides
which<00:03:09.269> helps<00:03:10.269> alleviate<00:03:10.629> some<00:03:11.140> of<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.290> stress

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
which helps alleviate some of the stress

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.940 
which helps alleviate some of the stress
on<00:03:11.739> the<00:03:11.859> lower<00:03:12.010> back<00:03:12.540> now<00:03:13.540> a<00:03:13.900> lot<00:03:14.650> of<00:03:14.680> gyms

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
on the lower back now a lot of gyms

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.339 
on the lower back now a lot of gyms
don't<00:03:15.129> have<00:03:15.400> track<00:03:15.730> bars<00:03:15.970> which<00:03:16.900> is<00:03:17.019> a<00:03:17.049> problem

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
don't have track bars which is a problem

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:19.949 
don't have track bars which is a problem
because<00:03:17.680> I<00:03:17.829> think<00:03:17.950> they're<00:03:18.190> fantastic<00:03:18.370> but<00:03:18.970> if

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
because I think they're fantastic but if

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.330 
because I think they're fantastic but if
you<00:03:20.049> don't<00:03:20.349> have<00:03:20.470> a<00:03:20.500> tribe<00:03:20.769> board<00:03:20.980> in<00:03:21.069> the<00:03:21.160> gym

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
you don't have a tribe board in the gym

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.559 
you don't have a tribe board in the gym
and<00:03:21.459> you<00:03:21.579> still<00:03:21.790> want<00:03:22.030> to<00:03:22.120> use<00:03:22.209> something<00:03:22.450> to

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
and you still want to use something to

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.780 
and you still want to use something to
replace<00:03:22.870> your<00:03:23.079> deadlifts<00:03:23.560> think<00:03:24.489> about<00:03:24.639> doing

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
replace your deadlifts think about doing

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.089 
replace your deadlifts think about doing
rack<00:03:25.090> pulls<00:03:25.389> I<00:03:25.630> just<00:03:26.230> recently<00:03:26.590> started<00:03:26.799> doing

rack pulls I just recently started doing

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:28.650 
rack pulls I just recently started doing
these<00:03:27.160> a<00:03:27.280> couple<00:03:27.519> weeks<00:03:27.669> ago<00:03:27.790> and<00:03:28.120> they're

these a couple weeks ago and they're

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.159 
these a couple weeks ago and they're
fantastic<00:03:28.900> what<00:03:29.829> you<00:03:29.919> do<00:03:30.069> put<00:03:31.030> the<00:03:31.090> rep<00:03:31.359> go<00:03:32.109> to
