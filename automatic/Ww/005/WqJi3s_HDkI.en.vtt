00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.740 
the darker side will remove a lot of
nail<00:01:40.770> all<00:01:41.100> in<00:01:41.310> one<00:01:41.520> go<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.210> it's<00:01:42.329> good<00:01:42.540> if<00:01:42.659> you

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
nail all in one go so it's good if you

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.300 
nail all in one go so it's good if you
want<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:42.960> take<00:01:43.140> your<00:01:43.259> nails<00:01:43.439> from<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.710> longer<00:01:43.950> to

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
want to take your nails from a longer to

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.280 
want to take your nails from a longer to
shorter<00:01:44.790> obviously<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.659> could<00:01:45.869> just<00:01:46.079> use

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
shorter obviously you could just use

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.230 
shorter obviously you could just use
some<00:01:46.320> nail<00:01:46.740> clippers<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.369> then<00:01:47.610> file<00:01:47.939> them

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
some nail clippers and then file them

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.840 
some nail clippers and then file them
how<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.110> file<00:01:49.560> nails<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.520> need<00:01:50.700> to

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
how to file nails is that you need to

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.850 
how to file nails is that you need to
file<00:01:51.060> from<00:01:51.360> either<00:01:51.570> side<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.350> into<00:01:52.770> the

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
file from either side and into the

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.219 
file from either side and into the
center<00:01:53.100> never<00:01:53.939> go<00:01:54.149> backwards<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.750> forwards

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
center never go backwards and forwards

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.800 
center never go backwards and forwards
another<00:01:56.100> good<00:01:56.340> tip<00:01:56.579> is<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.909> bevel<00:01:57.450> your<00:01:57.630> nails

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
another good tip is to bevel your nails

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.389 
another good tip is to bevel your nails
so<00:01:58.229> you're<00:01:58.590> just<00:01:58.770> pulling<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.130> file

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
so you're just pulling the file

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.969 
so you're just pulling the file
downwards<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.299> this<00:02:00.780> seals<00:02:01.079> in<00:02:01.380> all<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.860> the

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
downwards and this seals in all of the

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.940 
downwards and this seals in all of the
layers<00:02:02.159> at<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:03.030> free<00:02:03.240> edge<00:02:03.509> now<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.530> should

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
layers at the free edge now you should

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.980 
layers at the free edge now you should
always<00:02:05.219> use<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.729> base<00:02:06.149> coat<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.719> top<00:02:06.930> coat

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
always use a base coat and a top coat

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.710 
always use a base coat and a top coat
the<00:02:07.799> reason<00:02:08.220> for<00:02:08.340> this<00:02:08.489> is<00:02:08.759> because<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:09.509> base

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
the reason for this is because the base

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.780 
the reason for this is because the base
coat<00:02:10.050> works<00:02:10.319> in<00:02:10.590> two<00:02:10.770> different<00:02:10.950> ways<00:02:11.280> it

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
coat works in two different ways it

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.820 
coat works in two different ways it
stops<00:02:12.780> your<00:02:12.959> nails<00:02:13.200> from<00:02:13.379> staying

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
stops your nails from staying

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.130 
stops your nails from staying
if<00:02:14.070> you're<00:02:14.250> using<00:02:14.520> a<00:02:14.760> darker<00:02:15.150> shade<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:15.750> it

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
if you're using a darker shade and it

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.410 
if you're using a darker shade and it
also<00:02:16.320> helps<00:02:16.860> your<00:02:17.010> nail<00:02:17.220> polish<00:02:17.640> lasts<00:02:17.910> longer

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
also helps your nail polish lasts longer

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.260 
also helps your nail polish lasts longer

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
the same with the top coat the top coat

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.960 
the same with the top coat the top coat

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
is the last step of the system and it

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.780 
is the last step of the system and it
