so<00:02:22.370> much<00:02:22.520> fringe<00:02:22.820> in<00:02:23.060> one<00:02:23.360> place<00:02:23.660> it<00:02:23.990> was

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
so much fringe in one place it was

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.560 
so much fringe in one place it was
ridiculous<00:02:24.440> and<00:02:25.340> I<00:02:25.880> think<00:02:26.120> that<00:02:26.240> this<00:02:26.330> is<00:02:26.390> a

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
ridiculous and I think that this is a

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.510 
ridiculous and I think that this is a
really<00:02:27.050> easy<00:02:27.260> one<00:02:27.560> to<00:02:27.740> recreate<00:02:28.070> at<00:02:28.340> home

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
really easy one to recreate at home

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.370 
really easy one to recreate at home
because<00:02:28.760> all<00:02:29.090> you<00:02:29.210> need<00:02:29.420> is<00:02:29.660> one<00:02:29.930> statement

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
because all you need is one statement

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.530 
because all you need is one statement
fringe<00:02:30.860> piece<00:02:31.160> and<00:02:31.430> then<00:02:31.610> you<00:02:32.030> can<00:02:32.180> just<00:02:32.330> pair

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
fringe piece and then you can just pair

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.150 
fringe piece and then you can just pair
it<00:02:32.630> with<00:02:32.660> whatever<00:02:33.020> you<00:02:33.560> already<00:02:33.890> have<00:02:34.040> in
