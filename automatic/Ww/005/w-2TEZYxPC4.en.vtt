00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.500
 Hello everybody today 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.870

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:21.260
 tell you how the battle is played all available 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.260
 just look and learn how to go 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.430
 through all. 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.280
 20 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.320
 Who 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.960
 SOS 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.520
 zamazh 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.520
 asexual 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.230
 here 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.370
 doll 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.040
 with 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:06.110
 watch 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.110
 look 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:16.010
 and so that's how this song is played fight 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:20.900
 very simple here 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:25.060
 at the beginning of the song to play 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:30.370
 down two times down on each of the chords 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.370
 out of four then plays himself 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.520
 that's the principle of such a fight 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:43.880
 the guys are all pretty simple chords 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:48.170
 a little complicated in terms of the bar and all 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:50.870
 The rest, in principle, I think will not be 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.430
 Thank you all for your attention 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.260
