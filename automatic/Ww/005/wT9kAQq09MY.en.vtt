00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.580 
his side and the two and a half on each
side<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.869> was<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:45.990> bar

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
side so it was a bar

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.860 
side so it was a bar
like<00:01:47.590> this<00:01:47.740> and<00:01:48.100> I<00:01:48.640> just<00:01:48.820> did<00:01:48.970> first<00:01:49.390> said<00:01:49.720> the

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
like this and I just did first said the

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.990 
like this and I just did first said the
heights<00:01:50.050> that<00:01:50.140> it<00:01:50.320> was<00:01:50.440> 15<00:01:50.830> reps<00:01:51.100> for<00:01:51.460> 10<00:01:51.610> to<00:01:51.670> 15

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
heights that it was 15 reps for 10 to 15

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.330 
heights that it was 15 reps for 10 to 15
reps<00:01:52.240> this<00:01:52.990> one<00:01:53.170> I'm<00:01:53.290> focusing<00:01:54.100> more<00:01:54.280> on

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
reps this one I'm focusing more on

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.460 
reps this one I'm focusing more on
bringing<00:01:54.850> about<00:01:54.940> the<00:01:55.690> ball<00:01:55.900> all<00:01:56.050> the<00:01:56.080> way<00:01:56.200> down

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
bringing about the ball all the way down

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.960 
bringing about the ball all the way down
to<00:01:56.650> my<00:01:56.770> chest<00:01:57.040> touching<00:01:57.460> my<00:01:57.550> chest<00:01:57.760> and

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
to my chest touching my chest and

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.030 
to my chest touching my chest and
shilling<00:01:58.540> back<00:01:58.720> up<00:01:58.900> and<00:01:59.500> I<00:01:59.620> see<00:01:59.680> a<00:01:59.740> reason<00:01:59.980> why

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
shilling back up and I see a reason why

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.090 
shilling back up and I see a reason why
actually<00:02:00.700> doing<00:02:01.120> so<00:02:01.270> light<00:02:01.480> and<00:02:02.080> I<00:02:02.680> focus<00:02:02.980> on

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
actually doing so light and I focus on

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.340 
actually doing so light and I focus on
high<00:02:03.280> reps<00:02:03.550> of<00:02:03.820> course<00:02:04.090> because<00:02:04.960> heavy

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
high reps of course because heavy

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.780 
high reps of course because heavy
exercises<00:02:05.890> don't<00:02:06.160> go<00:02:06.250> to<00:02:06.310> develop<00:02:06.700> my

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
exercises don't go to develop my

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.460 
exercises don't go to develop my
shoulders<00:02:07.180> because<00:02:07.900> it's<00:02:08.050> such<00:02:08.170> a<00:02:08.200> small

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
shoulders because it's such a small

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.100 
shoulders because it's such a small
muscle<00:02:09.330> should<00:02:10.330> lift<00:02:10.510> heavy<00:02:10.690> when<00:02:10.930> you<00:02:10.990> do

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
muscle should lift heavy when you do

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.840 
muscle should lift heavy when you do
back<00:02:11.350> legs<00:02:11.710> and<00:02:11.920> chest<00:02:11.950> but<00:02:12.340> not<00:02:12.370> shoulders

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
back legs and chest but not shoulders

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.570 
back legs and chest but not shoulders
just<00:02:13.780> focus<00:02:14.170> on<00:02:14.350> you<00:02:14.530> know<00:02:14.560> getting<00:02:15.220> a<00:02:15.430> full

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
just focus on you know getting a full

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.190 
just focus on you know getting a full
contraction<00:02:15.910> and<00:02:16.240> stretching<00:02:16.600> awesome

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.510 
and after that I went on I actually did
a<00:02:18.910> shoulder<00:02:19.840> chest<00:02:20.410> would<00:02:20.890> change<00:02:21.130> which<00:02:21.370> I

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
a shoulder chest would change which I

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.190 
a shoulder chest would change which I

in fresh usually want to do chest it's
the<00:02:46.660> first<00:02:46.900> thing<00:02:47.020> I<00:02:47.140> do<00:02:47.200> in<00:02:47.410> business<00:02:47.530> through

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
the first thing I do in business through

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.820 
the first thing I do in business through
the<00:02:47.950> second<00:02:48.630> attack<00:02:49.630> and<00:02:50.350> they<00:02:50.410> have<00:02:50.560> all<00:02:50.709> my

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.610 
the second attack and they have all my
strength<00:02:51.160> so<00:02:51.400> I<00:02:51.600> have<00:02:52.600> to<00:02:52.750> incline<00:02:53.170> dumbbell<00:02:53.350> I

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
strength so I have to incline dumbbell I

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.810 
strength so I have to incline dumbbell I
just<00:02:53.800> fought<00:02:53.920> his<00:02:54.040> fingers<00:02:54.280> on<00:02:54.430> his<00:02:54.520> upper

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
just fought his fingers on his upper

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.290 
just fought his fingers on his upper
region<00:02:55.150> incline<00:02:55.690> upper<00:02:56.560> chest<00:02:56.860> front<00:02:57.400> delts

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
region incline upper chest front delts

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.900 
region incline upper chest front delts
so<00:02:58.810> incline<00:02:59.230> dumbbell<00:02:59.440> presses<00:02:59.890> false<00:03:00.580> tester

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
so incline dumbbell presses false tester

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.040 
so incline dumbbell presses false tester
that<00:03:02.310> always<00:03:03.310> above<00:03:03.550> the<00:03:03.580> 10<00:03:03.880> rep<00:03:04.060> range<00:03:04.300> then

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
that always above the 10 rep range then

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.440 
that always above the 10 rep range then
after<00:03:05.290> that<00:03:05.410> I<00:03:05.530> did<00:03:05.709> this<00:03:06.580> exercise<00:03:06.790> here<00:03:07.330> I

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
after that I did this exercise here I

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.240 
after that I did this exercise here I
