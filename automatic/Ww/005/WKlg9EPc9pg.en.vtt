00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.660 
right-handed quarterback and if he's a
left-handed<00:02:21.630> quarterback<00:02:22.190> so<00:02:23.190> that<00:02:23.370> we<00:02:23.490> don't

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
left-handed quarterback so that we don't

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.670 
left-handed quarterback so that we don't
have<00:02:23.820> to<00:02:23.940> change<00:02:24.210> anything<00:02:24.570> in<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:24.900> operation

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
have to change anything in the operation

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.110 
have to change anything in the operation
we<00:02:26.400> just<00:02:26.670> put<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.090> strings<00:02:27.480> down<00:02:28.760> and<00:02:29.760> that

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
we just put the strings down and that

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.900 
we just put the strings down and that
way<00:02:30.330> when<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.660> ball<00:02:30.870> naturally<00:02:31.560> turns<00:02:31.910> the

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
way when the ball naturally turns the

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.360 
way when the ball naturally turns the
quarterback<00:02:33.480> when<00:02:34.170> he's<00:02:34.320> left-handed<00:02:34.650> we'll

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
quarterback when he's left-handed we'll

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.180 
quarterback when he's left-handed we'll
have<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.820> strings<00:02:36.240> across<00:02:36.930> his<00:02:37.350> left<00:02:37.560> hand<00:02:37.890> as

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
have the strings across his left hand as

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.700 
have the strings across his left hand as
he<00:02:38.340> sets<00:02:38.610> up<00:02:38.790> to<00:02:38.940> pass<00:02:39.180> that's<00:02:39.990> the<00:02:40.200> idea<00:02:40.620> so

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
he sets up to pass that's the idea so

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.200 
he sets up to pass that's the idea so
the<00:02:41.010> quarterback<00:02:41.520> does<00:02:41.700> not<00:02:41.850> have<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.090> be

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
the quarterback does not have to be

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.230 
the quarterback does not have to be
fumbling<00:02:42.660> with<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.080> ball<00:02:43.290> as<00:02:43.650> he<00:02:43.860> sets<00:02:44.130> up<00:02:44.370> so

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
fumbling with the ball as he sets up so

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.960 
fumbling with the ball as he sets up so
we're<00:02:45.390> going<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.600> assume<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:46.020> position<00:02:46.970> we're

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
we're going to assume the position we're

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.040 
we're going to assume the position we're
going<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.150> get<00:02:48.330> up<00:02:48.450> in<00:02:48.600> there<00:02:48.840> with<00:02:48.870> our
