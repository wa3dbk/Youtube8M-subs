another<00:00:03.990> update<00:00:04.290> to<00:00:04.620> my<00:00:04.740> aquaponic<00:00:05.339> setup<00:00:06.410> my

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
another update to my aquaponic setup my

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.370 
another update to my aquaponic setup my
last<00:00:07.620> update<00:00:07.859> I<00:00:08.099> just<00:00:08.340> finished<00:00:08.670> building<00:00:09.380> my

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
last update I just finished building my

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.810 
last update I just finished building my
initial<00:00:10.800> design<00:00:11.690> but<00:00:12.690> I<00:00:12.719> had<00:00:12.960> mentioned<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.559> few

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:13.820 
initial design but I had mentioned a few

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.519 
initial design but I had mentioned a few
concerns<00:00:14.820> that<00:00:15.030> I<00:00:15.150> had<00:00:15.360> about<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:16.170> way<00:00:16.320> I<00:00:16.350> had

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
concerns that I had about the way I had

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.920 
concerns that I had about the way I had
originally<00:00:16.710> built<00:00:17.190> it<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.660> after<00:00:18.660> hearing

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
originally built it and after hearing

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.359 
originally built it and after hearing
some<00:00:19.199> good<00:00:19.380> comments<00:00:19.619> from<00:00:20.010> some<00:00:20.220> other

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
some good comments from some other

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.000 
some good comments from some other
youtubers<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:21.090> decided<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.720> make<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.590> few<00:00:22.830> more

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
youtubers I decided to make a few more

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.859 
youtubers I decided to make a few more
changes<00:00:23.460> before<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:23.850> actually<00:00:24.060> go<00:00:24.420> live<00:00:24.630> with

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
changes before I actually go live with

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.339 
changes before I actually go live with
this<00:00:25.019> thing<00:00:25.340> so<00:00:26.599> one<00:00:27.599> of<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.720> concerns<00:00:27.900> was

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
this thing so one of the concerns was

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.349 
this thing so one of the concerns was
the<00:00:28.470> fact<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:29.010> was<00:00:29.279> using<00:00:29.550> tap<00:00:29.760> water<00:00:29.789> fill

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
the fact that I was using tap water fill

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.569 
the fact that I was using tap water fill
it<00:00:30.480> up<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:31.230> although<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:31.650> had<00:00:31.859> hoped<00:00:32.099> the

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
it up and although I had hoped the

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.370 
it up and although I had hoped the
amount<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.270> filling<00:00:33.630> that<00:00:33.780> would<00:00:33.989> happen<00:00:34.260> at

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
amount of filling that would happen at

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.170 
amount of filling that would happen at
any<00:00:34.590> given<00:00:34.770> time<00:00:34.980> would<00:00:35.190> be<00:00:35.309> relatively<00:00:35.760> small

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
any given time would be relatively small

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.680 
any given time would be relatively small
and<00:00:36.450> small<00:00:37.230> enough<00:00:37.410> not<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:38.090> hurt<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.300> fish<00:00:39.480> or

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
and small enough not to hurt the fish or

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.110 
and small enough not to hurt the fish or
plants<00:00:39.899> with<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.010> chlorine<00:00:41.550> in<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.940> tap

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
plants with the chlorine in the tap

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.720 
plants with the chlorine in the tap
water<00:00:42.800> it's<00:00:43.800> not<00:00:43.920> like<00:00:44.129> some<00:00:44.309> other<00:00:44.370> people

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
water it's not like some other people

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.779 
water it's not like some other people
had<00:00:44.879> some<00:00:45.120> concerns<00:00:45.660> about<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:46.079> and

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
had some concerns about that and

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:48.950 
had some concerns about that and
recommended<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:47.879> do<00:00:47.940> something<00:00:48.329> else<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:48.840> what

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
recommended I do something else so what

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.790 
recommended I do something else so what
I<00:00:49.020> ended<00:00:49.260> up<00:00:49.379> doing<00:00:50.030> is<00:00:51.030> creating<00:00:51.660> instead<00:00:52.649> of

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
I ended up doing is creating instead of

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.740 
I ended up doing is creating instead of
down<00:00:53.280> here<00:00:53.520> which<00:00:53.730> would<00:00:53.910> used<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.270> be<00:00:54.360> plugged

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
down here which would used to be plugged

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.830 
down here which would used to be plugged
into<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.230> tap<00:00:55.760> I've<00:00:56.760> not<00:00:57.000> bought<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.510> cheap

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
into the tap I've not bought a cheap

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.560 
into the tap I've not bought a cheap
trashcan<00:00:58.649> fitted<00:00:59.520> another<00:00:59.670> of<00:01:00.000> my<00:01:00.180> one-inch

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
trashcan fitted another of my one-inch

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.570 
trashcan fitted another of my one-inch
seal<00:01:01.440> joints<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:04.100> basically<00:01:05.100> what<00:01:05.519> I'm

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
seal joints to it and basically what I'm

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.940 
seal joints to it and basically what I'm
going<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.729> do<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.210> manually<00:01:07.200> fill<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:07.560> guy<00:01:07.740> up

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
going to do is manually fill this guy up

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.000 
going to do is manually fill this guy up
every<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:08.400> often<00:01:08.580> with<00:01:09.479> tap<00:01:09.720> water<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.290> let

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
every so often with tap water and let

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.030 
every so often with tap water and let
him<00:01:11.130> sit<00:01:11.400> for<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.640> while<00:01:11.790> before<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.270> fill<00:01:13.040> my

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
him sit for a while before I fill my

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.760 
him sit for a while before I fill my
tank<00:01:14.310> from<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.930> so<00:01:15.930> basically<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.439> idea<00:01:16.710> is

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
tank from it so basically the idea is

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.270 
tank from it so basically the idea is
this<00:01:17.280> will<00:01:17.400> be<00:01:17.490> full<00:01:17.700> most<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.119> time<00:01:18.360> and

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
this will be full most of the time and

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.730 
this will be full most of the time and
I'll<00:01:20.280> give<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.270> time<00:01:21.570> for<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.990> evaporate<00:01:22.380> for

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
I'll give it time for the evaporate for

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.130 
I'll give it time for the evaporate for
the<00:01:22.860> chlorine<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.400> evaporate<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:24.119> then<00:01:25.049> I'll

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
the chlorine to evaporate and then I'll

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.990 
the chlorine to evaporate and then I'll
use<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.470> water<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:26.009> fill<00:01:26.189> up<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.460> tank<00:01:26.640> and

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
use that water to fill up the tank and

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.410 
use that water to fill up the tank and
so<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:27.869> underwater<00:01:28.710> pipe<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.220> again<00:01:29.520> hooked

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
so that underwater pipe is again hooked

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.149 
so that underwater pipe is again hooked
up<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:32.030> this<00:01:33.030> guy<00:01:33.240> coming<00:01:33.630> up<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.049> then<00:01:34.890> drains

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
up to this guy coming up and then drains

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.710 
up to this guy coming up and then drains
right<00:01:35.340> in<00:01:35.490> there

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
right in there

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.830 
right in there
so<00:01:37.290> one<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.160> the<00:01:38.910> ramifications<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.690> that

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
so one of the ramifications of that

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.720 
so one of the ramifications of that
change<00:01:40.200> which<00:01:40.620> was<00:01:40.800> kind<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.070> disappointing

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730 
change which was kind of disappointing

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.620 
change which was kind of disappointing
was<00:01:42.770> my<00:01:43.770> original<00:01:44.400> idea<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:45.060> having<00:01:45.360> this

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
was my original idea of having this

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.740 
was my original idea of having this
thing<00:01:45.840> autofill<00:01:46.410> using<00:01:46.800> a<00:01:46.890> toilet<00:01:47.250> valve

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
thing autofill using a toilet valve

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.210 
thing autofill using a toilet valve
worked<00:01:48.750> fine<00:01:48.960> when<00:01:49.230> it<00:01:49.320> was<00:01:49.350> under<00:01:49.620> tap<00:01:49.830> water

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
worked fine when it was under tap water

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.940 
worked fine when it was under tap water
pressure<00:01:50.580> but<00:01:51.030> just<00:01:52.020> gravity<00:01:52.500> pressure<00:01:52.710> is

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
pressure but just gravity pressure is

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.660 
pressure but just gravity pressure is
not<00:01:53.100> enough<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.640> engage<00:01:53.910> one<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.330> those<00:01:54.450> valves

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
not enough to engage one of those valves

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.460 
not enough to engage one of those valves
so<00:01:56.670> unfortunately<00:01:57.480> that<00:01:57.660> wasn't<00:01:57.960> working<00:01:58.110> to

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
so unfortunately that wasn't working to

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.290 
so unfortunately that wasn't working to
autofill<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.310> was<00:01:59.400> basically<00:01:59.700> just<00:01:59.850> always

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
autofill it it was basically just always

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
autofill it it was basically just always
off<00:02:00.560> so<00:02:01.940> rather<00:02:02.940> than<00:02:03.180> spend<00:02:04.050> a<00:02:04.080> bunch<00:02:04.230> of

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
off so rather than spend a bunch of

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.540 
off so rather than spend a bunch of
money<00:02:04.380> trying<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.860> find<00:02:05.040> something<00:02:05.250> else<00:02:05.460> that

money trying to find something else that

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.210 
money trying to find something else that
would<00:02:05.820> work<00:02:05.940> I'm<00:02:06.270> my<00:02:06.870> plan<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.260> to<00:02:07.410> just<00:02:07.470> keep

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
would work I'm my plan is to just keep

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.669 
would work I'm my plan is to just keep
an<00:02:08.550> eye<00:02:08.670> on<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.720> tank<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:10.080> large<00:02:10.350> enough

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
an eye on it the tank is large enough

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.560 
an eye on it the tank is large enough
that<00:02:10.920> I<00:02:11.460> don't<00:02:11.670> think<00:02:11.910> I'm<00:02:12.030> gonna<00:02:12.150> have<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.420> be

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
that I don't think I'm gonna have to be

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.040 
that I don't think I'm gonna have to be
constantly<00:02:13.490> watching<00:02:14.490> a<00:02:14.580> water<00:02:14.760> level<00:02:15.050> to

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
constantly watching a water level to

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.440 
constantly watching a water level to
keep<00:02:16.230> my<00:02:16.380> pump<00:02:16.680> alive

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
keep my pump alive

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.640 
keep my pump alive
the<00:02:19.380> water<00:02:19.590> can<00:02:20.040> be<00:02:20.070> quite<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:20.460> bit<00:02:20.670> higher<00:02:20.940> than

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
the water can be quite a bit higher than

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.130 
the water can be quite a bit higher than
the<00:02:22.650> pump<00:02:22.950> under<00:02:23.700> normal<00:02:23.880> normal<00:02:24.630> operation

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
the pump under normal normal operation

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.200 
the pump under normal normal operation
we're<00:02:25.290> still<00:02:25.440> giving<00:02:25.530> me<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.710> pretty<00:02:25.980> good

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
we're still giving me a pretty good

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.180 
we're still giving me a pretty good
window<00:02:27.210> of<00:02:27.390> opportunity<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.140> fill<00:02:28.560> this<00:02:28.710> up<00:02:28.890> I

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
window of opportunity to fill this up I

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.340 
window of opportunity to fill this up I
fitted<00:02:29.850> this<00:02:30.030> ball<00:02:30.270> valve<00:02:30.510> here<00:02:30.930> because

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
fitted this ball valve here because

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.960 
fitted this ball valve here because
obviously<00:02:31.590> there's<00:02:32.070> not<00:02:32.220> any<00:02:32.520> valve<00:02:32.730> on<00:02:32.910> the

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
obviously there's not any valve on the

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.090 
obviously there's not any valve on the
other<00:02:33.150> end<00:02:33.270> now<00:02:33.480> so<00:02:33.810> if<00:02:34.320> I<00:02:34.470> do<00:02:34.530> want<00:02:34.830> to<00:02:34.920> still

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
other end now so if I do want to still

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.860 
other end now so if I do want to still
use<00:02:35.280> this<00:02:35.460> with<00:02:35.670> tap<00:02:35.880> water<00:02:35.910> pressure<00:02:36.450> which<00:02:36.720> I

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
use this with tap water pressure which I

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.770 
use this with tap water pressure which I
can<00:02:37.020> do<00:02:37.170> just<00:02:37.440> by<00:02:37.470> moving<00:02:38.310> that<00:02:38.550> hose<00:02:38.850> down

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
can do just by moving that hose down

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.500 
can do just by moving that hose down
there<00:02:40.080> and<00:02:40.350> put<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.160> screwing<00:02:41.940> it<00:02:42.090> into<00:02:42.239> the

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
there and put and screwing it into the

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.800 
there and put and screwing it into the
tap<00:02:42.720> instead<00:02:43.140> of<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.320> bucket<00:02:44.570> then<00:02:45.570> I'll<00:02:45.660> need

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
tap instead of the bucket then I'll need

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.630 
tap instead of the bucket then I'll need
to<00:02:45.900> shut<00:02:46.110> off<00:02:46.230> this<00:02:46.590> valve<00:02:46.860> so<00:02:47.220> that<00:02:47.250> I<00:02:47.400> don't

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
to shut off this valve so that I don't

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.150 
to shut off this valve so that I don't
fill<00:02:47.850> my<00:02:47.880> tank<00:02:48.180> with<00:02:48.300> tap<00:02:48.660> water<00:02:49.100> so<00:02:50.100> that's

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
fill my tank with tap water so that's

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.220 
fill my tank with tap water so that's
why<00:02:50.370> that's<00:02:50.489> there<00:02:50.820> all<00:02:51.780> right<00:02:51.870> so<00:02:51.930> that<00:02:52.140> was

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
why that's there all right so that was

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.430 
why that's there all right so that was
one<00:02:52.350> of<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.500> changes<00:02:52.739> another<00:02:53.730> change<00:02:54.060> was<00:02:54.440> I

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
one of the changes another change was I

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.440 
one of the changes another change was I
was<00:02:56.040> concerned<00:02:56.310> about<00:02:56.459> this<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:57.000> others<00:02:57.209> kind

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
was concerned about this and others kind

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.310 
was concerned about this and others kind
of<00:02:57.600> agreed

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
of agreed

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.920 
of agreed
my<00:02:59.040> original<00:02:59.280> support<00:03:00.000> structure<00:03:00.570> for<00:03:00.600> these

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
my original support structure for these

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.560 
my original support structure for these
tanks<00:03:01.440> our<00:03:02.070> grow<00:03:02.400> beds<00:03:02.640> was<00:03:03.060> pretty<00:03:03.330> flimsy

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
tanks our grow beds was pretty flimsy

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.870 
tanks our grow beds was pretty flimsy
and<00:03:04.380> I<00:03:04.590> was<00:03:04.680> just<00:03:04.830> using<00:03:05.130> this<00:03:05.250> two<00:03:05.489> by<00:03:05.640> two

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.550 

they<00:03:08.880> were<00:03:09.000> bowing<00:03:09.420> and<00:03:09.690> they<00:03:09.810> were<00:03:09.870> looking<00:03:10.080> a

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
they were bowing and they were looking a

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.880 
they were bowing and they were looking a
little<00:03:10.920> bit<00:03:11.130> sketchy<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:12.420> so<00:03:13.170> what<00:03:13.320> I<00:03:13.350> did<00:03:13.470> is

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
little bit sketchy and so what I did is

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.210 
little bit sketchy and so what I did is
I<00:03:14.160> fitted<00:03:14.519> another<00:03:14.940> beam<00:03:15.209> across<00:03:15.890> and<00:03:16.890> that<00:03:17.010> is

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
I fitted another beam across and that is

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.949 
I fitted another beam across and that is
I<00:03:17.250> don't<00:03:17.519> know<00:03:17.580> if<00:03:17.640> you<00:03:17.700> can<00:03:17.850> see<00:03:18.090> it's<00:03:18.690> hanging

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
I don't know if you can see it's hanging

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.150 
I don't know if you can see it's hanging
on<00:03:19.110> those<00:03:19.320> little<00:03:19.500> 2x4<00:03:20.250> brackets<00:03:20.850> and<00:03:22.160> then

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
on those little 2x4 brackets and then

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.699 
on those little 2x4 brackets and then
just<00:03:23.370> barely<00:03:23.850> fit<00:03:24.060> above<00:03:24.300> my<00:03:24.420> tank<00:03:24.720> and<00:03:25.050> then

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
just barely fit above my tank and then

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.890 
just barely fit above my tank and then
and<00:03:26.220> then<00:03:26.550> I<00:03:26.610> also<00:03:26.760> screwed<00:03:27.150> on<00:03:27.300> these<00:03:27.510> little

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
and then I also screwed on these little

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.930 
and then I also screwed on these little
pieces<00:03:28.019> of<00:03:28.260> 2x2<00:03:28.530> just<00:03:28.920> to<00:03:29.040> give<00:03:29.730> it<00:03:29.760> a<00:03:29.850> little

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
pieces of 2x2 just to give it a little

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.620 
pieces of 2x2 just to give it a little
more<00:03:30.150> a<00:03:30.450> few<00:03:30.720> more<00:03:30.780> screws<00:03:31.230> to<00:03:31.470> hold<00:03:31.680> these<00:03:31.890> in

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
more a few more screws to hold these in

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.729 
more a few more screws to hold these in
place<00:03:33.630> so<00:03:33.870> they<00:03:33.959> don't<00:03:33.989> slide<00:03:34.380> out<00:03:34.410> or

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
place so they don't slide out or

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.949 
place so they don't slide out or
whatever<00:03:35.150> but<00:03:36.150> they<00:03:36.300> look<00:03:36.480> a<00:03:36.600> lot<00:03:36.780> better

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
whatever but they look a lot better

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.030 
whatever but they look a lot better
they're<00:03:37.290> not<00:03:37.440> bowing<00:03:37.790> really<00:03:38.790> at<00:03:38.910> all<00:03:39.090> and<00:03:39.300> now

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
they're not bowing really at all and now

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.149 
they're not bowing really at all and now
and<00:03:40.870> in<00:03:41.870> any<00:03:41.989> direction<00:03:42.230> so<00:03:42.799> I'm<00:03:42.920> pretty<00:03:43.040> happy

00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:43.159 
and in any direction so I'm pretty happy

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:44.770 
and in any direction so I'm pretty happy
about<00:03:43.400> that<00:03:43.549> I'm<00:03:44.150> not<00:03:44.329> worried<00:03:44.569> at<00:03:44.629> all<00:03:44.720> about

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
about that I'm not worried at all about

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.720 
about that I'm not worried at all about
this<00:03:45.140> thing<00:03:46.030> collapsing<00:03:47.030> anymore<00:03:48.579> and<00:03:49.579> then

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
this thing collapsing anymore and then

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.839 
this thing collapsing anymore and then
finally<00:03:50.150> another<00:03:50.269> thing<00:03:50.720> that<00:03:50.989> I<00:03:51.019> had

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
finally another thing that I had

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:54.970 
finally another thing that I had
mentioned<00:03:52.849> was<00:03:53.060> concerning<00:03:53.599> was<00:03:53.930> my<00:03:54.890> original

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
mentioned was concerning was my original

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.789 
mentioned was concerning was my original
design<00:03:55.519> had<00:03:55.819> both<00:03:56.120> tanks<00:03:56.900> draining<00:03:57.440> into<00:03:57.680> the

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
design had both tanks draining into the

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.300 
design had both tanks draining into the
same<00:03:58.040> pipe<00:03:58.340> and<00:03:59.829> that's<00:04:00.829> not<00:04:00.950> really<00:04:01.099> a<00:04:01.190> good

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
same pipe and that's not really a good

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.910 
same pipe and that's not really a good
idea<00:04:01.610> it<00:04:01.819> can<00:04:01.940> cause<00:04:02.209> the<00:04:02.870> siphons<00:04:03.440> to<00:04:03.680> kind<00:04:03.860> of

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
idea it can cause the siphons to kind of

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.160 
idea it can cause the siphons to kind of
interfere<00:04:04.340> with<00:04:04.549> each<00:04:04.579> other<00:04:04.909> and<00:04:05.209> I<00:04:05.390> did

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
interfere with each other and I did

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.740 
interfere with each other and I did
notice<00:04:06.530> that<00:04:06.560> there<00:04:06.890> were<00:04:07.040> times<00:04:07.220> when<00:04:07.750> if

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
notice that there were times when if

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.330 
notice that there were times when if
they<00:04:08.900> both<00:04:09.109> filled<00:04:09.349> at<00:04:09.500> the<00:04:09.620> same<00:04:09.799> time<00:04:10.069> they

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
they both filled at the same time they

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.610 
they both filled at the same time they
might<00:04:10.489> not<00:04:10.670> activate<00:04:11.150> at<00:04:11.329> once<00:04:11.510> and<00:04:11.780> one<00:04:12.440> would

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
might not activate at once and one would

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.390 
might not activate at once and one would
get<00:04:12.769> too<00:04:12.950> full<00:04:13.299> so<00:04:14.299> I<00:04:14.329> split<00:04:14.599> them<00:04:14.780> up<00:04:14.900> and

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
get too full so I split them up and

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.580 
get too full so I split them up and
initially<00:04:16.400> I<00:04:16.639> had<00:04:17.060> them<00:04:18.039> bent<00:04:19.039> up<00:04:19.639> and<00:04:20.350> over<00:04:21.350> on

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
initially I had them bent up and over on

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.830 
initially I had them bent up and over on
above<00:04:22.340> this<00:04:22.490> lip<00:04:22.820> here<00:04:24.430> to<00:04:25.430> drain<00:04:25.699> in<00:04:25.910> but<00:04:26.120> what

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
above this lip here to drain in but what

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.110 
above this lip here to drain in but what
that<00:04:26.990> ended<00:04:27.260> up<00:04:27.380> doing<00:04:27.740> was<00:04:27.919> making<00:04:28.820> the

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
that ended up doing was making the

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.810 
that ended up doing was making the
lowest<00:04:29.449> point<00:04:29.720> in<00:04:29.870> this<00:04:30.050> pipe<00:04:30.490> always<00:04:31.490> full<00:04:31.699> of

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
lowest point in this pipe always full of

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.060 
lowest point in this pipe always full of
water<00:04:32.060> and<00:04:32.389> so<00:04:33.080> that<00:04:33.229> also<00:04:33.410> seemed<00:04:33.949> to

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
water and so that also seemed to

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.800 
water and so that also seemed to
interfere<00:04:34.460> with<00:04:34.550> the<00:04:34.699> siphon<00:04:35.240> and<00:04:35.419> so<00:04:35.539> I<00:04:35.570> ended

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
interfere with the siphon and so I ended

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.659 
interfere with the siphon and so I ended
up<00:04:36.020> having<00:04:36.350> to<00:04:36.410> cut<00:04:36.440> out<00:04:36.710> that<00:04:36.919> old<00:04:37.070> notch<00:04:37.310> and

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
up having to cut out that old notch and

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.629 
up having to cut out that old notch and
then<00:04:38.270> Bend<00:04:38.479> the<00:04:38.570> pipes<00:04:38.780> back<00:04:39.080> down<00:04:39.380> so<00:04:39.770> the

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
then Bend the pipes back down so the

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.740 
then Bend the pipes back down so the
siphons<00:04:41.300> now<00:04:41.479> break<00:04:41.840> nice<00:04:42.289> and<00:04:42.530> and<00:04:42.800> quickly

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
siphons now break nice and and quickly

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.330 
siphons now break nice and and quickly
but<00:04:44.750> for<00:04:44.900> some<00:04:45.050> reason<00:04:45.410> when<00:04:45.680> I<00:04:45.710> had<00:04:45.979> this<00:04:46.130> set

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
but for some reason when I had this set

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.159 
but for some reason when I had this set
up<00:04:46.460> originally<00:04:46.699> with<00:04:47.210> the<00:04:47.240> two<00:04:47.539> systems

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
up originally with the two systems

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.800 
up originally with the two systems
draining<00:04:49.039> into<00:04:49.190> the<00:04:49.310> same<00:04:49.520> pipe<00:04:49.820> even<00:04:50.599> though

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
draining into the same pipe even though

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.240 
draining into the same pipe even though
I<00:04:50.840> had<00:04:51.050> some<00:04:51.080> issues<00:04:51.380> that<00:04:51.620> seemed<00:04:52.010> to<00:04:52.099> always

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
I had some issues that seemed to always

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.900 
I had some issues that seemed to always
start<00:04:52.729> the<00:04:52.910> siphon<00:04:53.120> of<00:04:53.650> reliably<00:04:54.650> but<00:04:55.580> once<00:04:55.789> I

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
start the siphon of reliably but once I

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.020 
start the siphon of reliably but once I
split<00:04:56.240> them<00:04:56.330> up<00:04:56.510> and<00:04:56.780> make<00:04:57.349> it<00:04:57.380> more<00:04:57.530> proper

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
split them up and make it more proper

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.760 
split them up and make it more proper
they<00:04:59.510> weren't<00:04:59.750> starting<00:05:00.050> reliably<00:05:00.560> they

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
they weren't starting reliably they

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.110 
they weren't starting reliably they
would<00:05:00.889> kind<00:05:01.070> of<00:05:01.160> stay<00:05:01.340> in<00:05:01.370> the<00:05:01.520> full<00:05:01.699> position

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
would kind of stay in the full position

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.629 
would kind of stay in the full position
a<00:05:02.210> lot<00:05:02.360> and<00:05:02.690> I'm<00:05:03.410> only<00:05:03.680> very<00:05:03.949> rarely<00:05:04.160> with<00:05:04.520> the

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 
a lot and I'm only very rarely with the

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:07.450 
a lot and I'm only very rarely with the
siphon<00:05:04.970> actually<00:05:05.300> really<00:05:05.570> activate<00:05:06.020> and<00:05:06.470> so<00:05:07.130> I

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
siphon actually really activate and so I

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.689 
siphon actually really activate and so I
tried<00:05:08.060> plugging<00:05:08.690> one<00:05:08.990> of<00:05:09.110> these<00:05:09.199> to<00:05:09.470> see<00:05:09.650> if

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:09.699 
tried plugging one of these to see if

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:12.219 
tried plugging one of these to see if
faster<00:05:10.699> water<00:05:10.910> flow<00:05:11.240> would<00:05:11.449> would<00:05:11.900> fix<00:05:12.139> that

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
faster water flow would would fix that

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:16.120 
faster water flow would would fix that
and<00:05:12.860> it<00:05:13.460> did<00:05:13.669> so<00:05:14.510> I<00:05:14.810> could<00:05:15.139> upgrade<00:05:15.650> my<00:05:15.830> pump

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
and it did so I could upgrade my pump

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.189 
and it did so I could upgrade my pump
but<00:05:16.940> another<00:05:17.210> thing<00:05:17.479> and<00:05:17.690> a<00:05:17.720> cheaper<00:05:18.050> way<00:05:18.169> to

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:18.199 
but another thing and a cheaper way to

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:21.850 
but another thing and a cheaper way to
go<00:05:19.030> rather<00:05:20.030> than<00:05:20.180> replace<00:05:20.449> my<00:05:20.630> pump<00:05:20.870> is<00:05:21.199> I<00:05:21.800> just

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
go rather than replace my pump is I just

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.490 
go rather than replace my pump is I just
added<00:05:22.400> something<00:05:23.330> to<00:05:23.510> these<00:05:24.940> stand<00:05:25.940> pipes

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
added something to these stand pipes

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.860 
added something to these stand pipes
basically<00:05:27.500> I<00:05:27.710> just<00:05:27.979> put<00:05:28.419> some<00:05:29.419> so<00:05:29.630> this<00:05:29.750> is

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
basically I just put some so this is

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.500 
basically I just put some so this is
one-inch<00:05:30.169> stand<00:05:30.620> pipe<00:05:30.860> and<00:05:31.849> what<00:05:31.940> I<00:05:31.970> did<00:05:32.210> is<00:05:32.419> I

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
one-inch stand pipe and what I did is I

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.270 
one-inch stand pipe and what I did is I
put<00:05:32.650> just<00:05:33.760> a<00:05:34.760> piece<00:05:34.940> of<00:05:34.970> half-inch<00:05:35.710> with<00:05:36.710> a

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
put just a piece of half-inch with a

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.500 
put just a piece of half-inch with a
coupler<00:05:38.240> on<00:05:38.449> it<00:05:38.630> coupling<00:05:39.169> and<00:05:40.240> I'm<00:05:41.240> just

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
coupler on it coupling and I'm just

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.899 
coupler on it coupling and I'm just
using<00:05:41.840> that<00:05:41.960> to<00:05:42.020> reduce<00:05:42.530> the<00:05:43.010> amount<00:05:43.190> of<00:05:43.340> flow

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:43.909 
using that to reduce the amount of flow

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:46.480 
using that to reduce the amount of flow
as<00:05:44.240> it<00:05:44.419> drains<00:05:44.650> that<00:05:45.650> seems<00:05:45.919> to<00:05:46.039> fix<00:05:46.280> that

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
as it drains that seems to fix that

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:47.690 
as it drains that seems to fix that
problem<00:05:46.729> they<00:05:47.090> now

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 
problem they now

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.410 
problem they now
the<00:05:48.030> siphon<00:05:48.510> starts<00:05:48.930> reliably<00:05:49.830> now<00:05:50.070> and

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:50.420 
the siphon starts reliably now and

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.850 
the siphon starts reliably now and
haven't<00:05:51.420> had<00:05:51.480> any<00:05:51.660> issues<00:05:51.960> and<00:05:52.290> it's<00:05:52.470> a<00:05:52.710> big

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
haven't had any issues and it's a big

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.290 
haven't had any issues and it's a big
enough<00:05:53.070> diameter<00:05:53.550> that<00:05:53.670> it<00:05:53.790> cell<00:05:54.000> drains

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
enough diameter that it cell drains

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.710 
enough diameter that it cell drains
quickly<00:05:55.640> as<00:05:56.640> you<00:05:56.730> can<00:05:56.880> see<00:05:57.030> I've<00:05:57.150> filled<00:05:57.570> it

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 
quickly as you can see I've filled it

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.700 
quickly as you can see I've filled it

with my lava rock grow medium I rinsed
it<00:06:01.830> quite<00:06:02.010> a<00:06:02.040> bit<00:06:02.250> and<00:06:02.400> then<00:06:02.520> put<00:06:02.670> it<00:06:02.790> in<00:06:02.910> it

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
it quite a bit and then put it in it

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.430 
it quite a bit and then put it in it
seems<00:06:03.390> to<00:06:03.570> be<00:06:03.690> alright

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 
seems to be alright

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.370 
seems to be alright
in<00:06:05.040> terms<00:06:05.310> of<00:06:05.520> not<00:06:06.300> making<00:06:06.600> my<00:06:06.870> water<00:06:07.110> too

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 
in terms of not making my water too

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.900 
in terms of not making my water too
nasty<00:06:07.940> it<00:06:08.940> is<00:06:09.060> a<00:06:09.090> little<00:06:09.330> bit<00:06:09.480> cloudy<00:06:10.070> but<00:06:11.070> you

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:11.910 
nasty it is a little bit cloudy but you

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.900 
nasty it is a little bit cloudy but you
can<00:06:12.090> still<00:06:12.890> and<00:06:13.890> still<00:06:14.130> sorta<00:06:14.430> see<00:06:14.580> down<00:06:14.730> there

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 
can still and still sorta see down there

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.500 
can still and still sorta see down there
so<00:06:16.010> anyway<00:06:17.010> hopefully<00:06:17.580> that'll<00:06:17.790> be<00:06:18.060> okay<00:06:18.390> I'm

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:18.510 
so anyway hopefully that'll be okay I'm

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:19.970 
so anyway hopefully that'll be okay I'm
gonna<00:06:18.630> let<00:06:18.780> it<00:06:18.810> set<00:06:19.230> a<00:06:19.260> little<00:06:19.410> bit<00:06:19.590> more<00:06:19.770> and

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:19.980 
gonna let it set a little bit more and

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.590 
gonna let it set a little bit more and
run<00:06:20.130> for<00:06:20.340> a<00:06:20.370> little<00:06:20.460> longer<00:06:20.670> before<00:06:21.000> I<00:06:21.240> add<00:06:21.390> any

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 
run for a little longer before I add any

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.090 
run for a little longer before I add any
fish<00:06:21.900> but<00:06:23.720> yeah<00:06:24.720> it<00:06:25.050> seems<00:06:25.320> to<00:06:25.500> be<00:06:25.680> finally

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.100 
fish but yeah it seems to be finally

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.150 
fish but yeah it seems to be finally
working<00:06:26.370> reliably<00:06:27.000> and<00:06:27.470> all<00:06:28.470> my<00:06:28.740> concerns

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.160 
working reliably and all my concerns

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.690 
working reliably and all my concerns
before<00:06:29.400> have<00:06:29.730> been<00:06:29.850> resolved<00:06:30.390> I<00:06:31.700> probably

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:32.700 
before have been resolved I probably

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.210 
before have been resolved I probably
will<00:06:33.060> get<00:06:33.330> a<00:06:33.360> little<00:06:33.570> bit<00:06:33.690> more<00:06:33.930> grow<00:06:34.560> medium<00:06:34.950> I

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:35.220 
will get a little bit more grow medium I

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.700 
will get a little bit more grow medium I
think<00:06:35.940> I'll<00:06:36.060> probably<00:06:36.150> get<00:06:36.510> some<00:06:36.720> river<00:06:37.440> rock

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:37.710 
think I'll probably get some river rock

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.710 
think I'll probably get some river rock
or<00:06:38.010> something<00:06:38.340> smaller<00:06:38.790> and<00:06:39.090> smoother<00:06:39.540> than

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720 
or something smaller and smoother than

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.750 
or something smaller and smoother than
this<00:06:39.900> stuff<00:06:40.140> and<00:06:40.560> just<00:06:40.950> kind<00:06:41.160> of<00:06:41.190> pour<00:06:41.400> that<00:06:41.580> on

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:41.760 
this stuff and just kind of pour that on

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.060 
this stuff and just kind of pour that on
top<00:06:42.140> it'll<00:06:43.140> give<00:06:43.320> me<00:06:43.470> a<00:06:43.500> little<00:06:43.680> more<00:06:43.860> height

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.070 
top it'll give me a little more height

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:47.750 
top it'll give me a little more height
which<00:06:44.340> I<00:06:44.490> think<00:06:44.700> I<00:06:44.820> need<00:06:46.100> to<00:06:47.100> micro<00:06:47.430> medium

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:47.760 
which I think I need to micro medium

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.420 
which I think I need to micro medium
compared<00:06:48.450> to<00:06:48.540> my<00:06:48.660> water<00:06:48.870> level<00:06:49.170> and<00:06:50.160> it'll

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:50.430 
compared to my water level and it'll

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.160 
compared to my water level and it'll
also<00:06:50.520> be<00:06:50.850> a<00:06:50.880> little<00:06:51.030> bit<00:06:51.120> easier<00:06:51.450> to<00:06:51.510> work<00:06:51.750> with

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:52.170 
also be a little bit easier to work with

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:55.280 
also be a little bit easier to work with
because<00:06:53.010> this<00:06:53.250> stuff's<00:06:53.520> kind<00:06:53.700> of<00:06:54.200> you<00:06:55.200> know

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:55.290 
because this stuff's kind of you know

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.520 
because this stuff's kind of you know
nasty<00:06:55.710> big<00:06:56.010> and<00:06:56.310> rough<00:06:56.730> and<00:06:57.060> I<00:06:57.300> don't<00:06:58.200> know<00:06:58.350> how

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:58.530 
nasty big and rough and I don't know how

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.620 
nasty big and rough and I don't know how
I'm<00:06:58.620> gonna<00:06:58.770> get<00:06:59.160> my<00:06:59.220> seeds<00:06:59.610> nicely<00:07:00.150> nestled<00:07:00.510> in

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:00.630 
I'm gonna get my seeds nicely nestled in

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.260 
I'm gonna get my seeds nicely nestled in
it<00:07:00.780> so<00:07:01.050> anyway<00:07:01.590> that's<00:07:02.430> the<00:07:02.640> minor<00:07:02.820> thing<00:07:03.120> I'll

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:03.270 
it so anyway that's the minor thing I'll

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:04.790 
it so anyway that's the minor thing I'll
probably<00:07:03.450> do<00:07:03.690> is<00:07:03.840> buy<00:07:04.050> a<00:07:04.080> couple<00:07:04.410> bags<00:07:04.560> of

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 
probably do is buy a couple bags of

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.610 
probably do is buy a couple bags of
river<00:07:05.400> rock<00:07:05.610> and<00:07:05.880> just<00:07:06.000> dump<00:07:06.210> that<00:07:06.270> in<00:07:06.620> but

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:07.620 
river rock and just dump that in but

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:13.040 
river rock and just dump that in but
yeah<00:07:08.430> that's<00:07:08.670> it<00:07:08.900> pretty<00:07:09.900> happy<00:07:11.780> my<00:07:12.780> next

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.050 
yeah that's it pretty happy my next

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:16.050 
I should have fish in it and maybe a

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:18.650
