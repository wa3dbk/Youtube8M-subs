 with a boy named brian forbes 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.090

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.959
 Naturally not just the whole thing 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.480
 associated with the guards nick not really want 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.650

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.470
 he has no money for him 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:22.439
 really needed and take them no where he served 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:28.470
 in the army on him from there kicked out and over 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:31.670
 bastard martinus that's how you see with us 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.670
 the cops are already pasturing 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:42.200
 Let records grieve someone so 2 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:44.710
 correct vocals and under it was on the corpse rake 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.710
 infix 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.740
 notice how about this 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.270
 the mission 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:08.090
 even after painting the truck stayed 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:11.170
 certainly not the truck wagon that was 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.970
 same color meaning he stayed white 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.820
 it is not clear why we need now 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.340
 drive north 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:21.650
 if ain is negotiable if you suddenly 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.050
 confused and did not understand where they took 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.420
 go look at the radar does not Venka 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.180
 m letter which will give radar not 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:33.110
 items misses and get to it 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:37.100
 you ca nâ€™t really be me going 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:40.120
 but this letter means north or norse 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:43.190
 in English in some translations and he 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.290
 carried away but not always so 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.440
 but if you play with translation from 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:50.240
 d &amp; g ron or whatever the call is right 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.550
 this period how much would I 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.550
 played there will be you have a letter s here 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.270
 letter n will make out in general I am yes but you 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:01.509
 have guessed 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:08.620
 and now we are driving away from the letter there 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:11.300
 docks and basically everything is just there 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:14.240
 there is where to go close 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:17.500
 painting so that the place is good very 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.500
 it's good to go 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:26.590
 here you're just trying on the docks and 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:29.350
 here is this part of the southern part of wai city 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:32.750
 everything happens here 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:35.960
 has of course guys persuade hector 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:38.270

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.120
 well 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.820
 measurement will be like he will give only three 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.890
 the star to write that strange kapanina 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:49.190
 aggressive stand that is with whom you have 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:52.010
 was out of mission three stars they 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:55.120
 They behaved aggressively and a lot but 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:58.900
 aggressive I'm here this one right on it 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.900
 hang long 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:13.850
 soul sounded ok ok pushes in general not 

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:16.180
 in the back of the van and in general 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.740
 there are some cops here 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:21.050
 missing in this place is not that 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:29.420
 quite but they become much smaller 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:30.740
 out there you only have one star with these 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.540
 these are strange phrases 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:36.600
 state lands it 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:42.500
