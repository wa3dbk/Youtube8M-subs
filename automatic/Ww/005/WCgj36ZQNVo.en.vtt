fingers like this and just cut down so

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.110 
fingers like this and just cut down so
then<00:01:16.979> you're<00:01:17.100> just<00:01:17.130> going<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.520> repeat<00:01:17.729> this

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.120 
then you're just going to repeat this

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.210 
then you're just going to repeat this
process<00:01:18.180> till<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.080> go<00:01:19.260> all<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.590> way<00:01:19.830> around

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
process till you go all the way around

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.450 
process till you go all the way around
the<00:01:20.760> head<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.350> if<00:01:22.350> they<00:01:22.680> can't<00:01:23.010> lean<00:01:23.220> their

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
the head and if they can't lean their

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.640 
the head and if they can't lean their
head<00:01:23.700> down<00:01:24.060> then<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.690> may<00:01:24.840> just<00:01:25.080> have<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.440> do

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
head down then you may just have to do

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.440 
head down then you may just have to do
like<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.220> top<00:01:26.430> half<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.850> then<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.150> bottom

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
like the top half and then the bottom

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.270 
like the top half and then the bottom
half<00:01:27.600> closer<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.229> neck<00:01:28.409> if<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:29.100> makes

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
half closer to the neck if that makes

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:38.219 
half closer to the neck if that makes
any<00:01:29.430> sense

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.810 

the<00:01:39.229> poem<00:01:39.439> is<00:01:39.469> going<00:01:39.770> to<00:01:39.829> be<00:01:39.920> very<00:01:40.219> helpful<00:01:40.549> to

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
the poem is going to be very helpful to

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.179 
the poem is going to be very helpful to
make<00:01:41.210> sure<00:01:41.509> that<00:01:41.780> your<00:01:41.929> cut<00:01:42.259> is<00:01:42.469> blending<00:01:42.979> well

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
so every time you cut just position your

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.160 
so every time you cut just position your
hand<00:01:46.069> cut<00:01:46.460> down<00:01:46.700> and<00:01:47.090> then<00:01:47.270> comb<00:01:47.539> it<00:01:47.689> out<00:01:47.840> to

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
here if you try to cut above the ear

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.160 
here if you try to cut above the ear
it's<00:01:58.189> going<00:01:58.310> to<00:01:58.490> look<00:01:58.670> patchy<00:01:58.969> choppy<00:01:59.689> and

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
it's going to look patchy choppy and

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.099 
it's going to look patchy choppy and
horrible<00:02:00.770> so<00:02:01.310> just<00:02:01.609> be<00:02:01.759> very<00:02:02.030> conservative<00:02:02.600> as

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
film too well but you're going to start

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.180 
film too well but you're going to start
off<00:02:25.910> by<00:02:25.940> doing<00:02:26.180> a<00:02:26.599> mohawk<00:02:27.110> in<00:02:27.349> the<00:02:27.500> center<00:02:27.950> and

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
off by doing a mohawk in the center and

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.180 
off by doing a mohawk in the center and
then<00:02:29.000> splitting<00:02:29.660> it<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.260> right<00:02:30.530> and<00:02:30.799> then

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
then splitting it to the right and then

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.250 
then splitting it to the right and then
to<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.489> left<00:02:31.519> of<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:32.060> mohawk<00:02:32.480> to<00:02:32.810> get<00:02:33.019> both

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
to the left of the mohawk to get both

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.110 
to the left of the mohawk to get both
sides<00:02:33.650> but<00:02:33.980> when<00:02:34.280> you<00:02:34.400> start<00:02:34.700> off<00:02:34.819> in<00:02:34.879> the

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
sides but when you start off in the

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.640 
sides but when you start off in the
center<00:02:35.329> like<00:02:35.629> that<00:02:35.660> it's<00:02:35.959> going<00:02:36.170> to<00:02:36.260> give<00:02:36.530> you

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
center like that it's going to give you

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.650 
center like that it's going to give you
your<00:02:36.769> reference<00:02:37.280> point<00:02:37.579> for<00:02:37.910> how<00:02:38.090> short<00:02:38.480> you

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
your reference point for how short you

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.009 
your reference point for how short you
need<00:02:38.810> to<00:02:38.959> go<00:02:39.110> and<00:02:40.000> then<00:02:41.000> finish<00:02:41.359> off<00:02:41.540> by<00:02:41.989> just

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
need to go and then finish off by just

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.979 
need to go and then finish off by just
washing<00:02:42.709> them<00:02:43.280> like<00:02:43.940> you<00:02:44.120> would<00:02:44.150> any<00:02:44.660> bath

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
washing them like you would any bath

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.500 
washing them like you would any bath
time<00:02:45.350> I<00:02:45.709> just<00:02:46.430> found<00:02:46.579> that<00:02:46.819> by<00:02:47.000> doing<00:02:47.209> it<00:02:47.389> in

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
time I just found that by doing it in

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.140 
time I just found that by doing it in
the<00:02:47.630> sink<00:02:48.019> it<00:02:48.230> avoids<00:02:48.680> messes<00:02:49.549> and<00:02:49.880> getting

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
the sink it avoids messes and getting

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.640 
the sink it avoids messes and getting
hair<00:02:50.389> everywhere<00:02:50.840> and<00:02:51.049> it's<00:02:51.170> just<00:02:51.350> really

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
hair everywhere and it's just really

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.129 
hair everywhere and it's just really
easy<00:02:52.040> for<00:02:52.400> cleanup<00:02:52.670> and<00:02:53.090> they<00:02:53.329> have<00:02:53.599> fun<00:02:53.900> too

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:54.139 
easy for cleanup and they have fun too

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:58.390 
easy for cleanup and they have fun too
because<00:02:54.349> they<00:02:54.739> get<00:02:54.889> to<00:02:55.040> have<00:02:55.160> Pat<00:02:55.430> time<00:02:57.400> so
