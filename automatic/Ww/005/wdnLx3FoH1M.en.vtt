00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
the body comes off the chassis we'll

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:31.069 
the body comes off the chassis we'll
have<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.609> pop<00:01:29.880> off<00:01:30.060> these<00:01:30.240> body<00:01:30.450> clips<00:01:30.780> there's

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
have to pop off these body clips there's

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.169 
have to pop off these body clips there's
four<00:01:32.039> body<00:01:32.249> clips<00:01:32.579> we'll<00:01:32.789> go<00:01:32.850> ahead<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.090> pop

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:33.179 
four body clips we'll go ahead and pop

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:42.440 
four body clips we'll go ahead and pop
them<00:01:33.390> out<00:01:39.799> and<00:01:40.799> now<00:01:41.009> we<00:01:41.460> can<00:01:41.549> just<00:01:41.670> flip<00:01:41.909> up<00:01:41.939> on

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
them out and now we can just flip up on

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.819 
them out and now we can just flip up on
top<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:44.159> gives<00:01:44.369> us<00:01:44.520> access<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:45.439> the<00:01:46.439> inside

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
top and it gives us access to the inside

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.510 
top and it gives us access to the inside
of<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.189> car<00:01:47.399> so<00:01:47.640> this<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.689> waterproof<00:01:49.530> you

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.669 
of the car so this is a waterproof you
can<00:01:50.700> see<00:01:50.909> they<00:01:51.689> got<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.840> waterproof<00:01:52.140> receiver

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
can see they got a waterproof receiver

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:55.999 
can see they got a waterproof receiver
box<00:01:52.890> switches<00:01:53.759> waterproof<00:01:54.679> so<00:01:55.679> I'm<00:01:55.770> thinking

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
box switches waterproof so I'm thinking

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.700 
box switches waterproof so I'm thinking
been<00:01:56.100> waterproofed<00:01:57.020> even<00:01:58.020> on<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.350> motor<00:01:58.560> it

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
been waterproofed even on the motor it

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.090 
been waterproofed even on the motor it
even<00:01:58.979> says<00:01:59.219> waterproof<00:01:59.670> right<00:01:59.850> on<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.090> can<00:02:00.299> so

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
even says waterproof right on the can so

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.419 
even says waterproof right on the can so
