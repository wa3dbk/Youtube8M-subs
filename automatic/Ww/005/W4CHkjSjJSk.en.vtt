back of our brig today picked them in

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.220 
back of our brig today picked them in
probably<00:02:11.459> less<00:02:11.610> than<00:02:11.670> 20<00:02:12.060> minutes

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
probably less than 20 minutes

by doing this you'll have a maid of
course<00:04:27.290> they've<00:04:27.410> got<00:04:27.440> twenty<00:04:27.919> trees<00:04:28.250> so<00:04:28.520> I<00:04:28.580> got

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
course they've got twenty trees so I got

I do that and I started though like

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.379 
I do that and I started though like

buying an apple tree back in 79 and

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 
years good years bad years I can't ever

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:23.800 
years good years bad years I can't ever
remember<00:05:21.530> a<00:05:22.280> year<00:05:22.850> when<00:05:23.030> we<00:05:23.210> were<00:05:23.330> totally

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
remember a year when we were totally

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.409 
remember a year when we were totally
skunked<00:05:24.500> like<00:05:25.039> a<00:05:25.280> freeze<00:05:25.850> or<00:05:26.090> something<00:05:26.330> like

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
skunked like a freeze or something like

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:27.850 
skunked like a freeze or something like
that<00:05:26.479> totally<00:05:27.080> wiped<00:05:27.289> him<00:05:27.440> out<00:05:27.530> there<00:05:27.740> may<00:05:27.830> be

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
that totally wiped him out there may be

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.490 
that totally wiped him out there may be
only<00:05:28.280> a<00:05:28.460> few<00:05:28.729> apples<00:05:29.120> on<00:05:29.240> the<00:05:29.300> tree<00:05:29.600> on<00:05:30.169> a<00:05:30.229> few

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
only a few apples on the tree on a few

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.680 
only a few apples on the tree on a few
years<00:05:30.740> but<00:05:31.310> most<00:05:31.610> of<00:05:31.789> the<00:05:31.910> years<00:05:32.150> I<00:05:32.389> think<00:05:32.450> it

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
years but most of the years I think it

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.680 
years but most of the years I think it
averages<00:05:33.139> right<00:05:33.200> out<00:05:33.560> of<00:05:33.740> 50<00:05:34.160> maybe<00:05:34.639> 60<00:05:34.970> pounds

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
averages right out of 50 maybe 60 pounds

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.180 
averages right out of 50 maybe 60 pounds
this<00:05:36.139> year<00:05:36.410> as<00:05:36.530> I've<00:05:36.680> said<00:05:36.889> it<00:05:37.010> was<00:05:37.100> an

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
this year as I've said it was an

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.830 
this year as I've said it was an
extra-good<00:05:37.460> year<00:05:37.820> probably<00:05:38.120> over<00:05:38.510> a<00:05:38.539> hundred

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
extra-good year probably over a hundred

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.020 
extra-good year probably over a hundred
pounds<00:05:39.020> of<00:05:39.349> apples<00:05:39.500> that<00:05:39.740> we<00:05:39.919> got<00:05:40.130> and<00:05:40.849> so

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.030 
pounds of apples that we got and so

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.870 
pounds of apples that we got and so
needless<00:05:41.419> say<00:05:41.810> this<00:05:42.289> is<00:05:42.470> one<00:05:42.740> thing<00:05:42.979> we<00:05:43.310> do<00:05:43.580> and

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
needless say this is one thing we do and

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.610 
needless say this is one thing we do and
I<00:05:44.150> think<00:05:44.630> it's<00:05:44.810> something<00:05:45.050> you<00:05:45.200> should

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
I think it's something you should

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.810 
I think it's something you should
consider<00:05:46.300> rate<00:05:47.300> this<00:05:47.510> film
