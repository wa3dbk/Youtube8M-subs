00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:26.000
 hello welcome on this occasion we are going to 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.100
 prepare a very rich mango sauce 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.870
 easy and with very few ingredients 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:36.710
 I hope you like the recipe 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:39.830
 five controls that can be any 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:43.410
 mango type I this time I'm 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:45.560
 using a creole mango 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.130
 and we are going to occupy 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.510
 Chipotle pepper 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:55.699
 a pinch of salt 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:59.739
 a cup of olive oil sugar and 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:03.019
 half a cup of water, let's start 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:05.360
 We are going to peel, but you like them more, not 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:08.690
 be a potato potatoes I come I am going to use 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.390
 a knife for me is easier and 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.590
 I feel it's a cleaner way 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:17.409
 we started with the back of the 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.409
 mango what is the trick 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:26.780
 we peel mango 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.780
 it's very simple really 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.299
 great science 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.180
 this recipe is good father because the 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.970
 can combine with many things and a 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.400
 Once it's done 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.830
 if they have something like that fast 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.190
 food then some smoked chops with 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.690
 a salsita of mangoes are very well ok 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.190
 here we are going to 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.310
 is peeling the only thing we're going to do 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.439
 is to withdraw 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.710
 Mango meat does not have to be 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:00.079
 perfectly cut does not have to be 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.720
 in small pieces it is not necessary 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:05.750
 because later we are going to liquefy it 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.750
 if it's just to cook more 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.510
 fast since we have peeled the mangoes 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.030
 the five pieces of the mango is one thing 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.670
 very important the handle does not have to 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.060
 be sweet because anyway the 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.250
 recipe carries sugar but if you have to 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.970
 be a mature mango then in a 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.970
 pan here I have my pan 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.970
 Non-stick 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.959
 let's take the mango already chopped 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.190
 the cup of sugar 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.190
 cup and a half of water 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:57.150
 right here , let's take a spoonful 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:02.100
 of olive oil as see is very 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:03.810
 simple everything goes to the skillet pan to 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.270
 the blender 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.940
 a little bit of salt has been like a 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.760
 pinch of salt salt serves us to 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.489
 two things helps us to intensify the 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.739
 flavor of the mango and to make it a 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.140
 kind of conservative so our sauce 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.120
 It can last us a little longer 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.750
 since this is what we are going to take to 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.480
 fire until it is consumed most 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.400
 more than you can water you go 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.650
 doing with a kind of jam and 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.920
 that our mango was cooked I'm going to 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.459
 teach more or less 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.739
 it evaporated like half the water if we 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.360
 something is left if I quote it here but neither 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.190
 we are completely thick 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.880
 We need you to have some liquid 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:49.640
 to liquefy it because if not then 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.250
 we will be as if it were this 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.670
 baby porridge and it really is not what 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.670
 What we want 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.710
 they spend all the same time 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.280
 our best 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:20.799
 At the end of our recipe I 'm going to give you 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:23.430
 another another option with which they can 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:26.970
 serve mango sauce 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.930
 what is something that has taken me out of 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.720
 many troubles 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:36.830
 and really people like it 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:41.170
 I hope I hope it's from your 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.170
 ok a bit of the best 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.370
 the rest 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:04.560
 type 3 there are people who do not eat spicy 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:07.599
 but you can skip this step or 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.520
 you can put it without liquefying it 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:12.310
 I like liquefied because he does not like it 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.349
 that you feel that the pieces and like 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.500
 so that without incorporating a little 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:16.500
 plus 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:23.190
 then let's put 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.190
 a single chipotle chili 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.600
 to put more blender 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.760
 remember that it is hot 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:38.240
 so that it will not jump 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.240
 they float on the face 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.840
 ah 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.820
 completely liquefied 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:15.350
 let's move on 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.350
 to a container 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:23.090
 the rich one is left 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.740
 It is thick but not like porridge and 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.520
 neither is it watered down because we are not 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.520
 making a smoothie 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:39.120
 okay 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:40.490
 we have a piece of Philadelphia cheese 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.009
 yes 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.620
 this really if they have a meeting and 

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:47.260
 They do not know 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:51.010
 It is very easy to make a snack because 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:53.800
 you have your sauce ready 

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:56.610
 mango then grab your piece of cheese 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.610
 philadelphia 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.849
 Mango Sauce 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:06.699
 over this rhythm you see 

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.350
 it's something simple 

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.630
 caritas 

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:34.850
 and we already have the snack and a sauce 

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:38.240
