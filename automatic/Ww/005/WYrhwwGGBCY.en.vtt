00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.830 
string we have the 13th fret and then
we've<00:04:28.620> got<00:04:28.680> the<00:04:28.830> 12th<00:04:29.220> fret<00:04:29.400> on<00:04:29.460> the<00:04:29.580> E<00:04:29.699> string

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
we've got the 12th fret on the E string

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.150 
we've got the 12th fret on the E string
and<00:04:30.840> we're<00:04:30.930> going<00:04:31.050> to<00:04:31.080> go<00:04:32.030> like<00:04:33.030> that<00:04:33.949> so<00:04:34.949> so

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
and we're going to go like that so so

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:43.430 
and we're going to go like that so so
far<00:04:35.400> we<00:04:35.580> have<00:04:42.020> doesn't<00:04:43.020> matter<00:04:43.139> if<00:04:43.230> you<00:04:43.290> hit

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
far we have doesn't matter if you hit

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.140 
far we have doesn't matter if you hit
two<00:04:43.710> strings<00:04:44.010> together<00:04:44.190> necessarily<00:04:44.910> as<00:04:45.000> long

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
two strings together necessarily as long

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.140 
two strings together necessarily as long
as<00:04:45.210> they<00:04:45.300> all<00:04:45.449> do<00:04:45.600> ring<00:04:45.840> out<00:04:46.220> like<00:04:47.220> that<00:04:47.430> and

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
as they all do ring out like that and

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.180 
as they all do ring out like that and
then<00:04:48.360> we're<00:04:48.480> going<00:04:48.570> to<00:04:48.630> go<00:04:48.750> back<00:04:49.020> down<00:04:49.290> to<00:04:49.590> the

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
then we're going to go back down to the

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.610 
then we're going to go back down to the
a<00:04:50.460> minor<00:04:50.880> shape<00:04:51.210> there<00:04:51.510> and<00:04:51.780> to<00:04:52.320> make<00:04:52.500> this

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
a minor shape there and to make this

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.670 
a minor shape there and to make this
easier<00:04:52.949> to<00:04:53.070> plyo<00:04:53.280> playing<00:04:53.699> like<00:04:53.880> this

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
easier to plyo playing like this

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.050 
easier to plyo playing like this
that's<00:04:55.680> the<00:04:55.800> way<00:04:55.919> I<00:04:55.949> play<00:04:56.100> it<00:04:56.370> but<00:04:56.580> you<00:04:56.940> can

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
that's the way I play it but you can

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.670 
that's the way I play it but you can
play<00:04:57.240> it<00:04:57.300> however<00:04:57.449> you<00:04:57.660> like<00:04:57.720> and<00:04:58.440> what<00:04:58.560> we're

doing here 7th fret a 7th fret D fifth
fret<00:05:03.270> G<00:05:06.530> again<00:05:07.530> it's<00:05:07.650> the<00:05:07.740> first<00:05:07.980> part<00:05:08.160> using

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
fret G again it's the first part using

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.549 
fret G again it's the first part using
the

00:05:10.549 --> 00:05:10.559

Ino - like that starting off in your
reading<00:05:12.989> out<00:05:13.109> there<00:05:13.379> but<00:05:13.799> it's<00:05:13.919> part<00:05:14.159> of<00:05:14.309> the<00:05:14.399> a

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:18.359 
minor chord and benefit broto as well I

00:05:18.359 --> 00:05:21.319 
minor chord and benefit broto as well I
tend<00:05:19.049> to<00:05:19.079> go<00:05:19.429> just<00:05:20.429> do<00:05:20.579> that<00:05:20.699> one<00:05:20.879> there<00:05:21.119> you

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:21.329 
tend to go just do that one there you

00:05:21.329 --> 00:05:25.099 
tend to go just do that one there you
can<00:05:21.479> do<00:05:22.009> we<00:05:23.009> can<00:05:23.189> play<00:05:23.369> it<00:05:23.869> however<00:05:24.869> you<00:05:24.989> want

can do we can play it however you want

00:05:25.109 --> 00:05:28.309 
can do we can play it however you want
but<00:05:25.619> I<00:05:25.679> tend<00:05:25.979> to<00:05:26.039> go<00:05:26.329> just<00:05:27.329> vibrato<00:05:27.659> that<00:05:27.899> last

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:28.319 
but I tend to go just vibrato that last

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:31.399 
but I tend to go just vibrato that last
note<00:05:29.419> now<00:05:30.419> that<00:05:30.449> way<00:05:30.749> it<00:05:30.869> doesn't<00:05:31.109> just<00:05:31.259> say

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:31.409 
note now that way it doesn't just say

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:33.319 
note now that way it doesn't just say
wring<00:05:31.679> out<00:05:31.829> those<00:05:32.039> bottom<00:05:32.459> two<00:05:32.609> notes<00:05:32.639> so<00:05:33.209> if

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:33.329 
wring out those bottom two notes so if

00:05:33.329 --> 00:05:37.879 
wring out those bottom two notes so if
you<00:05:33.449> can<00:05:33.659> play<00:05:33.899> it<00:05:34.019> like<00:05:34.109> that<00:05:36.349> may<00:05:37.349> sound<00:05:37.559> even

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:37.889 
you can play it like that may sound even

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:39.259 
you can play it like that may sound even
better<00:05:37.919> I'm<00:05:38.549> just<00:05:38.759> sort<00:05:38.879> of<00:05:38.909> like<00:05:39.029> teaching

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:39.269 
better I'm just sort of like teaching

00:05:39.269 --> 00:05:41.209 
better I'm just sort of like teaching
you<00:05:39.569> the<00:05:39.839> different<00:05:40.259> teaching<00:05:40.739> of<00:05:40.859> notes<00:05:41.039> and

00:05:41.209 --> 00:05:41.219 
you the different teaching of notes and

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:43.669 
you the different teaching of notes and
different<00:05:41.339> ways<00:05:41.609> you<00:05:41.909> can<00:05:42.119> play<00:05:42.179> it<00:05:42.569> so<00:05:43.199> so<00:05:43.439> far

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:43.679 
different ways you can play it so so far

00:05:43.679 --> 00:05:55.819 
different ways you can play it so so far
we<00:05:43.889> have<00:05:51.529> okay<00:05:52.529> ork<00:05:52.799> and<00:05:54.019> then<00:05:55.019> it<00:05:55.139> ends<00:05:55.559> up<00:05:55.649> by

00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:55.829 
we have okay ork and then it ends up by

00:05:55.829 --> 00:05:59.509 
we have okay ork and then it ends up by
going<00:05:56.069> like<00:05:56.159> this<00:05:58.279> using<00:05:59.279> all<00:05:59.399> those

00:05:59.509 --> 00:05:59.519 
going like this using all those

00:05:59.519 --> 00:06:03.619 
going like this using all those
techniques<00:06:00.089> again<00:06:00.739> so<00:06:01.739> we're<00:06:02.459> going<00:06:02.609> to<00:06:02.729> lower

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:03.629 
techniques again so we're going to lower

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:11.929 
techniques again so we're going to lower
a<00:06:04.669> minor<00:06:05.669> okay<00:06:09.589> so<00:06:10.589> we<00:06:10.739> get<00:06:10.799> a<00:06:10.859> slide<00:06:11.129> g-string

00:06:11.929 --> 00:06:11.939 
a minor okay so we get a slide g-string

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:14.589 
a minor okay so we get a slide g-string
fifth<00:06:12.209> to<00:06:12.359> seventh<00:06:12.859> like<00:06:13.859> that<00:06:14.039> again

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:14.599 
fifth to seventh like that again

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:17.239 
fifth to seventh like that again
bringing<00:06:15.599> your<00:06:15.839> finger<00:06:16.110> off<00:06:16.259> the<00:06:16.319> g-string

00:06:17.239 --> 00:06:17.249 
bringing your finger off the g-string

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:20.449 
bringing your finger off the g-string
and<00:06:17.579> then<00:06:18.389> slapping<00:06:18.989> it<00:06:19.110> quite<00:06:19.619> hard<00:06:19.829> up<00:06:20.129> with

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:20.459 
and then slapping it quite hard up with

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:25.969 
and then slapping it quite hard up with
on<00:06:21.209> the<00:06:21.360> upstroke<00:06:21.869> with<00:06:22.679> your<00:06:23.039> plectrum<00:06:24.979> then

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:25.979 
on the upstroke with your plectrum then

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:27.529 
on the upstroke with your plectrum then
we're<00:06:26.069> gonna<00:06:26.159> go<00:06:26.279> down<00:06:26.459> to<00:06:26.579> the<00:06:26.699> seventh<00:06:27.179> fret

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:27.539 
we're gonna go down to the seventh fret

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:31.850 
we're gonna go down to the seventh fret
of<00:06:27.839> the<00:06:27.899> d-string<00:06:30.199> again<00:06:31.199> all<00:06:31.349> the<00:06:31.499> time<00:06:31.679> that

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 
of the d-string again all the time that

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:40.399 
of the d-string again all the time that
same<00:06:32.099> technique<00:06:36.889> play<00:06:37.889> how<00:06:38.069> if<00:06:38.189> you<00:06:38.279> like<00:06:39.409> and

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:40.409 
same technique play how if you like and

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:43.519 
same technique play how if you like and
then<00:06:40.559> finishing<00:06:40.979> off<00:06:41.069> with<00:06:41.129> it<00:06:41.689> like<00:06:42.689> that<00:06:42.749> so

00:06:43.519 --> 00:06:43.529 
then finishing off with it like that so

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:47.629 
then finishing off with it like that so
that<00:06:43.679> last<00:06:43.829> bit<00:06:44.159> goes<00:06:45.379> seventh<00:06:46.379> fret<00:06:46.709> on<00:06:46.979> the

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:47.639 
that last bit goes seventh fret on the

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:54.799 
that last bit goes seventh fret on the
d-string<00:06:47.999> put<00:06:48.569> off<00:06:48.689> to<00:06:48.989> the<00:06:49.169> fifth<00:06:49.709> fret<00:06:53.809> like

00:06:54.799 --> 00:06:54.809 
d-string put off to the fifth fret like

00:06:54.809 --> 00:06:59.119 
d-string put off to the fifth fret like
that<00:06:55.669> okay<00:06:56.669> and<00:06:57.089> finishing<00:06:57.929> off<00:06:58.139> on<00:06:58.469> the

00:06:59.119 --> 00:06:59.129 
that okay and finishing off on the

00:06:59.129 --> 00:07:02.119 
that okay and finishing off on the
seventh<00:06:59.609> fret<00:06:59.879> of<00:07:00.149> the<00:07:00.209> a<00:07:00.479> string<00:07:00.799> so<00:07:01.799> the<00:07:01.949> last

00:07:02.119 --> 00:07:02.129 
seventh fret of the a string so the last

00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:09.619 
seventh fret of the a string so the last
bit<00:07:02.369> goes<00:07:04.459> all<00:07:05.459> those<00:07:05.639> sloppy<00:07:06.029> things<00:07:08.539> so<00:07:09.539> you

00:07:09.619 --> 00:07:09.629 
bit goes all those sloppy things so you

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:11.599 
bit goes all those sloppy things so you
put<00:07:09.809> all<00:07:10.019> those<00:07:10.349> bits<00:07:10.649> together<00:07:10.829> and<00:07:11.309> we<00:07:11.429> have

00:07:11.599 --> 00:07:11.609 
put all those bits together and we have

00:07:11.609 --> 00:07:23.230
