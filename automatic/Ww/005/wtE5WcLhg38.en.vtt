00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
kind of easier to just do than explain

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.350 
kind of easier to just do than explain
but<00:01:03.719> in<00:01:04.290> essence<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.860> just<00:01:05.129> bring<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.240> yarn

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.399 
around in a loop and then you pull that
back<00:01:08.189> strand<00:01:08.549> through<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.210> then<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:10.200> got<00:01:10.380> a

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
back strand through and then you got a

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.660 
back strand through and then you got a
little<00:01:10.680> slip<00:01:10.860> knot<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.159> put<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.490> on<00:01:11.640> a

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
needle I guess that would be

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.420 
needle I guess that would be
counterclockwise<00:02:32.940> and<00:02:33.950> then<00:02:34.950> you<00:02:35.100> take<00:02:35.280> the

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
it up and over the needlepoint take your

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.000 
it up and over the needlepoint take your
thumb<00:02:40.980> out<00:02:41.870> and<00:02:42.870> your<00:02:43.020> thumb<00:02:43.260> can<00:02:43.470> just<00:02:43.650> grab
