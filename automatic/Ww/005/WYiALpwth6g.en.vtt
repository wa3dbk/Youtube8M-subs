00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:03.560
 The Kieler thus outnumbered in the last ten minutes but they come 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.210
 Members can 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.679
 and heirs Bartels the connecting goal 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.679
 seven victims shot just needs 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.640
 once again give hope to KSV Holstein 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.079
 Heiko Petersen here 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:23.079
 3 before Moria to Hong Kong 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.210
 the Eaton last race 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.580
 run for five minutes 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.550
 get too 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.500
 experiment earlier 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.710
 new work of substitutes 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.840
 Fact gives up 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.950
 Patrik Borger 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.950
 yes lives in Kiel 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.770
 of course he plays for his wife li and Dr 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.500
 yes, this scene is timely on the ball 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.980
 the last ones are running 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.220
 two minutes 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.220
 Kienle throws everything forward 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.700
 but Patrick Borger now in the final stages 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.990
 much safer than must 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.260
 Klaus Thomforde 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
 with his children 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.510
 now room for St Pauli 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.510
 this is the preliminary decisions eyes ZG 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.010
 Simon Enzler 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.690
 cleverly shortened the angle 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.690
 / the ball off the foot 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.000
 It does not do any more for its team here 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.520
 then go ahead 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.790
 FC St Pauli gives this northern derby 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.250
 Total earned with 2 to 1 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.880
 Klaus Thomforde's first defeat as «bitter and coach at Holstein Kiel 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.950
 after a dedicated performance by FC St Pauli 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.950
 well deserved 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.889
 to have won by the persistent 

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:09.849
 the word 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.159
 Great and Wallis we want for the Mainz 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:16.159
 believed in itself has always worked threatening 

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:17.730
 bad Tönis 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.830
 the nice situation but that is really only a small piece 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:24.929
 Weiler again we will be such a hard way 

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:28.149
 and also he himself important global competitors of himself 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:32.199
 similar ambitions as we have the expectations because he himself in the 

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:33.049
 Federation 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:35.439
 Juve, however, is an important step for us on the 10th 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:38.949
 say no one who says St. Pauli was from Pauli is in a crisis 

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:43.099
 No we are just going to be started 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.409
 there were a lot of new arrivals I came also round 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:49.119
 she should take that for a while 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:50.939
 Minute but then go over and 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:54.099
 yes I think I hope that this was the sticking point and that was now 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.369
 really wide-breasted that's a star go 

00:02:57.369 --> 00:03:00.459
 therefore made it away 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.609
 St Pauli's first away win of the season at Pauli's first away win since then 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.959
 25 March Pauli is happy 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.569
 loses the third home game 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.979
 in Peru is indicative of our whole series so far 

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:16.349
 we just can not 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.349
 to retrieve everything in advance what we are doing 

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:23.339
 so it is on the field the gate for us too late 

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:26.779
 This is clearly how it works in football when you score a goal 

00:03:26.779 --> 00:03:29.629
 then it relieves the spasm a bit 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:32.469
 the uncertainty under which, so to speak, succeeded too late 

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:34.919
 they must now deal in the table cellar 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:37.599
 So who is that one the other already made before? 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.169
 who has defeats now years who got four points 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:43.309
 in the last games 

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:45.079
 it would be wrong 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:46.749
 dat in front of the eyes 

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:50.129
 Sander Til is interested in the open coach and sports director question 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.409
 is the answer to today's game 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:54.709
 I assume that we will make the decision next week 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.139
 to announce know to expand are negotiations 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:03:59.779
 and I think we have good solutions to serve 

00:03:59.779 --> 00:04:02.789
 So I do not comment on names yet, we have to agree completely 

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:05.089
 that there are a few things here 

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:08.209
 That's why I can not name yet but this was also an application 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:09.679
 under power 

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:11.769
 so increased I say nothing so Klaus Trumpf
