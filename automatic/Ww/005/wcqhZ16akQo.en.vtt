maybe he'll fight luis collazo and
that's<00:05:27.360> a<00:05:27.540> stretch<00:05:28.040> net<00:05:29.040> and<00:05:29.460> that's<00:05:29.970> a

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
that's a stretch net and that's a

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.340 
that's a stretch net and that's a
stretch<00:05:31.010> you<00:05:32.010> know<00:05:32.160> personally<00:05:32.940> I<00:05:33.150> think<00:05:34.050> the

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
stretch you know personally I think the

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.370 
stretch you know personally I think the
best<00:05:34.560> part<00:05:34.770> for<00:05:35.100> me<00:05:35.370> I<00:05:35.550> can't<00:05:35.910> is<00:05:36.380> adrien

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
best part for me I can't is adrien

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.620 
best part for me I can't is adrien
broner<00:05:37.680> I<00:05:37.980> think<00:05:38.430> that<00:05:38.700> is<00:05:39.000> the<00:05:39.270> best

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
broner I think that is the best

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.250 
broner I think that is the best
stylistic<00:05:40.500> matchup<00:05:41.390> that<00:05:42.390> Aamir<00:05:42.780> Khan<00:05:43.020> can

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
stylistic matchup that Aamir Khan can

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.830 
stylistic matchup that Aamir Khan can
take<00:05:43.560> right<00:05:43.860> now<00:05:44.120> you're<00:05:45.120> that<00:05:45.360> or<00:05:45.510> maybe<00:05:45.690> a

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
take right now you're that or maybe a

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.290 
take right now you're that or maybe a
Robert<00:05:46.290> Guerrero<00:05:46.550> but<00:05:47.550> I<00:05:47.610> think<00:05:47.820> ray'll<00:05:48.060> would

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
Robert Guerrero but I think ray'll would

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:54.050 
Robert Guerrero but I think ray'll would
be<00:05:48.450> his<00:05:48.600> ass<00:05:48.890> so<00:05:49.890> on<00:05:50.780> overall<00:05:51.780> I<00:05:52.610> don't<00:05:53.610> i'm<00:05:53.730> not

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
be his ass so on overall I don't i'm not

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.390 
be his ass so on overall I don't i'm not
sure<00:05:54.510> if<00:05:54.690> Adrian<00:05:55.410> Brown<00:05:55.560> want<00:05:55.920> to<00:05:56.010> take<00:05:56.190> on<00:05:56.370> a

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
sure if Adrian Brown want to take on a

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.350 
sure if Adrian Brown want to take on a
mere<00:05:56.610> kaam<00:05:56.850> but<00:05:57.180> uh<00:05:57.210> I<00:05:57.660> think<00:05:58.410> that's<00:05:58.800> one

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
mere kaam but uh I think that's one

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.010 
mere kaam but uh I think that's one
fight<00:06:00.360> that<00:06:01.280> that<00:06:02.280> you<00:06:03.240> know<00:06:03.390> it<00:06:03.600> would<00:06:03.840> be<00:06:03.870> a

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
fight that that you know it would be a

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.910 
fight that that you know it would be a
good<00:06:04.920> sell<00:06:05.310> for<00:06:05.970> sure<00:06:06.180> but<00:06:07.020> I'm<00:06:07.200> not<00:06:07.410> sure<00:06:07.440> who
