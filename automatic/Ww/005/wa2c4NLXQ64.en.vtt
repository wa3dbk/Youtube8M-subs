we're<00:00:57.750> really<00:00:57.899> interested<00:00:58.350> on<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.920> route<00:00:59.100> in

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
we're really interested on the route in

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:02.599 
we're really interested on the route in
electricity<00:01:01.109> generation<00:01:01.620> energy<00:01:02.250> generation

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
electricity generation energy generation

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.969 
electricity generation energy generation
well<00:01:03.059> it's<00:01:03.570> also<00:01:03.690> how<00:01:03.960> it's<00:01:04.140> used<00:01:04.470> which<00:01:04.799> is

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
well it's also how it's used which is

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.100 
well it's also how it's used which is
perhaps<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.400> more<00:01:05.580> important<00:01:06.030> thing<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.960> got

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
perhaps the more important thing you got

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.100 
perhaps the more important thing you got
farming<00:01:07.619> agriculture<00:01:08.490> mining<00:01:09.110> industries

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
farming agriculture mining industries

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.230 
farming agriculture mining industries
which<00:01:10.260> use<00:01:10.500> huge<00:01:10.920> quantities<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.460> energy<00:01:11.729> and

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
which use huge quantities of energy and

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.670 
which use huge quantities of energy and
the<00:01:12.510> way<00:01:12.600> they<00:01:12.780> user<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.170> going<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.380> have<00:01:13.530> to

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
the way they user is going to have to

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.929 
the way they user is going to have to
change<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.220> coming<00:01:14.490> years<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.850> we're

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
change in the coming years and we're

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.280 
change in the coming years and we're
going<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.210> do<00:01:15.299> in<00:01:15.420> visit<00:01:15.659> these<00:01:15.780> industries

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
going to do in visit these industries

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.249 
going to do in visit these industries
and<00:01:16.439> see<00:01:16.590> how<00:01:16.770> it's<00:01:17.729> almost<00:01:18.119> mainly<00:01:19.080> about

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
and see how it's almost mainly about

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.740 
and see how it's almost mainly about
education<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.159> awareness<00:01:20.400> raising<00:01:20.790> what

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
education and awareness raising what

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:22.820 
education and awareness raising what
we're<00:01:21.900> trying<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.140> do<00:01:22.320> with<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:22.560> project

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
we're trying to do with this project

they're sexy they're fast and they can

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.060 
they're sexy they're fast and they can
do<00:01:29.880> amazing<00:01:30.360> things<00:01:30.630> on<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.079> road<00:01:31.259> really<00:01:31.920> be

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
do amazing things on the road really be

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.520 
do amazing things on the road really be
all<00:01:32.100> plain<00:01:32.549> sailing<00:01:32.880> I'm<00:01:33.869> sure<00:01:34.170> will<00:01:34.350> come

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
all plain sailing I'm sure will come

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.530 
all plain sailing I'm sure will come
across<00:01:34.650> I'm<00:01:35.040> probably<00:01:35.549> daily<00:01:36.030> challenges

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
across I'm probably daily challenges

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.450 
across I'm probably daily challenges
which<00:01:37.049> hopefully<00:01:37.320> will<00:01:37.590> be<00:01:37.650> able<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:38.100> surmount

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
which hopefully will be able to surmount

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.910 
which hopefully will be able to surmount
when<00:01:38.880> one<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.299> my<00:01:39.390> concerns<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:40.079> if<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.799> look

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
when one of my concerns is if you look

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.710 
when one of my concerns is if you look
at<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.070> car<00:01:41.280> obviously<00:01:41.460> like<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.479> ride

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
at the car obviously like the ride

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.270 
at the car obviously like the ride
height<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:43.200> pretty<00:01:43.470> low<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:44.009> know<00:01:44.130> we're

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
height is pretty low you know we're

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.100 
height is pretty low you know we're
talking<00:01:44.579> about<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:45.030> cup<00:01:45.420> couple<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:45.960> inches

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
talking about a cup couple of inches

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.679 
talking about a cup couple of inches
three<00:01:46.560> inches<00:01:46.590> there<00:01:47.430> so<00:01:47.880> we<00:01:48.270> need<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.509> raise

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
three inches there so we need to raise

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
that up a little bit we're going to be

to learn exactly at the same speed so we

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.170
