00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.860
Hello everybody, I’m Sonia… Welcome to my YouTube channel.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:17.960
I decided to start this personal project because I really had nothing else to do on my summer break

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.900
So, I said… I should create a YouTube channel, great idea!

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:29.700
In this video I won’t show how to do your make up, make cute hairstyles, or bake fitness desserts.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.700
I would like to share with you some tips to be happier.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.700
But, why happier?

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.000
Well, because there’s always going to be a person like this...

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.760
A happy person

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.880
Honestly, I am very happy. I love my family and they love me.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.560
I’m always tanned. I eat tons of empanadas and never get fat. I couldn’t be happier.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.080
I don’t believe you!

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:03.140
I’m sure eventually people need a little push to improve their day

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.640
Let’s begin! Tip #1

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.060
Laugh at yourself

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.460
Don’t take life too seriously. Try to enjoy your flaws.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.120
At the end, people is more focused about what others think about them,

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.600
Rather than what they think about you, or she about someone else… how is it?

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.880
I thought that she told you that her mom said that I was too ridiculous...

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.700
Because I was doing YouTube videos about how to make people happier. What is this??? No, no.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.800
Tip #2. Exercise!

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.820
If you already exercise regularly, congratulations! You’re a fitness person.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.160
But… For those who don’t…

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.600
Go out and do any type of exercise! Frog jumps, a YouTube Zumba class… My favorite!

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.880
Anything that helps you move your body will make you feel way better.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.540
Your body will release endorphins and you will feel motivated instantly.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.860
Tip #3. Live in the present.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:06.540
With this advice I don’t mean that you should go right now to the nearest casino and waste all your money.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.900
Live of the present!... Live of the present...?

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:16.720
It’s all about living in the present and focus about what’s going on here and now.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.520
Well, not here... here. But, you know what I mean!

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.540
Focusing on what’s going on and enjoy it as it is, without worrying about what happened or will happen.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.620
I’m 30 years old and don’t have a boyfriend, not even an admired.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.760
I don’t want to be single forever. I’m going right now to the plastic surgeon doctor.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.420
Enjoying the smallest things will make you happier.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.360
So, appreciate what you have today because you don’t know when it will be gone

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.360
Tip #4.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.360
Be thankful.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.280
That is to say, don’t be ungrateful!

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:59.060
There is people praying for what you take for granted every day. So, try to see the big picture.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.780
You probably don’t have a job and have a huge debt to pay.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.380
But I am sure you have two legs and two little hands to get another job.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.380
Appreciate also…

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.780
Appreciate not only what you have but the opportunities that life has given to you.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.280
And only you know what they are. Or maybe not…

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.020
And finally, tip #5.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:27.600
Purchase immediately the magic product for instant happiness.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.880
I have to confess I found an amazing product.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.420
Just one teaspoon and that’s it. You’ll be happy for the rest of the day.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.080
But you have to be very careful because it’s too addictive...

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.500
...and I think I crossed the line of the addiction.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:51.000
Shame on you! Making people who are on a diet wanting to buy a Nutella jar!

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.760
Well, at least I advise them to exercise… So, stop complaining. Come on! Be thankful for the little advices!
