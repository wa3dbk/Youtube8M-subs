running<00:02:06.149> up<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.479> right<00:02:07.409> now<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.619> can<00:02:07.890> see<00:02:08.039> on

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
running up to right now you can see on

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.490 
running up to right now you can see on
the<00:02:08.250> left<00:02:08.459> side<00:02:08.700> we<00:02:08.910> have<00:02:08.940> fr<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:09.959> which<00:02:10.229> means

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
the left side we have fr a which means

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.559 
the left side we have fr a which means
frames<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.129> then

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
frames and then

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.770 
frames and then
for<00:02:11.900> right<00:02:12.409> now<00:02:12.439> we're<00:02:12.739> rendering<00:02:13.629> right<00:02:14.629> at

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
for right now we're rendering right at

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.679 
for right now we're rendering right at
about<00:02:14.930> a<00:02:14.959> hundred<00:02:15.140> frames<00:02:15.590> now<00:02:15.889> and<00:02:16.689> it's

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:17.689 
about a hundred frames now and it's

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:19.300 
about a hundred frames now and it's
moving<00:02:17.900> pretty<00:02:18.109> fast<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:18.650> this<00:02:18.709> is<00:02:18.859> a<00:02:18.889> good

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
moving pretty fast and this is a good

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.309 
moving pretty fast and this is a good
size<00:02:19.549> for<00:02:19.909> this<00:02:19.969> particular<00:02:20.239> project<00:02:20.870> so<00:02:20.900> you

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
size for this particular project so you

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.440 
size for this particular project so you
don't<00:02:21.889> have<00:02:22.249> to<00:02:22.430> wait<00:02:22.579> too<00:02:22.819> long<00:02:22.969> for<00:02:23.359> the

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
don't have to wait too long for the

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.729 
don't have to wait too long for the
rendering<00:02:23.840> process<00:02:25.840> okay<00:02:26.840> so<00:02:27.290> it'll<00:02:27.469> be<00:02:27.590> done

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
rendering process okay so it'll be done

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:28.959 
rendering process okay so it'll be done
in<00:02:27.769> a<00:02:27.889> second<00:02:28.189> here<00:02:28.340> we'll<00:02:28.459> just<00:02:28.609> watch<00:02:28.730> it

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:28.969 
in a second here we'll just watch it

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:42.050 
in a second here we'll just watch it
okay<00:02:35.230> 220<00:02:36.609> 240

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.630 

all<00:02:42.630> right<00:02:42.840> so<00:02:43.260> now<00:02:43.410> that<00:02:43.470> we're<00:02:43.680> done<00:02:43.860> what<00:02:44.520> we

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
all right so now that we're done what we

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.930 
all right so now that we're done what we
can<00:02:44.790> do<00:02:44.970> now<00:02:45.150> is<00:02:45.560> go<00:02:46.560> into<00:02:46.800> where<00:02:47.640> it<00:02:47.760> says

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
can do now is go into where it says

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.460 
can do now is go into where it says
render<00:02:48.240> and<00:02:48.540> we<00:02:48.630> can<00:02:48.780> actually<00:02:48.959> play<00:02:49.319> this

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
render and we can actually play this

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.390 
render and we can actually play this
back<00:02:51.530> okay<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:52.560> you<00:02:52.740> can<00:02:52.860> see<00:02:53.010> how<00:02:53.160> it's

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
back okay and you can see how it's

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.130 
back okay and you can see how it's
shrunk<00:02:53.700> there<00:02:53.880> that<00:02:54.030> was<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.330> scale<00:02:54.600> part

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
shrunk there that was the scale part

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.550 
shrunk there that was the scale part
okay<00:02:55.620> so<00:02:56.100> you<00:02:56.190> can<00:02:56.310> play<00:02:56.459> this<00:02:56.580> back<00:02:56.850> and<00:02:57.560> then

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
okay so you can play this back and then

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.410 
okay so you can play this back and then
you<00:02:58.860> see<00:02:59.040> I<00:02:59.069> had<00:02:59.250> a<00:02:59.280> big<00:02:59.459> pause<00:02:59.730> at<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.120> end<00:03:00.150> of

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
you see I had a big pause at the end of

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.059 
you see I had a big pause at the end of
that<00:03:00.510> that's<00:03:00.989> because<00:03:01.350> I<00:03:01.470> don't<00:03:01.530> have<00:03:01.800> any

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
that that's because I don't have any

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.580 
that that's because I don't have any
frames<00:03:02.430> in<00:03:02.610> this<00:03:02.760> part<00:03:03.060> of<00:03:03.150> it<00:03:03.270> so<00:03:03.660> what<00:03:04.560> you

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
frames in this part of it so what you

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.760 
frames in this part of it so what you
can<00:03:04.860> do<00:03:05.069> is<00:03:05.690> we<00:03:06.690> can<00:03:06.840> actually<00:03:06.989> shorten<00:03:07.650> this

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
can do is we can actually shorten this

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.490 
can do is we can actually shorten this
very<00:03:08.130> easily<00:03:08.489> if<00:03:09.090> I<00:03:09.180> say<00:03:09.450> since<00:03:09.989> I<00:03:10.140> only<00:03:10.290> have

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
very easily if I say since I only have

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.990 
very easily if I say since I only have
this<00:03:10.680> movement<00:03:11.100> at<00:03:11.160> this<00:03:11.280> point<00:03:11.580> I'm<00:03:11.790> going<00:03:11.940> to

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
this movement at this point I'm going to

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.470 
this movement at this point I'm going to
stop<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.660> rendering<00:03:13.290> at<00:03:13.530> 50<00:03:14.040> frames<00:03:14.310> okay<00:03:14.940> so

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
stop the rendering at 50 frames okay so

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.470 
stop the rendering at 50 frames okay so
go<00:03:15.750> down<00:03:15.930> here<00:03:16.350> to<00:03:17.120> where<00:03:18.120> we're<00:03:18.269> actually

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
go down here to where we're actually

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.630 
go down here to where we're actually
creating<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.350> render<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:19.709> I'll<00:03:20.040> change<00:03:20.310> this

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
creating the render and I'll change this

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.120 
creating the render and I'll change this
to<00:03:20.700> 50<00:03:22.310> all<00:03:23.310> right<00:03:23.489> so<00:03:24.090> now<00:03:24.650> I'll<00:03:25.650> render<00:03:26.010> this

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
to 50 all right so now I'll render this

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.350 
to 50 all right so now I'll render this
out<00:03:26.310> and<00:03:26.489> it<00:03:26.610> would<00:03:26.700> render<00:03:26.819> in<00:03:27.000> a<00:03:27.060> much

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
out and it would render in a much

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:38.540 
out and it would render in a much
quicker<00:03:27.569> go<00:03:27.810> is<00:03:27.900> only<00:03:28.050> going<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.319> do<00:03:28.380> 50<00:03:28.800> frames

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.880 

all<00:03:39.150> right<00:03:39.330> so<00:03:39.660> now<00:03:39.810> we're<00:03:39.990> done<00:03:40.140> so<00:03:40.680> now<00:03:40.830> we

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
all right so now we're done so now we

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.640 
all right so now we're done so now we
can<00:03:41.100> go<00:03:41.250> in<00:03:41.490> here<00:03:41.700> and<00:03:42.680> play<00:03:43.680> it<00:03:43.800> back<00:03:45.650> and

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
can go in here and play it back and

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.000 
can go in here and play it back and
there<00:03:47.190> is<00:03:47.460> our<00:03:47.640> animation

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
there is our animation

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.650 
there is our animation
okay<00:03:50.010> yours<00:03:50.310> can<00:03:50.490> be<00:03:50.580> longer<00:03:50.820> or<00:03:51.030> shorter<00:03:51.060> I

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
okay yours can be longer or shorter I

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.600 
okay yours can be longer or shorter I
think<00:03:52.230> if<00:03:52.410> you<00:03:52.590> have<00:03:52.830> more<00:03:53.160> things<00:03:53.370> that<00:03:53.460> the

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
think if you have more things that the

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.130 
think if you have more things that the
objects<00:03:53.940> in<00:03:54.060> there<00:03:54.240> I<00:03:54.390> think<00:03:54.600> it<00:03:54.930> may<00:03:55.080> be

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
objects in there I think it may be

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.080 
objects in there I think it may be
longer<00:03:55.440> you<00:03:55.710> can<00:03:55.860> use<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.220> whole<00:03:56.400> 10<00:03:56.670> seconds

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
longer you can use the whole 10 seconds

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.600 
longer you can use the whole 10 seconds
if<00:03:57.180> you<00:03:57.210> need<00:03:57.480> to<00:03:57.630> but<00:03:58.200> if<00:03:58.320> you<00:03:58.410> don't<00:03:58.650> try<00:03:59.550> to

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
if you need to but if you don't try to

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.120 
if you need to but if you don't try to
kind<00:04:00.480> of<00:04:00.570> hone<00:04:00.990> in<00:04:01.200> on<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:01.680> keyframes<00:04:02.070> you

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
kind of hone in on the keyframes you

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.040 
kind of hone in on the keyframes you
have<00:04:02.310> so<00:04:02.430> you<00:04:02.490> don't<00:04:02.610> have<00:04:02.700> a<00:04:02.730> big<00:04:02.940> empty<00:04:03.840> gap

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
have so you don't have a big empty gap

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.190 
have so you don't have a big empty gap
of<00:04:04.290> nothing<00:04:05.190> so<00:04:05.400> it<00:04:05.490> just<00:04:05.720> it's<00:04:06.720> kind<00:04:06.900> of<00:04:06.930> still

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
of nothing so it just it's kind of still

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.550 
of nothing so it just it's kind of still
at<00:04:07.350> the<00:04:07.440> end<00:04:07.560> of<00:04:07.650> it<00:04:07.740> try<00:04:08.340> to<00:04:08.400> use<00:04:08.730> or<00:04:09.290> limit<00:04:10.290> the

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
at the end of it try to use or limit the

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.610 
at the end of it try to use or limit the
amount<00:04:10.830> of<00:04:10.980> frames<00:04:11.280> that<00:04:11.490> are<00:04:11.550> being<00:04:12.620> played

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
amount of frames that are being played

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.820 
amount of frames that are being played
okay<00:04:14.250> that's<00:04:14.640> it
