for the tip to get in when the washer
was<00:02:13.260> there<00:02:13.530> so<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:14.790> just<00:02:15.570> used<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:17.060> screen<00:02:18.060> in

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
was there so I just used the screen in

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.940 
was there so I just used the screen in
the<00:02:18.450> back<00:02:18.660> as<00:02:19.650> you<00:02:19.800> can<00:02:20.190> see<00:02:20.490> I<00:02:21.260> put<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.650> screen

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.449 
the back as you can see I put the screen
in<00:02:23.220> it<00:02:23.520> was<00:02:23.670> not<00:02:23.910> an<00:02:24.630> easy<00:02:24.900> install<00:02:25.680> because

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
in it was not an easy install because

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.310 
in it was not an easy install because
the<00:02:26.580> screen<00:02:26.910> kept<00:02:27.209> falling<00:02:27.660> out<00:02:27.780> cuz<00:02:28.110> it's

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
the screen kept falling out cuz it's

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.670 
the screen kept falling out cuz it's
unattached<00:02:29.190> I<00:02:29.670> would<00:02:30.360> like<00:02:30.840> if<00:02:31.050> they<00:02:31.260> attached

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
unattached I would like if they attached

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.110 
unattached I would like if they attached
it<00:02:31.980> first

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
it first

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.720 
it first
alright<00:02:33.900> I'm<00:02:34.020> gonna<00:02:34.200> start<00:02:34.590> it<00:02:34.770> and<00:02:35.100> we'll<00:02:35.459> see

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:27.170 

I<00:03:24.260> believe<00:03:25.260> that<00:03:25.590> tip<00:03:26.250> made<00:03:26.550> the<00:03:26.760> sound<00:03:27.060> a

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
I believe that tip made the sound a

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.830 
I believe that tip made the sound a
little<00:03:27.330> better

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
little better

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.070 
little better
I<00:03:28.020> don't<00:03:28.920> know<00:03:29.010> power<00:03:29.580> increases<00:03:32.840> and<00:03:33.840> might

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
I don't know power increases and might

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.920 
I don't know power increases and might
increase<00:03:34.500> by<00:03:34.740> a<00:03:34.770> little<00:03:35.280> bit<00:03:35.460> I<00:03:36.030> don't<00:03:36.690> think

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
increase by a little bit I don't think

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.950 
increase by a little bit I don't think
it<00:03:37.320> does<00:03:37.560> much<00:03:38.060> but<00:03:39.060> it's<00:03:39.390> much<00:03:39.660> different

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960 
it does much but it's much different

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.870 
it does much but it's much different
