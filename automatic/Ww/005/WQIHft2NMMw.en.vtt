down<00:04:26.979> they<00:04:27.639> imagined<00:04:28.150> something<00:04:28.389> very<00:04:28.720> small

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
down they imagined something very small

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.440 
down they imagined something very small
maybe<00:04:29.620> the<00:04:29.800> size<00:04:30.010> of<00:04:30.160> a<00:04:30.220> dragonfly<00:04:30.760> a<00:04:31.030> target

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
maybe the size of a dragonfly a target

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.629 
maybe the size of a dragonfly a target

too small to be hit but there were

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:35.550 
too small to be hit but there were

using such a small lens they needed a

using such a small lens they needed a
bigger<00:04:40.210> lens<00:04:40.450> I<00:04:41.039> nodded<00:04:42.039> and<00:04:42.970> you<00:04:43.150> thought<00:04:43.360> of

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
bigger lens I nodded and you thought of

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.210 
bigger lens I nodded and you thought of

a swarm of nano computers

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.670 
a swarm of nano computers
that's<00:04:45.820> right<00:04:46.090> Ricky<00:04:46.750> pointed<00:04:47.110> to<00:04:47.230> the<00:04:47.350> screen

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
that's right Ricky pointed to the screen

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.920 
that's right Ricky pointed to the screen
where<00:04:47.890> a<00:04:47.920> cluster<00:04:48.340> of<00:04:48.370> black<00:04:48.730> spots<00:04:49.120> Leo<00:04:49.690> been

turned in the air like birds cloud of
components<00:04:53.200> would<00:04:53.290> allow<00:04:53.530> you<00:04:53.590> to<00:04:53.830> make<00:04:53.980> a

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
components would allow you to make a

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.830 
components would allow you to make a
camera<00:04:54.520> with<00:04:54.670> his<00:04:54.850> large<00:04:55.120> and<00:04:55.360> lenses<00:04:55.660> you

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
camera with his large and lenses you

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.750 
camera with his large and lenses you
wanted<00:04:56.230> and<00:04:56.380> it<00:04:57.010> couldn't<00:04:57.220> be<00:04:57.340> shot<00:04:57.550> down

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
wanted and it couldn't be shot down

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.280 
wanted and it couldn't be shot down
because<00:04:58.360> a<00:04:58.390> bullet<00:04:58.780> would<00:04:58.930> just<00:04:59.080> pass<00:04:59.230> right

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
because a bullet would just pass right

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.190 
because a bullet would just pass right
through<00:04:59.590> the<00:04:59.980> cloud<00:05:00.690> furthermore<00:05:01.690> you<00:05:02.080> could

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
through the cloud furthermore you could

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.080 
through the cloud furthermore you could
disperse<00:05:02.560> the<00:05:02.770> club<00:05:03.010> the<00:05:03.550> way<00:05:03.700> a<00:05:03.730> flock<00:05:04.060> of

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
disperse the club the way a flock of

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.810 
disperse the club the way a flock of
birds<00:05:04.450> disperses<00:05:05.200> with<00:05:05.350> a<00:05:05.380> gunshot<00:05:05.670> then<00:05:06.670> the

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
birds disperses with a gunshot then the

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.730 
birds disperses with a gunshot then the
camera<00:05:07.210> would<00:05:07.360> be<00:05:07.540> invisible<00:05:07.840> until<00:05:08.590> it

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
camera would be invisible until it

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.010 
camera would be invisible until it
reformed<00:05:09.160> again<00:05:09.370> so<00:05:10.120> seemed<00:05:10.390> like<00:05:10.570> the<00:05:10.720> ideal

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
reformed again so seemed like the ideal
