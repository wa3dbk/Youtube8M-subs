timbering<00:02:58.079> but<00:02:58.500> oddly<00:02:58.980> this<00:02:59.549> album<00:02:59.819> feels

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
timbering but oddly this album feels

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.459 
timbering but oddly this album feels
like<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:00.239> builds<00:03:00.510> momentum<00:03:00.659> almost<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.349> little

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:01.469 
like it builds momentum almost a little

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:03.140 
like it builds momentum almost a little
too<00:03:01.620> well<00:03:02.219> it<00:03:02.459> means<00:03:02.579> that<00:03:02.669> some<00:03:02.849> of<00:03:02.909> the<00:03:03.000> trash

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
too well it means that some of the trash

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.179 
too well it means that some of the trash
can<00:03:03.299> feel<00:03:03.480> draining<00:03:04.199> that<00:03:04.319> is<00:03:04.439> the<00:03:04.590> constant

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189 
can feel draining that is the constant

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:06.920 
can feel draining that is the constant
blaring<00:03:05.639> horns<00:03:05.969> and<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.120> energetic<00:03:06.599> high

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
blaring horns and the energetic high

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.689 
blaring horns and the energetic high
tempo<00:03:07.409> which<00:03:07.709> might<00:03:08.129> have<00:03:08.219> been<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.340> point

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:08.699 
tempo which might have been the point

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:10.729

and<00:03:51.120> look<00:03:51.659> there's<00:03:51.959> a<00:03:52.019> limit<00:03:52.319> down<00:03:52.409> which<00:03:52.590> I'm

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
and look there's a limit down which I'm

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.379 
and look there's a limit down which I'm
really<00:03:52.829> expecting<00:03:53.519> here<00:03:53.639> because<00:03:53.909> it<00:03:54.150> is<00:03:54.359> a

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.209 
really expecting here because it is a
debut<00:03:54.840> album<00:03:55.199> and<00:03:55.349> you<00:03:55.500> can<00:03:55.650> argue<00:03:55.979> that<00:03:56.009> the

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:56.219 
debut album and you can argue that the

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:57.830 
debut album and you can argue that the
instrumentation<00:03:56.699> does<00:03:57.180> enough<00:03:57.659> to

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
instrumentation does enough to

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.969 
instrumentation does enough to
distinguish<00:03:58.290> them<00:03:58.469> and<00:03:58.620> allows<00:03:58.769> them<00:03:58.949> to

00:03:58.969 --> 00:03:58.979 
distinguish them and allows them to

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:00.800 
distinguish them and allows them to
stick<00:03:59.250> a<00:03:59.430> little<00:03:59.579> bit<00:03:59.790> closer<00:04:00.030> to<00:04:00.180> formula<00:04:00.780> one
