Dam there they're responding to stimuli

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.730 
Dam there they're responding to stimuli
it's<00:01:10.250> the<00:01:10.729> sound<00:01:11.000> of<00:01:11.180> running<00:01:11.390> water<00:01:11.539> the<00:01:12.380> feel

it's the sound of running water the feel

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.090 
it's the sound of running water the feel
of<00:01:12.979> flowing<00:01:13.880> water<00:01:13.910> the<00:01:14.420> only<00:01:14.840> way<00:01:15.050> other<00:01:15.950> way

like<00:01:23.899> to<00:01:24.020> use<00:01:24.140> wood<00:01:24.470> to<00:01:24.710> build<00:01:24.860> my<00:01:25.039> fences<00:01:25.460> and

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
like to use wood to build my fences and

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.889 
like to use wood to build my fences and
try<00:01:25.789> this<00:01:25.850> if<00:01:26.090> it's<00:01:26.240> a<00:01:26.300> much<00:01:26.450> better<00:01:26.690> way<00:01:26.840> to

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
try this if it's a much better way to

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.779 
try this if it's a much better way to
build<00:01:27.200> a<00:01:27.259> frame<00:01:27.670> and<00:01:28.670> then<00:01:29.119> plastic<00:01:29.960> pipes

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
build a frame and then plastic pipes

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:34.450 
build a frame and then plastic pipes
polyethylene<00:01:31.789> pipes<00:01:32.090> just<00:01:33.009> to<00:01:34.009> keep<00:01:34.310> the

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
polyethylene pipes just to keep the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.800 
polyethylene pipes just to keep the

water away from the Beavers through

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.350 
water away from the Beavers through
we're<00:01:36.500> simply<00:01:36.799> trying<00:01:36.829> to<00:01:37.040> keep<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.180> water

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
we're simply trying to keep the water

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.210 
we're simply trying to keep the water
flowing<00:01:38.600> into<00:01:38.840> this<00:01:38.960> head<00:01:39.140> gate<00:01:39.350> all<00:01:39.530> the<00:01:39.680> time

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
flowing into this head gate all the time

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.710 
flowing into this head gate all the time
and<00:01:41.400> make<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.970> presence<00:01:42.330> of<00:01:42.420> beavers

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
and make the presence of beavers

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.050 
and make the presence of beavers
irrelevant<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:43.620> we<00:01:43.770> can<00:01:43.920> have<00:01:44.070> great<00:01:44.520> wetlands

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
irrelevant so we can have great wetlands

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.630 
irrelevant so we can have great wetlands
great<00:01:45.420> wildlife<00:01:45.810> habitats<00:01:46.380> which<00:01:46.650> benefit

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
great wildlife habitats which benefit

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.440 
great wildlife habitats which benefit
people<00:01:47.850> in<00:01:48.210> many<00:01:48.480> many<00:01:48.720> ways<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.830> also<00:01:50.190> have<00:01:50.400> a

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
people in many many ways and also have a

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.390 
people in many many ways and also have a
head<00:01:51.450> gate<00:01:51.690> and<00:01:51.960> an<00:01:52.170> irrigation<00:01:52.650> ditch<00:01:52.860> that

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
head gate and an irrigation ditch that

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.810 
head gate and an irrigation ditch that
is<00:01:53.610> reliable<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.810> flows<00:01:55.380> dependably<00:01:56.070> the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
is reliable and flows dependably the

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.420 
is reliable and flows dependably the
basic<00:01:57.360> reason<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:58.200> they<00:01:58.530> can<00:01:58.800> almost<00:01:59.040> always

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
basic reason that they can almost always

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.390 
basic reason that they can almost always
work<00:01:59.910> is<00:02:00.780> because<00:02:00.960> beavers<00:02:01.530> have<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.920> brain<00:02:02.220> the

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
work is because beavers have a brain the

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.820 
work is because beavers have a brain the
size<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.760> walnut<00:02:03.000> so<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:03.840> do<00:02:04.020> sometimes<00:02:04.740> have

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
size of a walnut so I do sometimes have

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.040 
size of a walnut so I do sometimes have
problems<00:02:04.980> is<00:02:05.640> small<00:02:06.090> beavers<00:02:06.480> pulling<00:02:06.840> stuff

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
problems is small beavers pulling stuff

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.889 
problems is small beavers pulling stuff
through<00:02:07.230> the<00:02:07.290> six<00:02:07.530> inch<00:02:07.710> by<00:02:08.460> 6<00:02:08.729> inch<00:02:08.850> holes<00:02:09.149> the

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
through the six inch by 6 inch holes the

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.050 
through the six inch by 6 inch holes the
persistent<00:02:10.530> they<00:02:11.220> pushed<00:02:11.550> their<00:02:11.730> way<00:02:11.790> around

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
persistent they pushed their way around

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.670 
persistent they pushed their way around
there<00:02:12.420> always<00:02:12.570> that's<00:02:13.020> enough<00:02:13.320> that<00:02:13.440> they<00:02:13.530> go

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
there always that's enough that they go

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.140 
there always that's enough that they go
around<00:02:13.709> there<00:02:14.010> well<00:02:14.160> it's<00:02:14.190> kind<00:02:14.610> of<00:02:14.640> exploring

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
around there well it's kind of exploring

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.350 
around there well it's kind of exploring
pushing<00:02:16.110> into<00:02:16.260> holes<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.800> digging<00:02:17.070> holes

beavers<00:02:18.360> are<00:02:18.510> of<00:02:18.750> amazing<00:02:19.530> instincts

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
beavers are of amazing instincts

amazingly in tune with their environment

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.210 
amazingly in tune with their environment
but<00:02:24.240> they<00:02:24.420> do<00:02:24.480> not<00:02:24.810> do<00:02:25.140> very<00:02:25.320> much<00:02:25.680> deductive

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
but they do not do very much deductive

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.370 
but they do not do very much deductive
reasoning<00:02:26.300> I've<00:02:27.300> just<00:02:27.570> made<00:02:28.110> it<00:02:28.260> my<00:02:28.350> life's
