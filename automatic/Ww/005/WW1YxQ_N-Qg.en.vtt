 Just me and I like couscous 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.150
 make a portion only for me of a 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.149
 faster was also where 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.340
 a will the name of eating couscous 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:37.680
 pregnant things and then I went to search 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.660
 on the internet and I found this recipe had and 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.180
 I decided to bring you here. 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.570
 so it's very very simple, you go 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.149
 need own flour for the 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.370
 courses in corn flour focused you 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.960
 I'll use it in the case from here that comes 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.489
 written with the courses nÃ© 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.280
 but you can buy the one that comes 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:02.399
 shifting also fell it did not feel so good 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:04.619
 price from here and to make a little bowl already 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.780
 that's enough 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:12.060
 Let's open , let's find the 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:16.770
 you will use this stage in 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:19.400
 April focused one and a half cup one 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.400

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.270

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.610
 Let me take the session to the embassy fund. 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.530
 a cup and a half you will need 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.750
 a cup of water 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.150
 so if you want to double the revenue 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:50.320
 You're going to use three cups of flour. 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.610
 focused on corn to two cups of 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.970
 water so you can be doubling 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.160
 both revenue and time for you 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.400
 make this recipe in micro waves then 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:03.640
 here is a cup and a half of 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.800
 corn focused the hawk and a cup of 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:11.200
 Water 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:22.090
 you will mess it up here moves well 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:29.170
 the end of this whole flour mexico 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:31.810
 it goes down well that mix you go 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.700
 letting rest will be right in the middle 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.160
 as well as the feeling that you 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:42.910
 put too much but not you did not put 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:45.610
 in March it is so until one of the 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.860
 access to water in the field that is not 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:52.540
 Worried, you'll rest for 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:54.280
 more or less this mixthed here the 10 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.190
 to 15 minutes 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:01.120
 if you want your course without salt without 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.050
 nothing you use so but if you do not 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.730
 want to 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.500
 you're suddenly going to use margarine 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.600
 Do you want to use with the sauce? 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.989
 you can not put the salt then put 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:15.360
 add salt here even in the 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:18.850
 recipe I'm going to put the salt because I 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.580
 I prefer that well little in August k 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:25.690
 1 mixture well here 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:30.690
 mixing the mixture again with the daughter 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.690
 such that the same mix 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:40.739
 and let it rest for 10 15 minutes 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:43.439
 good to rest for 20 minutes 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.459
 here it is but as I said from 10 to 15 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:47.280
 minutes 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.889
 now you can both use the same 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.989
 is incipient in this case here I can take 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:53.310
 this vessel or microwave 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.230
 but how do I want to do a portion? 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.609
 misinform to show you how 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.579
 are the courses 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:02.129
 you can choose two ways to do it 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:05.129
 individual portions tie in two 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:09.480
 cups such as these or 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:12.419
 putting a cup just starts for example 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.810
 Okay, I'll opt for this one to arrive. 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:17.639
 Here, then, I'll show you. 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:21.000
 that water left over that was left over here 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:22.710
 in the corner was absorbed all as 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.380
 flour 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:29.880
 then it is well're wet 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:36.780
 and now you go in my case here I go 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:40.260
 download will only refer you 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:43.139
 put individual contest in the queues 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:47.849
 separated but exactly two cups 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:49.590
 this position is more or less or 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:55.470
 put a big cup like this is the 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:58.620
 Time is good 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:03.990
 in this case, if it were impostors 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:05.909
 and put it is to divide going 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.039
 the cup would stand two minutes and 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:09.930
 half in the microwave for each cup 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:12.120
 separate and cook 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.340
 separately at two and a half minutes 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.770
 then another two and a half minutes 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.509
 How did you choose to put in that cup? 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:22.530
 important individual 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:25.710
 I 'll put it on for five minutes if 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:28.229
 I need to add another minute, I'm going 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.650
 put it on five minutes later I'll go 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:34.400
 to see if you need more or less 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.400
 high impotence 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:45.850
 now I'm going to misinform myself 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:47.830
 I knew it was going just as was the couscous 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.480
 super fast right 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.040
 if you were to make us stay for two 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.920
 minutes and half a minute the mice 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.590
 Now let's cut something to see if it's 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:59.140
 approved or not 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:02.310
 Look, we can only put or receive 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:08.110
 a kit that you want at home stayed 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:11.560
 pretty firm and I'm going now 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:15.060
 kill my will and you can eat 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.060
 anyway you want 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:23.920
 so it was super firm on the stove 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:26.130
 You can eat with meat sauce with 

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.450
 ground beef sausage 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:30.940
 margarine but I'm going to eat the way I 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:32.710
 The club in my childhood was with milk. 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:36.370
 a little sugar 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:38.140
 Good people, do as you prefer to party. 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.750

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:43.150

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.020
 I made them come and enjoy and bring them to 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.430

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.800
 If you liked the video, do not forget to 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:49.990
 kurt is very important here for the 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.430
 channel so that it can be disclosed and 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.720
 I can put bringing more receptive 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:56.820
