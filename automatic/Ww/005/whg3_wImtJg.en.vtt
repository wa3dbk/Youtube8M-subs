00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.880
 ja 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.390
 no 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:54.400
 we present and madame bernard 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:57.760
 director is what you had 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.550
 a lot of students in this school and I 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.080
 must introduce me I am madam lÃ©onard 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.339
 the school principal I said 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.040
 hello to everyone because I 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:06.820
 believe it's useful five days 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.500
 then in your school 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.729
 Well, there are 300 students in primary school and 200 in 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.759
 kindergarten 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:19.119
 I only take care of primary and 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:22.600
 there would be how many adversaries 17 classes 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:24.880
 is undecided in clear then there are some 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.590
 eleven that normally works like 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.320
 in all belgium 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.000
 ice like yours and then we have six 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.929
 classes that works in immersion 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.520
 linguistic 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:35.170
 so children learn in 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:41.109
 Dutch and French 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:42.670
 and these 17 via sad or will be can be 

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:45.100
 by montbron a little bit difficult 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.640
 it's true especially in a big school 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:51.250
 with a population of people who 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.319
 come from any horizon 1 who are 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.840
 different but I think it's also 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:58.569
 a great wealth because it 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.060
 teaches children to live together in 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:03.729
 show tolerance to better 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.380
 know others and that I think that 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.939
 that would be good in addition to all 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.590
 other learning so for me 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:13.810
 it's really something strong 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:15.579
