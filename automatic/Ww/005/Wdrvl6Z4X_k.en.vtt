00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
the specs of my pc now the main specs

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.820 
the specs of my pc now the main specs
are<00:00:08.970> on<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.420> screen<00:00:09.780> right<00:00:09.809> now<00:00:09.960> i'm<00:00:10.590> not

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
are on the screen right now i'm not

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.320 
are on the screen right now i'm not
going<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.010> go<00:00:11.130> into<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.550> all<00:00:11.670> nitty-gritty<00:00:12.210> of

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
going to go into the all nitty-gritty of

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.450 
going to go into the all nitty-gritty of
like<00:00:12.420> every<00:00:12.840> fan<00:00:13.139> I<00:00:13.170> have<00:00:13.620> because<00:00:14.009> I<00:00:14.040> did<00:00:14.309> up

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
like every fan I have because I did up

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.609 
like every fan I have because I did up
for<00:00:14.700> bonus<00:00:15.059> fans<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.599> I<00:00:15.929> did<00:00:16.109> go<00:00:16.260> for<00:00:16.289> water

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
for bonus fans and I did go for water

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.400 
for bonus fans and I did go for water
cooling<00:00:17.250> but<00:00:18.119> that<00:00:18.270> is<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.539> think<00:00:18.600> it's<00:00:18.810> corsair

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
cooling but that is I think it's corsair

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.320 
cooling but that is I think it's corsair
water<00:00:19.619> cooling<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.279> just<00:00:20.490> random<00:00:20.939> fans<00:00:21.180> I

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
water cooling and just random fans I

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.179 
water cooling and just random fans I
don't<00:00:21.570> know<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.810> make<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:22.109> them<00:00:22.230> but<00:00:23.100> yeah

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
don't know the make of them but yeah

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.560 
don't know the make of them but yeah
these<00:00:23.369> are<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.640> main<00:00:23.789> specs<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.359> case

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
these are the main specs of the case

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.109 
these are the main specs of the case
itself<00:00:25.019> that<00:00:25.350> have<00:00:25.650> pictures<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:27.000> actual

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
itself that have pictures of the actual

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.599 
itself that have pictures of the actual
computer<00:00:27.449> itself<00:00:27.750> after<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.920> specs<00:00:29.279> screen

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
computer itself after the specs screen

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.999 
computer itself after the specs screen
but<00:00:29.939> it's<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.359> next<00:00:31.170> phantom<00:00:31.650> full<00:00:31.830> tower

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
but it's a next phantom full tower

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.830 
but it's a next phantom full tower
gaming<00:00:32.250> case<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.610> think<00:00:32.790> it's<00:00:32.910> their<00:00:33.030> best<00:00:33.329> case

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
gaming case I think it's their best case

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.530 
gaming case I think it's their best case
they<00:00:34.079> do<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.620> Phantom<00:00:35.370> series<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:36.030> has

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
they do of the Phantom series it has

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.619 
they do of the Phantom series it has
integrated<00:00:37.640> different<00:00:38.640> controls<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.239> fans<00:00:39.450> at

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
integrated different controls of fans at

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.139 
integrated different controls of fans at
the<00:00:39.719> top<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:40.140> can<00:00:40.290> turn<00:00:40.500> its<00:00:41.160> specific<00:00:41.670> fans<00:00:41.910> off

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
the top I can turn its specific fans off

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.520 
the top I can turn its specific fans off
if<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.420> didn't<00:00:42.690> need<00:00:42.780> all<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:43.110> them<00:00:43.200> if<00:00:43.410> it's

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
if I didn't need all of them if it's

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.529 
if I didn't need all of them if it's
like<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.710> cold<00:00:44.070> winter's<00:00:44.460> day<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.910> don't<00:00:45.450> need

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
like a cold winter's day I don't need

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.209 
like a cold winter's day I don't need
that<00:00:45.690> extra<00:00:45.960> calling<00:00:46.440> with<00:00:46.620> summer's<00:00:47.070> day<00:00:47.190> I

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
that extra calling with summer's day I

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.680 
that extra calling with summer's day I
can<00:00:47.430> put<00:00:47.550> them<00:00:47.670> all<00:00:47.820> on<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.239> type<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.450> thing

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
can put them all on that type of thing

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.069 
can put them all on that type of thing
and<00:00:48.840> it's<00:00:49.710> huge<00:00:50.840> compared<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.899> my<00:00:52.050> old

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
and it's huge compared to my old

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.799 
and it's huge compared to my old
computer<00:00:52.649> I'd<00:00:53.340> say<00:00:53.610> this<00:00:53.730> computer<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.149> easily

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
computer I'd say this computer is easily

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.630 
computer I'd say this computer is easily
a<00:00:54.840> third<00:00:55.260> bigger<00:00:55.800> but<00:00:56.039> obviously<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.610> a

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
a third bigger but obviously this is a

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.660 
a third bigger but obviously this is a
full<00:00:57.030> tower<00:00:57.390> gaming<00:00:57.719> case<00:00:58.050> if<00:00:58.949> you're<00:00:59.280> someone

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
full tower gaming case if you're someone

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.939 
full tower gaming case if you're someone
that<00:00:59.730> has<00:00:59.940> just<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.239> standard<00:01:00.719> computer<00:01:01.230> you

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
that has just a standard computer you

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.729 
that has just a standard computer you
also<00:01:02.129> probably<00:01:02.460> be<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:03.030> just<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.600> mid<00:01:04.049> chassis

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
also probably be a just a mid chassis

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.500 
also probably be a just a mid chassis
gaming<00:01:05.220> case<00:01:05.400> which<00:01:05.700> obviously<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.270> full

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
gaming case which obviously this is full

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.750 
gaming case which obviously this is full
so<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.049> quite<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.380> bit<00:01:07.590> bigger<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.010> now<00:01:08.700> the

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
so it is quite a bit bigger and now the

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.200 
so it is quite a bit bigger and now the
CPU<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.930> processor<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.530> an<00:01:10.770> intel<00:01:11.040> core<00:01:11.070> i7<00:01:11.430> 48

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
CPU the processor is an intel core i7 48

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.460 
CPU the processor is an intel core i7 48
20k<00:01:12.780> quad-core<00:01:13.619> 370<00:01:14.280> hurts<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.930> you<00:01:15.930> process

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
20k quad-core 370 hurts and you process

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.280 
20k quad-core 370 hurts and you process
a<00:01:16.799> it's<00:01:16.979> fairly<00:01:17.430> fast<00:01:17.850> compared<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.540> my<00:01:18.750> old<00:01:18.780> at

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
a it's fairly fast compared to my old at

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.690 
a it's fairly fast compared to my old at
my<00:01:19.500> old<00:01:19.650> computer<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.220> i'll<00:01:20.310> do<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.460> bit<00:01:20.670> of

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
my old computer so i'll do a bit of

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.490 
my old computer so i'll do a bit of
comparison<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.360> my<00:01:21.479> old<00:01:21.630> one<00:01:21.780> my<00:01:22.229> old<00:01:22.350> computer

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
comparison to my old one my old computer

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.740 
comparison to my old one my old computer
was<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.780> 525<00:01:24.780> 50k<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.619> think<00:01:26.220> around<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.240> so

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
was a I 525 50k I think around that so

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.830 
was a I 525 50k I think around that so
this<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.229> two<00:01:28.530> seasons<00:01:28.979> obviously<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:30.270> newer

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
this is two seasons obviously and newer

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.560 
this is two seasons obviously and newer
than<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.229> old<00:01:31.560> one<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.070> it's<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.729> 4800<00:01:33.450> now<00:01:33.540> I

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
than the old one and it's a 4800 now I

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.999 
than the old one and it's a 4800 now I
could<00:01:33.810> have<00:01:33.900> gone<00:01:34.079> for<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> bit<00:01:34.590> better<00:01:34.710> that

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
could have gone for a bit better that

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.499 
could have gone for a bit better that
but<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.220> difference<00:01:35.579> between<00:01:35.939> this

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
but the difference between this

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.810 
but the difference between this
processor<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.409> one<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:38.130> my<00:01:38.280> option<00:01:38.640> was

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
processor and the one that my option was

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.030 
processor and the one that my option was
above<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.240> was<00:01:39.450> like<00:01:39.600> 200<00:01:39.810> pounds<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.590> then

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
above this was like 200 pounds and then

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.649 
above this was like 200 pounds and then
the<00:01:41.159> performance<00:01:41.729> differences<00:01:42.180> wasn't<00:01:42.540> that

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
the performance differences wasn't that

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.929 
the performance differences wasn't that
huge<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:43.380> comparison<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.220> price<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:44.880> I

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
huge in comparison to the price so I

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.030 
huge in comparison to the price so I
opted<00:01:45.180> for<00:01:45.360> this<00:01:45.479> one<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.930> my<00:01:46.409> computer<00:01:47.009> is

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
opted for this one and my computer is

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.649 
opted for this one and my computer is
really<00:01:47.520> really<00:01:47.820> quickly<00:01:48.030> that's<00:01:48.329> one<00:01:48.479> thing

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
really really quickly that's one thing

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.510 
really really quickly that's one thing
or<00:01:48.869> it's<00:01:49.320> really<00:01:49.590> really<00:01:49.770> fast<00:01:49.979> that's<00:01:50.220> one

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
or it's really really fast that's one

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.060 
or it's really really fast that's one
thing<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.790> will<00:01:50.970> say<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:52.320> boots<00:01:52.649> up<00:01:52.860> near

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
thing I will say is it boots up near

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.670 
thing I will say is it boots up near
instantly<00:01:53.490> loads<00:01:53.939> games<00:01:54.270> instantly<00:01:54.869> even

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
instantly loads games instantly even

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.410 
instantly loads games instantly even
though<00:01:55.920> if<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.399> look<00:01:56.549> later<00:01:56.759> on<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.060> list<00:01:57.240> it

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
though if you look later on the list it

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.179 
though if you look later on the list it
doesn't<00:01:57.689> have<00:01:57.780> an<00:01:57.869> SSD<00:01:58.259> yep<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.619> will<00:01:58.680> go<00:01:58.920> on<00:01:59.040> to

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
doesn't have an SSD yep I will go on to

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.760 
doesn't have an SSD yep I will go on to
that<00:01:59.340> now<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.299> motherboard<00:02:00.780> itself<00:02:00.899> I'm

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
that now the motherboard itself I'm

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.139 
that now the motherboard itself I'm
someone<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.100> does<00:02:02.430> not<00:02:02.579> know<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.820> lot<00:02:03.060> about

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
someone that does not know a lot about

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.030 
someone that does not know a lot about
motherboards<00:02:03.600> so<00:02:04.079> this<00:02:04.259> was<00:02:04.409> kind<00:02:04.469> of<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.740> blind

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
motherboards so this was kind of a blind

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.609 
motherboards so this was kind of a blind
thing<00:02:05.250> for<00:02:05.460> me<00:02:05.600> but<00:02:06.600> I<00:02:06.630> basically<00:02:06.899> just<00:02:07.200> looked

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
thing for me but I basically just looked

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.309 
thing for me but I basically just looked
for<00:02:08.160> opportunities<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:09.179> improve<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:10.080> if<00:02:10.170> I

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
for opportunities to improve it if I

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.350 
for opportunities to improve it if I
wanted<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:11.009> this<00:02:11.879> motherboard<00:02:12.239> has

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
wanted to and this motherboard has

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.450 
wanted to and this motherboard has
a<00:02:13.390> tram<00:02:14.050> slot<00:02:14.380> available<00:02:14.650> it's<00:02:14.980> only<00:02:15.220> using

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
a tram slot available it's only using

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.310 
a tram slot available it's only using
for<00:02:15.760> right<00:02:15.970> now<00:02:16.000> so<00:02:16.390> potentially<00:02:16.900> I<00:02:16.930> could<00:02:16.990> put

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
for right now so potentially I could put

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.680 
for right now so potentially I could put
for<00:02:17.650> more<00:02:17.830> RAM<00:02:18.040> in<00:02:18.370> this<00:02:18.610> like<00:02:18.910> individual

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
for more RAM in this like individual

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.980 
for more RAM in this like individual
slots<00:02:20.430> so<00:02:21.430> yeah<00:02:21.970> that's<00:02:22.270> basically<00:02:22.600> my

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
slots so yeah that's basically my

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.380 
slots so yeah that's basically my
knowledge<00:02:23.440> you<00:02:23.740> know<00:02:23.860> it<00:02:23.950> has<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:24.730> SLI

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
knowledge you know it has the SLI

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.420 
knowledge you know it has the SLI
available<00:02:25.960> as<00:02:26.020> cross<00:02:26.290> by<00:02:26.500> even<00:02:26.800> though<00:02:26.890> I<00:02:26.920> you

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
available as cross by even though I you

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.380 
available as cross by even though I you
know<00:02:27.550> with<00:02:27.700> GTX<00:02:28.350> nvidia<00:02:29.350> not<00:02:29.670> md<00:02:30.670> yeah<00:02:31.180> it<00:02:31.270> has

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
know with GTX nvidia not md yeah it has

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.240 
know with GTX nvidia not md yeah it has
sli<00:02:31.960> I've<00:02:32.170> got<00:02:32.350> all<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.560> cables<00:02:32.920> for<00:02:33.010> that<00:02:33.130> if

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
sli I've got all the cables for that if

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.830 
sli I've got all the cables for that if
I<00:02:33.310> wanted<00:02:33.520> to<00:02:33.730> do<00:02:33.880> that<00:02:34.030> in<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.180> future<00:02:34.360> sorry

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
I wanted to do that in the future sorry

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.570 
I wanted to do that in the future sorry
I<00:02:34.990> don't<00:02:35.470> know<00:02:35.590> it<00:02:35.740> seemed<00:02:36.160> quite<00:02:36.340> a<00:02:36.370> good

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
I don't know it seemed quite a good

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.860 
I don't know it seemed quite a good
motherboard<00:02:36.880> to<00:02:37.120> me<00:02:37.210> although<00:02:37.390> it's<00:02:37.630> not<00:02:37.660> my

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
motherboard to me although it's not my

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.580 
motherboard to me although it's not my
expertise<00:02:38.290> and<00:02:38.560> other<00:02:39.370> ram<00:02:39.610> I've<00:02:40.570> got<00:02:40.870> 16<00:02:41.350> gig

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
expertise and other ram I've got 16 gig

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.760 
expertise and other ram I've got 16 gig
in<00:02:41.740> there<00:02:41.890> four<00:02:42.100> times<00:02:42.130> for<00:02:42.640> ddr3<00:02:43.120> 1600<00:02:43.840> now<00:02:44.740> I

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
in there four times for ddr3 1600 now I

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.070 
in there four times for ddr3 1600 now I
could<00:02:45.010> have<00:02:45.100> got<00:02:45.250> quicker<00:02:45.550> with<00:02:46.450> ram<00:02:46.720> in<00:02:46.930> this

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
could have got quicker with ram in this

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.780 
could have got quicker with ram in this
but<00:02:47.290> i<00:02:47.320> thought<00:02:47.530> you<00:02:48.070> know<00:02:48.100> my<00:02:48.430> old<00:02:48.580> computer

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
but i thought you know my old computer

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.940 
but i thought you know my old computer
was<00:02:49.120> fairly<00:02:49.420> fast<00:02:49.810> my<00:02:50.170> old<00:02:50.320> computer<00:02:50.500> is<00:02:50.740> eight

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
was fairly fast my old computer is eight

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.540 
was fairly fast my old computer is eight
gig<00:02:51.340> 1600<00:02:52.300> so<00:02:52.840> if<00:02:53.230> it's<00:02:53.410> 16<00:02:53.860> gig<00:02:54.010> surely<00:02:54.250> it<00:02:54.430> be

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
gig 1600 so if it's 16 gig surely it be

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.670 
gig 1600 so if it's 16 gig surely it be
okay<00:02:54.910> so<00:02:55.360> i<00:02:55.390> got<00:02:55.660> that<00:02:55.780> I<00:02:55.840> opted<00:02:56.140> for<00:02:56.320> this<00:02:56.440> and

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
okay so i got that I opted for this and

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.460 
okay so i got that I opted for this and
yeah<00:02:57.310> as<00:02:57.489> mentioned<00:02:57.970> before<00:02:58.120> it's<00:02:58.540> as<00:02:58.989> fast<00:02:59.200> as

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
yeah as mentioned before it's as fast as

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.410 
yeah as mentioned before it's as fast as
anything<00:02:59.709> it's<00:03:00.070> faster<00:03:00.400> than<00:03:00.520> my<00:03:00.610> old<00:03:00.790> pc<00:03:00.970> and

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
anything it's faster than my old pc and

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.449 
anything it's faster than my old pc and
i<00:03:01.840> don't<00:03:02.260> really<00:03:02.410> need<00:03:02.620> much<00:03:02.830> faster<00:03:03.370> than

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
i don't really need much faster than

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.430 
i don't really need much faster than
that<00:03:03.700> you<00:03:04.180> know<00:03:04.300> I've<00:03:04.600> already<00:03:04.780> processed<00:03:05.320> a

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
that you know I've already processed a

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.770 
that you know I've already processed a
few<00:03:05.650> videos<00:03:05.830> rendered<00:03:06.400> them<00:03:06.550> and<00:03:06.820> its<00:03:07.090> really

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
few videos rendered them and its really

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.380 
few videos rendered them and its really
really<00:03:07.959> quick<00:03:08.260> so<00:03:08.800> I<00:03:08.880> don't<00:03:09.880> really<00:03:09.970> think<00:03:10.120> I

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
really quick so I don't really think I

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.720 
really quick so I don't really think I
needed<00:03:10.630> anything<00:03:10.930> more<00:03:11.290> if<00:03:11.470> maybe<00:03:12.459> in<00:03:12.640> the

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
needed anything more if maybe in the

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.280 
needed anything more if maybe in the
down<00:03:12.880> in<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.120> future<00:03:13.510> you<00:03:13.750> know<00:03:13.870> I<00:03:13.900> don't<00:03:14.170> know

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
down in the future you know I don't know

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.479 
down in the future you know I don't know
years<00:03:14.590> time<00:03:14.830> when<00:03:14.950> I'm<00:03:15.040> looking<00:03:15.280> to<00:03:15.310> upgrade

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
years time when I'm looking to upgrade

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.640 
years time when I'm looking to upgrade
it<00:03:15.790> a<00:03:15.820> little<00:03:15.940> bit<00:03:16.090> more<00:03:16.239> maybe<00:03:16.989> then<00:03:17.320> I'll<00:03:17.470> go

it a little bit more maybe then I'll go

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.150 
it a little bit more maybe then I'll go
for<00:03:17.830> something<00:03:18.010> like<00:03:18.130> 2400<00:03:18.780> mhz<00:03:20.070> whatever<00:03:21.070> it

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
for something like 2400 mhz whatever it

for something like 2400 mhz whatever it
is<00:03:21.280> in<00:03:21.489> speed<00:03:21.820> of<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.090> ram<00:03:22.269> but<00:03:22.600> as<00:03:22.810> mentioned

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
is in speed of the ram but as mentioned

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:24.300 
is in speed of the ram but as mentioned
i'm<00:03:23.350> not<00:03:23.470> an<00:03:23.590> expert<00:03:23.680> in<00:03:23.920> these<00:03:24.070> type<00:03:24.280> of

nothing really special just the big
storage<00:04:17.229> I<00:04:17.709> do<00:04:18.280> have<00:04:18.669> an<00:04:18.790> SSD<00:04:19.209> available<00:04:19.840> from

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
storage I do have an SSD available from

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.500 
storage I do have an SSD available from
my<00:04:20.260> old<00:04:20.440> pc<00:04:20.709> that<00:04:21.130> eventually<00:04:21.729> if<00:04:21.910> I<00:04:22.030> do<00:04:22.090> want

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
my old pc that eventually if I do want

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.810 
my old pc that eventually if I do want
to<00:04:22.599> put<00:04:22.840> it<00:04:22.960> in<00:04:23.080> my<00:04:23.229> new<00:04:23.410> one<00:04:23.620> I<00:04:23.770> will<00:04:24.190> but

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
to put it in my new one I will but

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.430 
to put it in my new one I will but
honestly<00:04:24.970> it's<00:04:25.479> so<00:04:25.660> quick<00:04:25.870> right<00:04:26.110> now<00:04:26.229> I<00:04:26.260> don't

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
honestly it's so quick right now I don't

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.120 
honestly it's so quick right now I don't
see<00:04:26.800> how

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
see how

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.220 
see how
it<00:04:27.370> will<00:04:27.490> be<00:04:27.580> faster<00:04:28.090> so<00:04:28.360> if<00:04:28.690> it<00:04:28.870> does<00:04:29.080> slow

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
it will be faster so if it does slow

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.750 
it will be faster so if it does slow
down<00:04:29.500> a<00:04:29.530> bit<00:04:29.620> in<00:04:29.770> like<00:04:30.100> I<00:04:30.280> don't<00:04:30.370> know<00:04:30.460> six

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
down a bit in like I don't know six

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.060 
down a bit in like I don't know six
months<00:04:31.030> time<00:04:31.240> then<00:04:31.810> I<00:04:31.840> will<00:04:31.990> put<00:04:32.320> an<00:04:32.410> SSD<00:04:32.830> in<00:04:32.920> it

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
months time then I will put an SSD in it

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.400 
months time then I will put an SSD in it
but<00:04:33.190> for<00:04:33.370> right<00:04:33.520> now<00:04:33.550> I<00:04:33.700> think<00:04:33.850> it's<00:04:34.090> okay<00:04:34.450> and

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
but for right now I think it's okay and

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.380 
but for right now I think it's okay and
then<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:35.620> operate<00:04:35.920> system<00:04:36.340> is<00:04:36.580> in<00:04:36.850> Microsoft

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 
then the operate system is in Microsoft

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.320 
then the operate system is in Microsoft
Windows<00:04:37.570> 8.1<00:04:37.990> which<00:04:38.950> I'm<00:04:39.190> getting<00:04:39.880> used<00:04:40.120> to

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
Windows 8.1 which I'm getting used to

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.940 
Windows 8.1 which I'm getting used to
but<00:04:40.540> honestly<00:04:40.870> I<00:04:40.930> would<00:04:41.140> much<00:04:41.260> prefer<00:04:41.320> windows

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
but honestly I would much prefer windows

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.800 
but honestly I would much prefer windows
seven<00:04:42.310> so<00:04:42.850> that<00:04:43.000> lasted<00:04:43.360> quite<00:04:43.390> a<00:04:43.540> while

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810
