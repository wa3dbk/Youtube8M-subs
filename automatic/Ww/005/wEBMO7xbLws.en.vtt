and<00:01:36.530> soft<00:01:36.920> this<00:01:37.429> is<00:01:37.610> proof<00:01:37.849> that<00:01:37.880> it's<00:01:38.179> okay<00:01:38.539> to

00:01:38.589 --> 00:01:38.599 
and soft this is proof that it's okay to

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:40.660 
and soft this is proof that it's okay to
look<00:01:39.110> outside<00:01:39.470> of<00:01:39.530> your<00:01:39.739> size<00:01:39.979> whether<00:01:40.340> it's<00:01:40.579> a
