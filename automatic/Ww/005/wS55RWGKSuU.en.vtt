00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
the end some of my students can do the

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.030 
the end some of my students can do the
motions<00:03:13.019> and<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.230> sounds<00:03:13.500> at<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.620> same<00:03:13.680> time

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
motions and the sounds at the same time

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.410 
motions and the sounds at the same time
it's<00:03:14.250> hard<00:03:14.400> for<00:03:14.519> me<00:03:14.610> to<00:03:14.700> do<00:03:14.819> but<00:03:15.060> they<00:03:15.150> like<00:03:15.299> to

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
it's hard for me to do but they like to

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.300 
it's hard for me to do but they like to
take<00:03:15.540> that<00:03:15.690> time<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:15.959> do<00:03:16.319> that<00:03:16.470> when<00:03:17.190> you're

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
take that time to do that when you're

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.580 
take that time to do that when you're
finished<00:03:17.610> with<00:03:17.700> a<00:03:17.819> file<00:03:18.150> it<00:03:18.840> can<00:03:19.049> become<00:03:19.349> a

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
finished with a file it can become a

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.309 
finished with a file it can become a
literacy<00:03:20.069> center<00:03:20.549> you<00:03:21.480> can<00:03:21.599> move<00:03:21.750> a<00:03:21.780> file<00:03:22.049> back

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
literacy center you can move a file back

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.990 
literacy center you can move a file back
and<00:03:22.530> forth<00:03:23.660> the<00:03:24.660> children<00:03:24.959> can<00:03:25.109> find<00:03:25.410> other

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
and forth the children can find other

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.550 
and forth the children can find other
phonics<00:03:27.510> patterns<00:03:27.870> that<00:03:27.959> they're<00:03:28.140> working<00:03:28.290> on

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
phonics patterns that they're working on

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.960 
phonics patterns that they're working on
it's<00:03:28.709> differentiated<00:03:29.519> they<00:03:29.609> don't<00:03:29.790> have<00:03:29.879> to

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
it's differentiated they don't have to

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.490 
it's differentiated they don't have to
just<00:03:30.150> come<00:03:30.299> up<00:03:30.420> and<00:03:30.569> do<00:03:30.690> a<00:03:30.720> digraph<00:03:31.230> so<00:03:31.440> they

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
just come up and do a digraph so they

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.530 
just come up and do a digraph so they
could<00:03:31.650> do<00:03:31.739> things<00:03:31.890> that<00:03:32.040> sight<00:03:32.730> words<00:03:32.970> they

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
could do things that sight words they

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.119 
could do things that sight words they
can<00:03:33.690> do<00:03:33.780> letter<00:03:33.989> sounds<00:03:34.620> things<00:03:34.859> that<00:03:35.010> their

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
can do letter sounds things that their

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.130 
can do letter sounds things that their
name<00:03:35.310> starts<00:03:35.700> with<00:03:36.109> it's<00:03:37.109> very

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
name starts with it's very

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.690 
name starts with it's very
differentiated<00:03:37.590> to<00:03:38.040> make<00:03:38.190> it<00:03:38.310> their<00:03:38.489> own

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
differentiated to make it their own

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.640 
differentiated to make it their own
so<00:03:38.940> they<00:03:39.060> come<00:03:39.209> over<00:03:39.239> here<00:03:39.690> and<00:03:39.989> I<00:03:40.319> let<00:03:40.530> two

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
so they come over here and I let two

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.470 
so they come over here and I let two
students<00:03:41.010> do<00:03:41.099> this<00:03:41.250> as<00:03:41.370> a<00:03:41.400> center<00:03:41.819> look<00:03:42.329> come

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
students do this as a center look come

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.960 
students do this as a center look come
over<00:03:42.629> and<00:03:42.690> they'll<00:03:42.810> say<00:03:42.989> well<00:03:43.140> oh<00:03:43.470> you<00:03:43.769> says<00:03:44.220> al

I<00:03:45.079> see<00:03:46.079> cases<00:03:46.379> pick<00:03:46.859> up<00:03:47.670> there's<00:03:48.030> a<00:03:48.090> digraph

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.809 

th-th-th<00:03:52.260> and<00:03:53.160> they'll<00:03:53.280> say<00:03:53.430> well<00:03:53.549> I<00:03:53.579> see<00:03:53.790> a
