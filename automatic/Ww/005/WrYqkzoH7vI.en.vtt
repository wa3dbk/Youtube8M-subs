00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:10.400
 Medina 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:15.680
 It is a story of the days when Tokyo was called Edo before that 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:21.250
 There was a hill called country slope of have along the moat of Edo Castle 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:27.450
 It was a time when there was no movement, so it was black at night 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:34.700
 It was a lonely road with few people at the end of that eating day 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:34.700
 One night the approval of one person was climbing quickly with the foot of Kunisaka of the tree 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:48.360
 9 because apparently bewitch the people in this this area that fall out of the hill out badger at night 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:50.910
 I do not think the griping bend over to suddenly see if a woman is a moat edge 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:56.170
 I'm going to go out to the moat 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.320
 The worried merchant approached the woman and spoke 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.579

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.579
 Is there something troubling you 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:16.220
 A woman hides her face with a kimono sleeve and keeps crying 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:22.870
 Let me become a force if I receive it 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:26.920
 Merchants apply a gentle voice and Onda was rising while hiding the face 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:30.860
 And Why do not you flower to me 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.330
 I put my hand on the woman's shoulder in the show 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.400
 Then the horse looked back 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:40.000
 And I was accustomed to face with the smooth stop by hand 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.560
 The meanwhile 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.560

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.560

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:57.360
 People who danced so fled away rather there is no courage to look back 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.750
 I will just stand on a dark slope, and I can see the light at a distance far away 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.750
 The 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:07.740
 The light that runs toward the subject with scream was the lantern of a buckwheat noodle stall at a stall 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:11.370
 When we get to the stand where Toskater people are there 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:14.190
 Sony sat down as relieved 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:20.000
 Soba shop is surprised 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.000
 Voice was also often handy not be in exactly the entire brain 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.330

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.380
 Contact Miss problem does not have than a highwayman 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.470

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.050
 Kagaa of the woman 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.780

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.740
 The woman's face 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:02.480
 To what was such a face 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:06.650
 I mentioned my face as a buckwheat noodle festival 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:13.959
 Then his soba is now Tsu plastic stick, such as eggs 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:13.959
 At that moment, the light of the lantern went out and the area was completely dark.
