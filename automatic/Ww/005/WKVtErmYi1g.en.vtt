00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
where everyone come harvest them quite

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.229 
where everyone come harvest them quite
easily<00:00:55.980> they're<00:00:56.340> considered<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.730> delicacy

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
easily they're considered a delicacy

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.270 
easily they're considered a delicacy
so<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.170> harvesting<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.800> eggs<00:00:58.980> from<00:00:59.250> the

so the harvesting of the eggs from the
wild<00:00:59.699> has<00:00:59.940> created<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.270> situation<00:01:00.449> where<00:01:00.840> they

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
wild has created a situation where they

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.290

had<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.199> hard<00:01:01.469> time<00:01:01.530> reproducing<00:01:02.520> thankfully

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
had a hard time reproducing thankfully

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.670 
had a hard time reproducing thankfully
those<00:01:03.510> zoos<00:01:03.809> like<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.049> Maryland<00:01:04.409> Zoo<00:01:04.439> or

these two are visiting us from have

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.000 
these two are visiting us from have
great<00:01:06.659> breeding<00:01:06.900> programs<00:01:07.409> which<00:01:07.680> increase

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
great breeding programs which increase

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.770 
great breeding programs which increase
the<00:01:08.040> numbers<00:01:08.460> which<00:01:08.610> allowed<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.150> also<00:01:09.450> us<00:01:09.600> to

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
the numbers which allowed and also us to

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.179 
the numbers which allowed and also us to
learn<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.960> lot<00:01:10.140> more<00:01:10.200> about<00:01:10.380> them<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.010> apply

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
learn a lot more about them and apply

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.390 
learn a lot more about them and apply
that<00:01:11.400> knowledge<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.060> wild<00:01:12.330> habitats<00:01:12.750> to

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
that knowledge to the wild habitats to

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.770 
that knowledge to the wild habitats to
sweet<00:01:14.400> they<00:01:14.610> really<00:01:14.939> are<00:01:15.150> soft

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
sweet they really are soft

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.870 
sweet they really are soft
yes<00:01:16.020> very<00:01:16.320> soft<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.950> know<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.460> allows<00:01:17.640> them

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
yes very soft you know that allows them

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.520 
yes very soft you know that allows them
to<00:01:18.000> go<00:01:18.150> through<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.509> water<00:01:18.720> very<00:01:18.900> quickly<00:01:19.020> and

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
to go through the water very quickly and

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.170 
to go through the water very quickly and
sometimes<00:01:19.890> when<00:01:20.310> we<00:01:20.400> see<00:01:20.430> them<00:01:20.700> swimming<00:01:20.970> we

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
sometimes when we see them swimming we

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.210 
sometimes when we see them swimming we
think<00:01:21.390> it's<00:01:21.590> incredibly<00:01:22.590> fast<00:01:22.799> but<00:01:23.009> it's<00:01:23.100> used

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
think it's incredibly fast but it's used

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.890 
think it's incredibly fast but it's used
about<00:01:23.460> five<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.909> eight<00:01:23.939> miles<00:01:24.180> an<00:01:24.390> hour<00:01:24.509> at<00:01:24.659> all

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
about five to eight miles an hour at all

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.960 
about five to eight miles an hour at all
yeah<00:01:25.259> really<00:01:25.530> it's<00:01:25.710> about<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:26.070> but<00:01:26.670> because

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
yeah really it's about it but because

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.300 
yeah really it's about it but because
again<00:01:27.420> they're<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:27.659> small<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.110> very<00:01:28.290> good<00:01:29.189> at

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
again they're so small and very good at

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.640 
again they're so small and very good at
getting<00:01:29.700> away<00:01:29.759> from<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.030> season<00:01:30.420> faster<00:01:31.320> so

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
getting away from the season faster so

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.530 
getting away from the season faster so
it<00:01:32.040> would<00:01:32.250> occur<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.729> me<00:01:32.939> we'd<00:01:33.090> have<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.390> move

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
it would occur to me we'd have to move

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.749 
it would occur to me we'd have to move

zoos again across America are doing
what's<00:02:13.370> called<00:02:13.400> a<00:02:13.580> head<00:02:13.730> start<00:02:13.940> program<00:02:14.480> where

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
what's called a head start program where

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.840 
what's called a head start program where
accredited<00:02:15.560> zoos<00:02:15.590> are<00:02:15.950> basically<00:02:16.280> breeding

hatching and raising for the first
couple<00:02:18.560> years<00:02:18.590> so<00:02:18.830> they<00:02:18.920> have<00:02:19.040> that<00:02:19.130> head

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
couple years so they have that head

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.800 
couple years so they have that head
start<00:02:19.459> and<00:02:19.790> then<00:02:20.240> sending<00:02:20.480> them<00:02:20.600> over<00:02:20.750> to

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
start and then sending them over to

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.300 
start and then sending them over to
China<00:02:21.050> for<00:02:21.230> release<00:02:21.500> into<00:02:21.740> the<00:02:21.770> reserve<00:02:22.130> is

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
China for release into the reserve is

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.580

different<00:02:23.150> from<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.750> American<00:02:23.990> there's<00:02:24.530> a

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
different from the American there's a

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.930 
different from the American there's a
subtle<00:02:24.950> difference<00:02:25.250> in<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.490> sense<00:02:25.700> that<00:02:25.760> they

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
subtle difference in the sense that they

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.060 
subtle difference in the sense that they
are<00:02:25.970> smaller<00:02:26.390> even<00:02:26.990> as<00:02:27.080> a<00:02:27.110> large<00:02:27.620> adult<00:02:27.950> they

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
are smaller even as a large adult they

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.620 
are smaller even as a large adult they
won't<00:02:28.220> get<00:02:28.310> nearly<00:02:28.580> as<00:02:28.640> big<00:02:28.760> as<00:02:28.880> an<00:02:29.240> alligator

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
won't get nearly as big as an alligator

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:30.940 
won't get nearly as big as an alligator
and<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:29.959> two<00:02:30.110> tooth<00:02:30.350> structures<00:02:30.740> different

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
and the two tooth structures different

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.860 
and the two tooth structures different
this<00:02:31.160> species<00:02:31.400> will<00:02:31.820> eat<00:02:32.000> on<00:02:32.120> mollusks<00:02:32.750> so

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
this species will eat on mollusks so

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.020 
this species will eat on mollusks so
they<00:02:32.990> have<00:02:33.110> a<00:02:33.140> duller<00:02:33.440> tooth<00:02:33.770> and<00:02:33.980> we'll<00:02:34.880> see

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
they have a duller tooth and we'll see

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.660 
they have a duller tooth and we'll see
if<00:02:35.120> we<00:02:35.959> get<00:02:36.260> a<00:02:36.440> chance<00:02:36.470> to<00:02:36.800> see<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.160> teeth<00:02:37.400> here
