that's a really reasonable price but I

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.780 
that's a really reasonable price but I

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
think about this series I think season 2

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.300 
think about this series I think season 2
did<00:04:35.539> a<00:04:35.570> little<00:04:35.840> better<00:04:36.050> than<00:04:36.200> season<00:04:36.620> 1<00:04:37.010> but

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
did a little better than season 1 but

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.150 
did a little better than season 1 but
that's<00:04:37.789> just<00:04:38.030> my<00:04:38.330> 4<00:04:38.840> take<00:04:39.080> on<00:04:39.320> it<00:04:39.440> now<00:04:40.100> the

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
that's just my 4 take on it now the
