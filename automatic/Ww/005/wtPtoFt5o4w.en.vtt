00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
belter trees here to try and break the

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.759 
belter trees here to try and break the
westerly<00:00:08.599> this<00:00:09.599> is<00:00:09.719> our<00:00:09.900> prevailing<00:00:10.290> wind

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
westerly this is our prevailing wind

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.089 
westerly this is our prevailing wind
over<00:00:11.160> here<00:00:11.370> on<00:00:11.790> Westerley<00:00:12.269> today<00:00:12.740> so<00:00:13.740> again

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
over here on Westerley today so again

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.680 
over here on Westerley today so again
that<00:00:14.309> should<00:00:14.519> be<00:00:14.610> good<00:00:14.820> because<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.839> tide

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 
that should be good because the tide

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.120 
that should be good because the tide
will<00:00:18.690> be<00:00:18.810> coming<00:00:19.020> in<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.710> wind<00:00:19.890> will<00:00:20.010> be

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
will be coming in and the wind will be

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.279 
will be coming in and the wind will be
behind<00:00:20.520> me<00:00:20.699> which<00:00:20.939> is<00:00:21.119> really<00:00:21.510> great<00:00:22.140> for

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
behind me which is really great for

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.349 
behind me which is really great for
exploring<00:00:24.920> you<00:00:25.920> can<00:00:26.130> just<00:00:26.369> bump<00:00:26.760> up<00:00:27.000> against

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
exploring you can just bump up against

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.310 
exploring you can just bump up against
the<00:00:27.510> tide<00:00:29.150> the<00:00:30.150> wind<00:00:30.330> behind<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.869> should<00:00:31.230> be

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
the tide the wind behind you should be

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.069 
the tide the wind behind you should be
great<00:00:32.000> until<00:00:33.000> what<00:00:33.149> Humbert<00:00:33.420> I'd<00:00:33.570> cut<00:00:33.840> scenes

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
great until what Humbert I'd cut scenes

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.160 
great until what Humbert I'd cut scenes
so<00:00:34.410> strong<00:00:34.890> that<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.160> can't<00:00:35.820> win<00:00:35.930> but<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.079> know

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
so strong that I can't win but you know

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:58.780 
so strong that I can't win but you know
trying<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.860> win<00:00:38.040> will<00:00:38.280> be<00:00:38.399> fun

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.310 

here<00:00:59.790> in<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.030> Anchorage<00:01:00.450> I've<00:01:00.660> got<00:01:00.870> about

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.050 

minimum<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.440> goes<00:01:04.650> down<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.100> is<00:01:05.309> about<00:01:05.339> three

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
minimum it goes down to is about three

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.520 
minimum it goes down to is about three
feet<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:06.810> when<00:01:07.050> it<00:01:07.170> gets<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.440> two<00:01:07.620> meters<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
feet so when it gets to two meters the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
feet so when it gets to two meters the
Humber<00:01:10.530> will<00:01:10.680> have<00:01:10.770> come<00:01:10.950> down<00:01:11.130> low<00:01:11.400> enough

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
Humber will have come down low enough

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.570 
Humber will have come down low enough
for<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.030> wind<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.360> die<00:01:12.660> and<00:01:13.320> then<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.830> will<00:01:14.100> go

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
for the wind to die and then I will go

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.160 
for the wind to die and then I will go
and<00:01:14.729> start<00:01:15.030> exploring<00:01:15.119> for<00:01:15.690> that's<00:01:15.869> about

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
and start exploring for that's about

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.440 
and start exploring for that's about
four<00:01:16.440> hours<00:01:16.590> away<00:01:16.860> maybe<00:01:20.150> the<00:01:21.150> weatherman

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
four hours away maybe the weatherman

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.670 
four hours away maybe the weatherman
says<00:01:21.840> wind<00:01:22.260> should<00:01:22.740> ease<00:01:27.229> it<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.290> an<00:01:28.470> amazing

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
says wind should ease it is an amazing

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:36.380 
says wind should ease it is an amazing
moving<00:01:29.310> world<00:01:29.520> oh<00:01:29.790> just<00:01:32.540> spring<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:34.170> here<00:01:35.390> the

moving world oh just spring so here the
tide<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.660> just<00:01:38.210> did<00:01:39.210> it's<00:01:40.200> manageable<00:01:40.800> but<00:01:41.670> on

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
tide is just did it's manageable but on

tide is just did it's manageable but on
the<00:01:41.910> other<00:01:41.940> side<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.420> island<00:01:42.539> it<00:01:42.840> must<00:01:42.990> be

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
the other side of the island it must be

00:01:43.140 --> 00:02:08.020 
the other side of the island it must be
absolutely<00:01:43.560> whizzing

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
nine o'clock in the morning and the high

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.640

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
tide was about an hour ago a spring hi

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.830 
tide was about an hour ago a spring hi
so<00:02:26.040> today<00:02:26.270> I've<00:02:27.270> got<00:02:27.570> a<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:30.030> Humber<00:02:30.420> goes<00:02:30.600> down

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
so today I've got a the Humber goes down

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.840 
so today I've got a the Humber goes down
to<00:02:30.989> chart<00:02:31.260> datum<00:02:31.680> which<00:02:31.950> is<00:02:32.130> basically<00:02:32.610> you

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
to chart datum which is basically you

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:33.979 
to chart datum which is basically you
know<00:02:32.970> kind<00:02:33.180> of<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.360> lowest<00:02:33.660> it<00:02:33.810> goes

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
know kind of the lowest it goes

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.600 
know kind of the lowest it goes
sometimes<00:02:34.440> it<00:02:34.770> might<00:02:34.860> go<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.070> bit<00:02:35.250> lower<00:02:35.430> than

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
sometimes it might go a bit lower than

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.130 
sometimes it might go a bit lower than
that<00:02:35.790> but<00:02:36.000> that's<00:02:36.450> where<00:02:36.660> they<00:02:36.780> measure<00:02:36.989> the

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
that but that's where they measure the

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.300 
that but that's where they measure the
chance<00:02:37.380> from<00:02:37.680> so<00:02:38.070> um<00:02:38.750> it's<00:02:39.750> chart<00:02:40.230> datum<00:02:40.650> which

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
chance from so um it's chart datum which

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.430 
chance from so um it's chart datum which
is<00:02:41.489> be<00:02:42.390> interesting<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:42.900> see<00:02:43.020> what<00:02:43.140> it<00:02:43.290> looks

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
is be interesting to see what it looks

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.630 
is be interesting to see what it looks
like<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:43.860> know<00:02:43.920> you<00:02:44.010> might<00:02:44.160> as<00:02:44.220> well<00:02:44.310> see<00:02:44.550> it

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
like you know you might as well see it

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.660 
like you know you might as well see it
at<00:02:44.850> its<00:02:45.239> extreme<00:02:45.930> I've<00:02:46.140> seen<00:02:46.380> it<00:02:46.500> for<00:02:46.709> so<00:02:47.220> I

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
at its extreme I've seen it for so I

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.000 
at its extreme I've seen it for so I
left<00:02:47.760> mooring<00:02:48.450> this<00:02:48.570> morning<00:02:49.080> it's<00:02:49.320> cold<00:02:49.620> you

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.820 
think it's the Yangtze there are some
porpoises<00:04:02.570> on<00:04:02.780> the<00:04:02.900> Yangtze<00:04:03.260> somewhere<00:04:03.650> who

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
porpoises on the Yangtze somewhere who

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.949 
porpoises on the Yangtze somewhere who
have<00:04:03.950> just<00:04:04.160> the<00:04:04.730> waters<00:04:05.240> are<00:04:05.390> so<00:04:06.520> opaque<00:04:07.959> it's

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
have just the waters are so opaque it's

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.470 
have just the waters are so opaque it's
the<00:04:09.170> Yangtze<00:04:09.740> so<00:04:09.920> cloudy<00:04:10.280> and<00:04:10.700> so<00:04:10.910> big<00:04:11.180> that<00:04:11.209> a

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
the Yangtze so cloudy and so big that a

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.199 
the Yangtze so cloudy and so big that a
whole<00:04:11.840> breed<00:04:12.380> of<00:04:12.680> porpoises<00:04:13.520> has<00:04:13.760> grown<00:04:14.000> up

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
whole breed of porpoises has grown up

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.780 
whole breed of porpoises has grown up
that<00:04:14.420> given<00:04:15.200> up<00:04:15.290> on<00:04:15.380> eyes<00:04:15.560> and<00:04:15.590> you<00:04:16.519> can<00:04:16.640> see

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
that given up on eyes and you can see

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.430 
that given up on eyes and you can see
that<00:04:16.820> here<00:04:17.269> they'd<00:04:17.720> be<00:04:17.750> absolutely<00:04:18.200> useless
