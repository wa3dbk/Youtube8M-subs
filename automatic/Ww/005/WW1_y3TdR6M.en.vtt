00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:11.810
 to sing 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.549
 hello hello I'm naruto 10 0388 and the day of 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.009
 today I bring a video that will deal with 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:18.470
 theories formulated by me regarding the 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.750
 story of now adventures before 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.490
 start with the theories I want to clarify 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.500
 that the theories that will be narrated to 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.330
 only continuations are assumptions and 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.759
 created by me so there's no need 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.500
 take any of the letter either 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.750
 I want them to come to me saying that I 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.630
 I'm inventing everything because as it says 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.659
 in the title alone are well theories 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.759
 let's start with theories theory first 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.429
 Marsans Lee may have existed in the 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.590
 past and met marcellini formulated 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:48.440
 this theory based on the bad chapter 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.159
 little boy and some others in this 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.319
 chapter 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.149
 Marshall claims to be the vampire king but 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:55.819
 in the normal eye world we know 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.530
 the vampire queen is marcelino this 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:59.360
 suggests the possibility that 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.490
 marcellini marshall met in the 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.259
 passed and will fight for the title of king 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.020
 of vampires because as we know 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.030
 all marcelín got that title 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.190
 defeating the previous vampire king and 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.079
 this may have been marshall hence 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.550
 marcelino at the time of narrating his version 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:15.080
 fiona's fid and what 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.690
 she knew very well their 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.610
 skills my second theory is that the 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.710
 marshall that represents marcelin in his 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.080
 story is not like it was marsans reads to 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.910
 one hundred percent but it is a mixture of 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.760
 how is marcelín and how was the real 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.740
 marshall and actually what I believe 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.540
 What marcelín does is mix memories 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.700
 of his past with the story of the king 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.770
 ice to be able to tell his past to 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.260
 someone without being noticed too that 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.180
 she was truly there, what 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.070
 does because it has always been very 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.230
 alone and deep down he just wants to have 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.210
 friends with whom to trust and tell their 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.280
 gone as we see in the chapter on 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.380
 marcelino's closet that tells his 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.480
 anguish to his diary or in the chapter 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:57.050
 Simon the sea ​​if by telling his story 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.790
 with simon pétrikov affiliate my third 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.230
 theory is about the possibility that 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.270
 some of the characters that appear 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.010
 in bad little boy are parents or 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.680
 relatives of the current characters 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.390
 like for example the lumpy prince who 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.790
 it could be the father or the grandfather of the 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.350
 clumsy princess or the goombay prince and 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.600
 there are many who say that possibly 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.880
 is the uncle of bo - level 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.830
 women who went out fighting at the party 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.300
 of the misty prince could be the 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.400
 mothers or grandmothers of the fight 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.400
 that appears in the memories chapter in 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.500
 the mountain bum bum and so on my 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.360
 fourth theory and the one that possibly is 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.370
 the most outlandish is the one that says that 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.290
 Fiona could actually be the mother 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.990
 biological end and that in turn be your 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.120
 healthy sane to explain this theory 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.250
 I must say that at no time has 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.200
 said that fiona is the only human to 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.390
 difference of purpose that they have said more 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.700
 times so one might think that 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.070
 apart from her there were more humans among 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.350
 them the end father in the storyboard 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.540
 from the chapter the link says that the father 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.580
 of end was locked in another dimension and 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.440
 got stuck there but that was the 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.200
 end and end mother if the end father 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:03.140
 was locked in there because he was locked 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.960
 there well in my opinion this is what 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.940
 happened fiona met some human of 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.470
 noble heart that became a 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.600
 bravo warrior who fought against 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.520
 humans that were evil or against 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.310
 evil monsters and even against 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.260
 both of them fell in love and had 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.630
 finally but shortly after being born 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.910
 he the enemies of the father of end were 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.950
 to look for him to get his revenge and 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.570
 this one in an attempt to save his beloved 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.520
 family sent them to look for 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.530
 shelter while he stayed to fight 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.700
 and that's where they sent him to another 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.650
 dimension 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.840
 Fiona escaped with the 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.000
 small end when they were reached by 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.830
 the enemies and fiona knowing that no 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.780
 could fight and take care of your child at 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.790
 same time decided to leave it 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.160
 temporarily somewhere remote 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.410
 in order to be able to kill the enemy without 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.390
 But something happened that made Fiona 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.670
 lose the fight and possibly the 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.620
 memory and sanity later it was 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.690
 found by someone who knew the 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.850
 home of the fish men and that because of 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.830
 his rabbit hat was confused with 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.660
 one of them and was taken to the hideout 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.030
 of these and while he was unconscious 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.710
 someone of the fish men changed his 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.680
 that's why he wears a different one 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.810
 Meanwhile the small end who 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.060
 had been left somewhere for his 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.500
 mother to protect it was found by 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.720
 the ghost woman of the episode 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.300
 chill but when I was still with 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.310
 life took him to his house to take care of 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.260
 him but it possibly happened a 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.150
 incident that caused it to fall to the sea 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.460
 and get lost while the woman 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:31.190
 he died but his ghost stayed wandering 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.780
 out there after this end was found 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.030
 by joshua and margaret 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.010
 this is more or less my theory about 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.960
 could have happened with the parents of finn 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:41.000
 and with the same purpose 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.400
 I keep reflecting on what could have been 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.889
 gone with cake but there may be 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.590
 dead also some other similarities 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:50.960
 between fiona and susana are her hair that 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.120
 two have it long and blond its way of 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.190
 fight since when fiona fights against 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.169
 the skeletons revived by marshall what 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.720
 It looks similar to how Susan does 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:01.760
 fight against the looks looks my fifth and 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.040
 last theory is about the possibility of 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.169
 that in effect the king he or she knew the 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.060
 true fiona and cake and that he is from 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:10.340
 some conscious way that something 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.590
 bad happened to them two so what 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:15.320
 is determined to find them because in 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.270
 truth is worried about them this 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.520
 explain why at the end of chapter 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.560
 bad little boy he said he knows that 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.110
 they are somewhere out there but that 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.090
 he could not find a way to find them for 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.400
 finish the video I want to discuss some 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:30.410
 theories that circulate on the internet like 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.270
 for example the theory that says that end 

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:34.190
 in part it has suffered a certain mutation 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.200
 because in the chapters end the 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.240
 human and jake the dog he was going out with a 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.889
 much more realistic face and in the world 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.159
 normal has no nose and his eyes 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:45.439
 they are two black dots, well, I think 

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:47.389
 that this theory is false because 

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:49.490
 the events that occurred in farm 

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:51.229
 world only develop in a world 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.210
 alternate, that is, they are not the ones 

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:55.039
 they really happened so 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:57.319
 we should rule out the possibility of 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:59.449
 which original purpose was mutated since 

00:06:57.319 --> 00:07:01.430
 the alternate end is that same an end 

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:03.740
 alternate that can not be considered real 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:05.749
 and therefore its characteristics 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:08.300
 physical ones like the nose or eyes too 

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:10.490
 they should be considered unreal 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.409
 also if they say that end does not have a nose 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:14.659
 no eyes because of the bomb that exploded already 

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:16.939
 the mutations that produced because simon 

00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:19.069
 pétrikov a human who lived before 

00:07:16.939 --> 00:07:21.139
 that the war began had the same 

00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:23.960
 physical characteristics that has the purpose 

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:25.849
 original I repeat that the world of the end more 

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.830
 Realistically develops in a world 

00:07:25.849 --> 00:07:29.750
 alternate and in an alternate world they can 

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:32.599
 change more things apart from what the 

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:35.150
 pump and well with this I just finish my video 

00:07:32.599 --> 00:07:38.150
 theories about time of adventures I here 

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:40.779
 I said goodbye and subscribe goodbye 

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.779
