this does have AI this does have the
standard<00:01:45.600> rotation<00:01:45.810> grooves<00:01:46.500> on<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:47.149> that's

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
standard rotation grooves on it that's

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.080 
standard rotation grooves on it that's
because<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.509> totally<00:01:49.380> forgot<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:50.219> didn't<00:01:50.909> make

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
because I totally forgot I didn't make

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.979 
because I totally forgot I didn't make
the<00:01:51.390> right<00:01:51.509> belt<00:01:51.810> for<00:01:52.079> this<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:53.689> you<00:01:54.689> know<00:01:54.780> the

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:54.989 
the right belt for this so you know the

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:56.990 
the right belt for this so you know the
grooves<00:01:55.259> are<00:01:55.470> in<00:01:55.619> wrong<00:01:55.860> rotation<00:01:56.459> for<00:01:56.849> what<00:01:56.970> I

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
grooves are in wrong rotation for what I

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.580 
grooves are in wrong rotation for what I
normally<00:01:57.119> do<00:01:57.539> is<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.840> know<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.079> got<00:01:58.259> some<00:01:58.500> of

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
normally do is so I know you got some of

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.510 
normally do is so I know you got some of
you<00:01:58.649> guys<00:01:58.799> will<00:01:59.009> catch<00:01:59.189> that<00:02:01.159> but<00:02:02.159> anyways

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
it's going to have the correct Bell on

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.709 
it's going to have the correct Bell on
it<00:02:04.709> after<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.009> make<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.399> we've<00:02:06.060> revamped<00:02:06.479> the

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
it after I make it we've revamped the

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.089 
it after I make it we've revamped the
bells<00:02:06.899> have<00:02:07.140> done<00:02:07.289> a<00:02:07.319> little<00:02:07.500> more<00:02:07.739> work<00:02:07.950> on

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
bells have done a little more work on

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.460 
bells have done a little more work on
them<00:02:08.369> so<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:09.000> have<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.539> slight<00:02:09.810> change<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.410> I

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
them so you have a slight change and I

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.869 
them so you have a slight change and I
just<00:02:10.649> didn't<00:02:10.890> remember<00:02:10.979> but<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.489> grooves<00:02:11.730> the

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
just didn't remember but the grooves the

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.830 
just didn't remember but the grooves the
right<00:02:12.030> orientation<00:02:13.250> so<00:02:14.250> anyways<00:02:14.940> I'm<00:02:15.690> going

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
right orientation so anyways I'm going

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.600 
right orientation so anyways I'm going
to<00:02:15.900> go<00:02:15.959> out<00:02:16.079> and<00:02:16.260> put<00:02:16.500> this<00:02:16.739> on<00:02:16.920> tripod<00:02:17.370> and

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
to go out and put this on tripod and

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.830 
to go out and put this on tripod and
we'll<00:02:17.940> make<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.090> hit<00:02:18.299> and<00:02:18.420> take<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.540> look<00:02:18.690> at<00:02:18.780> the

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
we'll make a hit and take a look at the

00:02:18.840 --> 00:03:40.400 
we'll make a hit and take a look at the
numbers

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.910 

all<00:03:41.410> right<00:03:42.240> looks<00:03:43.240> pretty<00:03:43.300> good

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
we've turned up the booth significantly

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:50.380 
we've turned up the booth significantly
from<00:03:47.720> what<00:03:47.870> it<00:03:47.959> was<00:03:48.050> last<00:03:48.349> year<00:03:48.680> and<00:03:49.390> cars

he turns fan on 5,000 is 12-15 6000 is

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:41.000 
he turns fan on 5,000 is 12-15 6000 is
1703<00:04:37.340> 7000<00:04:38.340> is<00:04:39.229> that's<00:04:40.229> blank<00:04:40.650> that's

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
1703 7000 is that's blank that's

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.240 
1703 7000 is that's blank that's
basically<00:04:41.370> 2200<00:04:42.330> got<00:04:42.570> 2278<00:04:43.440> but<00:04:43.650> they<00:04:44.040> really

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
basically 2200 got 2278 but they really

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.830 
basically 2200 got 2278 but they really
tell<00:04:44.400> the<00:04:44.550> blower<00:04:44.729> really<00:04:45.030> starts<00:04:45.270> picking<00:04:45.389> up

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
tell the blower really starts picking up

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.590 
tell the blower really starts picking up
all<00:04:45.990> right<00:04:46.199> through<00:04:46.410> here<00:04:47.120> with<00:04:48.120> the<00:04:48.210> gear<00:04:48.360> set

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
all right through here with the gear set

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:56.840 
all right through here with the gear set
that<00:04:48.780> we<00:04:48.870> have<00:04:49.020> in<00:04:49.229> it<00:04:49.610> and<00:04:52.940> 23:29<00:04:53.970> 76<00:04:55.010> 2060<00:04:56.010> 140

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
that we have in it and 23:29 76 2060 140

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.909 
that we have in it and 23:29 76 2060 140
and<00:04:56.970> it<00:04:57.120> does<00:04:57.270> just<00:04:57.780> start<00:04:58.050> nosing<00:04:58.289> over<00:04:58.650> here

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
and it does just start nosing over here

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:02.540 
and it does just start nosing over here
and<00:05:00.440> it's<00:05:01.440> probably<00:05:01.919> a<00:05:02.070> little<00:05:02.220> bit<00:05:02.460> of

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
and it's probably a little bit of

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.430 
and it's probably a little bit of
tune-up<00:05:02.940> related<00:05:03.360> i<00:05:03.419> can<00:05:03.600> go<00:05:03.750> after<00:05:03.900> tune<00:05:04.289> up

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
tune-up related i can go after tune up

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.960 
tune-up related i can go after tune up
quite<00:05:04.650> a<00:05:04.680> bit<00:05:04.860> more<00:05:05.039> it's<00:05:05.310> still<00:05:05.610> going<00:05:05.940> a

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
quite a bit more it's still going a

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.240 
quite a bit more it's still going a
little<00:05:06.150> little<00:05:07.080> rich<00:05:07.320> up<00:05:07.560> there<00:05:07.800> but<00:05:08.010> I<00:05:08.039> think
