00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.680
 brown rice 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.760
 Look, I'm going to use two cups of 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.680
 brown rice 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.360
 looks most come already washed those who 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.830
 do not see washed you can wash that 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.250
 usually in bulk 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.229
 I will also use sheets of laurel leaves 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.500
 of fresh laurel or dryness does not 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:27.110
 I'm going to use a problem and skip a 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.820
 average onion unit does not 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.190
 It needs to be that gigantic. 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.950
 I'll use three to four cloves of garlic 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.380
 fresh garlic please do not buy 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.700
 I sought and I use a little 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.310
 olive oil is good 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.710
 set the amount of rice water 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.170
 putting his hand inside the pot and 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.299
 squeezing the rice in the bottom go 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.060
 adding water until it reaches the 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:53.060
 back of your hand or other way of measuring 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.369
 the exact amount of water is to let 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.700
 it exceeded about two fingers of 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:01.670
 height of rice level over time 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.890
 You'll know how to water the water just by looking. 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.170
 so let's remember to recap the 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.020
 people are going to put the rice to put water 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:13.130
 the seasonings will then boil 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:15.230
 until the water goes down and get 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.569
 rice also after the water 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.980
 arrived at the abuse i can cover dino 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.739
 commitment fire and leave finished 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.900
 but Felipe did not work out and it got tough 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.180
 So go for this rice and let 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.159

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.590

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.049
 more or less this way then I 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.690

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:10.079
 gets the rice is a package is not only 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:13.109
 a book so that's not a package 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:16.109
 competitive with vitamins with websites with 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:21.269
 a little fat proteins and 60 and 70 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:24.150
 all facilitated so that the spinning body 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.040
 that metabolizes that of the best 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.389
 possible way and take advantage of the 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.980
 best possible way 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:33.269
 if you start to take tune 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.919
 metabolism becomes more difficult because 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.500
 is missing vitamins is missing 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:39.959

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.459
 work and he imagines where 'it's' 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.930

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:52.319
 these elements that cause 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:53.519
 decrease the mineral and mineral complexes and
