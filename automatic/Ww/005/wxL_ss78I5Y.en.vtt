00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:08.670
 hello super racing 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.580
 What are we going to do today a rocket? 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.460
 Let's travel with our imagination. 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.210
 what do we need the cardboard tube 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.880
 colored papers glue scissors without 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.640
 the colored markers that 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.010
 round plastic sheet with more or 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.640
 at least 15 centimeters 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.900
 all ready let's start lining pipe 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.390
 of cardboard 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.660
 choose a paper of the color you like most 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.440
 in khost and mark the distance with pencil 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.610
 so after cutting the paper following 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:48.270
 direction jacques martin this way 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:51.899
 wrap the tube and cut the leftover paper 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.870
 bacci glue on the wheels of the paper and a little 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:58.199
 inside and outside the tube with the 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.379
 Let's cut our paper. 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.559
 well-colored rocket cut some strips 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.439
 paper and glue on the base of the tube in the middle. 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.990
 5 and it that way 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.320
 Next, let's draw the little windows. 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.650
 rocket use colored paper of 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.880
 other thighs say with rekot 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.990
 carefully choosing on the rocket to 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.150
 make the tip 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.600
 Let's use the plastic cover to 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.939
 do a circus on paper 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.950
 let's remember that folding in the middle to 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.430
 make a mark like that 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.490
 now remember the circle half face glue 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:42.110
 on the edge and join both sides to 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.000
 form the tip of our rocket 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.439
 hold the glue fingers slightly 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.380
 stand firm 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:52.770
 now let's cut four strips of paper 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.530
 and glue them on the inside of tube 9 as 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.869
 tips out face lap in all of them 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:02.450
 and on rocket fico cheese 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.640
 sensational to complete x in clipping 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.100
 some flames using red paper 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.229
 orange and yellow 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.840
 put the base on the rocket so it 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.950
 can fly very quickly through space 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.709
 sidereal
