00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.290 
Elijah but anyways so I have this hidden
Tesla<00:01:01.530> here<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.579> actually<00:01:02.730> helps<00:01:03.149> out<00:01:03.270> a

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
Tesla here and it actually helps out a

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.960 
Tesla here and it actually helps out a
lot<00:01:03.390> because<00:01:03.840> people<00:01:04.799> get<00:01:05.070> pissed<00:01:05.309> because<00:01:05.610> a

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
lot because people get pissed because a

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.719 
lot because people get pissed because a
hidden<00:01:06.510> Tesla<00:01:06.840> pops<00:01:07.049> up<00:01:07.320> they<00:01:07.830> send<00:01:08.189> like

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
hidden Tesla pops up they send like

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.330 
hidden Tesla pops up they send like
three<00:01:09.030> Giants<00:01:09.450> down<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.619> giant<00:01:10.950> kills<00:01:11.159> it

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
three Giants down and the giant kills it

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.890 
three Giants down and the giant kills it
and<00:01:11.460> then<00:01:11.880> they<00:01:12.000> run<00:01:12.240> through<00:01:12.450> these<00:01:12.600> two

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
and then they run through these two

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.170 
and then they run through these two
little<00:01:13.880> to<00:01:15.200> level<00:01:16.200> six<00:01:16.439> walls<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.909> spring

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
little to level six walls and the spring

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.390 
little to level six walls and the spring
trap<00:01:18.479> pops<00:01:18.840> them<00:01:19.049> up<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.470> those<00:01:19.890> are<00:01:20.070> useless

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
trap pops them up and those are useless

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.609 
trap pops them up and those are useless
so<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.479> just<00:01:21.509> gets<00:01:21.869> rid<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.200> couple<00:01:22.350> of

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
so that just gets rid of a couple of

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.130 
so that just gets rid of a couple of
them<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.890> then<00:01:23.759> usually<00:01:24.390> they<00:01:24.540> send<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.930> couple

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
them and then usually they send a couple

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.120 
them and then usually they send a couple
wall<00:01:25.409> breakers<00:01:25.770> right<00:01:26.159> here<00:01:26.790> on<00:01:26.970> this<00:01:27.090> wall

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
wall breakers right here on this wall

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.910 
wall breakers right here on this wall
maybe<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.310> can<00:01:29.610> get<00:01:29.759> like<00:01:29.909> Walt<00:01:30.509> bombs<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.650> to

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
maybe I can get like Walt bombs and to

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.590 
maybe I can get like Walt bombs and to
show<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.189> they<00:01:32.700> send<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:32.970> couple<00:01:33.119> like<00:01:33.390> right

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
show you they send a couple like right

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.749 
show you they send a couple like right

by<00:01:56.189> these<00:01:56.369> two<00:01:56.579> mortars<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.829> what's<00:01:58.829> really

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
by these two mortars and what's really

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.219 
by these two mortars and what's really
nice<00:01:59.189> is<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.490> usually<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.360> Giants<00:02:00.840> kill

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
nice is that usually the Giants kill

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.990 
nice is that usually the Giants kill
both<00:02:01.380> these<00:02:01.590> things<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.610> they<00:02:02.700> don't<00:02:02.790> usually

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
both these things and they don't usually

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.499 
both these things and they don't usually
go<00:02:03.270> for<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.540> mortar<00:02:03.899> they<00:02:04.409> go<00:02:04.560> for<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:04.979> all

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
go for the mortar they go for it all

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.180 
go for the mortar they go for it all
three<00:02:06.509> of<00:02:06.540> these<00:02:06.689> things<00:02:07.049> on<00:02:07.350> either<00:02:07.530> side<00:02:07.890> all

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
three of these things on either side all

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.229 
three of these things on either side all
three<00:02:08.700> defensive<00:02:09.119> buildings<00:02:09.270> like<00:02:10.110> over<00:02:10.410> here

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
three defensive buildings like over here

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.580 
three defensive buildings like over here
and<00:02:12.239> over<00:02:12.450> here

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
and over here

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.070 
and over here
so<00:02:13.790> what<00:02:14.790> I<00:02:14.819> did<00:02:14.940> was<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.540> kind<00:02:15.720> of<00:02:15.780> made<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.019> a

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
so what I did was I kind of made it a

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.040 
so what I did was I kind of made it a
little<00:02:16.230> bit<00:02:16.410> of<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:17.010> funnel<00:02:17.370> so<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.540> put<00:02:18.959> it

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
little bit of a funnel so I put it

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.990 
little bit of a funnel so I put it
opening<00:02:19.440> right<00:02:19.620> here<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:20.550> I<00:02:20.610> put<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:20.819> spring

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
opening right here and I put a spring

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.610 
opening right here and I put a spring
trap<00:02:21.269> right<00:02:21.450> here<00:02:21.510> so<00:02:21.840> all<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:22.110> Giants<00:02:22.290> would

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
trap right here so all the Giants would

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.270 
trap right here so all the Giants would
they<00:02:23.040> flow<00:02:23.400> into<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:24.650> little<00:02:25.650> area<00:02:26.040> where<00:02:26.250> I

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
they flow into the little area where I

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.670 
they flow into the little area where I
had<00:02:26.489> the<00:02:26.700> three<00:02:27.060> defensive<00:02:27.750> buildings<00:02:28.260> and

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
had the three defensive buildings and

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.309 
had the three defensive buildings and
they<00:02:29.340> get<00:02:29.640> sprung<00:02:30.000> up<00:02:30.209> and<00:02:30.390> say<00:02:30.959> I'm<00:02:31.019> on<00:02:31.170> this

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
they get sprung up and say I'm on this

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.490 
they get sprung up and say I'm on this
side<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:31.970> what<00:02:32.970> I've<00:02:33.060> noticed<00:02:33.299> is<00:02:33.660> that<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:34.170> lot

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
side and what I've noticed is that a lot

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.250 
side and what I've noticed is that a lot
of<00:02:34.560> people<00:02:34.680> don't<00:02:35.250> attack<00:02:35.549> on<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.879> side

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
of people don't attack on the side

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.449 
of people don't attack on the side
probably<00:02:37.260> because<00:02:37.650> there's<00:02:38.040> not<00:02:38.190> much

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
probably because there's not much

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.050 
probably because there's not much
resources<00:02:39.000> on<00:02:39.269> the<00:02:39.390> Sun<00:02:39.629> yet<00:02:40.700> I'm<00:02:41.700> upgrading

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
resources on the Sun yet I'm upgrading

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.949 
resources on the Sun yet I'm upgrading
these<00:02:42.540> two<00:02:42.840> side<00:02:43.170> ones<00:02:43.410> mostly<00:02:44.099> because<00:02:44.390> a<00:02:45.390> lot

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
these two side ones mostly because a lot

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.690 
these two side ones mostly because a lot
of<00:02:45.989> people<00:02:46.079> come<00:02:46.500> from<00:02:46.650> up<00:02:46.829> here<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.250> usually

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
of people come from up here and usually

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.330 
of people come from up here and usually
they<00:02:48.060> can<00:02:48.349> if<00:02:49.349> they're<00:02:49.560> lucky<00:02:49.739> they<00:02:50.069> can<00:02:50.220> get

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
they can if they're lucky they can get

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.020 
they can if they're lucky they can get
these<00:02:50.519> two<00:02:50.760> right<00:02:51.120> here<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.829> uh<00:02:52.829> if<00:02:53.489> I<00:02:53.819> have

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
these two right here and uh if I have

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.759 
these two right here and uh if I have
these<00:02:54.269> fully<00:02:54.569> upgraded<00:02:55.079> these<00:02:55.440> will<00:02:55.620> hold

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
these fully upgraded these will hold

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.059 
these fully upgraded these will hold
more<00:02:56.360> which<00:02:57.360> makes<00:02:57.750> when<00:02:58.440> they<00:02:58.560> attack<00:02:58.860> these

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
more which makes when they attack these

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.539 
more which makes when they attack these
they<00:02:59.459> get<00:02:59.670> less<00:02:59.849> loot<00:03:00.120> pretty<00:03:00.629> much<00:03:00.780> so<00:03:01.650> that's

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
they get less loot pretty much so that's

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.720 
they get less loot pretty much so that's
a<00:03:02.819> plus<00:03:03.410> Leslie<00:03:04.410> they<00:03:04.590> get<00:03:04.799> the<00:03:05.099> more<00:03:05.280> I<00:03:05.340> get<00:03:05.579> to

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
this side since uh Wahlburgers new AI is

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.150 
this side since uh Wahlburgers new AI is
kind<00:04:00.419> of<00:04:00.540> different<00:04:00.690> they<00:04:01.620> usually<00:04:01.950> go<00:04:02.099> for

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
kind of different they usually go for

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.949 
kind of different they usually go for
the<00:04:02.430> one<00:04:02.579> that<00:04:02.730> only<00:04:02.910> has<00:04:03.090> like<00:04:03.269> one<00:04:03.510> wall<00:04:03.750> or

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
the one that only has like one wall or

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.229 
the one that only has like one wall or
whatever<00:04:04.230> ah<00:04:04.609> I'm<00:04:05.609> pretty<00:04:05.880> sure<00:04:05.970> that's<00:04:06.120> how

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
whatever ah I'm pretty sure that's how

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.180 
whatever ah I'm pretty sure that's how
it<00:04:06.299> works<00:04:06.450> at<00:04:06.630> least<00:04:06.660> well<00:04:07.530> anyways<00:04:07.829> I<00:04:08.040> got

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
it works at least well anyways I got

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.159 
it works at least well anyways I got
three<00:04:08.519> wall<00:04:08.700> right<00:04:08.940> here<00:04:08.970> so<00:04:09.450> if<00:04:09.870> for<00:04:10.139> some

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
three wall right here so if for some

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:11.780 
three wall right here so if for some
reason<00:04:10.319> they<00:04:10.859> actually<00:04:11.190> send<00:04:11.430> a<00:04:11.459> wall<00:04:11.639> brick

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
reason they actually send a wall brick

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.699 
reason they actually send a wall brick
right<00:04:11.940> here<00:04:12.030> it<00:04:12.359> can<00:04:12.810> only<00:04:12.930> destroy<00:04:13.319> two<00:04:13.560> of

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
right here it can only destroy two of

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.319 
right here it can only destroy two of
them<00:04:13.829> because<00:04:14.250> that's<00:04:14.370> one<00:04:14.819> of<00:04:14.910> the<00:04:15.000> new<00:04:15.120> wall

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
them because that's one of the new wall

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:17.900 
them because that's one of the new wall
breaker<00:04:15.540> techniques<00:04:16.079> as<00:04:16.289> well<00:04:16.549> so<00:04:17.549> they<00:04:17.789> can

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
breaker techniques as well so they can

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.520 
breaker techniques as well so they can
only<00:04:17.970> get<00:04:18.209> two<00:04:18.359> of<00:04:18.389> them<00:04:18.599> so<00:04:18.840> they<00:04:18.959> have<00:04:19.109> to<00:04:19.289> at

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
only get two of them so they have to at

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.500 
only get two of them so they have to at
least<00:04:19.590> send<00:04:20.190> another<00:04:20.639> wall<00:04:20.849> breaker<00:04:21.090> to

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
least send another wall breaker to

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.360 
least send another wall breaker to
destroy<00:04:21.810> the<00:04:21.930> gold<00:04:22.169> one<00:04:22.380> which<00:04:22.950> means<00:04:23.219> they

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
destroy the gold one which means they

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.580 
destroy the gold one which means they
have<00:04:23.460> to<00:04:23.490> send<00:04:23.700> two<00:04:23.940> more<00:04:24.150> if<00:04:24.510> that<00:04:25.409> makes

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
have to send two more if that makes

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.870 
have to send two more if that makes
sense<00:04:25.740> to<00:04:25.890> you<00:04:26.130> it<00:04:26.610> makes

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
sense to you it makes

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.200 
sense to you it makes
haha<00:04:27.570> but<00:04:28.380> if<00:04:28.680> they<00:04:29.130> send<00:04:29.370> one<00:04:29.490> over<00:04:29.700> here<00:04:30.000> it

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
haha but if they send one over here it

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.380 
haha but if they send one over here it
might<00:04:30.420> go<00:04:30.690> right<00:04:30.900> here<00:04:31.260> to<00:04:31.290> this<00:04:31.590> corner<00:04:31.830> and

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
might go right here to this corner and

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.910 
might go right here to this corner and
destroy<00:04:33.390> that<00:04:33.630> you<00:04:33.870> can<00:04:34.290> get<00:04:34.440> into<00:04:34.590> two

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
destroy that you can get into two

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.160 
destroy that you can get into two
sections<00:04:35.160> which<00:04:35.670> I<00:04:35.760> don't<00:04:35.970> want<00:04:36.240> so<00:04:36.990> therefore

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170 
sections which I don't want so therefore

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.330 
sections which I don't want so therefore
spring-trap<00:04:38.070> and<00:04:38.990> no<00:04:39.990> more<00:04:40.260> huncle<00:04:41.160> wall

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
spring-trap and no more huncle wall

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.730 
spring-trap and no more huncle wall
breaker<00:04:41.550> and<00:04:42.120> I<00:04:42.900> got<00:04:43.020> the<00:04:43.140> same<00:04:43.290> thing<00:04:43.530> on<00:04:43.650> this

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
breaker and I got the same thing on this

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.760 
breaker and I got the same thing on this
side<00:04:44.210> and<00:04:46.160> yeah<00:04:47.160> so<00:04:47.580> I<00:04:48.110> think<00:04:49.110> that's

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
side and yeah so I think that's

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.640 
side and yeah so I think that's
everything<00:04:50.180> it's<00:04:51.180> a<00:04:51.930> pretty<00:04:52.230> slick-looking

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
everything it's a pretty slick-looking

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.210 
everything it's a pretty slick-looking
base<00:04:53.190> um<00:04:53.550> I<00:04:54.620> mean<00:04:55.620> it<00:04:55.740> can<00:04:55.830> always<00:04:55.890> be<00:04:56.070> better

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
base um I mean it can always be better

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.920 
base um I mean it can always be better
from<00:04:57.030> upgrades<00:04:58.370> my<00:04:59.370> recommendation<00:04:59.760> is<00:05:00.540> if

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
from upgrades my recommendation is if

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.780 
from upgrades my recommendation is if
you're<00:05:01.410> gonna<00:05:01.530> upgrade<00:05:01.770> your<00:05:02.130> mortars<00:05:02.520> with

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
you're gonna upgrade your mortars with

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.590 
you're gonna upgrade your mortars with
this<00:05:02.940> base<00:05:03.260> never<00:05:04.260> upgrade<00:05:04.920> this<00:05:05.100> one<00:05:05.600> like

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
this base never upgrade this one like

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.420 
this base never upgrade this one like
upgrade<00:05:07.140> one<00:05:07.320> of<00:05:07.410> the<00:05:07.500> side<00:05:07.680> ones<00:05:07.920> and<00:05:08.190> then

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
upgrade one of the side ones and then

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.390 
upgrade one of the side ones and then
like<00:05:09.210> switch<00:05:09.480> them<00:05:09.660> because<00:05:10.530> if<00:05:10.800> this<00:05:11.160> one<00:05:11.370> is

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
like switch them because if this one is

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.210 
like switch them because if this one is
the<00:05:11.670> best<00:05:11.850> more<00:05:12.150> you<00:05:12.360> have<00:05:12.540> put<00:05:13.290> it<00:05:13.380> there<00:05:13.410> like

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
the best more you have put it there like

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.590 
the best more you have put it there like
if<00:05:14.370> you<00:05:14.460> have<00:05:14.580> a<00:05:14.610> little<00:05:14.910> six<00:05:15.120> mortar<00:05:15.480> or

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
if you have a little six mortar or

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.990 
if you have a little six mortar or
whatever<00:05:15.870> or<00:05:16.650> whatever<00:05:16.860> your<00:05:17.220> best<00:05:17.460> mortar<00:05:17.850> is

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
whatever or whatever your best mortar is

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.960 
whatever or whatever your best mortar is
put<00:05:18.930> that<00:05:19.080> there<00:05:19.260> because<00:05:19.920> like<00:05:20.190> I<00:05:20.340> said<00:05:20.400> they

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
put that there because like I said they

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.560

all<00:05:21.180> come<00:05:21.630> from<00:05:21.810> the<00:05:21.960> side<00:05:22.170> I<00:05:22.970> I<00:05:23.970> might<00:05:24.420> have

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570
