let's<00:01:47.610> get<00:01:47.759> into<00:01:48.030> what<00:01:48.060> they<00:01:48.360> actually<00:01:48.540> do

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
let's get into what they actually do

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.969 
let's get into what they actually do
with<00:01:48.960> these<00:01:49.079> little<00:01:49.200> charts<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.649> made<00:01:49.829> right

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
with these little charts I made right

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.200 
with these little charts I made right
here<00:01:50.009> we'll<00:01:50.250> start<00:01:50.399> with<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.610> target<00:01:51.030> finder

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
here we'll start with the target finder

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.569 
here we'll start with the target finder
as<00:01:51.540> we<00:01:52.020> did<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.380> first<00:01:52.530> thing<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.009> what<00:01:53.490> it

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
as we did the first thing so what it

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.190 
as we did the first thing so what it
does<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:54.000> highlights<00:01:54.119> enemies<00:01:54.689> with<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.899> red

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
does is it highlights enemies with a red

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.330 
does is it highlights enemies with a red
diamond<00:01:55.619> in<00:01:56.040> your<00:01:56.100> like<00:01:57.060> target<00:01:57.630> finder<00:01:57.840> scope

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
diamond in your like target finder scope

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.410 
diamond in your like target finder scope
which<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.430> really<00:01:59.670> cool<00:01:59.790> as<00:01:59.969> you<00:02:00.060> can<00:02:00.180> see<00:02:00.329> on

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
which is really cool as you can see on

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.880 
which is really cool as you can see on
the<00:02:00.479> screen<00:02:00.540> right<00:02:00.750> here<00:02:00.810> you're<00:02:01.049> like<00:02:01.200> shows

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
the screen right here you're like shows

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.139 
the screen right here you're like shows

highlights and it's pretty cool and it
notifies<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.219> when<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.430> enemy<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.759> inside<00:02:06.000> as

notifies you when the enemy is inside as

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.399 
notifies you when the enemy is inside as
you<00:02:06.390> can<00:02:06.420> see<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.750> crosshairs

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
you can see the crosshairs

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.499 
you can see the crosshairs
they<00:02:07.710> are<00:02:07.860> blue<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.610> then<00:02:08.729> one<00:02:08.879> that<00:02:09.060> goes

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
they are blue and then one that goes

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.089 
they are blue and then one that goes
over<00:02:09.840> an<00:02:09.929> enemy<00:02:10.080> they<00:02:10.379> turn<00:02:10.560> red<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:10.979> make<00:02:11.069> a

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
over an enemy they turn red and make a

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.449 
over an enemy they turn red and make a
little<00:02:11.280> noise<00:02:11.489> so<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:11.819> know<00:02:12.030> one

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
little noise so you know one

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.369 
little noise so you know one
it's<00:02:13.000> really<00:02:13.299> cool<00:02:13.480> to<00:02:13.599> track<00:02:13.810> enemies<00:02:14.170> and

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 
it's really cool to track enemies and

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.110 
it's really cool to track enemies and
all<00:02:14.590> that<00:02:14.739> good<00:02:14.890> stuff<00:02:14.920> and<00:02:15.250> also<00:02:15.640> it's<00:02:15.819> a<00:02:15.879> zoom

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
all that good stuff and also it's a zoom

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.000 
all that good stuff and also it's a zoom
site<00:02:16.450> which<00:02:16.989> also<00:02:17.260> gives<00:02:17.409> you<00:02:17.500> tunnel<00:02:17.799> vision

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
site which also gives you tunnel vision

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
site which also gives you tunnel vision
which<00:02:18.159> we'll<00:02:18.250> talk<00:02:18.340> about<00:02:18.489> in<00:02:18.670> a<00:02:18.700> little<00:02:18.790> bit

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
which we'll talk about in a little bit

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.660 
which we'll talk about in a little bit
and<00:02:19.390> it<00:02:19.780> very<00:02:20.379> I<00:02:20.500> mean<00:02:20.980> it<00:02:21.250> increases<00:02:21.640> your

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
and it very I mean it increases your

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.330 
and it very I mean it increases your
reduces<00:02:22.540> your<00:02:22.659> recoil<00:02:22.930> increases<00:02:23.650> it<00:02:24.010> reduces

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
reduces your recoil increases it reduces

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.580 
reduces your recoil increases it reduces
your<00:02:24.459> recoil<00:02:24.760> by<00:02:24.969> a<00:02:25.000> lot<00:02:25.269> and<00:02:25.780> I<00:02:26.260> just<00:02:26.469> said

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
your recoil by a lot and I just said

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.050 
your recoil by a lot and I just said
gives<00:02:26.859> you<00:02:26.950> a<00:02:27.010> plus<00:02:27.189> one<00:02:27.340> point<00:02:27.519> of<00:02:27.700> range

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
gives you a plus one point of range

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.240 
gives you a plus one point of range
which<00:02:28.510> is<00:02:28.810> quote<00:02:29.319> quote<00:02:29.530> cuz<00:02:29.769> I'm<00:02:29.920> not<00:02:30.040> even

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
which is quote quote cuz I'm not even

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.470 
which is quote quote cuz I'm not even
sure<00:02:30.370> if<00:02:30.459> I<00:02:30.519> didn't<00:02:30.730> even<00:02:30.819> test<00:02:31.060> that<00:02:31.209> because

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
sure if I didn't even test that because

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.690 
sure if I didn't even test that because
as<00:02:31.659> I<00:02:31.750> did<00:02:31.959> in<00:02:32.049> the<00:02:32.139> last<00:02:32.170> video<00:02:32.500> range<00:02:33.430> isn't

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
as I did in the last video range isn't

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.069 
as I did in the last video range isn't
really<00:02:34.030> something<00:02:34.239> you<00:02:34.389> can<00:02:34.480> test<00:02:34.689> with<00:02:34.840> these

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
really something you can test with these

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:38.129 
really something you can test with these
um<00:02:35.730> it's<00:02:36.730> not<00:02:36.879> really<00:02:37.150> important<00:02:37.629> with<00:02:37.959> the

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:38.139 
um it's not really important with the

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:40.259 
um it's not really important with the
damage<00:02:38.859> and<00:02:38.950> all<00:02:39.040> that<00:02:39.159> stuff<00:02:39.340> so<00:02:39.849> some<00:02:40.030> pros

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
damage and all that stuff so some pros

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:41.940 
damage and all that stuff so some pros
of<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.599> target<00:02:40.900> finder<00:02:41.079> again<00:02:41.620> I<00:02:41.650> said<00:02:41.769> a

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
of the target finder again I said a

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.349 
of the target finder again I said a
highlights<00:02:42.340> enemies<00:02:42.700> and<00:02:42.819> that<00:02:42.909> you<00:02:43.000> notify

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:43.359 
highlights enemies and that you notify

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:45.420 
highlights enemies and that you notify
when<00:02:44.170> they're<00:02:44.319> in<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:44.560> site<00:02:44.799> and<00:02:45.040> it<00:02:45.220> gives

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
when they're in the site and it gives

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.979 
when they're in the site and it gives
you<00:02:45.579> zoom<00:02:45.849> and<00:02:46.120> gives<00:02:46.329> you<00:02:46.450> reduced<00:02:46.780> recoil

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
you zoom and gives you reduced recoil

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.960 
you zoom and gives you reduced recoil
and<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.829> only<00:02:47.980> con<00:02:48.220> with<00:02:48.430> it<00:02:48.549> is<00:02:48.669> they<00:02:48.790> give

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
and the only con with it is they give

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.280 
and the only con with it is they give
you<00:02:49.120> little<00:02:49.419> peripheral<00:02:49.780> vision<00:02:50.139> or<00:02:50.260> the

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
you little peripheral vision or the

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.830 
you little peripheral vision or the
tonal<00:02:50.620> vision<00:02:50.709> so<00:02:51.519> like<00:02:52.090> you're<00:02:52.359> looking

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
tonal vision so like you're looking

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.569 
tonal vision so like you're looking
straight<00:02:53.169> forward<00:02:53.500> you<00:02:53.530> have<00:02:53.680> no<00:02:53.919> side<00:02:54.280> vision

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
straight forward you have no side vision

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.030 
straight forward you have no side vision
in<00:02:55.030> columns<00:02:55.780> and<00:02:55.959> you<00:02:56.319> have<00:02:56.409> no<00:02:56.560> side<00:02:56.829> vision

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
in columns and you have no side vision

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.009 
in columns and you have no side vision
and<00:02:57.280> call<00:02:57.430> duty<00:02:57.639> no<00:02:57.879> blood<00:02:58.209> flow<00:02:58.389> area<00:02:58.810> we<00:02:58.900> can

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
and call duty no blood flow area we can

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.839 
and call duty no blood flow area we can
see<00:02:59.169> enemies<00:02:59.530> and<00:03:00.069> basically<00:03:00.459> all<00:03:00.579> I<00:03:00.609> can<00:03:00.760> do

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
see enemies and basically all I can do

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.209 
see enemies and basically all I can do
is<00:03:00.969> look<00:03:01.180> forward<00:03:01.709> so<00:03:02.709> that's<00:03:02.799> that<00:03:02.980> now<00:03:03.129> we'll

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:03.219 
is look forward so that's that now we'll

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:04.979 
is look forward so that's that now we'll
go<00:03:03.310> on<00:03:03.430> to<00:03:03.549> the<00:03:03.669> millimeter<00:03:04.060> scanner<00:03:04.359> the

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
go on to the millimeter scanner the

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.390 
go on to the millimeter scanner the
millimeter<00:03:05.409> scanner<00:03:05.709> lets<00:03:06.010> you<00:03:06.069> see<00:03:06.219> through

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
millimeter scanner lets you see through

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.879 
millimeter scanner lets you see through
walls<00:03:06.549> objects<00:03:07.209> in<00:03:07.299> smoke<00:03:07.629> within<00:03:07.989> 25<00:03:08.650> meters

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:08.889 
walls objects in smoke within 25 meters

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:11.490 
walls objects in smoke within 25 meters
it<00:03:09.280> has<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.549> be<00:03:09.669> up<00:03:09.760> to<00:03:09.849> 25<00:03:10.239> meters<00:03:10.419> it<00:03:11.109> scans

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
it has to be up to 25 meters it scans

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.229 
it has to be up to 25 meters it scans
every<00:03:11.829> 2<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.040> 3<00:03:12.219> seconds<00:03:12.760> and<00:03:12.849> has<00:03:13.000> that<00:03:13.090> little

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
every 2 to 3 seconds and has that little

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.360 
every 2 to 3 seconds and has that little
nice<00:03:13.480> like<00:03:13.689> gritty<00:03:14.109> scan<00:03:14.620> look<00:03:14.859> it<00:03:15.129> looks

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
nice like gritty scan look it looks

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.149 
nice like gritty scan look it looks
really<00:03:15.700> cool<00:03:15.969> I<00:03:16.209> like<00:03:16.659> it<00:03:16.900> and<00:03:17.159> something

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:18.159 
really cool I like it and something

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:20.129 
really cool I like it and something
interesting<00:03:18.579> is<00:03:18.669> it<00:03:18.819> zooms<00:03:19.060> in<00:03:19.299> less<00:03:19.599> than<00:03:19.900> the

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
interesting is it zooms in less than the

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:21.599 
interesting is it zooms in less than the
iron<00:03:20.560> sights<00:03:20.859> like<00:03:21.069> if<00:03:21.250> you're<00:03:21.370> just<00:03:21.459> looking

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
iron sights like if you're just looking

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.610 
iron sights like if you're just looking
with<00:03:21.849> the<00:03:21.940> iron<00:03:22.180> sights<00:03:22.419> down<00:03:22.659> like<00:03:23.319> looking

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
with the iron sights down like looking

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.080 
with the iron sights down like looking
down<00:03:23.769> the<00:03:23.889> iron<00:03:24.159> sights<00:03:24.370> of<00:03:24.519> your<00:03:24.639> gun<00:03:24.879> it

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
down the iron sights of your gun it

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.180 
down the iron sights of your gun it
actually<00:03:25.569> zooms<00:03:26.199> in<00:03:26.440> less<00:03:26.680> than<00:03:26.799> that<00:03:26.949> so<00:03:27.010> you

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
actually zooms in less than that so you

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.240 
actually zooms in less than that so you
have<00:03:27.370> more<00:03:27.549> peripheral<00:03:28.060> vision<00:03:28.389> and<00:03:29.250> it's

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
have more peripheral vision and it's

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.309 
have more peripheral vision and it's
easier<00:03:30.549> to<00:03:30.639> see<00:03:30.760> enemies<00:03:30.909> and<00:03:31.359> as<00:03:31.750> I<00:03:32.049> said<00:03:32.109> it

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
easier to see enemies and as I said it

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.129 
easier to see enemies and as I said it
gives<00:03:32.409> you<00:03:32.560> a<00:03:32.729> minus<00:03:33.729> 1<00:03:33.939> point<00:03:34.209> of<00:03:34.359> accuracy<00:03:34.780> in

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139 
gives you a minus 1 point of accuracy in

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:37.319 
gives you a minus 1 point of accuracy in
quilting<00:03:35.530> and<00:03:35.650> because<00:03:35.889> no<00:03:36.879> that's<00:03:37.120> not

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
quilting and because no that's not

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.839 
quilting and because no that's not
always<00:03:37.629> true<00:03:37.840> so<00:03:38.280> pros<00:03:39.280> again<00:03:39.579> you<00:03:39.699> see

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:39.849 
always true so pros again you see

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:41.580 
always true so pros again you see
through<00:03:40.060> objects<00:03:40.479> which<00:03:40.659> is<00:03:40.689> cool<00:03:41.019> more

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
through objects which is cool more

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.319 
through objects which is cool more
peripheral<00:03:42.040> vision<00:03:42.400> like<00:03:42.819> you<00:03:42.970> get<00:03:43.120> more

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
peripheral vision like you get more

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.149 
peripheral vision like you get more
awareness<00:03:43.659> around<00:03:44.169> its<00:03:44.349> R<00:03:44.409> equal<00:03:44.799> that's<00:03:44.949> kind

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:45.159 
awareness around its R equal that's kind

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:47.309 
awareness around its R equal that's kind
of<00:03:45.220> a<00:03:45.310> cool<00:03:45.519> thing<00:03:45.579> with<00:03:45.909> the<00:03:46.030> scope<00:03:46.239> and<00:03:46.959> how

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
of a cool thing with the scope and how

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:48.960 
of a cool thing with the scope and how
its<00:03:47.470> enemies<00:03:47.889> which<00:03:48.069> is<00:03:48.220> like<00:03:48.400> when<00:03:48.579> it<00:03:48.699> scans

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
its enemies which is like when it scans

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.429 
its enemies which is like when it scans
actually<00:03:49.419> highlights<00:03:49.720> the<00:03:49.780> enemy<00:03:50.049> in<00:03:50.169> a<00:03:50.229> white

00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:50.439 
actually highlights the enemy in a white

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:51.899 
actually highlights the enemy in a white
outline<00:03:50.650> which<00:03:50.979> is<00:03:51.129> kind<00:03:51.400> of<00:03:51.430> cool<00:03:51.579> kind<00:03:51.819> of

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:51.909 
outline which is kind of cool kind of

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:52.949 
outline which is kind of cool kind of
helps<00:03:52.060> you<00:03:52.090> all<00:03:52.239> kind<00:03:52.419> of<00:03:52.449> like<00:03:52.569> the<00:03:52.659> target

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
helps you all kind of like the target

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.080 
helps you all kind of like the target
finder<00:03:53.139> and<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:54.280> only<00:03:54.489> cons<00:03:54.729> I<00:03:54.849> got<00:03:55.000> right

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
finder and the only cons I got right

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.240 
finder and the only cons I got right
here<00:03:55.120> is<00:03:55.479> it<00:03:55.659> does<00:03:56.139> have<00:03:56.319> increased<00:03:56.709> recoil<00:03:56.919> on

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
here is it does have increased recoil on

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.069 
here is it does have increased recoil on
some<00:03:57.549> weapons<00:03:57.909> I<00:03:58.120> mean<00:03:58.540> you'll<00:03:58.780> see<00:03:58.840> in<00:03:59.019> a

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
some weapons I mean you'll see in a

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:00.420 
some weapons I mean you'll see in a
little<00:03:59.290> bit<00:03:59.409> that<00:03:59.439> these<00:03:59.859> things<00:04:00.159> aren't

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
little bit that these things aren't

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.969 
little bit that these things aren't
consistent<00:04:01.090> for<00:04:01.239> each<00:04:01.359> weapon<00:04:01.569> and<00:04:01.930> the<00:04:02.799> only

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:02.979 
consistent for each weapon and the only

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:04.469 
consistent for each weapon and the only
another<00:04:03.099> con<00:04:03.340> is<00:04:03.370> the<00:04:03.489> last<00:04:03.759> attachment

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:04.479 
another con is the last attachment

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
we get into the data also one thing you

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.540 
we get into the data also one thing you
guys<00:04:25.050> should<00:04:25.230> know<00:04:25.380> is<00:04:25.560> that<00:04:25.590> both<00:04:26.250> of<00:04:26.280> these

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
guys should know is that both of these

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.280 
guys should know is that both of these
scopes<00:04:26.790> are<00:04:26.970> countered<00:04:27.330> by<00:04:27.420> cold-blooded<00:04:28.050> so

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
scopes are countered by cold-blooded so

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.990 
scopes are countered by cold-blooded so
a<00:04:28.320> fake<00:04:28.710> enemy<00:04:29.130> has<00:04:29.310> cold-blooded<00:04:29.820> on<00:04:29.910> you

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
a fake enemy has cold-blooded on you

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.880 
a fake enemy has cold-blooded on you
won't<00:04:30.150> be<00:04:30.240> able<00:04:30.300> to<00:04:30.450> see<00:04:30.600> them<00:04:30.750> with<00:04:31.470> either<00:04:31.740> of

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
won't be able to see them with either of

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.170 
won't be able to see them with either of
these<00:04:32.100> scopes<00:04:32.250> so<00:04:32.490> now<00:04:32.640> I'll<00:04:32.760> get<00:04:32.880> into<00:04:33.030> the

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
these scopes so now I'll get into the

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.950 
these scopes so now I'll get into the
data<00:04:33.570> trials<00:04:34.080> that<00:04:34.170> I<00:04:34.230> did<00:04:34.520> and<00:04:35.570> it's<00:04:36.570> like<00:04:36.750> in

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
data trials that I did and it's like in

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.780 
data trials that I did and it's like in
a<00:04:37.050> lot<00:04:37.230> of<00:04:37.410> different<00:04:37.920> attachments<00:04:38.010> that<00:04:38.490> all

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
a lot of different attachments that all

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.130 
a lot of different attachments that all
the<00:04:38.880> attachments<00:04:39.390> affect<00:04:39.660> each<00:04:39.840> gun

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
the attachments affect each gun

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.950 
the attachments affect each gun
differently<00:04:40.680> and<00:04:41.360> like<00:04:42.360> basically<00:04:42.840> the

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
differently and like basically the

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.040 
differently and like basically the
target<00:04:43.500> finder<00:04:43.710> it<00:04:44.490> helps<00:04:45.000> out<00:04:45.150> the<00:04:45.300> LMGs<00:04:45.810> a

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
target finder it helps out the LMGs a

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.420 
target finder it helps out the LMGs a
little<00:04:46.320> bit<00:04:46.470> you<00:04:46.710> know<00:04:46.830> I<00:04:46.860> just<00:04:47.130> can<00:04:47.250> see<00:04:47.340> on

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
little bit you know I just can see on

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.210 
little bit you know I just can see on
the<00:04:47.490> screen<00:04:47.580> with<00:04:47.940> ranges<00:04:48.660> um<00:04:49.380> it's<00:04:49.770> like<00:04:49.920> the

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
the screen with ranges um it's like the

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.550 
the screen with ranges um it's like the
mms<00:04:50.700> site<00:04:50.910> really<00:04:51.180> helps<00:04:51.480> up<00:04:51.570> the<00:04:51.690> an-94<00:04:52.470> on

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
mms site really helps up the an-94 on

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.860 
mms site really helps up the an-94 on
the<00:04:52.620> MSMC<00:04:53.100> I've<00:04:53.580> used<00:04:53.820> him<00:04:53.970> on<00:04:54.060> both<00:04:54.360> I<00:04:54.510> really

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
the MSMC I've used him on both I really

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.050 
the MSMC I've used him on both I really
like<00:04:54.990> the<00:04:55.080> MSMC<00:04:55.470> it<00:04:55.770> helps<00:04:56.010> it<00:04:56.100> out<00:04:56.190> a<00:04:56.220> lot<00:04:56.520> it

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
like the MSMC it helps it out a lot it

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.180 
like the MSMC it helps it out a lot it
doesn't<00:04:57.360> give<00:04:57.690> the<00:04:57.840> MSMC<00:04:58.290> recoil<00:04:58.920> like<00:04:59.070> it

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
doesn't give the MSMC recoil like it

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.040 
doesn't give the MSMC recoil like it
does<00:04:59.310> on<00:04:59.400> some<00:04:59.730> guns<00:05:00.060> you<00:05:00.480> know<00:05:00.600> just<00:05:00.870> gotta

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
does on some guns you know just gotta

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.810 
does on some guns you know just gotta
kind<00:05:01.260> of<00:05:01.290> toy<00:05:01.500> around<00:05:01.650> with<00:05:01.950> it<00:05:02.100> but<00:05:02.130> I've<00:05:02.460> used

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
kind of toy around with it but I've used

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.420 
kind of toy around with it but I've used
it<00:05:03.000> on<00:05:03.120> the<00:05:03.570> MSMC<00:05:03.960> a<00:05:04.110> lot<00:05:04.320> I<00:05:04.350> actually<00:05:04.680> always

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
it on the MSMC a lot I actually always

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.880 
it on the MSMC a lot I actually always
use<00:05:05.580> it<00:05:05.730> on<00:05:05.850> the<00:05:06.120> MSMC<00:05:06.510> with<00:05:07.230> the<00:05:07.440> stock

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
use it on the MSMC with the stock

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.150 
use it on the MSMC with the stock
attachment<00:05:08.550> and<00:05:08.730> I<00:05:09.420> think<00:05:09.630> laser<00:05:09.840> sight<00:05:10.200> and<00:05:10.680> I

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
attachment and I think laser sight and I

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.120 
attachment and I think laser sight and I
always<00:05:11.430> use<00:05:11.580> that<00:05:11.900> and<00:05:12.900> you<00:05:13.020> know<00:05:13.110> at<00:05:13.260> the<00:05:13.350> m27

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
always use that and you know at the m27

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.510 
always use that and you know at the m27
as<00:05:14.870> you<00:05:15.870> can<00:05:15.990> see<00:05:16.140> it<00:05:16.350> has<00:05:16.500> awesome<00:05:16.710> accuracy

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
as you can see it has awesome accuracy

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.800 
as you can see it has awesome accuracy
you<00:05:17.670> really<00:05:17.940> you<00:05:18.030> can<00:05:18.180> use<00:05:18.300> either<00:05:18.540> one<00:05:18.780> of

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
you really you can use either one of

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.480 
you really you can use either one of
these<00:05:18.930> scopes<00:05:19.200> whatever<00:05:19.560> you<00:05:19.710> prefer<00:05:19.920> to<00:05:20.160> use

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
these scopes whatever you prefer to use

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.100 
these scopes whatever you prefer to use
and<00:05:20.940> I'm<00:05:21.180> like<00:05:21.300> really<00:05:21.330> what<00:05:21.690> I'm<00:05:21.780> coming<00:05:21.990> to

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
and I'm like really what I'm coming to

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.340 
and I'm like really what I'm coming to
with<00:05:22.350> this<00:05:22.500> is<00:05:22.680> that<00:05:22.920> the<00:05:23.610> MMS<00:05:24.090> in<00:05:24.390> the<00:05:24.660> target

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
with this is that the MMS in the target

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.080 
with this is that the MMS in the target
finder<00:05:25.560> they're<00:05:25.980> both<00:05:26.160> good<00:05:26.460> scopes<00:05:26.760> both

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
finder they're both good scopes both

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.180 
finder they're both good scopes both
like<00:05:27.330> I<00:05:27.450> said<00:05:27.630> different<00:05:28.020> in<00:05:28.470> what<00:05:28.950> they<00:05:29.010> do

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
like I said different in what they do

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.640 
like I said different in what they do
and<00:05:29.730> they're<00:05:30.510> both<00:05:30.630> specialized<00:05:31.140> optics<00:05:31.500> and

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
and they're both specialized optics and

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.800 
and they're both specialized optics and
really<00:05:32.040> they're<00:05:32.790> different<00:05:33.120> for<00:05:33.360> like<00:05:33.510> every

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
really they're different for like every

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.570 
really they're different for like every
gun<00:05:33.990> you<00:05:34.020> gotta<00:05:34.320> like<00:05:34.530> toy<00:05:34.770> around<00:05:34.950> and<00:05:35.340> see

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
gun you gotta like toy around and see

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.310 
gun you gotta like toy around and see
like<00:05:35.880> do<00:05:36.120> a<00:05:36.150> little<00:05:36.270> testing<00:05:36.750> by<00:05:36.900> yourself

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
like do a little testing by yourself

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.050 
like do a little testing by yourself
there's<00:05:37.500> not<00:05:37.620> really<00:05:37.830> one<00:05:38.160> gun<00:05:38.430> it<00:05:38.550> stands<00:05:38.850> out

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
there's not really one gun it stands out

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.360 
there's not really one gun it stands out
for<00:05:39.330> one<00:05:39.630> gun<00:05:39.840> it's<00:05:40.020> like<00:05:40.169> really<00:05:40.440> bad<00:05:40.710> they

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
for one gun it's like really bad they

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.490 
for one gun it's like really bad they
both<00:05:41.700> affected<00:05:42.390> each<00:05:42.570> guns<00:05:42.930> they're<00:05:43.320> each

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
both affected each guns they're each

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.460 
both affected each guns they're each
done<00:05:43.830> differently<00:05:44.370> and<00:05:44.490> you<00:05:45.120> know<00:05:45.410> you<00:05:46.410> just

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
done differently and you know you just

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.170 
done differently and you know you just
gotta<00:05:46.680> toy<00:05:46.919> around<00:05:47.070> I<00:05:47.310> mean<00:05:47.490> you<00:05:47.910> can<00:05:48.000> tell<00:05:48.060> you

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
gotta toy around I mean you can tell you

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.450 
gotta toy around I mean you can tell you
right<00:05:48.240> now<00:05:48.300> the<00:05:48.419> MMS<00:05:49.050> helps<00:05:49.500> off<00:05:49.590> the<00:05:49.710> an-94

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
right now the MMS helps off the an-94

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.480 
right now the MMS helps off the an-94
and<00:05:50.730> the<00:05:50.910> MSMC<00:05:51.360> a<00:05:51.540> lot<00:05:51.900> and<00:05:52.230> the<00:05:52.980> target<00:05:53.340> finder

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
and the MSMC a lot and the target finder

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.010 
and the MSMC a lot and the target finder
when<00:05:53.880> I<00:05:53.910> was<00:05:54.060> testing<00:05:54.480> does<00:05:54.600> how<00:05:54.750> about<00:05:54.900> the

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
when I was testing does how about the

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.710 
when I was testing does how about the
PDW<00:05:55.650> and<00:05:55.860> the<00:05:56.070> LMG<00:05:56.550> but<00:05:57.120> it<00:05:57.210> really<00:05:57.540> it<00:05:57.630> all

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 
PDW and the LMG but it really it all

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.130 
PDW and the LMG but it really it all
comes<00:05:57.960> down<00:05:58.050> to<00:05:58.230> personal<00:05:58.410> preference<00:05:58.980> and

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:00.140 
comes down to personal preference and

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.300 
comes down to personal preference and
you<00:06:01.140> know<00:06:01.230> that's<00:06:01.380> that<00:06:01.620> the<00:06:01.890> one<00:06:02.070> thing<00:06:02.250> that

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
you know that's that the one thing that

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.240 
you know that's that the one thing that
it<00:06:02.520> doesn't<00:06:02.820> help<00:06:02.940> which<00:06:03.600> I<00:06:04.220> really<00:06:05.220> I

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
it doesn't help which I really I

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.580 
it doesn't help which I really I
wouldn't<00:06:05.550> expect<00:06:05.760> it<00:06:05.970> to<00:06:06.060> help<00:06:06.210> is<00:06:06.330> the

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:06.590 
wouldn't expect it to help is the

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.530 
wouldn't expect it to help is the
shotguns<00:06:07.590> because<00:06:08.070> as<00:06:08.820> you<00:06:08.940> can<00:06:09.030> see<00:06:09.090> hmmm

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:09.540 
shotguns because as you can see hmmm

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.970 
shotguns because as you can see hmmm
that<00:06:09.570> sight<00:06:09.870> right<00:06:09.990> here<00:06:10.169> you<00:06:10.560> shoot<00:06:10.800> it<00:06:10.950> it

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:10.980 
that sight right here you shoot it it

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.710 
that sight right here you shoot it it
doesn't<00:06:11.310> change<00:06:11.760> the<00:06:11.970> spread<00:06:12.270> really<00:06:12.419> that

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 
doesn't change the spread really that

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.210 
doesn't change the spread really that
much<00:06:12.900> at<00:06:13.080> all<00:06:13.110> so<00:06:13.290> basically<00:06:13.890> if<00:06:14.010> you're<00:06:14.100> gonna

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 
much at all so basically if you're gonna

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.630 
much at all so basically if you're gonna
use<00:06:14.340> down<00:06:14.490> the<00:06:14.580> shotgun<00:06:14.910> the<00:06:15.270> mms<00:06:15.600> sight<00:06:15.840> arm

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:16.640 
use down the shotgun the mms sight arm

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.550 
use down the shotgun the mms sight arm
you're<00:06:17.640> just<00:06:18.000> going<00:06:18.390> to<00:06:18.870> see<00:06:19.080> through<00:06:19.290> walls

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 
you're just going to see through walls

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.780 
you're just going to see through walls
which<00:06:19.830> really<00:06:20.100> isn't<00:06:20.250> helpful<00:06:20.610> with<00:06:20.700> the

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:20.790 
which really isn't helpful with the

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:22.490 
which really isn't helpful with the
shotgun<00:06:21.090> unless<00:06:21.480> you<00:06:21.630> have<00:06:21.720> FMJ<00:06:22.230> which<00:06:22.410> you

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.500 
shotgun unless you have FMJ which you

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.590 
shotgun unless you have FMJ which you
can't<00:06:22.680> use<00:06:22.710> that<00:06:22.830> from<00:06:23.070> jane<00:06:23.280> and<00:06:23.520> then<00:06:24.450> that's

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:24.600 
can't use that from jane and then that's

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.330 
can't use that from jane and then that's
at<00:06:24.750> the<00:06:24.840> same<00:06:24.990> time<00:06:25.200> so<00:06:25.410> that's<00:06:25.530> that<00:06:25.770> so<00:06:26.040> I

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.340 
at the same time so that's that so I

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.430 
at the same time so that's that so I
told<00:06:26.850> you<00:06:27.000> what<00:06:27.150> you<00:06:27.330> site<00:06:27.630> does<00:06:27.870> the<00:06:28.050> pros<00:06:28.260> and

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
told you what you site does the pros and

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.290 
told you what you site does the pros and
cons<00:06:28.680> give<00:06:29.010> you<00:06:29.130> a<00:06:29.160> little<00:06:29.310> in<00:06:29.550> depth<00:06:29.850> of<00:06:30.120> it

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300 
cons give you a little in depth of it

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.240 
cons give you a little in depth of it
can<00:06:30.870> told<00:06:31.080> you<00:06:31.289> what<00:06:31.470> guns<00:06:31.740> are<00:06:31.890> kind<00:06:32.070> of<00:06:32.130> works

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.250 
can told you what guns are kind of works

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:32.540 
can told you what guns are kind of works
with

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550 
with

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.040 
with
but<00:06:32.670> really<00:06:33.030> overall<00:06:33.330> it<00:06:33.540> comes<00:06:33.750> on<00:06:33.900> to<00:06:34.020> a

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
but really overall it comes on to a

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.960 
but really overall it comes on to a
personal<00:06:34.440> preference<00:06:34.740> what<00:06:35.430> you<00:06:35.580> like<00:06:35.760> better

and you guys may have to experiment if

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.320 
and you guys may have to experiment if
you<00:06:38.070> want<00:06:38.250> to<00:06:38.310> see<00:06:38.400> which<00:06:38.610> is<00:06:38.640> better<00:06:39.030> for

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330 
you want to see which is better for

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.510 
you want to see which is better for
