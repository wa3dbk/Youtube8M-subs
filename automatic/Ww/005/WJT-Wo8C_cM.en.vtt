 our leadership was nervous and upstairs 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.560
 so that she gets paid in time 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.330

 Aviation turns bad today in 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.939
 Internet talks appeared 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.100
 dispatcher in technical services vnukovo and 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.600
 pilots crashed for the same business 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.670
 few minutes before the crash 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.170
 from the record is clear until the wreck 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.030
 falcona airport work in staff 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.250
 pre-crash driver mode 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.140
 snowthrower twice crossed the take-off 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.180
 lane all strictly according to the instructions from 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.890

 forty year old mentor give permission 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.740
 take off and make a fatal mistake 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.329
 taking into account incorrect data 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.399
 monitoring system 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.360
 and notice the snow blower on the strip they are not 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.670
 could physically 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.530
 due to fog visibility is less than 300 meters 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.479
 a few days after the disaster 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.729
 one of the employees laid out in 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.470
 network video confirming that radars are on 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.090
 which should be displayed ground 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.860
 appliances are not just blind 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.990
 they show cars which 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.149
 there is no business, we managed to find 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.340
 this dispatcher alexander alexander 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.960
 show exclusive record where like 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.160
 on the night of catastrophes and the car leaves 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.180
 on the runway 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:19.609
 but not displayed on the monitor now 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:22.609
 in the band look do stand here this 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:25.790
 tick yes this tick this technique on 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:27.769
 carriage to the cup so. can work and 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.079
 when he crossed it on the strip 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:31.639
 sorry yes and commenting on the page 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.379
 it was not visible that he was a film on the strip 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:35.420
 is this great that is i'm talking about 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:37.250
 the fact that technology is not visible staff 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.409
 dispatching service vnukovo told 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.480
 they regularly informed us about 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:43.129
 its electronics and such volatile 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.790
 Dutch because mistakes can knock off 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:46.099
 sense even 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.720
 there was no official dispatcher 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.060
 There are explanations here too. 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.739
 informal complaints people are afraid to write 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.480
 the approach is very simple you can not work 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.120
 quits why your colleagues work 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.219
 sit they claim they can't on 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.260
 him you can't work this all 

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:02.359
 straight led to the fact that they died now 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.040
 people who generally accepted that this is where the tower 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:05.780
 need to look for by the way the signature under 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.030
 scandalous order set until 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.040
 but very many dispatchers in the most 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.319
 different airports announced Italian 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.060
 strike is when company employees 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.010
 work strictly by the rules and 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.169
 instructions in another profession such 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.329
 demarche maybe no one would have noticed but in 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:21.109
 aviation where force majeure is possible because 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:23.180
 any little things 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:24.290
 unnecessarily meticulously from the dispatcher for sure 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.780
 will lead to interruptions 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.500
 if you schedule the dispatcher everywhere 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.500
 there will be questions 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:35.280
 play it safe in that situation or 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:38.480
 no but some can make decisions 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.970
 insurance games so to speak 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.980
 semi obtained information about possible 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.959
 there was a cache of problems how to apply 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.180
 recheck it can cause 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:50.170
 is defined 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.730
 nuts in the torture of admission so don't 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.379
 it is excluded that flight delays and 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.420
 landings are not on schedule Russian 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:57.159
 airports can become commonplace 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.569
 on the other hand the passengers on them 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:00.310
 the strike will be reflected first 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:02.489
 should feel more 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.510
 security by the way according to our information 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.730
 air traffic controllers are looking for any ways 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.379
 support arrested colleagues today 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.299
 they started collecting money and discard 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:12.459
 1000 rubles and all these funds will go 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:14.019
 to help employees become grandchildren 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.129
 main suspects in the case of 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.930
 falcon crash 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:19.709
