00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.810 

remember<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.260> strongest<00:01:04.650> Wi-Fi<00:01:05.159> signal<00:01:05.670> here

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.030 
remember the strongest Wi-Fi signal here
the<00:01:06.000> moment<00:01:06.300> unfortunately<00:01:06.680> that<00:01:07.680> is<00:01:07.830> because

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
the moment unfortunately that is because

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.500 
the moment unfortunately that is because
the<00:01:08.070> rooters<00:01:08.520> or<00:01:08.640> downstairs<00:01:09.180> there's

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
the rooters or downstairs there's

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.010 
the rooters or downstairs there's
connected<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> minute<00:01:11.600> but<00:01:12.600> i<00:01:12.690> would<00:01:12.750> say

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
connected to a minute but i would say

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:20.800 
connected to a minute but i would say
that<00:01:13.050> old<00:01:13.470> Jimmy<00:01:13.800> looks<00:01:14.100> pretty<00:01:14.479> slick<00:01:19.700> well

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
that old Jimmy looks pretty slick well

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.120 
that old Jimmy looks pretty slick well
there's<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.869> bit<00:01:22.050> of<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.229> delay<00:01:22.470> for<00:01:22.740> example

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
there's a bit of a delay for example

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:33.220 
there's a bit of a delay for example
there

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:54.010 

so<00:01:33.980> I<00:01:34.010> mean<00:01:34.250> it's<00:01:34.400> not<00:01:34.550> as<00:01:34.730> fast<00:01:36.070> as

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:03.590 

that's<00:01:55.020> not<00:01:55.230> bad<00:01:55.440> is<00:01:55.470> it

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.050 

and<00:02:04.200> obviously<00:02:04.470> yeah<00:02:05.010> because<00:02:05.340> there's<00:02:05.850> no

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
and obviously yeah because there's no

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.090 
and obviously yeah because there's no
hard<00:02:06.360> because<00:02:07.080> there<00:02:07.350> are<00:02:07.470> hard<00:02:07.650> burns<00:02:07.890> it

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
hard because there are hard burns it

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.070 
hard because there are hard burns it
doesn't<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:09.209> already<00:02:09.479> knows<00:02:09.660> not<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:09.990> put<00:02:12.080> the

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
doesn't it already knows not to put the

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:22.490 
doesn't it already knows not to put the
burdens<00:02:13.440> in<00:02:13.620> there<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:21.900> only<00:02:22.080> thing<00:02:22.260> how<00:02:22.440> do

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
burdens in there the only thing how do

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.090 
burdens in there the only thing how do
we<00:02:22.650> get<00:02:23.930> so<00:02:24.930> holding<00:02:25.410> down<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.860> home<00:02:25.890> button

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
we get so holding down the home button

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:32.720 
we get so holding down the home button
when<00:02:26.850> I'm<00:02:26.940> open<00:02:27.360> within<00:02:27.600> you<00:02:31.400> brings<00:02:32.400> up<00:02:32.610> the

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
when I'm open within you brings up the

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.750 
when I'm open within you brings up the
task<00:02:32.940> switcher

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:50.470 

which<00:02:38.390> seems<00:02:38.720> smooth<00:02:39.080> enough

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.270 

yeah<00:02:51.140> I<00:02:51.170> mean<00:02:51.230> it's<00:02:51.379> a<00:02:51.500> little<00:02:51.860> it's<00:02:52.159> a<00:02:52.250> little

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
yeah I mean it's a little it's a little

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.509 
yeah I mean it's a little it's a little
jerky<00:02:52.940> obviously<00:02:53.360> but<00:02:53.569> it<00:02:54.010> is<00:02:55.010> only<00:02:55.250> a<00:02:55.340> single

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
jerky obviously but it is only a single

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:56.979 
jerky obviously but it is only a single
core<00:02:55.819> I<00:02:55.970> do<00:02:56.030> I<00:02:56.180> thought<00:02:56.569> they'd<00:02:56.720> said<00:02:56.900> they

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
core I do I thought they'd said they

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.360 
core I do I thought they'd said they
would<00:02:57.110> only<00:02:57.260> do<00:02:57.470> it<00:02:57.500> for<00:02:57.560> dual<00:02:57.769> coil<00:02:58.040> so<00:02:58.250> they

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
would only do it for dual coil so they

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.410 
would only do it for dual coil so they
have<00:02:58.519> can<00:02:58.700> I<00:02:58.730> hadn't<00:02:59.000> done<00:02:59.060> it<00:02:59.120> for<00:02:59.269> the<00:02:59.299> next

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
have can I hadn't done it for the next

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:08.440 
have can I hadn't done it for the next
as<00:02:59.659> though<00:03:05.950> it's<00:03:06.950> a<00:03:07.129> system<00:03:07.580> settings<00:03:08.030> all<00:03:08.299> the
