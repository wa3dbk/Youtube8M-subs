00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 with you again reality check as ours 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.390
 brain 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.330
 distinguishes true reality from 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.849
 virtual reality let's take for example 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.860
 about with the rails only this one is new 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.540
 gadget gave new life 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.690
 this aspect of video games 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.490
 but when we put it on my head like 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.490
 it is she who affects our brain 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.739
 near funds creates the illusion of finding 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.239
 in the virtual world thanks to filling 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.190
 image of the entire field of view of the player 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.800
 equipment used for this 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.690
 surprisingly simple instead 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.770
 consist of two separate displays by 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.660
 one for each eye 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.059
 near the view includes two lenses 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.770
 opposite one display in 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.600
 As a result, the player sees two images. 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.390
 slightly shifted each other 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.760
 friend horizontally this creates an illusion 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.160
 image depths using the same 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.739
 effect is created stereoscopic 3d 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.320
 however, the display is just one of 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.330
 iron oculus rift components 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.130
 also includes many sensors 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.990
 to track the location in 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.149
 space among which is a gyroscope 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.310
 accelerometer and magnetometer each one 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.740
 perfectly tracks head position with 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.300
 almost insignificant delay okay that's it 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.550
 hardware component but as far as 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.710
 strong effect when we are wearing this 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.880
 a piece as far as our brain is convinced 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.840
 that we are in virtual 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.840
 reality 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.579
 ultimately it comes down to the fact that 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.710
 oculus rift or any other device 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.740
 virtual reality creates effect 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.020
 called presence effect this 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.289
 subjective feeling of being together 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.330
 seeming real and so now 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:49.460
 ponder this we need to sort out 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.689
 how our brain interprets 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.329
 surroundings and subjects in our present 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.549
 reality is actually our perception 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.020
 the world is just the best guess 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.950
 our brain about what the hell 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.409
 happens 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.549
 based on previous experience 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.100
 information received by the senses 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.950
 that's why our brain is actually 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.319
 cheat pretty simple psychologist richard 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.480
 weissman constantly shoots video and starts up 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.280
 to a blog on this topic often using for 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.709
 of this optical illusions and tricks 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.760
 demonstrating that some how easily our brains 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.760
 served to deception 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.239
 but our brain never stops 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.400
 celebrate the present moment actually 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.470
 in scientific circles increasingly believe that 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.470
 the brain is an extremely complex machine 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.000
 predictions and so based on 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.000
 information from the senses and 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.980
 previous experience our brain constantly 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.170
 predicts future events and what 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.459
 more these predictions come true those 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.510
 stronger we feel 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.700
 presence effect happiness for us and for 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.769
 oculus rift and our brain lack 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.040
 video for feeling at least some 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.720
 presence effect it's great shown 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.239
 with some really some help 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.829
 good scientific experiments relying 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.569
 only on the video participants 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.880
 experiment reacted in virtual 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.370
 reality is surprisingly realistic 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.139
 for example they reacted to smiling 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.930
 avatars smiling back at them 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:15.319
 or actually take a step back when 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.180
 another avatar came too close 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.130
 what a moron 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.380
 in addition, those participants that were in 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.319
 costumes broadcasting real movements 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.280
 virtual real 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.829
 tried to remove their limbs 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.810
 virtual reality from objects 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:35.730
 who in real life hurt 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.409
 all this indicates that our brain 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.680
 surprisingly quickly begins to count 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:42.840
 a virtual body with his apparently 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.590
 the brain sees no boundaries between the real and 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.540
 virtual bodies real body and 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:55.109
 virtual become one for him 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:57.239
 whole and to demonstrate again 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.959
 power of the virtual reality helmet 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.370
 rift 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.829
 these aspects were used 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.730
 numerous attempts at treatment 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:08.569
 different types of psychosis 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.129
 the most interesting attraction phantom pains 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.230
 it felt in my experience 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:15.060
 a huge number of mutants who 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.739
 experienced discomfort in 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.989
 amputated limbs they 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.019
 ranged from twitching and trial to 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.820
 burning and pain not long immersion of such 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.620
 people are virtual reality where are they 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.660
 could see a virtual version of their 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.260
 amputated limbs and move her 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:33.150
 showed promising results 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.190
 so even though this is all pretty impressive 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.139
 there is one major obstacle to 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.260
 ways to create virtual reality in 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.880
 which you can dive completely 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.010
 although at the moment the video is good 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.110
 some degree is not enough for 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.930
 to convince our brain that we 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.240
 actually are in virtual 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.889
 reality tests on rats showed 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.440
 the importance of spatial brainwave 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.389
 cells are neurons that play 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.820
 key to creating cognitive 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:02.280
 maps and environments of these cells 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.930
 decreased by more than half when 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.240
 rats were placed in virtual reality 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.610
 compared to real activity 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.169
 the world, it shows that although the vision and 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.240
 spontaneous movement a little 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:14.220
 stimulates spatial activity 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.050
 brain cells in order to force 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.580
 rat or human fully feel 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.159
 your presence elsewhere 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.500
 a balance of information is needed from others 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:24.599
 sense organs and so that means that 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.970
 we need all the plethora of information from 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:30.680
 sense organs and stimuli to 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.680
 create a good cognitive map 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.350
 so what do you think about it can we 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.120
 ever fully immerse yourself in 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.830
 virtual reality or for that 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.050
 need too much touch 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.380
 information or do you think that oculus 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.510
 or 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.160
 and so good enough or just like u 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.560
 me your brain just hurts this 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.450
 Information write what you think on 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:03.350
 about this in the comments under the video 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:06.020
 see you in the next issue translated 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.850
 and voiced by the command x delay put
