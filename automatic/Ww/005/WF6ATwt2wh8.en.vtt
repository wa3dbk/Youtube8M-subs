you see my thought process in action

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.500 
you see my thought process in action
very<00:02:22.380> well<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.710> thing<00:02:23.890> is<00:02:24.070> if<00:02:24.310> you<00:02:24.430> if<00:02:25.210> you<00:02:25.390> go

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
very well the thing is if you if you go

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.000 
very well the thing is if you if you go
big<00:02:25.750> you<00:02:26.260> have<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:26.440> make<00:02:26.740> sure<00:02:26.770> you<00:02:26.920> have

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
big you have to make sure you have

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.960 
big you have to make sure you have
enough<00:02:27.160> alcohol<00:02:28.060> which<00:02:28.510> works<00:02:28.800> right<00:02:29.970> once

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
enough alcohol which works right once

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.740 
enough alcohol which works right once
yeah<00:02:32.340> but<00:02:33.340> if<00:02:33.610> you're<00:02:33.970> doing<00:02:34.210> a<00:02:34.270> drink<00:02:34.540> we<00:02:34.630> have

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:35.970 
yeah but if you're doing a drink we have
to<00:02:34.840> top<00:02:35.050> it<00:02:35.230> it's<00:02:35.350> harder<00:02:35.680> to<00:02:35.770> get<00:02:35.920> the

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
to top it it's harder to get the

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.740 
to top it it's harder to get the
proportions<00:02:36.730> right<00:02:36.790> but<00:02:37.060> since<00:02:37.180> this<00:02:37.330> one<00:02:37.540> I

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
proportions right but since this one I

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.600 
proportions right but since this one I
can't<00:02:38.290> pour<00:02:38.410> just<00:02:38.590> some<00:02:39.100> of<00:02:39.220> it<00:02:39.310> into<00:02:39.460> the

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
can't pour just some of it into the

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.850 
can't pour just some of it into the
glass<00:02:40.020> it's<00:02:41.020> not<00:02:41.200> too<00:02:41.320> bad

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
sticking site slightly sour on the

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.279 
sticking site slightly sour on the
strength<00:05:54.760> because<00:05:55.030> the<00:05:55.210> vodka<00:05:55.630> plays<00:05:55.840> in<00:05:56.080> here

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:56.289 
strength because the vodka plays in here

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:58.710 
strength because the vodka plays in here
and<00:05:56.520> while<00:05:57.520> the<00:05:57.669> vodkas<00:05:58.030> good<00:05:58.240> there<00:05:58.419> is<00:05:58.539> that

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
underlying vodka in the finish you know

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.180 
underlying vodka in the finish you know
I<00:06:01.510> think<00:06:01.840> most<00:06:02.229> people<00:06:02.380> will<00:06:02.620> know<00:06:02.770> this<00:06:03.010> is<00:06:03.160> a

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.190 
I think most people will know this is a

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.460 
I think most people will know this is a
vodka<00:06:03.729> drink<00:06:03.760> just<00:06:04.180> from<00:06:04.389> the<00:06:04.479> taste<00:06:04.660> it's<00:06:05.260> got

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
vodka drink just from the taste it's got

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:09.090 
vodka drink just from the taste it's got
that<00:06:05.650> like<00:06:05.889> ethanol<00:06:06.310> kick<00:06:06.700> at<00:06:06.850> the<00:06:06.970> end<00:06:08.100> and

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.100 
that like ethanol kick at the end and

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.279 
that like ethanol kick at the end and
with<00:06:09.639> that<00:06:09.789> sour<00:06:10.090> for<00:06:10.510> me<00:06:10.690> at<00:06:10.840> least<00:06:11.050> I

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:11.289 
with that sour for me at least I

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:13.050 
with that sour for me at least I
typically<00:06:11.710> can<00:06:11.950> get<00:06:12.220> a<00:06:12.250> little<00:06:12.460> more<00:06:12.640> alcohol

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060 
typically can get a little more alcohol

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.060 
typically can get a little more alcohol
out<00:06:13.270> of<00:06:13.390> the<00:06:13.479> drink<00:06:13.750> the<00:06:14.470> flavor<00:06:14.770> of<00:06:14.919> that

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.070 
out of the drink the flavor of that

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.749 
out of the drink the flavor of that
alcohol

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:15.759 
alcohol

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:18.269 
alcohol
when<00:06:16.270> it's<00:06:16.449> ours<00:06:16.839> opposes<00:06:17.229> sweet<00:06:17.469> I<00:06:17.770> think

00:06:18.269 --> 00:06:18.279 
when it's ours opposes sweet I think

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:21.200 
when it's ours opposes sweet I think
that's<00:06:18.550> probably<00:06:18.699> common<00:06:19.210> but<00:06:19.589> if<00:06:20.589> it's<00:06:20.800> not

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210 
that's probably common but if it's not

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:22.589 
that's probably common but if it's not
just<00:06:22.210> me

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:22.599 
just me

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:25.999 
just me
but<00:06:23.080> so<00:06:23.439> you<00:06:23.529> get<00:06:23.650> a<00:06:23.680> slightly<00:06:24.039> sour<00:06:24.719> citrus

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:26.009 
but so you get a slightly sour citrus

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:30.659 
but so you get a slightly sour citrus
dry<00:06:27.009> citrus<00:06:27.639> lemon<00:06:28.360> play<00:06:28.830> ending<00:06:29.830> with<00:06:30.039> the

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:30.669 
dry citrus lemon play ending with the

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:34.249 
dry citrus lemon play ending with the
vodka<00:06:30.849> let<00:06:31.539> me<00:06:31.599> try<00:06:31.719> again

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:34.259 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:37.230

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.240 
yeah in some orange in there the orange

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.360 
yeah in some orange in there the orange
is<00:06:37.360> actually<00:06:38.139> kind<00:06:38.349> of<00:06:38.439> desirable<00:06:39.159> on<00:06:39.249> this

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:39.370 
is actually kind of desirable on this
