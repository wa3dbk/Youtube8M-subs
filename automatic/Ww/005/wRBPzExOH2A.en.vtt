00:00:00.267 --> 00:00:03.667
 Let's get some experience in understanding the variables 

00:00:03.667 --> 00:00:07.066
 and the negative numbers they can represent, 

00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:08.766
 or positive numbers. 

00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:10.500
 We are told to arrange the following expressions 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.566
 according to their value from the smallest to the largest. 

00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:14.200
 And we are given these three expressions - 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.267
 q minus n, n and n minus q, 

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:19.534
 and n and q are then applied to the numerical axis. 

00:00:19.534 --> 00:00:20.467
 In order to get better, 

00:00:20.467 --> 00:00:23.100
 let's see three divisions to the left of 0 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.900
 are minus 3. 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.900
 For each division, we must move to a lower value to the left by 1. 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.733
 This must be minus 1, minus 2, 

00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:31.066
 and this is minus 3. 

00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:32.600
 Then, as we move to the right, 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.366
 each division should increase by 1. 

00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:37.867
 We have 0, 1, 2 and then 3. 

00:00:37.867 --> 00:00:39.933
 And then it just helps us to get a little better. 

00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:42.633
 But let's just look at each of these expressions. 

00:00:42.633 --> 00:00:44.967
 The first is q minus n. 

00:00:44.967 --> 00:00:47.433
 A q is to the right of n on the numerical axis. 

00:00:47.433 --> 00:00:51.300
 We know that q is greater than n. 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.367
 So if q is greater than n and subtract n from q, 

00:00:54.367 --> 00:00:56.629
 it does not really matter if both are negative 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.900
 or positive, or one is negative and the other positive. 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.833
 Simply the fact that we know q is greater than n 

00:01:03.833 --> 00:01:08.033
 means that q minus n will be positive. 

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:09.873
 And if we actually mean that 

00:01:09.873 --> 00:01:14.366
 a specific case, q is positive, and n is negative. 

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:16.233
 If you take a negative, 

00:01:16.233 --> 00:01:19.433
 in essence, you will add positively. 

00:01:19.433 --> 00:01:21.266
 So the value here 

00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:22.866
 not only will it be positive, 

00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:26.433
 but will be a positive value greater than q. 

00:01:26.433 --> 00:01:27.800
 And if we have to compare it with q, 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.400
 we will know that it is larger than q, 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.233
 but we do not want this. 

00:01:31.233 --> 00:01:33.033
 Now we have n. 

00:01:33.033 --> 00:01:36.800
 n is a negative value. 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.867
 It is a negative number. 

00:01:37.867 --> 00:01:39.433
 And it is a negative number between minus 1 

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:40.233
 and minus 2. 

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:44.600
 It seems to be approximately minus 1.8. 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.700
 We do not know for sure, but if we just look at it, 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.300
 this thing is minus and looks like 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.066
 approximately minus 1.8. 

00:01:53.066 --> 00:01:55.233
 But how much is n minus q? 

00:01:55.233 --> 00:01:57.466
 n minus q? 

00:01:57.466 --> 00:02:01.400
 It will be the negative of q minus n. 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.067
 n minus q, we have the smaller number 

00:02:04.067 --> 00:02:08.400
 and we extract the larger number from it. 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.800
 Then this thing here will be negative. 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.769
 Therefore, the largest of these values ​​will definitely be 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.900
 q minus n, which will be positive. 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.766
 And then we have to find out which one will be smaller. 

00:02:18.766 --> 00:02:23.300
 This value n or this value n minus q? 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.766
 Let's think a little. 

00:02:24.766 --> 00:02:27.576
 We can simply try to determine roughly how much q is. 

00:02:27.576 --> 00:02:30.281
 And if we look at it, q seems to be approximate 

00:02:30.281 --> 00:02:34.577
 about 0.8, and it looks like 

00:02:34.592 --> 00:02:38.700
 approximately, I already said, minus 1.8. 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.400
 So if we accept these assumptions here, 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.633
 this thing will be 

00:02:41.633 --> 00:02:46.366
 approximately minus 1.8 

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:50.633
 minus 0.8, which is 

00:02:50.633 --> 00:02:54.100
 equal to minus 2.6. 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.733
 When we look at it in this way, you clearly see that 

00:02:55.733 --> 00:02:59.000
 it will be less than here. 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.698
 So this is the smallest, 

00:03:02.698 --> 00:03:06.933
 and this is the biggest value. 

00:03:06.933 --> 00:03:11.900
 Sometimes when people say 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.634
 small and large, they mean absolute value. 

00:03:14.634 --> 00:03:16.400
 But let's say it's the smallest one 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.667
 this greatest value. 

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:21.966
 If we want to arrange them, 

00:03:21.966 --> 00:03:26.266
 we will start from n minus q and then, 

00:03:26.266 --> 00:03:28.000
 if you decide this in the Cannes academy, 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.700
 you will have to click on these buttons and move them, 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.366
 but if we can not, we will have n minus q, 

00:03:33.366 --> 00:03:35.134
 which is the smallest. 

00:03:35.134 --> 00:03:37.933
 Then we have n, which is also negative, but not so small. 

00:03:37.933 --> 00:03:41.700
 This is approximately minus 1.8, this is approximately minus 2.6. 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.933
 And then q minus n, which will be 

00:03:45.933 --> 00:03:49.067
 approximately plus 2.6. 

00:03:49.067 --> 00:03:53.000
 So this is the biggest value. 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.641
 Let's solve the next task. 

00:03:57.933 --> 00:04:02.200
 Sort the following expressions 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.100
 according to their values ​​from the smallest to the largest. 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.467
 Similarly here 

00:04:07.467 --> 00:04:09.066
 each division seems to be 1/2, 

00:04:09.066 --> 00:04:10.300
 because we need two divisions to get to 1. 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.766
 That's 1/2. 

00:04:11.766 --> 00:04:15.100
 Here it is minus 1/2. 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.288
 We want to compare a minus b, 

00:04:18.288 --> 00:04:21.876
 and a minus 0.5. 

00:04:21.876 --> 00:04:23.466
 They all have a, 

00:04:23.466 --> 00:04:27.013
 you can even consider this as a minus 0. 

00:04:27.013 --> 00:04:28.931
 It's the same as a. 

00:04:28.931 --> 00:04:29.855
 Let's see now. 

00:04:29.855 --> 00:04:32.300
 In all of them we have and extract something from it. 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.333
 Here we draw 0. 

00:04:34.333 --> 00:04:35.700
 I guess we're getting nothing. 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.100
 Here you get b. 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.966
 And here you get 0.5. 

00:04:39.966 --> 00:04:42.205
 In general, the more you subtract, 

00:04:42.205 --> 00:04:45.752
 the higher the value you make, 

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:48.233
 the less you get. 

00:04:48.233 --> 00:04:49.266
 Let's see. 

00:04:49.266 --> 00:04:52.200
 In which of these cases do I draw the most? 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.966
 Here I draw a positive integer. 

00:04:54.966 --> 00:04:57.033
 Here I get 0. 

00:04:57.033 --> 00:05:01.467
 Here I subtract b, which is a negative number. 

00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:03.567
 Here I draw a negative number. 

00:05:03.567 --> 00:05:06.266
 b is negative. 

00:05:06.266 --> 00:05:08.400
 It is clear that this is positive. 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.900
 So if you subtract a positive integer from a, 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.233
 you will get less value, 

00:05:14.233 --> 00:05:15.566
 than if you get a negative number. 

00:05:15.566 --> 00:05:17.166
 In fact, if you subtract a negative number, 

00:05:17.166 --> 00:05:18.533
 you will add it to a. 

00:05:18.533 --> 00:05:20.500
 You will get a number greater than a. 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.500
 So the smallest value is the one you take out 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.500
 the largest value. 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.900
 That is, minus 0.5. 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.433
 We get a positive integer. 

00:05:30.433 --> 00:05:32.200
 We subtract 0.5. 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.800
 Next to a, where we do not pull out anything. 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.667
 Finally, we have a minus b. 

00:05:37.667 --> 00:05:39.433
 This will be the biggest value here. 

00:05:39.433 --> 00:05:40.400
 Why is that? 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.300
 Well we know b is a negative number. 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.033
 Note that it is below 0 here, so 

00:05:45.033 --> 00:05:48.667
 if b is a negative number, if you subtract a negative number, 

00:05:48.667 --> 00:05:50.066
 you will actually get a value that is 

00:05:50.066 --> 00:05:51.133
 greater than a. 

00:05:51.133 --> 00:05:52.133
 Let me make it clear. 

00:05:52.133 --> 00:05:55.533
 This value here will be less than a. 

00:05:55.533 --> 00:05:57.601
 This value here is clear that it is equal to α. 

00:05:57.601 --> 00:05:59.400
 And this value here is actually going to be 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.866
 greater than a. 

00:06:00.866 --> 00:06:02.700
 So now we have them sorted from the smallest to the largest. 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.567
 And if we solve it in the exercises of Canadian Academy, 

00:06:04.567 --> 00:06:06.567
 we will have a small tool with which we will be able to snap 

00:06:06.567 --> 00:06:07.900
 and move them. 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.033
 But this is the smallest value followed by that followed by this. 

00:06:12.033 --> 00:06:13.333
 Another way you can use, 

00:06:13.333 --> 00:06:14.633
 is the same we applied in the latter example. 

00:06:14.633 --> 00:06:18.133
 You can try to estimate how many these values ​​are. 

00:06:18.133 --> 00:06:20.667
 b looks like, I do not know is not an exact number, 

00:06:20.667 --> 00:06:23.845
 looks about minus 0.2, 

00:06:23.845 --> 00:06:27.166
 it is approximately minus 0.2. 

00:06:27.166 --> 00:06:28.967
 Do not forget that it's minus 1/2. 

00:06:28.967 --> 00:06:30.809
 This is minus 0.5. 

00:06:30.809 --> 00:06:34.200
 but it looks like it's about, I do not know, 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.953
 minus 0.7. 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.767
 So you can actually do it 

00:06:40.767 --> 00:06:45.100
 with actual values ​​if you want, 

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:49.089
 but you will get the same result.
