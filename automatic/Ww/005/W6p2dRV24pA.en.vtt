how do you feel I'm feeling well

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.400 
how do you feel I'm feeling well
normally<00:00:05.400> at<00:00:06.120> this<00:00:06.150> time<00:00:06.540> he<00:00:06.990> was<00:00:07.140> a<00:00:07.170> little

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
normally at this time he was a little

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.430 
normally at this time he was a little
bit<00:00:07.500> spooky<00:00:07.859> at<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.099> beginning<00:00:08.519> I<00:00:08.670> think<00:00:09.570> this

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
bit spooky at the beginning I think this

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.190 
bit spooky at the beginning I think this
place<00:00:10.800> for<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.250> warming<00:00:11.580> up<00:00:11.700> is<00:00:11.880> not<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:13.049> best

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
place for the warming up is not the best

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.730 
place for the warming up is not the best
part<00:00:13.530> it's<00:00:14.519> too<00:00:14.820> close<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.440> the<00:00:16.440> horses

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
part it's too close and the horses

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.980 
part it's too close and the horses
cannot<00:00:17.160> contra<00:00:17.640> forward<00:00:18.090> enough<00:00:18.359> before<00:00:18.750> we

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
cannot contra forward enough before we

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.080 
cannot contra forward enough before we
start<00:00:19.230> in<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.380> cross<00:00:19.619> country<00:00:19.800> so<00:00:20.670> then<00:00:20.939> he

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
start in the cross country so then he

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.300 
start in the cross country so then he
say<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.570> little<00:00:21.840> bit<00:00:22.020> tied<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:23.810> yeah<00:00:24.949> so<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:25.980> ones

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
say a little bit tied and yeah so I ones

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.730 
say a little bit tied and yeah so I ones
egg<00:00:26.490> on<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.880> fences<00:00:27.359> he<00:00:27.570> was<00:00:27.720> really<00:00:28.230> good<00:00:28.410> he

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
egg on the fences he was really good he

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.640 
egg on the fences he was really good he
jumps<00:00:29.429> well<00:00:29.640> he<00:00:29.880> jumps<00:00:30.150> high<00:00:30.269> enough<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.779> that

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
jumps well he jumps high enough and that

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.650 
jumps well he jumps high enough and that
works<00:00:31.949> but<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.850> canter<00:00:33.210> between<00:00:33.510> the

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
works but in the canter between the

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.450 
works but in the canter between the
fences<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.530> could<00:00:34.770> be<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:34.920> little<00:00:35.190> bit<00:00:35.370> more

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
fences it could be a little bit more

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.930 
fences it could be a little bit more
relaxed<00:00:39.140> the<00:00:40.140> most<00:00:40.350> difficult<00:00:40.469> waters<00:00:41.129> the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
relaxed the most difficult waters the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.580 
relaxed the most difficult waters the
first<00:00:42.210> water<00:00:42.450> we<00:00:42.690> saw<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:42.930> in<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.140> CC<00:00:43.469> is

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
first water we saw it in the CC is

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.830 
first water we saw it in the CC is
restarted<00:00:44.370> was<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.059> most<00:00:45.239> difficult<00:00:45.360> drum

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
restarted was the most difficult drum

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.950 
restarted was the most difficult drum
and<00:00:46.370> so<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.399> changed<00:00:47.910> my<00:00:48.149> plan<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.629> i<00:00:48.719> want<00:00:48.899> to

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
and so I changed my plan and i want to

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.529 
and so I changed my plan and i want to
write<00:00:49.200> in<00:00:49.350> five<00:00:49.530> strides<00:00:49.890> not<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.219> far<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.700> it

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
write in five strides not in far and it

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.790 
write in five strides not in far and it
was<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.989> good<00:00:52.199> decision<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:53.160> other<00:00:53.789> part<00:00:54.800> was

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
was a good decision the other part was

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.279 
was a good decision the other part was
exactly<00:00:56.280> three<00:00:56.579> on<00:00:56.760> forward<00:00:57.300> he<00:00:57.660> made<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.050> but

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
exactly three on forward he made it but

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.920 
exactly three on forward he made it but
it<00:00:58.410> was<00:00:58.530> really<00:00:58.829> long<00:00:59.059> long<00:01:00.059> distance<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:00.750> he

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
it was really long long distance so he

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.799 
it was really long long distance so he
had<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.350> little<00:01:01.590> bit<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.829> fight<00:01:02.480> but<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.600> works

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
had a little bit to fight but it works

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.380 
had a little bit to fight but it works
and<00:01:05.180> something<00:01:06.180> about<00:01:06.680> problems<00:01:07.820> yeah<00:01:08.820> pilot

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
and something about problems yeah pilot

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.359 
and something about problems yeah pilot
had<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.540> really<00:01:09.930> bad<00:01:10.170> luck<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:11.130> day

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
had a really bad luck to this this day

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.179 
had a really bad luck to this this day
it's<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.850> really<00:01:12.090> difficult<00:01:12.330> horse<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:13.189> our

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
it's a really difficult horse and our

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.240 
it's a really difficult horse and our
plan<00:01:14.640> was<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.939> let<00:01:15.330> him<00:01:15.509> run<00:01:15.750> at<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.049> first

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
plan was to let him run at the first

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.219 
plan was to let him run at the first
fences<00:01:17.250> until<00:01:18.180> two<00:01:18.390> or<00:01:18.420> three<00:01:18.750> minutes<00:01:18.900> and

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
fences until two or three minutes and

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.810 
fences until two or three minutes and
then<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.820> horse<00:01:21.590> is<00:01:22.590> starting<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.670> be

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
then the horse is starting to to be

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.880 
then the horse is starting to to be
careful<00:01:24.270> when<00:01:24.420> he<00:01:24.540> start<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:25.020> fight<00:01:25.470> with<00:01:25.680> him

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
careful when he start to fight with him

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.730 
careful when he start to fight with him
then<00:01:26.610> he<00:01:27.390> has<00:01:27.509> not<00:01:27.689> enough<00:01:27.930> power<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.290> bring<00:01:28.590> it

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
then he has not enough power to bring it

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.980 
then he has not enough power to bring it
in<00:01:28.890> there<00:01:29.070> until<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.729> end<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.720> plan<00:01:30.960> was

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
in there until the end so the plan was

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.649 
in there until the end so the plan was
good<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:32.340> house<00:01:32.579> started<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.240> come<00:01:33.450> back

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
good and the house started to come back

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.899 
good and the house started to come back
after<00:01:33.930> fence<00:01:34.920> number<00:01:35.250> eight<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.460> nine<00:01:35.880> and

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
after fence number eight and nine and

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.149 
after fence number eight and nine and
ten<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.509> was<00:01:36.630> perfect<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.170> then<00:01:37.650> he<00:01:37.770> made<00:01:38.130> a

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
ten it was perfect and then he made a

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.700 
ten it was perfect and then he made a
little<00:01:38.369> mistake<00:01:38.670> for<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.450> corner<00:01:39.869> he<00:01:40.439> start

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
little mistake for the corner he start

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.789 
little mistake for the corner he start
to<00:01:40.829> fight<00:01:41.040> only<00:01:41.220> with<00:01:41.930> with<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.020> rain<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.409> not

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
to fight only with with the rain and not

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.350 
to fight only with with the rain and not
to<00:01:44.040> bring<00:01:44.189> him<00:01:44.310> together<00:01:44.460> with<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.939> seed<00:01:45.149> that

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
to bring him together with the seed that

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.569 
to bring him together with the seed that
was<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.720> first<00:01:45.960> thing<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:47.040> other<00:01:47.159> fault

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
was the first thing and the other fault

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.120 
was the first thing and the other fault
was<00:01:47.820> in<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.810> distance<00:01:49.380> what<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.560> told<00:01:49.680> I

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130

make<00:02:04.829> it<00:02:04.920> this<00:02:05.040> big<00:02:05.250> mistake<00:02:05.850> at<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.329> end

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
make it this big mistake at the end

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.750 
make it this big mistake at the end
I<00:02:11.140> didn't<00:02:12.140> told<00:02:12.320> him<00:02:12.590> but<00:02:12.740> it<00:02:12.860> was<00:02:12.890> an<00:02:13.220> absolute

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
I didn't told him but it was an absolute

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.670 
I didn't told him but it was an absolute
right<00:02:13.940> decision<00:02:14.450> but<00:02:14.570> it<00:02:14.720> makes<00:02:14.900> no<00:02:15.080> sense<00:02:15.110> to

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
right decision but it makes no sense to

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.270 
right decision but it makes no sense to
write<00:02:15.980> of<00:02:16.390> 3<00:02:17.390> star<00:02:17.630> level<00:02:17.960> cause<00:02:18.170> without<00:02:19.040> any

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
write of 3 star level cause without any

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.720 
write of 3 star level cause without any
result<00:02:19.730> and<00:02:19.940> after<00:02:20.540> his<00:02:20.690> second<00:02:21.530> refuser<00:02:22.460> he

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
result and after his second refuser he

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.320 
result and after his second refuser he
had<00:02:22.850> no<00:02:23.060> qualifying<00:02:23.720> and<00:02:24.730> so<00:02:25.730> it<00:02:25.880> makes<00:02:26.060> no

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
had no qualifying and so it makes no

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.120 
had no qualifying and so it makes no
sense<00:02:26.360> and<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:26.960> ground<00:02:27.170> is<00:02:27.290> not<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.590> best<00:02:27.740> so

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
sense and the ground is not the best so

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.670 
sense and the ground is not the best so
he<00:02:28.940> retired<00:02:29.330> and<00:02:29.540> is<00:02:29.630> that<00:02:29.780> what<00:02:29.930> Absolut's

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
he retired and is that what Absolut's

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.790 
he retired and is that what Absolut's
the<00:02:31.010> best<00:02:31.220> decision<00:02:31.580> what<00:02:31.730> he<00:02:31.820> made<00:02:35.650> at<00:02:36.650> the

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
the best decision what he made at the

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.340 
the best decision what he made at the
moment<00:02:37.220> he<00:02:37.370> has<00:02:37.550> to<00:02:37.820> wait<00:02:38.660> a<00:02:38.720> little<00:02:38.959> bit<00:02:39.170> and

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
moment he has to wait a little bit and

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.550 
moment he has to wait a little bit and
think<00:02:39.560> about<00:02:40.070> his<00:02:40.250> mistakes<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:41.260> he<00:02:42.260> has<00:02:42.380> no

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
think about his mistakes and he has no

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.530 
think about his mistakes and he has no
chance<00:02:42.770> to<00:02:43.070> make<00:02:43.430> it<00:02:43.459> qualifying<00:02:44.209> for<00:02:44.480> the

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
chance to make it qualifying for the
