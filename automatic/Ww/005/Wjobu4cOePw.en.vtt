00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
really cool but what we take away from

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.710 
really cool but what we take away from
this<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.619> there's<00:01:34.950> no<00:01:35.159> specific<00:01:35.549> release<00:01:36.479> date

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720

there's<00:01:36.900> no<00:01:37.020> point<00:01:37.259> speculating<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.369> think

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
there's no point speculating I think

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.760 
there's no point speculating I think

which shows some of the updates I mean
look<00:02:09.810> at<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.050> background<00:02:10.500> this<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.830> new<00:02:11.009> biome

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
look at the background this a new biome

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.800 
look at the background this a new biome
it<00:02:11.580> looks<00:02:11.730> like<00:02:12.060> mountain

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
it looks like mountain

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.510 
it looks like mountain
is<00:02:13.050> it<00:02:13.200> like<00:02:13.319> a<00:02:13.349> high-altitude<00:02:13.739> I<00:02:14.220> don't<00:02:14.430> know

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
is it like a high-altitude I don't know

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.000 
is it like a high-altitude I don't know
but<00:02:15.209> something<00:02:15.450> really<00:02:16.140> interesting<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.890> look

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
but something really interesting to look

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.770 
but something really interesting to look
at<00:02:17.220> is<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.520> fact<00:02:17.760> that<00:02:17.819> is<00:02:18.090> raining<00:02:18.630> and

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
mind blown yeah that's very weird i may

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.820

be<00:02:27.569> the<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:29.160> npcs<00:02:29.580> function<00:02:30.090> normal<00:02:30.830> like

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
be the the the npcs function normal like

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.949 
be the the the npcs function normal like
they<00:02:32.010> don't<00:02:32.370> have<00:02:32.519> any<00:02:32.760> increased<00:02:33.300> features

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
they don't have any increased features

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.229

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
but when it starts raining the mobs

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.059 
but when it starts raining the mobs

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
react differently like the goldfish that

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.479 
react differently like the goldfish that
walking<00:02:38.610> on<00:02:38.730> land<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:39.410> the<00:02:40.410> slimes<00:02:40.800> pull<00:02:41.370> out

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
walking on land and the slimes pull out

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.030

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
it drops the umbrella and it functions

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.920 
it drops the umbrella and it functions
kind<00:02:46.470> of<00:02:46.590> like<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:48.060> cloud<00:02:48.299> in<00:02:48.510> a<00:02:48.600> balloon
