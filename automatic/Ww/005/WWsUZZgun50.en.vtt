okay<00:00:03.299> so<00:00:03.360> I've<00:00:03.569> been<00:00:03.629> asked<00:00:03.810> to<00:00:03.899> do<00:00:04.020> a<00:00:04.049> video

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
okay so I've been asked to do a video

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.079 
okay so I've been asked to do a video
about<00:00:04.380> posture<00:00:04.950> perhaps<00:00:05.490> something<00:00:05.640> I<00:00:05.850> think

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
about posture perhaps something I think

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.849 
about posture perhaps something I think
about<00:00:06.269> quite<00:00:06.479> a<00:00:06.569> lot<00:00:06.660> ice<00:00:06.899> I<00:00:07.139> struggled<00:00:07.769> with

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
about quite a lot ice I struggled with

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.259 
about quite a lot ice I struggled with
in<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.040> past<00:00:08.219> and<00:00:08.340> still<00:00:08.519> do<00:00:08.730> sometimes<00:00:09.000> when

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
in the past and still do sometimes when

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.250 
in the past and still do sometimes when
I'm<00:00:09.389> under<00:00:09.540> pressure<00:00:09.570> especially<00:00:09.870> in<00:00:10.170> the

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
I'm under pressure especially in the

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.620 
I'm under pressure especially in the
orchestra<00:00:10.730> some<00:00:11.730> of<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:11.910> key<00:00:12.059> points<00:00:12.269> I<00:00:12.480> would

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
orchestra some of the key points I would

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.950 
orchestra some of the key points I would
think<00:00:12.780> about<00:00:12.900> with<00:00:13.800> posture<00:00:14.599> the<00:00:15.599> way<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:15.720> would

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
think about with posture the way I would

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.300 
think about with posture the way I would
describe<00:00:16.260> it<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.590> that<00:00:16.679> was<00:00:16.800> described<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.160> me

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
describe it and that was described to me

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.269 
describe it and that was described to me
is<00:00:17.810> to<00:00:18.810> think<00:00:18.839> of<00:00:19.109> yourself<00:00:19.589> as<00:00:19.739> a<00:00:19.769> skeleton

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
is to think of yourself as a skeleton

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.970 
is to think of yourself as a skeleton
and<00:00:20.489> to<00:00:21.060> really<00:00:21.329> break<00:00:21.539> down<00:00:21.599> the<00:00:21.869> way<00:00:22.739> that

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
and to really break down the way that

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.370 
and to really break down the way that
you<00:00:23.099> hold<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.460> flute<00:00:23.669> so<00:00:24.300> if<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:24.779> just<00:00:24.989> go<00:00:25.109> side

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
you hold the flute so if I just go side

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.790 
you hold the flute so if I just go side
on<00:00:25.589> to<00:00:25.919> to<00:00:26.759> help<00:00:26.939> demonstrate<00:00:27.239> just<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.989> basic

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
on to to help demonstrate just a basic

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.469 
on to to help demonstrate just a basic
way<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:28.919> bringing<00:00:29.159> the<00:00:29.339> flute<00:00:29.550> up<00:00:29.729> to<00:00:29.939> towards

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:30.479 
way of bringing the flute up to towards

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:31.939 
way of bringing the flute up to towards
you<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:31.109> most<00:00:31.289> important<00:00:31.619> thing<00:00:31.710> is<00:00:31.800> not

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
you the most important thing is not

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.710 
you the most important thing is not
actually<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.399> lean<00:00:32.700> forward<00:00:32.730> towards<00:00:33.630> the

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
actually to lean forward towards the

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.530 
actually to lean forward towards the
fleet<00:00:33.930> which<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.260> very<00:00:34.710> easy<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.010> do<00:00:35.330> is<00:00:36.330> to

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
fleet which is very easy to do is to

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.300 
fleet which is very easy to do is to
keep<00:00:36.720> your<00:00:36.780> head<00:00:37.110> upright<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.770> imagine<00:00:38.100> the

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:38.310 
keep your head upright and imagine the

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.160 
keep your head upright and imagine the
sort<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.910> Alexander<00:00:39.390> Technique<00:00:39.570> way<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:39.990> doing

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
sort of Alexander Technique way of doing

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.840 
sort of Alexander Technique way of doing
things<00:00:40.350> very<00:00:40.410> imagine<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.430> somebody<00:00:41.700> is

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
things very imagine that somebody is

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.660 
things very imagine that somebody is
literally<00:00:42.150> pulling<00:00:42.450> your<00:00:42.630> spine<00:00:43.590> up<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:43.830> a

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
literally pulling your spine up and a

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.920 
literally pulling your spine up and a
piece<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.030> string<00:00:45.120> through<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.570> top<00:00:45.810> of<00:00:45.840> your

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
piece of string through the top of your

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.320 
piece of string through the top of your
head<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.380> that<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.280> don't<00:00:47.520> lean<00:00:47.880> forward

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:48.330 
head so that you you don't lean forward

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.080 
head so that you you don't lean forward
to<00:00:48.540> the<00:00:48.870> flute<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:50.100> just<00:00:50.520> hold<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.790> flute<00:00:50.970> in

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
to the flute so just hold the flute in

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.490 
to the flute so just hold the flute in
your<00:00:51.180> left<00:00:51.330> hand<00:00:51.540> with<00:00:51.720> a<00:00:51.750> left<00:00:52.140> hand<00:00:52.290> playing

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
your left hand with a left hand playing

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.430 
your left hand with a left hand playing
position<00:00:53.120> and<00:00:54.120> bring<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.660> up<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:55.079> your<00:00:55.200> face

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
position and bring it up to your face

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.640 
position and bring it up to your face
this<00:00:56.430> way<00:00:56.670> without<00:00:57.630> moving<00:00:58.079> your<00:00:58.110> head<00:00:58.350> and

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:58.650 
this way without moving your head and

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.800 
this way without moving your head and
then<00:00:59.280> all<00:00:59.760> you<00:00:59.880> do<00:01:00.030> with<00:01:00.150> the<00:01:00.239> right<00:01:00.390> hand<00:01:00.630> is

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:00.810 
then all you do with the right hand is

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.229 
then all you do with the right hand is
just<00:01:00.870> bring<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:02.130> on<00:01:02.280> top<00:01:02.489> like<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.700> bunch<00:01:03.090> of

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
just bring it on top like a bunch of

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.169 
just bring it on top like a bunch of
bananas<00:01:03.390> or<00:01:04.350> or<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.040> skeleton<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.759> I<00:01:05.820> say<00:01:06.000> that

00:01:06.169 --> 00:01:06.179 
bananas or or a skeleton and I say that

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:08.480 
bananas or or a skeleton and I say that
there's<00:01:06.479> no<00:01:06.689> muscle<00:01:07.140> involved<00:01:07.710> with<00:01:07.859> that<00:01:07.979> and

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
there's no muscle involved with that and

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.090 
there's no muscle involved with that and
this<00:01:09.450> should<00:01:09.899> be<00:01:10.020> in<00:01:10.140> natural<00:01:10.530> plane<00:01:10.710> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
this should be in natural plane the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.279 
this should be in natural plane the
other<00:01:11.249> thing<00:01:11.460> too<00:01:11.819> to<00:01:12.270> watch<00:01:12.630> out<00:01:12.810> for<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.109> it

00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:13.289 
other thing too to watch out for is it

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:15.649 
other thing too to watch out for is it
never<00:01:13.890> play<00:01:14.159> with<00:01:14.310> your<00:01:14.399> feet<00:01:14.640> square<00:01:15.119> stunt

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
never play with your feet square stunt

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.529 
never play with your feet square stunt

straight on towards the audience and it

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:20.629 
straight on towards the audience and it
should<00:01:18.749> always<00:01:19.109> be<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.560> your<00:01:19.740> left<00:01:20.159> foot<00:01:20.310> is

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
directly going forward to 45 degrees

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:25.010 
directly going forward to 45 degrees
towards<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.939> corner<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.389> wherever<00:01:24.780> you're

head comes to 90 degrees towards the
audience<00:01:40.520> so<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.549> instead<00:01:42.179> of<00:01:42.240> having<00:01:42.450> both

bit space be slightly pointed and the

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.750 
bit space be slightly pointed and the
flute<00:03:09.690> should<00:03:10.350> not<00:03:10.620> be<00:03:10.860> twisted<00:03:11.280> round<00:03:11.400> here

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
flute should not be twisted round here

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.949 
flute should not be twisted round here
so<00:03:11.910> that<00:03:12.060> you're<00:03:12.150> twisting<00:03:12.420> it<00:03:12.510> back<00:03:12.540> but<00:03:12.900> just

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
so that you're twisting it back but just

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.530 
so that you're twisting it back but just
naturally<00:03:13.950> in<00:03:14.010> like<00:03:14.310> 90<00:03:14.880> degrees<00:03:14.910> to<00:03:15.390> where

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
naturally in like 90 degrees to where

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.350 
naturally in like 90 degrees to where
you're<00:03:15.750> playing<00:03:15.959> to<00:03:16.650> so<00:03:17.340> hopefully<00:03:18.209> this

you're playing to so hopefully this

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.360 
you're playing to so hopefully this
would<00:03:18.510> be<00:03:18.660> somewhere<00:03:19.410> near<00:03:19.620> a<00:03:19.650> good<00:03:20.070> playing

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
would be somewhere near a good playing
