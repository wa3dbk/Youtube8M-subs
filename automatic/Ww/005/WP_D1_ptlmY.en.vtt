taking<00:00:03.899> a<00:00:03.990> look<00:00:04.200> at<00:00:04.440> a<00:00:04.470> office<00:00:05.160> complex<00:00:06.060> that's

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
taking a look at a office complex that's

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.690 
taking a look at a office complex that's
probably<00:00:07.470> been<00:00:07.680> hit<00:00:07.859> pretty<00:00:08.130> hard<00:00:08.280> by<00:00:08.519> the

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
probably been hit pretty hard by the

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.060 
probably been hit pretty hard by the
economy<00:00:09.389> and<00:00:09.480> probably<00:00:09.840> looking<00:00:10.349> for<00:00:10.830> new

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
economy and probably looking for new

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.029 
economy and probably looking for new
tenants<00:00:12.290> probably<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:13.320> little<00:00:13.500> bit<00:00:14.150> low<00:00:15.150> on<00:00:15.179> the

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:16.039 
tenants probably a little bit low on the

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.090 
tenants probably a little bit low on the
pretty<00:00:17.039> high<00:00:17.160> on<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.430> vacancy<00:00:17.940> rate<00:00:19.100> well

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
pretty high on the vacancy rate well

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.740 
pretty high on the vacancy rate well
they<00:00:20.160> got<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.340> lot<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.520> ash<00:00:20.760> trees<00:00:21.060> so<00:00:21.600> we're

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
they got a lot of ash trees so we're

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.090 
they got a lot of ash trees so we're
going<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:21.930> take<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.109> look<00:00:22.289> at<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.560> ash<00:00:22.710> trees

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
going to take a look at the ash trees

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.740 
going to take a look at the ash trees
that

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
that

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.810 
that
this<00:00:25.110> particular<00:00:25.320> office<00:00:26.040> complex<00:00:26.610> had

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
this particular office complex had

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.080 
this particular office complex had
planted<00:00:27.420> proudly<00:00:27.869> 25<00:00:28.410> years<00:00:28.710> ago<00:00:31.880> look<00:00:32.880> at<00:00:33.000> the

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
planted proudly 25 years ago look at the

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.910 
planted proudly 25 years ago look at the
maintenance<00:00:33.510> that's<00:00:33.750> been<00:00:33.930> taken<00:00:34.260> place

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
maintenance that's been taken place

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.360 
maintenance that's been taken place
since<00:00:35.370> then<00:00:35.820> bedtime<00:00:36.950> these<00:00:37.950> trees<00:00:38.160> have<00:00:38.309> been

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
since then bedtime these trees have been

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.250 
since then bedtime these trees have been
an<00:00:38.580> well<00:00:38.760> established<00:00:39.450> providing<00:00:39.930> value<00:00:40.230> to

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
an well established providing value to

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.960 
an well established providing value to
this<00:00:40.440> property<00:00:40.739> probably<00:00:41.460> made<00:00:41.580> it<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.790> lot

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
this property probably made it a lot

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.610 
this property probably made it a lot
easier<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.449> lease<00:00:42.750> from<00:00:42.989> these<00:00:43.140> trees<00:00:43.379> with

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
easier to lease from these trees with

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.430 
easier to lease from these trees with
healthy<00:00:44.239> but<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.600> can<00:00:45.780> obviously<00:00:46.050> take<00:00:46.379> a

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
healthy but you can obviously take a

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.630 
healthy but you can obviously take a
look<00:00:46.650> at<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.830> condition<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.280> these<00:00:47.430> trees

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
look at the condition of these trees

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.460 
look at the condition of these trees
right<00:00:47.699> now<00:00:48.800> EAB<00:00:49.800> has<00:00:49.980> been<00:00:50.100> in<00:00:50.250> elgin<00:00:50.670> for<00:00:51.470> 67

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
right now EAB has been in elgin for 67

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.950 
right now EAB has been in elgin for 67
years<00:00:52.699> and<00:00:53.699> these<00:00:54.120> trees<00:00:54.390> have<00:00:54.510> obviously

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
years and these trees have obviously

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.340 
years and these trees have obviously
been<00:00:55.080> infested<00:00:55.559> for<00:00:55.949> six<00:00:56.160> or<00:00:56.309> seven<00:00:56.610> years

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350

gonna<00:01:38.539> have<00:01:38.630> to<00:01:38.689> be<00:01:38.780> cut<00:01:38.869> down<00:01:39.049> because<00:01:39.860> if<00:01:40.009> you

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
gonna have to be cut down because if you

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.139 
gonna have to be cut down because if you
leave<00:01:40.250> them<00:01:40.460> stand<00:01:40.700> and<00:01:40.909> they're<00:01:41.000> probably

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
leave them stand and they're probably

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:42.550 
leave them stand and they're probably
going<00:01:41.330> to<00:01:41.420> fall<00:01:41.570> on<00:01:41.750> his<00:01:41.869> roof<00:01:42.080> for<00:01:42.350> fall<00:01:42.530> and

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
again I don't want to shine in the Sun

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.160 
again I don't want to shine in the Sun
but<00:01:57.280> take<00:01:58.280> a<00:01:58.310> look<00:01:58.429> that's<00:01:58.840> tree<00:01:59.840> is<00:01:59.929> pretty

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
but take a look that's tree is pretty

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.949 
but take a look that's tree is pretty
much<00:02:00.289> dead<00:02:01.030> hey<00:02:02.030> there's<00:02:02.270> a<00:02:02.330> live<00:02:02.539> tree<00:02:02.810> oh

much dead hey there's a live tree oh

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:05.559 
much dead hey there's a live tree oh
it's<00:02:03.259> a<00:02:03.319> maple<00:02:03.970> wait<00:02:04.970> for<00:02:05.179> Asian<00:02:05.390> long-horned

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:05.569 
it's a maple wait for Asian long-horned

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:14.360 
it's a maple wait for Asian long-horned
beetle<00:02:05.840> I<00:02:06.080> guess<00:02:07.149> the<00:02:08.149> crabapple

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370
