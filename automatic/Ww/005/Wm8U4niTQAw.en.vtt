00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
train for it to one glass that's my one

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.740 
train for it to one glass that's my one
and<00:02:34.739> this<00:02:34.830> is<00:02:34.950> gent<00:02:35.160> ones<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:35.640> wipe-on<00:02:36.450> here

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
and this is gent ones and wipe-on here

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.020 
and this is gent ones and wipe-on here
is<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:36.900> sure<00:02:37.140> shot<00:02:37.170> this<00:02:37.739> measures<00:02:38.100> 25<00:02:38.489> mils<00:02:38.790> and

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
is a sure shot this measures 25 mils and

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.090 
is a sure shot this measures 25 mils and
so<00:02:39.989> it<00:02:40.049> means<00:02:40.170> instead<00:02:40.410> of<00:02:40.530> half<00:02:40.650> important

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
so it means instead of half important

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.030 
so it means instead of half important
something<00:02:41.430> I<00:02:41.549> can<00:02:41.790> simply<00:02:42.180> just<00:02:42.390> for<00:02:43.040> an
