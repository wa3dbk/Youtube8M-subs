00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
cowbell jam block stuff like that so you

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.800 
cowbell jam block stuff like that so you
can<00:01:14.280> make<00:01:14.400> kind<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.729> like<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.909> timbale<00:01:15.270> kit<00:01:15.659> out

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
can make kind of like a timbale kit out

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.740 
can make kind of like a timbale kit out
of<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.490> so<00:01:17.490> it's<00:01:17.670> actually<00:01:18.030> really<00:01:18.180> compact

Thor<00:01:20.729> modular<00:01:21.270> it's<00:01:21.570> all<00:01:21.869> based<00:01:22.110> on<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.470> tube

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
Thor modular it's all based on the tube

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.770 
Thor modular it's all based on the tube
system<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.460> goes<00:01:23.640> around<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.090> drum<00:01:24.420> there

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
system that goes around the drum there

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.440 
system that goes around the drum there
are<00:01:24.900> three<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.439> them<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:26.460> it<00:01:26.670> just<00:01:26.700> pivots<00:01:27.270> off

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
are three of them and it just pivots off

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.510 
are three of them and it just pivots off
that<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:27.990> everything<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.470> mounted<00:01:28.770> off<00:01:29.250> that

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
that and everything is mounted off that

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.620 
that and everything is mounted off that
bracket<00:01:29.850> system<00:01:30.530> so<00:01:31.640> enough<00:01:32.640> talking<00:01:32.939> let's

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
bracket system so enough talking let's

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.850 
bracket system so enough talking let's
play<00:01:33.900> these<00:01:34.049> things<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.530> see<00:01:34.619> how<00:01:34.650> they

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
play these things and see how they

00:01:34.860 --> 00:02:44.140 
play these things and see how they
really<00:01:35.040> sound

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150
