boiler with two pipes going to it it
gets<00:00:26.970> pulled<00:00:27.240> in<00:00:27.420> there<00:00:27.600> and<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:27.960> gets<00:00:28.140> pulled

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:28.350 
gets pulled in there and it gets pulled

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.189 
gets pulled in there and it gets pulled
back<00:00:28.500> out<00:00:28.800> again<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.100> gets<00:00:29.430> pumped<00:00:29.820> up<00:00:30.199> that's

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
back out again and gets pumped up that's

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:31.880

there<00:00:32.039> you<00:00:32.189> can<00:00:32.250> see<00:00:32.510> this<00:00:33.510> boiler<00:00:33.899> has<00:00:34.109> an

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
there you can see this boiler has an

and they probably can't see it but it's

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.559 
and they probably can't see it but it's

here through to the required circuits

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.870 
here through to the required circuits
where<00:01:48.270> it's<00:01:48.420> plated<00:01:48.720> three<00:01:49.080> circuits<00:01:49.710> one<00:01:50.670> for

the hot water tank one for downstairs
radiators<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.610> want<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.480> upstairs<00:01:54.840> radiators

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
radiators I want to upstairs radiators

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.250 
radiators I want to upstairs radiators
wanted<00:01:56.940> to<00:01:57.060> add<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.450> end<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.690> the<00:01:57.720> circuit

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
wanted to add that end of the circuit

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.440 
wanted to add that end of the circuit
it's<00:01:58.350> like<00:01:58.500> here<00:01:58.860> all<00:01:59.580> three<00:01:59.850> circuits

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
it's like here all three circuits

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.950 
it's like here all three circuits
drawing<00:02:00.810> back<00:02:00.930> up<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.860> one<00:02:02.040> pipe<00:02:02.540> and<00:02:03.540> go<00:02:03.659> back

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
drawing back up to one pipe and go back

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.040 
drawing back up to one pipe and go back
down<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.350> boiler<00:02:05.390> with<00:02:06.390> these<00:02:06.570> paths<00:02:06.810> as

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
down to the boiler with these paths as

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.050 
down to the boiler with these paths as
well<00:02:07.229> what's<00:02:07.650> a<00:02:07.770> bypass<00:02:08.340> pipe<00:02:08.700> this<00:02:09.000> pipe

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
well what's a bypass pipe this pipe

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.789 
well what's a bypass pipe this pipe
there<00:02:09.860> and<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:11.009> is<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:11.459> all<00:02:12.060> three<00:02:12.799> valves

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799 
there and that is so all three valves

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:16.220 
there and that is so all three valves
are<00:02:13.980> closing<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.459> pump<00:02:14.700> comes<00:02:14.939> on<00:02:15.150> it<00:02:15.989> can

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
are closing a pump comes on it can

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.559 
are closing a pump comes on it can
circulate<00:02:16.609> without<00:02:17.609> any<00:02:17.969> service

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
circulate without any service

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.429 
circulate without any service
being<00:02:18.749> on<00:02:18.900> it's<00:02:19.049> like<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.200> safety<00:02:19.709> feature<00:02:19.920> so

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:21.439 
being on it's like a safety feature so

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:24.949 
being on it's like a safety feature so
basically<00:02:22.439> it's<00:02:22.739> a<00:02:22.799> circulation<00:02:23.519> system<00:02:23.999> of

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
basically it's a circulation system of

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.899 
basically it's a circulation system of
water<00:02:25.170> where<00:02:25.709> it<00:02:25.889> gets<00:02:26.129> split<00:02:26.459> to<00:02:26.609> three

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
water where it gets split to three

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:30.080 
water where it gets split to three
different<00:02:27.299> zones<00:02:28.310> it<00:02:29.310> gets<00:02:29.519> pumped<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.909> three

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
different zones it gets pumped to three

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.000 
different zones it gets pumped to three
different<00:02:30.239> zones<00:02:30.599> joined<00:02:31.349> back<00:02:31.560> up<00:02:31.739> again

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
different zones joined back up again

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.190 
different zones joined back up again
first<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.909> boiler<00:02:33.329> gets<00:02:33.540> pulled<00:02:33.780> behind<00:02:33.930> the

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
first a boiler gets pulled behind the

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.199 
first a boiler gets pulled behind the
boiler<00:02:34.349> and<00:02:34.499> gets<00:02:34.709> pumped<00:02:35.189> big<00:02:35.549> round<00:02:35.879> again

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209

expansion<00:02:39.389> pipe<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.769> that<00:02:40.799> is<00:02:41.040> rely

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
expansion pipe and that is rely

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.809 
expansion pipe and that is rely
