00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
that you can recommend that hard drives

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.450 
that you can recommend that hard drives
have<00:00:26.490> become<00:00:26.849> commoditized<00:00:28.070> you<00:00:29.070> know<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.250> mean

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
have become commoditized you know I mean

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.859 
have become commoditized you know I mean
when<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.640> say<00:00:29.820> come<00:00:30.029> on<00:00:30.150> it's<00:00:30.330> like<00:00:30.449> pork

they're all the same and the technology

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.069 
they're all the same and the technology
once<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.770> technology<00:00:41.010> becomes<00:00:41.460> mature<00:00:42.079> and

Western<00:01:07.110> Digital<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:08.869> was<00:01:09.869> actually<00:01:10.229> looking

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
Western Digital I was actually looking

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.679 
Western Digital I was actually looking
at<00:01:10.950> Western<00:01:11.400> Digital<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.970> when<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.420> look<00:01:12.600> at

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
at Western Digital and when I look at

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.450 
at Western Digital and when I look at
what<00:01:12.840> they<00:01:12.960> have<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.530> they<00:01:14.040> seem<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.340> have<00:01:14.400> a

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
what they have the they seem to have a

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.390 
what they have the they seem to have a
color-coded<00:01:14.880> yes<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.750> have<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> black<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.220> Blues

color-coded yes I have a black the Blues

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.730 
color-coded yes I have a black the Blues
there<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:17.850> yeah<00:01:18.360> I'm<00:01:18.840> not<00:01:19.049> sure<00:01:19.080> if<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.500> ribs

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
there is yeah I'm not sure if the ribs

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.770 
there is yeah I'm not sure if the ribs
which<00:01:20.070> they're<00:01:20.310> selling<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:21.060> stripes<00:01:21.450> would

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
which they're selling in a stripes would

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.080 
which they're selling in a stripes would
make<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.590> good<00:01:23.070> desktop<00:01:23.640> choice<00:01:23.880> probably<00:01:24.570> not

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
make a good desktop choice probably not

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.460 
make a good desktop choice probably not
the<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:28.070> an<00:01:29.070> ass<00:01:29.369> drive<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:29.970> all<00:01:30.150> about<00:01:30.509> not

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
the the an ass drive is all about not

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.819 
the the an ass drive is all about not
speed<00:01:32.100> but<00:01:32.729> just<00:01:33.200> continuous<00:01:34.200> it's<00:01:34.380> always<00:01:34.619> on

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
speed but just continuous it's always on

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.410 
speed but just continuous it's always on
right<00:01:35.360> and<00:01:36.380> so<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.500> Reds<00:01:37.770> tend<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.430> be<00:01:38.579> great

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
right and so the Reds tend to be great

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.039 
right and so the Reds tend to be great
at<00:01:39.689> always<00:01:40.680> being<00:01:40.950> on<00:01:41.479> there's<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.689> know<00:01:42.810> the

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
at always being on there's you know the

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.060 
at always being on there's you know the
black<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.740> more<00:01:44.220> expensive<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.119> faster<00:01:46.070> I'm

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
black is more expensive and faster I'm

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.380 
black is more expensive and faster I'm
trying<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.579> remember<00:01:47.729> what<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.090> different

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
trying to remember what the different

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.870 
trying to remember what the different
colors<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:49.140> wish<00:01:49.799> there<00:01:49.950> were<00:01:50.040> also<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.610> blue

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
colors I wish there were also the blue

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.969 
colors I wish there were also the blue
and<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.240> green<00:01:51.420> one<00:01:51.659> yeah<00:01:51.930> green<00:01:52.350> one<00:01:52.619> which<00:01:52.860> I

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
and the green one yeah green one which I

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.429 
and the green one yeah green one which I
use<00:01:53.100> as<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.250> backup<00:01:53.759> drive<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.689> green<00:01:54.960> is<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.140> low

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
use as a backup drive and green is a low

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.800 
use as a backup drive and green is a low
power<00:01:55.649> as<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.280> would<00:01:56.430> expect<00:01:56.520> right<00:01:56.939> that's

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
power as you would expect right that's

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.420 
power as you would expect right that's
correct<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.259> it's<00:01:58.350> slow<00:01:58.619> as<00:01:58.799> well<00:01:59.009> so<00:01:59.399> I

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
correct and it's slow as well so I

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.060 
correct and it's slow as well so I
wanted<00:01:59.880> to<00:01:59.939> have<00:02:00.060> something<00:02:00.680> let's<00:02:01.680> hang<00:02:01.890> on

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
wanted to have something let's hang on

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.230 
wanted to have something let's hang on
and<00:02:02.219> we<00:02:02.549> got<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.729> take<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.850> break<00:02:03.000> when<00:02:03.149> we<00:02:03.180> come

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
and we got to take a break when we come

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.569 
and we got to take a break when we come
back<00:02:03.450> let's<00:02:03.600> talk<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.840> little<00:02:03.990> more<00:02:04.079> about<00:02:04.170> this

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579 
back let's talk a little more about this

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:07.609 
back let's talk a little more about this

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
with mark about hard drives and I you

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.170 
with mark about hard drives and I you
know<00:02:13.830> I<00:02:13.860> don't

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
know I don't

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.449

No<00:02:14.450> you<00:02:15.079> hear<00:02:15.530> I<00:02:15.560> think<00:02:15.739> the<00:02:16.040> difference<00:02:16.400> is

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
No you hear I think the difference is

so many colors and the green is
eco-friendly<00:02:49.510> which<00:02:50.510> probably<00:02:50.840> means<00:02:51.260> slower

high-performance drive and this is what

high-performance drive and this is what
I<00:03:27.859> usually<00:03:28.069> buy<00:03:28.340> that<00:03:28.549> by<00:03:28.729> the<00:03:29.019> velociraptors

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
I usually buy that by the velociraptors

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.500 
I usually buy that by the velociraptors

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:33.939 
when I don't buy spinning drives anymore
but<00:03:32.629> when<00:03:32.720> I<00:03:32.750> bought<00:03:33.019> spinning<00:03:33.319> drives<00:03:33.560> those

are<00:03:34.159> 10,000<00:03:34.760> rpm<00:03:35.150> and<00:03:35.569> you<00:03:35.689> know<00:03:35.810> they

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
are 10,000 rpm and you know they

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:36.729 
are 10,000 rpm and you know they
probably<00:03:36.079> don't<00:03:36.379> make<00:03:36.470> that<00:03:36.560> much<00:03:36.680> difference

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
probably don't make that much difference

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.460 
probably don't make that much difference
in<00:03:37.189> speed<00:03:37.629> SSD<00:03:38.629> makes<00:03:38.840> such<00:03:39.019> a<00:03:39.049> difference<00:03:39.139> but

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
in speed SSD makes such a difference but

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.619 
in speed SSD makes such a difference but
the<00:03:39.560> capacities<00:03:40.250> tend<00:03:41.120> to<00:03:41.180> be<00:03:41.299> lower<00:03:41.479> because

the capacities tend to be lower because

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:43.210 
the capacities tend to be lower because

an SSD that I use as my boot drive
application<00:04:19.519> drive<00:04:19.699> that's<00:04:19.880> exactly<00:04:20.389> what

you<00:04:20.599> should<00:04:20.630> do<00:04:20.959> so<00:04:21.169> then<00:04:21.349> yeah<00:04:21.500> so<00:04:21.709> and<00:04:22.070> this

00:04:22.149 --> 00:04:22.159 
you should do so then yeah so and this

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:24.899 
you should do so then yeah so and this
is<00:04:22.279> what<00:04:22.430> I<00:04:22.460> recommend<00:04:22.870> 128<00:04:23.870> gigabyte<00:04:24.320> SSD

00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:24.909 
is what I recommend 128 gigabyte SSD

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:27.320 
is what I recommend 128 gigabyte SSD
that's<00:04:25.909> where<00:04:26.210> your<00:04:26.389> your<00:04:26.840> window

00:04:29.179 --> 00:04:29.189 
is where your apps are and then you put

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:32.059

its training drive yeah that's a good

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.200 
its training drive yeah that's a good
way<00:04:36.120> to<00:04:36.150> do<00:04:36.360> it<00:04:37.280> now<00:04:38.280> if<00:04:38.580> you<00:04:38.759> look<00:04:39.000> at

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
way to do it now if you look at

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.050 
way to do it now if you look at

we'd<00:04:50.550> be<00:04:50.669> buying<00:04:50.879> nothing<00:04:51.349> but<00:04:52.349> hitachi

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:53.449

drives<00:04:54.449> the<00:04:54.659> problem<00:04:54.990> is<00:04:55.139> that<00:04:55.319> they<00:04:55.469> they

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
drives the problem is that they they

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:57.429 
drives the problem is that they they
tend<00:04:56.159> to<00:04:56.219> be<00:04:56.370> more<00:04:56.550> expensive

00:04:57.429 --> 00:04:57.439 
tend to be more expensive

00:04:57.439 --> 00:05:00.260 
tend to be more expensive
I<00:04:58.439> think<00:04:59.099> Western<00:04:59.370> Digital<00:04:59.520> bought<00:04:59.879> Hitachi

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
I think Western Digital bought Hitachi

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.379 
I think Western Digital bought Hitachi
do<00:05:00.509> they<00:05:00.659> not<00:05:01.310> so<00:05:02.310> but<00:05:02.669> I<00:05:02.699> think<00:05:03.000> you<00:05:03.060> can<00:05:03.210> get

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:03.389 
do they not so but I think you can get

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:04.730 
do they not so but I think you can get
them<00:05:03.569> as<00:05:03.659> Hitachi<00:05:04.050> brand<00:05:04.469> they've<00:05:04.620> been

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
them as Hitachi brand they've been

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.379 
them as Hitachi brand they've been
rock-solid<00:05:05.159> have<00:05:05.400> remarkably<00:05:05.849> low<00:05:06.030> failure

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
rock-solid have remarkably low failure

rock-solid have remarkably low failure
rate<00:05:06.539> my<00:05:07.020> problem<00:05:07.409> is<00:05:07.530> that<00:05:07.560> this<00:05:07.830> changes

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 
rate my problem is that this changes

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:10.510 
rate my problem is that this changes
from<00:05:08.699> time<00:05:09.060> to<00:05:09.210> time

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520

Western did you light a problem with

Western did you light a problem with

firmware for a while that caused some

firmware for a while that caused some
issues<00:05:14.849> I<00:05:15.090> mean<00:05:15.240> it<00:05:15.360> just<00:05:15.479> I<00:05:16.069> don't<00:05:17.069> know<00:05:17.280> if

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
issues I mean it just I don't know if

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.159 
issues I mean it just I don't know if
there<00:05:17.550> it's<00:05:17.729> it's<00:05:18.120> commodity<00:05:18.719> in<00:05:18.840> the<00:05:18.930> sense

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
there it's it's commodity in the sense

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:20.959 
there it's it's commodity in the sense
that<00:05:19.229> they're<00:05:19.500> all<00:05:19.529> kind<00:05:19.889> of<00:05:20.069> good<00:05:20.729> and<00:05:20.879> all

00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:20.969 
that they're all kind of good and all

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:24.110 
that they're all kind of good and all
kind<00:05:21.210> of<00:05:21.270> bad<00:05:22.009> so<00:05:23.009> I<00:05:23.039> don't<00:05:23.279> I<00:05:23.430> don't<00:05:23.699> know<00:05:23.879> what

that week the enterprise grades for the
servers<00:07:23.820> yeah<00:07:24.030> we<00:07:24.210> need<00:07:24.360> to<00:07:24.510> because<00:07:24.720> they

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:24.810 
servers yeah we need to because they

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:26.060 
servers yeah we need to because they
have<00:07:24.930> to<00:07:25.020> be<00:07:25.110> rated<00:07:25.290> for<00:07:25.530> the<00:07:25.560> server<00:07:25.800> so<00:07:25.950> they

think<00:07:29.610> if<00:07:29.700> you<00:07:29.790> can<00:07:30.030> use<00:07:30.360> a<00:07:30.390> solid-state<00:07:31.200> drive

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:31.230 
think if you can use a solid-state drive

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:33.830 
think if you can use a solid-state drive
