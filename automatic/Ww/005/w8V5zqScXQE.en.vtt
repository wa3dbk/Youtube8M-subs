00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 I'm proud we're here can you 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.020
 they are 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.950
 and for these elements 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.299
 the link between cancer 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:12.489
 however, that the link between cancer and pesticides 

00:00:12.489 --> 00:00:15.489
 clearly demonstrated now mainly from studies 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:17.630
 does it in a professional environment 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.630
 we are much less net actually on the stock market 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.749
 the study published between them 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:27.140
 pesticides found in food and cancer 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.179
 this exposure is added to rest rest pollution including 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:33.820
 Moreover his domestic risks are domestic professional reasons 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.040
 school the pair and studies 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.350
 epidemiological studies that are conducted in humans has been done 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.790
 recently by a team 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.790
 the Canadian academic 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.590
 and as this team shows that in 90% of cases 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.640
 we call for the 80's 83 'the most rights 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.330
 she was planning to publish as 90% gives 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.940
 positive Iranian result between them 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.940
 for certain types of cancer and that the exposure 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.930
 are mainly of its leaders like brain tumors that are numerous 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.220
 highlighted 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.890
 and more particularly on the year 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.180
 impacts on children 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.180
 I believe that very little 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.680
 what we know 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.580
 very clearly today thanks to a study 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.510
 conducted speech 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.110
 that is, recouch 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.100
 published in 2004 and the cancer of the child a big europe progresses 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.480
 it grew by 1% 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.100
 for thirty years 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.380
 he progressed for adolescent cancer did not have more than 5% and 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.600
 looters 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.000
 an acceleration of this trend tel 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.300
 the repo rate that of today 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.320
 that in the 70s 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.830
 and that the main explanation that we can find this progression of this 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.830
 equipment it is explained the link 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.830
 pesticides 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.190
 childhood cancers 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.560
 which is mainly maternal disposition but also the exhibition 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.150
 father 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.910
 the bombards 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.710
 I felt more comfortable publishing in 2007 the study observes show 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.529
 kepel of the year between expulsion justified that 

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:11.899
 senegal photo at the child 

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:13.449
 we have proof 

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:16.329
 the synthesis that had been published in the usa about ten years and 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:18.529
 has been confirmed by two 

00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:20.949
 we've seen people dozens of studies all going in the same 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:21.849
 meaning 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.930
 we have a fairly close link between the exhibition 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:30.859
 to pesticides or professional exclusion 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:31.589
