00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:13.950
 audi a8 and 7er bmw that bavarian duel 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.460
 the upper class Ingolstadt all 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.699
 high tech against Munich kid baroque im 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.060
 test the a8 4.2 quarter 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.310
 his v8 with 335 ps has no trouble with 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.590
 the almost 1.8 tonnes live weight of the 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.900
 allradler's promised consumption 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.079
 of 11.9 liters sounds very much 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.149
 optimistic bmw promises the 7 45 g 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.660
 even one liter less consumption 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.700
 amazing because its 333 ps haul 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.800
 almost 200 kilos more around 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.960
 However, he has only rear-wheel drive 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.719
 priced both are identical 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.460
 high level of different can 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.860
 eight cylinders hardly be packed 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.899
 on the one hand the massive bmw with 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.210
 hack backpack on the other side of the 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.539
 elegant filigree in some details 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.539
 audi 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.850
 Tear bags and define that 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.540
 frontdesign of the munich polarized 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.820
 consistent against the front of the car 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.590
 The page line of the BMW is going to be massive 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.080
 a castle and ends in the stone of 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.190
 offense for this trunk there 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.120
 only two opinions 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.120
 top or flop 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.420
 wide and crisp so has a butt 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.420
 look up 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.100
 the audi is 4 cm longer and five 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.690
 centimeters lower than the bmw 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.330
 it will be against the chunky one 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.950
 This almost makes it happen 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:53.230
 coupé-like winner in the chapter emotions 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:55.210
 and design of the audi a8 two thick v8 with 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.520
 approximately the same performance in 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.680
 The bmw has 450 torque 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.660
 Newton meters offer exactly 20 more than 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.640
 the audi promise the data 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.640
 Equal, and so it is 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:14.780
 in 6 3 seconds, both tune to 100 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.780
 and at 250 is of course ending 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.660
 slow an exercise both thanks to no 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.840
 mastering regulatory abs well 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:30.989
 the vfb stands after 36 9 meters 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.379
 the audi comes to a standstill after 37 meters 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.269
 almost equal here at the 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.250
 handling then the difference the 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.470
 was deflection of the target 7, the ship's 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.870
 unerringly through the pylons but the 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.670
 thick egg to rock up with paired 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.950
 bmw 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.950
 clear that he is more influential 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.310
 the audi surprised with his direct 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.900
 steering and the hardt tuned 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.060
 The agile becomes agile like one 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.640
 middle class sedan and really greed 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.110
 after quick changes of direction in the 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:09.000
 ingolstädter is fast on fun 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:12.050
 He wins the chapter performance 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.050
 if only just 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:22.200
 bulky outside needs you inside everything 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.060
 great in the bmw werk and respectful 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.730
 the huge steering wheel with the two 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.770
 Sounds a little clunky 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.600
 automatic selector lever was clever 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:34.680
 and you can do it quickly with the 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.600
 Activity confused the seats are 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.340
 the perfect seems to be 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.180
 cumbersome presentation offers occasion 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.940
 to the criticism 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.610
 as well as a drive computer freaks 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.770
 Like others, it is too complicated 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.420
 especially when it comes to the things that 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.420
 you do not have to adjust daily 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.120
 start by fingerprint this 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:59.260
 Special equipment is available in high-tech 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.510
 cockpit of the 8th 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.939
 the steering wheel is in contrast to that of the 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.680
 bmw almost fragile and the selector lever 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:08.230
 is where he belongs 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:12.219
 the seats are padded a bit harder 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:14.769
 but however, will not uncomfortable the 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:16.989
 control system mmi also with a 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:18.180
 knob directly much more thoughtful 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.639
 as the 1 3 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:32.289
 everything is self-explanatory 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:35.530
 for the 8 cheap they are both not 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:37.449
 a good 74,000 euros basic price can be 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.220
 easily increase to 100,000 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:40.720
 also in the tax and in the 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.500
 insurance are close to the 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.930
 par 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.720
 only in the fully comprehensive is the bmw 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.580
 much cheaper than the audi of 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.430
 then also needs a good 15 liters 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.099
 super plus and therefore around 15 liters more 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.660
 as the bmw the factory information is included 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:05:04.419
 both incomprehensible 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:06.550
 point for the Munich in bmw you travel 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:11.580
 comfortable but must be weight 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.580
 costs driving dynamics conclusion of the luxury liners 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.860
 the audi shines through its perfect 

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:20.860
 Processing and agile handling 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.979
 the consumption is very high ours 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:26.229
 conclusion the sport sedan was rare 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:28.210
 two test candidates so close together 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:30.220
 but in the sum of all details goes 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.960
 then the audi in leadership and 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.960
 decides this comparison for itself
