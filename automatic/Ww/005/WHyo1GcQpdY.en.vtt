00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.630
 Feria de Puebla was invaded by 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.840
 dinosaurs and it's not about the child 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.840

 in the area of ​​animatronics 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.320
 it's like I'm really in the 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.930
 epochs I will dedicate the journey starts 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.610
 right here with little bones who will have 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.600
 to feed him so he can 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.600
 continue on his way 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.490
 for him 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.310
 are I look like 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.040
 does it move 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:54.090
 how they do it and how well they explain it to you 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.340
 so come and enjoy it 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.680
 forward you will find the bitter saurian with 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.690
 his great thorns lived throughout 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.630
 of the neck and back while a 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.700
 a few steps the oldest Stegosaurus 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.520
 of the dinosaurs anxiously awaits 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.960
 his arrival the most characteristic of this 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.670
 he opened us are the eyebrows he has for 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.920
 his entire back that was served to him 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.040
 regulate the temperature of his body and he 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.690
 is one of the oldest believed to be left 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.479
 coming 200 million years ago 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.729
 back and most characteristic is that it 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.710
 he thinks he had no saliva then for 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.020
 help your digestion had to swallow 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.390
 stones too and that was 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.610
 uncomfortable that's why the eyebrows are a 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.200
 color as reddish because it is believed that 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.300
 until you get to sweat blood from both 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.400
 effort but walk with care because 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:43.240
 you could be the next prey of 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.250
 this little one is about the carnotauro the 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.320
 most dangerous predator in South America 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.200
 with 10 meters long and one speed 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.600
 of 45 kilometers per hour to whom by 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.100
 true if you do not want to enrage him 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.060
 we recommend avoiding 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.060
 place it in hand 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.310
 merger so by the resemblance to the horns 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.250
 to the bulls simply and those horns 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.170
 they used to hunt and he Nomás 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.060
 was hiding and when a 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.030
 dinosaur jumped to nail the 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.800
 horns and as we see his little hands were 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.200
 very tiny because it is believed that they are not 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.660
 they served him for nothing if it is believed that 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.459
 he died of itching of course he could not 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.620
 missing the king of the dinosaurs we are 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.500
 speaking just about the tyrannosaurus rex 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.350
 here we have a copy is just 6 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.930
 years old, a baby but that was already 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.540
 around 6 meters long and weighed 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.260
 one ton however at this age 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.060
 well, they were totally 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.220
 independent so they could hunt in 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.290
 change the adults came to measure 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:51.970
 up to 14 meters long and weigh 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:53.830
 around 5 and 6 tons that age 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.360
 because I like those of the 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.730
 dinosaurs 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.990
 Yes, which one do you like the most? 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:04.060
 wise record that because it's ours and he 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:07.270
 is carnivore what I liked the most was to see 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:10.510
 to the triceratops and I also loved it 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.910
 the tyrannosaurus rex and the fleshy bus already 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.740
 which is a species that is one of the 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.720
 bigger and also more dangerous 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.030
 but on this journey through the world of 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.030
 dinosaurs we assure you that not only 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.280

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.130
 broad 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.010
 I imagine or we go back to 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.770
 years of how it will have been is beautiful of 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.600
 true for the size of his hands 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.760
 that they had so small this was very 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.770
 well actually very small is very 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.420
 small and I tell you how they grabbed 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.700
 to a certain object but if that does not 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.040
 surprised wait to see the end of 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:52.739
