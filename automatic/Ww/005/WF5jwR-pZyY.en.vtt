00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.600
 let's create a countdown application that events like this wish on behalf of 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.190
 national instruments 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.440
 nearly 16 minutes of a 32-bit counter and can compare rates up to 5 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.549
 megabits 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:15.509
 let's take a look at the radio we have here 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.039
 I have a switch 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.050
 connected to the buyer's entrance 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.750
 The track switch is also connected to the ground terminal of 6 mi. 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:25.529
 v 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.340
 and when I turn on the switch let's wait for a downhill 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:33.350
 to record these events with a counter 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.040
 so let's go to the ship that our graphical programming language 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.620
 used to configure data acquisition applications 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.600
 it makes it easy to develop simple applications and can expand 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.060
 for complex applications 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.870
 the first thing we're going to do on the front panel is to create a 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.860
 numeric 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.090
 let's resize it 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.830
 to make it 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.090
 best 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.090
 your viewing 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.890
 it will show the events accumulated over time 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.500
 and so getting years stopped front 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.890
 Fire, let's go show 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.620
 block diadem 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.260
 here we will add 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.150
 the purchasing assistant 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.330
 in case 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.110
 walk that assistant 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.540
 We will practice vicinal 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.910
 I will tell events 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.960
 will have borders 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.360
 and simply choose the buyer that is available on this device 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.840
 in case we are going to show it 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.420
 complement 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.760
 let's click 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.960
 in hockenheim 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.960
 and our task of telling you that it's set up 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.140
 the sent lead suggested using with a repeat structure 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.830
 so that the executive program on an ongoing basis 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.760
 the answer is yes 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.019
 Let's put our numerical indicator 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.019
 within the repetition structure 

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:15.629
 I congratulate to 10 years the exit of the accountant 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.259
 while the program run 

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:21.989
 our count output that will be connected to the indicator 

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:28.039
 at this moment our program is ready to run 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.979
 let's go back to the front panel 

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:35.199
 and let's run the program 

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:38.709
 I'm going to start generating events with a lot of rock tour 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.459
 occasionally you can see jumps in the count 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:47.219
 this is due to the construction of the switch 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.769
 Who does not have bbb servers 11 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:56.139
 and as the name of our accountant is able to read up to a range of 5 megapixels 

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:58.389
 this interlocutor salt 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:03.180
 because it is the triggering noise of the switch and accumulates these events 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.059
 if you had an author you would be able to appearances from a code 

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:12.609
 digital and determines values ​​such as drop and pm of this motors 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:16.849
 but for applications like this we recommend the timers that 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.409
 equip series products m 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:24.709
 this was an example of event counting application using usb 6min 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:25.790
 9 and olé Brazil
