at<00:04:42.220> this<00:04:42.520> point<00:04:42.790> we<00:04:43.120> reintroduce<00:04:43.780> the<00:04:43.930> roller

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
at this point we reintroduce the roller

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.170 
at this point we reintroduce the roller
and<00:04:44.590> use<00:04:44.890> this<00:04:45.040> to<00:04:45.190> help<00:04:45.370> remove<00:04:45.670> the<00:04:45.850> second

depending<00:05:29.030> on<00:05:29.120> operator<00:05:29.600> preference<00:05:30.370> then<00:05:31.370> we

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
depending on operator preference then we

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.460 
depending on operator preference then we
place<00:05:31.760> the<00:05:31.970> dynamic<00:05:32.450> lead<00:05:32.600> depressor<00:05:33.020> next<00:05:33.410> to
