pieces of apparatus now the problem with

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.020 
pieces of apparatus now the problem with
this<00:01:14.810> kind<00:01:15.049> of<00:01:15.110> setup<00:01:15.380> is<00:01:15.740> it<00:01:16.670> can<00:01:16.850> become

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
this kind of setup is it can become

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.910 
this kind of setup is it can become
quite<00:01:17.420> frayed<00:01:17.810> and<00:01:18.049> deteriorate<00:01:18.650> over<00:01:18.680> time
