Hello, everybody!

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.500
Today we'll examine this
Cort Earth200 acoustic guitar.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.500
The body top of this guitar is made of spruce,

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.000
the back is made of solid redwood,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
sides and neck are made of redwood too

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and the fretboard is of rosewood.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.000
This guitar has Grover tuners, which is very nice.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.000
Let's listen to the sound
of this remarkable instrument.
