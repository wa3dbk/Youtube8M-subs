00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
going to his right so if he has the ball

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.990

hand<00:02:40.329> a<00:02:40.450> little<00:02:40.570> bit<00:02:40.720> and<00:02:41.079> on<00:02:41.590> occasion<00:02:42.220> I<00:02:42.870> can

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
hand a little bit and on occasion I can

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.080 
hand a little bit and on occasion I can
guess<00:02:44.200> but<00:02:44.500> he's<00:02:44.650> going<00:02:44.769> to<00:02:44.890> go<00:02:45.370> really<00:02:45.730> hard

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
guess but he's going to go really hard

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.940 
guess but he's going to go really hard
to<00:02:46.269> the<00:02:46.359> right<00:02:46.600> and<00:02:46.870> I'm<00:02:47.200> going<00:02:47.380> to<00:02:47.440> step<00:02:47.709> in

and beat him to the spot and hopefully
if<00:02:51.519> I<00:02:51.609> guess<00:02:51.850> right<00:02:52.120> because<00:02:52.930> he's<00:02:53.109> square<00:02:53.410> in

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
if I guess right because he's square in
