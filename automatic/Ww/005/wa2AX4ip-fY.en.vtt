00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.559 
tool box for only three dollars stay
tuned<00:00:04.589> and<00:00:04.859> I'll<00:00:05.009> show<00:00:05.040> you<00:00:05.279> how<00:00:05.460> for<00:00:06.450> this

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
tuned and I'll show you how for this

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.450 
tuned and I'll show you how for this
project<00:00:06.839> I'm<00:00:07.230> using<00:00:07.259> some<00:00:07.740> pine<00:00:08.099> that<00:00:08.400> I

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
project I'm using some pine that I

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.370 
project I'm using some pine that I
picked<00:00:08.730> up<00:00:08.849> bed<00:00:09.059> of<00:00:09.240> my<00:00:09.389> local<00:00:09.570> lumber<00:00:10.110> store

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
picked up bed of my local lumber store

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.610 
picked up bed of my local lumber store
and<00:00:10.650> it<00:00:11.190> was<00:00:11.340> marked<00:00:11.759> down<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:12.030> 70%<00:00:12.509> so<00:00:13.469> these

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
and it was marked down to 70% so these

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.530 
and it was marked down to 70% so these
would<00:00:13.889> originally<00:00:14.460> be<00:00:14.580> ten<00:00:14.910> dollars<00:00:15.089> total

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
would originally be ten dollars total

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.920 
would originally be ten dollars total
instead<00:00:16.529> I<00:00:16.560> got<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:16.890> $3.00<00:00:17.789> total<00:00:18.180> so<00:00:18.630> this<00:00:18.660> is

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
instead I got a $3.00 total so this is

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.050 
instead I got a $3.00 total so this is
really<00:00:19.140> cheap<00:00:19.529> yeah<00:00:20.130> they<00:00:20.369> do<00:00:20.430> have<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.760> few

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
really cheap yeah they do have a few

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.509 
really cheap yeah they do have a few
cracks<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:21.869> would<00:00:21.990> stuff<00:00:22.260> but<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:23.100> can<00:00:23.340> work

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
cracks and it would stuff but I can work

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.970 
cracks and it would stuff but I can work
around<00:00:23.699> that<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.449> this<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.230> great<00:00:25.769> way<00:00:25.949> to

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
around that so this is a great way to

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.710 
around that so this is a great way to
pick<00:00:26.250> up<00:00:26.369> some<00:00:26.580> wood<00:00:26.849> I<00:00:27.090> mean<00:00:27.269> they<00:00:27.390> mark<00:00:27.599> it

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
pick up some wood I mean they mark it

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.080 
pick up some wood I mean they mark it
down<00:00:27.779> really<00:00:28.289> cheap<00:00:28.619> I'm<00:00:29.460> going<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.699> start<00:00:29.970> by

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
down really cheap I'm going to start by

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.089 
down really cheap I'm going to start by
ripping<00:00:30.330> one<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.630> my<00:00:30.810> 4-foot<00:00:31.349> boards<00:00:31.679> down<00:00:31.890> to

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
ripping one of my 4-foot boards down to

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:58.820 
ripping one of my 4-foot boards down to
eight<00:00:32.250> inches<00:00:32.640> wide

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:58.830 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.500 

so<00:00:59.830> now<00:01:00.040> I<00:01:00.070> have<00:01:00.310> the<00:01:00.460> bottom<00:01:00.790> of<00:01:00.880> the<00:01:00.940> box<00:01:01.180> in

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
so now I have the bottom of the box in

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.860 
so now I have the bottom of the box in
the<00:01:01.780> two<00:01:01.990> side<00:01:02.350> pieces<00:01:02.740> now<00:01:03.520> this<00:01:04.330> looks<00:01:04.690> a

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870 
the two side pieces now this looks a

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.800 
the two side pieces now this looks a
little<00:01:05.080> bit<00:01:05.350> clunky<00:01:05.860> so<00:01:06.760> basically<00:01:07.120> I<00:01:07.240> marked

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
little bit clunky so basically I marked

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.370 
little bit clunky so basically I marked
a<00:01:08.080> up<00:01:08.530> five<00:01:08.980> inches<00:01:09.430> and<00:01:09.760> I<00:01:09.790> did<00:01:09.970> a<00:01:10.030> 45<00:01:10.540> over<00:01:10.960> and

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
a up five inches and I did a 45 over and

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.160 
a up five inches and I did a 45 over and
I<00:01:11.410> did<00:01:11.650> the<00:01:11.770> same<00:01:12.040> on<00:01:12.340> the<00:01:13.060> other<00:01:13.090> board<00:01:13.630> and

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
I did the same on the other board and

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.750 
I did the same on the other board and
basically<00:01:14.650> I'm<00:01:14.800> going<00:01:14.890> to<00:01:14.950> trim<00:01:15.280> off<00:01:15.310> these

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
basically I'm going to trim off these

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.130 
basically I'm going to trim off these
and<00:01:16.090> it's<00:01:16.210> going<00:01:16.360> to<00:01:16.420> kind<00:01:16.570> of<00:01:16.690> give<00:01:16.840> it<00:01:16.960> a

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
and it's going to kind of give it a

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:46.350 
and it's going to kind of give it a
nicer<00:01:17.560> look

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.940 

so<00:01:47.360> it's<00:01:47.510> looking<00:01:47.750> pretty<00:01:47.900> good<00:01:48.020> so<00:01:48.380> far<00:01:48.680> and

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
so it's looking pretty good so far and

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.920 
so it's looking pretty good so far and
on<00:01:49.220> the<00:01:49.340> inside<00:01:49.790> I<00:01:49.820> have<00:01:50.180> the<00:01:50.300> parts<00:01:50.690> where<00:01:50.900> I

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
on the inside I have the parts where I

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.050 
on the inside I have the parts where I
stopped<00:01:51.440> the<00:01:51.740> round<00:01:51.980> over<00:01:52.280> I<00:01:52.370> didn't<00:01:52.790> go<00:01:52.880> down

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
stopped the round over I didn't go down

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.330 
stopped the round over I didn't go down
right<00:01:53.360> here<00:01:53.690> that's<00:01:54.260> basically<00:01:54.770> so<00:01:55.100> when<00:01:55.310> I

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
right here that's basically so when I

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.820 
right here that's basically so when I
add<00:01:55.610> a<00:01:55.640> side<00:01:56.060> piece<00:01:56.390> here<00:01:56.810> it's<00:01:57.560> a<00:01:57.620> nice

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
add a side piece here it's a nice

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.430 
add a side piece here it's a nice
transition<00:01:58.190> to<00:01:58.820> the<00:01:58.940> top<00:01:59.180> round<00:01:59.450> over<00:01:59.870> but<00:02:00.410> I

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
transition to the top round over but I

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.230 
transition to the top round over but I
obviously<00:02:00.680> have<00:02:01.100> to<00:02:01.190> cut<00:02:01.370> this<00:02:01.520> will<00:02:02.090> be<00:02:02.210> a

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
obviously have to cut this will be a

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.000 
obviously have to cut this will be a
nice<00:02:02.480> transition<00:02:03.080> instead<00:02:03.620> I'm<00:02:03.710> just<00:02:03.740> going

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
nice transition instead I'm just going

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.310 
nice transition instead I'm just going
straight<00:02:04.250> down<00:02:04.430> and<00:02:05.120> it<00:02:05.300> will<00:02:05.360> make<00:02:05.570> a<00:02:05.600> gap<00:02:06.080> on

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
straight down and it will make a gap on

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.590 
straight down and it will make a gap on
the<00:02:06.380> board<00:02:06.770> so<00:02:07.310> you'll<00:02:07.670> see<00:02:07.850> that<00:02:08.030> at<00:02:08.240> the<00:02:08.390> end

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
the board so you'll see that at the end

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.450 
the board so you'll see that at the end
of<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.780> video<00:02:09.050> but<00:02:09.920> I'm<00:02:10.100> going<00:02:10.130> to<00:02:10.280> go<00:02:10.369> ahead

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
of the video but I'm going to go ahead

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.210 
of the video but I'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:10.759> cut<00:02:10.970> a<00:02:11.240> four<00:02:11.690> and<00:02:12.050> a<00:02:12.290> quarter<00:02:12.590> inch<00:02:12.920> piece

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
and cut a four and a quarter inch piece

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.400 
and cut a four and a quarter inch piece
here<00:02:13.790> and<00:02:13.970> it's<00:02:14.330> going<00:02:14.480> to<00:02:14.540> be<00:02:14.690> a<00:02:14.720> foot<00:02:15.230> and<00:02:15.380> a

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
here and it's going to be a foot and a

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.980 
here and it's going to be a foot and a
half<00:02:15.440> long<00:02:15.860> and<00:02:16.370> this<00:02:16.790> this<00:02:17.360> is<00:02:17.570> just<00:02:17.780> going<00:02:17.930> to

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
half long and this this is just going to

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.840 
half long and this this is just going to
make<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.260> rail<00:02:18.500> so<00:02:19.010> I<00:02:19.040> need<00:02:19.220> to<00:02:19.340> make<00:02:19.520> two<00:02:19.820> of

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
make the rail so I need to make two of

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:59.449 
make the rail so I need to make two of
these<00:02:20.120> then<00:02:20.690> I'll<00:02:20.840> start<00:02:21.200> work<00:02:21.440> on<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:21.800> handle

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.820 

so<00:03:00.459> I<00:03:00.489> went<00:03:00.849> ahead<00:03:00.970> and<00:03:01.180> I<00:03:01.629> cut<00:03:01.900> my<00:03:02.110> dowel<00:03:02.349> and

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
so I went ahead and I cut my dowel and

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.160 
so I went ahead and I cut my dowel and
I'm<00:03:03.400> just<00:03:03.670> going<00:03:03.819> to<00:03:03.910> go<00:03:04.030> ahead<00:03:04.209> and<00:03:04.450> do<00:03:04.569> a<00:03:04.599> dry

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
I'm just going to go ahead and do a dry

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:11.970 
I'm just going to go ahead and do a dry
test-fit<00:03:06.160> and<00:03:06.970> basically<00:03:10.260> I'm<00:03:11.260> gonna<00:03:11.530> see<00:03:11.830> how

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
test-fit and basically I'm gonna see how

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:18.000 
test-fit and basically I'm gonna see how
well<00:03:12.160> it's<00:03:12.550> together

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.270 

and<00:03:18.489> that<00:03:18.909> is<00:03:19.120> a<00:03:19.450> toolbox<00:03:20.080> right<00:03:20.379> there<00:03:20.590> so

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
and that is a toolbox right there so

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.860 
and that is a toolbox right there so
basically<00:03:21.580> what<00:03:22.060> I'm<00:03:22.150> going<00:03:22.209> to<00:03:22.299> go<00:03:22.510> ahead<00:03:22.599> and

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
basically what I'm going to go ahead and

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.750 
basically what I'm going to go ahead and
do<00:03:23.019> now<00:03:23.200> is<00:03:23.409> I'm<00:03:23.830> going<00:03:23.950> to<00:03:24.069> round<00:03:24.280> over<00:03:24.730> the

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
do now is I'm going to round over the

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.570 
do now is I'm going to round over the
outside<00:03:25.420> edge<00:03:25.690> of<00:03:25.930> this<00:03:26.200> only<00:03:26.500> and<00:03:27.190> I'm<00:03:27.430> going

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
outside edge of this only and I'm going

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.940 
outside edge of this only and I'm going
to<00:03:27.640> do<00:03:27.790> that<00:03:27.940> on<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.209> other<00:03:28.330> side<00:03:28.500> I'm<00:03:29.500> making

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
to do that on the other side I'm making

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.830 
to do that on the other side I'm making
the<00:03:30.069> inside<00:03:30.430> but<00:03:30.790> I<00:03:30.849> think<00:03:31.239> I'm<00:03:31.330> only<00:03:31.510> going<00:03:31.750> to

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
the inside but I think I'm only going to

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.789 
the inside but I think I'm only going to
do<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.049> outside

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
do the outside

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.369 
do the outside
I'll<00:03:33.069> give<00:03:33.370> it<00:03:33.400> a<00:03:33.580> sanding<00:03:34.209> then<00:03:34.870> from<00:03:35.110> there<00:03:35.349> I

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:35.379 
I'll give it a sanding then from there I

00:03:35.379 --> 00:04:39.540 
I'll give it a sanding then from there I
can<00:03:35.709> go<00:03:35.860> ahead<00:03:35.950> and<00:03:36.400> assemble<00:03:37.030> it

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.250 

so<00:04:40.550> I<00:04:40.580> think<00:04:40.700> it<00:04:40.970> came<00:04:41.120> out<00:04:41.270> pretty<00:04:41.330> good<00:04:41.870> I

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
so I think it came out pretty good I

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.320 
so I think it came out pretty good I
mean<00:04:42.470> all<00:04:42.770> the<00:04:42.950> gaps<00:04:43.190> on<00:04:43.550> it<00:04:43.700> are<00:04:43.850> really<00:04:44.120> nice

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
mean all the gaps on it are really nice

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.780 
mean all the gaps on it are really nice
and<00:04:44.540> tight<00:04:44.840> the<00:04:45.560> round<00:04:45.830> over<00:04:46.220> really<00:04:46.550> made<00:04:46.760> a

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
and tight the round over really made a

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.330 
and tight the round over really made a
nice<00:04:47.120> like<00:04:47.600> a<00:04:47.960> nice<00:04:48.410> feel<00:04:48.740> part<00:04:49.160> and

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
nice like a nice feel part and

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.490 
nice like a nice feel part and
everything<00:04:49.790> round<00:04:50.180> overs<00:04:50.570> on<00:04:50.810> the<00:04:50.900> inside<00:04:51.290> you

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
everything round overs on the inside you

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.220 
everything round overs on the inside you
know<00:04:51.650> no<00:04:52.190> sharp<00:04:52.490> corners<00:04:52.940> or<00:04:53.120> anything<00:04:53.270> the

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
know no sharp corners or anything the

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.520 
know no sharp corners or anything the
cutouts<00:04:54.890> on<00:04:55.160> here<00:04:55.670> look<00:04:55.970> really<00:04:56.240> good<00:04:56.450> and<00:04:56.780> I

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
cutouts on here look really good and I

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:58.840 
cutouts on here look really good and I
think<00:04:57.590> it<00:04:57.890> just<00:04:58.040> came<00:04:58.190> out<00:04:58.340> really<00:04:58.610> good

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
think it just came out really good

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:59.680 
think it just came out really good
overall

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
overall

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.350 
overall
I<00:04:59.720> didn't<00:05:00.410> glue<00:05:00.590> the<00:05:00.770> handle<00:05:01.190> in<00:05:01.370> so<00:05:01.820> it<00:05:02.000> can

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
I didn't glue the handle in so it can

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.930 
I didn't glue the handle in so it can
rotate<00:05:02.750> a<00:05:03.080> little<00:05:03.200> if<00:05:03.650> you<00:05:04.100> want<00:05:04.340> it<00:05:04.460> to<00:05:04.640> that

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
rotate a little if you want it to that

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.480 
rotate a little if you want it to that
way<00:05:05.090> you<00:05:05.150> can<00:05:05.300> kind<00:05:05.480> of<00:05:05.570> swing<00:05:05.900> it<00:05:06.170> or<00:05:06.590> what<00:05:07.340> you

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
way you can kind of swing it or what you

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.190 
way you can kind of swing it or what you
could<00:05:07.700> do<00:05:07.820> is<00:05:07.940> glue<00:05:08.210> it<00:05:08.270> in<00:05:08.450> then<00:05:08.780> you<00:05:08.900> can<00:05:09.050> just

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
could do is glue it in then you can just

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.890 
could do is glue it in then you can just
like<00:05:09.440> have<00:05:09.680> it<00:05:09.800> stay<00:05:10.190> there<00:05:10.370> solid<00:05:10.910> but<00:05:11.600> I<00:05:11.630> did

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
like have it stay there solid but I did

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.300 
like have it stay there solid but I did
think<00:05:12.140> it<00:05:12.170> came<00:05:12.380> out<00:05:12.530> really<00:05:12.710> good<00:05:12.830> and<00:05:13.220> I<00:05:15.310> just

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
think it came out really good and I just

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.680 
think it came out really good and I just
liked<00:05:16.460> it<00:05:16.490> a<00:05:16.640> lot<00:05:16.790> so<00:05:17.060> I'm<00:05:17.270> going<00:05:17.450> to<00:05:17.480> go<00:05:17.600> ahead

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
liked it a lot so I'm going to go ahead

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.560 
liked it a lot so I'm going to go ahead
now<00:05:17.900> and<00:05:18.350> put<00:05:18.590> all<00:05:19.130> my<00:05:19.310> screwdrivers<00:05:20.150> in<00:05:20.180> here

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
now and put all my screwdrivers in here

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.300 
now and put all my screwdrivers in here
and<00:05:20.960> get<00:05:21.200> rid<00:05:21.320> of<00:05:21.440> that<00:05:21.530> Tupperware<00:05:22.130> bin

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
and get rid of that Tupperware bin

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:37.000 
and get rid of that Tupperware bin
finally<00:05:34.810> so<00:05:35.810> that<00:05:35.990> gives<00:05:36.230> me<00:05:36.320> plenty<00:05:36.770> of<00:05:36.950> room

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010 
finally so that gives me plenty of room

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.430 
finally so that gives me plenty of room
for<00:05:37.370> all<00:05:37.430> my<00:05:37.480> screwdrivers<00:05:38.480> it's<00:05:38.990> really<00:05:39.260> easy

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
for all my screwdrivers it's really easy

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.100 
for all my screwdrivers it's really easy
to<00:05:39.590> carry<00:05:39.980> around<00:05:40.180> and<00:05:41.180> now<00:05:41.600> it<00:05:41.750> just<00:05:41.780> looks

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
to carry around and now it just looks

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.130 
to carry around and now it just looks
like<00:05:42.200> anything<00:05:42.620> makes<00:05:42.890> more<00:05:43.160> shelf<00:05:43.460> space<00:05:44.140> so

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140 
like anything makes more shelf space so

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.840 
like anything makes more shelf space so
let's<00:05:45.320> keep<00:05:45.470> on<00:05:45.650> really<00:05:45.950> good<00:05:46.190> and<00:05:46.520> it<00:05:46.700> has
