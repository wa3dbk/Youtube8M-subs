00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.180
 how about youtube users here 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:36.540
 He speaks for 19 good this time 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.940
 I bring you an excellent tutorial for 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.690
 many those who want to have a 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.629
 skin like this in your nexus top bar 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.420
 good agreement since I've seen in several 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.850
 channels or in some youtube videos 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.309
 that some users are left 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.670
 some skins for what this bar 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.190
 nexus but very badly edited or very badly 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.860
 facts and also good there are others 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.500
 users that give good skins like 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.050
 but they give them in a rare folder 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.200
 compass and they ask the users that 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:13.259
 forcibly comment on your video and vote 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.360
 necessarily for his video but from the 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.119
 password to download the 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.860
 good skins this time is 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.970
 teaching in some way to be able 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.610
 create them or edit them and be able to place them 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:30.880
 correctly any corner be 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.460
 overthrown or project in your bar next 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.060
 very easily according to a 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.520
 very simple trick 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.090
 good to start obviously we are going to 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.549
 open our bar 2 that would be the nexus 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.200
 we go here to the control panel we give 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.510
 right in the option that says 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.460
 preferences 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.350
 now I'm going to show you some topics 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.900
 that I have placed here on my bar for 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.970
 that they see that it works properly 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.460
 I'm going to observe all these issues are 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:04.400
 mine can not be shown 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.260
 let's see for example from here 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.190
 As you can see here, these are the 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.630
 excellent system 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.630
 for example from here 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.990
 among others I remember there are many but 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.390
 many topics that you are also going 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.490
 to be able to place very easily for 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.890
 start let's download a skin 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.310
 Roque top in my case I already have it 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.310
 here 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.090
 well here come 7 a written me 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.090
 downloaded from the object 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:42.080
 as you can see and its pilgrims 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.080
 is the latin type of eagle 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.390
 good to start or mozart click 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.300
 right to any skin you want 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.160
 We put him in the nexus bar will 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.310
 leave us the option that says add to 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.500
 archive 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.660
 and in this part of here the 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.690
 trick that is really simple but 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:05.040
 very useful we are going to erase the part that 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:09.209
 says to close this part of that weird point 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:12.719
 and we are going to put you sip point in agreement 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:15.450
 points and in another case they simply mark 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:18.000
 this option and we simply give in 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.989
 accept the agreement should not be rap point 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.550
 but points and we will accept and 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:27.260
 ready the style will be created 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.540
 how can you observe like this is 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.269
 simply changing from weird point to 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:37.380
 points and now we're just going to 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:39.680
 what is our mixed bar here 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.970
 we turn to the option that says themes 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.990
 and we simply give in the option 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.900
 to import 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:51.130
 we look at the desk to observe 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:53.980
 points and do not forget we will open it to 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.830
 bring decompression information and 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.050
 we accept it so it is and now 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:03.550
 we simply look for the skin according to the 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:05.710
 name that would be abstract white 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.870
 that would be the one here as they can 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.700
 observe the skin is now placed 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.700
 we simply apply 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:17.359
 and as you can see, it's simple 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.919
 has placed the skin according to what I am going to 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.730
 change to another wallpaper so that what 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:24.540
 can see much better 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.540
 let's see 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.600
 with life from here 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.570
 that you can notice a little more education 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.880
 skin as you can see here is 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.830
 perfectly placed if what they want 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.260
 is to change the width a bit or that 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.600
 the icons come down with a little more here in 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.090
 this part below simply we 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.010
 we go to the style option once 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.139
 marked we go to option that says 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:51.629
 open folder 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:54.780
 this is in case you want to edit a 

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:57.210
 little part of the height or width of the 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.770
 written in agreement we go to the option 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.319
 which says background that would be this 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.759
 small text file let's give it 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:05.360
 right click and on the option that says 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:05.360
 Edit 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.900
 here we will have the necessary margins 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.300
 to be able to edit the skin the only 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.520
 margins that we are going to move simply 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.610
 would be the option that says button 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.850
 that the last part and the 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:24.580
 also the part that says button margin 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.770
 I remember these two unique options for 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.810
 what is to handle the width of the study 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.150
 good as you can see it works 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.550
 perfectly fine of course in a 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:36.850
 small preview later they will 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.410
 to see much better to agree that 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.300
 it would be all for the moment a great sun to 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.730
 all of you a great greeting to the team 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.670
 dark systems day and best team on youtube 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:47.820
 and we will be seeing each other until the next 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.820
 bye
