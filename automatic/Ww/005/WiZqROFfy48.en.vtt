00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
right here i'm using the machine gun on

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.920 
right here i'm using the machine gun on
the<00:01:08.340> jet<00:01:08.580> i'm<00:01:09.030> going<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.240> talk<00:01:09.390> about<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:09.720> for

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
a little bit because it's very important

to master before you do anything else

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.710 
to master before you do anything else
because<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.909> know<00:01:15.119> that's<00:01:15.270> what<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.479> start

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
because you know that's what you start

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.810 
using it no matter what without you're
using<00:01:19.080> whether<00:01:19.530> it's<00:01:19.830> lock<00:01:20.040> on<00:01:20.250> missiles<00:01:20.670> or

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
gun and it's probably the most reliable

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.390 
gun and it's probably the most reliable
way<00:01:27.450> on<00:01:27.659> taking<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.110> enemy<00:01:28.439> out<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:29.250> when

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.440 
vehicle strafing on how to kill vehicles
basically<00:01:54.610> you<00:01:54.700> have<00:01:54.820> to<00:01:54.880> start<00:01:55.180> out<00:01:55.330> on

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
basically you have to start out on

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.090 
basically you have to start out on
opposite<00:01:55.810> ends<00:01:55.900> the<00:01:56.020> map<00:01:56.200> and<00:01:56.650> then<00:01:56.890> I'm<00:01:56.950> going

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
opposite ends the map and then I'm going

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.910

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
to talk about the unguided missiles on

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.610 
to talk about the unguided missiles on
killing<00:01:59.920> other<00:02:00.100> enemy<00:02:00.490> aircraft<00:02:01.260> but<00:02:02.260> anyway

we're<00:02:03.010> still<00:02:03.220> doing<00:02:03.370> this<00:02:03.670> with<00:02:04.240> the<00:02:04.420> machine

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
we're still doing this with the machine

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.410 
we're still doing this with the machine
guns<00:02:04.990> armed<00:02:05.400> right<00:02:06.400> there<00:02:06.640> i<00:02:06.670> was<00:02:06.880> going<00:02:07.120> past

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
guns armed right there i was going past

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.600 
guns armed right there i was going past
their<00:02:07.630> spawn<00:02:07.960> in<00:02:08.110> their<00:02:08.229> jets<00:02:08.530> and<00:02:08.800> that's<00:02:09.490> a

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
their spawn in their jets and that's a

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.160 
their spawn in their jets and that's a
really<00:02:09.850> good<00:02:10.000> tactic<00:02:10.450> after<00:02:10.750> you<00:02:10.840> kill<00:02:11.050> them

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
really good tactic after you kill them

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.660 
really good tactic after you kill them
to<00:02:11.320> go<00:02:11.470> over<00:02:11.620> there<00:02:11.800> because<00:02:12.250> it's<00:02:12.400> like<00:02:12.490> about

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
to go over there because it's like about

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.120 
to go over there because it's like about
a<00:02:12.700> 30<00:02:13.030> second<00:02:13.450> respawn<00:02:13.870> on<00:02:14.080> jet<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:14.680> then<00:02:15.040> the

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
a 30 second respawn on jet and then the

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.710 
a 30 second respawn on jet and then the
pop<00:02:15.340> up<00:02:15.520> again<00:02:15.670> so<00:02:15.970> when<00:02:16.090> you<00:02:16.150> pop<00:02:16.360> up<00:02:16.570> when

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
always behind the itunes jet responding

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.230 
always behind the itunes jet responding
it's<00:02:26.320> an<00:02:26.410> easy<00:02:26.590> kill<00:02:26.890> once<00:02:27.459> you<00:02:27.610> get<00:02:27.730> like<00:02:27.970> jet

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
it's an easy kill once you get like jet

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.180 
it's an easy kill once you get like jet
control<00:02:28.660> map<00:02:28.900> control<00:02:29.350> with<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.709> jet<00:02:29.920> I

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
control map control with the jet I

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.720 
control map control with the jet I
always<00:02:30.790> go<00:02:31.060> straight<00:02:31.510> there<00:02:32.310> anyway<00:02:33.310> i<00:02:33.340> hate

always go straight there anyway i hate

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.910 
always go straight there anyway i hate
when<00:02:33.760> i<00:02:33.910> get<00:02:34.060> that<00:02:34.180> lock<00:02:34.420> on<00:02:34.630> kill<00:02:34.930> and<00:02:35.200> they

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
when i get that lock on kill and they

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.830 
when i get that lock on kill and they
just<00:02:36.610> get<00:02:36.730> disabled<00:02:37.240> and<00:02:37.360> I<00:02:37.390> don't<00:02:37.570> get<00:02:37.690> the

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
just get disabled and I don't get the

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.820 
just get disabled and I don't get the
actual<00:02:38.200> anything<00:02:38.800> kind<00:02:39.310> of<00:02:39.370> pisses<00:02:39.640> me<00:02:39.790> off

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
anyway I think it's really important to

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.040 
anyway I think it's really important to
know<00:02:43.030> where<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.240> middle<00:02:43.450> of<00:02:43.480> your<00:02:43.600> screen<00:02:43.720> is

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
know where the middle of your screen is

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.240 
know where the middle of your screen is

in<00:02:59.410> that<00:02:59.440> makes<00:02:59.860> your<00:02:59.980> jet<00:03:00.190> go<00:03:00.310> faster<00:03:00.790> so<00:03:01.570> now

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
in that makes your jet go faster so now

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:02.970 
in that makes your jet go faster so now
i'm<00:03:01.810> going<00:03:01.870> to<00:03:02.019> show<00:03:02.140> you<00:03:02.170> guys<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.530> lock<00:03:02.739> on

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
i'm going to show you guys the lock on

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.710 
i'm going to show you guys the lock on
you<00:03:03.400> just<00:03:03.610> have<00:03:03.700> to<00:03:03.760> keep<00:03:03.940> them<00:03:04.090> in<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.300> circle

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
you just have to keep them in the circle

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.120 
you just have to keep them in the circle
and<00:03:04.900> kind<00:03:05.230> of<00:03:05.260> anticipate<00:03:05.800> where<00:03:05.980> they're

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
and kind of anticipate where they're

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.560 
and kind of anticipate where they're
gonna<00:03:06.190> go<00:03:06.310> not<00:03:06.880> all<00:03:07.060> them<00:03:07.269> are<00:03:07.330> going<00:03:07.450> to<00:03:07.510> be

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
gonna go not all them are going to be

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.020 
gonna go not all them are going to be
this<00:03:07.690> easy<00:03:07.930> and<00:03:08.250> sometimes<00:03:09.250> they<00:03:09.670> have<00:03:09.760> flares

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
this easy and sometimes they have flares

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.300 
this easy and sometimes they have flares
