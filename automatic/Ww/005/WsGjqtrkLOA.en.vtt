00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.520 
so because here the edges there it's
sort<00:04:07.739> of<00:04:07.860> getting<00:04:08.610> white<00:04:09.000> there<00:04:09.360> I<00:04:09.690> absolutely

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
sort of getting white there I absolutely

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.460 
sort of getting white there I absolutely
got<00:04:10.799> my<00:04:10.980> timer<00:04:11.280> on<00:04:11.610> so<00:04:11.970> so<00:04:12.150> far<00:04:12.390> I've<00:04:12.720> got<00:04:12.750> 32

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
got my timer on so so far I've got 32

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.870 
got my timer on so so far I've got 32
seconds<00:04:14.030> without<00:04:15.030> you<00:04:15.510> could<00:04:15.690> see<00:04:16.019> the<00:04:16.470> color

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
seconds without you could see the color

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.670 
seconds without you could see the color
is<00:04:17.880> changing<00:04:18.630> when<00:04:18.870> the<00:04:18.989> edge<00:04:19.139> of<00:04:19.410> C<00:04:19.590> is

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
is changing when the edge of C is

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.540 
is changing when the edge of C is
getting<00:04:19.889> whiter<00:04:21.500> so<00:04:22.500> I'd<00:04:22.650> leave<00:04:22.889> it<00:04:22.949> sad<00:04:23.340> to

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
getting whiter so I'd leave it sad to

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.740 
getting whiter so I'd leave it sad to
say<00:04:23.790> about<00:04:24.090> a<00:04:24.150> minute<00:04:24.780> and<00:04:24.900> a<00:04:24.990> half

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
say about a minute and a half

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.030 
say about a minute and a half
so<00:04:27.750> that's<00:04:27.960> a<00:04:28.050> minute<00:04:28.290> and<00:04:28.440> a<00:04:28.470> half<00:04:28.590> now<00:04:28.860> I'll

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
so that's a minute and a half now I'll

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:38.740 
so that's a minute and a half now I'll
turn<00:04:29.250> it<00:04:29.310> over

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750
