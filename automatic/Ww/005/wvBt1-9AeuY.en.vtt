00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
okay I recently purchased this ghost

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.450 
okay I recently purchased this ghost
evil<00:00:04.440> elite<00:00:04.910> 3.5<00:00:05.910> trigger<00:00:06.210> and<00:00:06.919> it<00:00:07.919> prompted

evil elite 3.5 trigger and it prompted

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.070 
evil elite 3.5 trigger and it prompted
me<00:00:08.550> to<00:00:08.610> make<00:00:08.790> this<00:00:08.910> video<00:00:09.210> because<00:00:09.570> I<00:00:09.809> think

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
me to make this video because I think

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.310 
me to make this video because I think
it's<00:00:10.410> a<00:00:10.530> real<00:00:10.889> special<00:00:11.070> connector<00:00:11.730> now<00:00:12.509> on<00:00:12.960> the

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
it's a real special connector now on the

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.959 
it's a real special connector now on the
right<00:00:13.500> hand<00:00:13.530> side<00:00:13.920> you'll<00:00:14.160> have<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.700> ghost

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
right hand side you'll have the ghost

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.680 
right hand side you'll have the ghost
ultimate<00:00:15.509> 3.5<00:00:16.139> trigger<00:00:16.890> connector<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.029> from

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
ultimate 3.5 trigger connector and from

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.480 
ultimate 3.5 trigger connector and from
ghost<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.199> basically<00:00:19.740> if<00:00:19.859> you<00:00:19.949> look<00:00:20.160> at<00:00:20.369> it

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
ghost and basically if you look at it

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.540 
ghost and basically if you look at it
next<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.820> stock<00:00:21.119> connector<00:00:22.430> you're<00:00:23.430> not

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
next to a stock connector you're not

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.250 
next to a stock connector you're not
going<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.789> see<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.029> whole<00:00:24.359> lot<00:00:24.420> of<00:00:24.930> difference

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
going to see a whole lot of difference

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.000 
going to see a whole lot of difference
going<00:00:25.439> on<00:00:25.650> there

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
going on there

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.859 
going on there
basically<00:00:26.670> they<00:00:26.880> put<00:00:26.910> some<00:00:27.300> holes<00:00:27.510> in<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:27.810> and

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
basically they put some holes in it and

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.269 
basically they put some holes in it and
they<00:00:28.019> say<00:00:28.199> that<00:00:28.349> just<00:00:28.529> helps<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.890> debris

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
they say that just helps the debris

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.920 
they say that just helps the debris
flush<00:00:29.789> out<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.300> then<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.289> actual<00:00:32.160> angle<00:00:32.930> that

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
flush out and then the actual angle that

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.680 
flush out and then the actual angle that
the<00:00:34.110> trigger<00:00:34.350> bar<00:00:34.559> rides<00:00:35.370> against<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.059> changed

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
the trigger bar rides against is changed

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.380 
the trigger bar rides against is changed
so<00:00:36.780> here's<00:00:37.680> your<00:00:37.829> trigger<00:00:38.070> bar<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.489> basically

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
so here's your trigger bar and basically

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.040 
so here's your trigger bar and basically
is<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.600> rounded<00:00:40.290> edge<00:00:40.770> right<00:00:41.160> here<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:42.050> it

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
is that rounded edge right here and it

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.750 
is that rounded edge right here and it
would<00:00:43.140> come<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.829> slide<00:00:44.100> against<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.579> and

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
would come and it slide against that and

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.910 
would come and it slide against that and
push<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.090> down<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.570> get<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.960> break<00:00:46.170> well

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
push it down and you get the break well

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.799 
push it down and you get the break well
on<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:47.670> one<00:00:47.850> here<00:00:48.000> they<00:00:48.120> change<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.600> angle

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
on this one here they change that angle

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.709 
on this one here they change that angle
so<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.920> instead<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.820> just<00:00:50.850> being<00:00:51.120> right

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
so that instead of it just being right

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.600 
so that instead of it just being right
in<00:00:51.870> line<00:00:52.079> with<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.350> connector<00:00:53.129> they've

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
in line with the connector they've

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.700 
in line with the connector they've
changed<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.120> like<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.750> by<00:00:55.350> doing<00:00:55.559> that

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
changed it like that and by doing that

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.860 
changed it like that and by doing that
it<00:00:56.250> just<00:00:56.340> makes<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.000> little<00:00:57.149> softer<00:00:57.449> on<00:00:57.719> that

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
it just makes it a little softer on that

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.090 
it just makes it a little softer on that
rig<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.340> bar<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.359> able<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.859> slowly<00:01:01.859> go

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
rig so that the bar is able to slowly go

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.100 
rig so that the bar is able to slowly go
down<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.760> have<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.510> little<00:01:03.780> smoother

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
down and and have a little smoother

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.500 
down and and have a little smoother
break<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.640> also<00:01:05.640> lighten<00:01:06.000> up<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.299> trigger

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
break and also lighten up the trigger

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.969 
break and also lighten up the trigger
pull<00:01:07.130> so<00:01:08.130> what<00:01:08.970> makes<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.360> one<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:09.750> special

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
pull so what makes this one so special

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.130 
pull so what makes this one so special
okay<00:01:10.979> well<00:01:11.610> what's<00:01:12.270> really<00:01:12.450> neat<00:01:12.720> about<00:01:12.750> this

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
okay well what's really neat about this

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.850 
okay well what's really neat about this
is<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:14.100> allows<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.939> one<00:01:15.360> get<00:01:16.320> rid<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.530> all

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
is it allows you to one get rid of all

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.039 
is it allows you to one get rid of all
your<00:01:17.159> over<00:01:17.460> travel<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.030> that's<00:01:18.540> this<00:01:18.780> tab

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
your over travel and that's this tab

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.490 
your over travel and that's this tab
right<00:01:19.229> here<00:01:19.530> this<00:01:19.799> tab<00:01:20.130> actually<00:01:20.430> will<00:01:21.500> hit

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
right here this tab actually will hit

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.749 
right here this tab actually will hit
against<00:01:23.780> this<00:01:24.780> part<00:01:25.140> right<00:01:25.950> here<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:26.610> when

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
against this part right here so when

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.219 
against this part right here so when
it's<00:01:26.790> sliding<00:01:27.299> in<00:01:27.420> there<00:01:27.600> it'll<00:01:27.840> just<00:01:28.080> hit

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
it's sliding in there it'll just hit

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.929 
it's sliding in there it'll just hit
against<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.680> part<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.250> it'll<00:01:29.640> stop<00:01:29.909> the

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
against that part and it'll stop the

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.730 
against that part and it'll stop the
trigger<00:01:30.659> bar<00:01:30.840> from<00:01:31.020> traveling<00:01:31.409> any<00:01:31.530> further

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
trigger bar from traveling any further

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.859 
trigger bar from traveling any further
and<00:01:32.150> that's<00:01:33.150> something<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.509> has<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.810> be

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
and that's something that has to be

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.679 
and that's something that has to be
custom<00:01:34.290> fit<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.860> if<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.700> don't<00:01:35.880> trust

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
custom fit so if you don't trust

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.569 
custom fit so if you don't trust
yourself<00:01:36.840> or<00:01:37.350> don't<00:01:37.950> know<00:01:38.040> how<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.250> do<00:01:38.400> that

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
yourself or don't know how to do that

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.429 
yourself or don't know how to do that
with<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.210> dremel<00:01:39.600> tool<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.960> get<00:01:40.079> that<00:01:40.200> just

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
with a dremel tool and get that just

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.530 
with a dremel tool and get that just
right<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.799> then<00:01:40.920> sand<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.090> get<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.390> nice

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
right and then sand it and get it nice

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.060 
right and then sand it and get it nice
and<00:01:42.570> smooth<00:01:42.990> then<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.560> might<00:01:43.710> want<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.950> have<00:01:44.040> a

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
and smooth then you might want to have a

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.429 
and smooth then you might want to have a
locksmith<00:01:44.729> or<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.570> gunsmith<00:01:46.500> do<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.860> for<00:01:47.040> you

locksmith or a gunsmith do that for you

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.080 
locksmith or a gunsmith do that for you
but<00:01:49.439> what's<00:01:49.950> really<00:01:50.130> interesting<00:01:50.280> about<00:01:50.759> this

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
but what's really interesting about this

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.330 
but what's really interesting about this
is<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.600> there<00:01:52.200> are<00:01:52.380> kits<00:01:52.649> out<00:01:52.829> there<00:01:53.100> where

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
is that there are kits out there where

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.870 
is that there are kits out there where
you<00:01:53.850> have<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:54.000> housing<00:01:54.299> in<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.840> housing<00:01:55.880> that

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
you have a housing in the housing that

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.929 
you have a housing in the housing that
this<00:01:57.119> goes<00:01:57.360> into<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:58.670> adjustable<00:01:59.670> there's<00:01:59.880> a

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
this goes into is adjustable there's a

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.160 
this goes into is adjustable there's a
screw<00:02:00.240> on<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.450> housing<00:02:00.810> where<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.020> can

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
screw on the housing where you can

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.240 
screw on the housing where you can
adjust<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.219> where<00:02:02.399> that<00:02:02.490> screw<00:02:04.250> basically

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
adjust it to where that screw basically

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.800 
adjust it to where that screw basically
is<00:02:05.340> going<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.549> come<00:02:05.759> out<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.180> hit<00:02:06.600> right<00:02:06.780> here

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
is going to come out and hit right here

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.380 
is going to come out and hit right here
and<00:02:07.200> that's<00:02:07.619> going<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.890> do<00:02:08.670> based<00:02:08.940> essentially

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
and that's going to do based essentially

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.729 
and that's going to do based essentially
the<00:02:09.569> same<00:02:09.720> thing<00:02:10.050> where<00:02:10.259> it's<00:02:10.349> going<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.530> keep

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
the same thing where it's going to keep

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.280 
the same thing where it's going to keep
it<00:02:10.890> from<00:02:10.979> getting<00:02:11.160> more<00:02:11.670> over<00:02:11.940> travel<00:02:12.150> but

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
it from getting more over travel but

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.869 
it from getting more over travel but
this<00:02:13.650> is<00:02:13.829> where<00:02:14.010> it's<00:02:14.159> really<00:02:14.219> special

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
this is where it's really special

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.479 
this is where it's really special
because<00:02:15.000> if<00:02:15.269> you<00:02:15.360> look<00:02:15.769> you'll<00:02:16.769> see<00:02:16.860> that<00:02:17.219> if

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
because if you look you'll see that if

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.699 
because if you look you'll see that if
you<00:02:17.579> follow<00:02:17.849> this<00:02:18.030> line<00:02:18.390> this<00:02:18.659> edge<00:02:18.930> up<00:02:19.200> that

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
you follow this line this edge up that

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.490 
you follow this line this edge up that
this<00:02:20.219> slanted<00:02:20.640> face<00:02:20.909> here<00:02:21.359> is<00:02:21.510> forward<00:02:22.319> of

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
this slanted face here is forward of

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.649 
this slanted face here is forward of
that<00:02:22.560> edge<00:02:22.950> now<00:02:23.640> these<00:02:23.879> you<00:02:24.209> follow<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.540> edge

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
that edge now these you follow the edge

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.470 
that edge now these you follow the edge
up<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.109> it<00:02:25.530> just<00:02:26.129> is<00:02:26.340> at<00:02:26.700> that<00:02:26.909> edge<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.359> it

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
up and it just is at that edge and it

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.630 
up and it just is at that edge and it
goes<00:02:27.599> back<00:02:27.840> that<00:02:28.079> way<00:02:28.260> same<00:02:29.010> with<00:02:29.159> this<00:02:29.250> one<00:02:29.310> up

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
goes back that way same with this one up

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.849 
goes back that way same with this one up
on<00:02:29.730> that<00:02:29.819> edge<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.329> square<00:02:30.659> piece<00:02:30.870> on<00:02:31.650> this

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:31.859 
on that edge the square piece on this

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.339 
on that edge the square piece on this
one<00:02:32.099> it's<00:02:32.519> actually<00:02:32.730> overhanging<00:02:33.659> this<00:02:34.140> edge

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
one it's actually overhanging this edge

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.849 
one it's actually overhanging this edge
so<00:02:35.099> what<00:02:35.370> that's<00:02:35.609> doing<00:02:35.939> is<00:02:36.299> it's<00:02:36.959> making<00:02:37.290> it

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:37.859 
so what that's doing is it's making it

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:40.970 
so what that's doing is it's making it
contact<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:39.209> bar<00:02:39.450> here<00:02:39.900> at<00:02:40.439> a<00:02:40.500> different

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
contact the bar here at a different

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.580 
contact the bar here at a different
point<00:02:41.129> and<00:02:41.340> at<00:02:42.299> a<00:02:42.329> different<00:02:42.689> time<00:02:42.900> so<00:02:43.379> what

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
point and at a different time so what

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.759 
point and at a different time so what
it's<00:02:43.709> doing<00:02:43.799> is<00:02:44.540> you're<00:02:45.540> getting<00:02:45.930> a<00:02:46.109> break

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
it's doing is you're getting a break

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.830 
it's doing is you're getting a break
that<00:02:47.040> is<00:02:47.220> further<00:02:47.549> out<00:02:47.790> instead<00:02:48.480> of<00:02:48.540> being

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
that is further out instead of being

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.660 
that is further out instead of being
having<00:02:49.319> to<00:02:49.620> pull<00:02:49.829> the<00:02:49.920> trigger<00:02:50.069> further<00:02:50.430> back

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
having to pull the trigger further back

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.089 
having to pull the trigger further back
so<00:02:50.939> not<00:02:51.540> only<00:02:51.689> are<00:02:51.930> you<00:02:51.989> able<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.379> adjust<00:02:52.889> the

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
so not only are you able to adjust the

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.129 
so not only are you able to adjust the
pre<00:02:53.340> travel<00:02:53.730> out<00:02:53.909> of<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.150> trigger<00:02:54.389> but<00:02:54.989> you're

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:55.139 
pre travel out of the trigger but you're

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:57.199 
pre travel out of the trigger but you're
going<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:55.500> have<00:02:55.739> let<00:02:56.129> or<00:02:56.340> not<00:02:56.639> pretrial<00:02:57.000> but

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
going to have let or not pretrial but

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.520 
going to have let or not pretrial but
adjust<00:02:57.569> the<00:02:57.659> over<00:02:57.959> travel<00:02:58.109> out<00:02:58.409> of<00:02:58.439> the

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
adjust the over travel out of the

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.349 
adjust the over travel out of the
trigger<00:02:58.769> you're<00:02:59.250> going<00:02:59.430> to<00:02:59.519> have<00:02:59.700> less<00:03:00.030> over

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:00.359 
trigger you're going to have less over

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:02.330 
trigger you're going to have less over
travel<00:03:00.599> because<00:03:01.439> you<00:03:01.769> have<00:03:01.889> to<00:03:02.010> pull<00:03:02.189> the

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
travel because you have to pull the

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.599 
travel because you have to pull the
trigger<00:03:02.549> less<00:03:02.970> as<00:03:03.269> well<00:03:03.569> so<00:03:04.470> it's<00:03:05.220> pretty

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
trigger less as well so it's pretty

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.879 
trigger less as well so it's pretty
amazing<00:03:05.819> the<00:03:06.419> break<00:03:06.720> on<00:03:06.959> it<00:03:07.109> is<00:03:07.230> incredibly

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:07.889 
amazing the break on it is incredibly

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:11.300 
amazing the break on it is incredibly
smooth<00:03:08.450> when<00:03:09.450> I<00:03:09.480> put<00:03:09.840> this<00:03:10.739> connector<00:03:11.159> in

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
smooth when I put this connector in

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.210 
smooth when I put this connector in
after<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.239> stock<00:03:12.810> one<00:03:13.019> there<00:03:13.590> really<00:03:13.859> wasn't

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
after the stock one there really wasn't

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.830 
after the stock one there really wasn't
a<00:03:14.340> huge<00:03:14.549> difference<00:03:14.970> I<00:03:15.090> didn't<00:03:15.329> even<00:03:15.569> feel

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
a huge difference I didn't even feel

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.250 
a huge difference I didn't even feel
like<00:03:15.870> it<00:03:16.109> was<00:03:16.200> even<00:03:16.379> worth<00:03:16.590> it<00:03:16.799> and<00:03:17.840> I<00:03:18.840> really

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
like it was even worth it and I really

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.599 
like it was even worth it and I really
didn't<00:03:19.440> even<00:03:19.470> buy<00:03:19.739> anymore<00:03:19.979> these<00:03:20.310> because<00:03:20.519> I

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
didn't even buy anymore these because I

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.189 
didn't even buy anymore these because I
felt<00:03:20.790> like<00:03:20.849> it<00:03:21.060> was<00:03:21.180> just<00:03:21.209> not<00:03:21.750> even<00:03:22.019> anything

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:22.199 
felt like it was just not even anything

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:24.800 
felt like it was just not even anything
special<00:03:22.760> watched<00:03:23.760> a<00:03:23.909> video<00:03:24.150> on<00:03:24.180> this<00:03:24.449> one<00:03:24.659> and

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
special watched a video on this one and

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.199 
special watched a video on this one and
and<00:03:25.019> a<00:03:25.470> few<00:03:26.069> reviews<00:03:26.190> and<00:03:26.639> figured<00:03:26.849> I'd<00:03:26.940> try<00:03:27.150> it

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
and a few reviews and figured I'd try it

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.080 
and a few reviews and figured I'd try it
out<00:03:27.389> and<00:03:27.889> after<00:03:28.889> examining<00:03:29.340> it<00:03:29.489> and<00:03:29.519> using<00:03:29.970> it

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
out and after examining it and using it

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.409 
out and after examining it and using it
and<00:03:30.209> feeling<00:03:30.870> a<00:03:31.049> huge<00:03:31.349> difference<00:03:31.829> I<00:03:32.729> realized

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:33.419 
and feeling a huge difference I realized

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:35.360 
and feeling a huge difference I realized
why<00:03:33.690> that<00:03:33.900> was<00:03:34.079> and<00:03:34.409> those<00:03:35.010> are<00:03:35.159> for<00:03:35.250> those

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
why that was and those are for those

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.490 
why that was and those are for those
reasons<00:03:35.760> I<00:03:35.849> showed<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.269> and<00:03:36.389> it's<00:03:37.019> amazing

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
reasons I showed you and it's amazing

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.170 
reasons I showed you and it's amazing
the<00:03:37.590> trigger<00:03:37.829> feels<00:03:38.250> better<00:03:38.729> than<00:03:38.940> any<00:03:39.120> other

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
the trigger feels better than any other

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.300 
the trigger feels better than any other
trigger<00:03:39.540> I've<00:03:39.599> ever<00:03:39.720> felt<00:03:39.900> so<00:03:40.310> definitely

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
trigger I've ever felt so definitely

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.360
