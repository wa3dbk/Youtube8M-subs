dedicate a power button and even though
it<00:00:52.350> looks<00:00:52.410> like<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.800> has<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.039> power<00:00:53.370> button

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
it looks like it has a power button

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.520 
it looks like it has a power button
right<00:00:53.850> on<00:00:53.969> top<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.390> press<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.629> once<00:00:54.930> it

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
right on top you press it once it

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.040 
right on top you press it once it
doesn't<00:00:55.800> do<00:00:55.890> anything<00:00:56.280> basically<00:00:57.090> when<00:00:57.780> the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
doesn't do anything basically when the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.619 
doesn't do anything basically when the
iphone<00:00:58.500> 4s<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.340> there<00:00:59.520> it<00:01:00.000> will<00:01:00.090> charge<00:01:00.539> the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
iphone 4s is in there it will charge the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.110 
iphone 4s is in there it will charge the
handset<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:02.100> turns<00:01:02.280> on<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.609> case<00:01:02.850> just

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
handset and it turns on the case just

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.369 
handset and it turns on the case just
because<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.420> can<00:01:03.539> see<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.780> LED<00:01:03.899> lights

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
because you can see the LED lights

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.750 
because you can see the LED lights
lighting<00:01:04.680> up<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.460> could<00:01:05.580> have<00:01:05.640> that

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
lighting up so you could have that

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.820 
lighting up so you could have that
vibration<00:01:06.570> feedback<00:01:06.840> but<00:01:07.380> if<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.560> turn<00:01:07.799> it

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
vibration feedback but if you turn it

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.070 
vibration feedback but if you turn it
off<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.400> hold<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.700> down<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:09.090> turns<00:01:09.630> off<00:01:09.810> the

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
off you hold it down it turns off the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.230 
off you hold it down it turns off the
entire<00:01:10.619> case<00:01:10.979> itself<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.520> can<00:01:11.580> tell<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.939> LED

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
entire case itself you can tell the LED

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.390 
entire case itself you can tell the LED
lights<00:01:12.630> are<00:01:12.930> off<00:01:13.200> as<00:01:13.470> well<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.860> it's<00:01:14.310> no

longer charge of the iphone so you'll

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.800
