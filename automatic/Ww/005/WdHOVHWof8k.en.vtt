00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello youtuber how are you today 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.620
 we'll talk about a subject that's already a little worn 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.630
 but I could not stay behind now 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.490
 you know by the title today we'll talk about 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.500
 Adventure time curiosities first 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.480
 season and before they start 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.580
 trolling I want to say that the information 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.130
 said in this video is taken from pages 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.170
 as a wiki and some other fans of 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.090
 Adventure time but I'll try to get 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.340
 the ones that say the least or those that are not mentioned 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.930
 at least I have not seen in other videos 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.539
 I say this for the possible 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.239
 comments that I'm an imbecile that's 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.070
 from wiki to wikipedia etc. but this 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.920
 I do it because I know that a lot of people give 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.710
 lazy to read but let's start with a 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.170
 good time chapter 1 panic at the party 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.940
 of the palace something obvious but fundamental 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.250
 is that they debut a lot of 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.719
 characters in the series as such being 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.670
 the first episode 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.949
 this episode was first called the 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.469
 real promise and then massacre in the 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.260
 palace party originally from 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.760
 enchiridion was going to be the first episode 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.910
 and this the ninth but it was changed 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.320
 drastically the order of the episodes 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.750
 this I understand that only in 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.210
 Latin America when everyone freezes 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.880
 it does not look light blue it looks normal 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.920
 although this may be animation error 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.770
 it's funny that the sweet princess 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.870
 I mentioned to Tarzan a famous character from 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.550
 walt disney because that's supposed to be 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.520
 drawing was before the war of the 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.530
 mushrooms more than a thousand years ago maybe 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.690
 in land of eye they were able to thaw 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.740
 walt disney hahahahaha do not kill me 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.570
 disney 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.240
 this episode has a sequel called 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.220
 from bad to worse is the first time that 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.680
 move the guardians of the real promise 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.350
 Chapter 2 problems in space 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.899
 beautiful originally this was going to be the 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.970
 episode number 15 and not the second in the 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.830
 Latin version of this episode since 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.910
 refers to the lumpy princess and 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.310
 Melissa as men 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:53.009
 If anything, my destiny is to become a 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.229
 lumps or like those two when I see a 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.539
 close-up of marshmallows end no 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.490
 It has a chair and it bounces on its own but when 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:01.619
 talk to the sweet princess yes she has 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.840
 chair currently the English version 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.940
 of this episode is available and 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.310
 free on itunes so run and 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.580
 download it hahahahaha 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.840
 Chapter 3 prisoners of love 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.380
 originally this episode was going to 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.600
 to call 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.490
 know the frozen king this episode 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.950
 it was planned as the fifth episode 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.320
 of the series and not the third who knows 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.000
 that would alter both the order the 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.130
 princess who seems to dwell in this 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.560
 chapter they call princess mora but in 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.750
 the eyes say raspberry princess to the 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.820
 end of the chapter reveals that purpose 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.320
 he pees on the bed or maybe he just went 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.660
 a lie leaves so that the 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.190
 princess is lime do not marry the end 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.610
 princesses apparently were 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.590
 about 23 days locked up and nobody 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.960
 he had worried about them ha ha ha 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.850
 how little the ghost princess could 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.190
 have left from there on your own since 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.960
 can go through solid objects maybe 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.810
 not me because there would be six 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.850
 princesses and I did not want to leave them alone or 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.150
 maybe I just wanted to be popular hahaha 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.850
 ok already chapter 4 trunks first 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.710
 episode with the name of a character 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.320
 the rainbow sticker only had 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.390
 green and blue trunks calls you to 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.730
 the unicorn horses but without horns 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.450
 maybe it's because she still does not know 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.730
 horses 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.910
 this episode has a sequel called 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.370
 the crystals have power chapter 5 the 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.799
 enchiridion first and only chapter 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.049
 which is called the enchiridion ha ha ha ha 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.780
 ha ha ha we do not continue enchiridion 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.760
 it means manual and it comes from the Greek this 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.920
 it's the only episode where they look 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.769
 plentiful amounts of blood when 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.629
 end kills the beast heart in addiction 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.390
 there are many deaths in this episode 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:40.590
 when end kills the dark magician under his 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.769
 layer is not your body 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.049
 this is a reference to star wars 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:48.390
 chapter 6 dancer here it is revealed that 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.640
 end swallowed a computer at the beginning 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.709
 of the episode is seen to make a step 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.900
 from michael jackson while singing the 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.090
 baby song when he stands on the 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.519
 tip of your feet and take a turn though 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.170
 michael jackson did it backwards in 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.660
 Spain is called cantarini in 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.340
 Latin dancer, that is, Spain 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.319
 refers to who sings and in 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.590
 Latin America makes reference to 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:12.959
 dance chapter 7 ricardo lion heart 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.690
 it is revealed that fin knows how to make origami and 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.340
 the sweet princess calls love to end is 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.440
 the first time we see the sweet 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.660
 princess kissing so but only in her 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.970
 imagination is the first time that end 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.099
 It makes jealous ricard I said to the sweet 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.210
 princess who knows that she likes the 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:29.430
 technology 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.289
 and start asking about science 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.270
 advanced which means that the 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:34.680
 technology advanced much more than the 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.139
 current before the war of the 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.000
 mushrooms it is revealed that the ice king 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.789
 he survives without his heart but he 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.919
 weakens a lot although this last one seems 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:45.870
 irrelevant in the sequel because its new 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:49.080
 heart are cartilages and maracas 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.910
 Chapter 8 businessmen is revealed 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.280
 what end do you think the voice of the sweet 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.530
 princess is attractive in an interview 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.720
 pendleton war said that from this 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.310
 episode the writers came up with 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.979
 about the great war of the mushrooms 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.259
 something strange is that these beings have 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:06.630
 humanoid human form and this does not 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:08.580
 seems to intrigue end like susana and 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.229
 good u2 see you here we leave it for today 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.449
 but soon I will follow you with the 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:14.610
 chapters and again clarified that this 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:16.770
 information is taken from the internet but 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.409
 wait soon my theories about the 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.570
 end mom marcelín and simon and so on 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:25.729
 we are in the video below them 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.729
 I send a hug and good luck in everything
