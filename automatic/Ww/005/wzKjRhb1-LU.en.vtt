um<00:02:19.400> not<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:20.750> biggest<00:02:21.110> of<00:02:21.230> spice<00:02:21.500> fan<00:02:21.800> so<00:02:22.100> a<00:02:22.130> bit

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
um not the biggest of spice fan so a bit

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.330 
um not the biggest of spice fan so a bit
of<00:02:22.370> a<00:02:22.520> bit<00:02:23.450> of<00:02:23.540> a<00:02:23.570> childlike<00:02:24.170> attitude<00:02:24.680> to<00:02:25.160> heat

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
of a bit of a childlike attitude to heat

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.490 
of a bit of a childlike attitude to heat
but<00:02:25.550> that<00:02:25.700> is<00:02:25.790> nice<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.600> rice<00:02:26.900> gives<00:02:27.290> it<00:02:27.410> the

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
but that is nice the rice gives it the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.830 
but that is nice the rice gives it the
unique<00:02:27.800> nice<00:02:28.100> texture<00:02:28.610> I<00:02:28.880> didn't<00:02:29.420> I'm<00:02:29.660> not

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
unique nice texture I didn't I'm not

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.750 
unique nice texture I didn't I'm not
sure<00:02:29.959> if<00:02:30.080> I<00:02:30.170> got<00:02:30.320> any<00:02:30.470> beans<00:02:30.709> but<00:02:31.070> flavor<00:02:31.580> the

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
sure if I got any beans but flavor the

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.640 
sure if I got any beans but flavor the
chicken<00:02:31.790> is<00:02:32.209> perhaps<00:02:32.630> slightly<00:02:33.020> lost<00:02:33.380> as<00:02:33.530> well

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
chicken is perhaps slightly lost as well

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.880 
chicken is perhaps slightly lost as well
no<00:02:33.860> but<00:02:33.980> overpowered<00:02:34.430> by<00:02:34.610> a<00:02:34.640> finger<00:02:34.970> yeah<00:02:35.959> ever

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
no but overpowered by a finger yeah ever

a properly and silent get a bit of a bin

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.600 
a properly and silent get a bit of a bin
window<00:02:40.550> beam<00:02:40.989> bit<00:02:41.989> messy<00:02:42.230> it<00:02:43.220> taste<00:02:43.489> like

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
window beam bit messy it taste like

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.880 
window beam bit messy it taste like
white<00:02:43.970> authentic<00:02:44.600> Mexican<00:02:45.110> so<00:02:45.290> really<00:02:45.770> have

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.699 
you on the Mexican I mean take Mexico

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
don't it tastes like off into Mexico it

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:57.220 
don't it tastes like off into Mexico it
does<00:02:54.730> taste<00:02:55.730> like<00:02:55.850> authentic<00:02:56.390> Mexican<00:02:56.870> nice

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
does taste like authentic Mexican nice

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.540 
does taste like authentic Mexican nice
combination<00:02:57.709> of<00:02:57.800> textures<00:02:58.160> you<00:02:58.280> know<00:02:58.400> there

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
combination of textures you know there

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.610 
combination of textures you know there
are<00:02:58.670> downsides<00:02:59.030> as<00:02:59.810> I've<00:02:59.959> said<00:03:00.110> such<00:03:00.350> as<00:03:00.500> the

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
are downsides as I've said such as the

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.860 
are downsides as I've said such as the
chicken<00:03:01.070> is<00:03:01.280> lost<00:03:01.489> a<00:03:01.640> little<00:03:01.850> bit<00:03:02.000> and<00:03:02.300> maybe

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
chicken is lost a little bit and maybe

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:03.970 
chicken is lost a little bit and maybe
the<00:03:03.050> texture<00:03:03.350> of<00:03:03.380> the<00:03:03.470> chicken<00:03:03.500> as<00:03:03.800> well<00:03:03.830> as

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
the texture of the chicken as well as

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.500 
the texture of the chicken as well as
lost<00:03:04.280> probably<00:03:04.760> be<00:03:04.910> really<00:03:05.090> good<00:03:05.150> in<00:03:05.420> the

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
lost probably be really good in the

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.030 
lost probably be really good in the
pulled<00:03:05.750> chicken<00:03:05.840> but<00:03:06.530> really<00:03:06.799> like<00:03:06.920> the

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
pulled chicken but really like the

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.979 
pulled chicken but really like the
strong<00:03:07.280> barbecue<00:03:07.700> flavor<00:03:07.940> it's<00:03:08.690> a<00:03:08.810> good

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
strong barbecue flavor it's a good

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.440 
strong barbecue flavor it's a good
combination<00:03:09.290> of<00:03:09.590> textures<00:03:10.130> the<00:03:10.850> price<00:03:11.060> point

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
combination of textures the price point

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.410 
combination of textures the price point
isn't<00:03:11.660> too<00:03:12.049> bad<00:03:12.410> it's<00:03:12.860> perhaps<00:03:13.070> you<00:03:14.030> know<00:03:14.150> I

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
isn't too bad it's perhaps you know I

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.910 
isn't too bad it's perhaps you know I
suppose<00:03:14.870> that<00:03:15.019> was<00:03:15.110> two<00:03:15.260> people<00:03:15.560> eating<00:03:15.680> it

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
suppose that was two people eating it

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.780 
suppose that was two people eating it
but<00:03:16.040> we've<00:03:16.190> got<00:03:16.310> for<00:03:16.489> it<00:03:16.549> fairly<00:03:16.880> quickly

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.310 

I<00:03:19.820> think<00:03:20.090> it's<00:03:20.209> really<00:03:20.450> good<00:03:20.630> yeah<00:03:21.049> really

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
I think it's really good yeah really

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.750 
I think it's really good yeah really
good<00:03:21.530> to<00:03:21.650> be<00:03:21.739> fair<00:03:21.920> I<00:03:22.100> could<00:03:22.370> definitely<00:03:22.519> get

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
good to be fair I could definitely get

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.070 
good to be fair I could definitely get
through<00:03:22.910> the<00:03:23.000> whole<00:03:23.090> thing<00:03:23.330> like<00:03:23.810> I<00:03:23.840> said

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
through the whole thing like I said

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.479 
through the whole thing like I said
really<00:03:24.320> loved<00:03:24.709> the<00:03:24.890> combination<00:03:25.130> of

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
really loved the combination of

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:26.259 
really loved the combination of
everything<00:03:25.730> together

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
everything together

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.120 
everything together
it<00:03:26.510> just<00:03:26.750> works<00:03:26.959> really<00:03:27.170> well<00:03:27.350> as<00:03:27.650> I<00:03:27.920> suppose

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
it just works really well as I suppose

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.740 
it just works really well as I suppose
any<00:03:28.340> good<00:03:28.580> burrito<00:03:28.850> should<00:03:29.360> it's<00:03:29.660> a

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
any good burrito should it's a

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.570 
any good burrito should it's a
combination<00:03:30.049> of<00:03:30.320> great<00:03:30.530> flavors<00:03:30.950> okay

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
combination of great flavors okay

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.950 
combination of great flavors okay
they're<00:03:31.850> very<00:03:32.030> high<00:03:32.180> fall<00:03:32.420> stars

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:34.960 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:41.370 

what<00:03:35.740> do<00:03:35.830> you<00:03:35.890> give<00:03:36.070> it<00:03:36.100> a<00:03:36.400> low<00:03:36.910> three<00:03:40.380> yeah

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
what do you give it a low three yeah

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.930 
what do you give it a low three yeah
it's<00:03:41.650> good<00:03:41.860> worth<00:03:42.070> checking<00:03:42.400> out<00:03:42.550> definitely
