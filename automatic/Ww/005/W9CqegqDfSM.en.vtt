it's<00:01:54.390> going<00:01:54.570> through<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.930> going<00:01:55.470> through<00:01:55.590> the

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
it's going through the going through the

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.560 
it's going through the going through the
side<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.219> door<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:57.119> hooks<00:01:57.299> into<00:01:57.479> the

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
side of the door and it hooks into the

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.209 
side of the door and it hooks into the
frame<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.020> car<00:01:59.210> this<00:02:00.210> door<00:02:00.450> can<00:02:00.630> only<00:02:01.219> can

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
frame of the car this door can only can

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.490 
frame of the car this door can only can
only<00:02:02.340> go<00:02:02.610> in<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.030> far<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.540> then<00:02:04.229> it's<00:02:04.350> just

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
only go in so far and then it's just

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.840 
only go in so far and then it's just
going<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.680> move<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.920> whole<00:02:05.009> of<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.460> whole<00:02:05.549> car

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
going to move the whole of the whole car

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.910 
going to move the whole of the whole car
over<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:06.360> it's<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.840> it's<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.229> steel<00:02:07.469> bar<00:02:07.680> going

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
over so it's a it's a steel bar going

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.440 
over so it's a it's a steel bar going
through<00:02:08.160> diagonal<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:08.970> then<00:02:09.030> there's<00:02:09.239> two

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
through diagonal and then there's two

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.170 
through diagonal and then there's two
more<00:02:09.629> that<00:02:10.200> go<00:02:10.410> through<00:02:10.679> horizontally

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
more that go through horizontally

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.879 
drop down and go underneath the car
instead<00:02:45.900> of<00:02:45.989> coming<00:02:46.290> into<00:02:46.409> the<00:02:46.560> occupants

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:46.889 
instead of coming into the occupants

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:52.129 
instead of coming into the occupants
laps<00:02:48.709> hoods<00:02:49.709> designed<00:02:50.129> not<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.840> it'll<00:02:51.840> crumple

laps hoods designed not to it'll crumple

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:52.819 
laps hoods designed not to it'll crumple
up<00:02:52.230> like<00:02:52.409> this

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
up like this

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.920 
up like this
so<00:02:53.010> you'll<00:02:53.159> have<00:02:53.280> to<00:02:53.489> seat<00:02:53.730> two<00:02:54.030> sheets<00:02:54.299> of<00:02:54.480> 18

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
so you'll have to seat two sheets of 18

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.180 
so you'll have to seat two sheets of 18
gauge<00:02:55.139> sheet<00:02:55.409> metal<00:02:55.470> in<00:02:55.829> front<00:02:56.040> of<00:02:56.099> your

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
gauge sheet metal in front of your

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.009 
gauge sheet metal in front of your
windshield<00:02:56.459> so<00:02:57.209> anything<00:02:57.540> coming<00:02:57.810> from<00:02:57.900> the

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
windshield so anything coming from the

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.479 
windshield so anything coming from the
other<00:02:58.170> car<00:02:58.409> is<00:02:58.500> gonna<00:02:58.680> go<00:02:58.799> have<00:02:58.920> to<00:02:59.010> go<00:02:59.129> go

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
other car is gonna go have to go go

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.879 
other car is gonna go have to go go
through<00:02:59.700> 32<00:03:00.060> gauge<00:03:00.480> steel<00:03:00.870> to<00:03:01.500> get<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:01.799> the

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:01.889 
through 32 gauge steel to get to the

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.490 
through 32 gauge steel to get to the
occupant<00:03:02.599> actually<00:03:03.599> the<00:03:03.689> windshield<00:03:04.079> is<00:03:04.230> spot

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
occupant actually the windshield is spot

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.379 
occupant actually the windshield is spot
welded<00:03:04.859> to<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.010> frame<00:03:05.099> so<00:03:05.609> in<00:03:05.730> effect<00:03:05.849> its

how hard you slam on the brakes then

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.550 
how hard you slam on the brakes then
they're<00:03:18.269> not<00:03:18.449> gonna<00:03:18.629> lock<00:03:18.810> on<00:03:19.049> they're<00:03:19.440> gonna

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
they're not gonna lock on they're gonna

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.470 
they're not gonna lock on they're gonna
surge<00:03:19.829> 22<00:03:20.310> times<00:03:20.519> a<00:03:20.669> second<00:03:21.060> to<00:03:21.150> keep<00:03:21.329> the

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
wheels from locking up which gives you

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.479 
wheels from locking up which gives you
control<00:03:23.370> you<00:03:23.849> can<00:03:24.000> steer<00:03:24.329> out<00:03:24.569> of<00:03:24.750> a<00:03:24.840> collision

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
control you can steer out of a collision

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.220

now<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.549> thing<00:03:26.849> that<00:03:26.879> Subaru<00:03:27.569> builds<00:03:27.989> in<00:03:28.079> is

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
now the thing that Subaru builds in is

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.589 
now the thing that Subaru builds in is
called<00:03:28.440> passive<00:03:28.919> safety<00:03:29.310> that's<00:03:29.849> 44<00:03:30.329> things

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
called passive safety that's 44 things

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:32.839 
called passive safety that's 44 things
in<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.810> car<00:03:31.019> that<00:03:31.230> actually<00:03:31.519> keep<00:03:32.519> you<00:03:32.669> from

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
in the car that actually keep you from

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:35.000 
in the car that actually keep you from
ever<00:03:33.090> getting<00:03:33.269> into<00:03:33.569> an<00:03:33.810> accident<00:03:33.900> one<00:03:34.889> of

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
ever getting into an accident one of

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.809 
ever getting into an accident one of
which<00:03:35.159> is<00:03:35.419> the<00:03:36.419> the<00:03:37.139> power<00:03:37.319> steering<00:03:37.819> actually

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
which is the the power steering actually

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.759 
which is the the power steering actually
turns<00:03:39.030> off<00:03:39.239> at<00:03:39.389> 25<00:03:39.750> miles<00:03:39.959> an<00:03:40.109> hour<00:03:40.230> and<00:03:40.379> above

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
turns off at 25 miles an hour and above

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.379 
turns off at 25 miles an hour and above
so<00:03:41.220> you're<00:03:41.340> driving<00:03:41.459> with<00:03:41.729> manual<00:03:42.150> steering

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
so you're driving with manual steering

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:43.909 
so you're driving with manual steering
so<00:03:42.900> you<00:03:42.989> can<00:03:43.109> feel<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.290> surface<00:03:43.620> of<00:03:43.709> the<00:03:43.769> road

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:43.919 
so you can feel the surface of the road

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:45.140 
so you can feel the surface of the road
much<00:03:44.159> better<00:03:44.400> through<00:03:44.639> the<00:03:44.669> steering<00:03:44.909> column

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
much better through the steering column

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.830 
much better through the steering column
and<00:03:45.500> again<00:03:46.500> avoid<00:03:46.889> accidents<00:03:47.840> third

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
and again avoid accidents third
