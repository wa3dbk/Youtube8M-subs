 not all classic cars tattoos fashion 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.440
 cinema hairstyles design and especially music 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.570
 this is the rock and roll culture in 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.609
 mexico and today we are going to discover a little 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.609
 more at the rock festival on the vera 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.540
 and 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.680
 and 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.840
 since rock and roll came to 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.390
 mexico with the rock rebels the 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.940
 crazy of the rhythm the black shirts and 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.040
 all those bands that tropical hoisted 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.830
 very stylish what was happening 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.400
 in the USA this genre has had its 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:50.580
 ups and downs but never has and musicians 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.370
 like pachuco jose nicotina los de pardos 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.410
 the sprays and cats the blackjack if the 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.320
 frantic have reinvented the rockabilly 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.129
 in Mexico and the number of fans is the 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.659
 proof that they are doing very well 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.730
 we all placed the scene of 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:07.590
 rockabilly in mexico but the truth is 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.770
 that I did not expect an event of this 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.120
 magnitude that main port what 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.490
 skull 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.500
 this year was great also because there was 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.460
 bands that we fed a lot 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.260
 as from abroad 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.750
 bands are those that show up this 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.280
 year this year are the celta bomber she 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.619
 will and the high rollers student 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.090
 bobcats pachuco jose bands of the 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.360
 angels and las vegas who have traveled 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:34.479
 everyone and that comes as accredits 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.460
 let's say the festival every summer by 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.930
 what do you think has come back with so much 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.409
 strength of rock and roll and all its 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.020
 culture 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.430
 today it's good that he never left, I think 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.140
 that did not go but something happens very 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.810
 important Chicanos the 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.399
 Mexican Americans adopt all the style 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.860
 and as medium they appropriate it 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.869
 when ritchie valens in 56 records the 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.369
 band other than I was doing rock 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.030
 and roll in Spanish was doing a 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.670
 folklore 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.250
 in these times making the revival of 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.080
 rockabilly telling us 10 years ago of 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.400
 the scene in Mexico because I think that 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.770
 this is the result is not the result 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.869
 that maybe there options 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.869
 we do not like them and we return to the challenges 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.990
 besides having an incredible style for 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.470
 get dressed and combed between the band 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:22.940
 rockabilly dancing is fundamental who 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.940
 barbarians what good they do 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.500
 I took advantage of the itinerant hairdresser 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.750
 to make me a hairstyle of the 50s 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.570
 the base of rubber kilos for hair 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.910
 this girl managed to placate my Chinese and I 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.430
 left ready to continue the party now 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.319
 yes with the right style 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.780
 your genres are entering 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:55.450
 this pure rockabilly festival 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:59.230
 rythm'n'blues plus surf 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:04.620
 and if you see it, rock and roll is so 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.620
 popular is part of all of us 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.760
 the rock to the side has also been 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.620
 become a space to which the 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.540
 car collectors come to 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.549
 show off classic models 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.530
 obviously everyone wants to take 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.659
 photos with the most beautiful because 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.040
 combine with their outfits of the 50s and 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:23.620
 The excesses 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.409
 and there's also motorcycle parade some 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.940
 classic and other tuned in very different ways 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:32.040
 original 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.870
 It organizes once a year but rockabilly 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.520
 is everywhere in Mexico and 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.280
 concerts and events there all the time 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.990
 nothing else is something to be aware of 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.990
 the music that you 're not dancing 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.690
 Y
