 Welcome to How To Cook That, I am Ann Rearden 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.069
 Today we are going to make a rainbow loom band cake, with rainbow glaze between the layers 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.530
 and a huge loom band bracelet on the top. For the uninitiated: loom band are small 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.289
 strap that you weave together to make a bracelet and all other creations. 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:24.159
 First you need two quantities of the sponge cake recipe and two quantities 

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:28.749
 make recipes from one of the frosting. The sponge cake and frosting recipes and all videos 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:33.520
 how to make them are all on the website '' howtocookthat.net '' and I will provide a link 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.910
 in the description below the video. Put 2/3 cup of your glaze in 5 different containers 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.140
 and mix your pink color in the first. I use the French here 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.710
 buttercream glaze recipe you can use all the recipes that I have on the website 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.920
 use the one that you like best. I make all pastel colors, 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.030
 if you want them brighter, you can of course add more dye. After that I have 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.810
 orange, yellow, green and blue mixed. 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.729
 Use a cake leveler or a knife to cut your sponge cakes in half and remove the top 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.929
 from one off. 

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:15.189
 Place your first glance on your cake stand and spread the pink glaze over the top, 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:20.869
 close to, but not all the way to the edges so that when you place the next layer on it 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.210
 do not spray everything from the edges. Continue stacking with the other colors. 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.709
 A few weeks ago I made youtube cupcakes with all your favorite youtubers on it 

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:34.009
 and some asked if I could do something like that with apps. And I thought that is 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.749
 a super good idea. So let me know your favorite apps in the comments, that could be games, 

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:43.429
 photo &amp; videos, lifestyle, productivity which apps you like the most. 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:47.649
 Now cover the whole thing with a thin layer of uncoloured glaze. This thin layer 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.189
 catches all crumbles and that is why it is called the crumb layer. When everything is covered, place 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:53.969
 him in the fridge to take off. 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:58.649
 While it is in the fridge we can make our loom bands. Grab a snake lollipop and cut 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.869
 his mouth so that he opens. Then cut two pieces off the tail or make one 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.590
 point remains. Heat this with a burner and 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.200
 make sure the snake bites its own tail. Squeeze it well and then let it cool. 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.850
 If you do not have a burner you can also light a candle and put it over the top 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.090
 keep the flame, don't keep it in the flame or it will turn black. 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.640
 Make a lot of this in whatever color you like. 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.130
 Then we are ready to make our huge edible loom band bracelet. 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.640
 Take two of your straps, crush them with the start, the snake head, in the middle and 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.710
 then place one on top of the other to make a cross. Fold the bottom double so that 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:45.320
 it wrapped the yellow. Then take a red band and find the head again 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.340
 crush it so that it is in the middle and thread it through the orange loops 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.230
 strap. Fold over the endings of the red one 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.090
 make the loops for the next piece. You can see that we are starting to make a woven pattern. 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.900
 Continue to do this, for those who are not sure what I have just done I will show a few more. 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.410
 So crush the circle and thread it through the loops of the previous one, straighten it 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.740
 and fold it in half to make the loops for the next one. 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.560
 When you are happy with the length, we have to bring them together. Normally you have 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.180
 a plastic clip but we are going to use a different hose. 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.210
 So place through the loops of all and make a loop all around so that it is nice and 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:33.690
 is neat and trim it. Use your burner again to heat and melt the ends together. 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.400
 You can give this as a present to your friends as he is now, but we 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.830
 are now going to use it for our cake. Take the cake from the fridge and cover 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.890
 again with a low glaze. Use your spatula to make it smooth. 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:52.500
 Place your loom bracelet on the upper edge and place the overie straps around the edge. And for it 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.560
 to make it look more beautiful, add a smartie everywhere and then a mini M&amp;M, in the matching color. 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.490
 Then you can cut the bracelet with sharp, clean scissors and of course 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.960
 use a knife to cut the rest of the cake and reveal these beautiful layers of colors. 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.960
