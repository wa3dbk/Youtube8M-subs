00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
this to the battery and we'll see what

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.469 
this to the battery and we'll see what
happens<00:02:02.630> should<00:02:02.899> fire<00:02:03.170> up<00:02:03.200> and<00:02:04.119> hopefully<00:02:05.119> not

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
happens should fire up and hopefully not

00:02:05.479 --> 00:03:47.000 
happens should fire up and hopefully not
