00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.210
 hello my name is jeanne little I 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.710
 am creative clock but today 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.589
 I want to show you how 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:14.530
 write on the walls the idea is to 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:16.240
 to be able to write what you want about 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.490
 walls but not just how 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.660
 so we will choose the sentence we have 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.180
 want to write 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.929
 and then we work beforehand 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:29.380
 computer graphics while preparing 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:31.929
 the templates on which we will manage the 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.850
 font height and style of the 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:36.700
 police and then we'll postpone this 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.940
 working on a layer I define everything 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.890
 first globally the space that I want 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.039
 use with this writing on the 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:48.340
 walls I define so I have spacing I 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:51.250
 chosen here to use 15 cm between each 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:56.530
 interligne here I have positioned my 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:59.399
 template in blue under the layer on the 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:04.870
 defined path and I will be able 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:07.060
 ironing around each line I'm going 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:14.440
 now install the layer on the 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:16.780
 wall the callus that is installed on the wall 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.810
 voluntarily young is fixed as to 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.840
 in order to be able to pass the carbon 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.320
 who will use me to draw on the wall by 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.580
 below 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:31.950
 and I start to trace 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.950
 I go back to the motive 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.530
 here are all the letters were drawn 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:44.050
 on the support I remove now calq 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:45.970
 and we'll see what's going on with them 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.800
 letters are written on the support and 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.680
 as often we will first work in 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.840
 white so I take white on the 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:59.230
 brush I try to have a white who 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:03.910
 not too fluid and I'm going to spend 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:07.120
 each blank letter I finished a 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:10.260
 first a first pass on white I 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:13.480
 start again to cover the tracks 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:16.060
 carbon and make my painting a 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.630
 little more covering and homogeneous so the 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.460
 first 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.560
 artix the blanking job is 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.720
 finished now we can move on to 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.190
 reals colors I will use a 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.530
 little bit of cream paint for 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.390
 start one is not obliged to 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.570
 go on these on his ranges of hues 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:35.130
 I'm going to pass but not everywhere 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.930
 already give me an idea of â€‹â€‹relief 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:41.470
 I try to draw the paint and I 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:44.920
 say that the direction of the elbow or blow 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:48.550
 of a brush also from the material to the 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.290
 letter I'm now crimping the 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.790
 letters giving them a little bit 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.440
 of shadow 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.660
 the ideal is really to respect a 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.040
 drying time so that the 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.270
 paintings do not mix and that we 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.390
 can work with the most 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:04.330
 finesse possible so I define that 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.600
 the shadow and on that side it means that 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:11.080
 the light comes here so all the 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:15.040
 parts that are work me I put a 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:17.740
 slight darker line 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.700
 we each take turns 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:24.310
 curve will receive some shade and then 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.960
 of light this work that I realize 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.750
 to painting can also quite 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.220
 be made with big felt 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.010
 we will be much more precise with a 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.320
 big fuck of painting 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.700
 the idea is that these letters are seen 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.350
 still far 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.950
 so that means we must not hesitate 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:45.580
 to do so a little further 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.080
 the dark liners and the same 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.970
 way now I'm going to work the 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.410
 light with white 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.050
 so for the white there I chose 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:56.800
 to use a titanium blank that has and 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:58.630
 covering and that will allow me to 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.730
 put a jitter and light like 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:04.240
 the shadow was inside the light 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:07.000
 comes in from above so I can 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.890
 start just asking keys of 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.230
 light and then little by little I'm going 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.970
 complete the work because small to 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.390
 small I will also understand where are 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.310
 the coherences for the white of the 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:22.270
 light 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:24.160
 I will try not to press too much 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.620
 the brush to not over apply the 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.590
 vaso paint possibly even 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.430
 left a little bit of relief 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.200
 in fact what is interesting 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.150
 painting is that nothing is ever 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.010
 definitive when we think we can 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.250
 do better we can improve 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:41.050
 can start painting again or over 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.760
 when we really are in a 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.490
 situation that seems catastrophic 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.200
 just put some white we wait 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.880
 that it dries and we restart in the 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.320
 work of color and more when we have 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.610
 the chance to work on a 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.890
 wall it's always interesting to 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.210
 back up a little bit of power 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.740
 gives away because by far the 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.200
 defects we see them very quickly and 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.270
 very very well and here is the message asked 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.260
 on the wall 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.530
 the person concerned who makes it possible to 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:07.300
 under stairs and then especially the 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.460
 specify where the kitchen is 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.770
 now here you know so write 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.600
 on a free wall to you to express this 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.370
 that you want to say on the walls 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.090
 you will see even your children will have 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.090
 want to imitate you
