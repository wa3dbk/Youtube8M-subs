I'm<00:01:41.850> thinking<00:01:42.119> about<00:01:42.179> maybe<00:01:42.450> even<00:01:42.720> bringing

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
I'm thinking about maybe even bringing

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.809 
I'm thinking about maybe even bringing
it<00:01:43.440> to<00:01:43.590> carnage<00:01:43.920> because<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.190> really<00:01:44.459> did<00:01:44.640> like

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:44.819

it<00:01:44.880> up<00:01:45.179> so<00:01:45.600> yeah<00:01:45.720> definitely<00:01:45.840> go<00:01:46.140> over<00:01:46.259> there

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
it up so yeah definitely go over there

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.020 
it up so yeah definitely go over there
and<00:01:46.470> check<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.800> out<00:01:46.860> obvious<00:01:47.459> devil<00:01:47.789> DNA

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
and check that out obvious devil DNA

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.059 
and check that out obvious devil DNA

insane<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:33.390> me<00:02:33.450> I<00:02:33.540> can<00:02:34.050> barely<00:02:34.290> get<00:02:34.500> a<00:02:34.560> DNA<00:02:34.920> on

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
insane to me I can barely get a DNA on

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.100 
insane to me I can barely get a DNA on
the<00:02:35.610> first<00:02:35.820> day<00:02:36.060> of<00:02:36.240> the<00:02:36.360> new<00:02:36.480> maps<00:02:36.630> coming<00:02:36.960> out

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
maps so far honestly I'm gonna have to

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.950 
maps so far honestly I'm gonna have to
say<00:02:54.300> that<00:02:54.480> mine<00:02:54.690> is<00:02:54.930> probably<00:02:56.630> quarantine<00:02:57.630> I

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
say that mine is probably quarantine I

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.600 
say that mine is probably quarantine I
don't<00:02:58.230> really<00:02:58.350> like<00:02:58.470> swarm<00:02:58.950> I<00:02:59.160> thought<00:02:59.400> my

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
don't really like swarm I thought my

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.550 
don't really like swarm I thought my
favorites<00:02:59.910> probably<00:03:00.150> quarantine<00:03:00.630> my<00:03:00.930> second

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
favorites probably quarantine my second

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.460 
favorites probably quarantine my second
favorite<00:03:02.040> is<00:03:02.540> overload<00:03:03.540> and<00:03:03.720> I<00:03:04.050> really<00:03:04.320> like
