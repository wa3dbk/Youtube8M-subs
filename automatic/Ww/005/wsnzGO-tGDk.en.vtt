00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.980
 I kill myself my life is a 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.530
 battlefield thousands of problems or 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.020
 pain I wake up I've got it 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.480
 The fog is actually lost only 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.129
 darkness that crushes me even that 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.769
 breathing is difficult 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:51.030
 there be strong but mine 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:54.220
 Akku is a teacher tormented by life 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:58.449
 the sorry inside of me it is days of 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:00.730
 It's days of mourning death 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:04.089
 like an ice cold shower my 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.800
 heart has your name i'm sadly missing 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.200
 me so much for me empty 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.399
 sadly I lack the strength to get up 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.149
 I'm tired 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:16.030
 no house my tears of love no matter where 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:17.740
 I'm gonna light it up for the sprite 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.899
 wine out and send a kiss for the 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.179
 all my therapy league i would like 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:23.090
 Time is not so high in the sky too 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:25.250
 put 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.289
 we are in thoughts and write with 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.539
 The pain of these lines is in tune 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:31.609
 wind and feel I'm alone that 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:33.770
 my therapy is hurt the 

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:36.200
 lines not as high seen in the sky 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.880
 make for me a thoughtfully provided 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.009
 and writes with pain of these lines 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.939
 hear voices in the wind and feel like I am 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:46.039
 I alone I think about early and 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.740
 then aware as it was is 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:50.990
 It's never again this world without you 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.539
 not the same anymore I always wear 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.520
 heart to my living sleep 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:58.399
 at night through the streets of my area 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.470
 Everywhere a reminder of a past 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.319
 I live can see the pictures of me 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.549
 and ask God every day why you me 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:06.560
 can not understand it 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.599
 I only know this gap is not 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.120
 palpable and that pain in mine 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:13.700
 Breast is not over I just know 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.170
 I want to keep going 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.660
 to take care of everyone and the fans 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.910
 stick together 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.230
 it changed me i'm not anymore 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.599
 the same everything has changed 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.330
 I find the candles for you applying the 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.769
 flowers on the grave and thoughts 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.110
 artist's hand my therapy lies 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.420
 ache high in the slow motion 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.190
 Seeing the sky we are in 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.620
 thoughts and writes with pain 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.540
 lines hear tunes in the wind and for you 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.730
 I'm alone that's my therapy 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.040
 I'm not hurting the time 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.200
 look up into the sky, see for 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.120
 I sink into thoughts and write 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.090
 It hurts me to listen to these lines 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.920
 In the wind and for you I am alone 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.629
 life holds ready for us all exams 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.489
 The worst of these are when we are 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:58.799
 have to bury family members 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.690
 death is omnipresent but one 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.640
 he can not die us he can not 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.170
 recollections are told by the 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.000
 people who have left us 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.890
 because then they will be in ours forever 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.840
 hearts and thoughts continue to live 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.700
 because they are really dead then 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.650
 I'm not talking about them anymore 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.720
 the memories have disappeared 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.700
 is my therapy league i want the 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.650
 Do not look so high in the sky 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.360
 for me the victory in thought and 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.310
 write with pain these lines hear 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.590
 I feel right in the winter I am 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.930
 but my therapy lies just for that 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.610
 do not hurt the time so high in the 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.500
 see sky set for me 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.959
 sink thoughts and write with 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.190
 hurt to pay your votes in the wind 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.190
 and I feel I am alone
