00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 very good of all today saying that 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:07.880
 we are in minecraft 1.5 points we are going to 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.210
 see a mod a mod that we have already seen 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:16.030
 in a way that a long time ago 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:20.320
 what is this you are not the gin 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:24.730
 you're not in the hotel tower are these 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:27.310
 actors as low as this good 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.140
 we saw the actors that those who wear 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:34.290
 a lot of time the castle was 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:36.270
 will tackle you in the second series of mods 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.840
 all cars have little things and in 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.590
 all the floors there are like two spawn of 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.310
 these 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.310
 there is no more 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:50.370
 and more things more because that's the way 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.440
 while the truth is that I am what 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.270
 I played I remember in the second we continue 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.730
 I will leave the link that the description by 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.550
 if you want to see her there I met wanda and 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.250
 my good love 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:07.210
 one morning 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:10.299
 or I kill you 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.820
 there is poisoned crushed we are what 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:15.610
 I played for a pack of motorcycles but no no 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.490
 I had found it loose simply and 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.850
 now for you as you see the things of 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.530
 you buy me but if we have mods 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.890
 are appearing things from the mods what 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:30.100
 which is pretty cool 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:33.120
 all these people and talk and this guy 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:36.090
 the rumba skeleton 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.670
 they're all so pretty cool sample of 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.370
 cool until we got to that 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.970
 we arrive at the last one that awaits us as 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:47.780
 the guardian fuck another 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:51.250
 the guardian this is the guardian this 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.250
 He put two hosts as loaves 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.900
 let's see let's try some things 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.600
 because before I was surprised that he has 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:01.250
 open the chest and the bug has jumped 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.220
 if not 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.660
 this bug is hard but like the sun 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.520
 right now, not because right now I'm 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.990
 in creative but in the series in the 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:16.500
 second we continue to agree to be killed 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.500
 normal simply and it cost me quite 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.170
 when we kill him 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.080
 good that there were diamonds in one's own 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.460
 from above the upper top chest is the 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.170
 best ever 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.830
 as soon as we kill him the tower goes away 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.830
 destroying 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:38.239
 this sounds as ethical as well as land or 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.239
 Stones or sand falling very epic 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.130
 and obviously when you go up they go 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.160
 picking up all the cars actually 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.020
 so then what do you have to worry about 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:55.980
 picking these 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:57.390
 but it's cool about this, it's not like 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.220
 pretty good and the truth is that it's cool 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.580
 very much having found it loose 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.110
 I did not know which one was 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.520
 and the truth is that it is very cool could 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.520
 put me to some other series 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:14.270
 today god balance 2 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.260
 we come down to clicas 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.260
 will come back for me 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.090
 crystal is that there are very rare things in 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:26.280
 some cars but good 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.319
 but this is the mod that the truth 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.440
 I'm glad I found it because 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.930
 surely yes 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.200
 if we do another series in summer I have 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:39.380
 thought of making a minimum number of 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.000
 some with some mods and this one the 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.730
 truth is that I would like to install more 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.070
 Now that I know what it's called, I know everything 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.260
 but you have in the description the 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.820
 link for the second series of mods by 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.370
 if someone is interested long ago 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.530
 time has changed a lot the way 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:04:02.950
 comment you have in the description 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:02.950
 there are also favorites everywhere 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.890
 you do not have to worry about that anymore and they go 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.800
 appearing a lot but good 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.370
 this month has liked is line favorites in 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.370
 half a lot 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.239
 bye
