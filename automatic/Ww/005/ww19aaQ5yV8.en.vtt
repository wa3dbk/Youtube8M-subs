00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.990 
chrome because sometimes the pinch to
zoom<00:02:03.819> isn't<00:02:04.479> the<00:02:04.659> best<00:02:04.960> but<00:02:05.859> right<00:02:06.579> here<00:02:06.789> it's

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
zoom isn't the best but right here it's

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.109 
zoom isn't the best but right here it's
working<00:02:07.539> really<00:02:07.990> good<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:09.399> just<00:02:09.580> pinch<00:02:09.910> in

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
working really good you just pinch in

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.550 
working really good you just pinch in
zoom<00:02:10.660> out<00:02:11.430> um<00:02:12.430> see<00:02:13.150> go<00:02:13.360> Google<00:02:14.170> crumbs<00:02:14.410> a

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
zoom out um see go Google crumbs a

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.630 
zoom out um see go Google crumbs a
little<00:02:14.739> bit<00:02:14.830> slow<00:02:15.040> with<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.280> pinch<00:02:15.489> to<00:02:15.610> zoom

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
little bit slow with the pinch to zoom

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.660 
little bit slow with the pinch to zoom
so<00:02:16.480> I<00:02:16.510> recommend<00:02:16.830> installing<00:02:17.830> dolphin

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
so I recommend installing dolphin

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.729 
so I recommend installing dolphin
browser<00:02:18.790> because<00:02:19.540> there's<00:02:20.019> really<00:02:20.230> no<00:02:20.500> lag<00:02:20.709> at

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
browser because there's really no lag at

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.470 
browser because there's really no lag at
all<00:02:20.980> it's<00:02:21.190> a<00:02:21.280> little<00:02:21.489> bit<00:02:21.610> slower<00:02:21.970> between

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
all it's a little bit slower between

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.780 
all it's a little bit slower between
searches<00:02:22.989> but<00:02:23.590> it's<00:02:23.739> just<00:02:23.950> a<00:02:24.069> lot<00:02:24.280> smoother

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
searches but it's just a lot smoother

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.960 
searches but it's just a lot smoother
and<00:02:25.000> better<00:02:25.180> experience<00:02:25.900> so<00:02:26.769> here's<00:02:27.099> msn<00:02:27.760> on

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
and better experience so here's msn on

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.780 
and better experience so here's msn on
that<00:02:28.569> dolphin<00:02:29.230> browser<00:02:29.349> and<00:02:29.799> just<00:02:30.549> showing

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790

you<00:02:30.940> it's<00:02:31.150> very<00:02:31.329> very<00:02:32.260> smooth<00:02:32.680> follows<00:02:33.549> my
