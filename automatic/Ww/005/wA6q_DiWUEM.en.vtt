00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.509
 this time I'm going to show you how 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:08.639
 get a light single anna blight 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.740
 improved machine gun ok this is achieved 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.780
 with four yellow discs that are 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.150
 as watered by various parts of the map 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.640
 ok these discs are achieved with the drone 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.080
 of maxis is very simple is the only thing that 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.250
 they need is the maxis drone and does not know 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.900
 how to build I leave the link in the 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.970
 screen of a description so that 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.490
 go see how to build it the first 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.599
 location of this yellow disk that 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.189
 we have to find is is 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.500
 right here on the side is the pack 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.120
 to pons here we are seeing here the pack 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.579
 props we go to the right and it's going to 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.380
 find here as above these as 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.110
 tables ok like some wooden boards 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.760
 good in these wooden boards that 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.020
 are here are the ones here is there 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.460
 you get to see the writing we do not 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.289
 we can do nothing but if we 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.910
 we increase our trunk of maxis waters 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.180
 with their roles with their weapons because the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.640
 will kill 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.440
 he grabbed it and destroyed it ok then there 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.210
 we have the first location and 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.280
 we have to activate four of these 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.870
 different ok we can bring the drone 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.100
 from maxis to the next location no 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.960
 there is no problem we do not need it 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.250
 unfold it every time we do it 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.080
 next location is here in the 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.520
 part of the church ok is located 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.410
 right up there and from 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.210
 corner of the church you already know about the 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.680
 same way bring your maxis drone or 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.570
 here deployment no there is no 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.760
 problem and he has to go and 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.130
 destroy that diskette that already when 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.440
 destroyed that disk from above we're going 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.060
 the next good the next record will 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.950
 found in the part of the 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.410
 country estate can be seen then later 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.990
 that yellow disk is like on top of 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.190
 a beam here of wood not then of 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.320
 same way you already know that they have their 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.180
 drone of maxis they throw it here so that 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.100
 destroy that disk and once you 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.170
 let's have that third album we're going with 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.790
 the fourth and last album and good gentlemen 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.590
 the last one is exactly in the 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.570
 part of the number one generator if 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.640
 we went out the main door of the 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.680
 generator number one we continue here 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.090
 is going to be there back to how 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.250
 of some debris in the same way already 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.380
 they know how to unfold their throne of mexico 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.060
 until I'm going to destroy it sounds to see 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.520
 sometimes it goes like the side and does the middle 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.890
 but good snacks and if you make stupid 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.079

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:05.470
