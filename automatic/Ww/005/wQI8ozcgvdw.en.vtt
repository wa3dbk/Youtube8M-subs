probably four main differences berry the
first<00:00:55.860> one<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.519> on<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.329> hull<00:00:57.570> itself<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.640> that

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
first one is on the hull itself and that

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.540 
first one is on the hull itself and that

ocean the second one is in hull shape

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.910 
ocean the second one is in hull shape
and<00:01:19.610> the<00:01:20.610> ocean<00:01:21.090> liner<00:01:21.390> has<00:01:21.810> much<00:01:22.049> finer<00:01:22.470> lines

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
and the ocean liner has much finer lines

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.149 
and the ocean liner has much finer lines
forward<00:01:23.640> which<00:01:23.850> means<00:01:24.149> that<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.740> takes<00:01:25.740> longer

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
forward which means that it takes longer

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.309 
forward which means that it takes longer
along<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.880> length<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.450> hull<00:01:27.810> for<00:01:28.229> the

ship to reach its widest point this

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.340 
ship to reach its widest point this
allows<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.929> hull<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.409> cut<00:01:31.710> into<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.490> ocean

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
allows the hull to cut into the ocean

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.169 
allows the hull to cut into the ocean
nicely<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.530> smoothly<00:01:34.920> without<00:01:35.310> slowing<00:01:35.909> the

nicely and smoothly without slowing the
ship<00:01:36.420> down<00:01:37.069> it<00:01:38.069> also<00:01:38.580> reduces<00:01:38.940> the<00:01:39.750> tendency

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
ship down it also reduces the tendency

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.149 
ship down it also reduces the tendency
of<00:01:40.679> the<00:01:40.920> ship<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.960> react<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.289> large<00:01:43.590> ocean

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
swell by pitching more the cruise ships

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.050 
swell by pitching more the cruise ships
are<00:01:47.880> wider<00:01:48.630> further<00:01:49.200> forward<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.670> they<00:01:50.850> have

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
are wider further forward and they have

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.749 
are wider further forward and they have
more<00:01:51.270> buoyancy<00:01:51.750> than<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:52.500> as<00:01:52.679> an<00:01:53.100> ocean<00:01:53.280> swell

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
more buoyancy than so as an ocean swell

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.669 
more buoyancy than so as an ocean swell
comes<00:01:54.090> along<00:01:54.390> they<00:01:54.569> tend<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.989> react<00:01:55.349> violent

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
comes along they tend to react violent

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:59.680 
comes along they tend to react violent
and<00:01:56.459> pitch<00:01:56.989> rapidly<00:01:57.989> so<00:01:58.679> the<00:01:58.860> ocean<00:01:59.190> liner

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
and pitch rapidly so the ocean liner

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.460 
and pitch rapidly so the ocean liner
maintains<00:02:00.690> a<00:02:00.950> more<00:02:01.950> steady<00:02:02.340> motion<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.470> the

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
maintains a more steady motion and the

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.710 
maintains a more steady motion and the
weight<00:02:04.679> of<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.069> ocean<00:02:05.429> liner<00:02:05.700> it's<00:02:06.330> heavier

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
weight of the ocean liner it's heavier

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.710 
weight of the ocean liner it's heavier
it's<00:02:06.989> heavier<00:02:07.379> steel<00:02:07.860> makes<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.910> sit<00:02:09.149> deeper

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
it's heavier steel makes it sit deeper

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.949 
it's heavier steel makes it sit deeper
in<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.959> water<00:02:10.129> so<00:02:11.129> that<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.690> has<00:02:12.690> more

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
in the water so that it has more

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.330 
in the water so that it has more
stability<00:02:13.379> in<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.629> ocean<00:02:15.629> swell<00:02:16.040> so<00:02:17.040> then<00:02:17.190> the

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
stability in the ocean swell so then the

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.290 
stability in the ocean swell so then the
third<00:02:17.610> major<00:02:18.120> item<00:02:18.690> is<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.680> power<00:02:20.099> and<00:02:20.519> the

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
third major item is the power and the

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.380 
third major item is the power and the
power<00:02:21.569> is<00:02:22.370> increased<00:02:23.370> substantially<00:02:23.670> there's

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
power is increased substantially there's

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.449 
power is increased substantially there's

days<00:02:53.470> at<00:02:53.680> sea<00:02:53.920> and<00:02:54.220> we<00:02:54.460> need<00:02:54.670> to<00:02:54.850> occupy<00:02:55.270> our

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
days at sea and we need to occupy our

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.840 
days at sea and we need to occupy our
guests<00:02:56.910> with<00:02:57.910> things<00:02:58.420> to<00:02:58.690> do<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:59.460> space<00:03:00.460> to

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
guests with things to do and space to

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.720 
guests with things to do and space to
roam<00:03:01.260> while<00:03:02.260> we<00:03:02.500> have<00:03:02.650> all<00:03:02.830> those<00:03:03.010> Dayton<00:03:03.520> see

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
roam while we have all those Dayton see

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.510 
roam while we have all those Dayton see
and<00:03:04.000> so<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:04.930> volume<00:03:05.410> of<00:03:05.620> the<00:03:05.950> passenger

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
and so the volume of the passenger

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.360 
and so the volume of the passenger
spaces<00:03:07.090> is<00:03:07.300> increased<00:03:08.080> and<00:03:08.410> you<00:03:08.950> just<00:03:09.160> have

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
spaces is increased and you just have

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.910 
spaces is increased and you just have
more<00:03:09.640> space<00:03:10.030> per<00:03:10.360> passenger<00:03:10.570> inside<00:03:11.320> the

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
more space per passenger inside the

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.790 
more space per passenger inside the
ocean<00:03:12.040> liner<00:03:12.900> traveling<00:03:13.900> can<00:03:14.020> sometimes<00:03:14.500> be<00:03:14.770> a

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
ocean liner traveling can sometimes be a

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.500 
ocean liner traveling can sometimes be a
little<00:03:14.980> bit<00:03:15.220> tricky<00:03:15.700> so<00:03:15.910> it's<00:03:16.120> always

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
little bit tricky so it's always

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.390 
little bit tricky so it's always
important<00:03:17.290> to<00:03:17.610> be<00:03:18.610> better<00:03:19.240> safe<00:03:19.810> than<00:03:20.110> sorry

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
important to be better safe than sorry

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.920 
important to be better safe than sorry
so<00:03:21.400> I<00:03:21.430> would<00:03:21.730> recommend<00:03:21.760> visiting<00:03:22.360> the
