00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.360
 there are some who say that we are trying to develop a kit of 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.439
 conversion 

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:15.850
 ddy Kurdish internal combustion awarded the kings the idea this 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.850
 e this kit that would be a kind of artifact 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:24.409
 peking 5 like alert vehicles is usually major modifications to 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:25.710
 to the vehicle 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.239
 that then tries to compensate existing vehicles 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:35.420
 which would be many advantages first we could make the 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.970
 vehicles in fact are now internal combustion 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.770
 of people 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.630
 air pollutants 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.730
 and on the other hand also asks is that you get to Brasilia a lot of gas 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.320
 we are thinking 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.430
 that she efficiency 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.600
 of a hybrid vehicle is around 50% which would be a huge 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.900
 save yourself in st 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.440
 jimÃ©nez 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.440
 it could be an option for 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.550
 we have our oil reserves was reading 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.940
 he says yes 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.450
 the descents vehicles to concentrate rather we want to take them to the 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.900
 mechanic mates 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.300
 that who three days return them completely 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.120
 we are working precisely in two the revenge with messi first for 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.860
 urban buses of the faithful wait to be enemies to be respected 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.310
 the cti in the second wants conversion in taxi vehicles because 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.430
 because we've noticed that there are two types of applications that run 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.750
 daily more than 280 kilometers 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.530
 Useful rise is not 10 years as the same Tuesday 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.050
 maximum 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.980
 at present 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.980
 we are so developed per cent the procedure 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.110
 percent based on certain parameters of cost efficiency 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.079
 to determine the purchase of material for these two applications
