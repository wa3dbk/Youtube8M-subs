theories<00:00:52.379> about<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:53.129> real<00:00:53.399> quick<00:00:53.670> they

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
theories about that real quick they

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.080 
theories about that real quick they

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
could sell it as a standalone or they

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.580 
could sell it as a standalone or they
could<00:00:57.149> just<00:00:57.329> include<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.960> as<00:00:58.109> an<00:00:58.260> update

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
could just include it as an update

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.950 
could just include it as an update
because<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:59.250> was<00:00:59.640> what<00:01:00.000> was<00:01:00.210> promised<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.870> us

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
because that was what was promised to us

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.340 
because that was what was promised to us
in<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.680> GTA<00:01:02.070> 5<00:01:02.190> online<00:01:02.820> reveal<00:01:03.510> trailer<00:01:03.870> but

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
in the GTA 5 online reveal trailer but

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.140 
in the GTA 5 online reveal trailer but
it's<00:01:04.470> hard<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.769> tell<00:01:05.040> with<00:01:05.250> Rockstar<00:01:05.760> because

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
it's hard to tell with Rockstar because

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.020 
it's hard to tell with Rockstar because
they<00:01:06.299> either<00:01:06.650> impressed<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.979> really<00:01:08.700> bring

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
they either impressed and really bring

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.690 
they either impressed and really bring
the<00:01:09.060> fans<00:01:09.390> together<00:01:09.689> or<00:01:10.590> they<00:01:10.950> really<00:01:11.369> really

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
the fans together or they really really

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.820 
the fans together or they really really
disappoint<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.570> fans<00:01:12.600> like<00:01:13.200> they<00:01:13.380> did<00:01:13.619> by

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
disappoint the fans like they did by

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.190 
disappoint the fans like they did by
taking<00:01:14.400> people's<00:01:14.760> hard-earned<00:01:15.210> money<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:16.049> I'm

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
taking people's hard-earned money so I'm

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.539 
taking people's hard-earned money so I'm
not<00:01:16.320> really<00:01:16.530> sure<00:01:16.619> how<00:01:17.009> that's<00:01:17.250> going<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.460> play

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
not really sure how that's going to play

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.340 
not really sure how that's going to play
out<00:01:17.759> because<00:01:18.330> they<00:01:18.600> could<00:01:18.810> go<00:01:18.960> either<00:01:19.200> way

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
out because they could go either way

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.859 
out because they could go either way
with<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.770> or<00:01:20.430> they<00:01:20.820> could<00:01:20.880> just<00:01:21.030> combined<00:01:21.689> it

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
with that or they could just combined it

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.170 
with that or they could just combined it
with<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.200> new<00:01:22.350> storyline<00:01:22.979> dlc<00:01:23.460> but<00:01:23.790> from<00:01:24.090> a

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
with the new storyline dlc but from a

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.999 
with the new storyline dlc but from a
business<00:01:24.210> standpoint<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.409> would<00:01:25.650> make<00:01:25.860> more

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
business standpoint it would make more

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.460 
business standpoint it would make more
sense<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.580> release<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.119> as<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.240> standalone<00:01:27.780> DLC

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
sense to release it as a standalone DLC

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.469 
sense to release it as a standalone DLC
so<00:01:29.100> they<00:01:29.250> can<00:01:29.430> just<00:01:29.640> keep<00:01:29.850> bringing<00:01:30.299> more

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
so they can just keep bringing more

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.940 
so they can just keep bringing more
money<00:01:30.750> into<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.320> grand<00:01:31.619> theft<00:01:31.770> auto

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
money into the grand theft auto

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.700 
money into the grand theft auto
franchise<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:33.180> that's<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.960> only<00:01:33.990> two<00:01:34.470> things

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
franchise so that's the only two things

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.090 
franchise so that's the only two things
that<00:01:34.890> have<00:01:35.189> been<00:01:35.220> confirmed<00:01:35.909> for<00:01:36.079> 2014

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100

I<00:02:39.209> said<00:02:39.239> all<00:02:39.690> of<00:02:39.870> these<00:02:40.019> could<00:02:40.230> be<00:02:40.410> DLC<00:02:40.950> but<00:02:41.280> I'm

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
I said all of these could be DLC but I'm

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.650 
I said all of these could be DLC but I'm

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
characters Franklin is going to be

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.800

paired<00:03:17.489> up<00:03:17.670> with<00:03:17.820> more<00:03:18.239> you're<00:03:18.510> going<00:03:18.600> to<00:03:18.720> get

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
paired up with more you're going to get

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.539 
paired up with more you're going to get
a<00:03:18.870> backstory<00:03:19.320> of<00:03:19.470> those<00:03:19.709> two<00:03:19.980> and<00:03:20.190> then

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
a backstory of those two and then

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.009 
a backstory of those two and then
Michael<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:21.150> Trevor<00:03:21.299> are<00:03:21.540> going<00:03:21.810> to<00:03:21.870> get<00:03:21.989> a

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
Michael and Trevor are going to get a

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.539 
Michael and Trevor are going to get a
backstory<00:03:22.500> as<00:03:22.709> well<00:03:22.920> and<00:03:23.220> there's

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
backstory as well and there's

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.300 
backstory as well and there's
intertwined<00:03:24.329> so<00:03:24.900> I'm<00:03:25.260> thinking<00:03:25.290> they<00:03:26.100> might

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
intertwined so I'm thinking they might

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.880 
intertwined so I'm thinking they might
also<00:03:26.670> add<00:03:27.090> Canada<00:03:27.810> into<00:03:28.350> the<00:03:28.440> mix<00:03:28.650> north

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
also add Canada into the mix north

I<00:03:42.239> kind<00:03:42.630> of<00:03:42.690> think<00:03:42.810> they're<00:03:42.989> going<00:03:43.079> to<00:03:43.139> try<00:03:43.560> to

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
I kind of think they're going to try to

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.650 
I kind of think they're going to try to
follow<00:03:44.250> in<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:44.549> footsteps<00:03:44.700> of<00:03:45.000> saints<00:03:45.450> row<00:03:45.630> 3

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
follow in the footsteps of saints row 3

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.050 
follow in the footsteps of saints row 3
and<00:03:46.079> 4<00:03:46.319> but<00:03:46.859> make<00:03:47.040> it<00:03:47.069> that<00:03:47.340> Grand<00:03:47.790> Theft<00:03:47.910> Auto

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
and 4 but make it that Grand Theft Auto

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.210 
and 4 but make it that Grand Theft Auto
feel<00:03:48.540> because<00:03:48.900> we<00:03:49.230> had<00:03:49.440> the<00:03:49.560> missions<00:03:50.010> where

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
feel because we had the missions where

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.890 
feel because we had the missions where
they<00:03:50.370> were<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.579> hallucination<00:03:51.389> missions<00:03:51.720> and

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
they were the hallucination missions and

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.090 
they were the hallucination missions and
people<00:03:52.739> love<00:03:53.040> those<00:03:53.340> so<00:03:54.030> they<00:03:54.810> could<00:03:55.109> go<00:03:55.470> into

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
people love those so they could go into

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.290 
people love those so they could go into
a<00:03:56.370> whole<00:03:56.670> alien<00:03:56.910> invasion<00:03:57.480> dlc

they all could transfer into the
multiplayer<00:04:06.520> where<00:04:07.240> like<00:04:07.510> I<00:04:07.630> said<00:04:07.930> how<00:04:08.170> have

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440

the back story of the characters and

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.060

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.310 
then you have michael trevor in north
