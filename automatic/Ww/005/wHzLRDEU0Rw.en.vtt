this mountain each time breaking into
different<00:00:15.299> sony<00:00:15.540> products

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:32.900 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.080 

smashing<00:00:33.900> things<00:00:34.110> looking<00:00:34.620> right<00:00:35.190> there<00:00:35.430> it's

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
smashing things looking right there it's

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.810 
smashing things looking right there it's
like<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.300> being<00:00:36.600> like<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:36.900> big<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.170> kid

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.740 

shooting<00:00:41.820> with<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.059> facts<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.570> can<00:00:42.660> be

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
shooting with the facts it can be

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.210 
shooting with the facts it can be
difficult<00:00:42.900> because<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.830> have<00:00:43.949> to<00:00:44.070> use<00:00:44.190> your

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 
difficult because you have to use your

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.189 
difficult because you have to use your
imagination<00:00:45.089> you<00:00:45.360> want<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.720> see<00:00:45.900> what<00:00:46.079> you're

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
imagination you want to see what you're

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:47.299 
imagination you want to see what you're
shooting<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.680> sometimes<00:00:46.949> you<00:00:47.070> just<00:00:47.220> can't

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
shooting and sometimes you just can't

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.280 
shooting and sometimes you just can't
and<00:00:47.790> you<00:00:47.850> have<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.089> trust<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.960> effects

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
and you have to trust that the effects

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.500 
and you have to trust that the effects
people<00:00:49.470> are<00:00:49.829> going<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.430> make<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:51.000> all<00:00:51.150> come<00:00:51.360> to

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
people are going to make it all come to

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.420 
people are going to make it all come to
life<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.989> make<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.320> feel<00:00:52.530> great<00:00:52.800> our<00:00:53.190> first

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
life and make it feel great our first

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.829 
life and make it feel great our first
thing<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.790> start<00:00:54.150> with<00:00:54.269> what<00:00:54.449> looks<00:00:54.600> real

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:54.839 
thing is to start with what looks real

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:57.140 
thing is to start with what looks real
we<00:00:55.230> can<00:00:55.409> then<00:00:55.530> take<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.280> from<00:00:56.309> being<00:00:56.610> real<00:00:56.850> to

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150 
we can then take it from being real to

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.420 
we can then take it from being real to
making<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.510> look<00:00:57.720> almost<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.620> hyper<00:00:58.920> real<00:00:59.250> as

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
making it look almost that hyper real as

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.160 
making it look almost that hyper real as
if<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.670> were<00:00:59.760> shooting<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.210> studio<00:01:00.629> and

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
if you were shooting in a studio and

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.540 
if you were shooting in a studio and
actually<00:01:01.500> making<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.890> product<00:01:02.219> really

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
actually making that product really

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.340 
actually making that product really
beautiful<00:01:02.940> we<00:01:03.600> were<00:01:03.690> just<00:01:03.719> doing<00:01:04.110> trying<00:01:04.320> to

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
beautiful we were just doing trying to

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.630 
beautiful we were just doing trying to
do<00:01:04.470> some<00:01:04.649> hits<00:01:04.830> in<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.039> snow<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.250> minute<00:01:05.580> you

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
do some hits in the snow a minute you

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.130 
do some hits in the snow a minute you
can<00:01:05.759> see<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.000> sounds<00:01:06.240> really<00:01:06.479> really<00:01:06.570> hard<00:01:06.840> so

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
can see the sounds really really hard so

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.960 
can see the sounds really really hard so
that<00:01:07.229> when<00:01:07.380> we<00:01:07.410> have<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.830> 3d<00:01:08.640> objects

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
that when we have the 3d objects

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.969 
that when we have the 3d objects
bouncing<00:01:09.360> down<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.539> snow<00:01:09.840> we<00:01:09.990> have<00:01:10.110> some<00:01:10.289> real

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
bouncing down the snow we have some real

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.430 
bouncing down the snow we have some real
interaction<00:01:11.330> in<00:01:12.330> order<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.720> get<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.289> right

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
interaction in order to get the right

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.560 
interaction in order to get the right
lighting<00:01:13.710> effect<00:01:14.190> for<00:01:14.369> our<00:01:14.460> virtual<00:01:15.119> blu-ray

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
lighting effect for our virtual blu-ray

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.029 
lighting effect for our virtual blu-ray
player<00:01:15.840> with<00:01:16.110> taking<00:01:16.530> maps<00:01:16.740> in<00:01:16.920> this

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039 
player with taking maps in this

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:18.410 
player with taking maps in this
environment<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.759> then<00:01:17.910> we<00:01:18.060> can<00:01:18.210> light<00:01:18.390> it

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
environment so then we can light it

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.020 
environment so then we can light it
using<00:01:18.899> those<00:01:19.020> maps<00:01:19.350> in<00:01:19.560> 3d<00:01:20.039> can<00:01:20.429> we<00:01:20.610> literally

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
using those maps in 3d can we literally

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.990 
using those maps in 3d can we literally
let<00:01:21.179> er<00:01:21.210> go<00:01:21.300> in<00:01:21.929> these<00:01:22.140> shots<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.700> turn<00:01:23.970> it

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
let er go in these shots and you turn it

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.609 
let er go in these shots and you turn it
back<00:01:24.210> into<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.479> real<00:01:24.630> camera<00:01:24.869> The<00:01:25.229> Andrews<00:01:25.410> got

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
back into a real camera The Andrews got

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.080 
back into a real camera The Andrews got
very<00:01:25.890> strong<00:01:26.190> idea<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.610> what<00:01:26.820> we've<00:01:27.000> been

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
very strong idea of what we've been

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.219 
very strong idea of what we've been
trying<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.390> realize<00:01:27.690> that<00:01:27.720> through<00:01:28.110> all<00:01:28.140> the

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
trying to realize that through all the

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.230 
trying to realize that through all the
previous<00:01:28.740> this<00:01:29.130> helps<00:01:29.429> us<00:01:29.580> to<00:01:29.850> get<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.119> where

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
previous this helps us to get to where

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.330 
previous this helps us to get to where
we<00:01:30.329> are<00:01:30.360> now<00:01:30.450> which<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:30.900> obviously<00:01:31.710> seeing<00:01:32.040> how

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
we are now which is obviously seeing how

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.950 
we are now which is obviously seeing how
we<00:01:32.400> can<00:01:32.490> realize<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.119> on<00:01:33.210> location<00:01:33.689> can<00:01:33.900> you

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
we can realize that on location can you

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.510 
we can realize that on location can you
use<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.200> black<00:01:34.380> camera<00:01:34.710> from<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.040> drop<00:01:35.250> move

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
use the black camera from to drop move

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.370 
use the black camera from to drop move
it<00:01:35.610> out<00:01:35.700> as<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.000> reference<00:01:36.420> why<00:01:36.630> not<00:01:36.780> optic<00:01:37.049> yeah

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
it out as a reference why not optic yeah

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.630 
it out as a reference why not optic yeah
yeah<00:01:37.619> we'll<00:01:37.799> remove<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.189> rubber<00:01:38.340> one<00:01:38.520> and

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
yeah we'll remove the rubber one and

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.190 
yeah we'll remove the rubber one and
replace<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.909> with<00:01:39.060> 3d<00:01:39.479> one<00:01:39.689> but<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.900> gives<00:01:39.990> us

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
replace it with 3d one but it gives us

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.850 
replace it with 3d one but it gives us
an<00:01:41.009> idea<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.399> scale<00:01:42.110> lighting<00:01:43.110> because<00:01:43.500> we<00:01:43.740> can

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
an idea of scale lighting because we can

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:44.929 
an idea of scale lighting because we can
see<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.009> lighting<00:01:44.310> on<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.460> black<00:01:44.640> con<00:01:44.820> as

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
see the lighting on the black con as

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.359 
see the lighting on the black con as
well<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.570> amount<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.899> hours<00:01:46.229> man<00:01:46.890> hours<00:01:47.100> that

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
well the amount of hours man hours that

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.539 
well the amount of hours man hours that
goes<00:01:47.549> into<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.850> project<00:01:48.210> like<00:01:48.299> this<00:01:48.360> sir<00:01:48.689> I

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
goes into a project like this sir I

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.940 
goes into a project like this sir I
remember<00:01:50.549> how<00:01:50.640> many<00:01:50.700> hours<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.119> up<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.420> so<00:01:51.600> far

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
remember how many hours is up to so far

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.540 
this for the shot where the blue rays
are<00:02:03.750> reforming<00:02:04.230> after<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.680> initial<00:02:04.950> breakup

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.440 
shot the first time they reform and we
need<00:02:08.070> to<00:02:08.250> kind<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.820> see<00:02:09.030> what's<00:02:09.180> happening

don't<00:02:11.950> work<00:02:12.190> out<00:02:12.370> behind<00:02:12.640> that<00:02:12.820> lot<00:02:13.150> of

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
don't work out behind that lot of

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.330 
don't work out behind that lot of
managing<00:02:13.720> with<00:02:13.960> almost<00:02:14.440> treated<00:02:14.950> this<00:02:15.070> like<00:02:15.310> a

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
managing with almost treated this like a

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.060 
managing with almost treated this like a
film<00:02:15.850> pipeline<00:02:16.300> where<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:17.050> beginning<00:02:17.800> stages

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
film pipeline where the beginning stages

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.920 
film pipeline where the beginning stages
and<00:02:18.520> we're<00:02:18.700> all<00:02:18.850> just<00:02:19.120> really<00:02:19.300> starting<00:02:19.780> with

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
and we're all just really starting with

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.720 
and we're all just really starting with
proper<00:02:20.200> productions<00:02:20.770> well<00:02:20.980> it's<00:02:21.370> still<00:02:21.580> just

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
proper productions well it's still just

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.200 
proper productions well it's still just
the<00:02:21.880> beginning<00:02:22.240> but<00:02:22.570> we've<00:02:22.720> got<00:02:22.840> a<00:02:22.870> long<00:02:22.990> wait
