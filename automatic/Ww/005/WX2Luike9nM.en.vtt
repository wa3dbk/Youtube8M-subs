00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:09.540 

so<00:03:04.569> really<00:03:04.900> the<00:03:05.079> handling<00:03:05.349> is<00:03:05.470> good<00:03:05.620> you<00:03:05.739> see

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:19.650 

that<00:03:10.060> one

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.080 

really<00:03:20.230> it<00:03:20.290> makes<00:03:20.440> fun<00:03:20.710> to<00:03:20.890> drive<00:03:21.160> even<00:03:21.820> if

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
cars and for that fall at the price I

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.620 
cars and for that fall at the price I

get really hot chopper produced by
common

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
common

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.890 
common
it<00:03:36.050> works<00:03:36.350> very<00:03:36.470> well<00:03:37.300> so<00:03:38.300> what<00:03:38.480> you<00:03:38.720> should

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
it works very well so what you should

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.480 
it works very well so what you should
not<00:03:39.320> buy<00:03:39.590> is<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:41.060> early<00:03:41.630> models<00:03:42.160> like<00:03:43.160> from

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
not buy is the early models like from

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.270 
not buy is the early models like from
like<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:44.850> first<00:03:45.030> build<00:03:45.360> and<00:03:45.660> 2003<00:03:46.650> in<00:03:46.710> 2004

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
like the first build and 2003 in 2004

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.810 
like the first build and 2003 in 2004
for<00:03:47.970> non-commercial<00:03:48.510> because<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:50.250> camshaft

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
for non-commercial because the camshaft

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.160 
for non-commercial because the camshaft
drivetrain<00:03:51.420> is<00:03:52.700> rather<00:03:53.700> broken<00:03:54.060> faster<00:03:54.810> so<00:03:55.140> we

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
drivetrain is rather broken faster so we

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.260 
drivetrain is rather broken faster so we
concentrate<00:03:55.860> on<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.190> later<00:03:56.580> models<00:03:57.030> and

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
concentrate on the later models and

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.660 
concentrate on the later models and
especially<00:03:57.540> went<00:03:57.930> on<00:03:58.080> convertible<00:03:58.740> it's<00:03:59.010> 2005

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
especially went on convertible it's 2005

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.290 
especially went on convertible it's 2005
and<00:03:59.880> the<00:04:00.270> convertible<00:04:00.690> it's<00:04:00.960> 2005<00:04:01.530> and<00:04:01.710> later

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
and the convertible it's 2005 and later

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.560 
and the convertible it's 2005 and later
so

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
so

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.590 
so
best<00:04:04.230> I<00:04:04.410> think<00:04:04.650> in<00:04:04.770> my<00:04:04.890> opinion<00:04:05.280> is<00:04:05.430> get<00:04:05.640> 2007

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
best I think in my opinion is get 2007

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.790 
best I think in my opinion is get 2007
or<00:04:06.810> 2008<00:04:07.460> after<00:04:08.460> 2009<00:04:09.360> model<00:04:09.750> year<00:04:09.780> of<00:04:10.260> this

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
or 2008 after 2009 model year of this

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.050 
or 2008 after 2009 model year of this
one

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.920 

so

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
so

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.099 
so
