00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:12.179
 Saturday maybe welcome others rosell from 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.480
 butt 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.920
 this this is my first former play 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.250
 double view 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.650
 now you wonder what's going to double 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.350
 view after my translated note 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.210
 from English it means double vision 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.189
 in fact now you see two 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.590
 shots one in which he says of 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.430
 use the gamepad is one in which it says 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.880
 use the remote control and what is the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.010
 reason 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.649
 the reason is to see two perspectives 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.100
 different of the same level and of the 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.989
 same game in fact this system 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.210
 I have already spoken a little while ago 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.180
 does it on a video regarding 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.420
 the audio in fact having two shots 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.760
 we also have two different audi such as 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.250
 hear the audio of this video 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.940
 you will understand only if you will look precisely 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.010
 what I did long ago 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.159
 and that I have not implemented anyway but I have 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:11.030
 decided to take advantage of this 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:13.159
 resp.le of nintendo land precisely 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.869
 going on a bottle quest and maybe in 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.290
 future I will also do something similar and 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:21.009
 I know brancher but for now nothing for now 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.470
 let's do this that already 15 parties 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.090
 maximum 15 parks then I don't know and the 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.600
 parts will be very short I will make up 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.250
 children on the side and what to say to 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.320
 part of which is already running out of breath 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.539
 because I'm talking in a hurry since 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.560
 there is very little time is honoring later 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:42.590
 the game because they don't always succeed 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.270
 on the first attempt since the internet is 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.810
 a very competitive and above all game 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.030
 this attraction that I decided to do 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.880
 at the master level, therefore what does it mean 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.710
 that I cannot suffer damage and when 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.819
 I no longer have the master level 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.679
 I have to do it all over again 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:01.310
 and this is one of the reasons why not 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:03.350
 I can make the comment live is fine 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.590
 talk a little about the game 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.540
 all the details on how to hear the audio 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.910
 see them 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.850
 video that is in description and therefore 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:18.550
 I won't dwell on it that much 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:21.480
 then holding the sword does not frame 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.160
 its below you can see it loads a 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.680
 ray of light up to those skyward 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.590
 sword is the master sword team is a bit 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.850
 more powerful than those who double a little 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:36.550
 like when you upload opinions to the arc 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.520
 on whether it is better to use the sword or if 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.709
 it is better to use the bow 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.330
 in the end they are at par as with 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:47.560
 the bow you cannot avoid the moves 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:50.080
 close together and with the shield you can parry 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.120
 all but you can't attack the distance 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.970
 however, it can also be a bit 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.610
 African problematic in certain 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.440
 points for those with little precision with the 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.780
 sword etcetera etc. while with 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.250
 the arch, for example, these enemies here 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.600
 that I'm beating with the sword below 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.239
 which is a meter in a different shield 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.310
 positions and if so strikes the shield yes 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.860
 is mobilized for some time and 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.110
 you risk being hit as you see 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.820
 the last blow happened and he set himself 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:23.280
 paused that video 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:26.690
 in fact that video will only resume 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.980
 when I have reached the same point 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.019
 also upstairs 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.720
 red good that lasted little and that is the 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:37.569
 comment was not much but more or 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.370
 minus all the parts will be so is a le 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.129
 splendid to see if you like the 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.909
 system and nothing see you at 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:46.860
 next 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:46.860
 bye bye and leave a thumb up
