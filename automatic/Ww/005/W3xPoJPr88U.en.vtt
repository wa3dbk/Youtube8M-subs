about to go down got the car to go to

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.780 
about to go down got the car to go to
differential<00:01:51.560> I'll<00:01:52.560> put<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:53.010> in<00:01:53.250> all<00:01:53.640> the

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
differential I'll put that in all the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.640 
differential I'll put that in all the
tools<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.180> gonna<00:01:54.360> back<00:01:54.510> on<00:01:54.690> my<00:01:54.810> boy<00:01:54.990> truck

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
so far the car is jacked up wait for it

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.660 
so far the car is jacked up wait for it
to<00:02:15.210> cool<00:02:15.390> down<00:02:15.680> we<00:02:16.680> got<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.950> old<00:02:17.100> we<00:02:17.430> got<00:02:17.580> the

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
to cool down we got the old we got the

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.280 
to cool down we got the old we got the
new<00:02:17.820> diff<00:02:18.060> right<00:02:18.300> here<00:02:18.540> well<00:02:18.780> it's<00:02:18.900> not<00:02:18.990> brand

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
new diff right here well it's not brand

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.740 
new diff right here well it's not brand
new<00:02:19.350> but<00:02:19.650> you<00:02:20.370> know<00:02:20.460> I<00:02:20.490> mean<00:02:20.730> we<00:02:21.300> got<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.570> diff

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
new but you know I mean we got the diff

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.840 
new but you know I mean we got the diff
right<00:02:21.990> here<00:02:22.170> what<00:02:23.070> I'm<00:02:23.190> about<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.340> do<00:02:23.550> is<00:02:23.670> drain

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
right here what I'm about to do is drain

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.460 
right here what I'm about to do is drain
the<00:02:24.000> oil<00:02:24.030> out<00:02:24.330> of<00:02:24.390> this<00:02:24.600> differential<00:02:25.140> because

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
the oil out of this differential because

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.900 
the oil out of this differential because
we're<00:02:25.620> not<00:02:25.740> sure<00:02:25.890> how<00:02:26.100> many<00:02:26.160> miles<00:02:26.490> of<00:02:26.670> got<00:02:26.790> on

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
we're not sure how many miles of got on

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.370 
we're not sure how many miles of got on
it<00:02:27.060> approximately<00:02:27.870> I<00:02:28.020> believe<00:02:28.290> the

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
it approximately I believe the

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.110 
it approximately I believe the
chromeless<00:02:28.590> at<00:02:28.830> about<00:02:29.040> 50<00:02:29.340> 60<00:02:29.460> thousand<00:02:29.970> loss

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
chromeless at about 50 60 thousand loss

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.810 
chromeless at about 50 60 thousand loss
we<00:02:30.900> got<00:02:31.020> it<00:02:31.110> all<00:02:31.230> after<00:02:31.560> we<00:02:31.620> trained<00:02:31.860> it<00:02:32.010> but<00:02:32.790> I

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
we got it all after we trained it but I

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.580 
we got it all after we trained it but I
putting<00:02:33.090> this<00:02:33.150> new<00:02:33.360> uh<00:02:33.390> Castro<00:02:34.080> hyper<00:02:34.290> gear

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
putting this new uh Castro hyper gear

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.080 
putting this new uh Castro hyper gear
are<00:02:34.740> you<00:02:34.860> I<00:02:35.070> was<00:02:35.460> told<00:02:35.670> there<00:02:35.790> supposed<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.030> be

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
are you I was told there supposed to be

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.300 
are you I was told there supposed to be
some<00:02:36.300> good<00:02:36.480> gear<00:02:36.660> oil<00:02:36.990> that<00:02:37.709> natural<00:02:38.100> gear

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
some good gear oil that natural gear

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.680 
some good gear oil that natural gear
protection<00:02:38.760> so<00:02:38.910> we'll<00:02:39.060> find<00:02:39.209> out<00:02:41.450> and<00:02:42.450> I'll

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
protection so we'll find out and I'll

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.180 
protection so we'll find out and I'll
just<00:02:42.930> put<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.200> record<00:02:43.500> again<00:02:43.740> with<00:02:43.950> what<00:02:44.100> we're

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
just put a record again with what we're

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.880 
just put a record again with what we're
going<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.370> do<00:02:44.490> is<00:02:44.610> take<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:44.850> base<00:02:45.390> model<00:02:45.690> non<00:02:46.290> LSD

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
going to do is take a base model non LSD

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.430 
going to do is take a base model non LSD
this<00:02:47.700> crossbows<00:02:48.180> have<00:02:48.390> open<00:02:48.810> disc<00:02:49.050> which

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
this crossbows have open disc which

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.640 
this crossbows have open disc which
means<00:02:49.709> is<00:02:49.890> uh<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:51.120> drive<00:02:51.420> shaft<00:02:51.750> spins<00:02:52.200> with

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
means is uh the drive shaft spins with

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.490 
means is uh the drive shaft spins with
only<00:02:52.770> one<00:02:53.040> wheel<00:02:53.250> spinning<00:02:53.840> and<00:02:54.840> as<00:02:55.290> you<00:02:55.380> can

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
only one wheel spinning and as you can

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.810 
only one wheel spinning and as you can
see<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.800> drive<00:02:56.010> shaft<00:02:56.280> is<00:02:56.400> spinning<00:02:56.459> right

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
see the drive shaft is spinning right

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.390 
see the drive shaft is spinning right
now<00:02:57.200> and<00:02:58.200> only<00:02:58.320> got<00:02:58.530> one<00:02:58.709> wheel<00:02:58.920> spinning<00:02:59.220> that

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
now and only got one wheel spinning that

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.800 
now and only got one wheel spinning that
wheel<00:02:59.580> right<00:02:59.760> there<00:02:59.940> is<00:03:00.030> not<00:03:00.150> spinning<00:03:00.420> I<00:03:00.630> got

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
wheel right there is not spinning I got

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.090 
wheel right there is not spinning I got
my<00:03:00.930> hand<00:03:01.140> on<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.320> wheel<00:03:01.470> that<00:03:01.500> is<00:03:01.739> spinning

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
my hand on the wheel that is spinning

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.490 
my hand on the wheel that is spinning
and<00:03:03.090> we're<00:03:03.180> gonna<00:03:03.300> change<00:03:03.570> that<00:03:03.810> base<00:03:04.050> model

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
and we're gonna change that base model

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.070 
and we're gonna change that base model
into<00:03:05.489> a<00:03:05.550> LSD<00:03:06.000> model<00:03:06.360> so<00:03:06.540> that<00:03:06.570> way<00:03:06.750> because

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
into a LSD model so that way because

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.860 
into a LSD model so that way because
that<00:03:07.860> drift<00:03:08.100> on<00:03:08.280> all<00:03:09.060> right<00:03:09.209> be<00:03:09.450> back<00:03:09.630> with<00:03:09.780> you

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
that drift on all right be back with you
