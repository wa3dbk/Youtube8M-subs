00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.190
 to see today we are going to plant the little plants 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:09.630
 from moringa 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:13.610
 as you will see they are in substrate 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.610
 us of special to root 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.080
 and now they have three months 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.080
 of life 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.349
 is going to plant 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.349
 a hole with technified irrigation system 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.730
 It is about 30 centimeters high 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.870
 they have made 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.290
 is going to surpass about 50 150 seedlings in 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:20.960
 rather unfavorable conditions there 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:24.110
 wind are sandy 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.590
 and we'll see how he reacts of about 15 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.590
 2010 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.280
 it is earth as a land of 2a 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.860
 he is very careful 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.070
 which is where you can best adapt 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:55.409
 now the little ball 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.409
 in the area of â€‹â€‹huacho climate 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.359
 we will be what 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.680
 although a seedling that is still in 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:11.690
 developing 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.690
 and another one that already has a good size 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.320
 and those are the dishes that we 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.320
 we provide 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.520
 like us
