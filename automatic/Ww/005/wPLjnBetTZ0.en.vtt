the<00:02:04.819> scale<00:02:05.210> of<00:02:05.569> the<00:02:05.780> sites<00:02:06.020> which<00:02:06.289> is<00:02:06.319> so

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
the scale of the sites which is so

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:07.179

and you can see the shape of your hair
yeah<00:03:09.730> they're<00:03:10.030> of<00:03:10.120> me<00:03:10.860> it's<00:03:11.860> very<00:03:11.950> interesting

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
yeah they're of me it's very interesting

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.009 
yeah they're of me it's very interesting
cause<00:03:12.430> it's<00:03:12.640> carved<00:03:12.910> the<00:03:13.120> same<00:03:13.330> on<00:03:13.540> both<00:03:13.720> on

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
cause it's carved the same on both on

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.750 
cause it's carved the same on both on
both<00:03:14.160> sides<00:03:16.830> human<00:03:17.830> remains<00:03:18.220> include<00:03:18.730> a

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
both sides human remains include a

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.120 
both sides human remains include a
fossilized<00:03:19.239> jaw<00:03:19.660> bone<00:03:19.989> and<00:03:20.019> vertebrae<00:03:20.769> and

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
fossilized jaw bone and vertebrae and

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.460 
fossilized jaw bone and vertebrae and
the<00:03:21.690> artifacts<00:03:22.690> show<00:03:22.989> that<00:03:23.200> these<00:03:23.410> people

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
the artifacts show that these people

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.920 
the artifacts show that these people
were<00:03:24.040> skilled<00:03:24.549> in<00:03:24.790> making<00:03:24.940> pottery<00:03:25.390> jewelry

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
were skilled in making pottery jewelry

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.880 
were skilled in making pottery jewelry
and<00:03:26.350> other<00:03:26.470> ornaments<00:03:28.530> this<00:03:29.530> seems<00:03:29.739> to<00:03:29.860> be

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
and other ornaments this seems to be

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.910 
and other ornaments this seems to be
most<00:03:30.459> like<00:03:30.580> turned<00:03:30.970> on<00:03:31.239> some<00:03:31.510> societies<00:03:32.200> it<00:03:32.739> is

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
most like turned on some societies it is

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.370 
most like turned on some societies it is
that<00:03:33.100> appears<00:03:33.850> to<00:03:33.940> be<00:03:34.060> a<00:03:34.090> very<00:03:34.690> good<00:03:34.810> artifact

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
that appears to be a very good artifact

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.970 
that appears to be a very good artifact
probably<00:03:36.220> they<00:03:36.400> had<00:03:36.610> a<00:03:36.640> sort<00:03:37.090> of<00:03:37.180> hang<00:03:37.569> their

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
probably they had a sort of hang their

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.680 
probably they had a sort of hang their
instrument<00:03:39.069> preparing<00:03:39.489> all<00:03:39.610> the<00:03:39.640> things<00:03:40.030> you

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
instrument preparing all the things you

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.039 
instrument preparing all the things you
see<00:03:41.670> also<00:03:42.670> they<00:03:42.850> are<00:03:42.880> made<00:03:42.970> through<00:03:43.390> that<00:03:43.630> and

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
see also they are made through that and

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.320 
see also they are made through that and
this<00:03:44.230> wall<00:03:44.440> runs<00:03:44.709> all<00:03:44.950> the<00:03:44.980> way<00:03:45.130> through

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
this wall runs all the way through

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.880 
this wall runs all the way through
completely<00:03:46.330> so<00:03:47.110> this<00:03:47.260> is<00:03:47.410> absolutely

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
completely so this is absolutely

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.430 
completely so this is absolutely
definitively<00:03:48.670> an<00:03:49.570> object<00:03:51.810> most<00:03:52.810> startling<00:03:53.230> of

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
definitively an object most startling of

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.770 
definitively an object most startling of
all<00:03:53.620> a<00:03:53.950> stone<00:03:54.459> slab<00:03:54.760> was<00:03:55.120> discovered<00:03:55.630> with

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
all a stone slab was discovered with

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.020 
all a stone slab was discovered with
raised<00:03:56.079> markings<00:03:56.440> which<00:03:57.010> could<00:03:57.400> push<00:03:57.790> back

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
raised markings which could push back

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.849 
raised markings which could push back
the<00:03:58.180> date<00:03:58.359> of<00:03:58.540> the<00:03:58.660> invention<00:03:58.900> of<00:03:59.170> writing<00:03:59.230> to

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859 
the date of the invention of writing to

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:03.270 
the date of the invention of writing to

this is building foundation foundation
and<00:04:23.229> you<00:04:23.410> can<00:04:23.620> see<00:04:23.800> that<00:04:23.979> they<00:04:24.130> are<00:04:24.160> very

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
and you can see that they are very

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:28.100 
and you can see that they are very
regularly<00:04:25.240> indeed<00:04:25.780> which<00:04:26.289> evolved<00:04:26.860> yet<00:04:27.070> walls

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
regularly indeed which evolved yet walls

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.779
