clean begins with the clean channel and
this<00:01:24.310> is<00:01:24.430> the<00:01:24.580> amp<00:01:24.729> by<00:01:25.030> itself<00:01:25.299> so<00:01:25.510> you<00:01:25.630> hear

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
this is the amp by itself so you hear

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:32.669 
this is the amp by itself so you hear
like<00:01:25.960> it's<00:01:26.110> pretty<00:01:26.320> clean<00:01:26.560> so<00:01:26.799> there's<00:01:26.950> no<00:01:31.679> and

00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:32.679 
like it's pretty clean so there's no and

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:34.139 
like it's pretty clean so there's no and
I'm<00:01:32.799> gonna<00:01:32.950> switch<00:01:33.159> on<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.429> blue<00:01:33.609> channel

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
I'm gonna switch on the blue channel

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:36.179 
I'm gonna switch on the blue channel
with<00:01:34.810> a<00:01:34.840> very<00:01:35.140> low<00:01:35.289> gain<00:01:35.530> setting<00:01:35.920> and<00:01:36.070> the

was<00:02:31.710> set<00:02:32.040> halfway<00:02:32.400> volumes<00:02:32.790> zero<00:02:33.060> so<00:02:33.180> I'll

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
was set halfway volumes zero so I'll

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:48.840 
was set halfway volumes zero so I'll
just<00:02:33.570> keep<00:02:33.690> this<00:02:33.840> in<00:02:33.900> for<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.170> second

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:03:03.920 

now<00:02:49.510> kicking<00:02:49.990> the<00:02:50.140> boost

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.490 

and<00:03:04.930> uh<00:03:05.349> I<00:03:05.970> will<00:03:06.970> crank<00:03:07.270> the<00:03:07.480> game<00:03:08.170> boots<00:03:08.410> to

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
and uh I will crank the game boots to

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.780 
and uh I will crank the game boots to
the<00:03:08.590> max<00:03:08.800> right<00:03:09.010> now<00:03:09.069> so<00:03:09.280> we<00:03:09.400> in<00:03:09.459> the<00:03:09.519> blue<00:03:09.670> in

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
the max right now so we in the blue in

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.160 
the max right now so we in the blue in
the<00:03:09.879> max<00:03:10.090> and<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.420> game<00:03:10.599> is<00:03:10.780> still<00:03:10.900> at<00:03:11.019> 1<00:03:11.140> o

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
the max and the game is still at 1 o

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:24.420 
the max and the game is still at 1 o
clock<00:03:11.260> so<00:03:11.650> that's<00:03:11.800> quite<00:03:12.250> a<00:03:12.310> bit<00:03:12.459> of<00:03:12.489> me<00:03:23.160> and<00:03:24.160> we

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
clock so that's quite a bit of me and we

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.540 
clock so that's quite a bit of me and we
go<00:03:24.550> straight<00:03:24.760> over<00:03:25.000> to<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.209> red<00:03:25.380> which<00:03:26.380> is

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
go straight over to the red which is

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.910 
go straight over to the red which is
which<00:03:27.550> almost<00:03:28.090> has<00:03:28.269> the<00:03:28.390> same<00:03:28.630> feature<00:03:28.930> set<00:03:29.080> in

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
which almost has the same feature set in

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.559 
which almost has the same feature set in
Headley<00:03:30.400> has<00:03:30.580> one<00:03:30.760> more<00:03:30.880> game<00:03:31.030> state<00:03:31.269> so<00:03:31.450> it

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
Headley has one more game state so it

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.240 
Headley has one more game state so it
starts<00:03:31.900> off<00:03:31.989> even<00:03:32.349> the<00:03:32.470> login<00:03:32.739> settings<00:03:32.950> with

a little more gain in the blue you can

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.589 
a little more gain in the blue you can
start<00:03:35.200> with<00:03:35.349> low<00:03:35.500> again<00:03:35.769> settings

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599

start with low again settings
starting<00:03:37.599> in<00:03:37.690> like<00:03:37.780> a<00:03:37.840> really<00:03:38.290> low<00:03:38.470> gain

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
starting in like a really low gain

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.280 
starting in like a really low gain
setting<00:03:38.920> right<00:03:39.040> now<00:03:39.099> and<00:03:40.110> the<00:03:41.110> only

now<00:04:56.960> we're<00:04:57.110> going<00:04:57.199> to<00:04:57.260> switch<00:04:57.380> on<00:04:57.590> the<00:04:57.680> b2

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
now we're going to switch on the b2

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.500 
now we're going to switch on the b2
which<00:04:58.340> kind<00:04:58.550> of<00:04:58.580> boosts<00:04:59.000> the<00:04:59.090> high<00:04:59.270> end<00:04:59.449> a

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
which kind of boosts the high end a

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:00.790 
which kind of boosts the high end a
little<00:04:59.600> bit<00:04:59.750> and<00:04:59.960> it<00:05:00.050> makes<00:05:00.199> it<00:05:00.320> a<00:05:00.350> little<00:05:00.680> bit

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
little bit and it makes it a little bit

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.890 
little bit and it makes it a little bit
tighter<00:05:01.040> -<00:05:01.340> and<00:05:01.580> it's<00:05:01.910> more<00:05:02.120> active<00:05:02.360> the

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
tighter - and it's more active the

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.300 
tighter - and it's more active the
pre-quiz<00:05:03.290> more<00:05:03.500> active<00:05:03.800> if<00:05:03.949> the<00:05:04.100> gain<00:05:04.280> is

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
pre-quiz more active if the gain is

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.920 
pre-quiz more active if the gain is
lower<00:05:04.699> so<00:05:04.790> right<00:05:05.000> now<00:05:05.090> it's<00:05:05.240> a<00:05:05.300> 12<00:05:05.510> o'clock<00:05:05.600> so

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
lower so right now it's a 12 o'clock so

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:17.620 
lower so right now it's a 12 o'clock so
you<00:05:05.990> should<00:05:06.169> hear<00:05:06.290> quite<00:05:06.530> a<00:05:06.560> bit<00:05:16.210> and<00:05:17.210> are<00:05:17.570> we

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
you should hear quite a bit and are we

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.000 
you should hear quite a bit and are we
going<00:05:17.780> to<00:05:17.840> kick<00:05:17.960> in<00:05:18.050> the<00:05:18.139> game<00:05:18.320> boards<00:05:18.770> the

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010 
going to kick in the game boards the

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.060 
going to kick in the game boards the
which<00:05:19.699> is<00:05:19.940> set<00:05:20.150> right<00:05:20.330> now<00:05:20.919> let's<00:05:21.919> actually

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
which is set right now let's actually

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.760 
which is set right now let's actually
crank<00:05:22.580> it<00:05:22.729> on<00:05:22.880> the<00:05:22.970> gain<00:05:23.180> and<00:05:23.479> the<00:05:24.380> volume

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
crank it on the gain and the volume

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:39.970 
crank it on the gain and the volume
we're<00:05:25.040> gonna<00:05:25.160> leave<00:05:25.400> it<00:05:25.550> zero<00:05:25.910> so<00:05:26.870> that's<00:05:27.680> one

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:39.980 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.120 

so<00:05:40.790> this<00:05:41.360> concludes<00:05:41.840> pretty<00:05:42.350> much<00:05:42.470> our<00:05:42.710> quick

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
so this concludes pretty much our quick

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.060 
so this concludes pretty much our quick
