00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 and now one of them actually comes for 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.490
 these two relegation games at all 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.700
 was no longer provided 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.849
 toni sailer these are not real ones yet 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.330
 I think hair will grow real like that 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.870
 lots 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.880
 that is only enough for a wig 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.770
 but they were just in a first 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.119
 reaction a bit different than what 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.990
 Now the idea that has something with 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.119
 to do carnival 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.330
 they really have, if I say so 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.150
 may warned from deepest soul what went 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.540
 in the ford yes I do not know what 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.930
 The tears must be completely empty 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.350
 Come with joy because I am now 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.550
 the fourth year in a row or three years 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.510
 in succession at the third place over 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.010
 I look very much now 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.469
 managed and then such a game too 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.500
 experience after the game of chance 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:51.050
 I can not believe it and that 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.550
 are only the tears come easy 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.809
 can they somehow grasp that? 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.699
 what you do with this team in the 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.660
 last years have done here resp 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.699
 for singing in the last year 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.809
 I can not believe it so I 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.080
 knew from the beginning that we were one 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.460
 crazy bunch are and should we 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.330
 I've risen in the olymp of the 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.490
 Crazy broken the mentally ill 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.049
 and it's getting harder and harder 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.040
 express what is so crazy 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.229
 otherwise no spirit that this 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.990
 Team I think that has curiosity in it 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.700
 The 120 minutes we saw that 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.340
 we are totally crazy that we 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.060
 drive up and shoot four goals 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.220
 nobody thought except myself and yes 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.780
 this is unbeliveable 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.490
 now it is so the team 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.900
 first so at least the remains together 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.820
 stammelf in the past season 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.409
 played again and again has to count 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.000
 Of course they also with which 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.860
 expectations even if it is already very far 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.460
 is preceded by go in now 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.720
 the second league for us just about the 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.670
 to go to class we have to look 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.430
 that we might still have the one or the other 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.960
 get one or the other player 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.729
 but that is the task of the trainer and 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.810
 Presidium and manager and if that already 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.430
 do well who that this 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.630
 transition made and 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.550
 we have no mistakes this year 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.750
 Do not do any at all 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.190
 they do not have and leave today 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.520
 is with a wig and now it will be 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.229
 bad 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.200
 I thought at least now I have you 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.050
 so angel the congenial storm partner of 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.700
 marco sailer yes and he also wants to say 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.990
 I might again then greet my 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.430
 brother all my friends 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.430
