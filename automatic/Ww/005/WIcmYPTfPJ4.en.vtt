after<00:00:05.549> I've<00:00:05.670> created<00:00:05.940> the<00:00:06.210> Center<00:00:06.420> for<00:00:06.600> my

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
after I've created the Center for my

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.720 
after I've created the Center for my
tulip<00:00:07.259> I'm<00:00:07.410> ready<00:00:07.620> to<00:00:07.830> make<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.130> petals<00:00:08.519> I

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
tulip I'm ready to make the petals I

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.060 
tulip I'm ready to make the petals I
rolled<00:00:09.389> out<00:00:09.630> gum<00:00:09.900> paste<00:00:10.170> and<00:00:10.500> have<00:00:10.530> cut<00:00:10.950> it

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
rolled out gum paste and have cut it

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.160 
rolled out gum paste and have cut it
with<00:00:11.219> a<00:00:11.250> three<00:00:11.580> petal<00:00:11.849> cutter<00:00:12.240> I'm<00:00:12.719> going<00:00:13.019> to

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
with a three petal cutter I'm going to

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.499 
with a three petal cutter I'm going to
though<00:00:13.349> use<00:00:13.769> these<00:00:14.009> petals<00:00:14.360> individually<00:00:15.360> so

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
though use these petals individually so

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.810 
though use these petals individually so
I<00:00:15.570> need<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.839> separate<00:00:16.410> each<00:00:16.890> of<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.580> petals

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
I need to separate each of the petals

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.970 
I need to separate each of the petals
from<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.600> other<00:00:18.960> ones<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.500> I'll<00:00:19.590> just<00:00:19.770> use

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
from the other ones and I'll just use

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.250 
from the other ones and I'll just use
one<00:00:20.220> at<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.460> time<00:00:20.699> you<00:00:21.180> store<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.750> other<00:00:21.930> ones

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
one at a time you store the other ones

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.439 
one at a time you store the other ones
underneath<00:00:22.769> my<00:00:23.160> plastic<00:00:23.640> cell<00:00:23.880> flops<00:00:24.150> so<00:00:24.240> that

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
underneath my plastic cell flops so that

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.900 
underneath my plastic cell flops so that
they<00:00:24.570> don't<00:00:24.810> dry<00:00:24.960> out<00:00:25.439> in<00:00:26.160> order<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.670> create

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
they don't dry out in order to create

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.089 
they don't dry out in order to create
this<00:00:27.150> petal<00:00:27.599> I'm<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.869> nice<00:00:28.080> petal<00:00:28.529> shape<00:00:28.800> here

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
this petal I'm a nice petal shape here

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.429 
this petal I'm a nice petal shape here
when<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.490> tuck<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.150> very<00:00:30.359> bottom<00:00:30.810> just<00:00:31.019> fold<00:00:31.289> it

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
when I tuck the very bottom just fold it

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.459 
when I tuck the very bottom just fold it
over<00:00:31.560> just<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:32.099> hide<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.910> raw<00:00:33.239> edge<00:00:33.480> each<00:00:34.170> of

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
over just to hide that raw edge each of

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.959 
over just to hide that raw edge each of
the<00:00:34.590> petals<00:00:35.010> on<00:00:35.190> this<00:00:35.399> layer<00:00:35.730> are

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
the petals on this layer are

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.350 
the petals on this layer are
individually<00:00:36.870> wired<00:00:37.140> so<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.559> take<00:00:37.860> my<00:00:38.070> wire<00:00:38.910> dip

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
individually wired so I take my wire dip

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.060 
individually wired so I take my wire dip
it<00:00:39.480> into<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.750> little<00:00:39.809> bit<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.140> edible<00:00:40.620> glue<00:00:40.860> and

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
it into a little bit of edible glue and

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.060 
it into a little bit of edible glue and
brush<00:00:41.520> off<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:42.180> excess<00:00:42.629> I'm<00:00:43.440> going<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.680> insert

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
brush off the excess I'm going to insert

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.670 
brush off the excess I'm going to insert
the<00:00:44.129> wire<00:00:44.489> in<00:00:44.850> between<00:00:45.719> my<00:00:45.899> two<00:00:45.960> fingers<00:00:46.230> just

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
the wire in between my two fingers just

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.770 
the wire in between my two fingers just
about<00:00:47.190> an<00:00:47.340> eighth<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.700> an<00:00:47.850> inch<00:00:48.000> it's<00:00:48.300> not<00:00:48.510> very

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
about an eighth of an inch it's not very

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.310 
about an eighth of an inch it's not very
far<00:00:49.110> at<00:00:49.379> all<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.920> then<00:00:50.399> I'll<00:00:50.550> tailor<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.750> gum

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
far at all and then I'll tailor the gum

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.830 
far at all and then I'll tailor the gum
paste<00:00:52.559> back<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.699> wire<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.270> should<00:00:54.629> at

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
paste back to the wire so it should at

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.479 
paste back to the wire so it should at
this<00:00:55.199> point<00:00:55.320> kind<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.829> look<00:00:56.010> like<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.219> balloon

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
this point kind of look like a balloon

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.599 
this point kind of look like a balloon
on<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.030> stick<00:00:57.570> now<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.800> believe<00:00:59.190> in<00:00:59.370> creating

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
on a stick now I believe in creating

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.959 
on a stick now I believe in creating
super<00:01:00.390> thin<00:01:00.840> petal<00:01:01.260> edges<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.550> technique

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
super thin petal edges so the technique

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.450 
super thin petal edges so the technique
that<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.210> use<00:01:03.539> as<00:01:03.750> if<00:01:04.110> I'm<00:01:04.350> snapping<00:01:05.010> I'm<00:01:05.309> going

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
that I use as if I'm snapping I'm going

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.940 
that I use as if I'm snapping I'm going
to<00:01:05.549> pinch<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.330> roll<00:01:06.600> pinch<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.530> roll<00:01:07.799> the

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
to pinch and roll pinch and roll the

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.850 
to pinch and roll pinch and roll the
edges<00:01:08.130> before<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:09.119> do<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.600> put<00:01:10.049> some<00:01:10.229> powdered

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
edges before I do that put some powdered

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.760 
edges before I do that put some powdered
sugar<00:01:10.890> onto<00:01:11.520> my<00:01:12.299> fingertips<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:13.110> pinch<00:01:13.439> and

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
sugar onto my fingertips to pinch and

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.289 
sugar onto my fingertips to pinch and
roll<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.010> edges<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.490> make<00:01:14.549> sure<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.150> my

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
roll the edges and make sure that my

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.260 
roll the edges and make sure that my
fingers<00:01:15.689> don't<00:01:15.990> stick<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:17.280> my<00:01:17.580> petal<00:01:18.060> as<00:01:18.210> I

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
fingers don't stick to my petal as I

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.630 
fingers don't stick to my petal as I
work<00:01:18.659> all<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.259> way<00:01:19.290> around<00:01:19.409> what<00:01:20.250> this<00:01:20.400> is

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
work all the way around what this is

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.850 
work all the way around what this is
doing<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.150> thinning<00:01:21.600> out<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.750> edges<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.530> it's

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
doing is thinning out the edges and it's

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.340 
doing is thinning out the edges and it's
also<00:01:23.100> distorting<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.240> perfectly<00:01:25.110> cut

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
also distorting that perfectly cut

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.870 
also distorting that perfectly cut
shaped<00:01:25.740> nothing<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.280> nature's<00:01:26.640> ever

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
shaped nothing in nature's ever

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.450 
shaped nothing in nature's ever
perfectly<00:01:27.689> round<00:01:27.990> I'll<00:01:28.409> take<00:01:28.799> my<00:01:28.950> petal<00:01:29.250> turn

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
perfectly round I'll take my petal turn

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.050 
perfectly round I'll take my petal turn

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
little bit again to thin out the edges a

widen<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.600> petal<00:01:52.020> now<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.350> also<00:01:52.680> want<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.130> get

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
widen the petal now I also want to get

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.010 
widen the petal now I also want to get
some<00:01:53.520> veins<00:01:53.729> on<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.030> back<00:01:54.360> so<00:01:54.570> I'll<00:01:54.659> take<00:01:54.869> the

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
some veins on the back so I'll take the

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.679 
some veins on the back so I'll take the
same<00:01:55.500> Vayner<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.189> press<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.090> in<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.450> want<00:01:57.630> to

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
same Vayner and press it in I want to

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.080 
same Vayner and press it in I want to
make<00:01:57.750> sure<00:01:57.899> that<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:59.100> line<00:01:59.700> that's<00:02:00.000> running

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
make sure that the line that's running

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.690 
make sure that the line that's running
through<00:02:00.540> my<00:02:00.659> veins<00:02:00.689> lines<00:02:01.500> up<00:02:01.799> with<00:02:02.100> where<00:02:02.460> my

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
through my veins lines up with where my

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.410 
through my veins lines up with where my
wire<00:02:03.030> is<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.840> can<00:02:04.259> press<00:02:04.619> on<00:02:04.950> my<00:02:05.700> Vayner<00:02:06.030> and

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
wire is I can press on my Vayner and

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.749 
wire is I can press on my Vayner and
that<00:02:06.899> should<00:02:07.170> give<00:02:07.350> me<00:02:07.380> texture<00:02:08.099> onto<00:02:08.520> both

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
that should give me texture onto both

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.740 
that should give me texture onto both
sides<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:09.450> my

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
sides of my

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.100 
sides of my
Adam<00:02:10.100> carefully<00:02:11.100> peeling<00:02:11.460> this<00:02:11.760> off<00:02:12.000> now<00:02:12.690> if<00:02:12.990> I

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
Adam carefully peeling this off now if I

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.780 
Adam carefully peeling this off now if I
were<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.260> leave<00:02:13.500> this<00:02:13.710> pedo<00:02:13.980> in<00:02:14.160> my<00:02:14.310> hand<00:02:14.580> to

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
were to leave this pedo in my hand to

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.240 
were to leave this pedo in my hand to
dry<00:02:15.060> overnight<00:02:15.480> it<00:02:15.780> would<00:02:15.900> dry<00:02:16.140> flat<00:02:16.530> petals

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
dry overnight it would dry flat petals

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.700 
dry overnight it would dry flat petals
in<00:02:17.400> nature<00:02:17.730> are<00:02:17.910> not<00:02:18.150> flat<00:02:18.570> so<00:02:19.020> I<00:02:19.050> want<00:02:19.350> to<00:02:19.560> give

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
in nature are not flat so I want to give

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.470 
in nature are not flat so I want to give
it<00:02:19.830> a<00:02:19.920> little<00:02:20.070> bit<00:02:20.280> of<00:02:20.430> movement<00:02:20.700> I'm<00:02:21.240> going<00:02:21.420> to

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
it a little bit of movement I'm going to

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.590 
it a little bit of movement I'm going to
place<00:02:21.750> it<00:02:21.930> in<00:02:22.020> a<00:02:22.140> spoon<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.830> dry<00:02:23.160> overnight<00:02:24.150> and

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
place it in a spoon to dry overnight and

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.449 
place it in a spoon to dry overnight and
that<00:02:24.930> will<00:02:25.080> allow<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.440> petal<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:25.890> be<00:02:26.100> curved

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
that will allow the petal to be curved

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.280 
that will allow the petal to be curved
both<00:02:26.610> front<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.090> back<00:02:27.240> and<00:02:27.480> left<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.230> right

for my tulip I need three of these

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.830 
for my tulip I need three of these
petals<00:02:31.890> that<00:02:32.160> are<00:02:32.280> wired<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:33.030> then<00:02:33.420> dried<00:02:33.810> in

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
petals that are wired and then dried in

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.590 
petals that are wired and then dried in
smooth<00:02:34.530> and<00:02:34.860> then<00:02:35.280> they'll<00:02:35.730> dry<00:02:36.060> overnight

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
smooth and then they'll dry overnight

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.870 
smooth and then they'll dry overnight
I'll<00:02:37.020> be<00:02:37.380> ready<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:37.740> add<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.250> next<00:02:38.459> layer<00:02:38.580> of

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
I'll be ready to add the next layer of

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.720 
I'll be ready to add the next layer of
