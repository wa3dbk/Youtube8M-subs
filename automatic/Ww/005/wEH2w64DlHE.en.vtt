00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.060
 in the venice channels 

00:00:07.989 --> 00:00:11.219
 just like I like to come here where rocket 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.259
 it's the perfect place to splash 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:17.740
 I do not think I should be in that kind of position 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.740
 when there is no care sir 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:22.689
 nothing happens here 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.689
 neither you nor trucks in many of the statements 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.570
 I'm telling you 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.570
 some of the broken dishes 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.770
 so said 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.420
 I never thought I was going to need pictures 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.420
 to be able to practice argentina 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.140
 you knew there is an attack where people worry if the streets do not 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.130
 they have water 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.360
 Likewise 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.470
 On the north coast of Italy was beautiful city of Venice 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.040
 here the canals are the streets there are no other vehicles in the city 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.120
 through the channels it was transported throughout the month 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.120
 and what happened to the streets that maybe there was a flood 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.340
 no friend the channels have always been here 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.080
 but I better tell you something about the history of Venice and its channels 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.040
 1,500 years ago the Roman Empire was taught by barbarians who came from 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.040
 north 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:25.710
 to escape 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.420
 a group of t 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.420
 the objective 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.470
 they had the happy couple of 3 717 islands did not pose without planes at about three 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.900
 kilometers from the coast 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.990
 these small islands were separated by a few years young channel 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.700
 the channels now 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.980
 before criticizing their homes 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.780
 the inhabitants had to cover many products 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.220
 to track foot 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.070
 soon the small ones and their son began to populate a fisherman 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.250
 in a few hundred years 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.250
 letizia became one of them appointment 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.380
 and between the 13th and 15th centuries venice became one of the most important 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.859
 cities of europe 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:18.749
 Many famous artists and writers have received in Venice 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:22.969
 but although the city keeps great artistic treasures its greatest attraction 

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:27.919
 are the ones that analyzed, I would like to know more closely after winning the 

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:30.679
 career to work 

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:33.679
 I think they deserve to be that many do not 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.729
 friend the goalie breaks while he spoke badly of others 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.209
 country 117 different channels 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.909
 with a total length of 45 kilometers today the information by messages like this 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:49.839
 now you are in the greatest 

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:52.299
 they call it the big channel 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.119
 has the safe way and will be reversed 

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:58.119
 i is about three kilometers 

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:01.999
 my son away is to say that it is double ring 

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:04.999
 on average it is about 15 meters wide and three meters deep 

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:09.829
 Well, it descends bigger and you would like to know something about the 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:10.549
 bridges 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.549
 what bridges 

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:16.089
 just passed 

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:17.259
 sorry 

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:21.849
 you almost went under one of the 4 5 million pesos to the canaries 

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:23.819
 but you are lucky 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.439
 the channels that they are not very deep 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:29.930
 Well, it's a good luck because look how it is today but look where 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.759
 I came to a barbershop 

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:33.879
 no friends 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:36.899
 while the family that lives here moors their boat 

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:41.479
 well, if I can not give myself pentolite, let's go ahead 

00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:45.269
 vallÃ­n 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.679
 service management report 

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:51.699
 now it is supporting one with the most famous transportation of venice 

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:53.959
 the CD 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.579
 firefighters can maneuver the ministry because you have to add almost a 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.509
 weight more than 600 kilograms 

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:02.399
 the second of the prisoners more 

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:06.529
 all the communes are built and which with five types of mate 

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:10.619
 nor how fast are they 

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:14.579
 the speed limit is about eight kilometers per hour although some do not 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.639
 exceed 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.769
 and unprecedented 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.870
 there are almost never collisions 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.870
 both of them 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.690
 because if not, the water in the channels always has 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.370
 the same depth 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.689
 then the mother to the track a lot 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:38.349
 Mary the tides are caused by the gravity force of the moon that attracts 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:39.879
 to the water of the earth 

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:42.830
 rise when the attraction is greater 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.840
 and low when it is lower 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.069
 today I support I think it will cooperate 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:52.069
 The firm hand went down a lot 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.960
 Good thing he came back to the wood for wanting to compare me, he promised to show me 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.479
 row 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:03.699
 but first pyramidal 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:06.339
 like that to clean the channels 

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:09.559
 the wood takes most of the garbage 

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:14.339
 nevertheless every 10 or 20 years each channel of Mexicans and so that it can be 

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:16.110
 clean 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.559
 today that does not raise do not tell me they are drying 

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:20.629
 the pact 

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:23.629
 I think it's very bad luck with the album 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:28.409
 I have bad luck with it because there is no young water 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.120
 we seem to have a new control of venice 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.999
 Yes sir and it seems that they do not eat it, maybe I'll take the job 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:51.849
 all my daughter 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:53.400
 float through the channels 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.869
 ps told me 'because he is father 

00:05:55.869 --> 00:05:59.219
 but I do not like to explode in sport because I am not past 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.050
 my tactics pacari beginning when I got married by burying my nails
