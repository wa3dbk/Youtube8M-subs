00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.840
 yes 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.330
 the promised debt there is another house 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.070
 kitchen are the favorite covers the 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.959
 people who know me for sure has 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.539
 touched one more than once because I 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:16.100
 love to see them parties are the nachos not 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:18.710
 they are the typical cheese nachos 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.740
 yellows and affection and no longer these are the 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.780
 full meal that bears beans and that 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.760
 cream and other things and I 'm going to 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:29.090
 say very easy to do it does not take long 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.820
 15 minutes very good it seems like a game 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.410
 Sunday a movie a boxed meeting 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.510
 or if you have to take the snack in a 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.699
 party do not arrive with the typical bag of 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.480
 potatoes compared to this are going to stay 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:40.760
 Super good 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.640
 - Talking tension, let's start with the 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.530
 recipe first is the first thing we're going to 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.719
 start making a pico de gallo sauce 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.329
 sure they already know how to do it but I 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:54.109
 I say how for this we need tomato 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:56.300
 onion chili and cilantro all this 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:58.750
 chopped in pictures of chili cilantro what 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.900
 more finite possible 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:05.770
 At the end we counted all months and washed 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:08.159
 we add so much salt and reserve for the 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.249
 as long as it is needed 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.710
 the next step is the meat I use 

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:15.749
 of beef in pieces can be moved as 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.939
 you want I like frying 

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:19.770
 with a little onion and garlic for this 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.020
 we need to heat our cardboard 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.090
 first we wait for it to warm up for 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.570
 put the oil there first the 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.630
 onion 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:32.390
 we let it get cold just a little 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.890
 then the garlic without burning is very 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.770
 important 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.659
 then the meat is moved so that it 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.550
 start cooking and we leave it there 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.880
 depending on the term that the 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.880
 want 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.240
 while the meat is there I explain what 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.920
 of the cheese can use the cheese that 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.600
 you want as long as you 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.290
 gratina I am using a 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.790
 combination of chihuahua with manchego 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.410
 we could put it to au gratin in the oven 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.420
 with the chips but who is going to light 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.610
 the oven for this the easiest thing is 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.619
 do it in the micro we add so much 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.929
 milk so that it is a little more liquid 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.399
 and I do not know what I proposed mine one minute 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.590
 but everything depends on the quantities 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.220
 leave a little bit so that you do not 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.860
 I will burn them 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.400
 and this is how it is gratified, 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.400
 we are going to occupy 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.050
 we return to our flesh she must 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.970
 to be more cooked is quite the wine 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.250
 that I like the middle term so 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.820
 I'll put the salt if they want the same 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.820
 Pepper 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.689
 and in the end I like to add here 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.730
 already cooked beans can be 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:42.400
 Peruvians of the type you want 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.109
 refritos if you do not want to do them because 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.540
 he gives them a game for anything 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:48.819
 they can buy a fondita as the last 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.650
 option I would put those of the cough the 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.480
 we left there for a while and turned off the 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.930
 fire and we are already preparing for 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.260
 present for this we are going to need 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.989
 chopped onion rabbits chopped 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.120
 canned jalapenos also fresh these 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:08.859
 are optional depending on how much they 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.840
 like chile and not something Burgos salt and 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:12.970
 cream to have more control of the 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.950
 cream and not take the spoon because it 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.950
 you see worse they can put it in a bag of 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.139
 plastic make a little eye because with this 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.700
 pass me by and use it as a manga type of 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:24.430
 those that the confectioners use for 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.980
 decorate now yes we are ready to 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.760
 present and we start with the main thing 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:34.980
 that are the totopos after the meat with 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.980
 the mixed kalish beans 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.530
 the melted cheese 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.970
 the pico de gallo sauce that we do not know 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:51.390
 forget all this is to taste 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.390
 jalapeño cream in vinegar 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:58.150
 fresh jalapeños 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.580
 and as a final touch the rolls of 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.590
 onion to this recipe can without 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.510
 problems removing or adding the 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.340
 ingredients that I want, I'm going to 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.940

 dietetics we will go up as 2 kilos 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:20.840
 but it 's worth it because they are delicious 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.940

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.730
