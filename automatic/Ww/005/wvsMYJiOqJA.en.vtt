 most extraordinary tubers there are

 tryptophan is an amino acid that 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.390
 our body needs to form the 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.149
 called brain neurotransmitters 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.890
 which are dopamine serotonin and 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.229
 all neurotransmitters play a 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.590
 very important role in the function 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:45.500
 cerebral because it has to do with the 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:48.950

 men who consumed potatoes 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.670
 that's why it's important that children 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.510
 starting at 6 months mothers 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.610

 duck sirirÃ­ and ducks and there are two 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.100
 substances that play a very important role 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.740
 important because they are protective of 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.700
 infectious diseases of type 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:41.910
 bacterial and fungal type considered 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.820

 sweet potato to a person who has problems 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:52.260
 diabetics there is a job that came out in 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.450
 the journal diabetes care in 2004 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.400
 they brought a job 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:01.890
 that you buy diabetic people were 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.650
 that person was given a diet that 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.680
 it contained sweet potato and another group of people 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.110
 diabetic was not given the sweet potato that 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.730
 they found they found 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.069
 that diabetic people who 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.980
 they consumed the sweet potato they had better 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:19.800
 control of sugar levels in your 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.930

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.890
 the levels of fat in your blood 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.500
 understand cholesterol says it is 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.900
 important the consumption of potatoes in 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:34.769
 pregnant because this product 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.720
 contains folic acid because today already 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.940
 knows the science that when a woman 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.430
 pregnant previously before her 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.190
 pregnancy consumes folic acid can 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.829
 prevents the formation of children with 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:50.220
 brain defects for example a child 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:53.069
 with head without head children with 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.850
 problems the column also says that 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:58.570
 folic acid 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:00.910
 to control other evils but also 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.050
 It has been proven that the lack of acid 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.960
 Folic acid can lead to 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.880
 the cleft lip formation then 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.580
 a pregnant woman suit you the 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.490
 sweet potato consumption for two reasons 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.890
 first because a big one by all 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.200
 The nutrients it contains are excellent 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.750
 because it contains a lot of fiber and 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.389
 pregnant women are prone 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.449
 to constipation 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:27.939
 and because iron has another power that 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:31.009
 according to the doctor has the sweet potato is that 

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:33.710
 can fight anemia 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:36.199
 in fact in the world the cause more 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.210
 frequent anemia deficiency 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.580
 lack of iron we have the sweet potato that 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.490
 contains iron 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.350
 in addition the sweet potato contains another acid 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.459
 important 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:50.289
 pantothenic acid is important for 

00:04:47.459 --> 00:04:52.509
 vitamin B5 because they have to do with the 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:54.750
 formation of neurotransmitters 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:57.420
 brain 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:00.360
 it is a stimulates the formation of 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:03.060
 antibodies that is the defense of 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.730
 our body also contains niacin 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.970
 which is important for the care of the 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:11.520
 even born skin is used today 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.190
 day to decrease the levels of 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:17.910
 cholesterol and especially niacin 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.740
 It also stimulates good circulation 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.170
 in the blood 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:25.170
 and precisely insists that for his 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:29.130
 great component the potato in addition to 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:33.330
 nutritional is medicinal as we say is 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:36.510
 a good Dominican the sweet potato serves up 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:39.450
 for remedy according to the doctor the sweet potato 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:41.430
 It must be consumed by people who 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.810
 suffer from cancer because their 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:47.260
 components benefit 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:49.440
 those affected by this terrible evil the 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:53.290
 reason is that it has a good content of 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:56.080
 beta carotene has vitamin c contains 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:58.630
 folic acid folic acid is a 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.590
 repairman of a structure of the 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:03.639
 human chromosomes which is the the acid 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:07.690
 deoxyribonucleic so that 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:12.639
 understand a word a person changes 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:15.400
 Your new body tissue is excellent 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:18.040
 because in addition to folic acid it contains 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:21.010
 a number of minerals that help 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:24.700
 fight cancer for example one of 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:28.090
 they are selenium the excellent selenium 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:31.360
 it contains the sweet potato has also the 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:35.380
 zinc and argues that also the sweet potato 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:37.720
 It contains a special protein called 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:41.470
 espora minsk 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:44.050
 he is a devourer of 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:46.050
 heavy metals when it is introduced into 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:50.650
 our body understands that mercury 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:53.470
 you understand the lead in 2005 a 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:55.990
 American magazine published that the 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:59.410
 Asians have an incidence of 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:04.570
 very low kidney cancer with respect to 

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:07.330
 other populations and he blames that that 

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:10.600
 decrease is because they are large 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:12.880
 sweet potato consumers also holds 

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.520

 intestines that already people who have 

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:23.650
 processes of inflammation of the colon or that 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:26.590
 at a given moment they are affected by a 

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:28.870
 it is worth to affect the colon because the sweet potato 

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:30.790
 helps the recovery of Tangier 

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:32.560
 medium because it has great power 

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:34.689
 anti-inflammatory not only at the level of 

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:37.029
 intestine but 

00:07:34.689 --> 00:07:38.860
 of brain tissue by power 

00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:42.249
 curative of this product 

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:44.079
 the doctor invites kun 

00:07:42.249 --> 00:07:45.699
 we are talking about sweet potato but what 

00:07:44.079 --> 00:07:48.609
 Cuban knows him by the name of 

00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:51.579

00:08:00.969 --> 00:08:03.179
 sweet 

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:13.590
 I hope that after this the 

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:16.430
 sweet potato do not miss the diet of the 

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:16.430
