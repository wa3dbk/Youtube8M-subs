the<00:01:01.629> logic<00:01:01.840> board<00:01:02.199> appears<00:01:02.649> to<00:01:02.800> be<00:01:02.920> fastened

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
the logic board appears to be fastened

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:10.660 
the logic board appears to be fastened
by<00:01:03.550> a<00:01:03.699> little<00:01:04.360> plastic<00:01:07.170> thing<00:01:08.170> here

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.060 

and<00:01:11.409> here<00:01:12.520> seems<00:01:13.520> to<00:01:14.560> sort<00:01:15.560> of<00:01:15.650> kind<00:01:15.830> of<00:01:15.950> like

slightly holding weapon on the side of

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.660 
slightly holding weapon on the side of
that<00:01:18.710> so<00:01:19.220> that<00:01:19.960> it's<00:01:20.960> secure<00:01:21.350> and<00:01:21.649> snug<00:01:21.890> here

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
that so that it's secure and snug here

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.870 
that so that it's secure and snug here
and<00:01:22.939> here<00:01:24.159> so<00:01:25.159> I'm<00:01:25.250> going<00:01:25.399> to<00:01:25.460> hear<00:01:25.549> how<00:01:25.700> many

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
and here so I'm going to hear how many

00:01:25.880 --> 00:02:26.670 
and here so I'm going to hear how many
get<00:01:26.000> past<00:01:26.270> that

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.920 

hey<00:02:27.340> I<00:02:27.370> just<00:02:27.579> discovered<00:02:28.299> putting<00:02:28.689> some

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
hey I just discovered putting some

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.459 
hey I just discovered putting some
pressure<00:02:29.560> on<00:02:29.859> the<00:02:30.159> glass<00:02:30.400> actually<00:02:30.819> helps<00:02:31.469> to

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:32.469 
pressure on the glass actually helps to

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:34.920 
pressure on the glass actually helps to
loosen<00:02:32.650> this<00:02:33.099> part<00:02:33.489> so<00:02:33.790> i<00:02:33.849> i'm<00:02:34.299> going<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:34.810> try

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
loosen this part so i i'm going to try

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:53.410 
loosen this part so i i'm going to try
that

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.530 

I<00:02:53.480> am<00:02:54.440> still<00:02:54.770> perplexed

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.039 

I'm<00:02:58.140> still<00:02:58.769> wondering<00:02:59.549> hot<00:03:00.180> in<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.450> world<00:03:00.719> am

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
I'm still wondering hot in the world am

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:06.880 
I'm still wondering hot in the world am
I<00:03:01.170> gonna<00:03:01.319> loosen<00:03:01.620> this

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:14.420 

Oh<00:03:08.440> something<00:03:09.440> just<00:03:09.650> gave<00:03:11.140> what<00:03:12.140> was<00:03:12.319> it

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
Oh something just gave what was it

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.530 
Oh something just gave what was it
appears<00:03:15.299> to<00:03:15.390> be<00:03:15.540> good<00:03:15.900> news<00:03:16.109> it's<00:03:16.560> loosening

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
appears to be good news it's loosening

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:24.440 
appears to be good news it's loosening
so<00:03:20.060> that's<00:03:21.060> good<00:03:21.540> I<00:03:22.760> don't<00:03:23.760> want<00:03:23.879> to<00:03:23.939> break<00:03:24.209> any

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
so that's good I don't want to break any

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.110 
so that's good I don't want to break any
fragile<00:03:25.349> little<00:03:25.500> connections<00:03:28.579> like<00:03:29.579> that<00:03:29.640> one

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
fragile little connections like that one

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.629 
fragile little connections like that one
right<00:03:30.329> there<00:03:30.989> looks<00:03:31.680> like<00:03:31.799> a<00:03:31.889> little<00:03:32.129> wire

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
right there looks like a little wire

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.449 
right there looks like a little wire
connecting<00:03:33.269> this<00:03:34.010> there's<00:03:35.010> a<00:03:35.069> little<00:03:35.280> wire

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
connecting this there's a little wire

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.599 
connecting this there's a little wire
can<00:03:35.700> I<00:03:35.790> think<00:03:36.030> this<00:03:36.329> to<00:03:37.290> that<00:03:37.500> don't<00:03:38.370> want<00:03:38.489> to

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
can I think this to that don't want to

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.330 
can I think this to that don't want to
sever<00:03:38.879> that<00:03:39.650> we<00:03:40.650> notice<00:03:40.859> how<00:03:41.010> you're<00:03:41.159> going<00:03:41.250> to

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
sever that we notice how you're going to

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.960 
sever that we notice how you're going to
repair<00:03:41.639> that<00:03:41.790> if<00:03:41.909> you<00:03:42.030> break<00:03:42.450> that<00:03:45.319> no<00:03:46.970> there's

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
repair that if you break that no there's

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:55.250 
repair that if you break that no there's
another<00:03:51.079> side<00:03:52.079> to<00:03:52.280> unclassy

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
another side to unclassy

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.149 
another side to unclassy
this<00:03:55.920> sides<00:03:56.159> unfastened<00:03:56.849> this<00:03:56.970> slide<00:03:57.180> is<00:03:57.390> not

00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 
this sides unfastened this slide is not

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:02.690 
this sides unfastened this slide is not
so

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:57.279 

let's<00:04:03.420> try<00:04:03.750> and<00:04:04.020> gently<00:04:04.470> pry<00:04:07.550> until

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:57.289 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.879 

oh<00:04:58.599> my<00:04:59.599> goodness

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
oh my goodness

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:10.439 
oh my goodness
for<00:05:02.490> a<00:05:02.520> second<00:05:02.999> there<00:05:03.060> I<00:05:03.270> thought<00:05:03.870> a<00:05:04.110> broken

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:10.449 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:12.869 

and<00:05:10.599> I<00:05:11.499> also<00:05:11.680> just<00:05:11.830> noticed<00:05:12.129> something<00:05:12.400> really

00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:12.879 
and I also just noticed something really

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:17.219 
and I also just noticed something really
really<00:05:12.999> important<00:05:16.110> remember<00:05:17.110> that

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:17.229 
really important remember that

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:19.920 
really important remember that
connection<00:05:17.710> that<00:05:17.919> I<00:05:17.949> was<00:05:18.539> trying<00:05:19.539> not<00:05:19.749> to

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
connection that I was trying not to

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:27.890 
connection that I was trying not to
sever<00:05:21.960> well

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.600 

can<00:05:28.470> you<00:05:28.560> look<00:05:28.680> carefully

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.290 

it<00:05:32.180> appears<00:05:32.479> I<00:05:32.629> did<00:05:32.870> separate<00:05:33.319> a<00:05:33.909> little<00:05:34.909> wire

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
it appears I did separate a little wire

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.450 
it appears I did separate a little wire
right<00:05:35.569> there<00:05:37.060> that<00:05:38.060> one<00:05:38.889> right<00:05:39.889> there<00:05:39.949> that

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
right there that one right there that

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.499 
right there that one right there that
little<00:05:40.520> wire<00:05:40.879> it<00:05:41.240> suffered<00:05:42.520> but<00:05:43.520> luckily<00:05:43.909> on

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:44.509 
little wire it suffered but luckily on

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:47.409 
little wire it suffered but luckily on
top<00:05:44.930> of<00:05:45.169> the<00:05:45.650> logic<00:05:46.280> board<00:05:46.490> there<00:05:46.849> seems<00:05:47.120> to<00:05:47.210> be

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:47.419 
top of the logic board there seems to be

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:50.559 
top of the logic board there seems to be
a<00:05:47.449> socket<00:05:48.080> which<00:05:48.259> it<00:05:48.409> plugs<00:05:48.740> right<00:05:48.889> into<00:05:49.569> so

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:50.569 
a socket which it plugs right into so

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:53.230 
a socket which it plugs right into so
it's<00:05:50.689> not<00:05:50.840> really<00:05:50.900> of<00:05:51.849> severed<00:05:52.849> broken

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
it's not really of severed broken

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.790 
it's not really of severed broken
connection<00:05:53.629> it's<00:05:53.780> more<00:05:53.960> like<00:05:54.110> a<00:05:54.139> table<00:05:54.740> it

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
connection it's more like a table it

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.610 
connection it's more like a table it
just<00:05:54.949> popped<00:05:55.189> off<00:05:56.139> which<00:05:57.139> is<00:05:57.259> good<00:05:57.409> news<00:05:57.439> for

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 
just popped off which is good news for

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:08.269 
just popped off which is good news for
me<00:05:59.439> so

00:06:08.269 --> 00:06:08.279 

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:10.920 

I'm<00:06:09.279> still<00:06:09.639> kind<00:06:10.090> of<00:06:10.120> paranoid<00:06:10.509> I<00:06:10.689> want<00:06:10.870> to

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:10.930 
I'm still kind of paranoid I want to

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.839 
I'm still kind of paranoid I want to
verify<00:06:11.139> that<00:06:11.620> it<00:06:11.830> is<00:06:11.860> indeed<00:06:12.310> something<00:06:12.580> that

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:12.849 
verify that it is indeed something that

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:16.379 
verify that it is indeed something that
popped<00:06:13.090> off<00:06:13.300> not<00:06:13.599> something<00:06:13.990> that<00:06:14.110> broke<00:06:15.389> yeah

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:16.389 
popped off not something that broke yeah

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:17.550
