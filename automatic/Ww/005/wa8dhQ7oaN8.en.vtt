00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:07.750
 It is a little bit today It was a little bit talked about 

00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:09.070
 I would like to talk about chrome books, I think some people are a little concerned 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:14.230
 Ne Chrome Book 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:18.430
 It's been done last year from November 11, 2014. 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:20.060
 When it comes out, it sells from here Acer Ath Sus from here 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.900
 In a nutshell this chrome 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:27.439
 It says a book is a browser Tteyuu chrome that google is making 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:31.039
 I have it, but that chrome os is loaded 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:33.079
 It is compared with windows 8 Mac etc. that everyone is worried about becoming a computer 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:37.489
 What kind of merit there is 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:40.050
 Disadvantages that I would like to go to the place of the merit a little 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:46.079
 I will say a little, always os is the latest 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:51.899
 There is no need for anti-virus protection, and the battery can be as fast as 10 seconds. 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:53.160
 Most of the time you have to work with a web browser for multi-device information 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.370
 Share is likely to 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:02.079
 So if you can launch the web browser, it 's a computer spa 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:06.729
 I don't need checking, I just need something very good with the specs 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:11.020
 Local After you that it does not in the position pickles that the low-price range of the personal computer 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:13.430
 It is data It is not format to record data in hard disk or flash memory 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.690
 Because even if stolen 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.590
 The data is in the cloud, so it gets a password or something like that. 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.570
 Unless there is 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:29.270
 Disadvantages in the opposite at will into a form that prevent the because Nakano ne information outflow 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:33.450
 It is really the opposite of merit, but we manage everything on the web, so it is online 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:38.789
 It 's just a box that is totally useless unless it's connected to 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:42.810
 If the data transfer rate is capped to keep the web queen and data normally continuous 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.649
 Extreme performance telephones and possible uselessness and later chrome 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.939
 web store 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:51.090
 Here's how to download the app from here, but for the android app 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.440
 It says very application is small compared to the market 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.820
 I hope this can be improved later 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.810
 I wonder if the windows store is so subtle I would like to say 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.980
 I think you see that 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:07.030
 Peripheral devices that can not be used without installing drivers etc. on a PC 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:09.530
 There are scanners and such, but such things can not be used basically 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:13.940
 Please return the wireless router or something 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:18.850
 I think I can do such work such as printing with wi-fi 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:22.030
 After it does not correspond to the representative district office of this important business software 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:27.270
 If there is a need to replace the google document because 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:31.830
 However, Microsoft also offers a cloud-type office for this. 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:37.560
 I think I would worry if you worry so much , but when you come with such a PC , everyone 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:41.220
 I think there was a personal computer called netbook a few years ago 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:47.290
 You can buy for 100 yen if you sign up with a mobile router 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:51.250
 So it was sold so explosively once but now it is completely gone from the store 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:55.959
 It's difficult to use because of its ability is too low 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:03:00.969
 So it disappeared and the people who bought it are not usable because it is inconvenient 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:04.900
 Utsu-san also has one sound at home but I have a past that I have not used it at all 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:07.280
 This time it is I made where I mean to spread doing chrome book or this is also cheap 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:11.600
 This clone is reflected by how to use 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.740
 I said at the merit that I think it's very good, say low-end PC 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.480
 Because it will be 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:21.740
 It will be very easy to introduce as a pc for use in an online environment 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.400
 I think I'm looking at the video, I guess those rolling children like games and such 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.030
 Because I think 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.270
 It faces that say can only browser game I think it would be a little I hate 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:32.910
 With various sound companies 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:35.940
 You should buy a pc at low cost and use google sound service mainly 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:40.740
 It is very beneficial if it is used 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:42.800
 I think it's a pc, so if you're a little concerned, take a look at your business work 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:47.690
 It can be used as a hobby 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:51.200
 In think in another video that it is chrome book highly recommend it I thought a big one 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:56.390
 Buying and selling Somehow is also in google's to say 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:04:00.460
 Because it is os that google has to offer made is that there is always need on-line environment 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.460
 It is probably not bad though
