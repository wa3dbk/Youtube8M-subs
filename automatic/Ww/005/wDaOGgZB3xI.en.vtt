these<00:00:17.850> two<00:00:18.119> are<00:00:18.270> small<00:00:18.539> machines<00:00:19.760> I'm<00:00:20.760> know

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
these two are small machines I'm know

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.710 
these two are small machines I'm know
about<00:00:22.020> small<00:00:22.289> machines<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:23.420> did<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.449> whole<00:00:24.630> we

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
about small machines I did a whole we
