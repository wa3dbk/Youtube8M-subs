gets this generation so let's get
started<00:00:13.570> so<00:00:13.750> first<00:00:14.740> off<00:00:15.040> hero<00:00:15.700> as<00:00:16.029> we<00:00:16.209> all<00:00:16.360> know

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
started so first off hero as we all know

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.240 
started so first off hero as we all know
is<00:00:16.869> a<00:00:16.930> normal<00:00:17.619> flying-type<00:00:17.950> pokémon

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:18.250 
is a normal flying-type pokémon

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.120 
is a normal flying-type pokémon
introduced<00:00:19.149> into<00:00:19.540> Gen<00:00:19.750> 1<00:00:19.930> that<00:00:20.529> we<00:00:20.739> all<00:00:20.890> know

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
introduced into Gen 1 that we all know

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.429 
introduced into Gen 1 that we all know
and<00:00:21.279> love<00:00:21.360> well<00:00:22.360> previously<00:00:22.689> and<00:00:23.110> only<00:00:23.290> had

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:23.439 
and love well previously and only had

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.010 
and love well previously and only had
the<00:00:23.560> ability<00:00:23.950> kenai<00:00:24.399> which<00:00:25.329> is<00:00:25.660> kind<00:00:25.930> of

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.020 
the ability kenai which is kind of

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.499 
the ability kenai which is kind of
useless<00:00:26.230> in<00:00:26.559> singles<00:00:27.009> kind<00:00:27.610> of<00:00:27.790> in<00:00:27.970> my<00:00:28.119> opinion

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:28.509 
useless in singles kind of in my opinion

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:29.670 
useless in singles kind of in my opinion
because<00:00:28.689> there<00:00:29.020> really<00:00:29.140> aren't<00:00:29.380> a<00:00:29.500> lot<00:00:29.619> of

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:29.680 
because there really aren't a lot of

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.910 
because there really aren't a lot of
Pokemon<00:00:30.189> that<00:00:30.340> abuse<00:00:31.380> accuracy<00:00:32.380> drops

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
Pokemon that abuse accuracy drops

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.100 
Pokemon that abuse accuracy drops
so<00:00:33.100> since<00:00:33.880> kenai<00:00:34.180> prevents<00:00:34.600> it<00:00:34.720> and<00:00:34.900> really

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
so since kenai prevents it and really

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.860 
so since kenai prevents it and really
didn't<00:00:35.380> have<00:00:35.830> that<00:00:35.860> great<00:00:36.430> of<00:00:36.640> a<00:00:36.730> use<00:00:36.910> but<00:00:37.750> in

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
didn't have that great of a use but in

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.120 
didn't have that great of a use but in
the<00:00:37.930> dreamworld<00:00:38.230> it<00:00:38.470> does<00:00:38.620> have<00:00:38.800> the<00:00:38.920> sniper

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.130 
the dreamworld it does have the sniper

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.860 
the dreamworld it does have the sniper
ability<00:00:39.730> which<00:00:39.940> is<00:00:40.120> a<00:00:40.150> really<00:00:40.390> cool<00:00:40.480> ability

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
ability which is a really cool ability

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.200 
ability which is a really cool ability
that<00:00:41.590> increases<00:00:42.310> the<00:00:42.460> amount<00:00:42.670> of<00:00:42.790> damage<00:00:43.180> you

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
that increases the amount of damage you

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.140 
that increases the amount of damage you
get<00:00:43.510> from<00:00:43.720> a<00:00:43.840> critical<00:00:44.050> hit<00:00:44.500> so<00:00:45.370> this

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.150 
get from a critical hit so this

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.150 
get from a critical hit so this
basically<00:00:46.660> allows<00:00:46.780> fearow<00:00:47.350> to<00:00:47.470> do<00:00:47.710> a<00:00:47.740> lot<00:00:48.130> of

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
basically allows fearow to do a lot of

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.130 
basically allows fearow to do a lot of
damage<00:00:48.520> if<00:00:48.880> you<00:00:49.030> ever<00:00:49.210> land<00:00:49.480> a<00:00:49.600> critical<00:00:49.720> hit

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
damage if you ever land a critical hit

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.170 
damage if you ever land a critical hit
with<00:00:50.320> it<00:00:50.470> and<00:00:50.650> it<00:00:51.040> also<00:00:51.190> gets<00:00:51.520> a<00:00:51.700> nice<00:00:51.880> move

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
with it and it also gets a nice move

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.060 
with it and it also gets a nice move
this<00:00:52.390> generation<00:00:52.989> to<00:00:53.230> work<00:00:53.470> in<00:00:53.770> combination

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
this generation to work in combination

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.030 
this generation to work in combination
with<00:00:54.730> the<00:00:54.880> sniper<00:00:55.210> ability<00:00:55.810> because<00:00:56.770> the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
with the sniper ability because the

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.800 
with the sniper ability because the
movie<00:00:57.280> gets<00:00:57.520> has<00:00:57.790> an<00:00:58.030> increased<00:00:58.360> chance<00:00:58.450> of

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:58.810 
movie gets has an increased chance of

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.990 
movie gets has an increased chance of
critical<00:00:59.170> hit<00:00:59.350> so<00:00:59.680> when<00:01:00.040> you<00:01:00.130> do<00:01:00.550> land<00:01:00.820> that

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
critical hit so when you do land that

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.670 
critical hit so when you do land that
critical<00:01:01.390> hit<00:01:01.540> it'll<00:01:01.840> do<00:01:01.989> a<00:01:02.020> ridiculous

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
critical hit it'll do a ridiculous

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.740 
critical hit it'll do a ridiculous
amount<00:01:02.829> of<00:01:03.010> damage<00:01:03.340> now<00:01:04.210> looking<00:01:04.479> at<00:01:04.600> its

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
amount of damage now looking at its

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.690 
amount of damage now looking at its
stats<00:01:04.899> though<00:01:05.229> it<00:01:05.409> has<00:01:05.590> 90<00:01:06.010> physical<00:01:06.400> attack

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
stats though it has 90 physical attack

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.360 
stats though it has 90 physical attack
and<00:01:06.970> 100<00:01:07.420> and<00:01:07.540> speed<00:01:07.750> or<00:01:07.930> 100<00:01:08.320> speed<00:01:08.560> to<00:01:09.159> use

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 
and 100 and speed or 100 speed to use

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.590 
and 100 and speed or 100 speed to use
with<00:01:09.729> its<00:01:10.170> new<00:01:11.170> ability<00:01:11.590> but<00:01:12.310> basically<00:01:13.240> it

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
with its new ability but basically it

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.630 
with its new ability but basically it
was<00:01:13.960> never<00:01:14.260> really<00:01:14.500> that<00:01:14.650> powerful<00:01:15.190> of<00:01:15.550> a

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
was never really that powerful of a

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.580 
was never really that powerful of a
Pokemon<00:01:16.090> because<00:01:16.300> 90<00:01:16.900> isn't<00:01:17.260> the<00:01:17.380> most

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
Pokemon because 90 isn't the most

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.860 
Pokemon because 90 isn't the most
amazing<00:01:18.340> attacks<00:01:18.700> that<00:01:18.940> and<00:01:19.150> 100<00:01:19.540> isn't<00:01:19.780> the

most<00:01:20.020> amazing<00:01:20.590> speed<00:01:20.830> stat<00:01:21.100> but<00:01:21.970> this

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
most amazing speed stat but this

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.330 
most amazing speed stat but this
generation<00:01:22.570> it<00:01:22.960> gets<00:01:23.200> a<00:01:23.470> lot<00:01:23.680> of<00:01:23.710> good<00:01:24.070> moves

this video so first off we're gonna be

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.570 
this video so first off we're gonna be
giving<00:01:49.930> fearow<00:01:50.200> a<00:01:50.320> jolly<00:01:50.680> nature<00:01:50.890> to<00:01:51.280> increase

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
giving fearow a jolly nature to increase

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.250 
giving fearow a jolly nature to increase
its<00:01:51.790> speed<00:01:51.909> and<00:01:52.299> lower<00:01:52.420> its<00:01:52.630> physical<00:01:53.020> attack

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
its speed and lower its physical attack

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.600 
its speed and lower its physical attack
and<00:01:53.860> then<00:01:53.979> we're<00:01:54.070> gonna<00:01:54.189> be<00:01:54.340> using<00:01:54.549> the

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
and then we're gonna be using the

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.160 
and then we're gonna be using the
ability<00:01:54.880> sniper<00:01:55.180> since<00:01:55.630> that<00:01:55.810> is<00:01:55.930> a<00:01:55.960> new

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
ability gets in the Dru mold that can

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.690 
ability gets in the Dru mold that can
definitely<00:01:58.299> allow<00:01:59.130> furo<00:02:00.130> to<00:02:00.340> do<00:02:00.430> a<00:02:00.460> lot<00:02:00.670> of

your critical hit ratio thus allowing

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.250 
your critical hit ratio thus allowing

their critical hits because of the

their critical hits because of the
ability<00:02:36.330> after<00:02:37.330> the<00:02:37.420> move<00:02:37.569> set<00:02:37.810> though<00:02:37.989> the

first<00:02:39.100> one<00:02:39.280> we're<00:02:39.550> going<00:02:39.640> to<00:02:39.700> be<00:02:39.819> using<00:02:40.030> is<00:02:40.330> a

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
first one we're going to be using is a

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.020 
first one we're going to be using is a
nice<00:02:40.750> boost<00:02:41.110> that<00:02:41.350> furo<00:02:41.769> gets<00:02:42.069> which<00:02:42.550> is<00:02:42.580> in

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
nice boost that furo gets which is in

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.479 
nice boost that furo gets which is in
tier<00:02:43.390> up<00:02:43.510> which<00:02:44.230> is<00:02:44.410> a<00:02:44.440> move<00:02:44.709> that<00:02:44.739> increases

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
tier up which is a move that increases

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.190 
tier up which is a move that increases
your<00:02:45.519> physical<00:02:46.000> attack<00:02:46.269> and<00:02:46.540> special<00:02:46.930> attack

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
your physical attack and special attack

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.860 
your physical attack and special attack
by<00:02:47.440> one<00:02:47.620> stage<00:02:47.890> now<00:02:48.700> previously<00:02:49.060> fearow<00:02:49.600> had

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
by one stage now previously fearow had

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.990 
by one stage now previously fearow had
no<00:02:50.230> way<00:02:50.440> of<00:02:50.470> increasing<00:02:50.980> its<00:02:51.400> ninety<00:02:51.819> base

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
no way of increasing its ninety base

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.630 
no way of increasing its ninety base
physical<00:02:52.750> attack<00:02:53.019> so<00:02:53.680> cheer<00:02:53.980> up<00:02:54.010> is<00:02:54.250> a<00:02:54.280> great

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
physical attack so cheer up is a great

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.940 
physical attack so cheer up is a great
addition<00:02:54.970> to<00:02:55.390> its<00:02:55.690> move<00:02:55.959> pool<00:02:56.200> allowing<00:02:56.799> it<00:02:56.920> to

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
addition to its move pool allowing it to

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.070 
addition to its move pool allowing it to
increase<00:02:57.730> its<00:02:57.850> physical<00:02:58.330> attack<00:02:58.630> and<00:02:58.870> thus

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
increase its physical attack and thus

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.020 
increase its physical attack and thus
allow<00:02:59.380> it<00:02:59.560> to<00:02:59.680> do<00:02:59.860> more<00:03:00.130> damage<00:03:00.370> than<00:03:00.790> it<00:03:00.910> was

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
allow it to do more damage than it was

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.420 
allow it to do more damage than it was
previously<00:03:01.209> able<00:03:01.810> to<00:03:01.930> do<00:03:02.080> now<00:03:03.040> with<00:03:03.250> that

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
previously able to do now with that

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.979 
previously able to do now with that
we're<00:03:03.640> gonna<00:03:03.700> give<00:03:04.000> a<00:03:04.030> drill<00:03:04.330> peck<00:03:04.510> which<00:03:04.810> is

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
we're gonna give a drill peck which is

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.900 
we're gonna give a drill peck which is
pretty<00:03:05.260> much<00:03:05.470> what<00:03:05.739> I<00:03:05.769> considered<00:03:06.430> fearo's

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
pretty much what I considered fearo's

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.910 
pretty much what I considered fearo's
signature<00:03:07.510> move<00:03:07.720> because<00:03:08.170> that<00:03:08.440> was<00:03:08.590> pretty

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
signature move because that was pretty

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.949 
signature move because that was pretty
much<00:03:09.069> why<00:03:09.310> I<00:03:09.340> would<00:03:09.640> always<00:03:09.819> pick<00:03:10.299> it<00:03:10.510> as<00:03:10.660> one

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
much why I would always pick it as one

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.210 
much why I would always pick it as one
of<00:03:10.989> the<00:03:11.140> pokemon<00:03:11.530> in<00:03:11.560> my<00:03:11.739> party<00:03:12.040> because<00:03:12.190> I

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
of the pokemon in my party because I

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.559 
of the pokemon in my party because I
learned<00:03:12.430> drill<00:03:12.700> peck<00:03:12.850> and<00:03:13.090> I<00:03:13.150> didn't<00:03:13.330> want<00:03:13.480> to

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
learned drill peck and I didn't want to

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.000 
learned drill peck and I didn't want to
use<00:03:13.660> fly<00:03:13.959> but<00:03:14.950> that's<00:03:15.160> a<00:03:15.280> great<00:03:15.489> stab

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
use fly but that's a great stab

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.319 
use fly but that's a great stab
flying-type<00:03:18.010> move<00:03:18.340> that<00:03:18.519> I<00:03:18.549> can<00:03:18.760> make<00:03:18.910> use<00:03:19.090> of

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
flying-type move that I can make use of

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.509 
flying-type move that I can make use of
but<00:03:20.109> with<00:03:20.260> that<00:03:20.440> we're<00:03:20.650> also<00:03:20.799> gonna<00:03:21.040> be<00:03:21.220> making

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
but with that we're also gonna be making

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.759 
but with that we're also gonna be making
use<00:03:21.670> of<00:03:21.700> a<00:03:22.030> new<00:03:22.239> move<00:03:22.480> known<00:03:22.840> as<00:03:22.870> drill<00:03:23.500> liner

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
use of a new move known as drill liner

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.250 
use of a new move known as drill liner
which<00:03:24.160> is<00:03:24.190> a<00:03:24.459> ground<00:03:25.000> type<00:03:25.299> move<00:03:25.570> that<00:03:25.930> has<00:03:26.079> an

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
which is a ground type move that has an

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.140 
which is a ground type move that has an
increased<00:03:26.650> chance<00:03:26.739> of<00:03:27.130> critical<00:03:27.670> hit<00:03:27.850> and

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
increased chance of critical hit and

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.170 
increased chance of critical hit and
that<00:03:28.959> is<00:03:29.170> why<00:03:29.350> I<00:03:29.380> think<00:03:29.680> that<00:03:30.010> it<00:03:30.549> is<00:03:30.790> a<00:03:30.820> great

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
that is why I think that it is a great

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.210 
that is why I think that it is a great
move<00:03:31.390> to<00:03:31.600> use<00:03:31.840> with<00:03:32.140> fearow<00:03:32.560> because<00:03:33.010> of<00:03:33.130> the

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
move to use with fearow because of the

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.729 
move to use with fearow because of the
fact<00:03:33.459> that<00:03:33.609> increased<00:03:34.390> critical<00:03:35.079> hit<00:03:35.260> chances

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
fact that increased critical hit chances

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.250 
fact that increased critical hit chances
means<00:03:36.310> that<00:03:36.609> sniper<00:03:37.030> can<00:03:37.359> activate<00:03:37.840> and<00:03:38.079> thus

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
means that sniper can activate and thus

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.870 
means that sniper can activate and thus
allow<00:03:38.500> you<00:03:38.560> to<00:03:38.829> do<00:03:38.980> more<00:03:39.190> damage<00:03:39.430> with<00:03:39.760> their

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
allow you to do more damage with their

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.569 
allow you to do more damage with their
physical<00:03:40.060> boobs<00:03:40.680> but<00:03:41.680> it's<00:03:42.010> really<00:03:42.250> weird

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
physical boobs but it's really weird

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:43.979 
physical boobs but it's really weird
that<00:03:42.910> you<00:03:43.090> know<00:03:43.209> a<00:03:43.239> flying-type<00:03:43.660> pokémon

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
that you know a flying-type pokémon

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.229 
that you know a flying-type pokémon
normal<00:03:44.739> flying-type<00:03:45.040> pokémon<00:03:45.340> can<00:03:45.850> learn<00:03:46.030> a

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
normal flying-type pokémon can learn a

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.289 
normal flying-type pokémon can learn a
powerful<00:03:47.049> ground<00:03:47.350> type<00:03:47.650> move<00:03:47.890> that<00:03:48.700> is<00:03:49.030> pretty

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
powerful ground type move that is pretty

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.599 
powerful ground type move that is pretty
much<00:03:49.480> Dori<00:03:49.840> uses<00:03:50.290> signature<00:03:50.799> in<00:03:51.040> my<00:03:51.070> opinion

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
much Dori uses signature in my opinion

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:55.250 
much Dori uses signature in my opinion
but<00:03:52.450> basically<00:03:53.200> it's<00:03:53.500> a<00:03:53.650> great<00:03:53.890> addition<00:03:54.400> to

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
but basically it's a great addition to

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.720 
but basically it's a great addition to
Bureau's<00:03:56.260> type<00:03:56.560> coverage<00:03:57.010> because<00:03:57.519> of<00:03:57.549> the

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
Bureau's type coverage because of the

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.789 
Bureau's type coverage because of the
fact<00:03:58.030> that<00:03:58.150> you<00:03:58.420> know<00:03:58.569> flying-type<00:03:59.380> moves

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
fact that you know flying-type moves

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:03.300 
fact that you know flying-type moves
can't<00:04:00.160> hit<00:04:00.430> or<00:04:00.790> hurt<00:04:01.230> electric<00:04:02.230> steel<00:04:02.950> and

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
can't hit or hurt electric steel and

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.640 
can't hit or hurt electric steel and
rock<00:04:03.489> type<00:04:03.730> moves<00:04:03.970> or<00:04:04.569> as<00:04:04.780> drill<00:04:05.140> liner<00:04:05.350> is

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
rock type moves or as drill liner is

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.710 
rock type moves or as drill liner is
super<00:04:06.010> effective<00:04:06.459> against<00:04:07.030> all<00:04:07.209> those<00:04:07.420> kinds

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
super effective against all those kinds

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.180 
super effective against all those kinds
of<00:04:07.780> Pokemon<00:04:08.170> and<00:04:08.319> I<00:04:08.350> know<00:04:08.410> I<00:04:08.500> just<00:04:08.590> said<00:04:08.890> moves

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
of Pokemon and I know I just said moves

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.789 
of Pokemon and I know I just said moves
and<00:04:09.489> I<00:04:09.549> met<00:04:09.700> Pokemon<00:04:10.150> but<00:04:10.870> drill<00:04:11.500> liner<00:04:11.620> is

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
and I met Pokemon but drill liner is

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:13.319 
and I met Pokemon but drill liner is
super<00:04:12.040> effective<00:04:12.459> against<00:04:12.760> all<00:04:12.850> those<00:04:13.030> types

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.329 
super effective against all those types

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:15.720 
super effective against all those types
that<00:04:13.720> drill<00:04:14.109> peck<00:04:14.290> is<00:04:14.560> not<00:04:15.010> very<00:04:15.280> effective

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
that drill peck is not very effective

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.789 
that drill peck is not very effective
against<00:04:16.150> so<00:04:16.660> it<00:04:16.840> allows<00:04:17.079> you<00:04:17.289> to<00:04:17.320> have<00:04:17.530> some

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
against so it allows you to have some

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.500

really<00:04:18.130> great<00:04:18.370> type<00:04:18.729> coverage<00:04:19.150> with<00:04:19.359> this

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
really great type coverage with this

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.930 
really great type coverage with this
move<00:04:19.859> also<00:04:20.859> though<00:04:21.039> we<00:04:21.280> could<00:04:21.519> make<00:04:21.700> use<00:04:21.910> of

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
move also though we could make use of

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.969 
move also though we could make use of
sky<00:04:22.450> attack<00:04:22.780> as<00:04:23.080> a<00:04:23.110> way<00:04:23.349> to<00:04:23.409> use<00:04:23.740> in

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
sky attack as a way to use in

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:25.800 
sky attack as a way to use in
combination<00:04:24.640> with<00:04:24.789> power<00:04:24.970> herb<00:04:25.270> as<00:04:25.510> like<00:04:25.780> a

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
combination with power herb as like a

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.260 
combination with power herb as like a
one-shot<00:04:26.470> deal<00:04:26.500> to<00:04:27.039> do<00:04:27.159> a<00:04:27.190> lot<00:04:27.580> of<00:04:27.729> damage<00:04:28.120> and

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
one-shot deal to do a lot of damage and

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.100 
one-shot deal to do a lot of damage and
also<00:04:28.630> a

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
also a

also a

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
30% chance to flinch so that's great on

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.930 
30% chance to flinch so that's great on
fear<00:04:31.840> Oh<00:04:31.870> as<00:04:32.080> well<00:04:32.290> but<00:04:33.040> you<00:04:33.190> could<00:04:33.340> also<00:04:33.490> use

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
fear Oh as well but you could also use

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.570 
fear Oh as well but you could also use
u-turn<00:04:34.600> as<00:04:34.960> your<00:04:35.320> other<00:04:35.440> move<00:04:35.800> to<00:04:36.190> you<00:04:36.490> know

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
u-turn as your other move to you know

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.520 
u-turn as your other move to you know
switch<00:04:36.910> out<00:04:37.120> a<00:04:37.150> battle<00:04:37.630> if<00:04:37.810> you<00:04:37.840> don't<00:04:38.260> like

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
switch out a battle if you don't like

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.130 
switch out a battle if you don't like
the<00:04:38.770> Pokemon<00:04:39.280> you're<00:04:39.400> up<00:04:39.520> against<00:04:39.940> or<00:04:40.140> Scout

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
the Pokemon you're up against or Scout

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.810 
the Pokemon you're up against or Scout
for<00:04:41.530> your<00:04:41.680> opponent's<00:04:42.160> team<00:04:42.370> if<00:04:42.610> they're

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
for your opponent's team if they're

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.520 
for your opponent's team if they're
trying<00:04:43.270> to<00:04:43.420> switch<00:04:43.690> or<00:04:43.870> something<00:04:44.200> like<00:04:44.290> that

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
trying to switch or something like that

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.710 
trying to switch or something like that
though<00:04:45.430> you<00:04:45.490> do<00:04:45.910> have<00:04:45.940> to<00:04:46.150> worry<00:04:46.360> if<00:04:46.570> you're

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
though you do have to worry if you're

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.270 
though you do have to worry if you're
using<00:04:46.870> u-turn<00:04:47.320> because<00:04:47.740> of<00:04:47.860> the<00:04:47.920> fact<00:04:48.160> that

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
using u-turn because of the fact that

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.890 
using u-turn because of the fact that
you<00:04:48.460> do<00:04:48.610> take<00:04:48.820> increased<00:04:49.330> damage<00:04:49.750> from

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
you do take increased damage from

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.240 
you do take increased damage from
Stealth<00:04:50.140> rocks<00:04:50.500> being<00:04:50.770> a<00:04:50.920> flying-type

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
Stealth rocks being a flying-type

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.160 
Stealth rocks being a flying-type
pokémon<00:04:51.580> so<00:04:52.150> that<00:04:52.300> is<00:04:52.450> something<00:04:52.660> to<00:04:52.870> look<00:04:52.990> out

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.170 
pokémon so that is something to look out

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.620 
pokémon so that is something to look out
for<00:04:53.410> but<00:04:54.160> other<00:04:54.460> than<00:04:54.670> that<00:04:54.850> this<00:04:55.090> is<00:04:55.150> actually

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
for but other than that this is actually

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.840 
for but other than that this is actually
a<00:04:55.690> pretty<00:04:56.080> great<00:04:56.440> move<00:04:56.740> set<00:04:57.040> to<00:04:57.280> use<00:04:57.520> on<00:04:57.820> a

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
a pretty great move set to use on a

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.880 
a pretty great move set to use on a
fearow<00:04:58.180> in<00:04:58.390> my<00:04:58.510> opinion<00:04:58.930> because<00:04:59.500> you<00:04:59.740> can

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
fearow in my opinion because you can

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.590 
fearow in my opinion because you can
boost<00:05:00.100> your<00:05:00.250> attack<00:05:00.610> and<00:05:00.910> also<00:05:01.180> do<00:05:01.330> a<00:05:01.360> lot<00:05:01.570> of

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
boost your attack and also do a lot of

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.870 
boost your attack and also do a lot of
damage<00:05:01.870> while<00:05:02.590> also<00:05:03.070> having<00:05:03.400> a<00:05:03.460> chance<00:05:03.730> to

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
damage while also having a chance to
