00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
little jungle flasher now you should

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.660 
little jungle flasher now you should
have<00:00:15.780> already<00:00:15.929> install<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.680> USB<00:00:16.710> drivers<00:00:17.640> and

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
have already install the USB drivers and

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.779 
have already install the USB drivers and
once<00:00:18.240> you<00:00:18.480> install<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.380> USB<00:00:19.410> drivers<00:00:20.189> you

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
once you install the USB drivers you

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.370 
once you install the USB drivers you
should<00:00:21.090> notice<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:24.439> device<00:00:25.439> showing<00:00:26.250> in<00:00:26.490> your

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
should notice the device showing in your

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.540 
should notice the device showing in your
device<00:00:28.380> manager<00:00:28.830> so<00:00:28.949> let's<00:00:29.070> go<00:00:29.220> look<00:00:29.369> at<00:00:29.519> that

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
device manager so let's go look at that

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.060 
device manager so let's go look at that
real<00:00:29.849> quick<00:00:30.090> just<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.510> show<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.920> let's<00:00:31.920> do

USB<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:47.129> means<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.460> install<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.879> drivers

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
USB that means you install the drivers

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.779 
USB that means you install the drivers
correctly<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.590> reboot<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.100> machine<00:00:50.489> and

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
correctly you reboot of the machine and

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.920 
correctly you reboot of the machine and
you<00:00:51.690> had<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:52.020> plugged<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.010> USB<00:00:53.250> is

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
you had it plugged in and the USB is

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.270 
you had it plugged in and the USB is
computers<00:00:54.930> be<00:00:55.050> cables<00:00:55.379> connected<00:00:55.739> unless<00:00:56.070> you

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
computers be cables connected unless you

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.330 
computers be cables connected unless you
get<00:00:56.370> your<00:00:56.550> pros<00:00:56.760> on<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.329> there<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:57.930> go<00:00:58.340> it's

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
get your pros on and there you go it's

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.869 
get your pros on and there you go it's
there<00:00:59.640> so<00:01:00.270> USB<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.719> good<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.260> means<00:01:01.440> our<00:01:01.879> data

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
there so USB is good that means our data

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.880 
there so USB is good that means our data
communication<00:01:03.539> between<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.409> probe<00:01:04.680> the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
communication between the probe the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.390 
communication between the probe the
device<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.430> our<00:01:05.610> computer<00:01:05.790> will<00:01:06.090> work<00:01:07.400> next

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
device and our computer will work next

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.039 
device and our computer will work next
we<00:01:08.520> just<00:01:08.640> going<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.820> make<00:01:08.909> sure<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.390> the

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
we just going to make sure that the

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.100 
we just going to make sure that the
onboard<00:01:10.920> serial<00:01:11.880> ata<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.210> lot<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.600> other<00:01:12.869> guides

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
onboard serial ata a lot of other guides

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.630 
onboard serial ata a lot of other guides
will<00:01:13.320> also<00:01:13.650> tell<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.310> need<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.490> buy

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
will also tell you that you need to buy

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.700 
will also tell you that you need to buy
this<00:01:14.700> stupid<00:01:15.180> be<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:16.820> pci<00:01:17.820> card<00:01:18.270> which<00:01:18.710> unless

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
this stupid be a pci card which unless

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.289 
this stupid be a pci card which unless
you<00:01:19.920> have<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.070> computer<00:01:20.400> older<00:01:20.759> than<00:01:20.909> 10<00:01:21.270> years

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
you have a computer older than 10 years

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.780 
you have a computer older than 10 years
old<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.900> wouldn't<00:01:22.259> need<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.500> because<00:01:23.430> most

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
old you wouldn't need it because most

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.340 
old you wouldn't need it because most
computers<00:01:24.150> will<00:01:24.240> have<00:01:24.330> an<00:01:24.450> on-board<00:01:24.840> SATA

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
computers will have an on-board SATA

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.609 
computers will have an on-board SATA
port<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:27.240> just<00:01:27.479> kind<00:01:27.659> of<00:01:27.750> directly<00:01:28.140> in<00:01:28.350> to

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
port so I just kind of directly in to

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.210 
port so I just kind of directly in to
the<00:01:29.549> onboard<00:01:29.970> port<00:01:30.270> which<00:01:30.509> didn't<00:01:30.810> show<00:01:31.020> you

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
the onboard port which didn't show you

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.530 
the onboard port which didn't show you
so<00:01:32.220> let's<00:01:32.250> look<00:01:32.549> at<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.150> video<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.420> took

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
so let's look at that the video I took

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.480 
so let's look at that the video I took
it<00:01:33.750> off<00:01:33.869> actually<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.530> forgot<00:01:34.979> about<00:01:35.159> that<00:01:36.200> so

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
it off actually I forgot about that so

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.600 
it off actually I forgot about that so
here's<00:01:38.490> my<00:01:39.500> SATA<00:01:40.500> cable<00:01:40.890> coming<00:01:41.100> out<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.340> the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
here's my SATA cable coming out of the

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.210 
here's my SATA cable coming out of the
computer<00:01:42.229> we'll<00:01:43.229> go<00:01:43.380> ahead<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.619> just<00:01:43.829> plug

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
computer we'll go ahead and just plug

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.690 
computer we'll go ahead and just plug
that<00:01:44.250> in

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.990 

okay<00:01:51.570> there<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.110> plugged<00:01:52.469> in<00:01:52.880> going<00:01:53.880> into

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
okay there it is plugged in going into

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.990 
okay there it is plugged in going into
the<00:01:54.240> computer<00:01:54.810> there<00:01:55.049> all<00:01:55.829> right<00:01:56.039> good<00:01:56.610> that's

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
the computer there all right good that's

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:09.020 
the computer there all right good that's
it<00:02:00.979> all<00:02:01.979> right<00:02:02.450> so<00:02:06.710> yeah<00:02:07.710> so<00:02:08.069> that's<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.550> okay

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
it all right so yeah so that's that okay

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.390 
it all right so yeah so that's that okay
so<00:02:09.090> now<00:02:09.479> we<00:02:10.319> got<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.769> so<00:02:10.950> let's<00:02:11.069> just<00:02:11.250> make

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
so now we got that so let's just make

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.729 
so now we got that so let's just make
sure<00:02:11.670> it's<00:02:11.880> working<00:02:11.940> so<00:02:12.599> we'll<00:02:13.260> go<00:02:13.470> into<00:02:13.650> the

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
sure it's working so we'll go into the

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.030 
sure it's working so we'll go into the
jungle<00:02:13.830> flasher<00:02:14.280> go<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.700> DVD<00:02:15.090> key<00:02:15.300> 32<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:16.050> here

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
jungle flasher go to DVD key 32 and here
