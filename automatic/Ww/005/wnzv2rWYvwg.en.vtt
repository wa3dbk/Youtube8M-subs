a little line 6 amp here and let me show

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.459 
a little line 6 amp here and let me show
you<00:00:38.910> what<00:00:39.030> my<00:00:39.149> my<00:00:39.600> signal<00:00:40.019> sounds<00:00:40.289> like

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
you what my my signal sounds like

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.529 
you what my my signal sounds like
without<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.159> compressor<00:00:41.699> and<00:00:41.850> maybe<00:00:42.359> you'll

00:00:42.529 --> 00:00:42.539 
without the compressor and maybe you'll

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:45.200 
without the compressor and maybe you'll
hear<00:00:42.659> some<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:42.929> these<00:00:43.339> volume<00:00:44.339> spikes<00:00:44.640> that

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
hear some of these volume spikes that

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:52.130 
hear some of these volume spikes that
this<00:00:45.480> will<00:00:45.659> help<00:00:45.809> even<00:00:46.440> out<00:00:46.559> check<00:00:46.859> it<00:00:46.890> out<00:00:47.069> so

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.290 

and<00:00:52.350> when<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.890> hit<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.130> really<00:00:53.430> hard<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.150> can

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
and when you hit it really hard it can

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.330 
and when you hit it really hard it can
be<00:00:54.480> kind<00:00:54.720> of<00:00:54.840> harsh<00:00:57.890> distorts<00:00:58.890> almost<00:00:59.250> a

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
be kind of harsh distorts almost a

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
be kind of harsh distorts almost a
little<00:00:59.520> bit<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.760> especially<00:01:00.150> if<00:01:00.240> you're

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
little bit and especially if you're

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.690 
little bit and especially if you're
doing<00:01:00.540> you<00:01:01.110> know<00:01:01.260> some<00:01:01.470> finger<00:01:02.130> picking<00:01:02.370> stuff

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
doing you know some finger picking stuff

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:11.350 
doing you know some finger picking stuff
like<00:01:07.340> but<00:01:08.340> turn<00:01:09.300> on<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.540> lemon<00:01:09.810> squeeze<00:01:09.960> and

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
like but turn on the lemon squeeze and

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.200 
like but turn on the lemon squeeze and
the<00:01:12.360> soft<00:01:12.660> sounds<00:01:13.200> are<00:01:13.650> louder<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:15.030> real

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
the soft sounds are louder and the real

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.890 
the soft sounds are louder and the real
spikey<00:01:15.810> loud<00:01:16.740> sounds<00:01:17.220> are<00:01:17.370> lower<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.540> evens

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
spikey loud sounds are lower so it evens

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.070 
spikey loud sounds are lower so it evens
everything<00:01:19.050> out<00:01:23.900> can<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:24.960> hear<00:01:25.050> that

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
everything out can you hear that

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:35.150 
everything out can you hear that
compressor<00:01:25.619> kicking<00:01:25.950> in<00:01:33.650> it's<00:01:34.650> good<00:01:34.860> for<00:01:35.070> that

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
compressor kicking in it's good for that

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:43.620 
compressor kicking in it's good for that
kind<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.490> stuff<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:35.850> again<00:01:35.970> on<00:01:36.330> a<00:01:36.390> rhythm<00:01:36.869> tone

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.359 

it<00:01:44.630> just<00:01:44.840> kick<00:01:45.619> it<00:01:45.710> on<00:01:45.770> it<00:01:45.920> smooths<00:01:46.219> everything

and you can set it for anywhere from

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.060 
and you can set it for anywhere from
extreme<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:57.030> just<00:01:57.270> just<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.140> touch<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.620> again

it's a simple three knob configuration

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.090 
it's a simple three knob configuration
you<00:02:02.100> got<00:02:02.280> level<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:03.360> got<00:02:03.570> sustain<00:02:04.140> which<00:02:04.890> is

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
you got level you got sustain which is

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.950 
you got level you got sustain which is
how<00:02:05.250> long<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.880> want<00:02:06.120> that<00:02:06.360> compressor<00:02:06.810> to

how long you want that compressor to

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.740 
how long you want that compressor to

it the sustainer section of it it really

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.480 
it the sustainer section of it it really
does<00:02:24.660> it<00:02:24.900> will<00:02:25.050> help<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:25.530> hold<00:02:26.130> your<00:02:26.340> notes

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
out longer let me let me dial up a

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.920 
out longer let me let me dial up a
little<00:02:28.980> crunch<00:02:29.340> setting<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:32.030> okay<00:02:33.030> here's<00:02:33.840> a

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
little crunch setting and okay here's a

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.720 
little crunch setting and okay here's a
say<00:02:34.410> your<00:02:34.560> bending<00:02:34.830> a<00:02:34.920> note<00:02:35.100> and<00:02:35.340> we'll<00:02:35.550> see

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
say your bending a note and we'll see

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.730 
say your bending a note and we'll see
how<00:02:35.850> long<00:02:35.910> this<00:02:36.060> holds<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:36.990> then<00:02:37.410> we'll<00:02:37.560> turn

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
how long this holds and then we'll turn

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:38.990 
how long this holds and then we'll turn
the<00:02:37.950> LM<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.220> squeeze<00:02:38.490> on<00:02:38.640> check<00:02:38.820> it<00:02:38.910> out

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
the LM and squeeze on check it out

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.759
