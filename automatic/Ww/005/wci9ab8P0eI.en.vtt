called<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.390> man<00:00:54.600> cave<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.340> I<00:00:56.340> guess<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.789> could

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
called a man cave and I guess that could

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.540 
called a man cave and I guess that could
be<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.870> sounds<00:00:58.199> kind<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.559> um<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:59.070> think

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
be it sounds kind of um I think

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.979 
be it sounds kind of um I think
everybody<00:00:59.940> should<00:01:00.059> have<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.210> cave<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.570> think<00:01:00.750> a

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
everybody should have a cave I think a

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.469 
everybody should have a cave I think a
woman<00:01:01.320> cave<00:01:01.649> would<00:01:01.770> be<00:01:01.859> cool<00:01:02.039> too

as<00:01:32.369> you'd<00:01:32.549> think<00:01:32.640> for<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.970> guy<00:01:33.090> who<00:01:33.150> designs

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
as you'd think for a guy who designs

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
like a room so to do that I

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.550 
like a room so to do that I
made<00:02:12.849> this<00:02:12.969> really<00:02:13.239> teeny-tiny<00:02:13.689> door<00:02:14.230> here

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
made this really teeny-tiny door here

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.459 
made this really teeny-tiny door here
that's<00:02:14.680> only<00:02:14.859> 18<00:02:15.250> inches<00:02:15.280> wide<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:16.469> that

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:17.469 
that's only 18 inches wide and that

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:19.559 
that's only 18 inches wide and that
pinches<00:02:17.980> people<00:02:18.310> down<00:02:18.489> so<00:02:18.879> that<00:02:19.060> everything's

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
pinches people down so that everything's

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.360 
pinches people down so that everything's
relative<00:02:19.870> when<00:02:20.260> you<00:02:20.349> get<00:02:20.530> past<00:02:20.739> that<00:02:20.980> this

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
relative when you get past that this

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.149 
relative when you get past that this
seems<00:02:21.609> huge<00:02:22.000> and<00:02:22.329> it<00:02:22.780> seems<00:02:22.989> almost<00:02:23.170> well

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 
seems huge and it seems almost well

seems huge and it seems almost well
relatively<00:02:24.819> huge<00:02:25.060> anyway<00:02:25.390> I<00:02:28.859> could<00:02:29.859> slide<00:02:30.099> a

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
relatively huge anyway I could slide a

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.149 
relatively huge anyway I could slide a
huge<00:02:30.930> solid<00:02:31.930> mattress<00:02:32.290> up<00:02:32.439> there<00:02:32.590> like<00:02:32.829> a<00:02:32.859> firm

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:33.159 
huge solid mattress up there like a firm

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:35.190 
huge solid mattress up there like a firm
one<00:02:33.430> but<00:02:33.879> when<00:02:34.569> you<00:02:34.629> have<00:02:34.750> a<00:02:34.780> little<00:02:35.019> hole

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
one but when you have a little hole

one but when you have a little hole
going<00:02:35.469> up<00:02:35.590> to<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.769> loft<00:02:35.920> it's<00:02:36.400> best<00:02:36.579> to<00:02:36.639> get<00:02:36.790> a

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
going up to the loft it's best to get a

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.280 
going up to the loft it's best to get a
bed<00:02:37.060> like<00:02:37.299> when<00:02:37.540> I<00:02:37.569> have<00:02:37.750> up<00:02:37.870> there<00:02:37.900> which<00:02:38.170> is

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
bed like when I have up there which is

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.709

just<00:02:38.469> a<00:02:38.590> roll<00:02:38.799> put<00:02:39.340> it<00:02:39.430> up<00:02:39.549> through<00:02:39.790> or<00:02:40.180> just<00:02:40.569> a

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:40.719 
just a roll put it up through or just a

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
piece of foam another thing I've learned

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.920 
piece of foam another thing I've learned
since<00:02:42.549> last<00:02:42.790> time<00:02:43.000> it's<00:02:43.180> just<00:02:43.239> that<00:02:43.420> people

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
since last time it's just that people

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.289 
since last time it's just that people
have<00:02:44.170> such<00:02:44.409> varied<00:02:44.859> needs<00:02:45.099> it's<00:02:45.609> really<00:02:46.060> hard

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
have such varied needs it's really hard

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.119 
have such varied needs it's really hard
to<00:02:46.419> design<00:02:46.569> a<00:02:46.750> small<00:02:47.079> house<00:02:47.260> for<00:02:47.290> other<00:02:47.680> people

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129

to design a small house for other people
and<00:02:48.700> that's<00:02:49.090> why<00:02:49.359> I'm<00:02:49.480> making<00:02:49.599> this<00:02:50.189> this

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:51.189 
and that's why I'm making this this

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:54.720 
and that's why I'm making this this
series<00:02:51.609> of<00:02:51.879> houses<00:02:52.599> more<00:02:53.109> flexible<00:02:53.680> I<00:02:53.829> have

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
series of houses more flexible I have

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.099 
series of houses more flexible I have

the<00:03:44.530> other<00:03:44.680> houses<00:03:44.919> and<00:03:45.280> those<00:03:46.000> make<00:03:46.359> it<00:03:46.599> a

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
the other houses and those make it a

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.420 
the other houses and those make it a
little<00:03:46.989> bit<00:03:47.139> wider<00:03:47.379> than<00:03:47.530> the<00:03:47.709> other<00:03:47.919> houses<00:03:48.129> I

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
little bit wider than the other houses I

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.610 
little bit wider than the other houses I
wanted<00:03:49.030> to<00:03:49.090> get<00:03:49.209> it<00:03:49.299> off<00:03:49.419> the<00:03:49.599> trailer<00:03:49.930> so<00:03:50.470> now

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
wanted to get it off the trailer so now

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.869 
wanted to get it off the trailer so now
you<00:03:50.680> can<00:03:50.859> put<00:03:50.979> it<00:03:51.069> on<00:03:51.159> the<00:03:51.310> ground<00:03:51.549> and<00:03:51.790> not

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:51.879 
you can put it on the ground and not

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:53.219 
you can put it on the ground and not
spend<00:03:52.180> an<00:03:52.269> extra<00:03:52.449> three<00:03:52.720> thousand<00:03:53.079> dollars

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:53.229 
spend an extra three thousand dollars

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:54.899 
spend an extra three thousand dollars
from<00:03:53.319> that<00:03:53.439> trailer<00:03:53.739> and<00:03:54.009> then<00:03:54.519> if<00:03:54.609> you<00:03:54.699> want

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:54.909 
from that trailer and then if you want

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:56.759 
from that trailer and then if you want
the<00:03:55.000> trailer<00:03:55.239> it<00:03:55.479> still<00:03:55.810> fits<00:03:56.079> on<00:03:56.229> a<00:03:56.409> flatbed

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
the trailer it still fits on a flatbed

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.539 
the trailer it still fits on a flatbed
the<00:03:57.759> idea<00:03:58.090> is<00:03:58.209> that<00:03:58.449> it's<00:03:58.629> a<00:03:58.720> shell<00:03:59.319> so<00:03:59.919> when

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
the idea is that it's a shell so when

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.460 
the idea is that it's a shell so when
you<00:04:00.669> buy<00:04:00.849> it<00:04:00.909> you<00:04:01.239> just<00:04:01.419> buy<00:04:01.540> the<00:04:01.599> shell<00:04:01.989> but

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
you buy it you just buy the shell but

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.140 
you buy it you just buy the shell but
you<00:04:02.590> can<00:04:02.739> put<00:04:02.889> the<00:04:02.979> components<00:04:03.310> in<00:04:03.699> later<00:04:03.909> like

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
you can put the components in later like

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.729 
you can put the components in later like
if<00:04:04.269> you<00:04:04.389> want<00:04:04.569> the<00:04:04.659> bathroom<00:04:05.079> component<00:04:05.530> slice

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
if you want the bathroom component slice

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:07.679 
if you want the bathroom component slice
right<00:04:05.889> through<00:04:05.949> the<00:04:06.159> door<00:04:06.340> and<00:04:06.759> same<00:04:07.479> with<00:04:07.599> the

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:07.689 
right through the door and same with the

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:09.179 
right through the door and same with the
kitchen<00:04:07.989> component<00:04:08.409> those<00:04:08.530> can<00:04:08.680> be<00:04:08.769> arranged

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:09.189 
kitchen component those can be arranged

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:11.009 
kitchen component those can be arranged
wherever<00:04:09.489> you<00:04:09.669> want<00:04:09.849> them<00:04:10.090> I<00:04:10.269> think<00:04:10.750> this<00:04:10.870> is

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
wherever you want them I think this is

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:15.439 
wherever you want them I think this is
the<00:04:11.729> world's<00:04:12.729> smallest<00:04:12.989> bathtub<00:04:13.989> shower<00:04:14.709> sink

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:15.449 
the world's smallest bathtub shower sink

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:17.520 
the world's smallest bathtub shower sink
then<00:04:16.449> there's<00:04:16.599> a<00:04:16.690> toilet<00:04:17.019> in<00:04:17.109> there<00:04:17.289> and

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
then there's a toilet in there and

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.009 
then there's a toilet in there and
that's<00:04:17.680> about<00:04:17.799> all<00:04:17.919> I<00:04:18.099> need<00:04:18.690> that's

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
that's about all I need that's

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.080 
that's about all I need that's
I<00:04:20.079> mean<00:04:20.379> it<00:04:20.440> looks<00:04:20.560> like<00:04:20.620> a<00:04:20.829> pocket<00:04:21.310> it<00:04:21.489> is<00:04:21.669> it's

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
I mean it looks like a pocket it is it's

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.059 
I mean it looks like a pocket it is it's
japanese-style<00:04:22.990> like<00:04:23.169> a<00:04:23.199> no<00:04:23.349> furrow<00:04:23.590> so<00:04:23.919> it's

00:04:24.059 --> 00:04:24.069 
japanese-style like a no furrow so it's

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:25.740 
japanese-style like a no furrow so it's
very<00:04:24.280> deep<00:04:24.550> in<00:04:24.759> not<00:04:25.090> very<00:04:25.120> much<00:04:25.569> square

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
very deep in not very much square

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.570 
very deep in not very much square
footage<00:04:25.870> so<00:04:26.349> it<00:04:26.620> takes<00:04:26.949> advantage<00:04:27.400> of

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
footage so it takes advantage of

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.850 
footage so it takes advantage of
vertical<00:04:28.330> space<00:04:28.419> I<00:04:28.870> love<00:04:29.500> it

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
vertical space I love it

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.379 
vertical space I love it
it's<00:04:30.099> very<00:04:30.370> cozy<00:04:30.699> like<00:04:30.970> I<00:04:31.030> feel<00:04:31.210> really

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
it's very cozy like I feel really

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:32.610 
it's very cozy like I feel really
comfortable<00:04:31.629> which<00:04:32.110> is<00:04:32.229> how<00:04:32.349> you<00:04:32.409> want<00:04:32.590> to

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
read a book you could actually fill it

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.279 
read a book you could actually fill it

I've<00:04:43.030> ever<00:04:43.060> seen<00:04:43.509> I<00:04:43.750> designed<00:04:44.470> it<00:04:44.590> to<00:04:44.620> be<00:04:44.710> just

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
I've ever seen I designed it to be just

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:47.999 
I've ever seen I designed it to be just
22<00:04:45.580> inches<00:04:45.940> by<00:04:46.120> 30<00:04:46.539> inches<00:04:46.690> so<00:04:47.289> it's<00:04:47.440> very<00:04:47.680> tiny

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:48.009 
22 inches by 30 inches so it's very tiny

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:50.430 
22 inches by 30 inches so it's very tiny
but<00:04:48.520> it<00:04:48.639> is<00:04:48.819> deep<00:04:49.090> so<00:04:49.509> it's<00:04:49.720> sort<00:04:50.289> of<00:04:50.319> a

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
but it is deep so it's sort of a

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.999 
but it is deep so it's sort of a
japanese-style<00:04:51.009> thing<00:04:51.990> module<00:04:52.990> is<00:04:53.169> good<00:04:53.560> in

feet<00:05:54.580> would<00:05:55.029> be<00:05:55.860> about<00:05:56.860> 15<00:05:57.340> of<00:05:57.490> these<00:05:58.440> so<00:05:59.440> uh

00:05:59.459 --> 00:05:59.469 
feet would be about 15 of these so uh

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:01.860 
feet would be about 15 of these so uh
yeah<00:06:00.190> we<00:06:00.370> got<00:06:00.520> a<00:06:00.550> ways<00:06:00.729> we<00:06:00.909> could<00:06:01.090> go<00:06:01.150> down<00:06:01.300> we

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
yeah we got a ways we could go down we

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.379 
yeah we got a ways we could go down we
lost<00:06:02.110> our<00:06:02.380> house<00:06:02.560> do<00:06:03.250> the<00:06:03.279> economy<00:06:03.969> and<00:06:04.150> so

lost our house do the economy and so

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:07.140 
lost our house do the economy and so
we're<00:06:04.779> thinking<00:06:05.349> that<00:06:05.699> when<00:06:06.699> it's<00:06:06.849> time<00:06:07.120> to

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
we're thinking that when it's time to

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.029 
we're thinking that when it's time to
own<00:06:07.539> again<00:06:07.900> we'd<00:06:08.110> like<00:06:08.139> to<00:06:08.349> go<00:06:08.620> with<00:06:08.800> something

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:09.039 
own again we'd like to go with something

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:11.850 
own again we'd like to go with something
that<00:06:09.400> is<00:06:09.789> practical<00:06:10.060> and<00:06:10.569> affordable<00:06:11.110> and

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 
that is practical and affordable and

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:18.360 
that is practical and affordable and
wouldn't<00:06:12.610> be<00:06:12.639> lost<00:06:16.889> this<00:06:17.889> one<00:06:18.099> would<00:06:18.279> actually

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370 
wouldn't be lost this one would actually

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.490 
wouldn't be lost this one would actually
be<00:06:18.699> only<00:06:18.880> as<00:06:19.389> a<00:06:19.449> shell<00:06:19.810> you<00:06:19.840> could<00:06:20.229> buy<00:06:20.349> it<00:06:20.409> for

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
be only as a shell you could buy it for

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.860 
be only as a shell you could buy it for
about<00:06:20.680> eleven<00:06:21.520> thousand<00:06:21.940> dollars<00:06:21.969> but<00:06:22.690> then

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:22.870 
about eleven thousand dollars but then

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.570 
about eleven thousand dollars but then
if<00:06:23.020> you<00:06:23.139> want<00:06:23.349> to<00:06:23.440> check<00:06:23.889> it<00:06:24.039> out<00:06:24.130> you<00:06:24.279> get<00:06:24.400> the

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.580 
if you want to check it out you get the

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.309 
if you want to check it out you get the
components<00:06:25.150> for<00:06:25.270> maybe<00:06:25.479> a<00:06:25.569> couple<00:06:25.840> thousand

00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:26.319 
components for maybe a couple thousand

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:27.149 
components for maybe a couple thousand
dollars<00:06:26.349> each

00:06:27.149 --> 00:06:27.159 
dollars each

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:28.740 
dollars each
I<00:06:27.190> think<00:06:27.490> the<00:06:27.610> bathroom<00:06:28.029> in<00:06:28.180> the<00:06:28.210> kitchen<00:06:28.270> and

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:28.750 
I think the bathroom in the kitchen and

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.680 
I think the bathroom in the kitchen and
then<00:06:29.620> you've<00:06:29.770> got<00:06:29.979> yourself<00:06:30.430> a<00:06:30.580> house<00:06:30.759> that's

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:31.690 
then you've got yourself a house that's

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.040 
then you've got yourself a house that's
my<00:06:31.990> book

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.050

the recession came along people couldn't

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:41.439 
the recession came along people couldn't
quite<00:06:39.409> afford<00:06:39.590> the<00:06:40.069> shift<00:06:40.759> to<00:06:40.970> a<00:06:41.000> small<00:06:41.240> house

00:06:43.149 --> 00:06:43.159 
but they could start thinking about how

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:44.230 
but they could start thinking about how
they're<00:06:43.340> going<00:06:43.460> to<00:06:43.520> simplify<00:06:43.909> their<00:06:44.090> lives

would be hard to you know to get rid of
the<00:07:45.020> stuff<00:07:45.229> but<00:07:45.409> then<00:07:45.590> yeah<00:07:45.860> it's<00:07:46.729> intriguing
