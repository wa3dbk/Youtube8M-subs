00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 how to create one with your own hands 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.350
 beauty and knock them bead slando morning 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.200
 good morning hello tell 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.500
 truth how crazy you are 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.859
 do it yourself alone 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.869
 this years is literally right yes 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:21.660
 let's pens your pounded with these 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.359
 hands such giant flowers 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.519
 even St. George ribbons all-all-all 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.710
 you do it with your short handles 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.380
 tell us where to start can be to 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.010
 learn how to do it I started auto transporter you 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.380
 I bought my book I will not take emulki 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.510
 appeared only 7 years after 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.250
 how I bought the first foreign book 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.960
 author about trees and flowers from beads and 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.730
 start from its first tree which 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.129
 I still keep well here 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.649
 here 's a description of connotation in a book 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.930
 described that there are several types 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.870
 in beads several types of french 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.050
 to 1 bead weaving on here tell 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.910
 What technicians do you have? 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.799
 scream is common basic technology 4 here's how 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.080
 four times in my book 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.570
 different products but because four 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.890
 equipment and each product is made in 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.330
 different technique then this looped technique 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.729
 simple loop here for example these 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.040
 studs in it are made this crossed 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:25.040
 loops you can make daisies in such 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:28.170
 engineering loop these violets and 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.310
 weaving arcs around the axis is roses and 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.930
 this is my favorite technique 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.890
 craftswoman see heavy attention 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.520
 on geometry 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.369
 arc loop wears she came to us in 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.860
 studio ready to tell hay exactly 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.520
 show a small master class I look 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.710
 we have here more blanks which 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.479
 we can help you now 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.380
 to spoil 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:58.510
 so what does weave start with 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.210
 weaving in french beadwork 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:04.479
 starts with a set of beads on a wire 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.940
 and for that I brought yes it already 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.429
 ready I will not set the recruited bowl 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.300
 for this I brought 20 worlds in which 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.000
 need to pour out 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.970
 and low and spinner and everything is very simple 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.250
 so easy her past is special 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.730
 cup that you guard beads there 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.250
 yes this is a Czech device I 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.410
 I use Czech beads so here we are 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.560
 covered our beads with beads and then 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.590
 what and then you need to take the delay and 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:41.019
 type beads on the wire but I already 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:43.600
 see you scored 3 meters now I will unravel 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:47.110
 tell it then wire it 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.030
 there must be some kind of special without knowing 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.670
 thickness some special can be 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.280
 wildebeest some kind of special thing 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.870
 the main thing is to be copper wire 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:00.310
 that is, it should be well bend 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:02.760
 supple and obedient i usually 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.950
 I use 0 fifth wire for weaving 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.430
 to keep the product in good shape and not 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.660
 were crumpled 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.489
 expelled this section bombed mida yes and 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.799
 diameter 0 3 millimeters for firmware 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:18.070
 weave you here for example every leaf 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:20.110
 should be stitched for him to hold 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.180
 yes, look , first of all 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.560
 straighten the wire so that it is 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.750
 ideal for straightening 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.640
 I slowed down the wire here if 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.280
 correctly understood how it is called 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.250
 soft lips only fools everybody knows the floor 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.690
 bang it gently myagenkie for merchants 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.820
 order not to damage the wire 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.709
 correctly all the more wire on the bar 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.019
 Let me show you it first 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.910
 bar square wire often crumpled 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:46.170
 so we count it so and 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:51.120
 conduct and wire at a time 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:54.080
 correct perfectly straightened then we 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.700
 doing here such as the main hook 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.830
 we undertake somewhere at a distance of 10 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.130
 centimeters from it and start 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:05.569
 spin the spinner so that the beads 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.569
 went to meet this hook 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.880
 yes if you had to type 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.430
 manually i.e. it took 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.010
 the lion's share of time before 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.620
 start getting started weaving now 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:22.710
 it's already literally minutes and 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:25.770
 then you sit quietly and spit well 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.570
 let's then continue the madapole grid 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.600
 and to work relatively speaking, we collected 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:33.600
 three meters in a ribbon on our beads 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:39.600
 and already from this tape we have me so 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:42.479
 I understand how much weave should be created 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:46.970
 the winter has already received both stopped 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:51.470
 first, the main thing is, well, and then manage 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:54.120
 send well okay all the empire is gone 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:56.729
 we start to weave so we for weaving 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.130
 you will need another ruler to 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:01.169
 measure the required number of centimeters 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.560
 First we make a small loop on 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:07.910
 the end of the wire then measure five with 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:14.220
 half centimeters is the width 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:18.330
 adrenaline length is such a here . 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:21.390
 we will make a gift bow later 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.830
 I make a loop I usually do a little 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.330
 eyelet so that four fingers 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.340
 were placed 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.099
 for this scheme you need to do 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:32.189
 large enough loop then 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:35.340
 I will explain why and begin to twist it 

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:38.069
 This is how it is with us 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.650
 turned axis central row 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:44.000
 it will be and now we will start around it 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:46.500
 weave the arc from left to right that is here 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.969
 we spread near the central water 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:53.400
 next to another arc remove extra beads 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:56.400
 and nothing twists around the axis 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.830
 throughout and then again lay out already 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.449
 on right 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.250
 the next arc we remove the excess cheese and 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:03.569
 spin see how much time it is 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.270
 takes it anyway this painstaking 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:10.050
 It works much time you have spent here on 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:11.120
 this miracle this miracle took me about two 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.159
 months 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:17.340
 two months of working on it 

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:20.460
 booker but this is in view of the fact that I 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:23.909
 it was necessary to come up with first but usually I 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:26.550
 I think in my head I present the products later 

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:28.770
 I do some test petals and often 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:33.080
 it turns out they immediately go into products 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:35.729
 the hardest job is your well one of 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:39.319
 a little something in can be ordered 

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:42.150
 some giant do not know ficus 

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:45.270
 three-meter natural value most 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:48.599
 My big job is forsythia meter 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:51.389
 in height to floor composition this 

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:53.879
 generally forsythia bush that we have there with 

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:56.159
 our petals get 0 and 1 ready 

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:59.759
 up to 1 gram will not show the viewers 

00:06:56.159 --> 00:07:01.680
 here is just a minute mountain and Dasha 

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:04.020
 the main thing could make such a petal 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.710
 from which it will be possible later 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.589
 to twist 

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:10.909
 loop and make just such a beauty 

00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:14.770
 then it will be a bow and then 

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:16.330
 there will be a big bow right which 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:21.879
 can you see see try on 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:25.870
 present yes there is such a violinist for 

00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:30.599
 hair on and accordingly well in general it 

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:35.520
 as here so here and it is possible still here so 

00:07:30.599 --> 00:07:35.520
 Well, you can here this feud
