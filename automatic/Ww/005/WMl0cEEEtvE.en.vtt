00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.010
 jbeil's escape button is so 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:48.410

 not touch your device because escape 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.970
 and is taking the data 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.230
 of your device for the tiebreak and 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.650
 well you will need 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.170
 to intervene during two breaks for 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.740
 unlock your device once 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:14.550
 for escape then installed completely 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.590
 so cydia downloads them if there is and 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.720
 all the applications that go with 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.360
 you must not touch other 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.210
 devices once a message is going 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.440
 blink like these it's going to have to 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.030

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.710
