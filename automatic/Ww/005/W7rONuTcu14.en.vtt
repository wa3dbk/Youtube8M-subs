00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
actually in the process of thinking

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.740 
actually in the process of thinking
about<00:00:58.260> transitioning<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.340> natural<00:00:59.489> hair<00:00:59.940> um

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
about transitioning to natural hair um

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.349 
about transitioning to natural hair um
the<00:01:01.079> last<00:01:01.260> time<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.530> got<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:02.000> relaxer<00:01:03.000> was<00:01:03.149> in

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
the last time I got a relaxer was in

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.390 
the last time I got a relaxer was in
July<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.080> I'm<00:01:04.170> really<00:01:04.379> thinking<00:01:04.559> about<00:01:04.860> just

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
July and I'm really thinking about just

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.700 
July and I'm really thinking about just
going<00:01:06.330> natural<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.170> think<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.530> will<00:01:07.650> be

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
going natural and I think it will be

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.410 
going natural and I think it will be
better<00:01:07.890> for<00:01:08.100> my<00:01:08.220> hair<00:01:08.460> because<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.150> don't

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
better for my hair because I don't

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.060 
better for my hair because I don't
really<00:01:09.630> need<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.110> be<00:01:10.320> relaxed<00:01:10.890> and

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
really need it to be relaxed and

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.070 
really need it to be relaxed and
actually<00:01:11.939> at<00:01:12.030> some<00:01:12.210> points<00:01:12.600> it's<00:01:12.750> kind<00:01:12.990> of

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
actually at some points it's kind of

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.440 
actually at some points it's kind of
causing<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.740> break<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.549> that's<00:01:15.030> why<00:01:15.240> I'm

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
causing it to break so that's why I'm

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.030 
causing it to break so that's why I'm
thinking<00:01:15.479> about<00:01:15.869> going<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.259> with<00:01:16.439> this<00:01:16.560> hair<00:01:16.860> I

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
thinking about going so with this hair I

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.679 
thinking about going so with this hair I
just<00:01:17.340> shampooed<00:01:17.790> my<00:01:17.820> hair<00:01:18.030> with<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.420> and

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
just shampooed my hair with it and

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.230 
just shampooed my hair with it and
honestly<00:01:19.110> it's<00:01:19.710> not<00:01:19.890> like<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:20.430> really<00:01:20.670> hate<00:01:21.210> to

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
honestly it's not like I really hate to

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.660 
honestly it's not like I really hate to
you<00:01:21.479> shampoos<00:01:21.930> because<00:01:21.960> they<00:01:22.590> dry<00:01:23.070> out<00:01:23.369> my

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
you shampoos because they dry out my

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.730 
you shampoos because they dry out my
hair<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.240> bad<00:01:24.600> especially<00:01:24.869> because<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.439> have<00:01:25.560> a

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
hair so bad especially because I have a

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.570 
hair so bad especially because I have a
relaxer

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
relaxer

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.399

but<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.030> shampoo<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.659> did<00:01:27.840> not<00:01:27.960> dry<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.290> out

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409

actually<00:03:12.190> double<00:03:12.430> it<00:03:12.700> so<00:03:13.030> that<00:03:13.180> way<00:03:13.300> I<00:03:13.330> know

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
actually double it so that way I know

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.720 
actually double it so that way I know
I'm<00:03:13.959> getting<00:03:14.200> all<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.800> nutrients<00:03:15.220> into<00:03:15.640> my

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
I'm getting all the nutrients into my

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.610 
I'm getting all the nutrients into my
hair<00:03:15.970> so<00:03:16.420> I<00:03:16.450> actually<00:03:16.810> left<00:03:17.170> it<00:03:17.320> for<00:03:17.410> about

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
hair so I actually left it for about

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.740 
hair so I actually left it for about
five<00:03:17.950> to<00:03:18.160> ten<00:03:18.370> minutes<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:18.850> then<00:03:19.209> I<00:03:19.239> rinse<00:03:19.570> it

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
five to ten minutes and then I rinse it

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.020 
five to ten minutes and then I rinse it
out<00:03:19.959> now<00:03:20.320> this<00:03:20.560> stuff<00:03:20.770> right<00:03:20.980> here<00:03:21.040> it<00:03:21.610> smells

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
out now this stuff right here it smells

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.880 
out now this stuff right here it smells
kind<00:03:22.420> of<00:03:22.510> like<00:03:22.630> this<00:03:22.959> one<00:03:23.140> but<00:03:23.290> it<00:03:23.380> has<00:03:23.410> more<00:03:23.800> of

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
kind of like this one but it has more of

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.800 
kind of like this one but it has more of
a<00:03:23.980> sweeter<00:03:24.340> smell<00:03:24.670> and<00:03:25.000> I<00:03:25.180> think<00:03:25.450> that's<00:03:25.600> just

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
a sweeter smell and I think that's just

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.600 
a sweeter smell and I think that's just
because<00:03:26.200> of<00:03:26.350> the<00:03:26.470> jojoba<00:03:26.650> oils<00:03:27.280> that<00:03:27.430> are<00:03:27.489> in

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
because of the jojoba oils that are in

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.240 
because of the jojoba oils that are in
it<00:03:27.850> but<00:03:28.660> I<00:03:28.870> like<00:03:29.110> this<00:03:29.320> smell<00:03:29.440> actually<00:03:29.770> smells

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
it but I like this smell actually smells

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.650 
it but I like this smell actually smells
a<00:03:30.370> little<00:03:30.580> bit<00:03:30.700> stronger<00:03:31.030> than<00:03:31.270> that<00:03:31.300> one

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
a little bit stronger than that one

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.750 
a little bit stronger than that one
which<00:03:31.870> is<00:03:32.020> good<00:03:32.290> it<00:03:32.560> actually<00:03:32.770> really<00:03:33.400> brings

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
which is good it actually really brings

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.020 
which is good it actually really brings
out<00:03:34.030> that<00:03:34.090> nice<00:03:34.860> sweet<00:03:35.860> like<00:03:36.610> it's<00:03:36.850> not<00:03:36.970> a

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
out that nice sweet like it's not a

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.320 
out that nice sweet like it's not a
floral<00:03:37.810> smell<00:03:37.989> it's<00:03:38.380> more<00:03:38.620> like<00:03:38.830> aloe<00:03:39.640> vera<00:03:40.060> it

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
floral smell it's more like aloe vera it

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.670 
floral smell it's more like aloe vera it
smells<00:03:40.600> really<00:03:40.870> good<00:03:41.110> this<00:03:41.350> is<00:03:41.530> their

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
what's going on when I bleach them in

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.890 
what's going on when I bleach them in
stuff<00:05:44.020> but<00:05:44.650> I<00:05:44.920> realized<00:05:45.820> that<00:05:46.030> the<00:05:46.330> hair<00:05:46.630> that

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
stuff but I realized that the hair that

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.210 
stuff but I realized that the hair that
I<00:05:46.990> had<00:05:47.110> bleach<00:05:47.350> must<00:05:47.680> not<00:05:47.860> have<00:05:48.040> been<00:05:48.160> a

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
I had bleach must not have been a

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.220 
I had bleach must not have been a
hundred<00:05:48.550> percent<00:05:48.640> human<00:05:49.150> hair<00:05:49.210> because<00:05:50.050> it

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:50.230 
hundred percent human hair because it

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.500 
hundred percent human hair because it
wasn't<00:05:50.650> giving<00:05:50.920> me<00:05:51.040> that<00:05:51.190> bright<00:05:51.640> look<00:05:52.240> that

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:52.510 
wasn't giving me that bright look that

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.170 
wasn't giving me that bright look that
you<00:05:52.840> usually<00:05:52.990> get<00:05:53.350> from<00:05:53.590> bleaching<00:05:54.010> hair<00:05:54.250> but

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
you usually get from bleaching hair but

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.420 
you usually get from bleaching hair but
I<00:05:55.390> think<00:05:55.810> I<00:05:55.930> probably<00:05:56.320> would<00:05:56.860> have<00:05:56.950> ruined<00:05:57.130> my

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
I think I probably would have ruined my

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.370 
I think I probably would have ruined my
hair<00:05:57.670> if<00:05:57.880> I<00:05:58.030> had<00:05:58.240> not<00:05:58.420> used<00:05:58.600> these<00:05:58.840> products<00:05:59.230> on

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
hair if I had not used these products on

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.560 
hair if I had not used these products on
it<00:05:59.500> because<00:05:59.830> after<00:06:00.370> I<00:06:00.700> had<00:06:00.970> bleached<00:06:01.210> it<00:06:01.360> it

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.570 
it because after I had bleached it it

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:04.920
