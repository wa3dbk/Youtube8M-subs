old<00:00:15.639> BPD<00:00:16.320> gear<00:00:17.520> just<00:00:18.520> a<00:00:18.670> little<00:00:18.880> overview<00:00:19.150> on

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.330 
old BPD gear just a little overview on

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.769 
old BPD gear just a little overview on
what<00:00:19.480> the<00:00:19.599> VPD<00:00:20.020> is<00:00:20.529> is<00:00:20.860> it's<00:00:21.070> it's<00:00:21.610> it's<00:00:22.540> a<00:00:22.570> very

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:22.779 
what the VPD is is it's it's it's a very

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.159 
what the VPD is is it's it's it's a very
moldable<00:00:24.029> type<00:00:25.029> of<00:00:25.180> foam<00:00:25.390> but<00:00:25.989> it<00:00:26.079> is

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:26.169 
moldable type of foam but it is

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:28.139 
moldable type of foam but it is
extremely<00:00:26.980> dense<00:00:27.250> so<00:00:27.759> what<00:00:27.970> they're<00:00:28.119> trying

00:00:28.139 --> 00:00:28.149 
extremely dense so what they're trying

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:29.880 
extremely dense so what they're trying
to<00:00:28.540> create<00:00:28.779> with<00:00:29.050> this<00:00:29.320> is<00:00:29.559> the<00:00:29.739> most

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
to create with this is the most

to create with this is the most
comfortable<00:00:30.369> protection<00:00:30.939> but<00:00:31.570> the<00:00:31.660> same<00:00:31.869> time

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
done with their new gear is one can't

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.229 
done with their new gear is one can't
see<00:00:47.379> it<00:00:47.469> but<00:00:47.620> they've<00:00:47.859> perforated<00:00:48.670> the<00:00:48.699> the

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
see it but they've perforated the the

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.360 
see it but they've perforated the the
VPD<00:00:49.600> foam<00:00:49.960> so<00:00:50.769> there's<00:00:50.949> little<00:00:51.219> holes

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
VPD foam so there's little holes

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.650 
VPD foam so there's little holes
throughout<00:00:51.730> it<00:00:51.969> so<00:00:52.089> it's<00:00:52.210> going<00:00:52.300> to<00:00:52.359> make<00:00:52.480> it<00:00:52.600> a

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
throughout it so it's going to make it a

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.540 
throughout it so it's going to make it a
lot<00:00:52.809> more<00:00:52.839> breathable<00:00:53.999> and<00:00:54.999> not<00:00:55.480> quite<00:00:55.780> as<00:00:55.899> hot

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
lot more breathable and not quite as hot

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.349 
lot more breathable and not quite as hot
another<00:00:57.550> thing<00:00:57.730> they've<00:00:57.850> done<00:00:57.879> is<00:00:58.059> they've

00:00:58.349 --> 00:00:58.359 
another thing they've done is they've

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:02.279 
another thing they've done is they've
made<00:00:58.539> it<00:00:59.339> to<00:01:00.339> deal<00:01:00.760> better<00:01:00.969> than<00:01:01.089> the<00:01:01.239> cold<00:01:01.569> the

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 
made it to deal better than the cold the

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:04.410 
made it to deal better than the cold the
older<00:01:02.739> stuff<00:01:02.980> when<00:01:03.219> it<00:01:03.339> got<00:01:03.429> cold<00:01:03.699> it<00:01:03.999> kind<00:01:04.360> of

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
older stuff when it got cold it kind of

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.420 
older stuff when it got cold it kind of
got<00:01:04.570> hard<00:01:04.900> and<00:01:05.260> it<00:01:05.379> wasn't<00:01:05.650> as<00:01:06.070> movable

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
got hard and it wasn't as movable

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.330 
got hard and it wasn't as movable
they've<00:01:07.420> upgraded<00:01:07.630> this<00:01:08.110> stuff<00:01:08.380> and<00:01:09.040> so<00:01:09.189> it's

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
they've upgraded this stuff and so it's

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.880 
they've upgraded this stuff and so it's
going<00:01:09.460> to<00:01:09.520> be<00:01:09.670> a<00:01:10.020> lot<00:01:11.020> better<00:01:11.229> to<00:01:11.470> use<00:01:11.680> in<00:01:11.829> the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
going to be a lot better to use in the

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.639 
going to be a lot better to use in the
cold<00:01:12.130> for<00:01:12.430> skiing<00:01:12.700> snowmobiling

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:13.649 
cold for skiing snowmobiling

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:15.990 
cold for skiing snowmobiling
snowboarding<00:01:14.649> and<00:01:14.799> those<00:01:15.369> types<00:01:15.610> of<00:01:15.759> sports

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
snowboarding and those types of sports

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.730 
snowboarding and those types of sports
another<00:01:16.869> thing<00:01:17.110> they've<00:01:17.259> done<00:01:17.439> is<00:01:17.560> they've

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
another thing they've done is they've

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.100 
another thing they've done is they've
they've<00:01:18.340> made<00:01:18.549> it<00:01:18.640> more<00:01:18.759> tear<00:01:19.060> resistant<00:01:19.600> so

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
they've made it more tear resistant so

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.780 
they've made it more tear resistant so
it's<00:01:20.259> going<00:01:20.380> to<00:01:20.439> last<00:01:20.619> a<00:01:20.860> lot<00:01:21.009> longer<00:01:21.070> it's<00:01:21.640> not

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
it's going to last a lot longer it's not

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.910 
it's going to last a lot longer it's not
going<00:01:22.000> to<00:01:22.060> tear<00:01:22.270> on<00:01:22.450> you<00:01:22.630> it's<00:01:22.810> supposed<00:01:23.079> to<00:01:23.229> to

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
going to tear on you it's supposed to to

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.399 
going to tear on you it's supposed to to
withstand<00:01:24.130> any<00:01:24.610> type<00:01:24.939> of<00:01:25.119> any<00:01:25.810> type<00:01:26.020> of<00:01:26.049> action

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
withstand any type of any type of action

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.280 
withstand any type of any type of action
you're<00:01:26.560> going<00:01:26.680> to<00:01:26.740> throw<00:01:27.009> at<00:01:27.189> it<00:01:27.930> so<00:01:28.930> that<00:01:28.960> is

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
you're going to throw at it so that is

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.789 
you're going to throw at it so that is
the<00:01:29.439> differences<00:01:29.890> between<00:01:30.100> the<00:01:30.430> new<00:01:31.530> 2.0<00:01:32.530> and

the differences between the new 2.0 and
the<00:01:32.979> old<00:01:33.159> it's<00:01:33.969> going<00:01:34.119> to<00:01:34.180> be<00:01:34.240> a<00:01:34.270> lot<00:01:34.479> a<00:01:34.689> lot

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
the old it's going to be a lot a lot

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.100 
the old it's going to be a lot a lot
lighter<00:01:35.909> perforated<00:01:36.909> for<00:01:37.030> breathability<00:01:37.600> and

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
lighter perforated for breathability and

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.200 
lighter perforated for breathability and
these<00:01:38.530> are<00:01:38.680> the<00:01:38.770> three<00:01:38.920> that<00:01:39.070> I<00:01:39.100> have<00:01:39.310> here

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
these are the three that I have here

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.060 
these are the three that I have here
this<00:01:40.390> is<00:01:40.570> their<00:01:40.689> new<00:01:40.869> knee<00:01:41.140> they've<00:01:41.860> done<00:01:42.039> a

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
this is their new knee they've done a

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.580 
this is their new knee they've done a
little<00:01:42.520> bit<00:01:42.640> design<00:01:42.939> with<00:01:43.719> the<00:01:43.840> green<00:01:44.110> graphic

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
little bit design with the green graphic

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:45.870 
little bit design with the green graphic
on<00:01:44.740> it<00:01:44.860> so<00:01:45.039> that's<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.280> knee<00:01:45.430> and<00:01:45.610> they've<00:01:45.729> got

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
on it so that's the knee and they've got

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.149 
on it so that's the knee and they've got
an<00:01:45.969> extended<00:01:46.479> knee<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:47.740> this<00:01:47.859> is<00:01:47.950> eight

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
an extended knee so this is eight

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.160 
an extended knee so this is eight
millimeters<00:01:48.670> longer<00:01:48.909> than<00:01:49.479> the<00:01:49.600> regular<00:01:49.990> knee

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
millimeters longer than the regular knee

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.349 
millimeters longer than the regular knee
and<00:01:51.009> then<00:01:51.189> another<00:01:51.460> brand<00:01:51.880> new<00:01:51.969> thing<00:01:52.240> that

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:52.359 
and then another brand new thing that

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:55.529
