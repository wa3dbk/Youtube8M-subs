 [Music] 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.700
 these more readings among all 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.440
 Fridays recoba now study the 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.930
 high-end leather jacket of the 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.660
 dainese mark and the name of this blues on 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.570
 know the nude she marc pellet so the 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.509
 lionel martenet is a jacket with 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.360
 incrire leather skins leather skins 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:36.030
 very flexible used on jackets 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.720
 leather needs or combinations a 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.010
 piece of competition because it is very 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.840
 resistant and very flexible the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.320
 flexibility if we will find it 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.280
 thanks to the fabric is this a calculation is a 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:54.150
 very durable fabric and at a level 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:57.180
 defect of the leather fireplaces we have 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:00.330
 behind each shoulder blade the 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.640
 blues roots characterization we're going 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:06.540
 also find yourself in the bump a 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.610
 hump at an ergonomic function largo 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.259
 nomic and aerodynamic as well 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.710
 normally in the straight line of the 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.900
 circuit so the position is a motorcycle 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.060
 sporty for this jacket there so it must 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.400
 to be a little bit like that so the road 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.400
 to the exact shape to complete well 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.680
 gasquet and to have a good time 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:29.640
 aerodynamics were in the track and not 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.320
 to move too much with the optional head by 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.930
 from the front I was also told about the 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.729
 cervical protection so we see it 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.890
 not a lot but that starts to 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.680
 inside by the interior of the hall 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.080
 is this cervical protection is at the 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.210
 once rigid but flexible table that 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.640
 accompanies well the movement of the coup 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.240
 it will also protect the area from 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.140
 men in place 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.540
 she does not normally like but you 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.229
 should know that if it moves it so 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.360
 as always when lifting his cover 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.530
 so at the level of the blow we will have a 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.159
 double double 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.110
 closing for much bigger more 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.709
 big or want to put a ride 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:14.580
 of neck if we open we see that it is a 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.980
 jacket with 3d 3d lining of the bumble 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.790
 3d bubble liner thus has an effect 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:23.370
 insulation of cold or show this is a 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.630
 lining as we see who has small 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.750
 round this little novel makes them their 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.270
 functions it's going to be keeping your 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:34.950
 own body heat and so of 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:39.390
 create a clean air chamber for you 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.340
 to maintain either things are not fresh 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.200
 but fortunately our killer opera 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.360
 body-level pouch by 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.440
 example you see we have a cover 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.739
 for papers 1 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.410
 this area there the right zone and also one 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:55.110
 always find fault closing 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.360
 tisseyre flash to attach 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.989
 pants that sells by separating the 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.010
 snow line 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:04.920
 so all with the ax and an attached one 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.500
 look like we have a nice combination of 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.829
 pieces a combination of pieces and a 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.160
 enough combination of a range to his 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.019
 hosts 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.530
 we will also find you for your 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:19.980
 security also a reflective tape 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.079
 here and at the level of the logo of the bump to 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.360
 the rear 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:26.760

 most fascinating range the one that is going 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.030
 understand 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:39.290
 at the technical level the must buy you 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.290
