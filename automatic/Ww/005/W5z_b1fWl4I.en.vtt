that don't sell as much and that's the
crux<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.820> issue<00:02:05.899> genius<00:02:06.899> of<00:02:07.049> natty<00:02:07.259> has

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
crux of the issue genius of natty has

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.309 
crux of the issue genius of natty has
nailed<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:08.039> right<00:02:08.610> there<00:02:08.940> because<00:02:09.660> that's

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
nailed it right there because that's

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.620 
nailed it right there because that's
exactly<00:02:10.500> what<00:02:11.129> my<00:02:11.160> problem<00:02:11.790> is<00:02:11.970> 9

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
exactly what my problem is 9

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
to me it's fleecing the market and

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.220 
to me it's fleecing the market and
that's<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.120> crux<00:02:42.330> of<00:02:42.570> the<00:02:42.690> issue<00:02:42.720> here<00:02:43.110> and

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
that's the crux of the issue here and

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.380 
that's the crux of the issue here and
this<00:02:43.290> is<00:02:43.410> why<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:43.560> don't<00:02:43.830> understand<00:02:44.310> why<00:02:45.030> canon

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
this is why I don't understand why canon

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.690 
this is why I don't understand why canon
fans<00:02:45.660> can<00:02:46.110> and<00:02:46.260> faithful<00:02:46.680> canon<00:02:47.010> fanboys<00:02:47.490> are

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
fans can and faithful canon fanboys are

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.730 
fans can and faithful canon fanboys are
so<00:02:48.390> defensive<00:02:49.140> when<00:02:49.430> cannon<00:02:50.430> is<00:02:50.550> essentially

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
so defensive when cannon is essentially

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.860 
so defensive when cannon is essentially
