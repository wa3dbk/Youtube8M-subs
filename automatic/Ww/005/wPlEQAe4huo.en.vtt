00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.390 

I'm<00:04:08.670> kind<00:04:09.150> of<00:04:09.270> surprised<00:04:09.630> that<00:04:10.220> the<00:04:11.220> owner

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
I'm kind of surprised that the owner

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.820 
I'm kind of surprised that the owner
even<00:04:12.060> would<00:04:12.780> allow<00:04:12.990> the<00:04:13.050> car<00:04:13.380> to<00:04:13.410> sit<00:04:13.680> out<00:04:13.800> in

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
even would allow the car to sit out in

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.330 
even would allow the car to sit out in
the<00:04:13.980> snow

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.780 

not<00:04:17.340> my<00:04:17.489> choice<00:04:17.730> though<00:04:18.030> I<00:04:19.280> suppose<00:04:20.280> once<00:04:20.640> I

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
not my choice though I suppose once I

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.250 
not my choice though I suppose once I
have<00:04:20.910> it<00:04:21.030> running<00:04:21.209> and<00:04:21.450> driving<00:04:21.630> it<00:04:21.989> won't<00:04:22.140> be

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
have it running and driving it won't be

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.590 
have it running and driving it won't be
out<00:04:22.350> in<00:04:22.470> the<00:04:22.530> snow<00:04:22.590> anymore<00:04:23.210> of<00:04:24.210> course<00:04:24.270> it's

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
out in the snow anymore of course it's

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.760 
out in the snow anymore of course it's
not<00:04:24.690> really<00:04:24.780> gonna<00:04:25.050> get<00:04:25.230> hurt<00:04:25.410> from<00:04:25.500> just

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
not really gonna get hurt from just

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.130 
not really gonna get hurt from just
sitting<00:04:26.010> around<00:04:26.540> it's<00:04:27.540> not<00:04:27.750> being<00:04:27.990> driven

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
sitting around it's not being driven

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.680 
sitting around it's not being driven
anywhere<00:04:28.470> no<00:04:29.310> salt<00:04:30.380> so<00:04:31.380> that's<00:04:32.130> it<00:04:32.250> for<00:04:32.400> now

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
anywhere no salt so that's it for now

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.350 
anywhere no salt so that's it for now
