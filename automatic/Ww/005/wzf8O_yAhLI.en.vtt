00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 hey this is a piece of meat from 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.259
 Pine with a parmesan and mafia cafe 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.690
 rapp crust and I did that 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.260
 that he followed in the wake of barbecue 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.160
 rheinhessen 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.160
 have lots of fun with it 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.140
 Here you see all the ingredients we do 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.969
 for our area of sound date 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.710
 parmesan mafia cup europe largest 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.149
 Of course we need to get started 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.850
 I have a flush steak here 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:55.970
 ordered from juwi then we need one 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.159
 rub parmesan from markus mafia cafe 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.640
 rapp and of course a preheated 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:00:59.899
 deliver 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.670
 But I'll start with that first 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.379
 i here that plants backup pots and 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.820
 then we'll meet again 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.369
 I'm coming to the preparation of the long 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.190
 sticks as you can see the plastic 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:13.610
 is the same size as the grill grid 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.170
 deeper that fits so well and the 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.030
 hard preparation is very important 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.920
 just that you wanted to offer it if s 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.710
 that you print it with it before 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.899
 no excess moisture on the 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.119
 surface is because that would have you 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:27.830
 slipped first heat before she 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.020
 That's why Rösler Woman cares 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.130
 the best of money in general even if 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.170
 he is supposed to do it on the grill or 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.360
 also the key zone just the please 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.860
 humidity under pressure and now take 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.630
 get a sharp knife and pull 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.940
 such little carvings really 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.550
 do not cut deep just like that 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.470
 I do not know two millimeters or 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.770
 It's just that 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.840
 For one, that's not her then 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.090
 can contract and on the other hand that 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.190
 later if our crust from the 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.229
 mafia cup with parmesan on it comes that 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.610
 the just more attack art 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.229
 speak so better and can hold and 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.959
 not directly back down that runs 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.060
 meat lid not salted before 

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:09.920
 or somehow spiced but us 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.280
 just use the spices 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.450
 or the components of the 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:20.379
 raps to sit then finally 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.379
 if it goes wrong 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.490
 before our frank now on the beamer 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.770
 I'll have the parmesan soon 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.490
 because not all at once 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.170
 real quick 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.319
 That's why I have a piece here now 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:37.020
 parmesan as I rub my beautiful thing 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:37.020
 down where I I rub with the sample 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:45.610
 think that should be completely outside and there 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:48.819
 then comes a tablespoon of the mafia 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.560
 coffee from don marco with buy there is like 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.750
 also said salt in there and therefore 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.680
 that will be the plaster the whole 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:59.170
 must the north through and now s 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.480
 run provider so the bi almost not 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:07.380
 preheated and then it goes on now 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:11.370
 our flank with the ifa cam and then 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.370
 push it now into the deliver 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.129
 a little bit higher now 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:40.230
 So looking can see so the first 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.470
 roasted flavors come on little what 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.470
 still 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:54.580
 but then it's all over 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:57.420
 fast as it looks so far now 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.420
 short tricks 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.730
 and back in 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:24.450
 so frank mountain is clever and now 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:26.490
 comes our parmesan crust on it 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.340
 First time the daddy say the crisis 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.200
 then the crust becomes the choice 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:39.620
 I have now on the smallest level 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:43.260
 put and put that franck now 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.560
 down in the libraries and leave it there 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:50.160
 even pull 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:53.370
 fantastic then it is now on the 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:59.580
 time our meat from the beaver 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:05:01.910
 It looks fantastic 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.910
 out 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.970
 then it is finally time 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.860
 this fantastic flassbeck 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.690

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.720

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:28.100

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:40.430
 Take a look you can see 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:42.010
 inside it is still beautiful pink the beautiful 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.400

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.340
