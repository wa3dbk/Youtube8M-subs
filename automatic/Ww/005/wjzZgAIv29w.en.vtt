00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:17.880
 hello to everyone 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.420
 Sergey and in today's issue you 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.420
 will see 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:31.320
 and today I will cook for you 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.550
 protein shake but he will 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.640
 a little bit unusual 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:41.910
 I will make this cocktail on the hunt 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.269
 so charge from knin plus you will get 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:52.230
 I loved to add and created as 1 year 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:55.949
 coffee or water peanut butter itself 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.420
 protein and a little heinz new ask 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.970
 how is it different from the usual 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.870
 stretched to their taste 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.970
 and energy value as composition 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.900
 skin which gives energy 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.540
 plus gives the usual taste also in the composition 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.810
 includes peanut butter which contains 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.900
 healthy fats are the most protein which 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.170
 contains useful protein i use 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.979
 vanilla flavor and a little cinnamon 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:29.100
 separation again taste 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:33.830
 so let's start cooking for us to start 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.830
 you need to make coffee and now you are going 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.340
 so expensive for lucky our coffee is ready and 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:55.240
 now we need to cool it and in this 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.240
 led will help us 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:06.610
 we beat it all up 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.750
 the coffee we cooled to our 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.940
 protein 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.880
 did not coagulate at high temperature 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.580
 water since you all know what protein 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:28.560
 collapses 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:31.760
 so then we add protein even 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.760
 we will add cinnamon 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.770
 my favorite 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.770
 peanut butter 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:56.620
 Now we mix all this and ours 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.880
 protein shake ready it will be 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.950
 great tiffin I him 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.910
 recommend drinking in the morning since he 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.290
 contains coffee 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:08.930
 which gives energy and useful life 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.560
 which also serves us as a source 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:18.070
 energy 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:20.090
 Well start tasting and yummy 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.340
