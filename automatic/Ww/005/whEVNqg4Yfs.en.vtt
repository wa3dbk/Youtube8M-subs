00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.320 
coach's decision that I open all this up
to<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:29.070> tremendous<00:00:29.490> amount<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:29.820> speculation

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
to a tremendous amount of speculation

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.850 
to a tremendous amount of speculation
and<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.040> can<00:00:32.189> live<00:00:32.309> with<00:00:32.460> that<00:00:32.550> so<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:34.410> factor

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
and and I can live with that so a factor

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.470 
and and I can live with that so a factor
all<00:00:35.130> these<00:00:35.340> things<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:35.910> make<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.120> decision

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
all these things and I make a decision

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.750 
all these things and I make a decision
and<00:00:36.780> sometimes<00:00:37.469> it's<00:00:37.649> PI<00:00:37.770> it's<00:00:37.950> difficult<00:00:38.430> to

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
and sometimes it's PI it's difficult to

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.580 
and sometimes it's PI it's difficult to
decide<00:00:39.030> whether<00:00:39.300> it's<00:00:39.840> agreed<00:00:40.170> with<00:00:40.320> or<00:00:40.469> not

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
decide whether it's agreed with or not

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.250 
decide whether it's agreed with or not
because<00:00:40.920> you<00:00:40.950> don't<00:00:41.399> know<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.640> details<00:00:42.260> it's

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
because you don't know the details it's

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.900 
because you don't know the details it's
really<00:00:43.530> important<00:00:43.950> as<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.100> team<00:00:44.370> we<00:00:44.520> understand

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
really important as a team we understand

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.880 
really important as a team we understand
the<00:00:45.030> value<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.420> as<00:00:45.629> well<00:00:45.840> but<00:00:46.469> we<00:00:46.620> deal

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
the value of that as well but we deal

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.670 
the value of that as well but we deal
with<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.219> as<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.820> group<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.480> I've<00:00:49.200> got<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.590> make

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
with it as a group and I've got to make

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.170 
with it as a group and I've got to make
those<00:00:49.890> decisions<00:00:50.370> in<00:00:50.460> live<00:00:50.640> with<00:00:50.760> them<00:00:50.910> but

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
those decisions in live with them but

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.869 
those decisions in live with them but
those<00:00:52.140> decisions<00:00:52.469> will<00:00:52.770> remain<00:00:53.160> as<00:00:53.460> coaches

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
those decisions will remain as coaches

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.430 
those decisions will remain as coaches
decisions<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.600> won't<00:00:54.750> be<00:00:54.870> going<00:00:55.079> into<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
decisions and I won't be going into the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.340 
decisions and I won't be going into the
details<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.390> so<00:00:57.390> has<00:00:57.570> this<00:00:57.780> been<00:00:58.020> a

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
details of it so has this been a

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.410 
details of it so has this been a
distraction<00:00:58.770> at<00:00:59.129> all<00:00:59.280> for<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.910> team<00:01:00.120> inside
