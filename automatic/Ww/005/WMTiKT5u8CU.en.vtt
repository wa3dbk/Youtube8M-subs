00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.750
 hello to all youtube friends in this 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:19.730
 video I will show you the best games of 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.430
 zombies keep in mind that is my 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.140
 opinion has not been uploading videos for a long time 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.029
 because they began to bring the 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.880
 fucking exams and had to study 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.730
 ha ha ha I studied all month and disapproved 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:36.340
 most of the exams you already 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.340
 understand good let's start with the video 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.370
 land of the death with the role of jack 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.200
 a kind of farmer we will have to 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.330
 survive the attacks of the hordes 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.640
 of zombies that by the way are not very 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.489
 easy to kill but with a clean shot 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.410
 to the head it is fixed after knowing 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.570
 that the whole neighborhood has been converted into 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.309
 zombie and that you are the last human in 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.930
 foot of that area we will have to go 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.230
 to the big city to look 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.059
 survivors after discovering that no 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.400
 there are survivors in the city you 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.990
 you have to cross to the next town where 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.810
 it is said that a plan of 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.030
 containment the game is not very good 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.130
 graphically but it's very entertaining and 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.880
 has multiplayer mode that is much more 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.880
 funny yet 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.920
 I was a zombie, you will become Edward 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.610
 I was a man who died in 1933 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.320
 during the great depression and now in 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.430
 1959 has returned under the guise of a 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.290
 zombie 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.420
 this will now have a single objective 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.040
 kill anyone who passes by 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.740
 in front of the most varied forms 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.869
 eating from their brains using your 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.110
 body as a weapon using human bodies 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.270
 to attack me I really liked this 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.890
 game but if you play it very often you 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.890
 it can get boring a bit 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:25.109
 to 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.969
 of iceta mob is a game 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:32.950
 very realistic survival in which 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:34.900
 we will have to be careful not only of 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.999
 the zombies that have infested the huge 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.280
 area where we are but from 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:41.469
 everything that surrounds us we will need 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.780
 supplies to keep our 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:46.269
 character but also some source of 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.760
 light to see as soon as it gets dark and what 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.730
 most important we will need protection 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.310
 This game mode I put armed 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.560
 among the best for their realism in my 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.120
 I loved everything but I have 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.189
 to say that there are parts in which I 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.189
 I got a little bored but then it happens 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.900
 dead rising 2 the player must survive 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.050
 for 72 hours inside fortune city 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.300
 a city infected with zombies while 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.070
 runs the game the player must 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.020
 go through the various cases that are 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.880
 present to finish the game up 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.580
 that a helicopter comes to rescue 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.890
 the survivors the protagonist is not 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.810
 frank quest but a new sub character 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.610
 gn motocross star and that has 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.560
 traveled to fortuné city to 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.720
 participate in terror is reality a 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.420
 program where you must eliminate zombies 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.160
 in several different competitions he 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.739
 try to win the jackpot for 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.450
 to be able to pay for the medicine sombres which 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.830
 you need to cure your daughter who was 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.830
 bitten by a zombie 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:12.940
 Dead Island places us in vain and an island 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.930
 paradisiacal full of fun alcohol 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.450
 and beautiful women 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.090
 the protagonist after a night of 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.669
 party wakes up without almost remembering anything 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.830
 in the middle of a zombie epidemic without 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:26.290
 change a lot in history we can 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.690
 choose four characters follow me and a 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.300

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.970
 former football player knows a 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.190
 ex rapper and purna a former policeman very 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.930
 well characterized each with their 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:42.060
 own history 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.060
 This game contains very good graphics 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:16.770
 left 4 dead 2 I think that everyone 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.630
 know this play art work is 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.550
 try to travel in the first 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.800
 part through the city until you reach 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.720
 a helicopter ship tank or some of 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.420
 the vehicles that appear in the game and 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.370
 they will be rescued so as not to do so 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.200
 complicated you travel with a group of 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.740
 people and in the game can be a 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:36.210
 woman or some of the three men 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.670
 left4dead propose a lot of action in 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:41.580
 each of the missions do not get bored 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:44.100
 it never has the best graphics but 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.230
 it's not what matters to me this is the 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:50.750
 best zombie game that exists up 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.750
 now and much better in multiplayer 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.300
 It's me 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.570
 Y 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.270
 or not 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:26.210
 well that was all I hope you have 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.830
 liked the video remember that this is 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:32.390
 just my opinion and I share it with 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:34.960
 you just say chau gurugú 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:34.960
