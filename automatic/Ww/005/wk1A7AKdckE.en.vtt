00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.030
 hello and welcome to the booth 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.739
 other dominoes experiences strong I 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.710
 am in vermeil in charge of the range 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.790
 station for France and England 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.239
 and I will show you the latest 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.400
 new 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.829
 so here we have the situation of 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.080
 fears it is there it relates to 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.629
 stations the processors to the most 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.699
 evolutionary and the most influential 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:55.089
 powerful of all our guy we can 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:57.610
 put up to two cards tesla or two 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:01:00.070
 big month there is a big 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.559
 processor power the impulses 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.800
 as healthy this memory 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:09.340
 no do you really understand about a 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:11.649
 nature to meet the needs of 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.030
 3d calculating functions the 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:14.380
 the most demanding users 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.910
 and then its forms froze 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.530
 particularly interesting if the 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.560
 substation 6 3 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.229
 there we are able to offer so many 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.030
 power than in this model but on 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.430
 an extremely small format if the 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.170
 recedes third compact avenue of the market and 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.159
 today she is only three 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.240
 authors then grind the difference 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.369
 especially those located on scalability 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.200
 in terms of storage capacity 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.930
 if we can put in place a 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.479
 hard drive there are only three but 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.330
 three is already yielded the consequence is 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:49.649
 already tense let's listen to it four hours on 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:53.159
 can put the 10th sadate disks ssd 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:56.340
 or disk disk of the airlock 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:59.850
 here but here I this compact format 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.429
 the russo union have managed to put or 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.409
 such meaning in a pure so small beautiful 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:06.390
 robert's diamond that seems like his 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.000
 assassination is by nature 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.380
 then this is the assimilation is 30 pm 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.390
 our our the heart of range this 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.930
 that provides single-processor and scalable 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.150
 who has a very strong who supports up to 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.830
 to the rosewood to milou to them more one 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.290
 is expecting a beautiful fear very soon 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.810
 that they sent by bending the whole 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.600
 range the station range at the level of 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.130
 the a31 is a family we have 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:34.830
 recently completed then there the 31 c to 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.600
 a station that is aggressive in term 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.520
 of price that allows to have good 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.120
 performance but that does not give no 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.580
 the bigger the bigger one that can 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.739
 computing power combined neither 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.100
 graphical power we go up to the 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.209
 quadro 2000 or lacquered crying 2000 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.860
 eventually we are able to 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.470
 propose also by integrating a 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.250
 specific power supply a quadro card 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.780
 4000 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.209
 so we can go up a little 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.370
 little in station and so on 7 on this 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.709
 quote which is so positioning is 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.880
 really aggressive especially for 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.110
 allow users 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.459
 he was trying more to use a pc at the 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.260
 place of a workstation there it's 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.209
 really a platform that allows them 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.870
 to take the plunge because the delta of 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.640
 price is not huge so justifies 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.980
 really could have happened on a benefit 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.140
 who 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.060
 so proud we're there to celebrate so with the 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.720
 any new model that's there and who at 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:33.110
 compact format here is the last station 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.420
 that we have released this summer that he has little 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.459
 31 so the little sister of the one that 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.420
 we knew death matrouh in form 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.629
 at the cfm 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.340
 so it's cons to bonal one is 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:45.950
 request by default rod cousens picot 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.660
 face what makes that processor bambi 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.190
 had left the station is that we saw 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.290
 just now together and now 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.450
 in the part a little more entry of 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.340
 line up against him and last 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.340
 it may be that they accept 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.980
 process 0 also from memory to 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.569
 tests supports euro 2000 cards 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.209
 so he really fully certified 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:08.750
 also for the heart of the applications of the 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:11.420
 market and then against who to answer 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:14.329
 to a consumption to excesses between 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.019
 Low low consumption 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:16.970
 heat 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.160
 and then problems of the office 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.870
 in that it is included thirteen times is 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.330
 has little room to be complete a 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.800
 station is working so we drove to 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.510
 your tickets from very low to very 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.470
 small footprint 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.300
 it's empty and one last in 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.720
 launches do on the war six 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.350
 Nations 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:40.220
 the fruits on the thinkpad party you 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:42.020
 have here the simba w530 which is the 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.050
 latest version of the possession of 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:48.950
 15 inch ball that already exist 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.870
 especially on the thinkpad range is so 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.870
 the last generation to the team and the 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.900
 crying nvidia cards to choose from at 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.030
 carnoux which of Lille always 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:03.260
 intel processors that takes you out etc this 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:04.529
 excerpt 32 32 gigabytes of memory actually 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.899
 not if you're too 

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:09.029
 and hard drives with built-in raid 

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:09.629
 as standard out of six spat our 

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:13.769
 portable 

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:16.529
 and then in the specificities some 

00:05:13.769 --> 00:05:18.059
 users who need a rendering to 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:20.369
 the screen that is really faithful to the tale 

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:21.989
 said finished one integrates into calibrator of 

00:05:20.369 --> 00:05:25.499
 color that allows you to make a setting 

00:05:21.989 --> 00:05:30.899
 automatic screen to win this 

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:33.679
 last one exactly here thank you for this turn 

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:33.679
 horizon a treat 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.600
 we 

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:59.670
 bayou 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:59.670
 Oh
