00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:16.449
 You make a handle so much if you go. 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:19.419
 leave only at the top or part of the 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:22.840
 below is your personal choice 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:26.560
 I'll leave the handle on the bottom 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:29.980
 the sheath you can do both in the cable 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.619
 How much in the sheath I prefer to do in 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.910
 I do not like to handle the cable with 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.949
 a rolled rope 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:41.100
 What is your personal preference then? 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:41.100
 I made the handle that here is just starting to roll 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.090
 has no secret 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.260
 If you do not know how to make a strong name, it's 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.089
 interesting that you look in my 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.710
 channel on the site tocandira how do you 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:07.720
 makes it a very useful asset 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.450
 the northern principle was used by 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.690
 example to make the mark parallel or 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.210
 circular tie and here I am using 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.320
 to put a piece of cutting in 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.979
 sheath or knife handle 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.979
 leaving very firm 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:38.670
 I finished it does not give to another 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.670
 round then I'll spend the 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.800
 accord that was left inside the handle and 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.450
 I will pull this one I left 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.590
 prepared on the other side to give a 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:54.760
 Finishing pulls a lot here for 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:57.610
 get to put the surplus one turn 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:02.220
 Here's the iron, the resemblance just does not 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.220
 bothering this piece of cable 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.380
 if you found this video interesting
