00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
line ran into it so how it works is once

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.770 
line ran into it so how it works is once
you<00:01:00.059> place<00:01:00.360> it<00:01:00.540> down<00:01:00.690> okay<00:01:02.330> once<00:01:03.330> you<00:01:03.420> place<00:01:03.629> it

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:54.350 
part is if i walk over it it doesn't set
it<00:01:51.810> off<00:01:51.930> so<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.200> could<00:01:52.259> jump<00:01:52.680> on<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:53.119> nothing<00:01:54.119> it

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
it off so I could jump on it nothing it

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.620 
it off so I could jump on it nothing it
only<00:01:54.960> is<00:01:55.200> triggered<00:01:55.649> by<00:01:55.680> mobs<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:56.700> also<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.479> can

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
only is triggered by mobs so also I can

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.230 
only is triggered by mobs so also I can
break<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:58.430> pick<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.579> up<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.850> put<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.119> somewhere

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
break it pick it up and put it somewhere

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.800 
break it pick it up and put it somewhere
else<00:02:00.689> so<00:02:00.990> that's<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.380> very<00:02:01.799> very<00:02:02.159> cool<00:02:02.399> part

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
to show you guys how to craft one of

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.620 
to show you guys how to craft one of
these<00:02:11.360> so<00:02:12.360> what<00:02:12.600> you<00:02:12.720> need<00:02:12.900> is<00:02:13.140> oh<00:02:14.420> boy<00:02:15.420> I<00:02:15.450> don't

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
are wondering this is a temporary map

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.310 
are wondering this is a temporary map
that<00:02:23.040> I<00:02:23.070> use<00:02:23.520> for<00:02:23.550> my<00:02:23.790> single<00:02:24.240> player<00:02:24.480> what<00:02:25.290> I

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
that I use for my single player what I

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.940 
that I use for my single player what I
just<00:02:25.560> want<00:02:25.710> to<00:02:25.770> have<00:02:25.890> fun<00:02:25.920> in<00:02:26.580> test<00:02:26.880> out<00:02:27.120> mods

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
just want to have fun in test out mods

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.350 
just want to have fun in test out mods
so<00:02:28.950> first<00:02:29.430> what<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:29.760> want<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.030> do<00:02:30.150> is<00:02:30.270> you<00:02:30.300> want

so after you get your whoops gosh so

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.179 
so after you get your whoops gosh so
once<00:02:39.930> you<00:02:40.019> get<00:02:40.170> your<00:02:40.290> team<00:02:40.500> t<00:02:40.709> you<00:02:40.860> just<00:02:40.890> place

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:41.189 
once you get your team t you just place

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:44.470 
once you get your team t you just place
the<00:02:41.340> TT<00:02:41.700> in<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.849> bottom<00:02:42.209> and<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:43.379> place<00:02:43.680> one

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
the TT in the bottom and you place one

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.600 
the TT in the bottom and you place one
redstone<00:02:45.480> or<00:02:45.900> two<00:02:46.110> red<00:02:46.290> stones<00:02:46.560> right<00:02:47.370> above

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
redstone or two red stones right above

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.699 
redstone or two red stones right above
that<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:47.970> then<00:02:48.329> to<00:02:48.599> iron<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.200> side<00:02:49.409> of<00:02:49.439> it

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
that and then to iron to the side of it

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.270 
that and then to iron to the side of it
and<00:02:49.829> boom<00:02:50.370> you<00:02:50.519> get<00:02:50.670> eight<00:02:50.909> bouncing<00:02:51.299> Betties

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
and boom you get eight bouncing Betties

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.949 
and boom you get eight bouncing Betties
so<00:02:53.280> since<00:02:53.489> I<00:02:53.579> have<00:02:53.609> two<00:02:53.879> more<00:02:54.090> T&amp;T<00:02:54.299> I'm<00:02:54.780> just

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
so since I have two more T&amp;T I'm just

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.960 
so since I have two more T&amp;T I'm just
going<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:55.170> give<00:02:56.040> myself<00:02:56.220> some<00:02:56.549> more<00:02:56.700> of<00:02:56.909> these

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
going to give myself some more of these

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:03.289 
going to give myself some more of these
bouncing<00:02:57.480> Betties<00:02:57.780> and<00:03:01.159> yeah<00:03:02.159> now<00:03:02.549> I've<00:03:02.790> got<00:03:03.060> a

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
bouncing Betties and yeah now I've got a

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.360 
bouncing Betties and yeah now I've got a
good<00:03:03.780> amount<00:03:04.079> of<00:03:04.260> bouncing<00:03:04.650> Betties<00:03:04.950> however

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
good amount of bouncing Betties however

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.550 
good amount of bouncing Betties however
it<00:03:05.640> is<00:03:05.790> very<00:03:05.909> costly<00:03:06.540> just<00:03:06.840> cost<00:03:07.109> a<00:03:07.290> lot<00:03:07.409> of

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
it is very costly just cost a lot of

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.069 
it is very costly just cost a lot of
redstone<00:03:07.909> does<00:03:08.909> cost<00:03:09.180> a<00:03:09.299> lot<00:03:09.359> of<00:03:09.510> iron<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:09.930> it

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
redstone does cost a lot of iron and it

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:11.899 
redstone does cost a lot of iron and it
does<00:03:10.260> cost<00:03:10.560> a<00:03:10.709> lot<00:03:10.829> of<00:03:10.950> gunpowder<00:03:11.340> so<00:03:11.760> if

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
does cost a lot of gunpowder so if

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.470 
does cost a lot of gunpowder so if
you're<00:03:12.060> running<00:03:12.150> sdks<00:03:12.780> gun<00:03:13.019> mod<00:03:13.230> like<00:03:13.440> I<00:03:13.590> am

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
you're running sdks gun mod like I am

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.270 
you're running sdks gun mod like I am
you're<00:03:15.480> going<00:03:15.599> to<00:03:15.659> be<00:03:15.720> going<00:03:15.840> through<00:03:15.959> that

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
you're going to be going through that

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.979 
you're going to be going through that
gunpowder<00:03:17.280> real<00:03:17.819> real<00:03:18.090> fast<00:03:18.299> if<00:03:18.629> you<00:03:18.750> want<00:03:18.930> to

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
gunpowder real real fast if you want to

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.089 
gunpowder real real fast if you want to
use<00:03:19.109> these<00:03:19.260> bouncing<00:03:19.650> Betties<00:03:20.329> so<00:03:21.950> what<00:03:22.950> do<00:03:23.040> I

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
use these bouncing Betties so what do I

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.250 
use these bouncing Betties so what do I
reckon<00:03:23.489> well<00:03:23.700> how<00:03:24.450> would<00:03:24.510> I<00:03:24.659> rate<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.049> mod<00:03:25.230> I

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
reckon well how would I rate the mod I

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.869 
reckon well how would I rate the mod I
think<00:03:25.620> it's<00:03:25.739> an<00:03:25.859> excellent<00:03:26.040> model<00:03:26.549> the<00:03:26.730> only

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 
think it's an excellent model the only

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:29.690 
think it's an excellent model the only
problem<00:03:27.299> is<00:03:27.500> you<00:03:28.500> know<00:03:28.620> it<00:03:28.799> does<00:03:28.980> cost<00:03:29.370> a<00:03:29.579> lot

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
problem is you know it does cost a lot

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.179 
problem is you know it does cost a lot
to<00:03:29.760> make<00:03:30.120> it<00:03:30.329> but<00:03:30.599> hey<00:03:30.780> it's<00:03:31.500> a<00:03:31.650> very<00:03:31.859> clever

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:32.189 
to make it but hey it's a very clever

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:36.559 
to make it but hey it's a very clever
idea<00:03:32.730> so<00:03:33.590> yeah<00:03:34.590> overall<00:03:35.099> I'd<00:03:35.519> recommend<00:03:36.329> them

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
idea so yeah overall I'd recommend them

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.860 
idea so yeah overall I'd recommend them
on<00:03:36.689> so<00:03:36.959> I<00:03:37.019> hope<00:03:37.139> you<00:03:37.260> guys<00:03:37.290> can<00:03:38.690> go<00:03:39.690> ahead<00:03:39.720> and
