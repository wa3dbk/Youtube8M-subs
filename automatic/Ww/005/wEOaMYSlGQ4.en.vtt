00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.930

 I see this from here, it's up to me cosmetics. 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.250
 I've seen this someone talking about this. 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.950
 brand 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.920

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:04.980
 so this here is a chiller power 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:09.480
 72 power to the chorus 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:13.829
 Just what beautiful music does it look like? 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:17.130
 segment the name you left here and I'm going 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:20.639
 to enjoy it begins to blur the 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.230
 People are very happy, they'll focus right now. 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:24.829
 What time did I get there? 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:30.989
 I do not know if you'll see the 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:33.420
 This is the cut of this pigment I found good. 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:37.319
 because they already start a good size, right? 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.799
 the pigment a and then the next product is 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:43.709
 this from here 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:47.040
 sexy sexy hair 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:49.950
 the aga noia O what is this here 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.150
 exactly is one is a hair cream 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.190
 if I'm not mistaken 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.920
 You know I've always seen this brand but I 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.410
 I never stopped to see if it's to buy 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.650
 nothing to test to see if it suits 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.459
 I'm going to enjoy it so I'm going to test it now 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.880
 this from here 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:08.519
 leaves only see straight what is not 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:14.430
 I'm wrong, it's a treatment cream. 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:16.560
 even to make the hair style is okay 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.620
 Do you think I'm wrong and who is it? 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.359
 for something else you can correct 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:25.200
 then the time we opened the door 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:26.639
 instead of those to that shell ball the people 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.219
 breathe several things 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:35.370
 of this brand is one of them I even have 

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:38.069
 here where the show is, I think it's the fast 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.439
 I think this one is a business look 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:42.090
 she even has here remembers that enjoyment and even 

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:44.189
 I use it from time to time I said that 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.020
 It was a bomb this week I said 

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:48.210
 something about it 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:53.520
 in some of these fights it's already gone 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:56.249
 here is the print but I said that 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.900
 Come on, I'm out of my mouth, I do not remember 

00:04:56.249 --> 00:05:03.719
 So much bullshit is coming back here. 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:05.599
 Well, good bia shell suite xix 

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:11.129
 It must be a blush. 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:12.900
 Let's open thinking it 's full size. 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:17.120
 Finding size is good, huh? 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:21.419
 the packaging looks like the mac here color 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:23.729
 blush blush 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:25.710
 the color of the packaging is identical to that of 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:26.819
 I'll tell you guys if you want just to have 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.360
 a notion 

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:33.930
 I think it's cool, this color I'm going to test 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:36.870
 Certainly because I lack blush right? 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.740
 agett as you know I almost do not have 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.310
 none 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:44.120
 anyway the next product that we see 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:51.270
 This is the last one in here. 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:54.529
 it is a glaze session nor there what is 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:06:00.589
 Xuxa, this is what you say 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:06:05.189
 Let's see the color of the enamel in these colors 

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:07.020
 I do not like that rose, but we 

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:09.060
 You need to see if it is good consistency 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.539
 although I do not like this color much 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:16.199
 Okay, but I think it 's a size 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:19.860
 full-size looks 15 ml is an enamel on 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:22.169
 functional size and even I just do not 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:26.659
 I like the color but I believe the 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:28.860
 product should be good I'll try it 

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:31.830
 good enamel so these were the four 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:34.229
 products that came this time and there 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.659
 possible the tummy comes written like this 

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:39.920
 Where are you? 

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:43.100
 okay so these were the products 

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:46.070
 This month is very well. I liked this. 

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:48.320
 Last month I was in doubt, yes but 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:50.540
 This month I liked it and I think it will overcome 

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:53.120
 Worth the pigment though I 

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:55.850
 believe not only that this is not the 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.890
 Full size size do we need more 

00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:01.160
 that this in my people who is a 

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:03.580
 pigment to last 50 years until the 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:07.970
 blush full size here is one 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:11.810
 sample size is good up to 25 ml have I 

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:14.630
 I'll test to see and the enamel left 

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:18.740
 open here for you to see the color again 

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:22.160
 This rose I thought was worth it. 

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:25.400
 although I do not like this cut but 

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:27.980
 I liked it so overall what came 

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:30.170
