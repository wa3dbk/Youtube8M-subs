00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.699
 the echo that is around the corner knows me 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.610
 my name is smooth and today they 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.800
 I bring a smoothie or it is very or like 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.350
 They want to say that it is really very 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.320
 rich this can easily convert 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.449
 in an ice cream something to pass it ganitas 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.000
 if they want something sweet, it's not so sweet 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:48.159
 and the other because I put very little 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.290
 oreo cookies between tomÃ¡s you put 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:52.870
 sure richer until nothing I hope that 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.030
 they like it very much it is very simple 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.640
 it's super easy to do I do not forgive you 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.190
 if you do not because it's very rich 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.989
 right so let's go to it 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:06.380
 for this activity we're just going to 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:08.780
 need cookies orio milk and ice cream 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.630
 well let's start by shredding the 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.700
 cookies with or without cream with cream 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.070
 but a little sweeter like 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.470
 is very rich in the crushing is so much 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.840
 because we are going to put them in the same 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.610
 blender and I got caught eating 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:28.180
 little cream for him that was very rich 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.480
 we are going to add everything to the blender the 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:34.390
 measures depend a lot on you I throw 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:37.180
 a cup of milk a packet of cookies 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.070
 oreo and an ice cream ball is supposed 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.620
 that was just for me but they came out 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.200
 two glasses equal and you can take 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:49.080
 less milk more ice cream and many more 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.080
 cookies you have much much richer 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.520
 Now you 're going to liquefy everything, do not delay 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.760
 nothing and also something that you advice 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.410
 when you already have it to serve in the glass 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.680
 letters plus oreo cookie bits and 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:06.080
 leave them down there because he also knows 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.630
 very rich also what I love is 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.870
 this little thing that remains in the part of 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.270
 top of the blender there these weights 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.380
 as the richest I really swear 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:22.340
 they are delicious I am no longer, I mean, I know 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.020
 I was putting water in the mouth of nothing 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.760
 more see this video I hope that to you 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.800
 also and good what I did and the 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.690
 final as to decorate was 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.540
 mainly and put a few steps 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:37.570
 of cookies but not really that is 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.570
 very rich I recommend it very much 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.239
 Now if you want it like ice cream and nothing 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.420
 plus 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:02.349
 you put me believe that these corridors here 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:06.040
 cupcakes are in the plastic 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:08.709
 I put there also these little pieces of 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.500
 serve tequila tequila, if not 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:14.680
 I'm bad that's what they call a mass this 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.890
 you put them two chopsticks or a stick 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.690
 big and that's it 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.180
 in case you do not have say containers 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.990
 to place ice cream and also already very 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.290
 rich 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:31.020
 I also think that since he has two 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.110
 little ones look like all tender two 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.240
 pretty 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.950

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.680
 true because they liked it very much 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.930
 I really like this 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.270
 when you do not make recipe videos 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.740
 Repeat a lot until super rich I loved it 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.260
 I do not know what but it is true 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.960
 I observe I would teach them something that I do not 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.630
 like then, here is this 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.400

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.790
