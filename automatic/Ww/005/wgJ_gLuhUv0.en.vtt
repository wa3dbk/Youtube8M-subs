hi<00:00:00.390> I'm<00:00:00.599> Dave<00:00:00.870> back<00:00:01.199> with<00:00:01.410> another<00:00:01.650> Summit

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
hi I'm Dave back with another Summit

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.370 
hi I'm Dave back with another Summit
Racing<00:00:02.280> 101<00:00:03.000> where<00:00:03.240> we<00:00:03.360> teach<00:00:03.600> you<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:03.810> basics

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
Racing 101 where we teach you the basics

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:13.039 
Racing 101 where we teach you the basics
of<00:00:04.500> automotive<00:00:04.980> tech<00:00:11.360> okay<00:00:12.360> so<00:00:12.540> one<00:00:12.900> of<00:00:12.929> the

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
of automotive tech okay so one of the

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.770 
of automotive tech okay so one of the
more<00:00:13.170> basic<00:00:13.380> questions<00:00:14.190> we<00:00:14.580> hear<00:00:14.940> quite<00:00:15.509> often

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
more basic questions we hear quite often

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.930 
more basic questions we hear quite often
and<00:00:16.410> see<00:00:16.619> on<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.830> Internet<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.369> what<00:00:17.400> is<00:00:17.820> the

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
and see on the Internet is what is the

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.609 
and see on the Internet is what is the
difference<00:00:18.359> between<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.810> catback<00:00:19.590> exhaust

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
difference between a catback exhaust

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.099 
difference between a catback exhaust
system<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.640> an<00:00:21.029> axle-back<00:00:21.420> exhaust<00:00:21.600> system

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
system and an axle-back exhaust system

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.269 
system and an axle-back exhaust system
so<00:00:22.470> we're<00:00:22.560> going<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.740> talk<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.920> little<00:00:23.130> bit<00:00:23.250> more

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
so we're going to talk a little bit more

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.279 
so we're going to talk a little bit more
about<00:00:23.670> that<00:00:23.730> today<00:00:24.150> starting<00:00:25.080> with<00:00:25.109> the

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
about that today starting with the

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.950 
about that today starting with the
physical<00:00:25.769> characteristics<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.670> each<00:00:26.960> we'll

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
physical characteristics of each we'll

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.439 
physical characteristics of each we'll
start<00:00:28.260> here<00:00:28.439> with<00:00:28.500> our<00:00:28.789> catback<00:00:29.789> system<00:00:30.269> as

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
start here with our catback system as

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.110 
start here with our catback system as
the<00:00:31.140> name<00:00:31.289> implies<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:32.070> replaces<00:00:32.940> everything

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
the name implies it replaces everything

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.330 
the name implies it replaces everything
on<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.630> stock<00:00:33.930> exhaust<00:00:34.230> system<00:00:34.649> from<00:00:35.219> the

axle-back systems on the other hand are

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.959 
axle-back systems on the other hand are
just<00:00:46.289> everything<00:00:46.800> from<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.070> rear<00:00:47.250> axle<00:00:47.700> back

exhaust tip all the hardware needed to
make<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.199> connection<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:56.239> why<00:00:57.239> would

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
make that connection so why would

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.459 
make that connection so why would
somebody<00:00:57.719> choose<00:00:57.899> one<00:00:58.680> over<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.160> other<00:00:59.420> well

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
somebody choose one over the other well

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.020 
somebody choose one over the other well
looking<00:01:01.469> at<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.770> catback<00:01:02.190> system<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.850> is

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
looking at the catback system that is

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.820 
looking at the catback system that is
one<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.510> more<00:01:03.660> popular<00:01:03.899> upgrades<00:01:04.500> people

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
one of the more popular upgrades people

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.410 
one of the more popular upgrades people
make<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.100> their<00:01:05.220> vehicle<00:01:05.640> often<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.270> first

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
make to their vehicle often the first

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.660 
make to their vehicle often the first
upgrade<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.409> reason<00:01:07.740> being<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.250> the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
upgrade and the reason being is the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.490 
upgrade and the reason being is the
catback<00:01:09.150> does<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.479> really<00:01:10.020> good<00:01:10.140> job<00:01:10.320> at

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
catback does a really good job at

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.190 
catback does a really good job at
reducing<00:01:10.979> exhaust<00:01:11.490> restriction<00:01:12.420> over<00:01:12.900> the

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
reducing exhaust restriction over the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.520 
reducing exhaust restriction over the
stock<00:01:13.500> exhaust<00:01:13.890> system<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.520> that's<00:01:15.090> because

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
stock exhaust system and that's because

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.960 
stock exhaust system and that's because
again<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.950> catback<00:01:17.340> includes<00:01:17.850> an

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
again the catback includes an

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.999 
again the catback includes an
intermediate<00:01:18.570> pipe<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.799> intermediate

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
intermediate pipe and the intermediate

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.609 
intermediate pipe and the intermediate
pipe<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.790> aftermarket<00:01:21.330> catback<00:01:22.140> systems

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
pipe on the aftermarket catback systems

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.070 
pipe on the aftermarket catback systems
will<00:01:23.250> use<00:01:23.430> mandrel<00:01:23.939> bends<00:01:24.299> as<00:01:24.420> opposed<00:01:24.990> to

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
will use mandrel bends as opposed to

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.810 
will use mandrel bends as opposed to
crush<00:01:25.350> pins<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:25.979> get<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.159> better<00:01:26.369> exhaust

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
crush pins so you get a better exhaust

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.810 
crush pins so you get a better exhaust
flow<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.299> there<00:01:27.860> through<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.040> intermediate

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
flow in there through the intermediate

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.640 
flow in there through the intermediate
pipe<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.390> also<00:01:32.390> often<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.750> catback<00:01:34.200> systems

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
pipe and also often the catback systems

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.560 
pipe and also often the catback systems
are<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.829> larger<00:01:35.159> diameter<00:01:35.310> or<00:01:35.790> wider<00:01:35.970> pipe<00:01:36.270> than

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
are a larger diameter or wider pipe than

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.450 
are a larger diameter or wider pipe than
the<00:01:36.659> stock<00:01:36.930> system<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.650> get<00:01:37.770> better<00:01:38.009> flow

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
the stock system so you get better flow

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.620 
the stock system so you get better flow
less<00:01:39.090> exhaust<00:01:39.560> restriction<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.770> therefore

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
less exhaust restriction and therefore

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.230 
less exhaust restriction and therefore
horsepower<00:01:42.630> gains<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:43.320> way<00:01:43.530> also<00:01:44.399> because

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
horsepower gains that way also because

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.270 
horsepower gains that way also because
the<00:01:45.720> exhaust<00:01:45.990> flow<00:01:46.320> going<00:01:46.530> through<00:01:46.860> there<00:01:47.100> and

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
the exhaust flow going through there and

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.550 
the exhaust flow going through there and
because<00:01:48.060> you're<00:01:48.210> replacing<00:01:48.780> more<00:01:48.960> components

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
because you're replacing more components

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.899 
because you're replacing more components
on<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.740> exhaust<00:01:50.040> system<00:01:50.189> you'll<00:01:50.520> get<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.670> more

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
on the exhaust system you'll get a more

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.819 
on the exhaust system you'll get a more
aggressive<00:01:51.180> performance<00:01:51.840> sound<00:01:52.439> from<00:01:52.770> a

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
aggressive performance sound from a

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.760 
aggressive performance sound from a
catback<00:01:53.280> system<00:01:53.759> so<00:01:54.689> having<00:01:54.930> said<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.259> why

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
catback system so having said that why

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.280 
catback system so having said that why
then<00:01:56.009> go<00:01:56.250> with<00:01:56.460> an<00:01:56.579> axle-back<00:01:57.000> system<00:01:57.390> there's

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
then go with an axle-back system there's

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.520 
then go with an axle-back system there's
a<00:01:58.350> few<00:01:58.680> advantages<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.490> an<00:01:59.579> axle-back<00:01:59.969> system

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
a few advantages to an axle-back system

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.920 
a few advantages to an axle-back system
if<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.770> have<00:02:02.040> an<00:02:02.969> exhaust<00:02:03.390> system<00:02:03.479> that

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
if you have an exhaust system that

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.139 
if you have an exhaust system that
already<00:02:04.200> flows<00:02:04.560> well<00:02:04.829> has<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.070> wide<00:02:05.549> exhaust

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
already flows well has a wide exhaust

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.139 
already flows well has a wide exhaust
pipe<00:02:06.450> wide<00:02:06.719> diameter<00:02:07.310> this<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:08.520> probably<00:02:09.030> a

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
pipe wide diameter this is probably a

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.040 
pipe wide diameter this is probably a
good<00:02:09.390> way<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.629> go<00:02:09.869> because<00:02:09.899> you're<00:02:10.619> replacing

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
good way to go because you're replacing

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.140 
good way to go because you're replacing
the<00:02:12.230> backend<00:02:12.680> components<00:02:13.340> again<00:02:13.550> from<00:02:14.030> the

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
the backend components again from the

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.870 
the backend components again from the
axle<00:02:14.630> back<00:02:15.020> to<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.320> rear<00:02:15.560> bumper<00:02:15.710> so<00:02:16.190> you<00:02:16.700> can

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
axle back to the rear bumper so you can

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.020 
axle back to the rear bumper so you can
swap<00:02:17.180> out<00:02:17.420> that<00:02:17.750> your<00:02:18.400> exhaust<00:02:19.400> tip<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:19.940> your

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
swap out that your exhaust tip and your

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.190 
swap out that your exhaust tip and your
muffler<00:02:20.300> with<00:02:20.510> something<00:02:21.050> more

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
muffler with something more

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.840 
muffler with something more
aesthetically<00:02:21.770> pleasing<00:02:21.800> it's<00:02:22.460> an<00:02:22.550> easy<00:02:22.670> way

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
aesthetically pleasing it's an easy way

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.390 
aesthetically pleasing it's an easy way
to<00:02:22.880> do<00:02:23.120> that<00:02:23.360> there's<00:02:23.990> less<00:02:24.200> components<00:02:24.980> to

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
to do that there's less components to

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.040 
to do that there's less components to
install<00:02:25.820> so<00:02:26.060> it's<00:02:26.180> a<00:02:26.240> little<00:02:26.390> bit<00:02:26.570> easier<00:02:26.930> to

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
install so it's a little bit easier to

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.800 
install so it's a little bit easier to
install<00:02:27.320> and<00:02:27.710> because<00:02:28.460> that's<00:02:28.760> also<00:02:29.030> maybe<00:02:29.660> an
