 of integral education 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.329

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.000
 complementing the official curriculum 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:53.630
 electives that are elaborate disciplines 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.420
 by teachers based on 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.580
 in a life project of the students 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.890
 preparing for the

 si sic is the guide of the whole program 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.649
 and we also have the youth clubs 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.720
 the project helped me to it 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.160
 find out who I am what I want 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.110
 for my future 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.140
 the index of development of education 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.209
 the state of são paulo and desp 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.880
 It is an indicator of quality of education 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.280
 elementary and high school levels that vary 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.769
 on a scale of 0 to 10 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:37.549
 idesp at school alexandre a goal 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:42.200
 increased from 1.94 in 2011 to 3.41 in 2012 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:43.730
 an advance of about 80% in the school they 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.590
 prioritize enough that we want the 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.870
 our future and I did not think about it 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.790
 When I entered everything changed I had to 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.760
 to get accustomed but I have gained much more 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:58.000
 because I started to study more and above 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.000
 of all I started to think of myself 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.260
 that in brazil today the integral education 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:10.310
 it's still a pilot project but I think 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.870
 what as a country 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.310
 We did not understand that this is a 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.569
 important policy for us to give a 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.970
 quality jump 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.540
 If we think Brazil will vote 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.540
 is 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.189
 is a spending of 10% of GDP for education 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.590
 devoted an important part of 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:28.290
 oil royalties education has not 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.810
 because we do not advance to rethink the 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.849
 model of integral education the model of 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.420
 education in developed countries to 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:35.420
 all Brazilians
