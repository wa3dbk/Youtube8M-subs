think people just was got down a little

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.700 
think people just was got down a little
bit<00:03:32.510> after<00:03:32.600> we<00:03:32.720> lost<00:03:32.930> our<00:03:33.050> first<00:03:33.200> game<00:03:33.470> and

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:33.710 
bit after we lost our first game and

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.430 
bit after we lost our first game and
people<00:03:34.520> kind<00:03:34.580> of<00:03:34.670> lost<00:03:34.820> focus<00:03:35.090> and<00:03:35.440> they

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
people kind of lost focus and they

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.600 
people kind of lost focus and they
started<00:03:36.800> thinking<00:03:36.890> too<00:03:37.100> much<00:03:37.130> instead<00:03:37.520> of

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
started thinking too much instead of

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:38.680 
started thinking too much instead of
playing<00:03:37.790> the<00:03:37.940> ball<00:03:38.090> that<00:03:38.180> we<00:03:38.270> was<00:03:38.390> playing<00:03:38.600> in

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
the beginning the last two games I think

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.430 
the beginning the last two games I think
we<00:03:40.940> got<00:03:41.090> back<00:03:41.270> to<00:03:41.390> playing<00:03:41.570> at<00:03:41.810> normal<00:03:41.960> Kansas
