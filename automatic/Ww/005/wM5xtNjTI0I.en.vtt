00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:03.800 
hey guys this is esco from MPT craft

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.670 
hey guys this is esco from MPT craft
here<00:00:03.980> and<00:00:04.160> this<00:00:04.609> is<00:00:04.910> a<00:00:05.120> stupid<00:00:06.020> chicken

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:06.680 
here and this is a stupid chicken

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.370 
here and this is a stupid chicken
because<00:00:06.980> it's<00:00:07.220> ruining<00:00:07.549> my<00:00:07.670> intro<00:00:08.029> and<00:00:09.019> this

because it's ruining my intro and this

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.900 
because it's ruining my intro and this
is<00:00:09.950> the<00:00:10.220> gravity<00:00:10.639> gun<00:00:12.160> this<00:00:13.160> is<00:00:13.280> really<00:00:13.519> fun<00:00:13.880> to

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910 
is the gravity gun this is really fun to

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.790 
is the gravity gun this is really fun to
do<00:00:14.150> and<00:00:14.559> I<00:00:15.559> would<00:00:16.369> love<00:00:16.640> to<00:00:17.390> see<00:00:17.600> that<00:00:17.630> on<00:00:18.140> a<00:00:18.199> pvp

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
do and I would love to see that on a pvp

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.939 
do and I would love to see that on a pvp
server<00:00:19.310> and<00:00:20.410> yeah<00:00:21.410> I<00:00:21.440> can<00:00:21.650> she<00:00:21.770> showed

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:21.949 
server and yeah I can she showed

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.720 
server and yeah I can she showed
multiple<00:00:22.310> errors<00:00:22.730> and<00:00:24.130> this<00:00:25.130> is<00:00:25.250> really<00:00:25.460> cool

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
multiple errors and this is really cool

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.570 
multiple errors and this is really cool
and<00:00:26.350> today<00:00:27.350> I<00:00:27.529> will<00:00:27.769> show<00:00:27.800> to<00:00:27.980> you<00:00:28.100> how<00:00:28.340> this

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
and today I will show to you how this

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.709 
and today I will show to you how this
works<00:00:29.410> so<00:00:30.410> basically<00:00:31.220> how<00:00:31.460> this<00:00:31.640> works<00:00:31.849> is<00:00:32.090> a

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
works so basically how this works is a

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:36.009 
works so basically how this works is a
super<00:00:33.050> fast<00:00:33.229> clock<00:00:33.589> and<00:00:33.800> a<00:00:34.370> slow<00:00:34.550> clock<00:00:34.819> and<00:00:35.059> I

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:36.019 
super fast clock and a slow clock and I

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:38.529 
super fast clock and a slow clock and I
got<00:00:36.319> used<00:00:36.530> to<00:00:36.739> using<00:00:37.039> those<00:00:37.339> this<00:00:38.239> is<00:00:38.420> the

00:00:38.529 --> 00:00:38.539 
got used to using those this is the

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:40.299 
got used to using those this is the
super<00:00:38.809> fast<00:00:38.839> clock<00:00:39.289> which<00:00:39.530> is<00:00:39.739> a<00:00:39.769> set<00:00:40.039> block

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
super fast clock which is a set block

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.239 
super fast clock which is a set block
clock<00:00:40.670> and<00:00:40.989> over<00:00:41.989> there<00:00:42.199> is<00:00:42.379> a<00:00:42.679> slow<00:00:42.949> clock

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:43.249 
clock and over there is a slow clock

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:47.770 
clock and over there is a slow clock
which<00:00:43.519> is<00:00:43.639> a<00:00:43.670> hopper<00:00:43.999> clock<00:00:44.389> and<00:00:46.659> this<00:00:47.659> is

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
which is a hopper clock and this is

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.360 
which is a hopper clock and this is
faster<00:00:48.199> than<00:00:48.319> a<00:00:48.350> normal<00:00:48.499> hop<00:00:48.799> o'clock<00:00:49.129> because

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
faster than a normal hop o'clock because

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.250 
faster than a normal hop o'clock because
it<00:00:49.729> has<00:00:49.819> its<00:00:49.999> transfer<00:00:50.389> cool<00:00:50.600> and<00:00:50.780> set<00:00:50.959> to<00:00:51.079> one

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
it has its transfer cool and set to one

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.599 
it has its transfer cool and set to one
and<00:00:51.969> let's<00:00:52.969> begin<00:00:53.179> with<00:00:53.359> the<00:00:54.069> objectives<00:00:55.069> so

00:00:55.599 --> 00:00:55.609 
and let's begin with the objectives so

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:57.279 
and let's begin with the objectives so
there<00:00:55.909> are<00:00:55.940> three<00:00:56.209> objectives<00:00:56.539> the<00:00:56.899> first<00:00:57.109> one

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
there are three objectives the first one

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:58.809 
there are three objectives the first one
called<00:00:57.469> arrow<00:00:57.709> TP<00:00:58.039> the<00:00:58.190> second<00:00:58.489> one<00:00:58.609> called

00:00:58.809 --> 00:00:58.819 
called arrow TP the second one called

00:00:58.819 --> 00:01:00.549 
called arrow TP the second one called
arrow<00:00:59.029> time<00:00:59.299> and<00:00:59.510> the<00:00:59.929> third<00:01:00.109> one<00:01:00.350> called

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
arrow time and the third one called

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:06.190 
arrow time and the third one called
explode<00:01:03.010> so<00:01:04.010> on<00:01:04.489> a<00:01:04.640> super-fast<00:01:05.119> clock<00:01:05.449> there

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
explode so on a super-fast clock there

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.069 
explode so on a super-fast clock there
are<00:01:06.640> these<00:01:07.640> command<00:01:07.969> blocks<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:08.539> first<00:01:08.810> one

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:09.079 
are these command blocks the first one

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:12.459 
are these command blocks the first one
and<00:01:09.259> we'll<00:01:09.859> add<00:01:10.130> a<00:01:10.159> lifetime<00:01:10.880> ER<00:01:11.140> this<00:01:12.140> one<00:01:12.350> is

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:12.469 
and we'll add a lifetime ER this one is

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:15.459 
and we'll add a lifetime ER this one is
called<00:01:12.500> a<00:01:12.829> OTP<00:01:13.689> it's<00:01:14.689> an<00:01:14.930> arrow<00:01:15.170> to<00:01:15.259> be

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:15.469 
called a OTP it's an arrow to be

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:17.289 
called a OTP it's an arrow to be
objective<00:01:15.649> and<00:01:16.100> if<00:01:16.310> there<00:01:16.549> is<00:01:16.729> a<00:01:16.759> narrow<00:01:17.030> and

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
objective and if there is a narrow and

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.679 
objective and if there is a narrow and
which<00:01:17.960> is<00:01:18.200> in<00:01:18.320> the<00:01:18.409> ground<00:01:18.590> and<00:01:18.890> only<00:01:19.280> pick<00:01:20.030> and

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
which is in the ground and only pick and

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:22.840 
which is in the ground and only pick and
pick<00:01:20.990> up<00:01:21.200> Abel<00:01:21.350> by<00:01:21.649> people<00:01:22.189> in<00:01:22.250> survival<00:01:22.729> and

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
pick up Abel by people in survival and

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.840 
pick up Abel by people in survival and
creative<00:01:23.240> and<00:01:23.420> it<00:01:24.020> will<00:01:24.229> add<00:01:24.439> one<00:01:24.829> to<00:01:25.189> its

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
creative and it will add one to its

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.240 
creative and it will add one to its
arrow<00:01:26.509> key<00:01:26.810> p<00:01:26.960> value<00:01:27.350> and<00:01:27.560> therefore<00:01:27.740> this<00:01:28.100> is

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
arrow key p value and therefore this is

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.480 
arrow key p value and therefore this is
used<00:01:28.820> as<00:01:29.060> a<00:01:29.090> lifetime<00:01:29.539> work<00:01:29.719> and<00:01:30.130> this<00:01:31.130> command

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
used as a lifetime work and this command

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.310 
used as a lifetime work and this command
block<00:01:31.640> over<00:01:31.820> here<00:01:31.999> and<00:01:32.179> thus<00:01:32.509> the<00:01:32.539> same<00:01:32.899> but

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
block over here and thus the same but

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.760 
block over here and thus the same but
for<00:01:33.740> people<00:01:34.310> who<00:01:34.729> are<00:01:34.909> in<00:01:35.210> creative<00:01:35.630> only<00:01:36.999> so

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
for people who are in creative only so

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.609 
for people who are in creative only so
as<00:01:39.770> for<00:01:40.249> four<00:01:40.640> arrows<00:01:41.479> which<00:01:41.810> can<00:01:42.259> be<00:01:42.409> picked

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
as for four arrows which can be picked

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.959 
as for four arrows which can be picked
up<00:01:42.770> by<00:01:43.100> people<00:01:43.460> in<00:01:43.850> creative<00:01:44.240> only<00:01:44.539> this<00:01:45.350> works

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:45.969 
up by people in creative only this works

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:51.639 
up by people in creative only this works
because<00:01:46.969> of<00:01:47.179> reasons<00:01:48.039> and<00:01:49.039> I<00:01:49.789> I<00:01:50.689> first<00:01:51.439> had

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
because of reasons and I I first had

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.120 
because of reasons and I I first had
just<00:01:52.009> this<00:01:52.219> command<00:01:52.579> block<00:01:52.819> with<00:01:53.030> the<00:01:54.130> work

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
just this command block with the work

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.399 
just this command block with the work
can<00:01:55.460> be<00:01:56.149> picked<00:01:56.390> up<00:01:56.539> by<00:01:56.600> creative<00:01:57.170> and

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
can be picked up by creative and

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.149 
can be picked up by creative and
survival<00:01:57.590> but<00:01:58.069> some<00:01:58.340> times<00:01:59.799> only<00:02:00.799> this<00:02:00.920> one

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
survival but some times only this one

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.879 
survival but some times only this one
works<00:02:01.399> and<00:02:01.749> so<00:02:02.749> I<00:02:02.780> have<00:02:03.200> both<00:02:03.409> now<00:02:03.710> and<00:02:05.380> if<00:02:06.380> it

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:06.889 
works and so I have both now and if it

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:09.969 
works and so I have both now and if it
has<00:02:07.460> an<00:02:07.789> arrow<00:02:08.479> TP<00:02:09.080> value<00:02:09.379> between<00:02:09.560> one<00:02:09.950> and

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
has an arrow TP value between one and

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.190 
has an arrow TP value between one and
two<00:02:10.340> and<00:02:10.580> it<00:02:11.239> will<00:02:11.390> summon<00:02:11.599> an<00:02:11.780> arrow<00:02:11.959> on<00:02:12.170> the

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
two and it will summon an arrow on the

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.380 
two and it will summon an arrow on the
location<00:02:12.500> which<00:02:12.769> cannot<00:02:13.069> be

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
location which cannot be

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.590 
location which cannot be
picked<00:02:13.480> up<00:02:13.600> anymore<00:02:13.930> and<00:02:14.260> so<00:02:15.010> that<00:02:15.280> you<00:02:16.180> if<00:02:16.450> you

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
picked up anymore and so that you if you

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.010 
picked up anymore and so that you if you
get<00:02:16.810> sucked<00:02:17.080> into<00:02:18.040> this<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:19.240> center<00:02:19.630> so<00:02:19.840> if<00:02:19.930> I

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
get sucked into this the center so if I

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.900 
get sucked into this the center so if I
shoot<00:02:20.140> an<00:02:20.290> arrow<00:02:20.410> I<00:02:20.709> will<00:02:21.160> be<00:02:21.280> sucked<00:02:21.490> into<00:02:21.730> the

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
shoot an arrow I will be sucked into the

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.240 
shoot an arrow I will be sucked into the
center<00:02:22.270> so<00:02:23.200> that<00:02:23.230> you<00:02:23.500> do<00:02:23.620> not<00:02:23.650> pick<00:02:23.920> up<00:02:24.100> the

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
center so that you do not pick up the

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.809 
center so that you do not pick up the
arrow<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:25.620> there<00:02:26.620> will<00:02:26.770> no<00:02:26.980> not<00:02:27.490> be<00:02:27.700> an

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
arrow and there will no not be an

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.230 
arrow and there will no not be an
explosion<00:02:28.150> just<00:02:28.480> nice<00:02:28.780> public<00:02:29.140> effect<00:02:29.470> and

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
explosion just nice public effect and

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.199 
explosion just nice public effect and
yeah<00:02:31.240> that's<00:02:31.570> why<00:02:31.780> I<00:02:32.490> replace<00:02:33.490> the<00:02:33.730> first<00:02:33.970> ever

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
yeah that's why I replace the first ever

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:35.820 
yeah that's why I replace the first ever
with<00:02:34.420> an<00:02:34.540> arrow<00:02:34.720> that<00:02:35.020> cannot<00:02:35.350> be<00:02:35.410> picked<00:02:35.709> up

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
with an arrow that cannot be picked up

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.850 
with an arrow that cannot be picked up
anymore<00:02:36.100> and<00:02:36.630> then<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:37.870> first<00:02:38.020> one<00:02:38.320> is<00:02:38.350> killed

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.960 

also<00:02:41.860> then<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.220> second<00:02:42.550> arrow<00:02:42.700> has<00:02:42.940> a

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
also then the second arrow has a

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.720 
also then the second arrow has a
lifetime<00:02:43.270> are<00:02:43.660> as<00:02:44.410> you<00:02:44.500> can<00:02:44.650> see<00:02:44.830> four<00:02:45.160> arrows

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
lifetime are as you can see four arrows

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.990 
lifetime are as you can see four arrows
which<00:02:46.570> cannot<00:02:46.959> be<00:02:47.140> picked<00:02:47.350> up<00:02:47.610> this<00:02:48.610> time<00:02:48.820> it's

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
which cannot be picked up this time it's

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.080 
which cannot be picked up this time it's
called<00:02:49.270> arrow<00:02:49.600> time<00:02:49.959> and<00:02:50.700> after<00:02:52.739> one<00:02:53.739> tick<00:02:54.280> so

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
called arrow time and after one tick so

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.820 
called arrow time and after one tick so
if<00:02:55.300> the<00:02:55.480> error<00:02:55.630> time<00:02:55.870> is<00:02:56.080> exactly<00:02:56.470> one<00:02:56.680> and

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
if the error time is exactly one and

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.940 
if the error time is exactly one and
there<00:02:57.610> will<00:02:57.790> be<00:02:57.820> executed<00:02:58.750> particle<00:02:59.620> effect

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
there will be executed particle effect

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.449 
there will be executed particle effect
called<00:03:00.790> portal<00:03:01.360> on<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.769> arrows<00:03:02.769> location<00:03:03.250> and

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
called portal on the arrows location and

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.699 
called portal on the arrows location and
also<00:03:06.459> a<00:03:06.700> large<00:03:06.940> explosion<00:03:07.330> at<00:03:07.810> 49<00:03:08.290> tix<00:03:08.680> a

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
also a large explosion at 49 tix a

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.780 
also a large explosion at 49 tix a
fireworks<00:03:11.709> park<00:03:12.070> at<00:03:12.280> 48<00:03:12.730> and<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:14.680> cloudy<00:03:15.370> effect

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
fireworks park at 48 and a cloudy effect

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.069 
fireworks park at 48 and a cloudy effect
between<00:03:16.060> 10<00:03:16.660> and<00:03:16.690> 45<00:03:17.380> and<00:03:17.650> last<00:03:18.579> but<00:03:18.670> not<00:03:18.850> least

between 10 and 45 and last but not least
the<00:03:20.079> arrow<00:03:20.230> will<00:03:20.440> be<00:03:20.530> killed<00:03:20.799> so<00:03:21.310> if<00:03:21.400> I<00:03:21.489> shoot

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
the arrow will be killed so if I shoot

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.220 
the arrow will be killed so if I shoot
the<00:03:21.760> arrow<00:03:21.970> I'm<00:03:22.239> you<00:03:22.630> will<00:03:22.750> see<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.079> nice

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
the arrow I'm you will see the nice

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:30.680 
the arrow I'm you will see the nice
cloudy<00:03:25.019> faq<00:03:26.100> okay<00:03:27.100> this<00:03:27.850> kind<00:03:28.540> of<00:03:28.890> ruins<00:03:29.890> it<00:03:30.100> oh

the lifetime is between five and ten
cakes<00:04:02.230> and<00:04:02.670> then<00:04:03.670> this<00:04:04.030> one<00:04:04.090> and<00:04:04.630> resets<00:04:05.290> and

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
cakes and then this one and resets and

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.259 
the comparators with setting the success
count<00:04:09.940> 20<00:04:10.120> and<00:04:11.220> if<00:04:12.220> there<00:04:12.579> is<00:04:12.609> a<00:04:12.700> pulse<00:04:13.000> true

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.620 
count 20 and if there is a pulse true
and<00:04:13.900> it<00:04:14.230> will<00:04:14.440> summon<00:04:14.680> a<00:04:14.829> creeper<00:04:15.359> in<00:04:16.359> this

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
and it will summon a creeper in this

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.080 
and it will summon a creeper in this
little<00:04:16.930> cage<00:04:17.109> over<00:04:17.350> there<00:04:17.530> with<00:04:18.130> which<00:04:18.910> is

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
little cage over there with which is

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.250 
little cage over there with which is
ignited<00:04:19.660> and<00:04:20.609> has<00:04:21.609> some<00:04:21.880> active<00:04:22.360> affect<00:04:23.020> the

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
ignited and has some active affect the

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.650 
ignited and has some active affect the
first<00:04:23.500> one<00:04:23.710> is<00:04:23.919> invisibility<00:04:24.669> and<00:04:24.910> second

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
first one is invisibility and second

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.310 
first one is invisibility and second
is<00:04:26.070> resistance<00:04:27.070> so<00:04:27.450> the<00:04:28.450> first<00:04:28.690> creeper<00:04:29.170> does

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
is resistance so the first creeper does

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.400 
is resistance so the first creeper does
not<00:04:29.470> blow<00:04:29.650> up<00:04:29.800> the<00:04:29.950> second<00:04:30.280> one<00:04:30.310> and<00:04:31.200> also<00:04:32.200> on

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
not blow up the second one and also on

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.920 
not blow up the second one and also on
the<00:04:32.500> fast<00:04:32.680> clock<00:04:32.980> and<00:04:33.280> the<00:04:36.690> creepers<00:04:37.690> will

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
the fast clock and the creepers will

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.160 
the fast clock and the creepers will
have<00:04:38.850> another<00:04:39.850> life<00:04:40.120> timer<00:04:40.450> which<00:04:40.840> is<00:04:40.990> called

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.170 
have another life timer which is called

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.530 
have another life timer which is called
explode<00:04:41.590> right<00:04:42.010> here<00:04:42.280> so<00:04:42.520> three<00:04:42.940> live<00:04:43.180> cameras

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
explode right here so three live cameras

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:49.140 
explode right here so three live cameras
and<00:04:45.510> if<00:04:46.510> this<00:04:46.930> life<00:04:47.590> timer<00:04:47.920> for<00:04:48.670> the<00:04:48.730> creeper

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
and if this life timer for the creeper

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.450 
and if this life timer for the creeper
reaches<00:04:49.780> between<00:04:50.350> 5<00:04:50.800> and<00:04:51.040> 25<00:04:51.340> and<00:04:53.250> there's<00:04:54.250> an

reaches between 5 and 25 and there's an

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.220 
reaches between 5 and 25 and there's an
arrow<00:04:54.670> with<00:04:55.060> the<00:04:55.270> minimum<00:04:55.630> value<00:04:55.660> of<00:04:55.900> sorority

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
arrow with the minimum value of sorority

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.620 
arrow with the minimum value of sorority
and<00:04:56.410> the<00:04:56.590> maximum<00:04:56.770> value<00:04:57.040> of<00:04:57.250> 35<00:04:57.670> and<00:04:57.850> then<00:04:58.540> the

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
and the maximum value of 35 and then the

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.050 
and the maximum value of 35 and then the
creep<00:04:58.920> will<00:04:59.920> be<00:05:00.070> teleported<00:05:00.670> to<00:05:00.700> the<00:05:00.760> arrows

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
creep will be teleported to the arrows

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.040 
creep will be teleported to the arrows
location<00:05:01.510> and<00:05:02.490> yeah<00:05:03.490> as<00:05:03.760> you<00:05:03.880> can<00:05:03.940> see<00:05:04.180> this<00:05:04.870> is

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
location and yeah as you can see this is

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.920 
location and yeah as you can see this is
a<00:05:05.080> d<00:05:05.350> y<00:05:05.560> coordinate<00:05:06.460> of<00:05:06.550> 25<00:05:07.030> so<00:05:07.270> this<00:05:07.450> is<00:05:07.570> this

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
a d y coordinate of 25 so this is this

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.440 
a d y coordinate of 25 so this is this
straight<00:05:08.800> line<00:05:09.010> of<00:05:09.190> blocks<00:05:09.430> only<00:05:09.670> creepers<00:05:10.180> in

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
straight line of blocks only creepers in

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.000 
straight line of blocks only creepers in
this<00:05:10.600> line<00:05:10.810> of<00:05:10.840> blocks<00:05:11.200> will<00:05:11.380> be<00:05:11.500> teleported

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
this line of blocks will be teleported

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.330 
this line of blocks will be teleported
over<00:05:12.160> there<00:05:12.420> why<00:05:13.420> creepers<00:05:13.720> and<00:05:14.080> not<00:05:14.650> T&amp;T<00:05:15.070> and

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
over there why creepers and not T&amp;T and

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.900 
over there why creepers and not T&amp;T and
and<00:05:16.260> why<00:05:17.260> in<00:05:17.560> this<00:05:17.680> cage<00:05:17.980> and<00:05:18.190> not<00:05:18.310> directly<00:05:18.730> at

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
and why in this cage and not directly at

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.710 
and why in this cage and not directly at
the<00:05:19.000> arrow<00:05:19.230> the<00:05:20.230> first<00:05:20.530> reason<00:05:21.220> is<00:05:21.640> because<00:05:22.240> i

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
the arrow the first reason is because i

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.840 
the arrow the first reason is because i
do<00:05:22.870> not<00:05:23.200> want<00:05:23.350> the<00:05:23.980> arrows<00:05:24.220> to<00:05:24.250> blow<00:05:24.670> up

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:24.850 
do not want the arrows to blow up

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.570 
do not want the arrows to blow up
terrain<00:05:25.680> so<00:05:26.680> the<00:05:26.980> arrows<00:05:27.250> only<00:05:27.610> blow<00:05:27.790> up

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
terrain so the arrows only blow up

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.020 
terrain so the arrows only blow up
entities<00:05:30.580> and<00:05:30.820> not<00:05:31.440> not<00:05:32.440> the<00:05:32.500> blocks<00:05:32.920> and<00:05:33.220> the

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
entities and not not the blocks and the

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.360 
entities and not not the blocks and the
second<00:05:34.390> one<00:05:34.540> is<00:05:34.780> because<00:05:35.140> if<00:05:35.650> someone<00:05:36.220> an

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
second one is because if someone an

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.010 
second one is because if someone an
arrow<00:05:36.520> directly<00:05:37.090> on<00:05:37.210> the<00:05:37.330> location<00:05:37.570> with<00:05:37.990> a

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
arrow directly on the location with a

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.610 
arrow directly on the location with a
negative<00:05:38.530> effect<00:05:38.890> of<00:05:40.140> 14<00:05:41.140> which<00:05:41.440> is

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
negative effect of 14 which is

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.710 
negative effect of 14 which is
invisibility<00:05:42.100> sometimes<00:05:42.850> you<00:05:43.090> can<00:05:43.240> still<00:05:43.480> see

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
invisibility sometimes you can still see

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.200 
invisibility sometimes you can still see
the<00:05:43.840> creeper<00:05:44.169> and<00:05:44.350> this<00:05:44.620> sucks<00:05:44.860> and<00:05:45.210> because

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
the creeper and this sucks and because

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.409 
the creeper and this sucks and because
of<00:05:46.240> this<00:05:46.510> I've<00:05:46.840> done<00:05:47.230> this<00:05:47.530> crazy<00:05:48.490> stuff<00:05:49.000> here

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.419 
of this I've done this crazy stuff here

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:53.490 
of this I've done this crazy stuff here
and<00:05:49.540> complicated<00:05:50.440> stuff<00:05:51.450> to<00:05:52.450> first<00:05:52.900> spawn<00:05:53.320> the

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
and complicated stuff to first spawn the

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.260 
and complicated stuff to first spawn the
creep<00:05:53.680> over<00:05:53.800> there<00:05:54.070> and<00:05:54.250> then<00:05:54.370> teleport<00:05:55.150> it

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
creep over there and then teleport it

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:00.300 
creep over there and then teleport it
over<00:05:55.780> there<00:05:55.990> after<00:05:56.169> a<00:05:56.770> time<00:05:57.100> and<00:05:57.660> here<00:05:58.660> and<00:05:59.310> the

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
over there after a time and here and the

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.420

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130 
superfast clock are these command blocks

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.570 
superfast clock are these command blocks
which<00:06:06.610> have<00:06:06.910> a<00:06:06.940> wool<00:06:07.210> color<00:06:07.510> code<00:06:07.840> and<00:06:08.580> working

which have a wool color code and working

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:16.770 
which have a wool color code and working
clockwise<00:06:10.060> and<00:06:14.100> this<00:06:15.100> will<00:06:15.400> teleport<00:06:16.150> this<00:06:16.630> is

clockwise and this will teleport this is

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.920 
clockwise and this will teleport this is
for<00:06:16.930> the<00:06:16.960> gravitation<00:06:17.530> and<00:06:17.650> this<00:06:18.340> will

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930 
for the gravitation and this will

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.990 
for the gravitation and this will
execute<00:06:19.930> at<00:06:20.410> an<00:06:20.650> arrow<00:06:20.860> of<00:06:21.190> an<00:06:21.310> error<00:06:21.460> time<00:06:21.730> a

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 
execute at an arrow of an error time a

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.650 
execute at an arrow of an error time a
mini<00:06:22.390> value<00:06:22.660> of<00:06:22.750> 23<00:06:24.090> relatively<00:06:25.090> four<00:06:25.330> blocks

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:25.660 
mini value of 23 relatively four blocks

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.959 
mini value of 23 relatively four blocks
into<00:06:26.410> the<00:06:26.560> set<00:06:26.770> direction

00:06:29.959 --> 00:06:29.969 

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:32.749 

will<00:06:30.509> teleport<00:06:30.869> entities<00:06:31.679> on<00:06:32.009> exactly<00:06:32.669> that

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:32.759 
will teleport entities on exactly that

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:37.600 
will teleport entities on exactly that
block<00:06:34.759> into<00:06:35.759> the<00:06:36.239> negative<00:06:36.449> set<00:06:36.929> direction

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610 
block into the negative set direction

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.179 
block into the negative set direction
0.05<00:06:38.610> and<00:06:38.819> the<00:06:39.659> second<00:06:39.989> one<00:06:40.139> has<00:06:40.619> a<00:06:40.829> relative

00:06:41.179 --> 00:06:41.189 
0.05 and the second one has a relative

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:45.589 
0.05 and the second one has a relative
of<00:06:41.339> three<00:06:41.579> and<00:06:41.789> 0.1<00:06:42.599> so<00:06:44.179> this<00:06:45.179> is<00:06:45.299> of<00:06:45.419> course

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:45.599 
of three and 0.1 so this is of course

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:47.509 
of three and 0.1 so this is of course
the<00:06:45.809> first<00:06:46.019> blue<00:06:46.829> line<00:06:47.039> because<00:06:47.339> it's

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:47.519 
the first blue line because it's

00:06:47.519 --> 00:06:49.069 
the first blue line because it's
clockwise<00:06:47.909> so<00:06:48.269> this<00:06:48.419> is<00:06:48.539> the<00:06:48.599> first<00:06:48.839> blue

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:49.079 
clockwise so this is the first blue

00:06:49.079 --> 00:06:51.529 
clockwise so this is the first blue
block<00:06:49.319> and<00:06:49.559> this<00:06:50.339> is<00:06:50.459> the<00:06:50.610> top<00:06:50.789> line<00:06:51.059> and<00:06:51.269> then

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:51.539 
block and this is the top line and then

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:53.359 
block and this is the top line and then
works<00:06:51.779> clockwise<00:06:52.469> the<00:06:52.739> second<00:06:53.069> one<00:06:53.189> is<00:06:53.339> the

00:06:53.359 --> 00:06:53.369 
works clockwise the second one is the

00:06:53.369 --> 00:06:55.819 
works clockwise the second one is the
right<00:06:53.669> line<00:06:53.969> and<00:06:54.209> the<00:06:54.839> third<00:06:55.049> one<00:06:55.319> is<00:06:55.469> this<00:06:55.649> one

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:55.829 
right line and the third one is this one

00:06:55.829 --> 00:06:59.119 
right line and the third one is this one
at<00:06:56.009> the<00:06:56.069> fourth<00:06:56.309> one<00:06:56.519> is<00:06:56.639> this<00:06:56.789> one<00:06:56.849> and<00:06:57.889> yes<00:06:58.889> so

00:06:59.119 --> 00:06:59.129 
at the fourth one is this one and yes so

00:06:59.129 --> 00:07:05.169 
at the fourth one is this one and yes so
if<00:06:59.549> there<00:06:59.969> is<00:07:00.149> an<00:07:00.239> arrow<00:07:00.479> like<00:07:00.779> this<00:07:02.569> be

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:05.179 
if there is an arrow like this be

00:07:05.179 --> 00:07:08.929 
if there is an arrow like this be
execution<00:07:06.179> execute<00:07:07.019> command<00:07:07.349> will<00:07:07.939> check

00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:08.939 
execution execute command will check

00:07:08.939 --> 00:07:10.879 
execution execute command will check
foreign<00:07:09.360> player<00:07:09.599> that<00:07:09.869> is<00:07:09.989> one<00:07:10.199> two<00:07:10.529> three

if he reaches the next block they are
well<00:07:23.610> test<00:07:23.879> 123<00:07:24.829> this<00:07:25.829> is<00:07:25.979> three<00:07:26.249> relative<00:07:26.759> to

00:07:26.899 --> 00:07:26.909 
well test 123 this is three relative to

00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:29.179 
well test 123 this is three relative to
the<00:07:26.969> arrow<00:07:27.119> and<00:07:27.419> teleported<00:07:28.169> 0.1<00:07:28.829> it's<00:07:29.009> this

00:07:29.179 --> 00:07:29.189 
the arrow and teleported 0.1 it's this

00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:32.689 
the arrow and teleported 0.1 it's this
direction<00:07:29.489> and<00:07:29.699> the<00:07:30.389> next<00:07:30.629> one<00:07:30.869> and<00:07:31.699> will

00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:32.699 
direction and the next one and will

00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:36.619 
direction and the next one and will
teleport<00:07:33.209> in<00:07:33.689> 0.2<00:07:34.529> or<00:07:35.119> relatively<00:07:36.119> two<00:07:36.360> and

00:07:36.619 --> 00:07:36.629 
teleport in 0.2 or relatively two and

00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:41.600 
teleport in 0.2 or relatively two and
last<00:07:37.409> one<00:07:37.819> will<00:07:38.819> teleport<00:07:39.149> in<00:07:39.389> 0.3<00:07:40.249> so<00:07:41.249> the

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:41.610 
last one will teleport in 0.3 so the

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:43.249 
last one will teleport in 0.3 so the
closer<00:07:41.789> you<00:07:41.999> get<00:07:42.089> to<00:07:42.149> the<00:07:42.269> center<00:07:42.509> and<00:07:42.899> the

00:07:43.249 --> 00:07:43.259 
closer you get to the center and the

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:45.739 
closer you get to the center and the
harder<00:07:43.679> it<00:07:43.979> is<00:07:44.039> to<00:07:44.309> get<00:07:44.429> out<00:07:44.610> and<00:07:44.879> the<00:07:45.329> fast<00:07:45.539> add

00:07:45.739 --> 00:07:45.749 
harder it is to get out and the fast add

00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:48.999 
harder it is to get out and the fast add
a<00:07:45.809> faster<00:07:46.709> you<00:07:46.829> get<00:07:47.009> sucked<00:07:47.309> into<00:07:47.610> the<00:07:47.849> center

00:07:48.999 --> 00:07:49.009 
a faster you get sucked into the center

00:07:49.009 --> 00:07:51.799 
a faster you get sucked into the center
