installing<00:00:05.910> a<00:00:06.120> dimmer<00:00:06.330> switch<00:00:06.660> is<00:00:06.840> a<00:00:06.870> great

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
installing a dimmer switch is a great

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.140 
installing a dimmer switch is a great
way<00:00:07.350> to<00:00:07.380> save<00:00:07.710> energy<00:00:07.980> and<00:00:08.370> you<00:00:08.880> can<00:00:09.030> add

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
way to save energy and you can add

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.299 
way to save energy and you can add
ambience<00:00:09.600> to<00:00:09.809> any<00:00:09.990> room<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.680> kinds<00:00:11.010> of<00:00:11.070> dimmer

switches<00:00:11.610> we<00:00:11.850> have<00:00:12.030> in<00:00:12.180> our<00:00:12.299> homes<00:00:12.510> today<00:00:12.840> were

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:13.020 
switches we have in our homes today were

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.770 
switches we have in our homes today were
designed<00:00:13.500> for<00:00:13.740> incandescent<00:00:14.430> bulbs<00:00:15.030> now<00:00:15.600> with

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
designed for incandescent bulbs now with

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.260 
designed for incandescent bulbs now with
newer<00:00:15.990> lighting<00:00:16.440> technology<00:00:17.070> like<00:00:17.340> CFLs<00:00:18.000> and

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
newer lighting technology like CFLs and

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.380 
newer lighting technology like CFLs and
LEDs<00:00:18.619> to<00:00:19.619> get<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.980> best<00:00:20.279> performance<00:00:21.029> out<00:00:21.179> of

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
LEDs to get the best performance out of

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.599 
LEDs to get the best performance out of
those<00:00:21.539> dimmable<00:00:22.140> bulbs<00:00:22.439> you<00:00:23.160> should<00:00:23.400> use<00:00:23.580> a

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
those dimmable bulbs you should use a

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:30.109 
those dimmable bulbs you should use a
universal<00:00:24.179> dimmer<00:00:28.339> so<00:00:29.339> whenever<00:00:29.580> doing<00:00:29.789> any

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
universal dimmer so whenever doing any

universal dimmer so whenever doing any
electrical<00:00:30.660> work<00:00:30.810> safety<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.679> number<00:00:31.949> one

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
electrical work safety is the number one

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.490 
electrical work safety is the number one
priority<00:00:32.400> so<00:00:32.700> we<00:00:32.910> located<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.750> breaker<00:00:34.230> down

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
priority so we located the breaker down

is controlled by two switches you're
going<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.070> need<00:00:59.220> a<00:00:59.250> 3-way<00:00:59.820> dimmer<00:01:02.420> now<00:01:03.420> even

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
going to need a 3-way dimmer now even

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.289 
going to need a 3-way dimmer now even
though<00:01:03.900> we've<00:01:04.080> turned<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.619> breaker<00:01:04.799> off<00:01:05.299> we

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
though we've turned the breaker off we

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.330 
though we've turned the breaker off we
want<00:01:06.509> to<00:01:06.570> double<00:01:06.840> check<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.290> make<00:01:07.320> sure<00:01:07.799> that

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
want to double check to make sure that

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.330 
want to double check to make sure that
the<00:01:08.550> power<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:09.060> off<00:01:09.360> take<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.500> two<00:01:10.680> prongs<00:01:11.010> and

touch<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.820> against<00:01:12.150> these<00:01:12.300> screws<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.080> then

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
touch it against these screws and then

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.470 
touch it against these screws and then
even<00:01:13.710> test<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.160> against<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.550> ground<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:15.150> the

box if it doesn't light up no power
we're<00:01:18.840> ready<00:01:19.050> to<00:01:19.200> change<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.680> switch

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.340 

since<00:01:24.000> there's<00:01:24.210> plenty<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.630> wire<00:01:24.870> coming<00:01:25.200> out

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
since there's plenty of wire coming out

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.020 
since there's plenty of wire coming out
of<00:01:25.440> the<00:01:25.500> box<00:01:25.650> it's<00:01:26.190> alright<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.640> take<00:01:26.850> your

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030

the wires coming out of the box and a
separate<00:01:57.120> ground<00:01:57.479> wire<00:01:57.780> go<00:01:58.560> ahead<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:58.920> take

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
separate ground wire go ahead and take

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.430 
separate ground wire go ahead and take
the<00:01:59.370> stripped<00:01:59.700> wires<00:02:00.200> twist<00:02:01.200> them<00:02:01.409> around

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
the stripped wires twist them around

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.080 
the stripped wires twist them around
each<00:02:02.100> other<00:02:02.479> to<00:02:03.479> make<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.659> solid<00:02:04.110> connection

each other to make a solid connection

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.639 
each other to make a solid connection
then<00:02:06.090> use<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.270> wire<00:02:06.570> nut<00:02:07.099> to<00:02:08.099> finish<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.519> off

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
then use a wire nut to finish it off

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.780 
then use a wire nut to finish it off
depending<00:02:10.649> on<00:02:10.769> the<00:02:10.920> electrical<00:02:11.099> system<00:02:11.670> in
