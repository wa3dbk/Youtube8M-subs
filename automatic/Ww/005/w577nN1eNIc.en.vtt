00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.000
 the bible and the cell ' 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.280
 Ever wonder 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.540
 What would happen if your music treated our bibles 

00:00:11.069 --> 00:00:14.069
 the way we treat our home 

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:19.599
 and if we explain and spend our whole bible in our pocket or purse 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.920
 let's take a look at it several times a day 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.310
 and if we go back to pick it up when we forget about it at home 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.290
 or in the office 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.540
 This is to use bags to send messages to our friends. 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.880
 and if we treat her only as if we could not live without her 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.380
 those killers gift the kids 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.400
 and their collections when we travel 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.270
 and if we gave her up in case of an emergency 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.930
 unlike the cell phone 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.930
 The Bible is not without a sign. 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.930
 it's a stone anywhere 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.330
 No need to worry about the lack of credit 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.360
 Because Jesus already paid the bill. 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.690
 and the credits have no end 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.590
 And the best of all 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.530
 do not fall out 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.530
 and the battery charge is for a lifetime 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.280
 search still so safe 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.130
 while you can find 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.130
 call upon him while he is away 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.490
 in her 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.990
 we found some emergency phones 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.700
 when you are sad 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.700
 I connected John 14 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.940

 henrique has saved 91 

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:16.039
 when god seems far 

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:19.039
 he told the world 63 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:22.599
 when your faith needs to be filed 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.599
 I always biune to the sound of bells 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:29.179
 When you're lonely and afraid 

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:32.179
 henrique saved pedestrians 

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:35.759
 when you're the one he criticized 

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:39.239
 call 1 but the 13 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:40.319
 to know 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.669
 the secret of happiness 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:44.979

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.209
 we decided 12 to css 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.989

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:02.789
 Anytime you want, rest.

 Chapter 11 

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:08.929
 I thought there was a draw 

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:11.849
 when the world seems to be greater than God 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.949
 I have jumped 90 

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:17.489
 death on your agenda 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:23.139
 one of them might be sharp at any time in your life 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:28.689
 and pass it on to people you love 

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:30.879
 Can be 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:33.419
 that one of these emergency numbers 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:36.419
 I saved 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.819
 And God the absurd
