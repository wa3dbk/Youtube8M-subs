00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
was still recovered and in the end his

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.680 
was still recovered and in the end his
final<00:02:01.280> spurt<00:02:01.550> for<00:02:01.729> the<00:02:01.820> take<00:02:01.970> may<00:02:02.180> just<00:02:02.510> have

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690
