money<00:04:06.470> represents<00:04:06.739> the<00:04:07.310> ability<00:04:07.760> to<00:04:07.910> do<00:04:08.030> work

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
money represents the ability to do work

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.910 
money represents the ability to do work
it<00:04:09.410> has<00:04:09.590> a<00:04:09.620> physical<00:04:09.950> tangible

it has a physical tangible

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.220 
it has a physical tangible
to<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:11.430> planet<00:04:11.790> it's<00:04:12.030> not<00:04:12.780> energy

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
represented the ability it did I money

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.800

represents the ability to do work energy

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.500 
represents the ability to do work energy
is<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:19.560> ability<00:04:19.590> to<00:04:20.130> do<00:04:20.280> work<00:04:20.459> money<00:04:21.299> is<00:04:21.480> a

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
is the ability to do work money is a

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.580 
is the ability to do work money is a
symbol<00:04:22.019> for<00:04:22.290> the<00:04:22.320> ability<00:04:22.830> to<00:04:23.040> do<00:04:23.160> work<00:04:23.340> okay

symbol for the ability to do work okay

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.710 
symbol for the ability to do work okay
so<00:04:25.590> we<00:04:25.800> created<00:04:26.250> a<00:04:26.460> system<00:04:26.669> of<00:04:27.090> infinite

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
so we created a system of infinite

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.020 
so we created a system of infinite
growth<00:04:28.550> the<00:04:29.550> collided<00:04:30.150> with<00:04:30.180> finite<00:04:30.630> energy

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
growth the collided with finite energy

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.890 
growth the collided with finite energy
well<00:04:33.030> if<00:04:33.090> you're<00:04:33.180> looking<00:04:33.389> at<00:04:33.419> the<00:04:33.540> chart<00:04:33.690> this

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
well if you're looking at the chart this

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.550 
well if you're looking at the chart this
way<00:04:34.080> it<00:04:34.230> collided<00:04:34.500> that<00:04:34.770> way<00:04:34.919> okay<00:04:35.820> when<00:04:36.560> money

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
way it collided that way okay when money

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.260 
way it collided that way okay when money
is<00:04:37.830> out<00:04:38.130> there<00:04:38.370> but<00:04:38.550> there's<00:04:38.760> only<00:04:38.820> so<00:04:38.940> much

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
is out there but there's only so much

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.940 
is out there but there's only so much
energy<00:04:39.510> to<00:04:39.810> do<00:04:39.930> anything<00:04:39.960> with<00:04:40.530> that<00:04:40.560> money

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
energy to do anything with that money

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.530 
energy to do anything with that money
and<00:04:41.040> that's<00:04:41.400> where<00:04:41.669> the<00:04:41.790> system<00:04:42.180> breaks<00:04:42.419> down

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
and that's where the system breaks down

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.930 
and that's where the system breaks down
and<00:04:42.750> that's<00:04:42.900> essentially<00:04:43.350> the<00:04:43.530> point<00:04:43.940> that's

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
and that's essentially the point that's

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.430 
and that's essentially the point that's
one<00:04:45.210> of<00:04:45.300> the<00:04:45.360> ways<00:04:45.450> of<00:04:45.570> describing<00:04:45.780> the<00:04:46.200> point

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
one of the ways of describing the point

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.780 
one of the ways of describing the point
that<00:04:46.560> we're<00:04:46.710> at<00:04:46.860> now<00:04:47.389> so<00:04:48.389> two<00:04:49.160> for<00:04:50.160> individuals

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
that we're at now so two for individuals

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.400 
that we're at now so two for individuals
to<00:04:50.880> deal<00:04:51.210> with<00:04:51.419> that<00:04:51.540> you<00:04:51.690> need<00:04:51.870> to<00:04:51.930> disengage

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
to deal with that you need to disengage

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.230 
to deal with that you need to disengage
from<00:04:52.740> that<00:04:52.950> system<00:04:53.160> of<00:04:53.460> infinite<00:04:53.850> growth<00:04:54.000> as

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
from that system of infinite growth as

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.500 
from that system of infinite growth as
much<00:04:54.419> as<00:04:54.600> possible<00:04:54.780> and<00:04:55.770> I<00:04:56.000> goal<00:04:57.000> is<00:04:57.180> my<00:04:57.330> only

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
much as possible and I goal is my only

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.140 
much as possible and I goal is my only
investment<00:04:58.250> okay<00:04:59.250> that's<00:04:59.580> just<00:04:59.669> a<00:04:59.910> choice

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
investment okay that's just a choice

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.790 
investment okay that's just a choice
that<00:05:00.360> I<00:05:00.389> make<00:05:02.300> but<00:05:03.300> at<00:05:03.990> some<00:05:04.260> point<00:05:04.290> we<00:05:04.650> will

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
that I make but at some point we will

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.560 
that I make but at some point we will
have<00:05:04.979> to<00:05:05.130> return<00:05:05.340> to<00:05:05.760> a<00:05:05.790> point<00:05:06.120> where<00:05:06.150> money

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
have to return to a point where money

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.469 
have to return to a point where money
represents<00:05:06.990> some<00:05:07.950> physical<00:05:08.639> limitation<00:05:09.360> on

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479 
represents some physical limitation on

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:13.219 
represents some physical limitation on
the<00:05:09.600> planet<00:05:10.910> because<00:05:11.910> the<00:05:12.060> way<00:05:12.660> we<00:05:12.690> see<00:05:13.050> now

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:13.229 
the planet because the way we see now

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:16.250 
the planet because the way we see now
and<00:05:13.470> you<00:05:13.860> know<00:05:13.979> this<00:05:14.100> is<00:05:14.250> probably<00:05:14.750> it's<00:05:15.750> 25

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
and you know this is probably it's 25

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.409 
and you know this is probably it's 25
years<00:05:16.500> ago<00:05:16.650> I<00:05:16.850> would<00:05:17.850> be<00:05:17.970> saying<00:05:18.180> that<00:05:18.330> the

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
years ago I would be saying that the

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:22.340 
years ago I would be saying that the
only<00:05:18.539> people<00:05:18.900> who<00:05:19.020> get<00:05:19.229> screwed<00:05:19.530> are<00:05:21.350> the

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
only people who get screwed are the

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.140 
only people who get screwed are the
little<00:05:22.500> people<00:05:22.890> the<00:05:23.070> ones<00:05:23.250> who<00:05:23.400> are<00:05:23.520> but<00:05:24.000> they

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
little people the ones who are but they

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.150 
little people the ones who are but they
were<00:05:24.210> all<00:05:24.419> buying<00:05:24.720> houses<00:05:25.020> five<00:05:25.650> years<00:05:25.979> ago

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
were all buying houses five years ago

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.670 
were all buying houses five years ago
they<00:05:26.460> were<00:05:26.490> all<00:05:26.789> expanded<00:05:27.390> credit<00:05:27.750> and<00:05:27.930> you're

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
they were all expanded credit and you're

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.469 
they were all expanded credit and you're
working<00:05:29.010> but<00:05:29.160> they're<00:05:29.640> the<00:05:29.789> only<00:05:29.940> ones<00:05:30.210> paying

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 
working but they're the only ones paying

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:32.420 
working but they're the only ones paying
the<00:05:30.630> price<00:05:30.810> now<00:05:30.870> you<00:05:31.860> and<00:05:32.070> I<00:05:32.130> are<00:05:32.160> the<00:05:32.400> only

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
the price now you and I are the only

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.300 
the price now you and I are the only
ones<00:05:32.700> paying<00:05:33.120> the<00:05:33.300> price<00:05:33.479> for<00:05:33.539> the<00:05:33.840> bailout

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
ones paying the price for the bailout

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.270 
ones paying the price for the bailout
that's<00:05:35.310> our<00:05:35.490> tax<00:05:35.850> money<00:05:36.030> and<00:05:36.419> so<00:05:37.130> put<00:05:38.130> yourself

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
that's our tax money and so put yourself

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.159 
that's our tax money and so put yourself
in<00:05:38.700> a<00:05:38.760> position<00:05:38.789> where<00:05:39.240> you<00:05:39.510> don't<00:05:39.720> need<00:05:39.960> to<00:05:40.080> be

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
in a position where you don't need to be

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:41.870 
in a position where you don't need to be
bailed<00:05:40.380> out<00:05:40.530> because<00:05:40.860> nobody's<00:05:41.400> ever<00:05:41.700> going

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
bailed out because nobody's ever going

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.229 
bailed out because nobody's ever going
to<00:05:41.940> come<00:05:42.120> bail<00:05:42.390> the<00:05:42.570> individuals<00:05:43.080> out
