00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
these things that the bolt has enough

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.509 
these things that the bolt has enough
flotation<00:01:00.309> for<00:01:01.090> a<00:01:01.120> pretty<00:01:01.809> hefty<00:01:02.079> love<00:01:02.469> so<00:01:03.039> is

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
floating and it sets pretty good in the

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.260 
floating and it sets pretty good in the
in<00:01:10.240> the<00:01:10.270> water<00:01:10.630> so<00:01:11.020> let<00:01:11.860> me<00:01:12.010> reset<00:01:12.550> up<00:01:12.730> and<00:01:13.030> then

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
has a great amount of influence on how a

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.950 
has a great amount of influence on how a
boat<00:01:50.979> rides<00:01:51.280> when<00:01:52.060> you<00:01:52.180> have<00:01:52.299> people<00:01:52.509> in<00:01:52.840> it

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.630 
boat rides when you have people in it
and<00:01:53.259> then<00:01:53.619> on<00:01:53.770> the<00:01:53.890> eight<00:01:53.979> like<00:01:54.219> I<00:01:54.340> said<00:01:54.520> before

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
and then on the eight like I said before

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.249 
and then on the eight like I said before
the<00:01:55.000> eight-foot<00:01:55.360> nuthatch<00:01:55.689> I<00:01:55.869> had<00:01:55.990> to<00:01:56.079> change

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
the eight-foot nuthatch I had to change

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.260

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
the seat side from side to side to for a

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.179 
the seat side from side to side to for a
nap<00:01:58.450> like<00:01:58.719> I<00:01:58.869> did<00:01:59.049> later<00:01:59.259> on<00:01:59.469> the<00:01:59.590> pudgy<00:01:59.799> design

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
nap like I did later on the pudgy design

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:05.609 
nap like I did later on the pudgy design
so<00:02:00.759> and<00:02:01.390> then<00:02:01.869> on<00:02:02.020> the<00:02:02.259> O&amp;P<00:02:03.009> pod<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:04.420> seat<00:02:04.659> when

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
you have two people the rover has to

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.340 
you have two people the rover has to
move<00:02:08.619> to<00:02:09.009> the<00:02:09.250> forward<00:02:09.670> seat<00:02:10.000> because<00:02:10.750> on<00:02:10.899> w

move to the forward seat because on w

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.610 
move to the forward seat because on w

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
you don't have a lot of flotation

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.070 
you don't have a lot of flotation
they're<00:02:14.800> not<00:02:15.040> like<00:02:15.250> on<00:02:15.460> a<00:02:15.490> pram<00:02:15.880> and<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.810> same

and we're back in to do level trim again
so<00:04:36.820> as<00:04:36.970> i<00:04:37.090> said<00:04:37.120> i've<00:04:37.600> already<00:04:37.810> got<00:04:38.280> these

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
so as i said i've already got these

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:46.920 
so as i said i've already got these
points<00:04:39.760> figured<00:04:40.480> out<00:04:40.660> before<00:04:40.870> so<00:04:41.530> I<00:04:45.540> know<00:04:46.540> now

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
points figured out before so I know now

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:54.840 
points figured out before so I know now
from<00:04:47.320> measuring<00:04:51.150> that<00:04:52.150> the<00:04:52.360> app<00:04:52.510> point<00:04:53.850> it's

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
from measuring that the app point it's

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.910 
from measuring that the app point it's
two<00:04:55.060> and<00:04:55.180> a<00:04:55.240> half<00:04:55.390> inches<00:04:55.510> from<00:04:55.930> the<00:04:56.020> very

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:56.920 
two and a half inches from the very

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:04.370 
two and a half inches from the very
stern<00:04:57.280> of<00:04:57.730> the<00:04:58.290> at<00:04:59.290> the<00:04:59.440> top<00:04:59.650> and<00:05:02.310> five<00:05:03.310> and

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
stern of the at the top and five and

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.530 
stern of the at the top and five and
three-quarters<00:05:05.910> and<00:05:06.910> I<00:05:07.000> know<00:05:07.150> I've<00:05:07.270> got<00:05:07.390> that

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
three-quarters and I know I've got that

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:14.610 
three-quarters and I know I've got that
back<00:05:07.810> more<00:05:08.440> than<00:05:09.600> institutional<00:05:13.380> five<00:05:14.380> and<00:05:14.590> a

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
back more than institutional five and a

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.770 
back more than institutional five and a
half<00:05:14.650> for<00:05:15.190> the<00:05:15.220> middle<00:05:15.550> seat<00:05:16.920> and<00:05:18.570> eight<00:05:19.570> and<00:05:19.720> a

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
half for the middle seat and eight and a

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.130 
half for the middle seat and eight and a
half<00:05:19.810> for<00:05:20.770> the<00:05:20.800> Dow<00:05:20.980> C<00:05:21.630> so<00:05:22.630> I<00:05:22.660> know<00:05:22.810> those

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.140 
half for the Dow C so I know those

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.740 
half for the Dow C so I know those
positions<00:05:23.590> now<00:05:24.520> the<00:05:24.580> only<00:05:25.060> thing<00:05:25.180> that<00:05:25.630> will

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
positions now the only thing that will

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.600 
positions now the only thing that will
affect<00:05:26.200> the<00:05:26.800> center<00:05:27.670> seat<00:05:28.710> position<00:05:29.710> is<00:05:29.890> when

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
affect the center seat position is when

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.090 
affect the center seat position is when
I<00:05:30.640> still<00:05:31.390> haven't<00:05:31.600> one<00:05:31.990> more<00:05:32.170> test<00:05:32.440> to<00:05:32.590> do<00:05:32.830> and

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
I still haven't one more test to do and

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.950 
I still haven't one more test to do and
i<00:05:33.160> think<00:05:33.340> i'll<00:05:33.490> make<00:05:33.640> that<00:05:33.670> another<00:05:34.030> another

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 
i think i'll make that another another

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.870 
i think i'll make that another another
video<00:05:35.410> I<00:05:35.680> need<00:05:36.430> to<00:05:36.550> do<00:05:36.700> my<00:05:38.070> center<00:05:39.070> of<00:05:39.100> lateral

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
video I need to do my center of lateral

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:46.290 
video I need to do my center of lateral
resistance<00:05:40.420> and<00:05:40.840> my<00:05:42.930> he'll<00:05:43.930> leave<00:05:44.110> only<00:05:45.300> know

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
resistance and my he'll leave only know

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.850 
resistance and my he'll leave only know
where<00:05:46.720> you<00:05:46.810> do<00:05:46.960> the<00:05:46.990> sale<00:05:47.350> in<00:05:47.590> the<00:05:47.710> whole

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
where you do the sale in the whole

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.100 
where you do the sale in the whole
masses<00:05:48.400> and<00:05:48.670> so<00:05:48.970> to<00:05:49.450> figure<00:05:49.630> out<00:05:49.810> what<00:05:50.020> the

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
masses and so to figure out what the

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.030 
masses and so to figure out what the
daggerboard<00:05:50.410> some<00:05:50.740> ID<00:05:50.980> so<00:05:52.530> I'll<00:05:53.530> think<00:05:53.920> of

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:54.040 
daggerboard some ID so I'll think of

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.440 
daggerboard some ID so I'll think of
that<00:05:54.190> there<00:05:54.430> will<00:05:54.550> be<00:05:54.580> a<00:05:54.670> little<00:05:54.850> caption<00:05:55.330> on

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.450 
that there will be a little caption on

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.640 
that there will be a little caption on
the<00:05:55.480> bottom<00:05:55.840> here<00:05:55.960> when<00:05:56.170> I'm<00:05:56.290> doing<00:05:56.470> this

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
the bottom here when I'm doing this

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.200 
the bottom here when I'm doing this
we'll<00:05:59.650> go<00:05:59.770> ahead<00:05:59.860> and<00:06:00.070> do<00:06:00.190> that<00:06:00.220> on<00:06:00.670> the<00:06:01.000> next

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
we'll go ahead and do that on the next

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.790 
we'll go ahead and do that on the next
one<00:06:01.450> so<00:06:01.630> this<00:06:01.780> is<00:06:01.930> pretty<00:06:02.110> much<00:06:02.230> it<00:06:02.410> for<00:06:02.650> this

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
one so this is pretty much it for this

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:10.470 
one so this is pretty much it for this
boat<00:06:05.550> me<00:06:08.070> I'll<00:06:09.070> go<00:06:09.160> ahead

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:10.480 
boat me I'll go ahead

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:16.730 
boat me I'll go ahead
we<00:06:12.000> move<00:06:13.000> this<00:06:13.150> around<00:06:13.360> so<00:06:13.920> you<00:06:14.920> can<00:06:15.160> see<00:06:15.340> the

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740 
we move this around so you can see the

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.080 
we move this around so you can see the
resting<00:06:17.740> point<00:06:17.950> this<00:06:18.160> is<00:06:18.340> the<00:06:18.460> three<00:06:18.730> people

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
resting point this is the three people

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:27.960 
resting point this is the three people
on<00:06:19.270> it<00:06:23.880> and<00:06:24.880> again<00:06:25.540> with<00:06:25.750> three<00:06:26.020> people<00:06:26.970> and

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:27.970 
on it and again with three people and

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.560 
on it and again with three people and
then<00:06:28.360> let's<00:06:28.600> go<00:06:28.870> with<00:06:29.200> just<00:06:29.320> a<00:06:29.500> single<00:06:29.680> person

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:30.570 
then let's go with just a single person

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:33.110 
then let's go with just a single person

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.480 
we're going to when i get done laying
out<00:07:01.930> the<00:07:02.080> boat<00:07:02.260> and<00:07:02.410> cutting<00:07:02.800> out<00:07:02.950> the<00:07:03.130> panels

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:03.490 
out the boat and cutting out the panels

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.430 
out the boat and cutting out the panels
of<00:07:03.610> the<00:07:03.640> wire<00:07:03.820> him<00:07:04.150> up<00:07:04.240> that<00:07:04.450> first<00:07:04.660> time<00:07:05.020> i<00:07:05.050> get

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:05.440 
of the wire him up that first time i get

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.340 
of the wire him up that first time i get
my<00:07:05.590> aww<00:07:05.620> moment<00:07:06.070> when<00:07:06.700> the<00:07:06.880> hull<00:07:07.090> is<00:07:07.720> all<00:07:08.050> wired

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:08.350 
my aww moment when the hull is all wired

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:11.340 
my aww moment when the hull is all wired
up<00:07:08.680> and<00:07:08.920> i<00:07:09.820> can<00:07:09.970> see<00:07:10.180> what<00:07:10.390> the<00:07:10.540> she's<00:07:11.050> going<00:07:11.290> to

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:11.350 
up and i can see what the she's going to

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:15.690 
up and i can see what the she's going to
look<00:07:11.530> like<00:07:12.150> so<00:07:13.150> i<00:07:13.950> guess<00:07:14.950> that<00:07:15.310> would<00:07:15.430> be<00:07:15.550> it

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:15.700 
look like so i guess that would be it

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.460 
look like so i guess that would be it
for<00:07:15.880> this<00:07:16.060> this<00:07:16.510> little<00:07:16.690> segment<00:07:17.050> that's

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:17.470 
for this this little segment that's

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.950 
for this this little segment that's
basically<00:07:17.890> how<00:07:18.040> i<00:07:18.390> float<00:07:19.390> my<00:07:19.540> boats<00:07:19.780> and

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:19.960 
basically how i float my boats and

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.980 
basically how i float my boats and
figure<00:07:20.260> out<00:07:20.290> where<00:07:20.620> the<00:07:21.130> seats<00:07:21.610> go<00:07:21.850> the<00:07:22.750> next

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:22.990 
figure out where the seats go the next

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:24.930 
figure out where the seats go the next
thing<00:07:23.110> coming<00:07:23.290> up<00:07:23.590> I<00:07:23.800> depends<00:07:24.670> when<00:07:24.790> maybe

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:24.940 
thing coming up I depends when maybe

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:26.280 
thing coming up I depends when maybe
I've<00:07:25.090> got<00:07:25.270> a<00:07:25.300> few<00:07:25.510> minutes<00:07:25.870> I'll<00:07:26.020> see<00:07:26.170> how<00:07:26.260> long

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:26.290 
I've got a few minutes I'll see how long

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:29.550 
I've got a few minutes I'll see how long
this<00:07:26.650> one<00:07:26.860> runs<00:07:27.100> i'll<00:07:28.030> throw<00:07:28.390> in<00:07:28.420> the<00:07:28.900> lateral

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:29.560 
this one runs i'll throw in the lateral

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.710 
this one runs i'll throw in the lateral
resistance<00:07:30.100> and<00:07:30.370> center<00:07:30.970> of<00:07:31.060> effort<00:07:31.300> on<00:07:31.390> sales

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:31.720 
resistance and center of effort on sales

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.680 
resistance and center of effort on sales
in<00:07:31.990> the<00:07:32.170> lateral<00:07:33.040> resistance<00:07:33.490> in<00:07:33.700> the<00:07:33.820> hull<00:07:34.000> so

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:34.690 
in the lateral resistance in the hull so

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:39.150 
in the lateral resistance in the hull so
that<00:07:34.720> would<00:07:35.650> be<00:07:35.710> enough<00:07:35.860> of<00:07:35.980> this

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:39.160 

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.220
