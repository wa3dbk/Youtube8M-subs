missions<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.960> replay<00:00:58.350> now<00:00:58.559> since<00:00:59.190> rooftop

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
missions to replay now since rooftop

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.670 
missions to replay now since rooftop
rumble<00:00:59.789> is<00:00:59.969> screwed<00:01:00.239> up<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:01.230> takes<00:01:01.530> a

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
rumble is screwed up and it takes a

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.950 
rumble is screwed up and it takes a
while<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:02.219> actually<00:01:02.370> go<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.090> online<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.840> then

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
while to actually go to online and then

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.260 
while to actually go to online and then
click<00:01:04.350> on<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.739> job<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.640> start<00:01:05.820> back<00:01:06.000> up<00:01:06.030> again

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
click on the job and start back up again

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.330 
click on the job and start back up again
so<00:01:06.659> putting<00:01:07.140> in<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.380> playlist<00:01:07.799> can<00:01:08.040> pretty<00:01:08.250> much

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
so putting in a playlist can pretty much

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.520 
so putting in a playlist can pretty much
just<00:01:08.820> make<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.360> replay<00:01:09.810> over<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.200> over<00:01:10.350> again

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
just make it replay over and over again

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.649 
just make it replay over and over again
really<00:01:11.070> fastly<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:12.030> once<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.330> start<00:01:12.570> the

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
really fastly so once you start the

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:13.730 
really fastly so once you start the
mission<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:13.170> just<00:01:13.320> want<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.470> put<00:01:13.619> your

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
mission you just want to put your

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.859 
mission you just want to put your
weather<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.250> clear<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.210> your<00:01:15.479> time<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.780> data

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
weather to clear and your time of data

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.149 
weather to clear and your time of data
noon<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.409> can<00:01:16.530> see<00:01:16.680> everything<00:01:17.009> clearly

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
noon so you can see everything clearly

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.800 
noon so you can see everything clearly
and<00:01:17.610> then<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.150> just<00:01:18.299> want<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.540> pretty<00:01:18.659> much

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
and then you just want to pretty much

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.620 
and then you just want to pretty much
snipe<00:01:19.140> everyone<00:01:19.650> on<00:01:19.680> this<00:01:20.580> island<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:21.330> doesn't
