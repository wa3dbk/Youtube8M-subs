00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.560
 ah 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:20.410
 very good because I had the time 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.410
 suspicion 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.529
 in the pool where he had left 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:29.020
 at ease to my fish for the theme of 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.300
 the reform of the pond and that then I 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.610
 I assumed they had raised because 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.710
 you have already seen that I got a 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.239
 fry me what good after the 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.370
 water lilies because I thought they were going 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.530
 to eat that is normal not to lose you is 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.940
 big ones are committed small like this 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.530
 peaceful that the tents are then 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.100
 long ago the water is very green 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.260
 then it does not look good and it's been a while since 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.269
 when I was watching for a while 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.979
 fish that did not recognize fish very 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.589
 little ones that recognized us and of course I 

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:01.809
 I just said the same said I think they have 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:03.070
 raised that there are many fish and I think 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.420
 that we're going to get a lot more fish out of the 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.830
 what did we put 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.909
 and today I have chosen the sacdera for 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.409
 investigate a little bit what happens to me 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.600
 I plateaued good I pond in the pool 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.930
 because this weekend we're going to 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.689
 put the fish in the pond is already 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.880
 and it takes three days to circulate and takes 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:23.170
 three days filter maturing a week 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.659
 that made many, many liters 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.119
 plants and this water apart goes with zeal 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.680
 nitrate so it's a week more than a 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.330
 week so that for the water 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.830
 mature for what 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:39.190
 the filter of the maturity filter and for the 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.590
 cycle then already today the third day I'm going 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.180
 to put a single fish in the pond like this 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.160
 I was going to take out one of these fish 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.260
 little ones that nobody thinks that this is 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.700
 a test decisions and do not die the 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.970
 fish will be perfectly not going to be 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.710
 nothing, notice what I have taken 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.080
 undoubtedly 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.610
 a fuck kite the variety of letters 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.799
 long the color has taken the color 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.960
 original is funny because I do not have 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.490
 no faces with the original color and 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.640
 This has taken the original color on 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:10.509
 brown cillo is like this a little bit 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:14.140
 copper does not copper bronze so the type 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.370
 heavy metal and there it is and apart 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.130
 He has to be a brother of whom I 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.860
 take to the aquarium that we made the last 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.709
 video that had 77 days for the 90 days 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.050
 more or less are days three months and of course 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:29.260
 mine is half the size that 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.940
 this what shows us that if they have 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.690
 space to grow grow much more 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.030
 Quick 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.030
 Look, I 've been observing a little bit 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.490
 you see what I tell you has the color 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.110
 original good has the original color and 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.180
 the very long fins 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.240
 that's because it's a kite variety and 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.520
 I have also realized that he has a 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.160
 malformation in the mouth you will see 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.620
 I want to express it as little as possible 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.680
 look 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.290
 You see the mouth is deformed but 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.790
 obviously it has not meant a 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.040
 problem to grow because the fish has 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.280
 Very big place too big to do 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.739
 a fish with three months so I already 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.340
 water lilies have reached the surface what 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.200
 you will see later in a video 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.700
 the plants are growing the water is 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.739
 maturing the center we are also going to 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.620
 throw them out and will be the only inhabitant 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.180
 in the pond until now 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.690
 let's get all the big fish to see 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.700
 how the fish moves by the 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.950
 with the pond to see if it gets in 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.379
 where the stones of the fucking wall 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.120
 to see if it has some kind of problem 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:39.129
 of inconvenience or if everything is fine 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.180
 before putting the other fish the 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:43.840
 big fish that are what really 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:46.959
 can create problems well then what 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.519
 said let's proceed to release the 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.870
 fish we had already had a while here for 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.120
 that acclimate to the temperature of the 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.860
 Water 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.490
 and let's see 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:01.290
 how do you think it already came to this 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.290
 little fish to this three-month levin 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.790
 what do you think of his new 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.790
 pond 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.660
 is entering the river 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.550
 and it turns around 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.890
 now the best is possible at the beginning 

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.930
 that 's why it 's good to put fish to make 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.170
 tests without compromising health 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.380
 of the fish 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.380
 and 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.320
 it's important or I was saying that 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.600
 it's possible 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:37.830
 that the fish in principle give them 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:40.460
 afraid to enter the river because 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:43.980
 the river has 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.900
 You see the psg the little screen is 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.490
 the king has a little tubular formation 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.780
 apart it has some walkways above 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.730
 It can give you a little bit of a sense of 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.160
 claustrophobia to the fish or just 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.450
 refuse to enter in principle but we 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.090
 they will end up walking around here 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.680
 quietly good as well as the stand 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.630
 that has the extremes I have gone to the 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:04.380
 pool to get another one from bing look at this 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:08.330
 what a nice fish thing to remember 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:10.360
 that a juvenile that has three months looks 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:13.110
 Let's see 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.110
 here 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.710
 look how nice, so let's go 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.960
 drop it on the other end in the other 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:25.169
 end of the pond 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:28.830
 Well here you already have your little bit of 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:32.449
 acclimation cycle let's release them 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:36.490
 and let's willy willy carry 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:40.270
 and see what you think of your new home 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.270
 the less big man 

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:48.460
 and there I think we're going to lose it 

00:05:46.989 --> 00:05:52.389
 little sight 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:55.060
 Well, nothing here this video of 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:57.280
 today is that only the release of a couple 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:00.130
 of fry on the opposite side of 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.669
 pond and there we already have a pnv menu at 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.669
 who has reached the top 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.610
 on the other side there is also some place 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:10.669
 that has taken up that rubber follow and 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.740
 loose at the expense of us putting the 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:16.150
 air the aerator 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:19.630
 and good to me forbid the little fish 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:22.360
 this is a cat for the profane of the 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:26.249
 matter there is the little fish now 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:28.289
 same next to the pump 

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:30.239
 it looks very bad still the chapel is of 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:31.589
 dust here until I turn on the filter 

00:06:30.239 --> 00:06:34.289
 and the filter but it's still not me 

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:36.739
 you listen to a hug and until the next 

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:36.739
 video
