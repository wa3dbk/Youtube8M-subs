00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 hello guys welcome to set up 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.750
 teams in the next few minutes we're going 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.730
 to talk about the news more 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.100
 interesting that we have known in the 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.430
 last hours so we start 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.430
 but 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.230
 How about guys to start we come to 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.480
 talk about one of the phones that 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.330
 Thicken the terminal catalog of 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.670
 htc has been during the ces de las vegas 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:31.810
 where the manufacturer has submitted its of 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:34.059
 6 829 a terminal that is not a gamma stop 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.670
 a premium phone but it does include 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:39.070
 three in traits we wanted to share 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.309
 with you and highlight to start 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:45.250
 this 16 of 829 is the first in the house 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.320
 in offering android series 5.0 lollipop 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.970
 that is, he benefits from the 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.340
 news and the best of the last 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.040
 Android version of course always 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.290
 goes with the sense interface another of the 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.600
 features or aspects that highlight to 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.420
 this terminal is that it is the first 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.180
 also from the company to include 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.070
 series its ultra pixel technology in the 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.800
 front camera without a doubt a 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.869
 tribute to srcei lovers the 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.110
 third feature that we liked that we 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.910
 has caught the attention of this design 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.490
 829 is that it is also the first terminal 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.979
 of the company in including a processor 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.540
 64 bits specifically is the 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.060
 snapdragon 600 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.910
 It is not the most powerful in the market but 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.680
 well we guarantee at least a good 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.560
 efficiency a good relationship between 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.620
 Power and energy consumption with a lot 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.020
 less gross power will undoubtedly move 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:40.330
 applications much more fluently other 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.340
 of the terminals that htc has presented 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.370
 during the ces de las vegas is that of 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.410
 sawyer 320 a phone that moves away 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.930
 a lot of this previous and the top 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.760
 current ranges but that will undoubtedly 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.890
 suppose a good bet to a good 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.410
 proposal for what we define the 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.960
 low cost mobile because because of the 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.330
 sawyer 320 will hit the market below 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.580
 of that psychological margin of that level 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.979
 of the 100 euros because because we have 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.720
 a very very restrained phone at the level of 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.000
 specifications we talk about a 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.670
 4.5 inch screen with a 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.220
 very low resolution only 512 megabytes of 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.290
 ram memory a quad-core processor that 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.750
 yes but also a photographic section 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.180
 very short talk about a 5 sensor 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.190
 megapixels a 2100 battery 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.260
 milliamperes finally we talk about a 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.390
 terminal as we said focused on the 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.350
 ranges of entry for people who do not 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.780
 they have or can not 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.970
 a lot of money in a terminal and that only 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.250
 conform to the basics but has 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.420
 there were many more announcements during the 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.610
 ces and one that we thought 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.120
 interesting to note is the one that has done 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.460
 envy is your nvidia tegra processor x 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.560
 1 so that we understand it is the first 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.200
 mobile processor of the world with a 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.090
 power of a teraflop and if you do not know 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.640
 what does this mean we will make you one 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.640
 comparison fixed in the processor 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.860
 playstation 4 for example that is 1.8 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.380
 teraflops well this processor 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.260
 mobile that announces envy during the ces 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.790
 Las Vegas is almost half as powerful 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.310
 that is to say that in a very little time 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.220
 we could see running games 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.800
 playstation 4 or xbox on a phone 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.510
 mobile so as not to get lost in the 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.940
 figures we have left you the 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.160
 complete specifications in the link of 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.770
 the description but we will highlight some 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.740
 for example say that the tegra x 1 is a 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.750
 64 bit processor of is core and 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.910
 built in 20 nanometer processes 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.680
 what does this mean, it's good that your 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.960
 energy efficiency in relation to 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.710
 power is better than processors 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.500
 what 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.870
 and a half so far another thing 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.910
 interesting is that nvidia makes the leap to 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.580
 the architecture more than the chip is 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.310
 compatible with graphic technologies such as 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:51.250
 could a open that will tell you that 12 also 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.580
 with engines like in a real engine 4 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.290
 little to say about this processor 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.900
 moment we do not know when it will reach 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.940
 form market installed within 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.670
 mobile but yes we have certain 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.160
 indications that nvidia could announce 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.710
 during this year a new console like 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.140
 envy chill where would show good 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.900
 well the possibilities the functions of 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.060
 the nvidia tegra x 1 that you think already 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.220
 you know that you can know more details 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.200
 concrete and specifications in the link 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.570
 of the description to finish os 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.190
 we want to talk about a company that good 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.900
 that goes free that is not in 3 of 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.390
 las vegas but that could surprise 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.260
 much within the universe of 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.510
 portable 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.940
 We are talking about a story that publishes the 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.490
 portal mind to find mack and that gives us 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.980
 an idea of what apple will present in 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.510
 within its macbook air range during 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.850
 2015 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.310
 night to fight max posted a post 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:48.760
 that in which shows a concept of 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.530
 new macbook the retina 112 a terminal 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.330
 what is expected for this year what 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.730
 interesting is that it would come with great 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.650
 changes at the design level to start 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:59.290
 well, it would be much more compact than 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.060
 current macbook air as it would reduce the 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.180
 space between the keys or that the 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.500
 keyboard would get more to the edges 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.050
 making better use of the surface in 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.060
 which is but without doubt the data 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.640
 What else has caught our attention is 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.710
 that apple would completely eliminate all 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.320
 the physical connections that it has 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:20.440
 currently the macbook air in exchange for 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.660
 a single port a port that would be usb 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.700
 of type c you already know this one that is 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.890
 reversible but the best part is that 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.810
 has some features that would allow 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.390
 that for example only with that port 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.970
 we could load the laptop in addition to 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:36.580
 connect any peripheral type 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.860
 usb and you wonder how we would do that 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.140
 well nothing through a very adapter 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.720
 tiny that apple would include with the 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:46.090
 12 inch macbook and retina 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.380
 overprices and releases there is nothing 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.690
 still simply 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.580
 we know this that you think is good 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.920
 you know that you can consult all the 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:57.120
 details of this news in the link of 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.120
