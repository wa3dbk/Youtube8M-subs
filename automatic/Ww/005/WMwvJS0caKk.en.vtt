00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.850
 It is the blue of the em-auto that we are indebted to 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.480
 This time Maserati's a 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:19.880
 Clock Digital Clock and Analog Clock 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.880
 I will explain how to repair the symptom that the time of this is gone 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.170
 Normally 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.340
 Here 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:34.250
 Digital clock is displayed and yes 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:36.610
 An analog clock unique to Maserati is here 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.930
 a is attached 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:46.570
 Well this digital watch and analog watch 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:53.050
 Basically, if you adjust this digital watch, this analog watch will 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:53.950
 It seems to be able to be adjusted to move to 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.630
 there is 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:01.370
 It is how to cure in that case 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:04.840
 Is the cure on how it will be as correct by adjusting the actual analog clock 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.840
 Let's actually go 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:14.280
 At first we will be in the state of a key on 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.570
 In this state 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.570
 And in this state 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:25.350
 9 ceilings 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.350
 This room lamp button 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:37.490
 First of all, the driver 's side reading light from the left 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:41.530
 Room lamp and there are three and a reading lamp on the passenger side, but this press reading lamp of the left and right length 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.530
 We will make Nagao small for over 10 seconds 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:50.600
 When it is pressed, the momentary reading light is turned on, but when using the length, this is 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.820
 Begins to flash 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:01.260
 Yes if this mode 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:06.950
 If it is blinking like this, it will be in the adjustment mode of the clock 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.950
 So how do you make adjustments? This button and this button 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.850
 This left and right 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:19.370
 Use this button to adjust 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:23.890
 I saw later When you also return to the original more than you are 10 seconds of inactivity 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.890
 Press and hold this for more than 10 seconds 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.209
 Just press one here was Mashi Mitsuki entered 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:46.190
 When you press left, the clock advances and the right 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:49.570
 Press the reading light 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.570
 The clock returns 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:57.540
 This middle button in the end if you fit it to the place of your thoughts 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.270
 When you press this 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:06.790
 Adjustment is finished 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:14.019
 The digital meter here by adjusting by pressing the button of the left and right 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:18.159
 The clock times listed and here's a good analog meter analog watch 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:21.060
 The clock on the left and right should you match the time 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:27.120
 Can be put together 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:29.989
 This concludes the description of how to make Maserati's watch work 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.989
 Thank you very much
