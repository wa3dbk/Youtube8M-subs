be able to make a very simple die set

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:51.850 
be able to make a very simple die set
for<00:00:50.570> the<00:00:50.690> air<00:00:50.839> hammer<00:00:51.080> that<00:00:51.379> would<00:00:51.500> accomplish

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
for the air hammer that would accomplish

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.610 
for the air hammer that would accomplish
this<00:00:52.339> now<00:00:52.839> this<00:00:53.839> is<00:00:53.900> a<00:00:54.940> coherent<00:00:55.940> die<00:00:56.620> an

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
this now this is a coherent die an

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.380 
this now this is a coherent die an
incoherent<00:00:58.400> die<00:01:00.370> is<00:01:01.370> like<00:01:01.729> the<00:01:01.970> ones<00:01:02.210> that

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
incoherent die is like the ones that

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.649 
incoherent die is like the ones that
we've<00:01:02.690> used<00:01:03.100> so<00:01:04.100> far<00:01:04.460> that<00:01:04.940> stretch<00:01:05.330> in<00:01:05.570> a

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
we've used so far that stretch in a

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.320 
we've used so far that stretch in a
radial<00:01:06.140> pattern<00:01:06.710> it<00:01:07.549> could<00:01:07.820> be<00:01:08.030> called<00:01:08.210> a

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
radial pattern it could be called a

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.280 
radial pattern it could be called a
radial<00:01:08.810> die<00:01:09.020> they<00:01:09.320> stretch<00:01:09.650> in<00:01:09.920> 360<00:01:10.729> degrees

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
radial die they stretch in 360 degrees

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.840 
radial die they stretch in 360 degrees
this<00:01:12.290> is<00:01:12.500> a<00:01:12.530> coherent<00:01:13.130> die<00:01:13.280> and<00:01:13.490> it<00:01:13.580> stretches

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
this is a coherent die and it stretches

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
this is a coherent die and it stretches
in<00:01:14.119> 180<00:01:14.659> degrees<00:01:16.090> so<00:01:17.090> if<00:01:17.240> we<00:01:17.420> were<00:01:17.540> to<00:01:17.659> have<00:01:17.810> a

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 
in 180 degrees so if we were to have a

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.870 
in 180 degrees so if we were to have a
flange<00:01:18.290> like<00:01:18.770> this<00:01:19.040> it<00:01:19.250> would<00:01:19.370> stretch<00:01:19.670> it

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
flange like this it would stretch it

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.270 
flange like this it would stretch it
only<00:01:20.300> along<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:20.630> length<00:01:20.990> of<00:01:21.230> the<00:01:21.320> flange<00:01:21.650> if

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
only along the length of the flange if

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.790 
only along the length of the flange if
you<00:01:22.670> hold<00:01:22.910> it<00:01:23.060> properly<00:01:23.600> in<00:01:23.900> the<00:01:24.020> machine<00:01:24.410> if

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
you hold it properly in the machine if

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.890 
you hold it properly in the machine if
you<00:01:25.040> if<00:01:25.670> you<00:01:25.940> turn<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:26.690> this<00:01:27.320> flange

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
you if you turn the this flange

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.970 
you if you turn the this flange
inappropriately<00:01:29.900> to<00:01:30.080> the<00:01:30.290> die<00:01:30.440> then<00:01:30.830> you're

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:30.980 
inappropriately to the die then you're

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.380 
inappropriately to the die then you're
gonna<00:01:31.100> goof<00:01:31.370> yourself<00:01:31.820> up<00:01:32.030> you're<00:01:32.210> going<00:01:32.330> to

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
gonna goof yourself up you're going to

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.540 
gonna goof yourself up you're going to
work<00:01:32.570> against<00:01:33.050> yourself<00:01:33.470> so<00:01:34.220> for<00:01:34.400> that<00:01:34.490> reason

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
work against yourself so for that reason

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.330 
work against yourself so for that reason
the<00:01:35.060> die<00:01:35.270> has<00:01:35.630> to<00:01:35.780> be<00:01:35.930> oriented<00:01:36.560> properly<00:01:36.890> in

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
the die has to be oriented properly in

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.400 
the die has to be oriented properly in
the<00:01:37.400> machine<00:01:37.730> at<00:01:37.910> all<00:01:38.000> times<00:01:38.330> now<00:01:39.200> I've<00:01:39.380> used

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
the machine at all times now I've used

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.020 
the machine at all times now I've used
it<00:01:39.770> a<00:01:39.800> bunch<00:01:40.010> of<00:01:40.160> different<00:01:40.460> fastening

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
it a bunch of different fastening

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.180 
it a bunch of different fastening
systems<00:01:41.480> for<00:01:41.750> this<00:01:41.900> and<00:01:42.170> I<00:01:42.260> discovered<00:01:43.010> this

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
systems for this and I discovered this

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.050 
systems for this and I discovered this
this<00:01:43.760> revolutionary<00:01:45.280> fastening<00:01:46.280> technology

just<00:02:05.930> a<00:02:06.050> little<00:02:06.080> bit<00:02:06.820> like<00:02:07.820> we<00:02:08.000> did<00:02:08.179> before<00:02:08.330> we

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
just a little bit like we did before we

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.979 
just a little bit like we did before we
set<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.500> air<00:02:10.220> unit<00:02:10.640> down<00:02:10.849> tight<00:02:11.209> now<00:02:11.569> this<00:02:11.810> is

the the metal does work harden over a
period<00:02:49.880> of<00:02:50.090> time<00:02:51.010> so<00:02:52.010> this<00:02:52.250> is<00:02:52.430> about<00:02:52.670> set<00:02:53.090> and

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
period of time so this is about set and

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.300 
period of time so this is about set and
I'll<00:02:53.360> go<00:02:53.570> through<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:53.960> drill<00:02:54.200> with<00:02:54.470> the<00:02:54.710> width

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
I'll go through the drill with the width

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.040 
I'll go through the drill with the width
setting<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:55.790> air<00:02:55.970> and<00:02:56.180> everything<00:02:56.420> after<00:02:56.990> I

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
setting the air and everything after I

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:18.490 
setting the air and everything after I
get<00:02:57.200> my<00:02:57.350> Mickey<00:02:57.560> Mouse<00:02:57.800> ears<00:02:58.010> on

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
my goal here was was actually to go

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.140 
my goal here was was actually to go
twice<00:03:22.470> around<00:03:22.860> if<00:03:23.099> I<00:03:23.220> could<00:03:23.520> it<00:03:23.790> didn't<00:03:24.030> work

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
twice around if I could it didn't work

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.470 
twice around if I could it didn't work
out<00:03:24.360> that<00:03:24.630> way<00:03:25.010> what<00:03:26.010> I<00:03:26.040> can<00:03:26.310> do<00:03:26.459> now<00:03:26.640> is<00:03:26.670> trim

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
out that way what I can do now is trim

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.870 
out that way what I can do now is trim
it<00:03:27.630> and<00:03:27.780> what<00:03:28.170> I've<00:03:28.319> got<00:03:28.560> is<00:03:28.860> a<00:03:28.890> is<00:03:29.370> a<00:03:29.430> flange

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
it and what I've got is a is a flange

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.690 
it and what I've got is a is a flange
for<00:03:30.420> a<00:03:30.450> duct<00:03:31.080> coming<00:03:31.590> off<00:03:31.739> of<00:03:31.770> a<00:03:31.980> bulkhead<00:03:32.280> for

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.280 
instance or a firewall and you'll
discover<00:03:35.760> it's<00:03:36.060> faster<00:03:36.480> to<00:03:36.600> make<00:03:36.720> it<00:03:36.780> this<00:03:37.050> way

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
discover it's faster to make it this way

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.440 
discover it's faster to make it this way
and<00:03:37.620> weld<00:03:37.860> it<00:03:38.010> a<00:03:38.100> rivet<00:03:38.400> it<00:03:38.550> than<00:03:38.730> it<00:03:38.850> is<00:03:38.880> a<00:03:39.030> lot

of other ways if you have the flange
curving<00:03:42.600> die<00:03:42.840> that's<00:03:43.410> what<00:03:43.560> this<00:03:43.860> is<00:03:43.920> called

the curving die for flanges and now
we'll<00:03:50.190> get<00:03:50.340> into<00:03:50.580> making<00:03:51.000> fairings<00:03:51.720> this<00:03:51.900> is

we'll get into making fairings this is

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.380 
we'll get into making fairings this is
the<00:03:52.200> first<00:03:52.440> step<00:03:52.709> in<00:03:52.980> making<00:03:53.130> reverses<00:03:54.090> or
