00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
on this particular vehicle I already

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.509 
on this particular vehicle I already
took<00:00:03.540> the<00:00:03.600> trim<00:00:03.959> out<00:00:04.310> it<00:00:05.310> just<00:00:05.520> pops<00:00:05.790> out<00:00:07.519> the

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
took the trim out it just pops out the

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.640 
took the trim out it just pops out the
radio<00:00:08.910> plays<00:00:09.269> at<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.750> pry<00:00:10.080> it<00:00:10.139> out<00:00:10.349> carefully

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
radio plays at the pry it out carefully

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.120 
radio plays at the pry it out carefully
and<00:00:12.290> this<00:00:13.290> cover<00:00:13.620> there's<00:00:14.040> little<00:00:14.280> Clips<00:00:14.670> here

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:16.130 
and this cover there's little Clips here

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.370 
and this cover there's little Clips here
you<00:00:17.130> just<00:00:17.279> pop<00:00:17.580> it<00:00:17.609> out<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.240> then<00:00:19.080> for<00:00:19.320> the

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
you just pop it out and then for the

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.160 
you just pop it out and then for the
cylinder<00:00:19.830> is<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:19.980> little<00:00:20.250> cover<00:00:20.869> little<00:00:21.869> screw

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
cylinder is a little cover little screw

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.730 
cylinder is a little cover little screw
underneath<00:00:23.119> this<00:00:24.119> is<00:00:24.359> real<00:00:24.570> easy<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:25.109> do<00:00:27.740> what

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
underneath this is real easy to do what

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.299 
underneath this is real easy to do what
you<00:00:28.890> get<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.189> little<00:00:29.550> tool<00:00:31.730> like<00:00:32.730> like<00:00:33.420> this

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
you get is a little tool like like this

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:36.979 
you get is a little tool like like this
and<00:00:35.309> on<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.670> bottom<00:00:36.059> underneath<00:00:36.450> there's<00:00:36.870> a

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
and on the bottom underneath there's a

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.670 
and on the bottom underneath there's a
little<00:00:37.290> hole<00:00:38.750> you<00:00:39.750> stick<00:00:40.110> this<00:00:40.230> under<00:00:40.410> the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
little hole you stick this under the

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.860 
little hole you stick this under the
hole<00:00:40.890> we<00:00:41.219> put<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.520> key<00:00:41.730> in<00:00:41.940> turn<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.420> key<00:00:42.660> and

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
hole we put the key in turn the key and

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.880 
hole we put the key in turn the key and
it<00:00:43.020> pops<00:00:43.290> right<00:00:43.530> out<00:00:45.079> but<00:00:46.079> this<00:00:46.410> was<00:00:46.559> calling

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
it pops right out but this was calling

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.330 
it pops right out but this was calling
it<00:00:47.010> causing<00:00:47.460> an<00:00:47.550> electrical<00:00:47.640> drawl<00:00:49.219> so<00:00:50.219> what

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
it causing an electrical drawl so what

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.560 
it causing an electrical drawl so what
I'm<00:00:50.399> going<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.550> do<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.760> pop<00:00:50.940> out<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.210> cylinder

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
I'm going to do is pop out the cylinder

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.080 
I'm going to do is pop out the cylinder
and<00:00:52.440> I'm<00:00:53.039> going<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.190> change<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.550> switch<00:00:53.850> which

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
and I'm going to change the switch which

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.110 
and I'm going to change the switch which
is<00:00:54.120> behind<00:00:54.510> there<00:00:55.399> but<00:00:56.399> this<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.730> really<00:00:56.910> easy

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
is behind there but this is really easy

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.849 
is behind there but this is really easy
to<00:00:57.180> get<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.390> cylinder<00:00:57.899> out<00:00:57.960> we'll<00:00:58.500> show<00:00:58.829> you

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
to get the cylinder out we'll show you

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.229 
to get the cylinder out we'll show you
that<00:01:00.500> all<00:01:01.500> right<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:02.010> very<00:01:02.340> simple<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:02.940> put<00:01:03.149> the

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
that all right is very simple I put the

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.780 
that all right is very simple I put the
tin

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.960 

could<00:01:06.270> disconnect<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.840> battery

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
could disconnect the battery

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:24.570 
could disconnect the battery
underneath<00:01:09.970> here<00:01:10.330> a<00:01:12.870> little<00:01:13.870> hole

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.590 

push<00:01:25.580> up<00:01:25.790> on<00:01:26.000> it<00:01:26.030> turn<00:01:26.330> the<00:01:26.360> key<00:01:26.630> and<00:01:28.420> slide<00:01:29.420> the

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
push up on it turn the key and slide the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.820 
push up on it turn the key and slide the
cylinder<00:01:29.960> out<00:01:32.050> it's<00:01:33.050> that<00:01:33.200> simple

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.100 

so<00:01:37.430> when<00:01:38.270> I<00:01:38.300> put<00:01:38.600> this

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
so when I put this

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.630 
so when I put this
under<00:01:41.110> here<00:01:41.290> went<00:01:41.500> through<00:01:41.680> the<00:01:41.800> sleeve<00:01:42.190> I

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
under here went through the sleeve I

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.450 
under here went through the sleeve I
basically<00:01:43.420> press<00:01:43.690> that<00:01:43.900> button<00:01:44.430> slid<00:01:45.430> right

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
basically press that button slid right

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.840 
basically press that button slid right
out<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:47.560> that's<00:01:47.740> pretty<00:01:48.220> much<00:01:48.400> how<00:01:48.550> to<00:01:48.580> change

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
out and that's pretty much how to change

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.200 
out and that's pretty much how to change
the<00:01:48.970> lock<00:01:49.090> solar<00:01:50.370> very<00:01:51.370> easy<00:01:51.640> but<00:01:51.910> now<00:01:52.090> I'm

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
the lock solar very easy but now I'm

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.760 
the lock solar very easy but now I'm
going<00:01:52.360> to<00:01:52.450> go<00:01:52.570> in<00:01:52.750> here<00:01:52.930> further<00:01:53.260> and<00:01:53.560> change

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
going to go in here further and change

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.430 
going to go in here further and change
the<00:01:53.979> switch<00:01:57.510> because<00:01:58.510> I<00:01:58.690> believe<00:01:59.050> that<00:01:59.080> was

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
the switch because I believe that was

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.090 
the switch because I believe that was
causing<00:01:59.740> an<00:01:59.979> electrical<00:02:00.550> charge<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.770> here's

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
causing an electrical charge and here's

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.880 
causing an electrical charge and here's
a<00:02:03.160> switch<00:02:03.520> it's<00:02:03.670> just<00:02:03.880> basically<00:02:04.890> screwing

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
a switch it's just basically screwing

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.440 
a switch it's just basically screwing
the<00:02:06.040> bolt<00:02:06.280> in<00:02:06.430> there<00:02:08.850> taking<00:02:09.850> a<00:02:10.000> sleeve<00:02:10.240> out

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
the bolt in there taking a sleeve out

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.390 
the bolt in there taking a sleeve out
putting<00:02:10.990> this<00:02:11.080> switching<00:02:11.590> flipping<00:02:12.130> it<00:02:12.250> in

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
putting this switching flipping it in

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.390 
putting this switching flipping it in
putting<00:02:12.820> everything<00:02:13.000> back<00:02:13.770> sliding<00:02:14.770> cylinder

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
putting everything back sliding cylinder

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.850 
putting everything back sliding cylinder
back<00:02:15.989> we're<00:02:16.989> going<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.200> see<00:02:17.350> if<00:02:17.470> it's<00:02:17.650> this

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
back we're going to see if it's this

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.490 
back we're going to see if it's this
part<00:02:18.130> first<00:02:18.430> closing<00:02:18.880> a<00:02:19.120> problem<00:02:19.930> because<00:02:20.290> it

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
part first closing a problem because it

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.880 
part first closing a problem because it
is<00:02:20.530> a<00:02:20.620> switch<00:02:21.989> if<00:02:22.989> that<00:02:23.170> doesn't<00:02:23.470> take<00:02:23.590> care<00:02:23.650> of

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
is a switch if that doesn't take care of

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.750 
is a switch if that doesn't take care of
it<00:02:24.040> or<00:02:24.130> not<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.310> change<00:02:24.520> the<00:02:24.670> cylinder<00:02:26.760> felt

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
it or not to change the cylinder felt

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.190 
it or not to change the cylinder felt
like<00:02:27.880> this<00:02:28.030> was<00:02:28.180> sticking<00:02:28.450> here<00:02:28.780> a<00:02:28.840> little<00:02:29.020> bit

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
like this was sticking here a little bit

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.979 
like this was sticking here a little bit
closing<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.709> jewel<00:02:29.980> so<00:02:30.220> that<00:02:30.370> could<00:02:30.550> be<00:02:30.989> this

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
closing the jewel so that could be this

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.870 
closing the jewel so that could be this
could<00:02:32.230> be<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.500> problem<00:02:32.920> it's<00:02:33.070> more<00:02:33.520> likely<00:02:33.730> a

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
could be the problem it's more likely a

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.960 
could be the problem it's more likely a
switch<00:02:34.239> so<00:02:34.390> we're<00:02:34.480> going<00:02:34.600> to<00:02:34.660> try<00:02:34.810> that<00:02:34.959> first

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
switch so we're going to try that first

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.180 
switch so we're going to try that first
and<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.060> core<00:02:37.239> can<00:02:37.510> be<00:02:37.540> started<00:02:37.980> or<00:02:38.980> put

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
and the core can be started or put

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.729 
and the core can be started or put
pliers<00:02:39.459> are<00:02:39.760> now<00:02:40.080> turning<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.290> rod<00:02:41.500> that

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
pliers are now turning the rod that

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:47.920 
pliers are now turning the rod that
slides<00:02:42.100> it<00:02:42.310> through<00:02:42.550> here

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:56.020 

Oh
