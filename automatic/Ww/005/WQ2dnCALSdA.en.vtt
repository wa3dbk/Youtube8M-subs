that<00:05:11.330> Dwight<00:05:12.200> Howard<00:05:12.500> all<00:05:12.620> defensive<00:05:14.620> like<00:05:15.620> I

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
that Dwight Howard all defensive like I

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.380 
that Dwight Howard all defensive like I
think<00:05:16.010> our<00:05:16.130> team<00:05:16.310> is<00:05:16.370> like<00:05:16.730> looking<00:05:16.910> at<00:05:17.120> look

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.390 
think our team is like looking at look

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.050 
think our team is like looking at look
at<00:05:17.450> that<00:05:17.510> coach<00:05:18.160> look<00:05:19.160> at<00:05:19.250> that<00:05:19.340> coach<00:05:19.610> three

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
at that coach look at that coach three

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.750 
at that coach look at that coach three
years<00:05:20.270> in<00:05:20.420> a<00:05:20.480> row<00:05:20.660> I<00:05:21.100> think<00:05:22.100> he'd<00:05:22.280> still<00:05:22.610> be

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
years in a row I think he'd still be

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.030 
years in a row I think he'd still be
wanted<00:05:23.030> even<00:05:23.510> if<00:05:23.630> I<00:05:23.720> kept<00:05:23.900> swimming<00:05:24.170> he'd

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 
wanted even if I kept swimming he'd

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.370 
wanted even if I kept swimming he'd
still<00:05:25.490> be<00:05:25.670> winning<00:05:26.000> it<00:05:26.150> all<00:05:26.300> because<00:05:26.870> he's<00:05:27.170> the

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
still be winning it all because he's the

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.410 
still be winning it all because he's the
man<00:05:27.680> I<00:05:27.980> don't<00:05:28.430> know<00:05:28.610> I<00:05:28.670> really<00:05:29.090> like<00:05:29.270> that

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:29.420 
man I don't know I really like that

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.360 
man I don't know I really like that
coach<00:05:29.720> even<00:05:30.050> though<00:05:30.170> the<00:05:30.920> coach<00:05:31.130> doesn't

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
coach even though the coach doesn't

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.370 
coach even though the coach doesn't
really<00:05:31.730> do<00:05:31.910> anything<00:05:32.150> but<00:05:32.330> he<00:05:32.690> got<00:05:32.870> to<00:05:33.110> be<00:05:33.350> a

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
really do anything but he got to be a

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.530 
really do anything but he got to be a
really<00:05:33.680> good<00:05:33.800> really<00:05:34.700> good<00:05:34.820> coach<00:05:35.240> and<00:05:35.420> he

defense<00:05:38.540> i'm<00:05:38.920> pretty<00:05:39.920> sure<00:05:40.040> that's<00:05:40.190> what

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
defense i'm pretty sure that's what

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.740 
defense i'm pretty sure that's what
happens<00:05:40.790> when<00:05:40.970> you<00:05:41.150> have<00:05:41.300> a<00:05:41.330> really<00:05:41.600> good

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
happens when you have a really good

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.740 
happens when you have a really good
coach<00:05:42.220> boosh<00:05:43.220> off<00:05:43.460> and<00:05:43.730> some<00:05:43.940> defense<00:05:44.510> and

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
coach boosh off and some defense and

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.580 
coach boosh off and some defense and
stuff<00:05:45.080> makes<00:05:45.980> right<00:05:46.460> calls<00:05:46.820> so<00:05:47.330> I'm<00:05:48.230> happy

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
stuff makes right calls so I'm happy

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.520 
stuff makes right calls so I'm happy
with<00:05:48.710> that<00:05:48.850> first<00:05:49.850> year<00:05:50.120> ever<00:05:50.240> I<00:05:50.630> think<00:05:50.900> Kobe

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
with that first year ever I think Kobe

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.730 
with that first year ever I think Kobe
Bryant<00:05:51.560> actually<00:05:52.490> retires<00:05:53.500> usually<00:05:54.500> Kobe

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
Bryant actually retires usually Kobe

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.310 
Bryant actually retires usually Kobe
Bryant<00:05:55.040> doesn't<00:05:55.280> tire<00:05:55.520> usually<00:05:55.880> there's<00:05:56.060> like

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
Bryant doesn't tire usually there's like

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.750 
Bryant doesn't tire usually there's like
Vince<00:05:57.320> Carter<00:05:57.770> than<00:05:57.890> them<00:05:58.010> in<00:05:58.160> there<00:05:58.310> but<00:05:58.520> he's
