00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
because you can actually rotate that

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.100 
because you can actually rotate that
knot<00:02:58.510> to<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.320> back<00:02:59.620> of<00:02:59.800> that<00:02:59.860> eyelet<00:03:00.490> and

knot to the back of that eyelet and

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.640 
knot to the back of that eyelet and
it'll<00:03:02.110> tend<00:03:02.410> to<00:03:02.470> hang<00:03:02.650> a<00:03:02.680> little<00:03:02.800> bit<00:03:03.010> more

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
it'll tend to hang a little bit more

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.720 
it'll tend to hang a little bit more
oh no<00:03:03.909> this<00:03:04.909> is<00:03:05.090> a<00:03:05.120> small<00:03:05.510> spoon<00:03:05.959> and<00:03:06.730> quite

oh no this is a small spoon and quite
often<00:03:07.939> the<00:03:08.810> fish<00:03:09.019> won't<00:03:10.010> bite<00:03:10.340> this<00:03:10.610> but<00:03:11.450> they

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
often the fish won't bite this but they

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.100 
often the fish won't bite this but they
see<00:03:11.870> this<00:03:12.230> bright<00:03:12.560> flashy<00:03:12.980> object<00:03:13.989> jigging<00:03:14.989> up

and<00:03:15.290> down<00:03:15.819> and<00:03:16.819> a<00:03:16.939> lot<00:03:17.090> of<00:03:17.150> times<00:03:17.360> it'll

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 
and down and a lot of times it'll

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.890

attract<00:03:17.900> fish<00:03:18.170> in<00:03:18.379> to<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:19.489> area<00:03:19.819> and<00:03:20.060> then<00:03:20.870> you

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
attract fish in to the area and then you

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.440 
attract fish in to the area and then you
can<00:03:21.230> oftentimes<00:03:21.590> get<00:03:22.129> them<00:03:22.250> to<00:03:22.430> bite<00:03:22.609> on<00:03:22.909> some

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450

what depth these fish are hanging at
quite<00:04:10.340> often<00:04:10.549> you'll<00:04:10.940> find<00:04:10.970> these<00:04:11.299> lake<00:04:11.540> trout

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
quite often you'll find these lake trout

in<00:04:12.220> 20<00:04:13.220> to<00:04:13.400> 60<00:04:13.819> foot<00:04:14.000> of<00:04:14.120> water<00:04:14.500> today<00:04:15.500> we're

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859 
in 20 to 60 foot of water today we're

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.729 
in 20 to 60 foot of water today we're
finding<00:04:16.280> them<00:04:16.459> out<00:04:16.639> in<00:04:17.359> 107<00:04:18.289> foot<00:04:18.500> of<00:04:18.590> water

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
kind of suspended off the bottom if we

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.390 
kind of suspended off the bottom if we
were<00:04:21.109> fishing<00:04:21.349> on<00:04:21.560> the<00:04:21.709> bottom<00:04:22.010> we'd<00:04:22.190> probably

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
were fishing on the bottom we'd probably

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.120 
were fishing on the bottom we'd probably
catch<00:04:22.760> a<00:04:22.880> few<00:04:23.060> fish<00:04:23.289> but<00:04:24.289> this<00:04:24.440> sonar<00:04:24.860> unit

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
catch a few fish but this sonar unit

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.730 
catch a few fish but this sonar unit
really<00:04:25.460> helps<00:04:25.909> us<00:04:26.090> be<00:04:26.659> able<00:04:26.690> to<00:04:27.110> see<00:04:27.409> where

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
really helps us be able to see where

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.830 
really helps us be able to see where
those<00:04:28.010> fish<00:04:28.250> are<00:04:28.400> hanging<00:04:28.789> out<00:04:28.940> and<00:04:29.150> we<00:04:29.659> can

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
those fish are hanging out and we can

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.379 
those fish are hanging out and we can
adjust<00:04:30.199> our<00:04:30.289> presentation<00:04:31.039> so<00:04:31.250> that<00:04:31.430> we<00:04:31.580> are

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
adjust our presentation so that we are

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.540 
adjust our presentation so that we are
exactly<00:04:32.780> where<00:04:32.990> the<00:04:33.229> fish<00:04:33.440> want<00:04:33.710> to<00:04:33.830> be<00:04:33.979> rather

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
exactly where the fish want to be rather

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.040 
exactly where the fish want to be rather
than<00:04:34.789> having<00:04:34.970> to<00:04:35.150> convince<00:04:35.510> them<00:04:35.750> to<00:04:35.780> go

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
than having to convince them to go

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.110 
than having to convince them to go
somewhere<00:04:36.260> else<00:04:36.650> to<00:04:37.639> catch<00:04:37.789> them

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
somewhere else to catch them

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.990 
somewhere else to catch them
so<00:04:38.270> really<00:04:38.900> helps<00:04:39.169> out<00:04:39.380> they<00:04:40.250> do<00:04:40.310> cost<00:04:40.760> a

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
so really helps out they do cost a

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.180 
so really helps out they do cost a
little<00:04:41.120> bit<00:04:41.300> of<00:04:41.510> money<00:04:41.659> but<00:04:41.960> they<00:04:42.770> certainly

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
little bit of money but they certainly

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.810 
little bit of money but they certainly
can<00:04:43.639> be<00:04:44.180> well<00:04:44.360> worth<00:04:44.599> it<00:04:45.039> structure<00:04:46.039> is<00:04:46.250> one<00:04:46.729> of

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
can be well worth it structure is one of

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.060 
can be well worth it structure is one of
the<00:04:46.880> most<00:04:47.060> important<00:04:47.570> things<00:04:47.870> when<00:04:48.710> it<00:04:48.830> comes

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
the most important things when it comes

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.460 
the most important things when it comes
to<00:04:49.340> to<00:04:49.760> lake<00:04:49.940> trout<00:04:50.180> fishing

to to lake trout fishing

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.640 
to to lake trout fishing
quite<00:04:52.070> often<00:04:52.280> they'll<00:04:52.669> relate<00:04:53.240> to<00:04:53.960> certain

what I like to do is quickly kill it so
that<00:06:51.190> it<00:06:51.250> doesn't<00:06:51.580> build<00:06:51.700> lactic<00:06:52.150> acid<00:06:52.570> up<00:06:52.720> in

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:52.870 
that it doesn't build lactic acid up in

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.659 
that it doesn't build lactic acid up in
its<00:06:53.020> muscles<00:06:53.470> it<00:06:53.650> tends<00:06:53.950> to<00:06:54.130> taste<00:06:54.370> better

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:54.669

its muscles it tends to taste better
that<00:06:54.910> way<00:06:55.090> way<00:06:55.750> I<00:06:55.780> do<00:06:55.930> that<00:06:56.260> is<00:06:56.470> they<00:06:56.620> take<00:06:56.830> the

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:57.820 
that way way I do that is they take the

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.940 
that way way I do that is they take the
sharp<00:06:58.120> side<00:06:58.360> of<00:06:58.540> this<00:06:58.720> ice<00:06:59.050> scoop<00:06:59.470> and<00:06:59.680> I<00:06:59.740> just

00:06:59.940 --> 00:06:59.950 
sharp side of this ice scoop and I just

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:01.710 
sharp side of this ice scoop and I just
hit<00:07:00.100> it<00:07:00.130> right<00:07:00.250> behind<00:07:00.580> this<00:07:00.910> goal<00:07:01.210> and

hit it right behind this goal and

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.719 
hit it right behind this goal and
that'll<00:07:01.990> separate<00:07:02.410> the<00:07:02.680> spine<00:07:03.220> there<00:07:03.520> and

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:03.729 
that'll separate the spine there and

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:05.580 
that'll separate the spine there and
they'll<00:07:03.850> kill<00:07:04.450> that<00:07:04.630> fish<00:07:04.840> roll<00:07:05.080> in<00:07:05.229> real

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:05.590 
they'll kill that fish roll in real

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:13.370 
they'll kill that fish roll in real
