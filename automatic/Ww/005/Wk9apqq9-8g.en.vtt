first of all animation is beautiful and
it<00:00:49.739> was<00:00:49.770> just<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.190> much<00:00:50.370> more<00:00:50.430> what<00:00:51.120> pokemon

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
it was just so much more what pokemon

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.000 
it was just so much more what pokemon
should<00:00:51.870> have<00:00:51.989> been<00:00:52.170> than<00:00:52.620> what<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.890> ultimately

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
should have been than what it ultimately

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.150 
should have been than what it ultimately
was<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.719> main<00:00:54.899> protagonist<00:00:55.170> red<00:00:55.860> and

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
normal tone you know shoot but it would

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.650 
normal tone you know shoot but it would
not<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.429> I<00:02:08.459> got<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.700> kick<00:02:08.910> out<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.270> she<00:02:09.450> does

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.180 
not so I got a kick out of that she does
do<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:09.899> slightly<00:02:10.229> different<00:02:10.440> performance<00:02:11.039> it's

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
do a slightly different performance it's

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.700 
do a slightly different performance it's
at<00:02:11.430> times<00:02:11.760> not<00:02:11.940> even<00:02:12.000> notice<00:02:12.480> of

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
at times not even notice of

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.230 
at times not even notice of
that<00:02:13.130> you<00:02:13.340> know<00:02:13.430> she<00:02:13.550> plays<00:02:13.790> normal<00:02:14.090> tone

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
that you know she plays normal tone

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.880 
that you know she plays normal tone
whatnot<00:02:14.540> but<00:02:14.690> her<00:02:15.080> performance<00:02:15.620> was<00:02:15.740> just

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
whatnot but her performance was just

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.130 
whatnot but her performance was just
solid<00:02:16.130> and<00:02:16.460> even<00:02:17.000> small<00:02:17.540> things<00:02:17.570> in<00:02:18.050> these

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
solid and even small things in these

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.730 
solid and even small things in these
obas

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
obas

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.530 
obas
just<00:02:19.040> made<00:02:19.190> it<00:02:19.340> seem<00:02:19.490> more<00:02:19.730> graphic<00:02:20.270> and<00:02:20.360> more

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
just made it seem more graphic and more

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.140 
just made it seem more graphic and more
violent<00:02:21.050> than<00:02:21.320> Pokemon<00:02:22.220> that<00:02:22.340> we<00:02:22.490> know<00:02:22.700> like

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
violent than Pokemon that we know like

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.820 
violent than Pokemon that we know like
when<00:02:23.330> squirtle<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:23.930> Charmander<00:02:24.500> are<00:02:24.620> going

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
when squirtle and Charmander are going

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.470 
when squirtle and Charmander are going
at<00:02:25.010> it<00:02:25.040> in<00:02:25.280> their<00:02:25.400> fight<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:25.850> I<00:02:26.150> believe<00:02:26.390> this

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
at it in their fight and I believe this

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.850 
at it in their fight and I believe this
was<00:02:26.690> the<00:02:26.720> first<00:02:27.020> OVA<00:02:27.640> it<00:02:28.640> was<00:02:28.820> just<00:02:29.030> like<00:02:29.150> yo

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
was the first OVA it was just like yo

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.410 
was the first OVA it was just like yo
when<00:02:30.860> squirtle<00:02:31.280> was<00:02:31.400> on<00:02:31.550> top<00:02:31.760> of<00:02:31.910> Charmander

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
when squirtle was on top of Charmander

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.030 
when squirtle was on top of Charmander
biting<00:02:32.870> him<00:02:33.080> Charmander<00:02:33.710> is<00:02:33.770> just<00:02:33.920> like

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
biting him Charmander is just like

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.190 
biting him Charmander is just like
screaming<00:02:34.610> and<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:34.880> the<00:02:35.360> screeches<00:02:36.050> and

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
screaming and the the screeches and

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.870 
screaming and the the screeches and
whatnot<00:02:36.470> just<00:02:36.500> all<00:02:36.920> managed<00:02:37.400> this<00:02:37.490> makes<00:02:37.730> it

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
whatnot just all managed this makes it

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.390 
whatnot just all managed this makes it
feel<00:02:38.030> so<00:02:38.060> much<00:02:38.450> more<00:02:38.560> realer<00:02:39.560> than<00:02:39.770> Pokemon

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
feel so much more realer than Pokemon

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.370 
feel so much more realer than Pokemon
ever<00:02:40.550> did<00:02:40.820> it<00:02:40.970> is<00:02:41.090> more<00:02:41.390> mature<00:02:41.630> just<00:02:42.170> more

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
ever did it is more mature just more

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.380 
ever did it is more mature just more
more<00:02:43.100> better<00:02:43.520> I<00:02:43.610> guess<00:02:43.910> you<00:02:44.030> could<00:02:44.150> say<00:02:44.180> in

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
more better I guess you could say in

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.610 
more better I guess you could say in
every<00:02:44.570> which<00:02:44.720> way<00:02:44.750> I<00:02:44.930> felt<00:02:45.200> as<00:02:45.320> though<00:02:45.350> these

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
every which way I felt as though these

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.770 
every which way I felt as though these
four<00:02:46.190> obas<00:02:46.610> have<00:02:46.850> literally<00:02:47.120> just<00:02:47.360> shitted<00:02:47.690> on

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
four obas have literally just shitted on

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.020 
four obas have literally just shitted on
like<00:02:47.960> the<00:02:48.200> past<00:02:48.440> decade<00:02:48.950> or<00:02:49.130> more<00:02:49.160> of<00:02:49.520> Pokemon

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
like the past decade or more of Pokemon

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.030 
like the past decade or more of Pokemon
and<00:02:50.210> what<00:02:50.540> it's<00:02:50.660> become<00:02:50.990> because<00:02:51.260> it's<00:02:51.800> no

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
it's pretty much just a glorified

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.610 
it's pretty much just a glorified
