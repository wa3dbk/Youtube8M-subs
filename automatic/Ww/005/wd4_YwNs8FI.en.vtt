what we were doing we were looking for a

what we were doing we were looking for a
very<00:00:14.120> unique<00:00:14.540> style<00:00:14.840> of<00:00:15.019> movement<00:00:15.560> and<00:00:15.920> we

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
very unique style of movement and we

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.500 
very unique style of movement and we
start<00:00:16.310> looking<00:00:16.460> at<00:00:16.670> martial<00:00:17.119> arts<00:00:17.360> in<00:00:17.480> the

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
start looking at martial arts in the

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.330 
start looking at martial arts in the
world<00:00:17.600> and<00:00:17.960> happily<00:00:18.290> arrow<00:00:18.470> is<00:00:18.740> really<00:00:19.160> the

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340 
world and happily arrow is really the

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.490 
world and happily arrow is really the
closest<00:00:20.060> that<00:00:20.660> we<00:00:20.810> could<00:00:20.990> come<00:00:21.260> to<00:00:21.470> that

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
closest that we could come to that

again<00:00:26.450> pepper<00:00:26.810> is<00:00:27.110> very<00:00:27.169> much<00:00:27.770> about<00:00:28.099> fluidity

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
again pepper is very much about fluidity

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.190 
again pepper is very much about fluidity
of<00:00:28.790> movement<00:00:28.880> and<00:00:29.630> perpetual<00:00:30.349> movement<00:00:32.200> we

of movement and perpetual movement we

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.350 
of movement and perpetual movement we
wanted<00:00:33.470> to<00:00:33.560> fuse<00:00:33.860> the<00:00:34.040> mobility<00:00:34.520> combine<00:00:35.030> the

looking at capoeira and freerunning made

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.360 
looking at capoeira and freerunning made
perfect<00:00:43.640> sense<00:00:44.379> one<00:00:45.379> of<00:00:45.500> the<00:00:45.559> key<00:00:45.739> mantris<00:00:46.190> for

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
perfect sense one of the key mantris for

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.740 
perfect sense one of the key mantris for
the<00:00:46.460> team<00:00:46.640> as<00:00:46.820> we<00:00:46.969> were<00:00:47.090> moving<00:00:47.269> through<00:00:47.629> this

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
the team as we were moving through this

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.079 
the team as we were moving through this
process<00:00:47.989> was<00:00:48.500> mobility<00:00:49.010> is<00:00:49.160> life<00:00:49.370> so

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.089 
process was mobility is life so

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:51.639 
process was mobility is life so
everything<00:00:50.539> we've<00:00:50.660> created<00:00:50.899> in<00:00:51.289> the<00:00:51.410> world

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
everything we've created in the world

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:53.829 
everything we've created in the world
actually<00:00:52.100> allows<00:00:52.339> us<00:00:52.370> to<00:00:52.640> live<00:00:53.179> that<00:00:53.359> man<00:00:53.629> for

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:53.839 
actually allows us to live that man for

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:55.779 
actually allows us to live that man for
day<00:00:54.019> and<00:00:54.170> day<00:00:54.289> out<00:00:54.320> you<00:00:54.769> run<00:00:54.949> on<00:00:55.100> walls<00:00:55.399> to<00:00:55.609> gain

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
day and day out you run on walls to gain

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.459 
day and day out you run on walls to gain
energy<00:00:56.030> to<00:00:56.359> keep<00:00:56.480> your<00:00:56.660> life<00:00:56.870> you<00:00:57.079> jump<00:00:57.350> over

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
energy to keep your life you jump over

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:59.290 
energy to keep your life you jump over
objects<00:00:58.129> to<00:00:58.249> give<00:00:58.370> you<00:00:58.489> energy<00:00:58.820> for<00:00:59.210> your

one<00:01:12.560> of<00:01:12.650> the<00:01:12.710> most<00:01:12.830> challenging<00:01:13.340> things<00:01:13.790> that

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
one of the most challenging things that

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.360 
one of the most challenging things that
we<00:01:14.060> came<00:01:14.210> across<00:01:14.450> was<00:01:14.810> our<00:01:15.050> first<00:01:15.350> light<00:01:15.950> cycle

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.370 
we came across was our first light cycle

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.120 
we came across was our first light cycle
experience<00:01:16.880> that<00:01:17.210> was<00:01:17.390> just<00:01:17.690> a<00:01:17.960> senior<00:01:18.740> pants

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
experience that was just a senior pants

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.530 
experience that was just a senior pants
experience<00:01:19.580> that<00:01:19.700> we<00:01:19.790> wanted<00:01:20.000> to<00:01:20.060> create<00:01:20.390> so

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
experience that we wanted to create so

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.120 
experience that we wanted to create so
lots<00:01:20.840> of<00:01:20.960> destruction<00:01:21.560> lots<00:01:21.740> of<00:01:21.890> stuff<00:01:22.100> going

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
lots of destruction lots of stuff going

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.500 
lots of destruction lots of stuff going
on

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
on

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.750 
on
it<00:01:24.050> cycles<00:01:24.440> the<00:01:24.560> biggest<00:01:24.920> change<00:01:25.190> for<00:01:25.370> them<00:01:25.550> is

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
it cycles the biggest change for them is

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.670 
it cycles the biggest change for them is
that<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:26.420> vehicle<00:01:26.570> is<00:01:26.870> much<00:01:27.080> more<00:01:27.200> updated<00:01:27.620> in

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
that the vehicle is much more updated in

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.380 
that the vehicle is much more updated in
terms<00:01:27.740> of<00:01:27.950> physics<00:01:28.280> you<00:01:28.460> could<00:01:28.940> potentially

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
terms of physics you could potentially

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.690 
terms of physics you could potentially
do<00:01:29.540> a<00:01:29.570> 180<00:01:29.900> and<00:01:30.410> you<00:01:31.160> can<00:01:31.280> throw<00:01:31.520> your

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
do a 180 and you can throw your

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.580 
do a 180 and you can throw your
lightness<00:01:32.060> from<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:32.330> light<00:01:32.450> cycle<00:01:32.840> so<00:01:33.470> we'll

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
lightness from the light cycle so we'll

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.590 
lightness from the light cycle so we'll
have<00:01:33.710> levels<00:01:34.100> we're<00:01:34.340> crazy<00:01:34.910> stuff<00:01:35.270> going<00:01:35.510> on

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
have levels we're crazy stuff going on

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.300 
have levels we're crazy stuff going on
buildings<00:01:36.110> following<00:01:36.530> things<00:01:36.740> exploding

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
buildings following things exploding

around<00:01:37.580> you<00:01:37.760> and<00:01:37.940> then<00:01:38.210> all<00:01:38.330> of<00:01:38.360> a<00:01:38.420> sudden

around you and then all of a sudden

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.940 
around you and then all of a sudden
you've<00:01:38.750> got<00:01:38.780> to<00:01:38.960> hop<00:01:39.080> into<00:01:39.260> a<00:01:39.350> light<00:01:39.560> tank<00:01:39.770> and

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
you've got to hop into a light tank and

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.030 
you've got to hop into a light tank and
it's<00:01:40.040> a<00:01:40.100> different<00:01:40.400> game<00:01:40.580> entirely<00:01:42.040> there's

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
it's a different game entirely there's

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.680 
it's a different game entirely there's
definitely<00:01:43.580> the<00:01:43.640> aggressive<00:01:44.030> way<00:01:44.150> to<00:01:44.210> go<00:01:44.420> you

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
definitely the aggressive way to go you

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.420 
definitely the aggressive way to go you
just<00:01:44.900> go<00:01:45.170> in<00:01:45.320> and<00:01:45.590> bulldoze<00:01:45.980> your<00:01:46.100> way<00:01:46.220> through

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
just go in and bulldoze your way through

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.810 
just go in and bulldoze your way through
with<00:01:46.610> your<00:01:46.700> light<00:01:46.910> disc<00:01:47.150> and<00:01:47.420> nothing<00:01:47.720> else

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
with your light disc and nothing else

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.340 
with your light disc and nothing else
you<00:01:49.820> can<00:01:49.970> play<00:01:50.180> more<00:01:50.450> defensive<00:01:51.020> and<00:01:51.170> really

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
you can play more defensive and really

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.930 
you can play more defensive and really
make<00:01:51.500> use<00:01:51.650> of<00:01:51.710> those<00:01:51.890> disk<00:01:52.160> powers<00:01:52.550> and<00:01:52.760> be

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
make use of those disk powers and be

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.790 
make use of those disk powers and be
more<00:01:53.090> strategic<00:01:53.660> or<00:01:53.840> you<00:01:54.440> can<00:01:54.560> do<00:01:54.770> a

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
more strategic or you can do a

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.550 
more strategic or you can do a
combination<00:01:55.130> of<00:01:55.430> both<00:01:55.750> each<00:01:56.750> vehicle<00:01:57.080> is<00:01:57.410> its

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
combination of both each vehicle is its

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.620 
combination of both each vehicle is its
own<00:01:57.740> game<00:01:57.979> it<00:01:58.280> impacts<00:01:58.640> us<00:01:58.820> on<00:01:58.970> how<00:01:59.120> we<00:01:59.150> create

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
own game it impacts us on how we create

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.420 
own game it impacts us on how we create
the<00:01:59.810> physics<00:02:00.200> representations<00:02:01.100> for<00:02:01.310> these

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
the physics representations for these

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.920 
the physics representations for these
different<00:02:01.760> vehicles<00:02:02.240> and<00:02:02.479> how<00:02:02.570> the<00:02:02.630> game

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
different vehicles and how the game

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.930 
different vehicles and how the game
designers<00:02:03.500> will<00:02:03.770> tune<00:02:04.070> those<00:02:04.310> vehicles<00:02:04.580> and

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
designers will tune those vehicles and

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.430 
designers will tune those vehicles and
make<00:02:05.060> sure<00:02:05.240> that<00:02:05.360> they<00:02:05.510> actually<00:02:05.660> behave<00:02:06.229> the

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
make sure that they actually behave the

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.250 
make sure that they actually behave the
way<00:02:06.560> that<00:02:06.590> we<00:02:06.800> want<00:02:07.010> them<00:02:07.160> to<00:02:07.370> I<00:02:08.110> think<00:02:09.110> we

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:09.260 
way that we want them to I think we

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.200 
way that we want them to I think we
realized<00:02:09.770> we<00:02:09.950> hit<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.280> sweet<00:02:10.490> spot<00:02:10.550> for<00:02:10.850> the

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
realized we hit the sweet spot for the

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.510 
realized we hit the sweet spot for the
high<00:02:11.390> mobility<00:02:11.540> combat<00:02:12.320> when<00:02:12.710> we've

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
high mobility combat when we've

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.100 
high mobility combat when we've
literally<00:02:13.850> picked<00:02:14.210> it<00:02:14.330> out<00:02:14.450> one<00:02:14.630> day<00:02:14.660> and<00:02:14.990> were

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
literally picked it out one day and were

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.560 
literally picked it out one day and were
like<00:02:15.320> wow<00:02:15.830> I<00:02:16.100> have<00:02:16.310> never<00:02:16.730> seen<00:02:17.030> this<00:02:17.209> done<00:02:17.390> in

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
like wow I have never seen this done in

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:26.050 
like wow I have never seen this done in
a<00:02:17.660> video<00:02:17.780> game<00:02:17.959> before

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.120
