00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.509
 hi greets you gustavo de cono print on 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.440
 this video 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:14.900
 I want to mention how to transport well 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:17.480
 your printer epson l 355 from a city to 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.180
 another usually when people want 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.940
 transport your printer does not know how 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.460
 do it and the indications given by the 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:28.580
 epson manual really are very 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.220
 constraints there are many things that the 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.840
 experience indicates should be made of 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.940
 another way seven printers is not 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.340
 initially hoisted that is to say that it is empty 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.460
 It's sealed package is no problem 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.800
 can transport it anywhere you want 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.960
 can be carried by plane by boat or 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.489
 cars there is no problem can 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.470
 transport freely 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.130
 then when you arrive at destination the only thing 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.930
 what do you have to do 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.510
 initialize step by step but if the 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:59.110
 ink tanks are full and the 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.570
 machine is working 100% and then from 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.940
 that they have to transport it to take it from 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.040
 one city to another considers these 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.100
 tips that will serve you much 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.979
 first close the tank valve one 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.580
 lever that the epsom manuals have 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:17.500
 mentioned and they say that you have to close it 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.780
 then with the small plugs in about 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.630
 small holes that each one has 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.580
 color places there a rubber that comes 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.370
 Inside the printer and sealed 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.180
 and then move the printer from a 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.620
 place to another and that 's where the good comes from 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.580
 move printer horizontally 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:40.130
 just as you use it on the desk 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:43.520
 It seems a lie but there are people who 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.640
 want to want what moves it vertical 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.030
 face up, legs up, etc. 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.710
 et cetera etcetera occur frequently 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.330
 in the transport cooperatives or 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.670
 when you get someone who 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.940
 transport the printer from a city to 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.490
 another is a pity there are many risks 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.950
 lethal to your machine if you do it 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.250
 this way so I recommend you that 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.979
 the transport horizontally such 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.100
 as if the one used enters into its 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.190
 good desktop according to the city of 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:20.090
 departure and destination city as each 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:22.459
 city has an altitude at sea level 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.180
 according to this altitude it may be that the 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:28.610
 ink tank is filled with pressure or it 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.709
 empty of pressure in any of the 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.700
 two cases the first thing that you have to 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.690
 do 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:38.569
 by flipping the tanks as if you were 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.730
 fill the inks remove the plugs 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.459
 big take out the small plugs 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:47.750
 put back the big plugs and there 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:51.200
 yes open the tank valve an error 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:54.200
 fatal would be that the first thing you do is 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.769
 open the tank valve do not do it 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.049
 The first thing you have to do is 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:02.480
 put the tanks off the plugs 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.720
 great take out the small plugs and 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.570
 then take out the havana 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.630
 and remember you have to simulate as if 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.730
 will fill the shelves in this way the 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:16.210
 tanks will acquire the pressure 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.030
 atmospheric of the site and will not harm your 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.340
 printer 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.190
 after doing what I tell you what 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.260
 you have to do is turn on the 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.060
 connect it and do one or two cleaning 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.220
 heads until the path 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.459
 stay well once the 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.260
 test to work was said so when 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.110
 move this printer from a city to 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.520
 another you know you're going to save your life 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.930

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:45.180

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.860
