00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:49.169 
used in that way and for me it's like

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:53.330 
used in that way and for me it's like
really<00:02:49.590> weird<00:02:49.919> because<00:02:50.189> I<00:02:50.599> mean<00:02:51.799> this<00:02:52.799> series

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
really weird because I mean this series

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.729 
really weird because I mean this series
so<00:02:53.549> far<00:02:53.909> has<00:02:54.209> been<00:02:54.239> like<00:02:54.689> giving<00:02:55.200> us<00:02:55.349> so<00:02:55.590> much

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
so far has been like giving us so much

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.759 
so far has been like giving us so much
assumptions<00:02:56.609> about<00:02:57.000> each<00:02:57.450> character<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:58.650> it

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
assumptions about each character and it

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.559 
assumptions about each character and it
doesn't<00:02:59.069> seem<00:02:59.189> to<00:02:59.250> be<00:02:59.459> fully<00:02:59.700> fleshed<00:03:00.090> out<00:03:00.359> it

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
doesn't seem to be fully fleshed out it

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.589 
doesn't seem to be fully fleshed out it
makes<00:03:00.750> sense<00:03:01.079> if<00:03:01.620> he<00:03:01.799> said<00:03:02.099> this<00:03:02.340> after<00:03:03.209> we

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
makes sense if he said this after we

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.869 
makes sense if he said this after we
have<00:03:03.629> a<00:03:03.750> flashback<00:03:04.379> of<00:03:04.409> him<00:03:04.760> experiencing<00:03:05.760> it

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
have a flashback of him experiencing it

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.839 
have a flashback of him experiencing it
firsthand<00:03:06.269> of<00:03:06.750> why<00:03:07.379> this<00:03:07.950> kind<00:03:08.189> of<00:03:08.280> situation

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
firsthand of why this kind of situation

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.629 
firsthand of why this kind of situation
is<00:03:08.970> really<00:03:09.209> horrible<00:03:09.419> or<00:03:09.840> bad<00:03:10.290> but<00:03:11.159> like<00:03:11.340> at

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:11.639 
is really horrible or bad but like at

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:14.240 
is really horrible or bad but like at
face<00:03:12.090> value<00:03:12.120> like<00:03:13.049> just<00:03:13.349> to<00:03:13.500> react<00:03:13.859> that<00:03:13.979> way

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
face value like just to react that way

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.610 
face value like just to react that way
all<00:03:14.549> of<00:03:14.669> a<00:03:14.760> sudden<00:03:15.120> it<00:03:15.569> makes<00:03:15.780> no<00:03:15.989> sense<00:03:16.349> I<00:03:16.530> mean

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
all of a sudden it makes no sense I mean

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.830 
all of a sudden it makes no sense I mean
we<00:03:16.859> need<00:03:17.010> we<00:03:17.430> need<00:03:17.459> literally<00:03:18.120> some<00:03:18.359> character

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:53.920 
series is going it seems to be like I

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.690

would<00:06:54.920> say<00:06:55.220> it's<00:06:55.580> getting<00:06:56.090> better<00:06:57.070> better<00:06:58.070> I

00:06:58.690 --> 00:06:58.700 
would say it's getting better better I

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.810

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:01.820 
think that very loosely because I mean

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.640 
think that very loosely because I mean
right<00:07:02.030> now<00:07:02.060> this<00:07:02.690> doesn't<00:07:02.750> really<00:07:03.380> have<00:07:03.620> much

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:03.650 
right now this doesn't really have much

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.790 
right now this doesn't really have much
of<00:07:04.040> of<00:07:04.700> of<00:07:05.060> a<00:07:05.210> fucking<00:07:05.630> bar<00:07:05.870> the<00:07:06.080> path<00:07:06.350> to<00:07:06.650> get

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:06.800 
of of of a fucking bar the path to get

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.150 
of of of a fucking bar the path to get
actually<00:07:07.160> get<00:07:07.280> better<00:07:08.260> but<00:07:09.260> it's<00:07:09.650> getting

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 
actually get better but it's getting

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.700 
actually get better but it's getting
better<00:07:10.400> especially<00:07:11.150> with<00:07:11.690> the<00:07:11.840> decapitation

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:12.710
