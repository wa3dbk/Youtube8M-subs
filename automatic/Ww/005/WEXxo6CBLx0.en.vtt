to<00:00:39.059> do<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.690> make<00:00:39.750> sure<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.379> sensor<00:00:40.770> has<00:00:40.920> a

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
to do is make sure the sensor has a

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.420 
to do is make sure the sensor has a
battery<00:00:41.989> it<00:00:42.989> uses<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.469> little<00:00:43.649> button<00:00:44.160> cell

how<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:47.850> will<00:00:48.300> laugh<00:00:48.570> if<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:49.020> fit<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.379> sensor

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
how you will laugh if you fit the sensor

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.979 
how you will laugh if you fit the sensor
in<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.010> frame<00:00:50.250> only<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.210> find<00:00:51.390> out<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.690> you

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
in the frame only to find out that you

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.840 
in the frame only to find out that you
should<00:00:52.170> have<00:00:52.289> put<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.440> battery<00:00:52.710> in<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.100> first<00:00:53.370> so

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
should have put a battery in it first so

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:02.330 
should have put a battery in it first so
check<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:56.449> next<00:00:57.449> remove<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.079> bank<00:01:00.920> to<00:01:01.920> do<00:01:02.070> this
