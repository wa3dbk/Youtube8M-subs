00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.930
 there are numbers in some 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.129
 research indicating that the Flemish have 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.240
 more fans in brazil than the 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:15.219
 corinthians 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.670
 great to have no problem and even 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:20.349
 it exists because it is the northeast 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.170
 mainly for many years 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.699
 many years only football is seen 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.920
 I think on TV 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:27.760
 helped to raise too much come the fans 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.890
 from Flemish 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.550
 the radio comes from the radio 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.500
 river is then this huge 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.350
 mass of fans formed and Flemish 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.010
 generally fills stadium even wherever 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.339
 that go 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.620
 - on the river the crazy 60 did not play calmly 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:46.979
 Flemish played in the Carioca championship 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.930
 had the game in Argentina we stayed 

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:51.820
 domed wave with 300 and few people 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:56.049
 do not see how much the madureira with how many 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:58.629
 people there a dreadful deal this is me 

00:00:56.049 --> 00:01:01.989
 people hate the background corinthians 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.979
 my heart is never going to happen 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.420
 what will happen to the 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:06.970
 corinthians corinthians do not play no 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.950
 play for less 5 10 thousand people 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.710
 But it's okay so that does not mean 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.600
 I 'm not hierarchical here. 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.770
 who is better worse the crowd of 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.860
 Corinthians , in fact, she has a 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.420
 very characteristic of it 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.120
 that is genius points of people 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.480
 confuse here is cheer size with 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.730
 a flashy is what thinks the most 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.070
 fan fanatic of the team more little girl 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.930
 not want to drop the third well 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.000
 Portuguese fan is very fanatical 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.940
 It's because the team does not win it. 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.770
 there and I think the fans that go the most 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:43.750
 stadium is the sport crowd with this 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.020
 It's not cool, I thought it would. 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.610
 pluck no longer talking go hurt us 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.080
 the human nose 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.510
 corinthians fans are always 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.470
 crowding pacaembu will fill the quake 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.900
 human 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.370
 I totally agree, Ricardinho, it's not 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.409
 for us to fight against the numbers 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.479
 corinthians it proves by more b than 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.000
 has corinthians fan more fanatic 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.190
 year after year he has been showing 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.930
 presence of the public within the stadium is 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.369
 the corinthians who head people do not 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.709
 this is good discuss this 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.269
 and there's something she has not said 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.340
 really I think the following is santa 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.770
 personnel showing profit for example the 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.060
 of the most fanatic is not the greatest but the 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.130
 bulky this is the supporter 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.230
 of what goes though his team does not 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.390
 conquer anything then with Brazil 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.160
 there pellets in the classic Wild Card 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.690
 Brazil even in the last of his does not win 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.209
 nothing today he's always there to cheer 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.800
 small but fanatical today is the passion of 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:38.390
 supporter was on the plate 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.620
 So that kind of thing is what it is. 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.720
 because it's bigger 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.450
 fanaticism is a tomorrow size thing 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.800
 will be from other areas and he will today 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.690
 that the corinthians in the championship 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.220
 paulista did not always end is the 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.549
 the highest average of the championship 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.730
 beautiful medium against and not you did not read 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:57.830
 This is a mistake for 15,000 people from 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.959
 will do this while doing my best 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.680
 You better tell me it was Flemish. 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:07.400
 and imaginable see the corinthians play 300 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.349
 people have one thing that I think is 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.209
 more reasonable to imagine a fan of 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:14.959
 for example wanting to hit a 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:17.090
 player who has had has kept us 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.190
 saw with the present since the Flemish 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.230
 also entered the spot in the final ever 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:25.940
 arrived at that point states I think this 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:28.579
 one of the fans often do not 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.480
 fan asks why someone someone has 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:31.880
 its time 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.519
 no no it was even the staff of the 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.930
 Flemish people with yourself dance lives 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.299
 dating Flemish turns and moves are 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.880
 dating personal series does not invade 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.799
 in the debate on the flamenco 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.079
 not invade to see paper I think it's going to be 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:47.690
 the gávea five mortars whose center 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:50.239
 was the goalkeeper Julius Caesar did not 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.280
 They failed to remember the lesson just call 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:59.389
 the main camera here is to observe the 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:04:01.450
 inform that this is it stating that 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:06.290
 Your mother who is a fan or fans 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:09.410
 invade she is equal to fans and vacancy 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.700
 in protest and throw bombs at the 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:15.680
 flamengo player 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:18.260
 just waiting for a good so sat jacks 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.359
 about the safety of the water in the mouth 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.310
 so it 's a race is not an issue 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.070
 It's not only the Corinthians, I did not tell 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.600
 you beckham 16 hours when the fans 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.610
 There are fans already 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.530
 All fans in Brazil have fans. 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.140
 corinthians idiots have flamengo 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.889
 has São Paulo has the year of the church tried 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.810
 liked 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:37.939
 all the fans have this type of 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.699
 fan is not a privilege of anyone not 

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:43.759
 it's a privilege nobody or not at 2 o'clock 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:45.979
 the eca is more 80 catch of risk of the 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:47.900
 five other ten Brazilian chairs the 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:50.659
 committee is always ahead I am 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.060
 we do not make the blind 

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:55.039
 you not only in the south the Corinthian is more 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.219
 violent with its symbols of which I think 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:05:00.620
 that's the same for them all are 

00:04:58.219 --> 00:05:02.840
 Renato approval is the same thing some 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.969
 thing about schools relation time to people 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.800
 respect you cut without stopping but all 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:09.110
 tie the corinthians crowd 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.419
 the point that she is often fanatical 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.729
 She loses her head, too, like Pedro. 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:16.189
 luciano then take thrashing of the saints 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:18.469
 in Belmiro village for 5 to 1 three days 

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:20.199
 after they invaded the ct she loses 

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:22.069
 reason too, bro 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:24.409
 Ricardinho in relation to this episode 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:26.150
 fans suddenly not all cheering 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:28.159
 have these bad elements that he does not give 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.960
 to talk is more bandit that is less 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:32.449
 bandit everyone is bandit 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.520
 There is a scale where there is this one is more 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:36.020
 violent I think the bandit supporter 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.240
 there is any place in any 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.069
 twisted in any type of hit in 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.849
 that behind the bars the fan who 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:43.069
 does not work 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:45.520
 the place of a bum in jail in the 

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:45.520
 Stadium
