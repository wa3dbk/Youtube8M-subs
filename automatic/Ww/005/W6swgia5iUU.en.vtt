00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:11.309
 good morning, you, my name is salt and 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.780
 I'm from the ali anesthesia department 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.780
 as a mule in germany 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.980
 there are problems with a catheter and the 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.380
 anesthetist doctor ali deals with the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.750
 patient 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.179
 In addition to anesthesia prepare the 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.989
 operation and inform the patient form 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:28.989
 part of their tasks 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.100
 when you do a good job does not matter 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:43.010
 from wherever and the color of your skin this 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:44.950
 it's really like that and it's understood without 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.890
 problems 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:51.190
 the doctor holds her up to read 42 years 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.290
 comes from Syria is one of the many 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.300
 foreign doctors in a clinic 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:59.350
 true jewelry where half of the 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:02.230
 Doctors does not have a German passport 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.049
 and I have been in Germany one year and eight months 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.360
 at first it was difficult to get along with 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.880
 patients with colleagues but little 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.470
 to little works the sick have 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.220
 patience and if they do not understand something 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.220
 they ask 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.439
 that parent comes from the part 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.390
 Syrian Kurd ran away with her family from the 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:24.549
 war in your home the big city of 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.670
 alepo to the little jewel is true in 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:29.560
 saxony doctor ali could never the 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.780
 imagine that it would end here in a place 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.409
 known in Germany for his riots 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.409
 racists 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:43.220
 before you know it had not heard 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.140
 that and I have had no problems everything has 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.270
 worked well with working with the 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.760
 neighbors until now everything works 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.180
 superbly without problems I did not know 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.330
 nothing and when he read what happened here that 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.450
 he thought then 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.140
 that was 20 years ago and it surely was 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.140
 other people 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.409
 already find 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.830
 true jewelry the name of the city is 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.070
 closely linked in germany to autumn 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.470
 from 91 when a racist horde was 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:22.030
 for days and nights the residences of 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.030
 refugees and foreign workers 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.819
 the far right is still strong in 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.790
 the region and the neo-Nazi party has 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:34.900
 councilors although only 1% of the 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.900
 inhabitants are foreigners 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.160
 true jewelry is a complicated place what 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.830
 know the clinic boss andreas 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.870
 grassmann in neighboring countries has searched 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.660
 staff offering a good training 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.550
 and offer leisure in the region as they are 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.560
 few doctors who voluntarily 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.560
 opt for the provincial Saxony 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.370
 we could not count on our 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.470
 foreign doctors this hospital would have 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.420
 ceased to exist as a central point of 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.110
 patient care and as a clinic 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.110
 permanent attention 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.140
 the clinic supports doctors 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.180
 foreigners doctor ali was lucky 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.160
 that the boss will bet on him since 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.600
 Job applications from Syria 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.600
 they are extremely complex 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.530
 the permission to exercise was complicated 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.930
 it was difficult to accept his 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.180
 medical leave all the paperwork took 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.940
 a lot of time at the end he started working 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.890
 with us on August 6, 2012 le 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.630
 keep the square as much as I could because 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.260
 I realized that he deserved a 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.260
 opportunity 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.240
 the end reads seized the opportunity 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.790
 he is satisfied with his work in the 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.800
 clinic and life in rogers truth but 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.830
 he does not know if he will stay or by how much 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.830
 weather 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:01.400
 we do not know what the future will bring 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.650
 later in a big city or all 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.750
 life here I do not know we do not have either 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.240
 concrete plans 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.830
 without doctors like the doctor ali jewelry 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.830
 it would be poorer
