death on that side and yeah so the

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.530 
death on that side and yeah so the
complication<00:03:36.630> this<00:03:36.810> was<00:03:37.050> a<00:03:37.290> a<00:03:37.740> benign<00:03:38.130> tumor

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
complication this was a a benign tumor

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.480 
complication this was a a benign tumor
locally<00:03:39.540> invasive<00:03:40.140> did<00:03:40.380> not<00:03:40.620> metastasize

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
locally invasive did not metastasize

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.630 
locally invasive did not metastasize
that<00:03:41.730> grows<00:03:41.970> locally<00:03:42.210> until<00:03:42.720> it<00:03:42.870> you<00:03:43.620> know<00:03:43.680> you

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
that grows locally until it you know you

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.300 
that grows locally until it you know you
succumb<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.090> it<00:03:45.390> yes<00:03:45.800> so<00:03:46.800> this<00:03:47.040> could<00:03:47.280> be

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
succumb to it yes so this could be

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.770 
succumb to it yes so this could be

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
for years actually about three or four

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.330 
for years actually about three or four
years<00:04:00.990> of<00:04:01.080> watching<00:04:01.380> him<00:04:01.710> knowing<00:04:02.130> what<00:04:02.310> I

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
years of watching him knowing what I

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.100

knew<00:04:02.670> about<00:04:02.700> Western<00:04:03.330> medicine<00:04:03.810> and<00:04:03.990> then

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
knew about Western medicine and then

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.860
