lot of that work for you but how does it
all<00:00:55.680> work<00:00:55.980> well<00:00:56.910> like<00:00:57.329> traditional<00:00:57.809> animation

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140

Desperate Housewives at 9:00 I don't

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.910 
Desperate Housewives at 9:00 I don't
know<00:02:28.260> how<00:02:28.319> that<00:02:28.379> got<00:02:28.530> in<00:02:28.590> there

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
know how that got in there

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.860 
know how that got in there
that's<00:02:29.069> really<00:02:29.310> not<00:02:29.459> in<00:02:29.580> lying<00:02:29.730> I<00:02:29.819> swear<00:02:29.870> all

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
that's really not in lying I swear all

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.420 
that's really not in lying I swear all
right<00:02:30.989> well<00:02:31.319> the<00:02:31.410> point<00:02:31.650> is<00:02:31.769> that<00:02:31.950> keyframes

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
right well the point is that keyframes

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.009 
right well the point is that keyframes
tell<00:02:32.730> an<00:02:32.819> object<00:02:33.269> what<00:02:33.420> it<00:02:33.450> has<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:33.810> be<00:02:33.900> doing

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
tell an object what it has to be doing

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.620 
tell an object what it has to be doing
at<00:02:34.319> a<00:02:34.349> specific<00:02:34.650> time<00:02:35.069> so<00:02:35.519> for<00:02:35.760> example<00:02:36.239> you

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
at a specific time so for example you

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.050 
at a specific time so for example you
may<00:02:36.810> set<00:02:37.080> it<00:02:37.200> up<00:02:37.349> so<00:02:37.530> that<00:02:37.560> first<00:02:38.099> some<00:02:38.550> text<00:02:38.910> is

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
may set it up so that first some text is

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.759 
may set it up so that first some text is
at<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.330> bottom<00:02:39.660> of<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.870> screen<00:02:40.110> and<00:02:40.410> small

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
at the bottom of the screen and small

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.009 
at the bottom of the screen and small
but<00:02:41.310> at<00:02:41.430> a<00:02:41.459> few<00:02:41.790> seconds<00:02:42.180> into<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.510> animation

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
but at a few seconds into the animation

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.080 
but at a few seconds into the animation
the<00:02:43.470> text<00:02:43.799> is<00:02:43.890> at<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.129> top<00:02:44.340> of<00:02:44.489> the<00:02:44.580> screen<00:02:44.879> and

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
the text is at the top of the screen and

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.449 
the text is at the top of the screen and
big<00:02:45.470> keyframes<00:02:46.470> tell<00:02:46.799> your<00:02:46.980> animation

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
big keyframes tell your animation

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.490 
big keyframes tell your animation
program<00:02:47.849> the<00:02:48.060> exact<00:02:48.480> timing<00:02:48.810> for<00:02:49.110> each<00:02:49.319> of

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
program the exact timing for each of

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.530 
program the exact timing for each of
those<00:02:49.650> events<00:02:49.860> what<00:02:50.730> happens<00:02:51.060> between<00:02:51.269> the

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
those events what happens between the

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.780 
those events what happens between the
keyframes<00:02:51.840> is<00:02:52.349> calculated<00:02:53.040> by<00:02:53.160> your<00:02:53.310> computer

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
keyframes is calculated by your computer

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.759 
keyframes is calculated by your computer
so<00:02:54.060> you<00:02:54.090> don't<00:02:54.299> have<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.569> do<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.810> work<00:02:54.989> but

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
so you don't have to do the work but

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.220 
so you don't have to do the work but
that<00:02:55.950> said<00:02:56.310> just<00:02:57.090> because<00:02:57.239> a<00:02:57.390> computer<00:02:57.720> does<00:02:58.019> a

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
that said just because a computer does a

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.050 
that said just because a computer does a
lot<00:02:58.470> of<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.620> work<00:02:58.769> for<00:02:59.040> you<00:02:59.220> doesn't<00:02:59.819> mean

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
lot of the work for you doesn't mean

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.089 
lot of the work for you doesn't mean
