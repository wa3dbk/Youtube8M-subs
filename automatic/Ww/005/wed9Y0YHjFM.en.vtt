dad's house since then when I was

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.890 
dad's house since then when I was
younger<00:00:14.730> I<00:00:14.969> used<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.179> go<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.360> my<00:00:15.480> dad's<00:00:15.660> house

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
younger I used to go to my dad's house

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.390 
younger I used to go to my dad's house
on<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.139> weekends<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:16.800> he<00:00:16.920> would<00:00:17.039> always<00:00:17.160> have

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
on the weekends and he would always have

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.660 
on the weekends and he would always have
something<00:00:17.609> for<00:00:17.850> me<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.060> take<00:00:18.240> apart<00:00:18.570> like<00:00:19.199> old

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
something for me to take apart like old

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.880 
something for me to take apart like old
electronics<00:00:20.670> or<00:00:21.000> just<00:00:21.480> anything<00:00:22.170> metal<00:00:22.410> for

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
electronics or just anything metal for

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.400 
electronics or just anything metal for
the<00:00:23.010> scrap<00:00:23.279> metal<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.789> he'd<00:00:24.539> let<00:00:24.720> me<00:00:24.750> take<00:00:25.019> the

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
the scrap metal and he'd let me take the

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.500 
the scrap metal and he'd let me take the
thing<00:00:25.590> apart<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.849> lot<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.090> stuff<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.330> got<00:00:27.480> to

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
thing apart and a lot of stuff I got to

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.169 
thing apart and a lot of stuff I got to
keep<00:00:27.779> just<00:00:28.109> because<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.529> wasn't<00:00:28.890> worth

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:29.179 
keep just because it wasn't worth

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.569 
keep just because it wasn't worth
scrapping<00:00:30.199> so<00:00:31.199> that's<00:00:31.980> how<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.130> learned<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.489> lot

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
scrapping so that's how I learned a lot

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.380 
scrapping so that's how I learned a lot
of<00:00:32.640> my<00:00:32.759> electronics<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.680> mechanical

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
of my electronics and the mechanical

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.400 
of my electronics and the mechanical
knowledge<00:00:36.390> was<00:00:36.600> just<00:00:36.840> from<00:00:36.989> taking<00:00:37.290> things

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
knowledge was just from taking things

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.299 
knowledge was just from taking things
apart<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:39.050> so<00:00:40.050> when<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.559> would<00:00:40.710> go<00:00:40.800> over<00:00:40.829> there

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
apart and so when I would go over there

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.240 
apart and so when I would go over there
I<00:00:41.520> would<00:00:42.300> be<00:00:42.660> working<00:00:43.020> on<00:00:43.140> my<00:00:43.230> desk<00:00:43.500> in<00:00:43.860> my<00:00:43.890> room

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
I would be working on my desk in my room

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.580 
I would be working on my desk in my room
and<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.820> set<00:00:45.059> this<00:00:45.149> up<00:00:45.270> as<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.450> security<00:00:46.289> camera

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
and I set this up as a security camera

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.619 
and I set this up as a security camera
and<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:47.399> is<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.640> TV<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.180> had<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.450> hooked

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
and this is the TV that I had it hooked

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.959 
and this is the TV that I had it hooked
up<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.809> because<00:00:49.800> he<00:00:50.010> would<00:00:50.129> like<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.399> sneak<00:00:50.670> in

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
up to because he would like to sneak in

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.139 
up to because he would like to sneak in
my<00:00:51.239> room<00:00:51.420> really<00:00:52.350> quietly<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.190> scare<00:00:53.789> me<00:00:53.969> by

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
you know going boo when I was working on

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.790 
you know going boo when I was working on
something<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.420> put<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.719> camera<00:00:57.930> hooked<00:00:58.680> it

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
something so I put the camera hooked it

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.410 
something so I put the camera hooked it
up<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.129> can<00:00:59.370> have<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.550> camera<00:00:59.820> facing<00:01:00.329> the

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
up so I can have a camera facing the

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.420 
up so I can have a camera facing the
door<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.230> could<00:01:01.379> see<00:01:01.500> on<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.710> TV<00:01:02.039> if<00:01:02.190> he<00:01:02.280> was

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
door and I could see on the TV if he was

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.899 
door and I could see on the TV if he was
coming<00:01:02.730> in<00:01:02.820> my<00:01:02.850> room<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.239> scare<00:01:03.539> me<00:01:03.920> but<00:01:04.920> just

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
take this stuff over to my new house and

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:14.300 
take this stuff over to my new house and
this<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:12.840> one<00:01:12.960> thing<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.290> decided<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.770> keep<00:01:14.010> I

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
this is one thing I decided to keep I

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.770 
this is one thing I decided to keep I
have<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.520> whole<00:01:14.729> box<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.119> other<00:01:15.270> stuff<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.570> I'm

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
have a whole box of other stuff that I'm

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.539 
have a whole box of other stuff that I'm
probably<00:01:15.900> going<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.200> take<00:01:16.350> apart<00:01:16.680> but<00:01:17.009> this

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
probably going to take apart but this

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.620 
probably going to take apart but this
one<00:01:17.729> still<00:01:17.880> works<00:01:18.240> this<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:20.240> code<00:01:21.240> i/o

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
one still works this is a code i/o

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
cleaned it up really well it's nice and

cleaned it up really well it's nice and
shiny

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:24.579 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:27.250 

it<00:02:25.579> has<00:02:25.730> auto<00:02:25.939> focus<00:02:26.329> which<00:02:26.540> is<00:02:26.569> really<00:02:26.840> nice

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
it has auto focus which is really nice

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.770 
it has auto focus which is really nice
good<00:02:27.560> look<00:02:27.650> at<00:02:27.739> the<00:02:27.799> front<00:02:28.010> here<00:02:28.599> we<00:02:29.599> got<00:02:29.750> a

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
good look at the front here we got a

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.289 
good look at the front here we got a
nice<00:02:29.930> big<00:02:29.959> lens<00:02:30.440> I<00:02:30.799> think<00:02:30.980> these<00:02:31.099> two<00:02:31.370> sensors

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
nice big lens I think these two sensors

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.440 
nice big lens I think these two sensors
have<00:02:32.480> to<00:02:32.599> do<00:02:32.659> with<00:02:32.750> autofocus<00:02:33.019> and<00:02:34.269> then<00:02:35.269> over

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
have to do with autofocus and then over

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:36.670 
have to do with autofocus and then over
here<00:02:35.480> is<00:02:35.720> where<00:02:35.870> your<00:02:35.959> battery<00:02:36.110> pack<00:02:36.260> would've

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
here is where your battery pack would've

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:43.420 
here is where your battery pack would've
gone<00:02:41.200> one<00:02:42.200> thing<00:02:42.349> that's<00:02:42.530> missing<00:02:42.650> on<00:02:43.099> this<00:02:43.250> is

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
gone one thing that's missing on this is

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.180 
gone one thing that's missing on this is
the<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:44.180> eyeball<00:02:44.720> viewfinder<00:02:45.409> I<00:02:45.590> probably

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
the the eyeball viewfinder I probably

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.670 
the the eyeball viewfinder I probably
took<00:02:46.430> it<00:02:46.489> off<00:02:46.700> and<00:02:46.940> used<00:02:47.120> it<00:02:47.299> as<00:02:47.450> a<00:02:47.959> little<00:02:48.290> TV

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
took it off and used it as a little TV

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.319 
took it off and used it as a little TV
when<00:02:48.859> I<00:02:48.890> was<00:02:49.069> younger<00:02:49.250> because<00:02:49.940> I'd<00:02:50.120> take

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
when I was younger because I'd take

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:51.640 
when I was younger because I'd take
things<00:02:50.510> apart<00:02:50.629> and<00:02:50.989> try<00:02:51.260> to<00:02:51.319> build<00:02:51.500> other

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
things apart and try to build other

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.550 
things apart and try to build other
things<00:02:52.000> but<00:02:53.000> I<00:02:53.389> kept<00:02:54.019> the<00:02:54.109> camera<00:02:54.409> just

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
things but I kept the camera just

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.170 
things but I kept the camera just
because<00:02:54.829> they<00:02:54.950> even<00:02:55.129> back<00:02:55.280> then<00:02:55.459> I<00:02:55.489> liked<00:02:55.819> it<00:02:56.000> I

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
because they even back then I liked it I

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.589 
because they even back then I liked it I
think<00:02:56.599> this<00:02:56.690> was<00:02:56.840> my<00:02:56.989> first<00:02:57.139> tube<00:02:57.470> type<00:02:57.709> camera

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
think this was my first tube type camera

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.449 
think this was my first tube type camera
and<00:02:59.599> I'm<00:02:59.690> glad<00:02:59.870> I<00:02:59.900> still<00:03:00.200> have<00:03:00.319> it<00:03:00.500> being<00:03:01.250> one

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
and I'm glad I still have it being one

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.670 
and I'm glad I still have it being one

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
of the first eight milliliters this here

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.500 
of the first eight milliliters this here
is<00:03:03.859> the<00:03:04.220> docking<00:03:04.639> station<00:03:05.090> you<00:03:07.389> put<00:03:08.389> your

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.490 
in there and then the little tape
