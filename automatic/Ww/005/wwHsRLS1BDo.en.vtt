00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 The last firefly is the first 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:08.040
 film by isao takahata alone studio 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.540
 ghibli the whole is based on a work 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.240
 one of the pass the second 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.670
 World War almost as experienced as the 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.949
 This is why mccreary is shown on film 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.080
 as a result that is a pretty 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.090
 serious work we come to plot that 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.130
 Japan of the second world war the 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.050
 landscapes and the everyday 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.869
 Situations are characterized by 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.970
 bomb attacks hunger grief and all 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.099
 these problems among the people 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.489
 Nevertheless, people try with all 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.140
 Our train saw the same way of survival 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.940
 as well as her mother we can do it 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.980
 actually quite good until one day the 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.360
 mother dies in a bomb attack 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.280
 First, the two 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.289
 siblings with relatives 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.239
 housed but that should turn out to be 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.120
 turn out to be an even bigger problem 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.600
 because you are rather annoyed and therefore 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.309
 are and they have fled 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.949
 because he thought so it is anyway 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.930
 easy for components we can do it 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.030
 not so much the longer you 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.760
 are living alone, the greater their 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.380
 problems hunger hunger both suffer 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.790
 Siblings are in the principle of bad luck 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.409
 followed and I think that's yes 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.729
 still some people watching the movie 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.590
 have not seen because I am now 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.750
 did not tell any more and wanted his 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.430
 not for the poland wants for the g still 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.619
 have not seen and see here that 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.509
 not only myself but also the ones 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.460
 other dimon studio ghibli work 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.100
 in principle a maximum effort 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.380
 give criticism to the society to practice 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.210
 Here he is again shown that the 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.130
 war is really bad it will be 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.630
 Much criticized it gets very serious 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.610
 disturbed the film works for me 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.049
 personally quite authentic and that 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.150
 is one of the reasons why he actually 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.159
 as good as she is so emotional 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.079
 why so moving is another reason 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.960
 it did not stand on the music 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.270
 as usual from tobias schiek but from 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.340
 missio mamma mia is the only power 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.110
 any orchestral songs what you are in 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.270
 Principle actually raushÃ¶rt find synonymous 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.520
 me personally and the tracks that the 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.290
 club plays under the anime are in 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.149
 principle very nicely done just that 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.840
 animations ago is the last 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.280
 firefly 588 well done for 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.710
 Nowadays you have to say that he 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.209
 definitely part 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.280
 so a bit weakens you 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.440
 then not expect too much 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.380
 I mean those who think that 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.810
 Here you are a high end class work 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.700
 expect of 1988 have become natural 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.500
 cut but I think so 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.300
 perfectly ok the project is such a retro 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.040
 charm on and also though the 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.900
 animations no longer the 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.030
 best of all are the film can be 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.250
 still wonderful and beautiful 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.050
 view conclusion by picking up one 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.370
 really bad topic namely the 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.840
 war directed agatha here is the well 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.370
 most emotional anime movie elements 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.570
 to create at all through the 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.640
 moving story of the two 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.070
 siblings gives the film a lot 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.320
 authenticity which is even more moving 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.000
 and saddened as the topic is 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.920
 anyway already believes next to these bad 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.950
 Bad moments are always in the movie 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.930
 always beautiful emotional 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.310
 positive situation and present the 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.739
 film itself is a really good one 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.660
 made drama is like frame should 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.760
 then readiness of the film music 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.160
 is it really nice there it is more so 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.350
 orchester sounds pastel and I think 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.000
 also a certain charm over it 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.890
 All in all, that's it 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.780
 really so that the movie is very dark 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.220
 works even though it is not dark 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.049
 just looks generally at this 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.390
 subject matter as I said with the war if 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.489
 has not yet seen and trimmed tender 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.840
 That should be the advantage of what 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.910
 be prepared for it is real 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.100
 dramatic if seen before 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.870
 I know what I mean and for all 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.250
 those who have already seen says 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.750
 Please give me your opinion is in 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.160
 I would be very interested in film and 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.690
 Of course, as always, everything is very important 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.070
 page is and remains my opinion if 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.390
 you do not like it then do it 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:42.070
 but quite simply a series of its own 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.070
 next video citigroup
