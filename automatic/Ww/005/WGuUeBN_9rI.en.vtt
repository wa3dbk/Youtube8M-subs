sunburst<00:00:06.750> effect<00:00:07.290> um<00:00:07.649> yep<00:00:08.429> let's<00:00:09.030> get<00:00:09.240> into<00:00:09.510> it

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:10.849 
sunburst effect um yep let's get into it

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:16.010 
sunburst effect um yep let's get into it
first<00:00:11.849> of<00:00:11.969> all<00:00:12.059> go<00:00:12.300> create<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:13.170> new<00:00:13.740> window<00:00:15.020> ctrl

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
first of all go create a new window ctrl

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.759 
first of all go create a new window ctrl
n<00:00:18.710> will<00:00:19.710> bring<00:00:20.039> up<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.400> new<00:00:20.430> window<00:00:20.880> you<00:00:21.769> can

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
n will bring up a new window you can

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.849 
n will bring up a new window you can
make<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.160> 800<00:00:23.820> by<00:00:24.029> 800<00:00:24.240> as<00:00:24.840> really<00:00:25.500> up<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.769> you

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
make it 800 by 800 as really up to you

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:32.389 
make it 800 by 800 as really up to you
the<00:00:26.039> size<00:00:27.289> yep<00:00:28.289> okay<00:00:28.949> okay<00:00:30.769> then<00:00:31.769> go<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.099> you

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
the size yep okay okay then go to you

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:41.930 
the size yep okay okay then go to you
color<00:00:33.120> right<00:00:33.840> here<00:00:36.829> select<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:39.200> black<00:00:40.940> color

selected and then what you need to do is

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.779 
selected and then what you need to do is
go<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.180> your<00:00:57.980> gradient<00:00:58.980> here<00:00:59.250> it's<00:00:59.489> not

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
go to your gradient here it's not

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.039 
go to your gradient here it's not
selected<00:01:00.649> click<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:02.039> then<00:01:02.910> select<00:01:03.149> gradient

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
selected click and then select gradient

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:12.130 
selected click and then select gradient
and<00:01:04.880> then<00:01:05.880> hold<00:01:06.710> shift<00:01:07.710> on<00:01:07.920> your<00:01:08.189> keyboard<00:01:08.250> and

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.850 

do<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.170> gradient<00:01:13.710> line<00:01:14.189> like<00:01:14.610> that

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
do a gradient line like that

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.510 
do a gradient line like that
and<00:01:17.060> you<00:01:18.060> should<00:01:18.270> get<00:01:18.540> um<00:01:19.070> something<00:01:20.070> similar

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
and you should get um something similar

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.940 
and you should get um something similar
to<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:21.619> and<00:01:22.619> then<00:01:24.380> what<00:01:25.380> you're<00:01:25.530> going<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.740> do

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
to this and then what you're going to do

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:33.219 
to this and then what you're going to do
next<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.970> go<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.450> filter<00:01:28.409> um<00:01:30.110> this<00:01:31.110> tool<00:01:31.500> and

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
next is go to filter um this tool and

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.830 
next is go to filter um this tool and
then<00:01:34.229> from<00:01:34.710> there<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.240> wave<00:01:38.000> from<00:01:39.000> here<00:01:39.030> mine's

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
then from there to wave from here mine's

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.690 
then from there to wave from here mine's
already<00:01:40.049> set<00:01:40.500> up<00:01:40.530> um<00:01:41.270> then<00:01:42.649> number<00:01:43.700> generators

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
already set up um then number generators

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.560 
already set up um then number generators
should<00:01:44.729> be<00:01:45.149> maintained<00:01:46.909> that<00:01:47.909> wavelength

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
should be maintained that wavelength

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.440 
should be maintained that wavelength
should<00:01:48.899> be<00:01:49.140> men<00:01:49.860> should<00:01:50.189> be<00:01:50.220> one<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.060> make

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
should be men should be one and make

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.780 
should be men should be one and make
should<00:01:51.780> be<00:01:52.369> 25<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.869> then<00:01:55.219> for<00:01:56.219> this<00:01:56.399> one<00:01:56.610> it

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
should be 25 and then for this one it

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.440 
should be 25 and then for this one it
should<00:01:56.969> be<00:01:57.030> one<00:01:57.420> in<00:01:57.600> 14<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:59.299> horizontal<00:02:00.299> and

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
should be one in 14 and horizontal and

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.370 
should be one in 14 and horizontal and
vertical<00:02:00.899> should<00:02:01.110> be<00:02:01.320> both<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.430> hundred<00:02:02.969> and

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
vertical should be both a hundred and

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.389 
vertical should be both a hundred and
down<00:02:04.380> here<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:05.009> should<00:02:05.310> be<00:02:05.659> repeat<00:02:06.659> on<00:02:06.960> each

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
down here it should be repeat on each

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.499 
down here it should be repeat on each
pixels<00:02:08.399> and

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
pixels and

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.949 
pixels and
the<00:02:09.840> type<00:02:10.140> should<00:02:10.500> be<00:02:11.480> this<00:02:12.480> one

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
the type should be this one

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.240 
the type should be this one
um<00:02:13.700> sin<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:15.420> then<00:02:16.049> once<00:02:16.349> you<00:02:16.470> got<00:02:16.650> that<00:02:16.860> go

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
um sin and then once you got that go

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.119 
um sin and then once you got that go
okay

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129 
okay

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:24.520 
okay
and<00:02:20.239> you<00:02:21.239> you<00:02:21.989> get<00:02:22.260> something<00:02:22.620> like<00:02:22.680> this<00:02:23.090> and

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
and you you get something like this and

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:31.240 
and you you get something like this and
then<00:02:25.910> go<00:02:26.910> to<00:02:26.970> filter<00:02:27.569> again<00:02:27.930> I<00:02:28.400> just<00:02:29.400> stood<00:02:29.640> and

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
then go to filter again I just stood and

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.000 
then go to filter again I just stood and
then<00:02:32.250> this<00:02:32.489> time<00:02:32.790> it'll<00:02:33.180> be<00:02:33.360> this<00:02:34.080> polar

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
then this time it'll be this polar

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:42.440 
then this time it'll be this polar
coordinate<00:02:35.849> and<00:02:38.420> don't<00:02:39.420> um<00:02:41.150> change<00:02:42.150> and

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
coordinate and don't um change and

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.020 
coordinate and don't um change and
change<00:02:43.019> anything<00:02:43.379> apart<00:02:44.099> from<00:02:44.220> Evitts

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
change anything apart from Evitts

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:51.670 
change anything apart from Evitts
on<00:02:47.299> rectangular<00:02:48.650> rectangular<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:50.310> polar<00:02:50.459> a

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
on rectangular rectangular to polar a

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.319 
on rectangular rectangular to polar a
rather<00:02:52.680> than<00:02:52.920> having<00:02:53.160> it<00:02:53.400> polar<00:02:53.760> to

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
rather than having it polar to

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:57.380 
rather than having it polar to
rectangular<00:02:54.930> so<00:02:55.290> just<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.769> top<00:02:56.069> one<00:02:56.129> then<00:02:57.090> go

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
rectangular so just the top one then go

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:03.170 
rectangular so just the top one then go
okay<00:02:58.220> now<00:02:59.220> you<00:02:59.280> get<00:02:59.640> this<00:02:59.849> um<00:03:00.180> nice<00:03:02.180> sunburst

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
okay now you get this um nice sunburst

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.569 
okay now you get this um nice sunburst
um<00:03:05.299> here<00:03:06.299> so<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:07.019> then<00:03:07.530> what<00:03:07.829> you<00:03:07.950> can<00:03:07.980> do<00:03:08.430> is

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
um here so and then what you can do is

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.410 
um here so and then what you can do is
if<00:03:08.730> you<00:03:08.819> want<00:03:09.060> to<00:03:09.180> put<00:03:09.359> on<00:03:09.599> something<00:03:09.930> on<00:03:10.650> a

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
if you want to put on something on a

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.650 
if you want to put on something on a
photo<00:03:12.560> logo<00:03:13.560> or<00:03:13.769> anything<00:03:14.099> I'll<00:03:15.000> just<00:03:15.060> show

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
photo logo or anything I'll just show

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.580 
photo logo or anything I'll just show
you<00:03:15.690> how<00:03:15.780> to<00:03:15.900> do<00:03:16.200> that

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
for example I want to put it on a maybe

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.199 
for example I want to put it on a maybe
a<00:03:21.440> control<00:03:22.440> Oh<00:03:22.680> to<00:03:22.769> open<00:03:23.639> and<00:03:23.910> then<00:03:24.120> I'll

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
a control Oh to open and then I'll
