00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:05.390
 No worries here I ask you Catena Rimpar Pieper who played completely 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.109
 Roel not quite as good overall 

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:13.639
 so i avoid so last 20 hours break with train and shovel 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:14.629
 and 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.890
 about three hours before splitting and pillory connecting flight Walser 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.199
 Stop Mr. Schulz with long hair said Franz 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.710
 if you have to feel but also cleaned up 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.929
 Kai Sponsors handle it very well 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:33.150
 at 10 o'clock the very own requirements Saturday so a 16 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.160
 Weinmann Euro per player where you want to play opportunities 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.250
 So area but because no one knows where I'm approaching 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.870
 as shrill as otherwise play 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.480
 on accordingly too 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.850
 Almost all of them lost to Kubik and I'm undermining one 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.700
 bad start also in the championship 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.870
 all lost and talk against Wetzlar Spanknebel 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.740
 Berlusconi 4 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.220
 against 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.600
 bring us after 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.239
 a normal good shape 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.710
 because I had a good chance so exemplary 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.080
 the ideas have to go that way 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.080
 Solms more 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.110
 Normally, I should say fifty-fifty 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.110
 and go around Elstal church heavily as rain 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.620
 You can also lose and have order 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.980
 but otherwise I am very dissatisfied in Munich first two clear I know 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.270
 very exactly what was maybe 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.260
 Jetlag or so Rolf Presse should not be such a bouquet 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.920
 Explanation 30 Rainer k lay many things 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.500
 Bes at the IMF as well as nothing together - Jürgen Stoffers will 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.220
 President Assad 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.320
 Toyota was Sunday 10th Championship Brad Pitt I played so I think 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.370
 I'm in top form 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.240
 then I fought my way to eleventh place 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.009
 Aabar place for me it was then more exciting 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.259
 That was also yesterday for Austria - if the water saved 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.890
 and I should have won 4 0 or 4 1 and look forward to it 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.240
 in front of that also clear that Brussels is abundant there is nothing 

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:14.079
 Val d'isere a strong player 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.219
 there was not much more to get 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:21.549
 So övp I have again played a measure normal form so not 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:27.189
 I have before me outstanding for my circumstances again who deep down 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:29.139
 All right 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:30.540
 and from there 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.570
 if I also hurry back the next event renovated equip it 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.810
 be sure to worry so what's going on Stocker's hand 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.459
 already fell significantly before the first game 

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:45.119
 So engagement as too bureaucratic 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.609
 Case 4 falls below 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:51.779
 Example to CEO of Protestes what my work 

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:55.599
 and then I think morning at six or seven o'clock as well as tumors 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.379
 Fliers back 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:58.739
 and 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.069
 The next week often do not work so Stuttgarter can 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.499
 not always been so scholik 

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:08.759
 Wanted to see much praise for the PEH 5 or seven died 

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:10.709
 Problem is, I'm sorry 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:11.510
 not that either 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.889
 but first pierce Grande from Art 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:15.029
 but 

00:03:15.029 --> 00:03:18.389
 next week, what I do best is the 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.689
 other major countries 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:24.019
 Shortly thereafter, the Ems of upcoming games I see that he plays 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.019
 in front and go fast mostly fell off 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:32.349
 and I think that Kutzner celebrates the success of the sheikh or more 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.109
 First place 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:35.220
 to Korea 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.699
 take care to play the final I hope so 

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:41.699
 I can then deliver good results and 

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:43.379
 police report 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:45.439
 if the event is here 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:48.719
 Of course the Windows 7 is beautiful from Lotte are Allnet and im 

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:51.719
 e-paper from many windows 

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:55.959
 yes but I want to quickly Eichler reliable Pfeiler songs recorded 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:56.799
 Has 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.799
 soon to the server my worst performance 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:04.369
 Coupons orchestra together 

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:06.669
 I hope it is not worth it and 1 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:09.669
 Retrieving bad performance may take the next few weeks 

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:12.089
 then it is too 

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:15.319
 Protestsongs Greetings from Tannheim and basically
