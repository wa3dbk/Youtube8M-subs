then you take the white Q that is the UK
to<00:04:07.260> just<00:04:07.560> light<00:04:07.770> up<00:04:07.800> the<00:04:08.100> China<00:04:08.430> now<00:04:09.260> here<00:04:10.260> I

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
to just light up the China now here I

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:16.820 
to just light up the China now here I
have<00:04:10.440> a<00:04:10.760> true<00:04:11.760> dark<00:04:12.060> green<00:04:12.450> screen<00:04:15.830> the

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
have a true dark green screen the

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.470 
have a true dark green screen the
version<00:04:17.250> 3.0<00:04:17.850> with<00:04:18.090> an<00:04:18.270> IQ<00:04:18.690> I<00:04:19.320> heard<00:04:19.770> the<00:04:20.010> same

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
version 3.0 with an IQ I heard the same

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.130 
version 3.0 with an IQ I heard the same
there's<00:04:21.480> something<00:04:22.790> so<00:04:23.790> I<00:04:23.820> guess<00:04:24.180> they<00:04:24.390> the

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
there's something so I guess they the

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.910 
there's something so I guess they the
console<00:04:25.590> works<00:04:25.890> exactly<00:04:26.430> the<00:04:26.670> same<00:04:27.920> version

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
console works exactly the same version

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.900 
console works exactly the same version
so<00:04:29.960> this<00:04:30.960> was<00:04:31.230> much<00:04:31.440> taller<00:04:31.770> video<00:04:32.130> to<00:04:32.310> help<00:04:32.460> to

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
so this was much taller video to help to

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.840 
so this was much taller video to help to
