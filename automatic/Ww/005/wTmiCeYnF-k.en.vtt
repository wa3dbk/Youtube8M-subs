00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.299
 victory after the opening goal of seeing on a handsome goal 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:12.229
 in addition, it is very difficult 

00:00:12.229 --> 00:00:13.969
 that's what i say 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.180
 it is acquitted also may he was against what but came and then I can 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.199
 just good for him in tukkers 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.869
 good start to the season anyway yes it is of course nice if you 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.289
 so we hope to get up early in the early days to play ahead 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:27.220
 is not coming 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.419
 well so we could be embarrassed to work towards the 2 0 after which this succeeded 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:33.840
 play well tonight 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.890
 seen some good moments that do, there are already several moments in the two 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.880
 for example, a ten-minute phase 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.460
 empathy that we played full with less that we were sloppy 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.890
 eventually a penalty came again 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.190
 Which 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.260
 that should look like you know you then 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.130
 we played quite nicely, and his record summer was a bit out of our hands again 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.040
 moment that we may have already decided but it is just too bad that 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.670
 you say that phase again but let the reins celebrate we are again 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.530
 got a little faith around the camp from an intern in the second half one 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.950
 Interim period had a lot in the second half, we should have been concerned 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:08.500
 that became 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.620
 that is erratic and and usually it comes if we like a zero like it 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.190
 already 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.570
 and still 0 0 or if it is 2 0 I have said what is there 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.040
 high level 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.820
 as soon as possible a new must that municipalities need the rider 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.580
 this as someone one if you make it 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.170
 at risk and it is around sixteen then I don't think so at all 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.930
 bad but there are times when you are not allowed to lose the ball 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.530
 and reactor will be den bosch I think it still happens at times 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.729
 prevent the situation in being able to play even better and break him understanding 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.460
 to play I think 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.740
 the ek surprise effect paint can than at times it can be better and better 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.910
 do a good yes of course it takes its time but we want it so quickly 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.200
 possibly also what the trainer I want there had been after a high level and 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.479
 and that is why the eisa are just diving very high, but good there 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.000
 we must ensure that we arrive in this very short term, you know 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.430
 full with 3 0 which went very well 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.440
 where did we say the rest these matches most people we have together 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.039
 52 minutes at times 50 well played opportunities created 

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:15.529
 so that is very positive 

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:18.209
 we have dominated 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.959
 with a lot of things I am satisfied with what a discharge 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.259
 surface can do that 

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:26.329
 well i have missed a few chances it was one in a pack of chances 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:31.030
 during the match it is wonderful to still be allowed to score the goals 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:36.529
 and it is also the race and the finish to be able to decide 

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:39.529
 between at 3 0 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:42.019
 to score with 3 0 is clear that 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:43.980
 that was the game actually lows 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.859
 they feel good for me and waxaar 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:48.629
 and also for the tenth time 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:52.480
 What also stood out was that you look bleak out and then has none on hold 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.519
 and not for example the newest 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:56.429
 well yes 

00:02:56.429 --> 00:03:01.099
 can think logically and if i'm not so sure of the last climb and too 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.889
 fall 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:03.539
 the maximum participated 

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:05.329
 I had the man 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.790
 be on the paper for Monday and then you have to make a choice 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:10.929
 marketer 

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:14.379
 and normally I would definitely have brought it if they were too risk-averse 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:18.099
 do say if you fall a beautiful nature but again just Monday 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:19.949
 play what used to be the case 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.250
 but now I have to take that into account 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.970
 and it is certainly an advantage more openness also requires such competitions 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:26.549
 but 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.290
 at the moment I think I will go for a facility that also goes on 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.289
 possession control 

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:36.129
 and loads that lie just doing really well in recent weeks 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:38.389
 hence the choice 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:40.979
 However, then you sit the week and weigh on the couch 

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:42.530
 yes that's right for weeks 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.450
 no jan mulder, I think is too long, but it will also be worse 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.519
 nicolaas boys and 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.049
 so today 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.019
 if we don't have two matches in germany 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.689
 year after year but lower than the new head coach of the government
