00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:12.360
 apron lift the board 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.360
 will overtake 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.910
 homework 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:28.710
 Best regards from the studies of 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.710
 sergio live plans http stars achievements 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:36.100
 and the plan as you already know good 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.070
 ladies and gentlemen it seems that it is already 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.290
 done lucas sielva say that it is already 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.790
 signed by Real Madrid that today what 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.309
 they are going to announce that on Monday they will 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.230
 present player coming from the cruzeiro 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.600
 from Brazil, a player that I 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.640
 practically good I personally do not 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.559
 I've seen play in my life I do not know how 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.110
 he plays I do not know what features he has 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.570
 so I can not value your game 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.250
 do not 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.510
 I really feel sorry that having 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.550
 casemiro 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.490
 ceded or sold with repurchase option 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.350
 port is signed to another Brazilian who 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.990
 I do not know if it's better or worse I hope it's 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.030
 better but we go kamikaze I look like I like 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.190
 quite as a player and could really 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.870
 have been an option if they wanted a 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.460
 player of that position to attract him to him 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.320
 but I do not understand the things that 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.180
 Real Madrid makes it clear that 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.440
 Ancelotti and Casemiro did not like it 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.440
 but what are you going to do 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.750
 we have also signed the kid in or 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.640
 claw that is 16 years old nothing but 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.320
 dance directly to castilla 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.440
 and well let's see how it goes 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.090
 player because this is a player that 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.700
 They seem technically good but clear 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.140
 watching videos of those who have put 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.390
 neither can we say what love 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.300
 how many players can be seen in 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.190
 youtube with incredible technical quality 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.220
 but then at the moment of truth 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.800
 they are frills but you have to be there 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.930
 do more things than that, so not 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.600
 we know what this player will bring 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.550
 we have to have a great future is 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.980
 better to have the registrations and it has not cost 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.210
 very expensive either that the pinchers bayern 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.200
 or I've done another team and then we 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.090
 we have to regret 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.310
 and well then the case comes and 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.800
 really that is said it is rumored that 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.150
 can go to the athletic team of bilbao and good 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.629
 I already said yesterday in streaming and what 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:25.180
 I repeat again now either to Bilbao or 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:28.200
 I mean, I would not sell you illarramendi 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.000
 not to pay the clause or drunk 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.800
 I already said it a long time ago in one 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.720
 from my first blogs I think it 's the 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.260
 first and all what he says talking about 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.260
 falcao 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.290
 and it's that good to bilbao to valencia and 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.720
 to the athletic of madrid are clubs that 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.280
 never in life would we have to sell him 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.260
 nothing unless they pay the clause of 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.060
 player because they are teams that always 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.120
 We putean whenever we want or that 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.040
 they sell it to anyone before they 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.900
 real madrid the athletic of bilbao not us 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.340
 he wanted to sell neither to llorente and javi 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.620
 martÃ­nez 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.209
 more said life impossible these 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.950
 players as long as no masses is for 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.599
 the real Madrid 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.190
 and Madrid is going to give him now 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:09.599
 really the bilbao that pays the 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.849
 pussy clause 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.800
 enough of being the fools of the neighborhood 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.200
 always always the fools are the real 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.910
 Madrid to Valencia the same thing we never 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.220
 They want to sell shit and then 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.200
 we give them the players to 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.660
 athletic more of the same because nothing is 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.160
 finished the subnormal being that pays neither 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.200
 point if they want you to pay if you do not 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.870
 I prefer to give it to another team of 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.099
 shit so clear this is what there is 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.410
 Ladies and gentlemen, I do not know what you think 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:36.569
 you enough since they would be real 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.280
 madrid and what Florentine allows 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.599
 because then when it 's Florentine itchy 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.180
 the door to sign a player 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.799
 they close the doors the noses 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.870
 and they prefer to sell to anyone 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.519
 let it go free as if it were like 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.260
 was llorente before selling it to the real 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:53.030
 madrid and get 36 million that could 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.110
 to have taken out in the end I am very pissed 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.269
 really the Brazilian this is going to 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.190
 come I do not know if it's better than actually 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.989
 I do not really truth the 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.269
 really and has not given a good level 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.590
 but well I think it's not bad either 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:06.450
 player 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.040
 and of course if you do not give opportunities 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.349
 prefer to give opportunities to khedira 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.140
 a player who is theoretically going to go 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:15.090
 I still do not believe that it ends 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.500
 contract and does not want to renew before 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.660
 she really and I are things that are not 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.329
 I understand but well that's the way the real 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.620
 madrid like this works football nothing will be 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.620
 what you expect, they see it
