00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:04.189
 so I went to the leader bloquista questioned the president 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.010
 Why not 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.739
 I eat out 

00:00:08.739 --> 00:00:10.509
 she is a pretty woman 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:12.059
 across the southeast 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.929
 what a person so act together 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:17.929
 during the visit of the economist 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:21.909
 do not change it 

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:27.349
 with the sudden silence and solidarity I made a great journey destined to attack 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:29.109
 I'm a fan of the series. 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.109
 is that I was not responsible for the departure of the Argentine midfielder 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.060
 apparently she sighed 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.470
 but maybe he's not working on revenge against me 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.060
 the counter attack 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.250
 fragile rejected the time to fight against anyone 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.400
 mainly against it 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.140
 I think that's allowed 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.480
 at home 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.480
 Do you really believe that? 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.330
 but why are you making the case had 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.110
 I'll stay until yesterday 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.110
 the proposal creates in the saints to conquer the maximum title 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.800
 This does not make sense on a motorbike. 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.330
 not even 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.330
 then your power 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.950
 even though we did not stay all this time together 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.220
 I tried to use it includes a stroll through the city of sÃ£o paulo 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.740
 so no destiny 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.220
 in crimes 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.130
 what do you feel 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.980
 I was needing a little 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.980
 mute 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.340
 bad moments in the initial quintet 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.020
 dir 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.590
 but the protests 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.629
 it looks like it's going now 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.679
 this is not true 

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:15.469
 hard for me when it comes to a hit 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:18.469
 of your life of our life 

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:21.639
 it's great 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:24.639
 more than anything 

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.779
