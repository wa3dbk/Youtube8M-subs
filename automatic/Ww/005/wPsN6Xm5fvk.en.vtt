00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:14.740
 we are in the third broken of exact love 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:18.580
 and what's with the shotguns worth 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:22.390
 and let's start with the remington with 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:26.780
 a rc I do not know what 870 color was but the 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:30.910
 burst and nothing can see what 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.910
 perhaps without truce and camouflage 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.380
 in this master draft challenge in this 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.380
 rock the diamond what I'm going to 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.780
 the set of more or more shotguns 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.879
 least which one I like the most or the 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.079
 which is the most manageable for what 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.079
 situations for example not 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:59.370
 so let's call complete 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:03.360
 to start with a ranking let's say that 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.549
 for me the best general would be at the time 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.180
 of the remington both by scope by 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.180
 manageability 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:16.050
 realism so it's a shotgun 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.440
 it would be my first choice 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.500
 The next 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:26.210
 it also depends a bit, let's say 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.740
 by the power would be with which 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.660
 we could play not only games 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.930
 but normal items that 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:35.900
 let's also say we can separate the 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.140
 unique tool groups demands for 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.600
 normal games watch because you play 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.540
 social extremes because they used to 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:49.430
 I like but I married for items 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:51.250
 normal items and that 12 m2 16 for 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.810
 Brand new 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.810
 ok, here we finish with the 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:03.650
 they started that 12 vale 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.850
 summarizing first the mental then 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.290
 the street 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.290
 for the theme 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:23.790
 and for the power and after that 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.310
 I begin to have many questions why 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.340
 to get me the sign arming the 12 I 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.660
 I had a pretty good time 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:36.019
 it did not cost me as much as the s12 but a 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:40.129
 Once I learned how to use the s12 it has 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:44.510
 liked more than the m-12 then I have 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:47.450
 one doubt and that I'm not very sure 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.780
 I think that in third place I'm going to put the 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.200
 s12 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:57.750
 I can not tell you exactly why and 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.750
 that has come to obviate but 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.740
 but I think it's going to be a matter of 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:07.790
 chargers worth 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.790
 answer 2 summarizing what 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:15.260
 that a drone 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:17.840
 that is the ranking or remington kg 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:22.010
 we have here the skills of 12 and 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:24.810
 then the m-12 16 either 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:28.940
 Bogota but something special not just 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:31.700
 for pleasure so I play ways 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.290
 well here you see the house that is with 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.050
 the diamonds can be shot 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:42.060
 letting it get lost 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:42.060
 and nothing to extreme 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:52.420
 use all but fixed that we are going to use 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:55.030
 it is also that even in extreme 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:58.530
 do without marquez then imagine using them 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.530
 in normal games for me 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.049
 m16 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.760
 and for me it's a kind of madness that 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.350
 to use it in normal items because 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.800
 yes with a weapon 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:17.440
 that does not make so many hits Tuesday you need 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:22.390
 a charger to kill imagine and with 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:25.120
 this is impossible that it is not that 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:28.720
 will play normal with these weapons and kill and 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.000
 it will make its streaks and such but I think 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.220
 complicate life a bit not for that 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.910
 how is the tool that you kill yourself 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.210
 for sleeping 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.990
 so that's what there is that is my 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.690
 opinion 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.310
 summarizing a bit what I have done and 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.460
 nothing I hope you liked what 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:49.310
 next today are those fossils 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:52.160
 and here I leave you previous videos and such 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.259
 so that sex is a look and nothing 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.039
 see you in the next see you later 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:57.039
 a greeting
