revolutionary line it was called the

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.120 
revolutionary line it was called the
40-plus<00:00:14.780> extreme<00:00:15.780> distances<00:00:16.560> were<00:00:16.770> achieved

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
40-plus extreme distances were achieved

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.620 
40-plus extreme distances were achieved
with<00:00:17.460> ease<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:18.750> reason<00:00:19.050> for<00:00:19.230> it<00:00:19.350> was<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:19.920> was<00:00:20.220> a

manufactured shooting head thin running
line<00:00:25.010> thick<00:00:26.010> belly<00:00:26.720> the<00:00:27.720> downside<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.800> was

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
line thick belly the downside of it was

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.820 
line thick belly the downside of it was
that<00:00:30.119> because<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.810> goes<00:00:30.990> from<00:00:31.199> thick<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.800> thin

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
that because it goes from thick to thin

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.990 
that because it goes from thick to thin
in<00:00:32.279> one<00:00:32.759> step<00:00:33.320> after<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.800> season<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.460> casting

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
in one step after a season of casting

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.200 
in one step after a season of casting
used<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.719> hinge<00:00:37.170> in<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.860> point<00:00:38.129> there<00:00:38.489> the

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
used to hinge in that point there the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.760 
used to hinge in that point there the
coating<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.809> break<00:00:39.960> off<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.379> even<00:00:40.680> the

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
coating is to break off and even the

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.139 
coating is to break off and even the
head<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.219> snap<00:00:41.489> off<00:00:41.700> so<00:00:43.430> 2011<00:00:44.430> believe<00:00:44.969> it

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
head is to snap off so 2011 believe it

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.049 
head is to snap off so 2011 believe it
believe<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.539> hype<00:00:45.870> or<00:00:46.050> not<00:00:46.579> they've<00:00:47.579> improved

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
believe the hype or not they've improved

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.360 
believe the hype or not they've improved
on<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.360> product<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.200> what<00:00:49.320> they<00:00:49.440> say<00:00:49.649> and

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
on the product this is what they say and

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.540 
on the product this is what they say and
what<00:00:50.430> they've<00:00:50.789> done<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.829> there<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:53.010> no<00:00:53.250> bump

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
what they've done is there is no bump

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.910 
what they've done is there is no bump
there<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.210> no<00:00:54.420> transition<00:00:54.840> point<00:00:55.320> it's<00:00:55.710> a

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
there is no transition point it's a

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.790 
there is no transition point it's a
longer<00:00:56.430> back<00:00:57.059> taper<00:00:57.390> they've<00:00:58.020> kept<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.559> same

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
longer back taper they've kept the same

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.299 
longer back taper they've kept the same
head<00:00:59.309> weight<00:00:59.640> but<00:01:00.530> because<00:01:01.530> there's<00:01:01.859> no<00:01:02.010> lump

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
head weight but because there's no lump

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.719 
head weight but because there's no lump
you<00:01:02.850> should<00:01:03.090> get<00:01:03.270> no<00:01:03.690> hinging<00:01:04.229> whatsoever<00:01:04.830> the

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
you should get no hinging whatsoever the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.490 
you should get no hinging whatsoever the
other<00:01:05.850> thing<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.270> because<00:01:06.720> there's<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.990> longer

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
other thing is because there's a longer

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.740 
other thing is because there's a longer
back<00:01:07.680> taper<00:01:07.979> when<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.820> are<00:01:08.939> using<00:01:09.240> the

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
back taper when you are using the

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.950 
back taper when you are using the
original<00:01:09.990> one<00:01:10.470> if<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:11.549> analyzed<00:01:12.060> too<00:01:12.600> much<00:01:12.780> of

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
original one if you analyzed too much of

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.410 
original one if you analyzed too much of
this<00:01:13.130> the<00:01:14.130> loop<00:01:14.400> would<00:01:14.610> collapse<00:01:14.880> in<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.210> air

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
this the loop would collapse in the air

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.010 
this the loop would collapse in the air
because<00:01:16.580> but<00:01:17.580> with<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.850> new<00:01:18.060> one<00:01:18.270> because<00:01:18.780> of

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
because but with a new one because of

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.039 
because but with a new one because of
the<00:01:19.229> longer<00:01:19.530> back<00:01:19.890> taper<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.909> be<00:01:21.210> able<00:01:21.450> to

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
the longer back taper you be able to

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.679 
the longer back taper you be able to
analyze<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.650> little<00:01:23.220> bit<00:01:23.369> more<00:01:23.610> line<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.119> then

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
analyze a little bit more line and then

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.789 
analyze a little bit more line and then
shoot<00:01:25.229> greater<00:01:25.920> distances<00:01:26.729> but<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.380> only<00:01:28.530> way

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
shoot greater distances but the only way

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.399 
shoot greater distances but the only way
to<00:01:28.860> find<00:01:29.220> out<00:01:29.369> if<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.939> hype<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.270> true<00:01:30.450> well
