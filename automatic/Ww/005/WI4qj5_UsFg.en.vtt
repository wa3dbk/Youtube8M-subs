00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720 

so<00:00:00.930> we<00:00:01.350> worked<00:00:01.500> out<00:00:01.740> some<00:00:02.010> math<00:00:02.220> that<00:00:02.520> allowed

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
so we worked out some math that allowed

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.820 
so we worked out some math that allowed
being<00:00:03.000> achieved<00:00:03.090> uh<00:00:03.570> see<00:00:04.319> we're<00:00:04.500> working<00:00:04.770> on

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
being achieved uh see we're working on

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.650 
being achieved uh see we're working on

anyway<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:19.830> was<00:00:20.600> how<00:00:21.600> I<00:00:21.630> got<00:00:21.869> help<00:00:22.109> but<00:00:22.350> with

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
anyway that was how I got help but with

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.920 
anyway that was how I got help but with
on<00:00:22.890> mathematics<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.609> that<00:00:23.820> but<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.630> way<00:00:24.750> the

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
on mathematics of that but the way the

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.720 
on mathematics of that but the way the
engine<00:00:25.260> works<00:00:25.470> it's<00:00:25.920> on<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.189> same<00:00:26.400> principle

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
engine works it's on the same principle

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.050 
engine works it's on the same principle

open up two parter particle chambers
you're<00:00:45.450> going<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.719> get<00:00:45.840> all<00:00:46.110> this<00:00:46.440> matter

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
you're going to get all this matter

you're going to get all this matter
flowing<00:00:47.309> out<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:48.120> matter<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.570> moving<00:00:49.020> like<00:00:49.160> so

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
flowing out the matter is moving like so

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.090 
flowing out the matter is moving like so

1971<00:03:21.440> that<00:03:21.830> I<00:03:21.950> know<00:03:22.010> for<00:03:22.400> sure<00:03:22.580> so<00:03:23.360> if<00:03:23.780> they've

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
1971 that I know for sure so if they've

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.350 
1971 that I know for sure so if they've

been lined in Roswell very likely its

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.940 
been lined in Roswell very likely its
truths<00:03:26.690> they've<00:03:26.959> been<00:03:27.080> lying<00:03:27.260> 50<00:03:27.739> consecutive

years<00:03:28.580> and<00:03:28.670> probably<00:03:29.030> much<00:03:29.390> longer<00:03:29.750> than<00:03:29.900> that

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
years and probably much longer than that

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.560 
years and probably much longer than that
the<00:03:31.070> engine<00:03:31.400> i<00:03:31.520> saw<00:03:31.760> did<00:03:32.090> not<00:03:32.270> come<00:03:32.540> from

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
the engine i saw did not come from

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.140 
the engine i saw did not come from
Roswell<00:03:33.320> crash<00:03:33.500> the<00:03:34.220> engine<00:03:34.489> i<00:03:34.580> saw<00:03:34.820> was<00:03:35.030> as

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
Roswell crash the engine i saw was as

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.690 
Roswell crash the engine i saw was as
big<00:03:35.360> as<00:03:35.390> the<00:03:35.660> Roswell<00:03:36.110> crashed<00:03:36.500> so<00:03:37.340> this<00:03:37.520> is

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
big as the Roswell crashed so this is

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.640 
big as the Roswell crashed so this is
something<00:03:37.940> even<00:03:38.180> bigger<00:03:38.510> that's<00:03:39.020> another<00:03:39.410> one

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
something even bigger that's another one

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.800 
something even bigger that's another one
so<00:03:40.310> how<00:03:40.550> many<00:03:40.610> do<00:03:40.880> they<00:03:40.910> have<00:03:41.030> how<00:03:41.480> much<00:03:41.630> they

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810

that's<00:03:56.629> where<00:03:56.959> the<00:03:57.109> danger<00:03:57.319> is<00:03:57.560> is<00:03:58.060> that<00:03:59.060> if<00:03:59.239> it

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
that's where the danger is is that if it

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.440 
that's where the danger is is that if it
comes<00:03:59.780> out<00:04:00.019> it's<00:04:00.950> not<00:04:01.219> so<00:04:01.430> much<00:04:01.609> as<00:04:01.879> the

it's<00:05:03.860> the<00:05:04.400> dimensions<00:05:05.090> the<00:05:05.720> way<00:05:05.870> the<00:05:06.020> walls

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:06.229 
it's the dimensions the way the walls
