00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.000
 hello and welcome video in 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.130
 this video I want to show you how 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.389
 he himself can produce skin glue 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.370
 that's what you need me for example 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.920
 on carnival if you somehow 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.630
 masses want to face or as 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.600
 Santa Claus disguises you then 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.109
 stick a beard or other things 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.460
 where he just stick something to the skin 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.439
 we just wanted it to be quite simple 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.769
 I have things here now 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:32.250
 sugar is only 15 grams over there 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.300
 because according to the recipe you need twice 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.190
 as much as I once just a 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.450
 a little less so I say the same 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.520
 still how much you can do here after that 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.590
 recipe needs 415 grams in any case 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:46.289
 sugar 420 grams starch 4 15 milliliters 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.430
 water and you again 75 milliliters 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.920
 water should all be separated 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:56.010
 the strength here looks so silky 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:01.649
 Food starch is on it and sugar 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:06.810
 is really so first of all we do 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:09.119
 the strengths with the sugar here is the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.420
 stronger on this cottage with the 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:16.740
 sugar without 30 meters water depth in 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.259
 my case just 15 together then 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.040
 mix 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.040
 then only one option is needed 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:28.560
 then boil water and go to 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.909
 Stir the fork and a whole time 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.189
 Here we have 15 milliliters 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.350
 Water is only very little we do 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.220
 Just look at her I really just see 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.619
 very little and then we are looking for that 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.200
 whole here to stir the whole one 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.659
 uniform mass is the whole could 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.820
 to be a little less watery 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.530
 but you should really only very little 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.220
 use and that's why I try 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.680
 easy to get done with little 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.610
 the whole in uniform mass will be 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.770
 all Klumpp now for me is 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:06.869
 but okay alfred rider pipes with the 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.979
 quotations maybe okay away the 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.050
 whole is now a reasonably 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.580
 uniform mass and now come yet 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.490
 the dogs the 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.170
 70 ml of water as I said like that 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.000
 stands prescription original I say at the end 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.150
 I still do that half 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.350
 Much will be 75 milliliters of water here 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.810
 the bremer to cook 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.480
 either just in the cooking pot normal 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.480
 or so, who will be here so far 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.670
 that I'm bumming around here so much 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:37.890
 kettle after me that just in 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:42.180
 and cook it all right now 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:44.220
 All over the country was an okay water boiling 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.630
 in the water koran already hears sight 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.550
 bubbled and it should go exactly 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:54.180
 that pays off everyone waits neatly 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:59.070
 cooks 75 meters I just go 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:01.260
 the whole probably not yet 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:05.070
 the lower level already give that pretty much 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.060
 That's why it has become solid for the whole 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.620
 now here again 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.260
 now the whole thing solved again 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.800
 celebrated in this hot water what you 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:18.890
 it looks a bit like that 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:21.239
 right in wiso glue just from munich 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.620
 no idea I should describe 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:27.420
 sweet potato maybe such a 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:29.430
 bit because the strength is record and 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.440
 yes that was really nice 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.450
 I'm just saying that again 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.650
 recipe in original looks and that 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.800
 It draws me into the relationship of 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.900
 as follows from 40 grams of starch 30 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.330
 grams of sugar then always 30 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.730
 milliliter of water in order to emi strength and 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:48.360
 mix sugar and 150 again 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:51.380
 milliliters of water around the whole now 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.070
 here the hot water just the original 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.660
 Mixing ratio I have now exactly 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.700
 half the whole is then so here 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.860
 many feelings parties stick so that 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.010
 already loosely enough, no idea and 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.290
 I can do it now but can now 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.150
 you do not do anything with it at first 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.799
 Although the whole thing you can do it first 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.390
 cool down until the whole just stopped 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.830
 is so hot then the whole also 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:15.790
 they are already being used here 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:18.639
 as well as a white broth and 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.009
 that even tinker already a 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:22.660
 imitating additional video game is 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:24.460
 something very simple you need at all 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:28.270
 buy nothing expensive and is synonymous completely 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:31.110
 fast forward and yes a sex video 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.110
 and ciao
