00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:07.350
 the images around with neymar embraced the 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.820
 adriano and now hugged to see daniel 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.950
 alves 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.680
 if I see that neymar is already set 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.190
 to barcelona that one only sees the neymar 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.190
 side of Brazilians 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.490
 the Brazilian does this everywhere 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.920
 world the baran everywhere they go 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.289
 join if you have already seen there in instagram is that 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.119
 They did barbecue there at daniel's house . 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.949
 alves is the athletic supporter of 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.680
 proud madrid in the middle of the 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.430
 barcelona the brilliance is natural that 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.340
 Brazilians already had already had there 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.090
 daniel along with philip mountbatten 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.920
 according to the manager evaluates against is not no 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.780
 It has not got no fight, not because it is 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.879
 another type of public has no 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.680
 to wrap it up like a game 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.500
 involving the england team from another 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.210
 country but this game is a clear game who 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.000
 saw you inside the field and the players 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.949
 putin and the guys fighting and fight a lot 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.989
 to take the title but it is not a game 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.789
 which has a great rivalry between 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.880
 fans are the staff is coming back 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:12.060
 holiday is still summer in europe in 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.859
 spain staff still enjoying almost 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.350
 of the morning now in Spain at last a game 

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:17.880
 later there are many tourists in 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.950
 barcelona accompanying this match 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.639
 also right there in the camp then it's a 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:27.749
 I play a little different but I found 

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:29.999
 ooo barak neymar has been more and more 

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:31.619
 being at ease in these last days 

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:34.289
 we accompanied neymar 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.149
 in Barcelona in the first games 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:37.950
 I thought I know very worrying 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:39.810
 pass the ball because that business of 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.999
 arrive and not get a reputation for wanting 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.939
 get and be the owner of the team so I 

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:48.389
 I thought it was been letting go will get 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:51.450
 to release even more and the messi that the people 

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:53.159
 I was watching him coming to take 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.500
 team account at the time it happened for 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.720
 I already got the ball because I think I 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.160
 and taking all the jokes that the 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.450
 people more in the transmission and there 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.580
 people who do not understand 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.530
 There are a lot of people who do not understand but I 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.780
 I think the messi for the first time has 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.310
 someone there to share the spotlight 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.890
 truly with him you think 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.180
 Actually the boss is annoyed with the 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:18.130
 presence and not neymar more than one player 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:22.930
 individual attention and thinks that 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:25.120
 It's bothering verse I do not know if 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.230
 is bothering bothering I do not know if 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.510
 the word but I think there's one 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.730
 a little uncomfortable 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.680
 seeing this situation because it is the first 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.480
 Once this is happening, a 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.280
 face that has charisma that has 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.989
 personality is there neymar who took 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:43.150
 at the end, an elbow of the afr flight 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:44.920
 year a rise eee is also being 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.190
 treated in such neymar now finished 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.170
 in the live image with the glass and I think 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.660
 more and more at ease 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.090
 I think I feel more and more comfortable and I think 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.580
 Victor Sérgio Rodrigues that I 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.190
 honestly we play very big 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.640
 the transmission to people but I think I 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.709
 I'm curious to see the messi know 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.590
 dividing a little with neymar this 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.810
 story then I disagree with you I 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.810
 I do not think that's it, I do not think 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.090
 messi is something that we have already 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.580
 posture of messi 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.530
 It seems to me that he does not care much for 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.070
 so what do you think is happening to the 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:27.070
 messi is that the messi is not 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:30.040
 it's all the way while we've had bids from 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:32.470
 game there is not the way he was 23 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.530
 seasons I do not know if the fact that he 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.989
 to have hurt the fact that he had had 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.660
 and there the great defense of Valdés bid of the 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.970
 game we showed up what would be a 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.760
 ipiranga great goal ended up being the defense if 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.630
 ipiranga is I think the fact that it has 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.579
 got hurt 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.880
 we talked about it the last big 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:54.340
 messi injury had been is in the world 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.019
 before the 2006 club world championship 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.000
 that intercontinental world won the 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.500
 barcelona when I did not even have 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.720
 started was guardiola was still the 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.860
 hacker and all that was the last big 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.720
 injury of mexico 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.400
 I think the last injury here that 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.530
 took the master from the final stretch of the 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.100
 and got into the mood the way 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.050
 entered against the psg 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.640
 neither came against Bayern I think 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.470
 This is hurting him. 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.170
 I think this has changed a bit to the face 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.120
 him and he is not being what the 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.980
 messi that we used to see with 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.880
 confidence that when it's time to go 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.260
 will pass 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.900
 I think it's happening this is not 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.850
 No, I do not think so. 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.620
 impressions you gave your impression 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.320
 Andrew and I'm giving mine I think 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.390
 that this is not going to change not because you want 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.250
 or do not want Barcelona is the team of 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.780
 mexico will not be the arrival of neymar 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.780
 Now it's going to change that.
