00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:05.510 
last video before the game is launched
we're<00:00:04.410> only<00:00:04.529> got<00:00:04.680> a<00:00:04.710> couple<00:00:04.920> hours<00:00:05.069> of<00:00:05.250> open

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
we're only got a couple hours of open

quickly the ship customization screen
and<00:00:09.300> here<00:00:10.170> we<00:00:10.320> see<00:00:10.710> my<00:00:11.160> cruiser<00:00:11.880> again<00:00:12.150> the

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
and here we see my cruiser again the

Constitution<00:00:13.349> refit<00:00:14.130> class<00:00:14.460> USS<00:00:14.880> Providence

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
Constitution refit class USS Providence

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.070 
Constitution refit class USS Providence
and<00:00:16.320> we<00:00:17.310> see<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.550> set<00:00:17.880> of<00:00:18.029> templates<00:00:18.810> that<00:00:19.020> you

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
and we see a set of templates that you

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.099 
and we see a set of templates that you
can<00:00:19.140> choose<00:00:19.260> for<00:00:19.680> your<00:00:19.800> ship<00:00:20.539> basically<00:00:21.539> when

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
can choose for your ship basically when

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.540 
can choose for your ship basically when
you<00:00:22.230> get<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.410> ship<00:00:22.680> like<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.830> cruiser

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
you get a ship like a cruiser

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.279 
you get a ship like a cruiser
you<00:00:23.880> have<00:00:24.000> your<00:00:24.119> basic<00:00:24.269> stat<00:00:24.720> templates<00:00:25.199> you

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
you have your basic stat templates you

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.120 
you have your basic stat templates you
can<00:00:25.439> use<00:00:27.080> which<00:00:28.080> are<00:00:28.199> essentially<00:00:28.680> similar<00:00:28.920> to

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
can use which are essentially similar to

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.890 
can use which are essentially similar to
design<00:00:29.400> no<00:00:30.029> matter<00:00:30.210> what<00:00:30.330> design<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:30.689> choose

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
design no matter what design you choose

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.569 
design no matter what design you choose
it's<00:00:31.050> gonna<00:00:31.140> have<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.410> same<00:00:31.740> functionality

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
it's gonna have the same functionality

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.130 
it's gonna have the same functionality
when<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:32.969> get<00:00:33.149> in<00:00:33.239> game<00:00:33.890> so<00:00:34.890> here<00:00:35.460> we<00:00:35.640> see

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
when you get in game so here we see

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.479 
when you get in game so here we see
these<00:00:37.140> three<00:00:37.410> options<00:00:37.890> let's<00:00:38.100> go<00:00:38.160> back<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.399> the

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
these three options let's go back to the

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.450 
these three options let's go back to the
Constitution<00:00:38.790> my<00:00:39.570> favorite<00:00:40.100> you<00:00:41.100> can<00:00:41.129> click

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
Constitution my favorite you can click

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.950 
Constitution my favorite you can click
on<00:00:41.610> randomize<00:00:42.210> if<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.390> want<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.629> completely

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
on randomize if you want to completely

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.440 
on randomize if you want to completely
randomized<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.559> mix<00:00:43.739> parts<00:00:44.149> so<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.239> can<00:00:45.329> see

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
randomized and mix parts so you can see

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.139 
randomized and mix parts so you can see
the<00:00:45.570> different<00:00:45.840> changes<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.440> makes<00:00:47.149> so

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
the different changes that it makes so

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.610 
the different changes that it makes so
we<00:00:48.210> click<00:00:48.420> random<00:00:48.660> that's<00:00:49.110> an<00:00:49.230> interesting

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
we click random that's an interesting

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.170 
we click random that's an interesting
design<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:50.100> we'll<00:00:50.190> start<00:00:50.399> there<00:00:50.700> click<00:00:51.090> on

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
design so we'll start there click on

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.389 
design so we'll start there click on
advanced<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.899> here<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.860> can<00:00:53.010> make<00:00:53.160> all<00:00:53.280> the

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
advanced and here you can make all the

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.880 
advanced and here you can make all the
different<00:00:53.670> changes<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.270> want<00:00:54.680> based<00:00:55.680> on

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
different changes that you want based on

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.700 
different changes that you want based on
those<00:00:56.070> three<00:00:56.399> designs<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.300> for<00:00:58.260> example<00:00:58.620> the

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
those three designs so for example the

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.400 
those three designs so for example the
hull<00:00:58.890> here<00:00:59.629> would<00:01:00.629> be<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.870> bottom<00:01:01.199> portion

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
hull here would be the bottom portion

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.500 
hull here would be the bottom portion
that<00:01:01.710> we<00:01:01.829> see<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.579> engineering<00:01:03.059> section<00:01:03.420> if

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
that we see the engineering section if

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.050 
that we see the engineering section if
you<00:01:03.600> like<00:01:04.100> so<00:01:05.100> we'll<00:01:05.580> keep<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.790> as<00:01:06.030> a

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
you like so we'll keep that as a

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.990 
you like so we'll keep that as a
constitution<00:01:06.840> then<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:07.890> cells<00:01:08.159> look<00:01:08.909> good

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
constitution then this cells look good

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.280 
constitution then this cells look good
as<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.150> constitution<00:01:09.869> but<00:01:09.960> we<00:01:10.049> could<00:01:10.170> always

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
as a constitution but we could always

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.130 
as a constitution but we could always
experiment<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.010> one<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.430> other<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:12.080> go<00:01:13.080> to

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
experiment to one of the other to go to

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.600 
experiment to one of the other to go to
the<00:01:13.260> best<00:01:13.470> spread<00:01:13.740> look<00:01:13.950> more<00:01:14.130> like<00:01:14.280> what

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
the best spread look more like what

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.370 
the best spread look more like what
you'd<00:01:14.729> expect<00:01:14.820> off<00:01:15.210> an<00:01:15.330> Excelsior<00:01:15.930> class

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
you'd expect off an Excelsior class

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.270 
you'd expect off an Excelsior class
perhaps<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:18.090> neck<00:01:18.619> as<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.710> can<00:01:19.830> see<00:01:20.070> right

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
perhaps the neck as you can see right

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.760 
perhaps the neck as you can see right
here<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.640> middle<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.380> can<00:01:22.380> change<00:01:22.619> that

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
here in the middle you can change that

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.200 
here in the middle you can change that
as<00:01:22.950> well<00:01:23.159> either<00:01:23.490> way<00:01:23.729> it's<00:01:23.909> gonna<00:01:24.000> have<00:01:24.180> the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
as well either way it's gonna have the

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.440 
as well either way it's gonna have the
same<00:01:24.479> general<00:01:24.930> look<00:01:25.140> as<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:26.009> said<00:01:26.310> just<00:01:26.729> just

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
same general look as I said just just

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.580 
same general look as I said just just
changes<00:01:27.810> your<00:01:27.840> look<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.229> doesn't<00:01:28.380> change

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
changes your look it doesn't change

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.710 
changes your look it doesn't change
functionality<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.640> it's<00:01:30.450> not<00:01:30.600> gonna

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
functionality so it's not gonna

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.090 
functionality so it's not gonna
drastically<00:01:31.350> change<00:01:31.590> what<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.799> see<00:01:31.950> on<00:01:32.070> your

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
drastically change what you see on your

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.640 
drastically change what you see on your
ship<00:01:32.400> but<00:01:33.270> we<00:01:33.869> can<00:01:34.020> give<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.320> different

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
ship but we can give that a different

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.929 
ship but we can give that a different
design<00:01:34.890> we'll<00:01:35.009> go<00:01:35.100> with<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.250> Vesper<00:01:35.640> on<00:01:35.729> that

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
design we'll go with a Vesper on that

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.179 
design we'll go with a Vesper on that
same<00:01:36.780> with<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:36.990> pylons<00:01:37.470> we<00:01:37.710> can<00:01:37.829> change<00:01:38.040> that

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
same with the pylons we can change that

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.690 
same with the pylons we can change that
around<00:01:38.960> and<00:01:39.960> then<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.619> saucer<00:01:41.070> obviously<00:01:41.520> we

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
around and then the saucer obviously we

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.700 
around and then the saucer obviously we
know<00:01:41.820> what<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:42.600> we<00:01:43.409> can<00:01:43.560> give

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
know what that is and so we can give

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.880 
know what that is and so we can give
that<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> different<00:01:44.280> look<00:01:44.430> too<00:01:45.140> so<00:01:46.140> that's<00:01:46.770> a

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
that a different look too so that's a

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.139 
that a different look too so that's a
basic<00:01:47.189> overview<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.579> what<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.790> can<00:01:47.880> change

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
basic overview of what you can change

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.450 
basic overview of what you can change
here<00:01:48.420> with<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.600> functionality<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:50.340> can

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
here with the functionality and you can

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.999 
here with the functionality and you can
change<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.790> pattern<00:01:51.000> how<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.479> looks<00:01:51.860> so<00:01:52.860> let's

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
change the pattern how it looks so let's

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.660 
change the pattern how it looks so let's
change<00:01:53.159> on<00:01:53.340> this<00:01:53.460> saucer<00:01:55.159> see<00:01:56.159> how<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.340> notice

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
change on this saucer see how to notice

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.069 
change on this saucer see how to notice
how<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:56.850> changes<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.149> pattern<00:01:57.390> up<00:01:57.630> there<00:01:57.810> so

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
how it changes the pattern up there so

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.139 
how it changes the pattern up there so
you<00:01:58.649> can<00:01:58.799> really<00:01:59.070> change<00:01:59.250> your<00:01:59.369> design<00:02:00.000> and

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
you can really change your design and

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.399 
you can really change your design and
the<00:02:00.210> overall<00:02:00.450> look<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.750> ship<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.049> way

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
the overall look of the ship that way

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.440 
the overall look of the ship that way
you<00:02:02.009> can<00:02:02.130> also<00:02:02.250> change<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.549> material<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.240> ship

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
you can also change the material to ship

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.319 
you can also change the material to ship
which<00:02:03.750> changes<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.500> overall<00:02:04.880> look<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.060> feel

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
which changes the overall look and feel

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.150 
which changes the overall look and feel
of<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.649> so<00:02:07.649> we<00:02:07.740> could<00:02:07.860> do<00:02:07.950> something<00:02:08.160> like<00:02:08.280> that

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
of it so we could do something like that

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.670 
of it so we could do something like that
changing<00:02:11.160> up<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.340> colors<00:02:11.670> here<00:02:12.030> is<00:02:12.470> more<00:02:13.470> so

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
changing up the colors here is more so

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.640 
changing up the colors here is more so
for<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:13.980> logo<00:02:14.190> than<00:02:14.520> anything<00:02:14.730> else<00:02:15.000> but<00:02:15.650> I'm

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
for the logo than anything else but I'm

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.170 
for the logo than anything else but I'm
not<00:02:16.800> gonna<00:02:16.980> talk<00:02:17.160> so<00:02:17.370> much<00:02:17.459> about<00:02:17.520> that

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
not gonna talk so much about that

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.449 
not gonna talk so much about that
so<00:02:18.360> last<00:02:19.260> option<00:02:19.500> here<00:02:19.680> I'm<00:02:19.920> gonna<00:02:20.040> show<00:02:20.250> or

windows way two types of windows we can
show<00:02:22.950> here<00:02:23.160> but<00:02:23.310> we'll<00:02:23.459> zoom<00:02:23.730> in<00:02:24.709> get<00:02:25.709> a<00:02:25.740> nice

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
show here but we'll zoom in get a nice

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.500 
show here but we'll zoom in get a nice
look<00:02:26.130> there<00:02:26.340> up<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:26.580> windows<00:02:26.850> up<00:02:27.000> on<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.240> top

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
look there up the windows up on the top

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.810 
look there up the windows up on the top
of<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.750> saucer<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.350> side<00:02:28.620> we<00:02:29.580> can<00:02:29.760> go

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
of the saucer and the side we can go

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.300 
of the saucer and the side we can go
either<00:02:30.030> between<00:02:30.150> type<00:02:30.480> 1<00:02:30.530> or<00:02:31.530> 2<00:02:31.800> whatever<00:02:32.220> you

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
either between type 1 or 2 whatever you

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.650 
either between type 1 or 2 whatever you
want<00:02:32.490> to<00:02:32.580> look<00:02:32.730> so<00:02:33.000> we<00:02:33.180> could<00:02:33.300> do<00:02:33.360> something

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
want to look so we could do something

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.020 
want to look so we could do something
like<00:02:33.690> that<00:02:33.810> with<00:02:34.080> type<00:02:34.290> 1<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:34.650> that<00:02:35.520> could<00:02:35.820> be

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
like that with type 1 and that could be

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.809 
like that with type 1 and that could be
our<00:02:36.440> cruiser<00:02:37.440> so<00:02:37.920> that<00:02:38.070> was<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.190> quick<00:02:38.370> look<00:02:38.459> of

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
our cruiser so that was a quick look of

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.580 
our cruiser so that was a quick look of
the<00:02:39.150> character<00:02:39.750> or<00:02:39.930> rather<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.350> ship

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
the character or rather the ship

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.920 
the character or rather the ship
