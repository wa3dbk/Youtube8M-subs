00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
around it's because obviously there's a

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.710 
around it's because obviously there's a
big<00:00:31.380> youtubers<00:00:32.009> who<00:00:32.099> want<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.369> make<00:00:32.550> quick<00:00:33.540> bit

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:42.829 
obviously and but there's also like
other<00:00:41.729> things<00:00:41.820> which<00:00:42.150> people<00:00:42.269> just<00:00:42.570> believe

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:42.839 
other things which people just believe

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:44.860 
other things which people just believe
in<00:00:43.049> even<00:00:43.290> though<00:00:43.409> it's<00:00:43.589> complete<00:00:44.100> bullshit

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
in even though it's complete bullshit

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.820 
in even though it's complete bullshit
and<00:00:45.870> we<00:00:46.170> have<00:00:46.379> had<00:00:46.530> several<00:00:46.830> examples<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.729> this

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:48.830 
and we have had several examples of this

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.289 
and we have had several examples of this
being<00:00:49.830> the<00:00:50.040> first<00:00:50.339> with<00:00:50.610> transit<00:00:51.059> which<00:00:51.180> was

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:51.299 
being the first with transit which was

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:54.590 
being the first with transit which was
bus<00:00:51.510> route<00:00:51.720> B<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.489> I<00:00:53.489> mean<00:00:54.000> there<00:00:54.180> was<00:00:54.299> like<00:00:54.540> I

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
bus route B and I mean there was like I

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.359 
bus route B and I mean there was like I
think<00:00:54.869> on<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.080> board<00:00:55.320> which<00:00:55.500> said<00:00:55.710> Bottura<00:00:56.040> B

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:56.369 
think on the board which said Bottura B

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:58.910 
think on the board which said Bottura B
or<00:00:56.519> whatever<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.879> fuck<00:00:57.030> but<00:00:57.390> town<00:00:57.739> there<00:00:58.739> was

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
or whatever the fuck but town there was

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.090 
or whatever the fuck but town there was
no<00:00:59.689> ability<00:01:00.689> for<00:01:01.019> them<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.500> actually<00:01:01.680> go<00:01:02.070> out

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
no ability for them to actually go out

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.520 
no ability for them to actually go out
into<00:01:02.519> that<00:01:03.150> part<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.540> the<00:01:03.689> map<00:01:03.900> and<00:01:04.080> do<00:01:04.260> that

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
into that part of the map and do that

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.500 
into that part of the map and do that
because<00:01:04.739> obviously<00:01:05.100> there<00:01:05.640> was<00:01:05.790> debris<00:01:06.150> which

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
because obviously there was debris which

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.870 
because obviously there was debris which
was<00:01:06.720> there<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:08.010> couldn't<00:01:08.310> get<00:01:08.400> past<00:01:08.640> that

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
was there and you couldn't get past that

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.190 
was there and you couldn't get past that
and<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.119> was<00:01:09.210> non<00:01:09.360> clippable<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.110> he

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
and that was non clippable and he

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.929 
and that was non clippable and he
couldn't<00:01:10.470> get<00:01:10.560> out<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.280> it's<00:01:11.430> just<00:01:11.640> them

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
couldn't get out that and it's just them

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.779 
couldn't get out that and it's just them
it<00:01:12.780> just<00:01:13.140> doesn't<00:01:13.469> work<00:01:13.829> like<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.280> doesn't

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:14.789 
it just doesn't work like it doesn't

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:16.580 
it just doesn't work like it doesn't
it's<00:01:14.969> no<00:01:15.119> such<00:01:15.329> thing<00:01:15.509> as<00:01:15.570> bus<00:01:15.780> would<00:01:15.929> be<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.530> I

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
it's no such thing as bus would be and I

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.160 
it's no such thing as bus would be and I
do<00:01:16.649> understand<00:01:17.189> another<00:01:17.490> reason<00:01:17.880> why<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.780> lot

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
do understand another reason why a lot

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.389 
do understand another reason why a lot
of<00:01:19.350> people<00:01:19.439> believe<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:20.039> this<00:01:20.100> stuff<00:01:20.250> is

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:20.399 
of people believe in this stuff is

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:23.630 
of people believe in this stuff is
because<00:01:20.780> there<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:21.810> like<00:01:22.170> one<00:01:22.500> thing<00:01:22.890> which<00:01:23.609> is

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
because there is like one thing which is

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.469 
because there is like one thing which is
in<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.060> human<00:01:24.210> mind<00:01:24.619> which<00:01:25.759> needs<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:27.119> believe

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
next thing was PhD flopper on die risers

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.370 
next thing was PhD flopper on die risers

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
like some stuff going around where you

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.879 
like some stuff going around where you
could<00:02:04.499> actually<00:02:04.710> get<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.609> which<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:06.119> no<00:02:07.109> and

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:07.889 
could actually get that which is no and

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:09.499 
could actually get that which is no and
also<00:02:08.039> there<00:02:08.310> was<00:02:08.399> mule<00:02:08.729> kick<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.119> PhD<00:02:09.420> flopper

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
also there was mule kick and PhD flopper

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.110 
also there was mule kick and PhD flopper
on<00:02:09.959> mob<00:02:10.560> of<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.709> dead<00:02:10.770> but<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:11.700> was<00:02:11.880> only<00:02:11.940> in

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
on mob of the dead but that was only in

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.760 
on mob of the dead but that was only in
grief<00:02:12.330> moments<00:02:12.840> they're<00:02:13.050> all<00:02:13.170> some<00:02:13.470> people

grief moments they're all some people

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.130 
grief moments they're all some people
thought<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.069> could<00:02:14.190> actually<00:02:14.340> get<00:02:14.610> it<00:02:14.790> in<00:02:15.140> the

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
thought you could actually get it in the

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.250 
thought you could actually get it in the
actual<00:02:16.820> you<00:02:17.820> know<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.180> main<00:02:18.360> game<00:02:18.600> itself<00:02:19.020> but

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
actual you know the main game itself but

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.050 
actual you know the main game itself but
those<00:02:19.470> are<00:02:19.650> decommissioned<00:02:20.340> perk<00:02:20.610> machines

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
those are decommissioned perk machines

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.460 
those are decommissioned perk machines
which<00:02:21.270> are<00:02:21.390> on<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.960> dock<00:02:22.770> and<00:02:22.980> don't

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
which are on the dock and don't

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.760 
which are on the dock and don't
work<00:02:23.680> because<00:02:24.220> fuck<00:02:24.880> you<00:02:25.090> that's<00:02:25.360> why<00:02:25.770> that's

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
work because fuck you that's why that's

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.060 
work because fuck you that's why that's
another<00:02:27.490> thing<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:29.290> next<00:02:29.560> thing<00:02:29.710> would<00:02:29.800> be

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
another thing the next thing would be

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.830 
another thing the next thing would be
the<00:02:30.340> second<00:02:30.790> plain<00:02:31.030> root<00:02:31.270> on<00:02:31.420> mob<00:02:31.630> of<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:31.780> dead

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
the second plain root on mob of the dead

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.730 
the second plain root on mob of the dead
and<00:02:33.090> you<00:02:34.090> just<00:02:34.270> think<00:02:34.540> about<00:02:34.690> that<00:02:34.870> and<00:02:35.380> hits

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
and you just think about that and hits

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:42.060 
and you just think about that and hits
again<00:02:36.460> no<00:02:36.940> no<00:02:37.480> no<00:02:37.900> no<00:02:38.260> no<00:02:38.920> it's<00:02:39.520> not<00:02:39.720> no<00:02:41.070> because

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
again no no no no no it's not no because

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.280 
again no no no no no it's not no because
it<00:02:42.220> interferes<00:02:42.820> completely<00:02:43.360> with<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.660> idea

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
it interferes completely with the idea

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.500 
it interferes completely with the idea
of<00:02:44.410> mob<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:44.980> dead<00:02:45.220> and<00:02:45.520> the<00:02:45.670> story<00:02:45.970> of<00:02:46.180> it<00:02:46.360> is

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
of mob the dead and the story of it is

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.330 
of mob the dead and the story of it is
that<00:02:46.810> you<00:02:47.170> know<00:02:47.290> there's<00:02:47.500> a<00:02:47.590> cycle<00:02:47.980> going<00:02:48.190> on

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
that you know there's a cycle going on

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.400 
that you know there's a cycle going on
and<00:02:48.520> if<00:02:48.610> there<00:02:48.760> was<00:02:48.850> a<00:02:48.880> second<00:02:49.330> plane<00:02:49.510> row<00:02:49.810> then

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
and if there was a second plane row then

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.080 
and if there was a second plane row then
that<00:02:50.830> would<00:02:51.010> completely<00:02:51.400> make<00:02:51.670> everything

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
that would completely make everything

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.180 
that would completely make everything
completely<00:02:52.630> stupid<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:53.380> make<00:02:53.560> no<00:02:53.740> sense<00:02:53.980> at

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
completely stupid and make no sense at

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.620 
completely stupid and make no sense at
all<00:02:54.370> and<00:02:54.400> it<00:02:54.880> doesn't<00:02:55.150> fit<00:02:55.300> in<00:02:55.420> with<00:02:55.450> the

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
all and it doesn't fit in with the

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.920 
all and it doesn't fit in with the
storyline<00:02:55.990> of<00:02:56.290> mob<00:02:56.500> did<00:02:56.770> at<00:02:57.010> all<00:02:57.370> and<00:02:58.330> so<00:02:58.720> that

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
storyline of mob did at all and so that

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.750 
storyline of mob did at all and so that
doesn't<00:02:59.140> make<00:02:59.830> sense<00:03:00.070> the<00:03:00.220> way<00:03:00.250> it's<00:03:00.550> like<00:03:00.700> a

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
doesn't make sense the way it's like a

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.180 
doesn't make sense the way it's like a
fixed<00:03:01.240> thing<00:03:01.390> that<00:03:01.930> is<00:03:02.020> not<00:03:02.230> changing<00:03:02.590> because

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
fixed thing that is not changing because

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.580 
fixed thing that is not changing because
there's<00:03:03.970> nothing<00:03:04.180> else<00:03:04.540> there's<00:03:05.290> nowhere

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
there's nothing else there's nowhere

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.110 
there's nothing else there's nowhere
else<00:03:05.740> to<00:03:05.950> go<00:03:06.100> to<00:03:06.160> it's<00:03:06.459> like<00:03:06.640> you're<00:03:06.760> gonna<00:03:06.850> end

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
else to go to it's like you're gonna end

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.570 
else to go to it's like you're gonna end
up<00:03:07.270> in<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:07.600> city<00:03:07.840> and<00:03:08.200> then<00:03:08.890> find<00:03:09.160> electric

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
up in the city and then find electric

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.250 
up in the city and then find electric
chairs<00:03:09.880> to<00:03:10.150> send<00:03:10.330> you<00:03:10.420> back<00:03:10.600> into<00:03:10.780> market<00:03:11.170> row

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
chairs to send you back into market row

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.949 
chairs to send you back into market row
so<00:03:11.320> that<00:03:11.380> doesn't<00:03:11.650> work<00:03:12.459> and<00:03:13.300> it's<00:03:13.480> just<00:03:13.660> it

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
so that doesn't work and it's just it

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.800 
so that doesn't work and it's just it
doesn't<00:03:14.140> work<00:03:14.830> that<00:03:14.860> way<00:03:15.310> next<00:03:16.180> thing<00:03:16.300> is<00:03:16.330> DLC

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
doesn't work that way next thing is DLC

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.780 
doesn't work that way next thing is DLC
5<00:03:17.050> which<00:03:17.440> isn't<00:03:17.620> fucking<00:03:17.950> happening<00:03:18.160> would

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
5 which isn't fucking happening would

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.490 
5 which isn't fucking happening would
you<00:03:18.940> just<00:03:19.180> shut<00:03:19.390> the<00:03:19.510> fuck<00:03:19.540> up<00:03:19.720> about<00:03:20.140> that<00:03:20.350> for

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
you just shut the fuck up about that for

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.120 
you just shut the fuck up about that for
Christ's<00:03:20.709> sake

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
Christ's sake

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.780

month in succession to the previous one

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.150 
month in succession to the previous one
because<00:03:42.610> obviously<00:03:42.940> they<00:03:43.900> put<00:03:43.930> out<00:03:44.380> the<00:03:44.709> xbox

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.170 
and do I mean we've bus route B I think

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.600 
and do I mean we've bus route B I think
that<00:05:38.350> he<00:05:38.530> mentioned<00:05:38.890> that<00:05:38.980> as<00:05:39.130> well<00:05:39.400> at<00:05:39.580> some

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
that he mentioned that as well at some

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.880 
that he mentioned that as well at some
point<00:05:39.930> on<00:05:40.930> Twitter<00:05:41.290> and<00:05:41.500> there's<00:05:41.620> probably

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:41.890 
point on Twitter and there's probably

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.460 
point on Twitter and there's probably
some<00:05:42.010> other<00:05:42.130> people<00:05:42.750> from<00:05:43.750> Chad<00:05:44.050> doing<00:05:44.260> that

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
some other people from Chad doing that

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.450 
some other people from Chad doing that
but<00:05:44.620> I<00:05:44.680> think<00:05:44.740> that<00:05:44.919> was<00:05:45.130> zillions

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
but I think that was zillions

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.360 
but I think that was zillions
specifically<00:05:46.330> and<00:05:46.660> they<00:05:47.230> do<00:05:47.290> put<00:05:48.160> these

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
specifically and they do put these

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.050 
specifically and they do put these
things<00:05:48.610> out<00:05:48.880> to<00:05:49.360> troll<00:05:49.630> you<00:05:49.960> and<00:05:50.850> just<00:05:51.850> make

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
things out to troll you and just make

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.430 
things out to troll you and just make
you<00:05:52.210> think<00:05:52.419> there's<00:05:52.570> more<00:05:52.750> to<00:05:52.810> the<00:05:53.020> map<00:05:53.200> when

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
you think there's more to the map when

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.470 
you think there's more to the map when
actually<00:05:53.919> they<00:05:54.580> didn't<00:05:54.820> expect<00:05:55.090> people<00:05:55.210> to

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:55.480 
actually they didn't expect people to

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.790 
actually they didn't expect people to
finish<00:05:55.690> the<00:05:55.900> map<00:05:56.050> that<00:05:56.200> early<00:05:56.500> and<00:05:56.530> then

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
finish the map that early and then

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.050 
finish the map that early and then
they've<00:05:57.010> probably<00:05:57.340> gotten<00:05:57.520> bored<00:05:57.700> of<00:05:57.850> it<00:05:57.910> and

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
they've probably gotten bored of it and

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.030 
they've probably gotten bored of it and
stopped<00:05:58.210> playing<00:05:58.450> it<00:05:58.720> and<00:05:58.840> then<00:05:59.710> they<00:05:59.800> want<00:05:59.980> to

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:00.040
