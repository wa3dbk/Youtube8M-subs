00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
let's play for this but unfortunately

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.139 
let's play for this but unfortunately
I'm<00:00:48.989> not<00:00:49.020> going<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.649> be<00:00:49.739> able<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.370> was

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
I'm not going to be able to I was

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.549 
I'm not going to be able to I was
thinking<00:00:51.510> about<00:00:51.600> just<00:00:51.899> doing<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.289> let's<00:00:52.440> play

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
thinking about just doing a let's play

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.340 
thinking about just doing a let's play
over<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.430> normal<00:00:54.329> gameplay<00:00:54.570> like<00:00:54.930> such<00:00:55.199> as

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
over the normal gameplay like such as

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.639 
over the normal gameplay like such as
this<00:00:55.530> but<00:00:56.399> unfortunately<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:57.270> think<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:58.020> it

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
this but unfortunately I think that it

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.290 
this but unfortunately I think that it
just<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:59.039> just<00:00:59.070> wouldn't<00:00:59.520> make<00:00:59.609> any<00:00:59.789> sense<00:00:59.879> you

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
just it just wouldn't make any sense you

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.760 
just it just wouldn't make any sense you
need<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.539> have<00:01:00.690> cutscenes<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.410> need<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.649> have

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
need to have cutscenes you need to have

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.889 
need to have cutscenes you need to have
the<00:01:01.949> storyline<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:03.059> be<00:01:03.149> feeling<00:01:03.390> fully

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
the storyline to be feeling fully

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.410 
the storyline to be feeling fully
engrossed<00:01:04.260> into<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.090> so<00:01:06.090> we're<00:01:06.210> not<00:01:06.270> gonna

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
engrossed into it and so we're not gonna

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.380 
engrossed into it and so we're not gonna
be<00:01:06.510> able<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.689> do<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:07.010> so<00:01:08.010> but<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.790> mean<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.330> do
