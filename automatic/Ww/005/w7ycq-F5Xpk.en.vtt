00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:03.749
 a piece of meat on the plate belongs to many Germans 

00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:06.720
 Just eat it but not for everyone 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.000
 Millions of vegetarians in Germany quite deliberately do not eat any animal 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.910
 That's why they do not have to be hungry for products 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:18.800
 The many foods often contain parts of slaughter animals in it without 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.980
 that this is noted on the packaging 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.090
 Uncovered Dairy Fruit Juices Beet soup or sweets everywhere 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.360
 Hidden percent meat products are our service 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.170
 Therefore, bring a little light Enz ingredients today 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.570
 Michel Carnal is a vegetarian of one of six million Germans 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.400
 she avoids meat and fish feeds herself and her family on potatoes 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.860
 cool and dairy products 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.930
 There are lots of vegetables and fruits 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.490
 Sounds easy is a purchase Rangers was always on the 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.500
 Vortage Westgartshausen because you do not know exactly if he is the ZDF 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.470
 Animal ingredients are quite elaborate from Dyson's purchasing department 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.530
 takes longer 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.630
 the problem 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.930
 Not every product you would initially suspect it would be 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.960
 Guitar shit actually is free of animal matter one circumstance ever 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.530
 after how detailed and Germany have to adapt again and again 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.990
 we stopped hidden pork lard about it 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.650
 then also Stella Thiel drained from bone and percent animal skins 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:22.590
 something similar is found in quite a few products 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.680
 the cradle part do not know then of course calves love for the 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.320
 Making cheese partly also gives me eggs or similar products 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.520
 used for thinking but not necessarily classified 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.290
 As he accompanied Maike Cana in the supermarket, we quickly became vegetarian 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.070
 shopping 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.780
 this is actually a tedious task 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.760
 Believe for example are fried in pork lard and only on 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.990
 In very few supermarkets, there are still specially marked with the act 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.750
 nothing to prepare 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.910
 the same the cripo in Soest future read word for word always that 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.510
 Fine print then you can find lard free Grauduszus 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.110
 and another example from the breakfast area meter by muesli 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.080
 and in the middle of it a product that is particularly healthy and full of fiber 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.359
 List of ingredients Jan Dirk Thieme finds 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:16.519
 a genius made out of connective tissue Conrad sometimes 

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:22.239
 Speaking of gelatin what very few people know about this substance is considered by many 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.269
 To explain to manufacturers of fruit juices used 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.369
 and also sect are often cleaned with gelatin from adhesives 

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:32.529
 that does not have to be expelled 

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:36.359
 The animal connective tissue is also very popular with Schaaf 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:40.149
 Fat is saved in quartz and fresh dumplings 

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:43.259
 and even in yoghurts there is Celle Tine 

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:48.129
 on the one hand, we demand of politics 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:52.170
 these are the terms vegetarian and vegan quite clearly define and also 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:52.999
 protect 

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:57.059
 which, so to speak, really helped percent products or the right Digital Seagate 

00:02:57.059 --> 00:03:00.059
 The guitar also agrees with Jack MA that it too 

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:03.479
 really something that politics can do relatively easily you both have 

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:06.799
 Pirogue goat, for example, and you could do exactly the same 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.959
 also gone with the term vegetarian 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.359
 Maike Connor knows all these problems and still fails again and again 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.189
 Example tomato soup 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:17.189
 the red fruit at the front and the ingredients list at the back 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:23.169
 but also with soups and sauces with patience and good eyes she can 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:25.999
 find the while vegetable soup 

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:27.339
 the problem though 

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:28.340
 every company 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.340
 marks their vegetarian products 

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:38.349
 That reads the report wants to become something that shows you in daily life 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:39.939
 Years of a simple one 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:44.489
 with a speech therapist or a victory forth what was on the packaging woman on him 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.040
 to clearly identify who it is Nettetal the product 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.619
 Sausage and meat fall for Maike grains Uli Knauss but what remains is 

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:53.139
 to enter the whole crisis 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:53.869
 not more 

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:57.619
 most of the crisis, the animals should use one of the Nat 

00:03:57.619 --> 00:04:00.139
 Stomach dead calves would be prepared 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:04.040
 In the well-stocked Martin Bartek looking for alternatives explained Rolf 

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.949
 Hellgardt 

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:07.739
 I have my job watching TV 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.739
 then a biogas plant 

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:14.429
 how are the animals stranded gates 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:18.900
 if he himself is required in it 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.430
 the Bund 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.000
 and there remains the purchase of vegetables 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.090
 with readers canned or frozen but here it is called for vegetarians completely 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.420
 It is not that easy 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.890
 you have to be careful 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.150
 I had the raccoon 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.680
 Red Cross helper Red cabbage had therefore the interest to see that he 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.150
 White 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.180
 Heike Corner had learned one thing from all these experiences 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.380
 she can rely on herself and her cooking skills most of all 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.360
 So I personally also committed heavily processed foods 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.169
 lived by Martens from Rostock filter 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:56.199
 because if not now the parents had prepared it themselves know that at 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:59.509
 I do not expect it to be nearly ten percent right after 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:00.499
 last choice 

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:05.389
 The conclusion after a long shopping in the supermarket digital life but it works 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:08.719
 for Maike KÃ¶rner and all the other people who are Bruni animal 

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:11.990
 To feed products costs time and attention 

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:14.699
 it is more complicated 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:15.459
 as it should be
