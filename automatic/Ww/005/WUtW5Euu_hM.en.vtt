00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.820
 it is harmful because it is a 100% predatory animal 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.040
 if this is a threat to the other species having calamaro but there will be 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.769
 other bad fish species very difficult because 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.029
 do not leave us do not let the other animals take it ten charitable 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:16.079
 because after 

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:20.469
 we enter economy in the whole body and it is a dish a lot of joy is very rich 

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:25.489
 the channels that in a pair of cellular side fins that use like 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:28.130
 stabilizers when naught 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.939
 the mantle wall is formed by our muscle fibers that 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.990
 allow you to contract and relax to drink water and expel them formally and 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.700
 strong jets farc its expulsion 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.300
 so he moved at great speed 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.190
 squid considered as the invertebrate more than what exists 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.630
 be not 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:48.840
 while fishing 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.589
 the squid struggles to escape 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:53.479
 so I spit sip of water tried to propel myself 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:57.109
 but before the posterity the only thing that achieves spain burns to the neck inta 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.370
 rent capture 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.000
 the squid fishery 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.570
 It is one of the most difficult 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.260
 and more dangerous 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
 today the risk they represent 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.260
 nothing more dangerous 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
 and other relatives 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.420
 rosemary 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.160
 asked why I will not be able to 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.960
 from the fear of getting windy 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.380
 and the problem is that if you are and that a finger is not the squid spot 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.650
 because it seems very dangerous because it kills me can erase 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.409
 two among them seven with which he tells that they are like his boyfriend's piranhas 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.900
 this is so in cameras and that is a 100% predator what is there 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.250
 and what moves 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.310
 I take it without zeal to who changes color depends 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.319
 the shareholder his status 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:01.840
 if it is hosted 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.450
 is it depends if you take it out of the sea it gets white it's supposed to be red 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.450
 that has the ink because it is a defensive medium before the octopus 

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:11.630
 the squids like the others are the funds 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.080
 has the property to change color almost instantaneously 

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:20.160
 this is possible because their layers there are multitude of cells 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.659
 this already the so-called forums commands 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:27.069
 It does not contract, modifying the animal's healing, allowing it to 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.069
 hide and from your enemies 

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:37.400
 the item is a product with high nutritional value 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.900
 which was to benefit their 75 percent of edible parts 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.490
 after removing the viscera 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.220
 contains proteins such as albumin, vitamins and minerals 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.379
 like phosphorus 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.299
 the catch is handled fresh 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.849
 observing the frozen ice and dilating the compin the oils with 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.799
 these animals are prepared different wanted to be a variety of ways 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.499
 either alone or accompanied with other products such as rice 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:07.930
 finally in several countries it turns out to be one of the cheapest foods 

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:11.559
 the production of this species that is abundant in some seasons 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.329
 almost 300 tons are received daily 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.849
 In San Carlos there are not enough plants to process the product 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.450
 and a pledge scheme that allows fishermen to keep the product 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.939
 for times of scarcity 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:28.979
 so the majority of production is exported to Asian countries where it is 

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:34.170
 part of the daily consumption can be prepared e in service and even stern 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:35.160
 appearing 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.319
 both the head and the mantle 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:38.859
 for all that 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:41.829
 he's a doctor because it's all gibberish 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.929
 It is a very exquisite shellfish tanks that few people are approved 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.209
 they say no no no no no no do not know it 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:53.389
 so is this species 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:55.809
 mysterious strong and dangerous 

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:58.820
 natural predator that stalks everything in its path 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.600
 but it is also considered one of the most conflicting and exquisite products 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.759
 of international cuisine 

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:07.040
 one more expression 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.539
 This paradise between two seas Alejandro Cuíña 

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:12.089
 expressions of the capes
