shaker<00:00:42.240> loops<00:00:42.600> it's<00:00:43.230> written<00:00:43.500> for<00:00:43.710> string

shaker loops it's written for string

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.820 
shaker loops it's written for string
orchestra<00:00:44.130> and<00:00:44.640> he<00:00:44.850> exploits<00:00:45.630> all<00:00:46.380> the

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:46.830 
orchestra and he exploits all the

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.100 
orchestra and he exploits all the
possibilities<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.610> string<00:00:48.150> instruments<00:00:48.930> and

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
possibilities of string instruments and

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.049 
possibilities of string instruments and
the<00:00:49.620> reason<00:00:49.830> they<00:00:50.100> were<00:00:50.160> called<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.610> shakers

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
the reason they were called the shakers

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.299 
the reason they were called the shakers
is<00:00:51.270> because<00:00:51.600> when<00:00:51.809> they<00:00:51.989> had<00:00:52.559> their<00:00:52.800> religious

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
is because when they had their religious

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.400 
is because when they had their religious
ceremonies<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.330> their<00:00:54.750> their<00:00:55.110> group

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
ceremonies and their their group

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.160 
ceremonies and their their group
experiences<00:00:56.309> they<00:00:56.850> would<00:00:57.090> be<00:00:57.270> possessed<00:00:57.780> by

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
experiences they would be possessed by

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.440 
experiences they would be possessed by
these<00:00:58.489> religious<00:00:59.489> feelings<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.180> start

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.450 
these religious feelings and start

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.720 
these religious feelings and start
shaking<00:01:00.960> but<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.590> think<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:01.980> also<00:01:02.010> happens<00:01:02.610> in

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
shaking but I think it also happens in

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.700 
shaking but I think it also happens in
music<00:01:03.210> particularly<00:01:03.600> in<00:01:03.810> minimalism<00:01:04.320> when

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
music particularly in minimalism when

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.790 
music particularly in minimalism when
patterns<00:01:05.550> are<00:01:05.759> repeated<00:01:06.330> or<00:01:06.770> certain<00:01:07.770> types

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
of effects are repeated when you repeat

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.280 
of effects are repeated when you repeat
something<00:01:11.100> over<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:12.180> over<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.840> over<00:01:12.990> again

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
something over and over and over again

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.530 
something over and over and over again
it<00:01:14.250> can<00:01:14.550> be<00:01:15.020> hypnotic<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.430> the<00:01:17.430> end<00:01:17.759> result<00:01:18.360> is
