00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
with a bandsaw but yeah I built this

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.770 
with a bandsaw but yeah I built this
using<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.810> tremendous<00:01:28.500> trucks<00:01:28.829> book<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.780> I

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
using the tremendous trucks book and I

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.480 
using the tremendous trucks book and I
put<00:01:31.140> my<00:01:31.259> own<00:01:31.290> little<00:01:31.409> spin<00:01:31.650> on<00:01:31.979> some<00:01:32.250> things

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
put my own little spin on some things

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.710 
put my own little spin on some things
because<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:33.000> thought<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.270> would<00:01:33.390> look<00:01:33.509> better

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
because I thought it would look better

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.810 
because I thought it would look better
so<00:01:34.619> like<00:01:34.920> with<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.310> grill

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820

just looks better without it but it's
still<00:02:28.180> a<00:02:28.300> pretty<00:02:28.510> cool<00:02:28.780> little<00:02:28.900> piece<00:02:29.340> but<00:02:30.340> um
