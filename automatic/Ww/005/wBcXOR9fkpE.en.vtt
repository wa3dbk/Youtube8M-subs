to<00:00:40.649> be<00:00:40.739> quite<00:00:40.920> slow<00:00:41.309> for<00:00:41.340> these<00:00:41.610> scenes<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.149> any

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
to be quite slow for these scenes so any

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.910 
to be quite slow for these scenes so any
minor<00:00:42.750> motion<00:00:43.170> from<00:00:43.290> hand<00:00:43.590> holding<00:00:43.860> the

minor motion from hand holding the

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.560 
minor motion from hand holding the
camera<00:00:44.309> will<00:00:44.460> make<00:00:44.670> your<00:00:44.820> photos<00:00:45.149> look<00:00:45.239> like<00:00:45.539> a

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
camera will make your photos look like a

big<00:00:45.870> blurry<00:00:46.200> mess<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.460> key<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.730> getting

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
big blurry mess so the key to getting

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.700 
big blurry mess so the key to getting
cool<00:00:48.149> shots<00:00:48.450> with<00:00:48.690> moving<00:00:49.050> lights<00:00:49.260> like<00:00:49.530> this

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
cool shots with moving lights like this

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.790 
cool shots with moving lights like this
one<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.520> use<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.700> slow<00:00:51.149> shutter<00:00:51.570> speed<00:00:51.899> by

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
one is to use a slow shutter speed by

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.529 
one is to use a slow shutter speed by
leaving<00:00:53.129> your<00:00:53.219> shutter<00:00:53.430> open<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.120> headlights

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
leaving your shutter open the headlights

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.060 
leaving your shutter open the headlights
and<00:00:54.750> taillights<00:00:55.050> from<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.590> cars<00:00:55.800> are

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
and taillights from the cars are

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.799 
and taillights from the cars are
reported<00:00:56.550> as<00:00:56.670> they<00:00:56.850> pass<00:00:57.059> through<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.449> scene

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
reported as they pass through the scene

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.720 
reported as they pass through the scene
leaving<00:00:58.350> streaks<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:59.010> light<00:00:59.219> instead<00:00:59.550> of

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
leaving streaks of light instead of

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.540 
leaving streaks of light instead of
being<00:00:59.940> frozen<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.449> time<00:01:01.219> start<00:01:02.219> out<00:01:02.370> with<00:01:02.489> a

see<00:01:04.949> how<00:01:05.070> much<00:01:05.220> motion<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.760> get<00:01:05.960> adjust<00:01:06.960> up<00:01:07.110> or

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
see how much motion you get adjust up or

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.810 
see how much motion you get adjust up or
down<00:01:07.530> as<00:01:07.799> necessary<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.549> get<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.790> desired

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
really handy as you can set the shutter

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.700 
really handy as you can set the shutter
speed<00:01:14.820> yourself<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:16.020> camera<00:01:16.380> will<00:01:16.530> try

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
speed yourself and the camera will try

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.440 
speed yourself and the camera will try
to<00:01:16.740> guess<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.220> rest<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.729> parameters<00:01:17.909> for

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.080 
yellow lights one other thing to keep in
mind<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.860> cars<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.340> are<00:01:35.430> closer<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:36.000> you

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
mind is that cars that are closer to you

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.060 
mind is that cars that are closer to you
will<00:01:36.570> appear<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.990> move<00:01:37.140> faster<00:01:37.619> than<00:01:37.650> cars

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
will appear to move faster than cars

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.249 
will appear to move faster than cars
that<00:01:38.250> are<00:01:38.340> much<00:01:38.520> further<00:01:38.729> away<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.329> if<00:01:40.110> you're

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
that are much further away so if you're

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.690 
that are much further away so if you're
shooting<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.619> highway<00:01:40.950> from<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.250> great<00:01:41.520> distance

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
shooting a highway from a great distance

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.850 
shooting a highway from a great distance
you<00:01:42.090> might<00:01:42.240> need<00:01:42.390> an<00:01:42.540> extra<00:01:42.960> long<00:01:43.110> exposure<00:01:43.560> so

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
you might need an extra long exposure so

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.050 
you might need an extra long exposure so
that<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.159> appears<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.610> cars<00:01:44.790> are<00:01:44.939> actually

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
that it appears the cars are actually
