what's up guys I'm frisky and I'm
playing<00:00:04.920> some<00:00:05.690> 1v<00:00:06.690> one<00:00:07.140> on<00:00:07.410> rust<00:00:07.890> with<00:00:08.220> phase

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
playing some 1v one on rust with phase

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.549 
playing some 1v one on rust with phase
temper<00:00:09.120> and<00:00:10.610> yeah<00:00:11.610> I<00:00:12.059> did<00:00:12.900> a<00:00:12.929> lot<00:00:13.110> better<00:00:13.170> than

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
temper and yeah I did a lot better than

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.010 
temper and yeah I did a lot better than
I<00:00:13.620> thought<00:00:13.830> I<00:00:13.889> would<00:00:13.980> do<00:00:14.450> he<00:00:15.450> ended<00:00:15.630> up<00:00:15.809> winning

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
I thought I would do he ended up winning

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.420 
I thought I would do he ended up winning
but<00:00:16.980> I<00:00:17.539> let<00:00:18.539> him<00:00:18.660> win<00:00:18.900> because<00:00:19.170> I<00:00:19.770> thought

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
but I let him win because I thought

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.830 
but I let him win because I thought
would<00:00:20.520> be<00:00:20.580> good<00:00:20.789> if<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:21.000> let<00:00:21.210> him<00:00:21.330> keep<00:00:21.600> his

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
would be good if I let him keep his

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.710 
would be good if I let him keep his
confidence<00:00:22.470> level<00:00:22.830> up<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.310> if<00:00:24.150> I<00:00:24.269> beat<00:00:24.570> him

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
confidence level up is if I beat him

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.960 
confidence level up is if I beat him
then<00:00:24.960> he'd<00:00:25.500> sort<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:25.920> be<00:00:25.980> depressed<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.760> I

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
then he'd sort of be depressed and I

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.419 
then he'd sort of be depressed and I
think<00:00:27.840> he<00:00:27.990> would<00:00:28.140> quit<00:00:28.320> quickscoping<00:00:29.189> and

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
think he would quit quickscoping and

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.939 
think he would quit quickscoping and
trickshotting<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:31.349> wouldn't<00:00:31.619> want<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.800> do

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.590 
trickshotting and I wouldn't want to do
that<00:00:31.980> because<00:00:32.430> he's<00:00:32.730> like<00:00:32.850> bleeder<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.420> phase

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.900 
that because he's like bleeder of phase
and<00:00:33.899> I<00:00:33.930> didn't<00:00:34.170> want<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.410> ruin<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:35.520> for<00:00:35.670> all
