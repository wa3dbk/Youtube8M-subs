00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.770
 when you start streaming most themes 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.870

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:13.920
 from dap audio microphone stand 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.710
 I picked up a microphone from a box 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.810
 mxl 990 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.840

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.150
 do you need a phantom power so one 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.560
 kind of compressor calls lacquers and see if 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.759
 filter that needs replacing so you 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.420

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.310
 sound and michelle 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.189

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:45.000

 watch this is a led led screen 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.369
 they are better for the environment but still 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.290
 I am much more a fan of LCD screens 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.579
 just because light say you have 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.060
 I do not reflect that sometimes 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.119

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.490

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.110
 button 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.110

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:29.330
 yes start by accident and then you go 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:34.640

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.050
