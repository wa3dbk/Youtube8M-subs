during<00:00:05.250> this<00:00:05.400> demonstration<00:00:06.029> we<00:00:06.270> are<00:00:06.330> going

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
during this demonstration we are going

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.059 
during this demonstration we are going
to<00:00:06.690> experience<00:00:07.109> how<00:00:07.230> quick<00:00:07.500> and<00:00:07.620> easy<00:00:07.799> it<00:00:07.980> is

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
to experience how quick and easy it is

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.980 
to experience how quick and easy it is
to<00:00:08.130> get<00:00:08.429> documents<00:00:08.970> into<00:00:09.179> SharePoint<00:00:09.630> using

knowledge lay capture we start by

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.999 
knowledge lay capture we start by
choosing<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.630> scan<00:00:12.929> one<00:00:13.110> page<00:00:13.170> for<00:00:13.620> document

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
choosing to scan one page for document

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.980 
choosing to scan one page for document
to<00:00:14.400> show<00:00:14.549> you<00:00:14.610> how<00:00:14.849> quickly<00:00:15.120> we<00:00:15.360> can<00:00:15.509> tag<00:00:15.750> or

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
to show you how quickly we can tag or

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.260 
to show you how quickly we can tag or
index<00:00:16.350> five<00:00:16.949> separate<00:00:17.369> documents<00:00:17.910> in<00:00:18.029> quick
