where<00:03:05.050> we're<00:03:05.950> vibrating<00:03:06.300> at<00:03:07.300> about<00:03:07.690> almost

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
where we're vibrating at about almost

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.620 
where we're vibrating at about almost
fourth<00:03:08.650> dimension<00:03:09.190> now<00:03:09.340> we're<00:03:10.090> moving<00:03:10.300> into

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
fourth dimension now we're moving into

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.900 
fourth dimension now we're moving into
the<00:03:10.780> fifth<00:03:10.990> dimension<00:03:11.080> and<00:03:11.770> we're<00:03:12.490> able<00:03:12.670> to

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
the fifth dimension and we're able to

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.960 
the fifth dimension and we're able to
see<00:03:13.150> ships<00:03:13.540> more<00:03:14.140> and<00:03:14.350> more<00:03:14.530> and<00:03:14.680> more<00:03:14.970> because

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
see ships more and more and more because

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.300 
see ships more and more and more because
not<00:03:16.870> being<00:03:17.110> able<00:03:17.260> to<00:03:17.410> see<00:03:17.650> the<00:03:17.770> ships<00:03:18.010> has

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
not being able to see the ships has

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.490 
not being able to see the ships has
never<00:03:18.550> been<00:03:18.730> a<00:03:18.790> matter<00:03:19.120> of<00:03:19.360> the<00:03:19.750> star<00:03:20.050> nations

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
never been a matter of the star nations

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.860 
never been a matter of the star nations
cloaking<00:03:21.220> themselves<00:03:21.430> it's<00:03:22.390> been<00:03:22.600> a<00:03:22.630> matter

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
cloaking themselves it's been a matter

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.420 
cloaking themselves it's been a matter
of<00:03:23.080> us<00:03:23.680> cloaking<00:03:24.610> ourselves<00:03:25.210> we<00:03:25.960> are<00:03:26.440> clicking

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
of us cloaking ourselves we are clicking

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.550 
of us cloaking ourselves we are clicking
ourselves<00:03:28.000> we<00:03:28.300> have<00:03:28.540> had<00:03:28.720> those<00:03:28.930> veils<00:03:29.260> of

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
ourselves we have had those veils of

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.340 
ourselves we have had those veils of
illusion<00:03:30.100> across<00:03:30.460> our<00:03:30.670> mind<00:03:31.060> and<00:03:31.450> it<00:03:32.020> been<00:03:32.200> at

illusion across our mind and it been at

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.500 
illusion across our mind and it been at
such<00:03:32.620> a<00:03:32.650> low<00:03:32.890> frequency<00:03:33.100> we<00:03:34.090> haven't<00:03:34.450> been

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
such a low frequency we haven't been

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.140 
such a low frequency we haven't been
able<00:03:34.600> to<00:03:34.780> see<00:03:35.170> these<00:03:35.410> things<00:03:35.740> and<00:03:36.100> now<00:03:36.700> all<00:03:36.970> of

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
able to see these things and now all of

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.660 
able to see these things and now all of
a<00:03:37.240> sudden<00:03:37.660> it<00:03:37.780> looks<00:03:38.050> like<00:03:38.320> there's<00:03:38.670> thousands

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
a sudden it looks like there's thousands

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.790 
a sudden it looks like there's thousands
and<00:03:39.850> thousands<00:03:40.540> more<00:03:40.600> sightings<00:03:41.290> and

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
and thousands more sightings and

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.620 
and thousands more sightings and
contacts<00:03:42.340> happening<00:03:42.910> all<00:03:43.060> over<00:03:43.090> the<00:03:43.420> world

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
contacts happening all over the world

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.710 
contacts happening all over the world
when<00:03:44.500> in<00:03:44.650> reality<00:03:44.860> our<00:03:45.490> consciousness<00:03:46.480> is

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
when in reality our consciousness is

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.110 
when in reality our consciousness is
increasing<00:03:47.530> to<00:03:47.740> the<00:03:47.830> point<00:03:48.160> where<00:03:48.400> we<00:03:48.550> can<00:03:48.790> see

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
increasing to the point where we can see

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.140 
increasing to the point where we can see
what<00:03:49.690> was<00:03:49.870> already<00:03:50.110> there<00:03:50.590> and<00:03:51.160> we<00:03:51.880> can

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
what was already there and we can

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.290 
what was already there and we can
remember<00:03:53.020> and<00:03:53.260> stay<00:03:53.680> conscious<00:03:54.010> for<00:03:54.880> what<00:03:55.120> is

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
remember and stay conscious for what is

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.530 
remember and stay conscious for what is
already<00:03:55.780> happening<00:03:56.490> they've<00:03:57.490> had<00:03:57.850> contact

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
already happening they've had contact

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.720 
already happening they've had contact
with<00:03:58.810> thousands<00:03:59.650> and<00:03:59.770> thousands<00:04:00.220> of<00:04:00.310> people

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
with thousands and thousands of people

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.470 
with thousands and thousands of people
consistently<00:04:01.600> throughout<00:04:02.530> time<00:04:03.150> but<00:04:04.150> we<00:04:04.300> are

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
consistently throughout time but we are

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.190 
consistently throughout time but we are
not<00:04:04.660> able<00:04:04.840> to<00:04:05.110> remember<00:04:05.470> that<00:04:05.970> often<00:04:06.970> so<00:04:07.200> the

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
not able to remember that often so the

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.650 
not able to remember that often so the
contact<00:04:08.709> workshop<00:04:09.310> is<00:04:09.610> going<00:04:10.120> to<00:04:10.209> take<00:04:10.480> you

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
contact workshop is going to take you

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.630 
contact workshop is going to take you
through<00:04:10.690> these<00:04:11.080> four<00:04:11.410> stages<00:04:11.800> of<00:04:12.100> contact

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
through these four stages of contact

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.330 
through these four stages of contact
dream<00:04:13.330> state<00:04:13.630> a<00:04:13.810> sirak<00:04:14.230> out-of-body<00:04:14.980> and

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
dream state a sirak out-of-body and

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.760 
dream state a sirak out-of-body and
finally<00:04:15.970> physical<00:04:16.630> you're<00:04:17.230> going<00:04:17.440> to<00:04:17.560> learn

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:17.770 
finally physical you're going to learn

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:20.159 
finally physical you're going to learn
how<00:04:17.830> to<00:04:18.070> call<00:04:18.400> in<00:04:18.580> the<00:04:18.609> ship's<00:04:19.169> establish

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
how to call in the ship's establish

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.409 
how to call in the ship's establish
clear<00:04:20.760> communication<00:04:21.760> with<00:04:21.970> the<00:04:22.090> star<00:04:22.390> beings

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
clear communication with the star beings

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.830 
clear communication with the star beings
and<00:04:23.050> really<00:04:23.919> move<00:04:24.250> towards<00:04:25.060> full<00:04:25.360> physical

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
and really move towards full physical

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.370 
and really move towards full physical
