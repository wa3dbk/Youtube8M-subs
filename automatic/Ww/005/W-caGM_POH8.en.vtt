had some nude may be set plays but the

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.289 
had some nude may be set plays but the
true<00:01:07.770> base<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.340> feel<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.790> game<00:01:08.820> didn't

really<00:01:09.540> change<00:01:09.780> if<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:11.220> think<00:01:11.400> from<00:01:11.729> rugby

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
really change if you think from rugby

really change if you think from rugby
challenge<00:01:12.330> directly<00:01:12.900> challenged<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.610> are<00:01:14.610> we

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
challenge directly challenged to are we

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.620 
challenge directly challenged to are we
the<00:01:15.270> base<00:01:15.570> was<00:01:16.470> very<00:01:16.890> similar<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.630> the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
the base was very similar and the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.469 
the base was very similar and the
gameplay<00:01:19.110> just<00:01:19.700> innovated<00:01:20.700> on<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:21.150> and

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
gameplay just innovated on that and

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.810 
gameplay just innovated on that and
that's<00:01:22.170> what<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.799> think<00:01:23.189> reg<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.490> challenge

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
that's what I think reg you challenge

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.249 
that's what I think reg you challenge
three<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.060> going<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.330> be<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.750> base<00:01:24.930> is

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
three is going to be the base is

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.719 
three is going to be the base is
fundamentally<00:01:26.009> going<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.250> be<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.460> right<00:01:26.580> be

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
fundamentally going to be the right be

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.160 
fundamentally going to be the right be
challenge<00:01:27.119> series<00:01:27.420> it's<00:01:27.780> going<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:27.990> have

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
challenge series it's going to have

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.920 
challenge series it's going to have
almost<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.009> exact<00:01:29.310> same<00:01:29.340> gameplay<00:01:29.759> star<00:01:30.210> very

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
almost the exact same gameplay star very

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.469 
almost the exact same gameplay star very
similar<00:01:31.320> animations<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.270> probably<00:01:33.270> very

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
similar animations and probably very

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.830 
similar animations and probably very
similar<00:01:33.900> controls<00:01:35.180> but<00:01:36.180> what<00:01:36.420> we<00:01:36.570> must

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
similar controls but what we must

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.569 
similar controls but what we must
remember<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.409> they're<00:01:37.740> going<00:01:38.220> tell

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
remember is that they're going tell

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.280 
remember is that they're going tell
they're<00:01:39.000> going<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.270> be<00:01:39.329> balancing<00:01:39.840> stuff<00:01:40.079> out

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
they're going to be balancing stuff out

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.399 
they're going to be balancing stuff out
so<00:01:40.950> they're<00:01:41.250> going<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.520> be<00:01:41.640> because<00:01:42.409> people

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
so they're going to be because people

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.660 
so they're going to be because people
complain<00:01:43.710> about<00:01:43.829> offloads<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.520> rugby

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
complain about offloads and rugby

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.580 
complain about offloads and rugby
challenge<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.329> they'll<00:01:45.840> probably<00:01:45.869> tone<00:01:46.439> that

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
challenge to they'll probably tone that

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.260 
challenge to they'll probably tone that
down<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:47.009> me<00:01:47.100> they're<00:01:47.340> probably<00:01:47.490> going<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.030> try

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
down to me they're probably going to try

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.080 
down to me they're probably going to try
and<00:01:48.299> balance<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.810> game<00:01:48.960> as<00:01:49.170> well<00:01:49.290> as<00:01:49.470> they<00:01:49.590> can

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
and balance a game as well as they can

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.569 
and balance a game as well as they can
to<00:01:51.090> feel<00:01:51.360> like<00:01:51.630> rugby<00:01:51.869> challenge<00:01:52.229> but<00:01:53.220> also<00:01:53.369> to

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
to feel like rugby challenge but also to

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.510 
to feel like rugby challenge but also to
feel<00:01:53.880> like<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.060> new<00:01:54.270> game<00:01:54.450> as<00:01:54.600> well<00:01:54.890> I'm<00:01:55.890> not

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
feel like a new game as well I'm not

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.590 
feel like a new game as well I'm not
really<00:01:56.670> concerned<00:01:56.909> about<00:01:57.149> their<00:01:57.420> being

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
really concerned about their being

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.389 
really concerned about their being
recycled<00:01:58.079> because<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.590> actually<00:01:58.740> enjoy<00:01:59.250> the

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
recycled because I actually enjoy the

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.069 
recycled because I actually enjoy the
rugby<00:01:59.670> challenge<00:01:59.850> gameplay<00:02:00.420> but<00:02:00.780> as<00:02:00.899> long<00:02:01.049> as

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
rugby challenge gameplay but as long as

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.350 
rugby challenge gameplay but as long as
offloads<00:02:01.619> were<00:02:01.950> toned<00:02:02.250> down<00:02:02.460> maybe<00:02:03.119> the

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
offloads were toned down maybe the

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.149 
offloads were toned down maybe the
kicking<00:02:03.719> styles<00:02:04.170> change<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.740> stuff<00:02:04.950> like

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
kicking styles change and stuff like

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.010 
kicking styles change and stuff like
that<00:02:05.219> there's<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.610> few<00:02:05.820> things<00:02:05.969> that<00:02:06.210> we<00:02:06.420> know

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
that there's a few things that we know

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.339 
that there's a few things that we know
will<00:02:07.170> be<00:02:07.229> chair<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:08.190> want<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.640> be<00:02:08.729> changed

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
will be chair that I want to be changed

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.869 
will be chair that I want to be changed
but<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.470> must<00:02:10.709> understand<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.370> rugby

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
regular challenges so for me this isn't

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.920 
regular challenges so for me this isn't
that<00:02:32.220> concern<00:02:32.580> I'm<00:02:32.820> interested<00:02:33.810> in<00:02:33.870> seeing

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
that concern I'm interested in seeing

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.530 
that concern I'm interested in seeing
how<00:02:34.740> sevens<00:02:35.490> animations<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.210> stuff<00:02:36.360> will

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
how sevens animations and stuff will

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.420 
how sevens animations and stuff will
differ<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:37.350> know<00:02:37.500> because<00:02:38.220> it's<00:02:38.370> a

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
differ you know because it's a

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.890 
differ you know because it's a
completely<00:02:38.730> different<00:02:39.090> game<00:02:39.120> rugby<00:02:39.540> sevens

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
completely different game rugby sevens

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.080 
completely different game rugby sevens
it's<00:02:40.200> all<00:02:40.260> about<00:02:40.290> pace<00:02:40.800> and<00:02:41.160> you<00:02:41.610> know<00:02:41.730> space

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
it's all about pace and you know space

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.310 
it's all about pace and you know space
and<00:02:42.300> all<00:02:42.390> that<00:02:42.540> sort<00:02:42.720> of<00:02:42.840> stuff<00:02:42.900> I'm

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
and all that sort of stuff I'm

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.370 
and all that sort of stuff I'm
interested<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.830> see<00:02:43.890> how<00:02:44.100> rugby<00:02:44.490> 15<00:02:45.380> the

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
interested to see how rugby 15 the

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.020 
interested to see how rugby 15 the
gameplay<00:02:46.800> will<00:02:46.980> differ<00:02:47.160> from<00:02:47.310> rugby<00:02:47.520> sevens

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
gameplay will differ from rugby sevens

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.760 
gameplay will differ from rugby sevens
but<00:02:48.240> I'm<00:02:48.330> not<00:02:48.570> really<00:02:48.720> concerned<00:02:48.960> there's<00:02:49.710> a

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
but I'm not really concerned there's a

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.270 
but I'm not really concerned there's a
regular<00:02:50.100> challenge<00:02:50.460> three<00:02:50.700> game<00:02:51.170> being

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
regular challenge three game being

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.800 
regular challenge three game being
fundamentally<00:02:53.280> recycled<00:02:54.180> I<00:02:54.270> think<00:02:54.540> will<00:02:54.660> be

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
fundamentally recycled I think will be

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.500 
fundamentally recycled I think will be
very<00:02:54.990> very<00:02:55.590> similar<00:02:55.950> in<00:02:56.300> animations<00:02:57.300> and

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
very very similar in animations and

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.270 
very very similar in animations and
stuff<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:58.430> probably<00:02:59.430> gameplay<00:03:00.180> stuff<00:03:01.140> but<00:03:02.070> I

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
stuff and probably gameplay stuff but I

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.630 
stuff and probably gameplay stuff but I
think<00:03:02.670> will<00:03:03.030> be<00:03:03.150> enough<00:03:03.570> in<00:03:03.840> there<00:03:04.530> for<00:03:04.740> to<00:03:05.490> be

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
think will be enough in there for to be

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.240 
think will be enough in there for to be
refreshed<00:03:06.030> but<00:03:06.930> anyway<00:03:07.230> we're<00:03:07.680> striving<00:03:07.980> for

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
refreshed but anyway we're striving for

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.190 
refreshed but anyway we're striving for
a<00:03:08.280> good<00:03:08.490> rugby<00:03:08.670> game<00:03:08.940> especially<00:03:09.150> on<00:03:09.630> next-gen

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
a good rugby game especially on next-gen

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.680 
a good rugby game especially on next-gen

like rugby challenge 3 might be that

like rugby challenge 3 might be that
it's<00:03:24.180> probably<00:03:24.570> not<00:03:24.840> going<00:03:24.930> to<00:03:24.990> be<00:03:25.050> perfect
