00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.120 
down which really is a plus I don't know
how<00:02:30.480> long<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.870> court<00:02:31.110> is<00:02:31.230> because<00:02:31.590> since<00:02:31.950> I've

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
how long the court is because since I've

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.310 
how long the court is because since I've
owned<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.460> I've<00:02:32.550> never<00:02:32.910> undone<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:33.780> cord<00:02:34.080> so

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
owned it I've never undone the cord so

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.350 
owned it I've never undone the cord so
it's<00:02:35.100> been<00:02:35.250> like<00:02:35.430> this<00:02:35.580> since<00:02:35.640> I<00:02:35.970> got<00:02:36.150> it<00:02:38.360> 10

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
it's been like this since I got it 10

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.030 
it's been like this since I got it 10
amps<00:02:39.750> yes<00:02:39.960> yes<00:02:40.200> I<00:02:40.290> already<00:02:40.380> said<00:02:40.620> that<00:02:40.800> let<00:02:41.010> me

zoom in on the sticker so you guys can
see<00:02:43.760> 10<00:02:44.760> amps<00:02:45.090> right<00:02:45.660> there<00:02:46.400> um<00:02:47.780> 4<00:02:48.780> and<00:02:48.870> a<00:02:48.900> half

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
see 10 amps right there um 4 and a half

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.970 
see 10 amps right there um 4 and a half
inch<00:02:50.330> if<00:02:51.330> you<00:02:51.810> didn't<00:02:52.020> hear<00:02:52.140> me<00:02:52.260> that<00:02:52.470> already

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.000 

but<00:02:55.980> very<00:02:56.430> solderless<00:02:57.530> solidly<00:02:58.530> built<00:02:58.710> tool

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
but very solderless solidly built tool

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.070 
but very solderless solidly built tool
it's<00:02:59.610> got<00:02:59.820> this<00:02:59.970> dust<00:03:00.330> port<00:03:00.630> right<00:03:00.810> here<00:03:00.840> in

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
it's got this dust port right here in

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.670 
it's got this dust port right here in
the<00:03:01.200> back<00:03:01.410> so<00:03:01.440> that<00:03:01.920> when<00:03:02.760> you're<00:03:02.940> grinding

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
the back so that when you're grinding

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.860 
the back so that when you're grinding
all<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:05.310> dust<00:03:06.120> and<00:03:06.360> that<00:03:06.570> would

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
all the dust and that would

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.220 
all the dust and that would
regularly<00:03:07.550> kill<00:03:08.550> the<00:03:08.670> motor<00:03:08.900> leaves<00:03:09.900> out<00:03:10.110> the

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
regularly kill the motor leaves out the

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.410 
regularly kill the motor leaves out the
back<00:03:10.410> here<00:03:10.740> and<00:03:10.920> you<00:03:10.980> can<00:03:11.790> see<00:03:12.150> in<00:03:12.240> there<00:03:12.390> that

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
back here and you can see in there that

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.070 
back here and you can see in there that
it's<00:03:12.690> quite<00:03:13.350> dirty<00:03:14.210> but<00:03:15.210> you<00:03:15.450> can<00:03:15.630> see<00:03:15.810> how<00:03:15.930> my

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
it's quite dirty but you can see how my

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.010 
it's quite dirty but you can see how my
tool<00:03:16.320> is<00:03:16.530> really<00:03:16.800> dirty<00:03:17.130> yeah<00:03:17.880> so<00:03:18.240> when<00:03:18.900> you're

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
tool is really dirty yeah so when you're

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.530 
tool is really dirty yeah so when you're
grinding<00:03:19.200> there's<00:03:20.010> a<00:03:20.070> shitload<00:03:20.340> of<00:03:20.520> dust<00:03:20.790> but

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
grinding there's a shitload of dust but

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.070 
grinding there's a shitload of dust but
uh<00:03:21.570> oh<00:03:23.250> it's<00:03:23.790> kind<00:03:24.060> of<00:03:24.120> hard<00:03:24.480> to<00:03:24.600> fit

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
uh oh it's kind of hard to fit

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.650 
uh oh it's kind of hard to fit
everything<00:03:25.410> in<00:03:25.650> this<00:03:25.770> case<00:03:26.100> I<00:03:26.520> mean<00:03:27.510> you've

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
everything in this case I mean you've

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.460 
everything in this case I mean you've
got<00:03:27.840> to<00:03:27.960> jam<00:03:28.320> the<00:03:28.530> frickin<00:03:28.920> cord<00:03:29.190> in<00:03:29.310> there<00:03:29.550> and

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
got to jam the frickin cord in there and

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.150 
got to jam the frickin cord in there and
uh<00:03:32.990> so<00:03:33.990> I<00:03:34.020> wish<00:03:34.230> they<00:03:34.380> would<00:03:34.530> have<00:03:34.560> given<00:03:34.830> us<00:03:35.040> a

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
uh so I wish they would have given us a

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.450 
uh so I wish they would have given us a
bigger<00:03:35.400> case<00:03:35.850> but<00:03:36.330> the<00:03:37.110> tool<00:03:37.830> that's<00:03:38.070> inside<00:03:38.430> I

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460 
bigger case but the tool that's inside I

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.340 
bigger case but the tool that's inside I
guess<00:03:38.670> is<00:03:38.910> all<00:03:39.060> that<00:03:39.210> matters<00:03:39.540> because<00:03:39.870> it<00:03:40.170> is

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
guess is all that matters because it is

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.280 
guess is all that matters because it is
one<00:03:40.650> hell<00:03:40.920> of<00:03:40.950> a<00:03:41.220> tool<00:03:41.430> and<00:03:41.900> then<00:03:42.900> you<00:03:42.930> got<00:03:43.170> to

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
one hell of a tool and then you got to

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.240 
one hell of a tool and then you got to
try<00:03:43.620> to<00:03:43.710> fit<00:03:44.130> that<00:03:44.370> in<00:03:44.550> there<00:03:44.700> somehow<00:03:45.000> oh<00:03:46.220> wow

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
try to fit that in there somehow oh wow

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.170 
try to fit that in there somehow oh wow
closed<00:03:47.700> this<00:03:48.090> time<00:03:48.330> sort<00:03:48.930> of<00:03:48.990> it<00:03:49.770> goes<00:03:50.010> but<00:03:51.000> um

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
closed this time sort of it goes but um

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.150 
closed this time sort of it goes but um
good<00:03:51.780> case<00:03:52.020> you<00:03:52.260> can<00:03:52.410> get<00:03:52.530> a<00:03:52.560> little<00:03:52.740> lock<00:03:52.980> on

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
good case you can get a little lock on

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.670 
good case you can get a little lock on
there<00:03:53.370> don't<00:03:53.940> know<00:03:54.060> what<00:03:54.150> its<00:03:54.270> gonna<00:03:54.330> do<00:03:54.680> as

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
for a good angle grinder this thing was

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.640 
for a good angle grinder this thing was
a<00:04:04.560> like<00:04:05.400> a<00:04:05.430> hundred<00:04:05.820> bucks<00:04:06.030> at<00:04:06.900> Sears<00:04:07.350> so<00:04:07.590> you
