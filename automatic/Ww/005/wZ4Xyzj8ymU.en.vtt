00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
like the thick version of this because

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.650

it<00:00:24.060> goes<00:00:24.269> on<00:00:24.600> doesn't<00:00:25.380> run<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:26.220> can<00:00:27.180> cover<00:00:27.420> this

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
it goes on doesn't run I can cover this

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.070 
it goes on doesn't run I can cover this
one<00:00:28.080> side<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.490> entire<00:00:29.849> bottom<00:00:30.420> not<00:00:30.810> have

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
one side and the entire bottom not have

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.540 
one side and the entire bottom not have
to<00:00:31.260> worry<00:00:31.439> about<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.920> running

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
to worry about it running

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.840 
to worry about it running
then<00:00:33.149> I<00:00:33.300> take<00:00:33.540> their<00:00:33.989> UV<00:00:34.500> light<00:00:34.770> find<00:00:35.730> the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
then I take their UV light find the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.970 
then I take their UV light find the
button<00:00:36.210> turn<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.600> on<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:36.960> with<00:00:37.110> one<00:00:37.320> finger<00:00:37.649> I

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
button turn it on and with one finger I

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.200 
button turn it on and with one finger I
can<00:00:39.260> put<00:00:40.260> in<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.680> concentrated<00:00:41.460> beam<00:00:41.820> on<00:00:42.030> that

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
can put in a concentrated beam on that

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.650 
can put in a concentrated beam on that
versus<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:43.020> wider<00:00:43.800> beam<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.969> can<00:00:45.030> see<00:00:45.390> how<00:00:45.600> that

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
versus a wider beam you can see how that

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.080 
versus a wider beam you can see how that
works<00:00:46.020> now<00:00:46.410> that's<00:00:47.219> set<00:00:47.520> up<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.820> where<00:00:48.000> it

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
works now that's set up to where it

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.139 
works now that's set up to where it
won't<00:00:48.210> run<00:00:49.010> and<00:00:50.010> I'll<00:00:50.190> go<00:00:50.430> over<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.760> I'll<00:00:50.910> do

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
won't run and I'll go over and I'll do
