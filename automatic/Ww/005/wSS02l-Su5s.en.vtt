pretty<00:00:43.020> similar<00:00:43.440> but<00:00:43.950> if<00:00:44.879> you'll<00:00:45.090> notice<00:00:45.500> this

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
pretty similar but if you'll notice this

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.229 
pretty similar but if you'll notice this
one<00:00:46.800> right<00:00:47.100> here<00:00:48.890> it's<00:00:49.890> cap<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.520> off<00:00:50.789> just

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
one right here it's cap is off just

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.750 
one right here it's cap is off just
slightly<00:00:51.600> if<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.649> look<00:00:52.890> at<00:00:53.010> your<00:00:53.190> markers<00:00:53.610> you

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
slightly if you look at your markers you

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.240 
slightly if you look at your markers you
have<00:00:53.910> them<00:00:54.120> set<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.719> can<00:00:54.930> easily<00:00:55.289> see<00:00:55.860> if<00:00:56.010> they

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
have them set you can easily see if they

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.439 
have them set you can easily see if they
are<00:00:56.370> marked<00:00:56.670> if<00:00:56.910> they<00:00:57.210> are<00:00:57.360> closed<00:00:58.280> so<00:00:59.449> just

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
are marked if they are closed so just

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.759 
are marked if they are closed so just
all<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.780> need<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.020> do<00:01:01.640> tap<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:03.559> that's<00:01:04.559> the

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
all you need to do tap it that's the

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.640 
all you need to do tap it that's the
best<00:01:04.979> way<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.270> keep<00:01:06.270> them<00:01:06.510> sealed<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.229> it's

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
best way to keep them sealed and it's

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.520 
best way to keep them sealed and it's
just<00:01:07.830> very<00:01:08.280> easy<00:01:08.610> i<00:01:08.820> love<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:09.630> if<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:10.320> see

this side where the fine nib is so that
because<00:02:26.560> I<00:02:26.590> usually<00:02:27.550> in<00:02:27.820> most<00:02:28.450> cases<00:02:29.580> use<00:02:30.580> the

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
because I usually in most cases use the

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.900 
because I usually in most cases use the
brush<00:02:31.030> end<00:02:31.470> so<00:02:32.470> that<00:02:33.070> way<00:02:33.310> I<00:02:33.340> can<00:02:33.640> quickly

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
brush end so that way I can quickly

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.930 
brush end so that way I can quickly
locate<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.600> brush<00:02:34.840> nib<00:02:35.110> from<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.370> fine<00:02:36.640> nib

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
locate the brush nib from the fine nib

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.460 
locate the brush nib from the fine nib

you're if you're doing misting they will
get<00:03:20.680> wet<00:03:21.180> so<00:03:22.180> those<00:03:22.930> will<00:03:23.260> start<00:03:23.650> to<00:03:23.830> react<00:03:24.630> so

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
get wet so those will start to react so

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.220 
get wet so those will start to react so
what<00:03:26.350> I<00:03:26.380> do<00:03:26.530> with<00:03:27.190> mine<00:03:27.460> is<00:03:27.760> as<00:03:28.630> they<00:03:28.840> startin

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
what I do with mine is as they startin

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.930 
what I do with mine is as they startin
to<00:03:29.320> lighten<00:03:29.620> up<00:03:29.740> then<00:03:30.340> I<00:03:30.490> will<00:03:30.550> use<00:03:30.790> the

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
to lighten up then I will use the

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.820 
to lighten up then I will use the
distress<00:03:31.330> inks<00:03:31.780> because<00:03:32.110> obviously<00:03:32.260> you

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
distress inks because obviously you

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.580 
distress inks because obviously you
can't<00:03:33.070> color<00:03:33.400> with<00:03:33.610> it<00:03:33.730> I<00:03:34.170> will<00:03:35.170> use<00:03:35.350> the

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
can't color with it I will use the

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.530 
can't color with it I will use the
distress<00:03:36.190> inks<00:03:36.550> and<00:03:36.670> just<00:03:36.970> go<00:03:37.120> over<00:03:37.270> it<00:03:37.420> with

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
distress inks and just go over it with

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.810 
distress inks and just go over it with
the<00:03:37.720> blending<00:03:38.110> tool<00:03:38.350> just<00:03:38.920> to<00:03:39.040> add<00:03:39.340> more<00:03:39.610> color

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
the blending tool just to add more color

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.540 
the blending tool just to add more color
on<00:03:40.120> to<00:03:40.330> it<00:03:40.480> and<00:03:40.660> that's<00:03:41.530> just<00:03:41.740> so<00:03:41.890> I<00:03:41.920> can<00:03:42.100> easily

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
on to it and that's just so I can easily

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.140 
on to it and that's just so I can easily
see<00:03:43.090> what<00:03:43.270> color<00:03:43.510> I<00:03:43.630> want<00:03:43.750> to<00:03:44.140> use<00:03:45.030> though<00:03:46.030> the

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
see what color I want to use though the

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.190 
see what color I want to use though the
caps<00:03:46.390> are<00:03:46.660> good<00:03:47.190> you<00:03:48.190> can<00:03:48.400> tell<00:03:48.700> that<00:03:49.110> you<00:03:50.110> know

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
caps are good you can tell that you know

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.360 
caps are good you can tell that you know
it's<00:03:50.320> a<00:03:50.380> little<00:03:50.590> bit<00:03:50.680> lighter<00:03:50.860> than<00:03:50.980> the<00:03:51.190> cap

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
it's a little bit lighter than the cap

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.400 
it's a little bit lighter than the cap
so<00:03:52.209> hopefully<00:03:52.570> that<00:03:52.750> will<00:03:52.810> give<00:03:52.990> you<00:03:53.110> a<00:03:53.140> couple
