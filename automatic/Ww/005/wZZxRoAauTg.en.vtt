here's<00:00:05.740> a<00:00:05.800> quick<00:00:06.070> technique<00:00:06.430> for<00:00:06.670> working

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:07.030 
here's a quick technique for working

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.750 
here's a quick technique for working
with<00:00:07.210> cartoon<00:00:08.020> eyes<00:00:08.230> or<00:00:08.680> eyes<00:00:09.100> that<00:00:09.490> aren't

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:09.760 
with cartoon eyes or eyes that aren't

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.299 
with cartoon eyes or eyes that aren't
spherical<00:00:10.240> on<00:00:10.389> this<00:00:10.840> frog<00:00:11.170> character<00:00:11.740> we've

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:12.309 
spherical on this frog character we've

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.289 
spherical on this frog character we've
got<00:00:12.550> oval<00:00:13.030> eyes<00:00:13.289> that<00:00:14.289> fit<00:00:14.590> snug<00:00:15.160> into<00:00:16.030> the<00:00:16.270> eye

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:16.299 
got oval eyes that fit snug into the eye

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.500 
got oval eyes that fit snug into the eye
socket<00:00:17.140> and<00:00:17.320> if<00:00:18.190> we<00:00:18.369> were<00:00:18.490> to<00:00:18.550> go<00:00:18.760> and<00:00:18.970> animate

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:19.510 
socket and if we were to go and animate

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.089 
socket and if we were to go and animate
these<00:00:19.720> like<00:00:19.990> just<00:00:20.170> have<00:00:20.350> the<00:00:20.560> character<00:00:20.920> look

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:21.099 
these like just have the character look

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:22.500 
these like just have the character look
around<00:00:21.460> let's<00:00:21.760> see<00:00:21.880> what<00:00:22.029> would<00:00:22.119> happen<00:00:22.269> i'm

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:22.510 
around let's see what would happen i'm

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.679 
around let's see what would happen i'm
going<00:00:22.630> to<00:00:22.689> go<00:00:22.779> to<00:00:22.840> for<00:00:23.500> windows<00:00:23.920> and<00:00:24.539> zoom<00:00:25.539> in

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:25.689 
going to go to for windows and zoom in

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.609 
going to go to for windows and zoom in
here<00:00:25.720> grab<00:00:26.320> this<00:00:26.349> I<00:00:26.740> and<00:00:27.160> if<00:00:28.089> I<00:00:28.330> were<00:00:28.509> to<00:00:28.810> rotate

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
here grab this I and if I were to rotate

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.380 
here grab this I and if I were to rotate
this<00:00:30.130> I<00:00:30.339> I'm<00:00:30.519> going<00:00:30.669> to<00:00:30.730> try<00:00:31.029> and<00:00:31.060> find<00:00:31.269> the

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
this I I'm going to try and find the

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.000 
this I I'm going to try and find the
center<00:00:31.660> just<00:00:31.900> say<00:00:31.990> roughly<00:00:32.349> about<00:00:32.529> right<00:00:32.800> here

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
center just say roughly about right here

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.070 
center just say roughly about right here
and<00:00:33.190> if<00:00:33.730> I<00:00:33.850> were<00:00:34.000> to<00:00:34.120> rotate<00:00:34.270> the<00:00:34.690> eye<00:00:34.720> to<00:00:34.840> have

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.080 
and if I were to rotate the eye to have

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.069 
and if I were to rotate the eye to have
him<00:00:35.200> look<00:00:35.380> up<00:00:35.590> as<00:00:35.860> you<00:00:36.160> can<00:00:36.340> see<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:37.719> comes<00:00:37.960> out

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079 
him look up as you can see it comes out

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:39.959 
him look up as you can see it comes out
of<00:00:38.200> socket<00:00:38.410> now<00:00:38.980> if<00:00:39.100> it<00:00:39.219> was<00:00:39.309> a<00:00:39.340> perfect<00:00:39.850> sphere

00:00:39.959 --> 00:00:39.969 
of socket now if it was a perfect sphere

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:41.970 
of socket now if it was a perfect sphere
it<00:00:40.660> wouldn't<00:00:40.989> do<00:00:41.110> that<00:00:41.140> it<00:00:41.559> would<00:00:41.649> it<00:00:41.950> would

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
it wouldn't do that it would it would

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.930 
it wouldn't do that it would it would
stay<00:00:42.460> within<00:00:42.670> the<00:00:42.910> socket<00:00:43.329> so<00:00:44.260> how<00:00:44.559> do<00:00:44.620> we<00:00:44.940> how

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
stay within the socket so how do we how

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.479 
stay within the socket so how do we how
do<00:00:46.000> we<00:00:46.149> animate<00:00:46.660> this<00:00:46.899> character<00:00:47.500> who<00:00:48.460> has

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
do we animate this character who has

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:51.990 
do we animate this character who has
oval<00:00:48.940> eyes<00:00:49.120> and<00:00:50.370> butt<00:00:51.370> as<00:00:51.520> if<00:00:51.550> they<00:00:51.940> were

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
oval eyes and butt as if they were

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.380 
oval eyes and butt as if they were
spherical<00:00:52.600> well<00:00:52.809> the<00:00:53.230> trick<00:00:53.469> is<00:00:53.530> to<00:00:54.359> work<00:00:55.359> with

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
spherical well the trick is to work with

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.389 
spherical well the trick is to work with
spherical<00:00:55.870> eyes<00:00:56.170> but<00:00:56.859> I<00:00:56.890> don't<00:00:57.070> want<00:00:57.250> to

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 
spherical eyes but I don't want to

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:59.610 
spherical eyes but I don't want to
change<00:00:57.670> the<00:00:58.000> shape<00:00:58.239> of<00:00:58.449> the<00:00:58.510> characters<00:00:59.440> eyes

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
change the shape of the characters eyes

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.380 
change the shape of the characters eyes
it<00:00:59.980> kind<00:01:00.280> of<00:01:00.309> gives<00:01:00.489> them<00:01:00.670> the<00:01:00.789> personality

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
it kind of gives them the personality

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.259 
it kind of gives them the personality
that<00:01:01.510> he<00:01:01.629> has<00:01:01.840> so<00:01:02.679> this<00:01:03.309> is<00:01:03.489> a<00:01:03.519> technique<00:01:03.969> that

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
that he has so this is a technique that

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.750 
that he has so this is a technique that
I<00:01:04.960> picked<00:01:05.620> up<00:01:05.710> from<00:01:05.770> Johnny<00:01:06.130> Gordon<00:01:06.550> years

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
I picked up from Johnny Gordon years

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.730 
I picked up from Johnny Gordon years
back<00:01:07.000> and<00:01:07.330> i'd<00:01:07.990> like<00:01:08.020> to<00:01:08.170> share<00:01:08.410> it<00:01:08.500> with<00:01:08.560> you

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
back and i'd like to share it with you

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.710 
back and i'd like to share it with you
so<00:01:09.009> we're<00:01:09.700> going<00:01:09.790> to<00:01:09.880> go<00:01:09.909> ahead<00:01:10.299> and<00:01:10.450> let's

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
so we're going to go ahead and let's

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.249 
so we're going to go ahead and let's
just<00:01:10.900> work<00:01:11.080> with<00:01:11.259> one<00:01:11.470> eye<00:01:11.500> i'm<00:01:11.950> going<00:01:12.070> to<00:01:12.159> take

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
just work with one eye i'm going to take

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:19.469 
just work with one eye i'm going to take
this<00:01:14.259> oval<00:01:14.650> i<00:01:15.119> copy<00:01:17.040> paste<00:01:18.040> on<00:01:18.340> top<00:01:18.759> of<00:01:19.270> the

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
this oval i copy paste on top of the

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.330 
this oval i copy paste on top of the
spherical<00:01:20.020> I<00:01:20.259> just<00:01:20.470> so<00:01:20.530> I<00:01:20.560> can<00:01:20.680> grab<00:01:20.979> both<00:01:21.310> of

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
spherical I just so I can grab both of

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.310 
spherical I just so I can grab both of
them<00:01:21.670> and<00:01:21.960> copy<00:01:22.960> and<00:01:23.350> we'll<00:01:23.890> go<00:01:24.009> file<00:01:24.369> new

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
them and copy and we'll go file new

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.630 
them and copy and we'll go file new
paste<00:01:26.320> I'm<00:01:26.920> going<00:01:27.009> to<00:01:27.100> go<00:01:27.159> ahead<00:01:27.189> and<00:01:27.310> center

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
paste I'm going to go ahead and center

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.569 
paste I'm going to go ahead and center
with<00:01:27.820> f2<00:01:28.030> and<00:01:29.280> drop<00:01:30.280> the<00:01:30.790> Oval<00:01:31.240> I<00:01:32.070> into<00:01:33.070> layer<00:01:33.280> 2

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
with f2 and drop the Oval I into layer 2

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:35.580 
with f2 and drop the Oval I into layer 2
so<00:01:34.180> I've<00:01:34.270> got<00:01:34.420> two<00:01:34.659> layers<00:01:34.930> now<00:01:35.020> this<00:01:35.320> is<00:01:35.439> going

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
so I've got two layers now this is going

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.249 
so I've got two layers now this is going
to<00:01:35.649> be<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:36.040> I<00:01:36.250> that<00:01:36.700> I<00:01:36.759> work<00:01:37.060> with<00:01:37.090> my<00:01:37.600> final<00:01:38.110> I

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
to be the I that I work with my final I

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.340 
to be the I that I work with my final I
and<00:01:38.590> and<00:01:39.189> layer<00:01:39.700> 2<00:01:40.000> is<00:01:40.180> the<00:01:40.390> oval<00:01:40.810> I<00:01:40.899> is<00:01:40.960> going

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
and and layer 2 is the oval I is going

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.590 
and and layer 2 is the oval I is going
to<00:01:41.500> be<00:01:41.619> my<00:01:41.890> template<00:01:42.460> that<00:01:43.000> I'll<00:01:43.149> get<00:01:43.360> rid<00:01:43.540> of

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
to be my template that I'll get rid of

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.490 
to be my template that I'll get rid of
once<00:01:44.320> i<00:01:44.530> have<00:01:44.799> my<00:01:45.310> i<00:01:45.340> set<00:01:45.970> up<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:47.229> let's<00:01:47.380> go

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
once i have my i set up so let's go

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.719 
once i have my i set up so let's go
ahead<00:01:47.530> and<00:01:47.649> save<00:01:47.920> that<00:01:47.950> off<00:01:48.299> so<00:01:49.299> save<00:01:49.990> object

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
ahead and save that off so save object

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:59.340 
ahead and save that off so save object
will<00:01:51.729> call<00:01:51.969> this<00:01:53.729> oval<00:01:54.729> I<00:01:55.320> 201<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:58.079> let's<00:01:59.079> fire

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
will call this oval I 201 and let's fire

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.639 
will call this oval I 201 and let's fire
it<00:01:59.380> over<00:01:59.590> to<00:01:59.890> layout<00:02:00.329> send<00:02:01.329> object<00:02:01.810> to<00:02:02.350> lay<00:02:02.469> out

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
it over to layout send object to lay out

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.620 
it over to layout send object to lay out
ok<00:02:03.579> so<00:02:04.090> I<00:02:04.390> have<00:02:04.450> my<00:02:05.430> oval<00:02:06.430> I<00:02:06.549> and<00:02:06.909> I<00:02:07.030> have<00:02:07.270> my

our spherical I and I need to draw some

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.870 
our spherical I and I need to draw some
bones<00:02:29.350> so<00:02:29.800> I'm<00:02:29.860> going<00:02:30.010> to<00:02:30.040> temporarily<00:02:30.550> go

bones so I'm going to temporarily go
into<00:02:31.270> wireframe<00:02:31.930> mode<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:32.970> change<00:02:33.970> over<00:02:34.420> to

into wireframe mode and change over to

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.870 
into wireframe mode and change over to
the<00:02:35.709> right<00:02:36.370> view<00:02:36.840> so<00:02:37.840> that<00:02:37.870> I<00:02:37.989> can<00:02:38.700> draw<00:02:39.700> some

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
the right view so that I can draw some

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.870 
the right view so that I can draw some
bones<00:02:40.120> in<00:02:40.300> here<00:02:40.480> I'm<00:02:41.110> going<00:02:41.290> to<00:02:41.350> have<00:02:41.880> two

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
bones in here I'm going to have two

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.760 
bones in here I'm going to have two
bones<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.540> i'm<00:02:43.630> going<00:02:43.720> to<00:02:43.780> start<00:02:44.020> from<00:02:44.380> the

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
bones and i'm going to start from the

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.790 
bones and i'm going to start from the
the<00:02:45.610> center<00:02:45.940> of<00:02:46.000> my<00:02:46.330> my<00:02:46.930> sphere<00:02:47.290> so<00:02:47.530> that<00:02:47.680> it'll

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
the center of my my sphere so that it'll

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.190 
the center of my my sphere so that it'll
rotate<00:02:48.010> properly<00:02:48.730> so<00:02:49.569> i'll<00:02:49.660> go<00:02:49.810> over<00:02:49.840> to<00:02:50.080> the

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
rotate properly so i'll go over to the

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.990 
rotate properly so i'll go over to the
setup<00:02:50.500> tab<00:02:50.530> and<00:02:52.380> choose<00:02:53.380> draw<00:02:54.100> child<00:02:54.700> bones

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
because i'm going to draw 2 i'm just

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.910 
because i'm going to draw 2 i'm just
going<00:02:57.250> to<00:02:57.280> draw<00:02:57.489> a<00:02:57.519> small<00:02:58.560> bone<00:02:59.560> right<00:02:59.860> here

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
going to draw a small bone right here

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.570 
going to draw a small bone right here
and<00:03:01.380> I'll<00:03:02.380> draw<00:03:02.650> a<00:03:02.680> child<00:03:02.980> off<00:03:03.250> of<00:03:03.430> it<00:03:03.550> that's

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
and I'll draw a child off of it that's

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.949 
and I'll draw a child off of it that's
much<00:03:03.880> bigger<00:03:05.550> I'm<00:03:06.550> going<00:03:06.700> to<00:03:06.760> set<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:07.540> i'm

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
much bigger I'm going to set the i'm

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.309 
much bigger I'm going to set the i'm
going<00:03:08.110> to<00:03:08.200> use<00:03:09.130> t<00:03:09.459> for<00:03:09.730> move<00:03:09.940> and<00:03:10.300> i'm<00:03:11.140> just

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
going to use t for move and i'm just

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.420 
going to use t for move and i'm just
going<00:03:11.440> to<00:03:11.470> move<00:03:11.769> the<00:03:12.310> child<00:03:12.610> bone<00:03:12.910> back<00:03:14.430> to

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
going to move the child bone back to

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.400 
going to move the child bone back to
zero<00:03:15.790> and<00:03:16.150> the<00:03:16.269> Z<00:03:18.450> ok<00:03:19.450> I<00:03:19.600> just<00:03:19.810> went<00:03:20.230> ahead<00:03:20.290> and

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
zero and the Z ok I just went ahead and

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.900 
zero and the Z ok I just went ahead and
numerically<00:03:20.950> entered<00:03:21.190> it<00:03:21.310> just<00:03:21.489> so<00:03:21.640> that<00:03:21.670> it

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
numerically entered it just so that it

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.590 
numerically entered it just so that it
be<00:03:22.090> perfectly<00:03:22.750> at<00:03:22.959> zero<00:03:23.260> now<00:03:24.220> because<00:03:25.150> I<00:03:25.360> move

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
be perfectly at zero now because I move

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.479 
be perfectly at zero now because I move
this<00:03:25.840> bone<00:03:26.140> actually<00:03:26.680> I'm<00:03:26.769> not<00:03:26.950> going<00:03:27.220> to<00:03:27.310> rest

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
this bone actually I'm not going to rest

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.100 
this bone actually I'm not going to rest
it<00:03:27.700> yet<00:03:27.850> just<00:03:28.060> so<00:03:28.150> you<00:03:28.239> can<00:03:28.360> see<00:03:28.420> what<00:03:28.720> happens

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
it yet just so you can see what happens

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.100 
it yet just so you can see what happens
I'm<00:03:29.530> going<00:03:29.680> to<00:03:30.450> I'm<00:03:31.450> going<00:03:31.510> to<00:03:31.660> go<00:03:31.780> ahead<00:03:31.810> and

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
I'm going to I'm going to go ahead and

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:38.789 
I'm going to I'm going to go ahead and
turn<00:03:32.769> bones<00:03:33.130> on<00:03:33.780> and<00:03:36.239> now<00:03:37.239> I'm<00:03:37.510> going<00:03:37.660> to<00:03:37.799> take

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
turn bones on and now I'm going to take

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.720 
turn bones on and now I'm going to take
the<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:40.150> parent<00:03:40.600> bone<00:03:40.810> and<00:03:41.250> p4<00:03:42.250> properties

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
the the parent bone and p4 properties

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.539 
the the parent bone and p4 properties
I'm<00:03:42.910> going<00:03:43.030> to<00:03:43.090> make<00:03:43.239> a<00:03:43.480> strength<00:03:44.049> zero<00:03:44.860> did

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
I'm going to make a strength zero did

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.199 
I'm going to make a strength zero did
you<00:03:45.700> see<00:03:45.970> the<00:03:46.570> mesh<00:03:46.840> move<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:48.370> points<00:03:49.000> move

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
you see the mesh move the points move

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.910 
you see the mesh move the points move
now<00:03:49.840> what<00:03:50.410> I<00:03:50.440> just<00:03:50.680> realized<00:03:50.970> is<00:03:51.970> that<00:03:52.060> I'm<00:03:52.920> not

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
now what I just realized is that I'm not

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.580 
now what I just realized is that I'm not
putting<00:03:54.700> the<00:03:54.790> bones<00:03:55.000> in<00:03:55.269> the<00:03:55.390> in<00:03:55.630> the<00:03:55.989> proper

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
putting the bones in the in the proper

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.099 
putting the bones in the in the proper
object<00:03:57.579> I'm<00:03:58.030> putting<00:03:58.420> them<00:03:58.510> in<00:03:58.600> layer<00:03:58.810> to

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
object I'm putting them in layer to

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.890 
object I'm putting them in layer to
which<00:03:59.709> which<00:04:00.489> is<00:04:00.730> just<00:04:00.970> our<00:04:01.090> template<00:04:01.480> so<00:04:01.660> I'm

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
which which is just our template so I'm

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.330 
which which is just our template so I'm
going<00:04:02.049> to<00:04:02.079> go<00:04:02.170> ahead<00:04:02.200> and<00:04:02.380> remove<00:04:02.620> that<00:04:02.829> I

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
going to go ahead and remove that I

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.530 
going to go ahead and remove that I
should<00:04:03.549> have<00:04:03.670> been<00:04:03.760> paying<00:04:03.970> a<00:04:04.090> little<00:04:04.299> closer

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
should have been paying a little closer

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.270 
should have been paying a little closer
attention<00:04:04.750> to<00:04:05.049> that<00:04:05.230> so<00:04:05.769> I'm<00:04:05.859> going<00:04:05.980> to<00:04:06.010> clear

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
attention to that so I'm going to clear

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.270 
attention to that so I'm going to clear
it<00:04:06.400> and<00:04:06.519> it's<00:04:06.820> child<00:04:07.590> ok<00:04:08.590> that's<00:04:08.980> ok<00:04:09.070> because

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
it and it's child ok that's ok because

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.310 
it and it's child ok that's ok because
we<00:04:09.489> can<00:04:09.640> just<00:04:09.760> go<00:04:09.880> ahead<00:04:09.910> and<00:04:10.120> and<00:04:10.420> select<00:04:11.140> this

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
we can just go ahead and and select this

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.590 
we can just go ahead and and select this
object<00:04:11.530> and<00:04:12.010> now<00:04:12.730> we're<00:04:13.120> going<00:04:13.209> to<00:04:13.269> put<00:04:13.359> bones

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
object and now we're going to put bones

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.390 
object and now we're going to put bones
in<00:04:13.750> this<00:04:13.930> I'm<00:04:14.260> glad<00:04:14.380> I<00:04:14.500> happened<00:04:14.739> so<00:04:15.160> that<00:04:15.190> you

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
in this I'm glad I happened so that you

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.750 
in this I'm glad I happened so that you
can<00:04:15.579> see<00:04:16.229> that<00:04:17.229> it<00:04:17.350> is<00:04:17.380> important<00:04:18.010> to<00:04:18.190> put<00:04:18.640> the

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
can see that it is important to put the

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.230 
can see that it is important to put the
bones<00:04:18.940> in<00:04:19.150> the<00:04:19.239> right<00:04:20.430> object<00:04:21.430> or<00:04:21.940> that's<00:04:22.120> my

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
bones in the right object or that's my

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.840 
bones in the right object or that's my
excuse<00:04:22.600> for<00:04:22.750> why<00:04:22.870> I<00:04:22.900> made<00:04:23.140> the<00:04:23.289> mistake<00:04:23.320> I<00:04:23.860> can

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
excuse for why I made the mistake I can

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.730 
excuse for why I made the mistake I can
be<00:04:24.940> honest<00:04:25.240> so<00:04:25.600> I'm<00:04:26.050> going<00:04:26.169> to<00:04:26.200> move<00:04:26.349> this<00:04:26.530> back

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
be honest so I'm going to move this back

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.430 
be honest so I'm going to move this back
but<00:04:27.250> you<00:04:27.370> get<00:04:27.460> to<00:04:27.580> see<00:04:27.760> me<00:04:27.789> doing<00:04:28.479> it<00:04:28.720> twice<00:04:29.110> and

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
but you get to see me doing it twice and

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.010 
but you get to see me doing it twice and
you<00:04:29.830> don't<00:04:29.979> have<00:04:30.039> to<00:04:30.159> rewind<00:04:30.430> ok<00:04:31.210> so<00:04:31.270> child

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
you don't have to rewind ok so child

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.559 
you don't have to rewind ok so child
is<00:04:32.349> back<00:04:33.250> at<00:04:33.520> let<00:04:33.729> me<00:04:33.789> go<00:04:33.879> ahead<00:04:34.030> and<00:04:34.150> type<00:04:34.330> in<00:04:34.539> 0

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:34.569 
is back at let me go ahead and type in 0

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:40.469 
is back at let me go ahead and type in 0
and<00:04:36.270> now<00:04:37.270> when<00:04:37.900> I<00:04:37.930> activate<00:04:38.889> the<00:04:39.039> bones<00:04:39.479> see

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
and now when I activate the bones see

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:42.689 
and now when I activate the bones see
the<00:04:40.509> bone<00:04:40.810> see<00:04:41.259> the<00:04:41.379> ball<00:04:41.530> shifts<00:04:42.250> the<00:04:42.430> DI

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:42.699 
the bone see the ball shifts the DI

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:44.850 
the bone see the ball shifts the DI
shifts<00:04:43.330> it's<00:04:43.750> because<00:04:44.080> if<00:04:44.259> I'm<00:04:44.470> going<00:04:44.560> to<00:04:44.650> move

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
shifts it's because if I'm going to move

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.270 
shifts it's because if I'm going to move
my<00:04:44.970> my<00:04:45.970> bone<00:04:46.210> and<00:04:47.169> I<00:04:47.259> want<00:04:47.470> it<00:04:47.530> for<00:04:47.680> my<00:04:47.770> final

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
my my bone and I want it for my final

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.570 
my my bone and I want it for my final
resting<00:04:48.639> place<00:04:48.879> I<00:04:49.169> need<00:04:50.169> it<00:04:50.319> to<00:04:50.470> be<00:04:50.620> rested

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
resting place I need it to be rested

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.180 
resting place I need it to be rested
which<00:04:51.940> is<00:04:52.090> just<00:04:52.270> our<00:04:52.419> on<00:04:52.720> the<00:04:52.840> keyboard<00:04:53.259> I<00:04:53.470> am

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
which is just our on the keyboard I am

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.520 
which is just our on the keyboard I am
going<00:04:54.340> to<00:04:54.430> take<00:04:54.580> the<00:04:54.759> parent<00:04:55.090> bone<00:04:55.270> and<00:04:55.599> I'm

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
going to take the parent bone and I'm

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.969 
going to take the parent bone and I'm
going<00:04:56.860> to<00:04:57.300> set<00:04:58.300> the<00:04:58.419> strength<00:04:58.750> to<00:04:59.199> 0<00:04:59.500> because<00:04:59.800> I

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979 
going to set the strength to 0 because I

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:02.129 
going to set the strength to 0 because I
don't<00:05:00.159> need<00:05:00.340> that<00:05:00.400> bone<00:05:00.789> for<00:05:01.539> anything<00:05:01.810> other

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
don't need that bone for anything other

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:05.399 
don't need that bone for anything other
than<00:05:02.669> shaping<00:05:03.669> the<00:05:04.240> object<00:05:04.720> now<00:05:05.169> I<00:05:05.199> need<00:05:05.380> to

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:05.409 
than shaping the object now I need to

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:08.820 
than shaping the object now I need to
get<00:05:05.590> this<00:05:05.860> sphere<00:05:06.610> into<00:05:06.849> the<00:05:07.599> shape<00:05:07.870> of<00:05:08.139> this

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
get this sphere into the shape of this

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.749 
get this sphere into the shape of this
oval<00:05:09.479> so<00:05:10.479> H<00:05:10.780> for<00:05:11.259> stretch<00:05:11.530> and<00:05:11.770> we'll<00:05:12.610> just

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:12.759 
oval so H for stretch and we'll just

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:18.210 
oval so H for stretch and we'll just
stretch<00:05:13.030> it<00:05:13.090> up<00:05:14.099> something<00:05:15.099> like<00:05:15.360> so<00:05:17.220> and

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
stretch it up something like so and

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.309 
stretch it up something like so and
let's<00:05:18.819> go<00:05:18.940> back<00:05:19.000> to<00:05:19.210> our<00:05:19.419> perspective<00:05:20.080> view

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:20.319 
let's go back to our perspective view

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:25.730 
let's go back to our perspective view
and<00:05:21.150> back<00:05:22.150> to<00:05:22.419> texture<00:05:23.020> shaded<00:05:23.620> solid<00:05:23.979> view

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
and back to texture shaded solid view

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:32.879 
and back to texture shaded solid view
okay<00:05:26.740> and<00:05:26.949> now<00:05:27.789> when<00:05:28.569> I<00:05:28.919> rotate<00:05:29.919> my<00:05:30.310> eye<00:05:31.889> it

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:32.889 
okay and now when I rotate my eye it

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:36.689 
okay and now when I rotate my eye it
conforms<00:05:33.520> to<00:05:33.969> that<00:05:34.240> shape<00:05:35.250> so<00:05:36.250> the<00:05:36.370> parent

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:36.699 
conforms to that shape so the parent

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:38.879 
conforms to that shape so the parent
bone<00:05:36.880> is<00:05:37.090> stretching<00:05:37.569> it<00:05:37.659> into<00:05:38.139> the<00:05:38.680> shape

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:38.889 
bone is stretching it into the shape

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:41.580 
bone is stretching it into the shape
that<00:05:38.949> we<00:05:39.159> need<00:05:39.550> and<00:05:39.930> the<00:05:40.930> child<00:05:41.139> bone<00:05:41.409> is

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
that we need and the child bone is

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.339 
that we need and the child bone is
actually<00:05:41.770> what<00:05:42.280> we're<00:05:42.400> using<00:05:42.610> for<00:05:43.349> animation

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:44.349 
actually what we're using for animation

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:45.899 
actually what we're using for animation
so<00:05:44.469> if<00:05:44.530> you<00:05:44.650> want<00:05:44.830> you<00:05:44.979> can<00:05:45.099> hide<00:05:45.370> and<00:05:45.550> lock<00:05:45.729> the

00:05:45.899 --> 00:05:45.909 
so if you want you can hide and lock the

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:49.439 
so if you want you can hide and lock the
parent<00:05:46.210> bone<00:05:46.330> but<00:05:46.780> because<00:05:47.139> it's<00:05:47.349> set<00:05:47.590> to<00:05:48.449> zero

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:49.449 
parent bone but because it's set to zero

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:50.820 
parent bone but because it's set to zero
strength<00:05:49.840> it's<00:05:50.050> not<00:05:50.229> going<00:05:50.349> to<00:05:50.440> affect<00:05:50.500> the

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
strength it's not going to affect the

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.950 
strength it's not going to affect the
eye<00:05:50.860> at<00:05:51.130> all<00:05:51.279> but<00:05:51.880> if<00:05:52.120> you<00:05:52.270> ended<00:05:52.630> up<00:05:52.750> changing

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
eye at all but if you ended up changing

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.870 
eye at all but if you ended up changing
that<00:05:53.259> over<00:05:53.680> the<00:05:53.830> course<00:05:54.009> of<00:05:54.190> the<00:05:54.310> animation<00:05:54.639> it

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
that over the course of the animation it

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.689 
that over the course of the animation it
would<00:05:55.029> affect<00:05:55.870> the<00:05:55.960> the<00:05:56.590> child<00:05:56.889> bone<00:05:57.340> which<00:05:57.550> is

00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:57.699 
would affect the the child bone which is

00:05:57.699 --> 00:05:59.670 
would affect the the child bone which is
what<00:05:57.849> we're<00:05:57.969> using<00:05:58.150> for<00:05:58.419> animation<00:05:58.840> so<00:05:59.409> see

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 
what we're using for animation so see

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.760 
what we're using for animation so see
even<00:05:59.949> whenever<00:06:00.219> I<00:06:00.279> go<00:06:00.430> all<00:06:00.639> the<00:06:00.819> way<00:06:00.849> up<00:06:01.060> top

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
even whenever I go all the way up top

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:07.769 
even whenever I go all the way up top
we've<00:06:02.770> got<00:06:05.610> the<00:06:06.610> iris<00:06:07.210> and<00:06:07.360> the<00:06:07.449> pupil

00:06:07.769 --> 00:06:07.779 
we've got the iris and the pupil

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:10.260 
we've got the iris and the pupil
conforming<00:06:08.349> to<00:06:08.380> that<00:06:08.590> shade<00:06:08.860> so<00:06:09.460> this<00:06:10.090> way

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
conforming to that shade so this way

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.629 
conforming to that shade so this way
this<00:06:10.569> would<00:06:10.710> stay<00:06:11.710> within<00:06:11.919> the<00:06:12.130> socket<00:06:12.490> of<00:06:12.580> the

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639 
this would stay within the socket of the

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:17.100 
this would stay within the socket of the
the<00:06:13.150> eye<00:06:13.180> and<00:06:15.659> be<00:06:16.659> able<00:06:16.750> to<00:06:16.930> have<00:06:17.080> that

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
the eye and be able to have that

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.550 
the eye and be able to have that
cartoony<00:06:17.889> I<00:06:17.919> set<00:06:18.430> up
