gap<00:02:17.400> of<00:02:17.670> wood<00:02:18.020> beyond<00:02:19.020> my<00:02:19.349> design<00:02:19.860> some<00:02:20.819> of

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
gap of wood beyond my design some of

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.110 
gap of wood beyond my design some of
that<00:02:21.180> we<00:02:21.420> have<00:02:21.599> wood<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:22.050> work<00:02:22.200> with<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:22.800> we're

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
that we have wood to work with and we're

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.670 
that we have wood to work with and we're
covering<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.239> edges<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:24.930> that's<00:02:25.170> our<00:02:25.380> next

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
covering the edges and that's our next

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.400 
covering the edges and that's our next
step<00:02:25.890> so<00:02:26.160> i'll<00:02:26.250> be<00:02:26.400> back<00:02:26.580> in<00:02:26.849> the<00:02:27.000> second<00:02:27.420> all

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:03.770 
like after about two hours of working on
the<00:02:56.910> edges<00:02:58.310> so<00:02:59.310> I've<00:03:00.180> just<00:03:00.480> used<00:03:00.600> a<00:03:02.780> really

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
the edges so I've just used a really

rough rock and then I use a smooth file

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.849 
rough rock and then I use a smooth file
to<00:03:08.340> just<00:03:08.640> go<00:03:09.450> around<00:03:09.510> all<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:11.040> edges<00:03:12.859> right

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
to just go around all the edges right

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:17.780 
to just go around all the edges right
now<00:03:14.040> it<00:03:14.160> looks<00:03:14.220> really<00:03:14.670> good<00:03:15.140> so<00:03:16.640> that's<00:03:17.640> the
