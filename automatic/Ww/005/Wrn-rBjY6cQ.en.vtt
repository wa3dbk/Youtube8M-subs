their Sega CD systems usually only get

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.109 
their Sega CD systems usually only get
just<00:00:18.170> this<00:00:18.349> one<00:00:18.560> plate<00:00:18.860> if<00:00:19.130> any<00:00:19.340> plates<00:00:19.610> at<00:00:19.759> all

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
but in actuality there's actually a

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.670 
but in actuality there's actually a
second<00:00:24.529> plate<00:00:25.480> that<00:00:26.480> stiffing<00:00:27.230> gets<00:00:27.439> out

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
second plate that stiffing gets out

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.429 
second plate that stiffing gets out
there<00:00:28.750> open<00:00:29.750> and<00:00:29.869> a<00:00:29.900> shelf<00:00:30.140> so<00:00:30.260> I<00:00:30.289> just

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
there open and a shelf so I just

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.900 
there open and a shelf so I just
mentioned<00:00:30.650> the<00:00:30.920> screw<00:00:31.279> to<00:00:32.620> this<00:00:33.620> bag<00:00:33.949> it<00:00:34.699> screw

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
mentioned the screw to this bag it screw

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.450 
mentioned the screw to this bag it screw
to<00:00:35.059> hold<00:00:35.360> the<00:00:36.080> plate<00:00:36.379> on<00:00:36.650> the<00:00:36.980> other<00:00:37.100> large

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
to hold the plate on the other large

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.340 
to hold the plate on the other large
plate<00:00:37.699> that<00:00:37.820> is<00:00:38.530> and<00:00:39.640> the<00:00:40.640> other<00:00:41.600> plate<00:00:41.870> here

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
plate that is and the other plate here

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.960 
plate that is and the other plate here
this<00:00:42.830> one<00:00:42.979> you<00:00:43.070> don't<00:00:43.220> see<00:00:43.339> too<00:00:43.489> often<00:00:43.699> and

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
this one you don't see too often and

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.189 
this one you don't see too often and
actually<00:00:44.210> had<00:00:44.330> this<00:00:44.449> in<00:00:44.570> my<00:00:44.629> other<00:00:44.750> system<00:00:45.110> I

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199 
actually had this in my other system I

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:48.009 
actually had this in my other system I
thought<00:00:45.470> there<00:00:45.650> were<00:00:45.739> three<00:00:45.769> but<00:00:46.900> just<00:00:47.900> this

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
thought there were three but just this

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:50.020 
thought there were three but just this
one<00:00:48.229> that<00:00:48.409> one<00:00:48.559> this<00:00:48.589> probably<00:00:49.430> most

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
one that one this probably most

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.130 
one that one this probably most
definitely<00:00:50.390> confirms<00:00:50.659> that<00:00:50.809> there<00:00:50.960> are<00:00:51.049> only

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
definitely confirms that there are only

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.430 
definitely confirms that there are only
two<00:00:51.760> so<00:00:52.760> it's<00:00:52.909> actually<00:00:53.479> Austin<00:00:53.989> had<00:00:54.170> this<00:00:54.320> in

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
two so it's actually Austin had this in

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.979 
two so it's actually Austin had this in
here<00:00:54.680> as<00:00:54.860> well<00:00:55.010> ones<00:00:55.549> not<00:00:56.210> all<00:00:56.570> too<00:00:56.690> common<00:00:56.930> to

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
here as well ones not all too common to

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:58.270 
here as well ones not all too common to
find<00:00:57.140> or<00:00:57.350> sometimes<00:00:57.650> you'll<00:00:57.799> find<00:00:57.979> them<00:00:58.129> in

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
find or sometimes you'll find them in

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.859 
find or sometimes you'll find them in
but<00:00:58.460> you<00:00:58.940> don't<00:00:59.000> see<00:00:59.210> it<00:00:59.299> too<00:00:59.390> often<00:00:59.510> but<00:00:59.720> there

00:00:59.859 --> 00:00:59.869
