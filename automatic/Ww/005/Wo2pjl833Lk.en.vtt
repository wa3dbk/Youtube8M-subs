00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
like my teammate was capturing see so I

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.780 
like my teammate was capturing see so I
just<00:00:31.050> ran<00:00:31.170> straight<00:00:31.560> down<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.859> be<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.219> checked

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.580 
just ran straight down to be I checked
the<00:00:32.850> stun<00:00:33.180> there<00:00:33.390> simply<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.780> see<00:00:34.350> if<00:00:34.410> there's

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
the stun there simply to see if there's

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.750 
the stun there simply to see if there's
anyone<00:00:34.739> there<00:00:34.860> so<00:00:35.130> he's<00:00:35.340> pretty<00:00:35.610> much

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
anyone there so he's pretty much

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.280 
anyone there so he's pretty much
disabled<00:00:36.329> he<00:00:36.420> can't<00:00:36.600> do<00:00:36.690> anything<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:37.200> it's

now that that place right there were

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.920 
now that that place right there were
just<00:00:44.370> done<00:00:44.579> was<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.969> really<00:00:45.450> really<00:00:45.660> high

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
just done was a really really high

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.479 
just done was a really really high
traffic<00:00:46.170> area<00:00:46.620> for<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.829> enemy<00:00:47.100> team<00:00:47.190> become

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
traffic area for the enemy team become

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.190 
traffic area for the enemy team become
and<00:00:47.610> try<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.789> capture<00:00:47.969> be<00:00:48.210> so<00:00:48.899> there<00:00:49.020> was<00:00:49.110> no

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
and try to capture be so there was no

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.990 
and try to capture be so there was no
one<00:00:49.410> there<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:50.190> this<00:00:50.460> pretty<00:00:50.610> much<00:00:50.730> tells

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
one there and so this pretty much tells

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.160 
one there and so this pretty much tells
me<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.270> enemy<00:00:51.480> team<00:00:51.600> isn't<00:00:51.809> really

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
me that the enemy team isn't really

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.619 
me that the enemy team isn't really
doing<00:00:52.289> much<00:00:52.440> at<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.890> moment<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.399> arm<00:00:53.640> to

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
doing much at the moment to arm to

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.930 
doing much at the moment to arm to
capture<00:00:54.899> flags<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.440> die<00:00:55.829> vague<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.640> know

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
capture flags I die vague and I know

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.490 
capture flags I die vague and I know
that<00:00:57.149> he's<00:00:57.270> dead<00:00:57.480> he's<00:00:57.899> there<00:00:58.079> now<00:00:58.140> that's

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
that he's dead he's there now that's

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.170 
that he's dead he's there now that's
pretty<00:00:58.770> close<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.039> be<00:00:59.309> so<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.609> pretty<00:00:59.850> much<00:00:59.940> run

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
pretty close to be so I pretty much run

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.270 
pretty close to be so I pretty much run
back<00:01:00.420> down<00:01:00.449> there<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.559> see<00:01:01.739> him<00:01:01.890> dolphin

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
back down there and I see him dolphin

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.060 
back down there and I see him dolphin
diving<00:01:02.520> across<00:01:03.510> down<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.930> be<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.619> die<00:01:04.680> here

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
diving across down to be so I die here

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.070 
diving across down to be so I die here
again<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.909> pretty<00:01:06.330> much<00:01:06.450> sends<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.049> a

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
again and that pretty much sends it to a

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.070 
again and that pretty much sends it to a
spiral<00:01:07.680> we<00:01:08.460> then<00:01:08.729> get<00:01:08.970> triple<00:01:09.390> cap<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.900> in<00:01:10.020> a

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
spiral we then get triple cap to in a

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.780 
spiral we then get triple cap to in a
second<00:01:10.380> you'll<00:01:10.560> see<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:10.950> that's<00:01:11.100> that's<00:01:11.490> very

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
second you'll see and that's that's very

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.010 
second you'll see and that's that's very
unfortunate<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.360> don't<00:01:12.479> want<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.659> get<00:01:12.750> triple

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
unfortunate you don't want to get triple

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.710 
unfortunate you don't want to get triple
capped<00:01:13.229> in<00:01:13.470> um<00:01:13.710> in<00:01:14.119> domination<00:01:15.119> especially

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
capped in um in domination especially

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.020 
capped in um in domination especially
losing<00:01:16.290> be<00:01:16.470> flag<00:01:16.770> in<00:01:17.009> jungle<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:17.520> very<00:01:17.759> crucial

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
losing be flag in jungle is very crucial

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.390 
losing be flag in jungle is very crucial
because<00:01:18.390> once<00:01:19.350> they<00:01:19.530> set<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.860> defense's<00:01:20.369> that

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
because once they set the defense's that

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.280 
because once they set the defense's that
you<00:01:21.000> can<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.540> will<00:01:21.600> have<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.780> very<00:01:21.930> hard<00:01:22.170> time

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
you can you will have a very hard time

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.280 
you can you will have a very hard time
getting<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.740> back<00:01:23.450> so<00:01:24.450> in<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:24.659> situation<00:01:24.810> I

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
and it is two people camping up on that

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.800 
and it is two people camping up on that
Ridge<00:01:50.399> but<00:01:50.610> they<00:01:50.729> do<00:01:50.820> absolutely<00:01:51.030> nothing<00:01:51.270> to

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
Ridge but they do absolutely nothing to

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.660 
Ridge but they do absolutely nothing to
stop<00:01:52.110> me<00:01:52.140> capturing<00:01:52.740> now<00:01:52.890> even<00:01:53.399> give<00:01:53.549> my

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
stop me capturing now even give my

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.130 
stop me capturing now even give my
position<00:01:54.119> away<00:01:54.299> but<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.570> still<00:01:54.780> don't<00:01:54.960> come

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
position away but it still don't come

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.899 
position away but it still don't come
down<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.439> kill<00:01:55.590> me<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.280> this<00:01:56.430> they<00:01:56.700> keep

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
down and kill me so this they keep

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.030 
down and kill me so this they keep
camping<00:01:57.299> up<00:01:57.420> there<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.899> that's<00:01:58.770> why<00:01:58.920> they

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
camping up there and that's why they

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.429 
camping up there and that's why they
lose<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.310> flag<00:01:59.600> now<00:02:00.600> this<00:02:00.750> obviously<00:02:01.229> means

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
lose the flag now this obviously means

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.230 
lose the flag now this obviously means
that<00:02:01.710> they<00:02:01.799> weren't<00:02:02.040> really<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:03.149> know

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
that they weren't really you know

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.630 
that they weren't really you know
playing<00:02:03.479> objectively<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.500> that's<00:02:05.399> really

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
playing objectively and that's really

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.399 
playing objectively and that's really
sad<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:06.030> see<00:02:06.180> because<00:02:06.360> domination<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.110> very

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
sad to see because domination is a very

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.229 
sad to see because domination is a very
very<00:02:07.680> team-based<00:02:08.220> game<00:02:08.580> now<00:02:08.759> your<00:02:08.910> team<00:02:09.060> needs

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
very team-based game now your team needs

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.550 
very team-based game now your team needs
to<00:02:09.270> be<00:02:09.360> synchronized<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.229> really<00:02:10.470> need

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
to be synchronized and you really need

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.080 
to be synchronized and you really need
to<00:02:10.649> be<00:02:10.770> going<00:02:10.860> for<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.129> objectives<00:02:11.640> in<00:02:11.879> order

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
to be going for the objectives in order

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.740 
to be going for the objectives in order
to<00:02:12.209> win<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.420> game

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
to win the game

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.890 
to win the game
now<00:02:13.440> we<00:02:13.500> now<00:02:14.070> have<00:02:14.280> lost<00:02:14.490> be<00:02:14.790> once<00:02:15.420> again<00:02:15.570> but

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
now we now have lost be once again but

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.860 
now we now have lost be once again but
as<00:02:16.280> as<00:02:17.280> we<00:02:17.550> saw<00:02:17.700> earlier<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.450> enemy<00:02:18.690> is

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
as as we saw earlier the the enemy is

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.630 
as as we saw earlier the the enemy is
not<00:02:19.050> sending<00:02:19.290> up<00:02:19.410> any<00:02:19.590> defenses<00:02:20.070> so<00:02:20.250> we<00:02:20.400> rush

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
not sending up any defenses so we rush

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.150 
not sending up any defenses so we rush
in<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.030> my<00:02:21.960> teammates<00:02:21.990> looking<00:02:22.740> up<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:22.920> front

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
in and my teammates looking up the front

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.680 
in and my teammates looking up the front
I<00:02:23.310> turn<00:02:23.520> around<00:02:23.790> look<00:02:23.880> at<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.060> back<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:24.300> we

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
I turn around look at the back and we

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.720 
I turn around look at the back and we
pretty<00:02:24.840> much<00:02:24.960> cap<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.410> flag<00:02:25.440> without<00:02:26.310> any

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
pretty much cap the flag without any

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.730 
pretty much cap the flag without any
without<00:02:26.880> any<00:02:27.120> problem<00:02:27.480> so<00:02:27.750> we<00:02:28.290> see<00:02:28.440> two<00:02:28.590> people

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
without any problem so we see two people

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.380 
without any problem so we see two people
coming<00:02:29.010> my<00:02:29.280> team<00:02:29.459> my<00:02:29.640> teammate<00:02:29.880> gets<00:02:30.030> one<00:02:30.180> and

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
coming my team my teammate gets one and

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.670 
coming my team my teammate gets one and
I<00:02:30.420> get<00:02:30.630> this<00:02:30.750> guy<00:02:30.930> coming<00:02:31.170> around<00:02:31.200> this<00:02:31.410> way<00:02:31.470> so

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
I get this guy coming around this way so

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.560 
I get this guy coming around this way so
that's<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.070> very<00:02:32.130> good<00:02:32.340> tactic<00:02:32.820> to<00:02:33.209> capture<00:02:33.540> a

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
that's a very good tactic to capture a

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.090 
that's a very good tactic to capture a
flag<00:02:33.810> just<00:02:34.050> pretty<00:02:34.500> much<00:02:34.620> have<00:02:34.770> each<00:02:34.860> other's

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
flag just pretty much have each other's

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.160 
flag just pretty much have each other's
back<00:02:35.280> now<00:02:35.970> another<00:02:36.209> thing<00:02:36.360> is<00:02:36.630> I've<00:02:36.900> seen<00:02:37.140> a

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
back now another thing is I've seen a

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.780 
back now another thing is I've seen a
lot<00:02:37.260> of<00:02:37.410> people<00:02:37.680> trying<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:37.950> rush<00:02:38.130> into<00:02:38.340> a

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
lot of people trying to rush into a

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.910 
lot of people trying to rush into a
building<00:02:39.360> or<00:02:39.570> you<00:02:40.350> know<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.500> place<00:02:40.620> where<00:02:40.830> the

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
building or you know a place where the

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.010 
building or you know a place where the
flag<00:02:41.160> is<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.550> try<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.730> capture<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.209> but<00:02:42.900> they

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
flag is and try to capture it but they

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.660 
flag is and try to capture it but they
seem<00:02:43.290> to<00:02:43.320> die<00:02:43.590> simply<00:02:44.040> because<00:02:44.370> they<00:02:44.520> don't

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
seem to die simply because they don't

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.170 
seem to die simply because they don't
actually<00:02:45.060> you<00:02:45.300> know<00:02:45.500> really<00:02:46.640> look<00:02:47.640> around<00:02:47.970> for

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
actually you know really look around for

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.790 
actually you know really look around for
someone<00:02:48.360> defending<00:02:48.959> it<00:02:49.080> now<00:02:49.230> if<00:02:49.440> someone's

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
someone defending it now if someone's

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.990 
someone defending it now if someone's
defending<00:02:50.220> and<00:02:50.340> they're<00:02:50.430> going<00:02:50.550> to<00:02:50.610> kill<00:02:50.790> you

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
defending and they're going to kill you

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.460 
defending and they're going to kill you
so<00:02:51.030> if<00:02:51.270> you<00:02:51.330> don't<00:02:51.420> look<00:02:51.630> around<00:02:51.720> properly<00:02:52.230> and

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
so if you don't look around properly and

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.650 
so if you don't look around properly and
don't<00:02:53.100> clear<00:02:53.489> out<00:02:53.520> the<00:02:53.790> enemy<00:02:54.060> before<00:02:54.420> you

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
don't clear out the enemy before you

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.449 
don't clear out the enemy before you
start<00:02:55.140> capturing<00:02:55.380> you<00:02:55.739> will<00:02:55.890> end<00:02:56.040> up<00:02:56.160> dying

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
start capturing you will end up dying

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.100 
start capturing you will end up dying
and<00:02:56.700> you'll<00:02:56.880> just<00:02:57.030> get<00:02:57.180> frustrated<00:02:57.420> so<00:02:57.900> I

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
and you'll just get frustrated so I

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.660 
and you'll just get frustrated so I
would<00:02:58.440> strongly<00:02:58.709> suggest<00:02:58.830> before<00:02:59.400> you<00:02:59.459> start

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
would strongly suggest before you start

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.280 
would strongly suggest before you start
capturing<00:02:59.850> a<00:03:00.060> flag<00:03:00.300> just<00:03:00.840> have<00:03:01.020> a<00:03:01.050> look<00:03:01.170> at

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
capturing a flag just have a look at

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.140 
capturing a flag just have a look at
your<00:03:01.410> UAV<00:03:01.650> just<00:03:02.190> have<00:03:02.400> a<00:03:02.430> little<00:03:02.700> you<00:03:03.090> know

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
your UAV just have a little you know

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.390 
your UAV just have a little you know
careful<00:03:03.690> analysis<00:03:04.590> of<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:04.800> area<00:03:05.070> for<00:03:05.250> any

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
careful analysis of the area for any

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.070 
careful analysis of the area for any
claim<00:03:05.610> walls<00:03:05.850> or<00:03:06.060> any<00:03:06.180> enemy<00:03:06.510> equipment<00:03:06.630> and

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
claim walls or any enemy equipment and

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.870 
claim walls or any enemy equipment and
then<00:03:07.590> go<00:03:07.800> on<00:03:07.830> for<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.100> capture<00:03:08.310> otherwise<00:03:08.700> you

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
then go on for the capture otherwise you

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.340 
then go on for the capture otherwise you
will<00:03:08.940> just<00:03:09.060> end<00:03:09.300> up<00:03:09.360> dying<00:03:09.660> a<00:03:09.780> lot<00:03:09.930> of<00:03:10.020> the<00:03:10.110> time

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
will just end up dying a lot of the time

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.040 
will just end up dying a lot of the time
especially<00:03:10.920> um<00:03:11.550> because<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.360> manner<00:03:12.780> the

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
especially um because the manner the

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.540 
especially um because the manner the
radio<00:03:13.320> tells<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.830> enemy<00:03:14.040> team<00:03:14.190> that<00:03:14.370> they're

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
radio tells the enemy team that they're

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:15.949 
radio tells the enemy team that they're
losing<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.880> flag<00:03:15.120> which<00:03:15.360> is<00:03:15.540> really<00:03:15.720> annoying

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
losing the flag which is really annoying

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.289 
losing the flag which is really annoying
at<00:03:16.140> times<00:03:16.170> because<00:03:16.650> if<00:03:17.310> you're<00:03:17.760> trying<00:03:17.940> to<00:03:18.060> go

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
at times because if you're trying to go

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.840 
at times because if you're trying to go
for<00:03:18.420> a<00:03:18.480> sneaky<00:03:18.810> capture<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:20.130> enemy<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.820> enemy

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
for a sneaky capture the enemy the enemy

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.160 
for a sneaky capture the enemy the enemy
pretty<00:03:21.180> much<00:03:21.269> as<00:03:21.390> finds<00:03:21.720> out<00:03:21.870> so<00:03:21.989> it's<00:03:22.080> pretty

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
pretty much as finds out so it's pretty

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.710 
pretty much as finds out so it's pretty
much<00:03:22.290> not<00:03:22.620> really<00:03:22.890> any<00:03:23.360> benefit<00:03:24.360> in<00:03:24.390> doing

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
much not really any benefit in doing

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.120 
much not really any benefit in doing
that<00:03:24.840> but<00:03:25.019> um<00:03:25.200> guys<00:03:25.560> I<00:03:25.650> want<00:03:25.769> to<00:03:25.830> talk<00:03:25.950> a<00:03:25.980> little

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
that but um guys I want to talk a little

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.160 
that but um guys I want to talk a little
bit<00:03:26.340> about<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.549> killstreaks<00:03:27.150> now<00:03:27.390> so<00:03:28.049> the

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
bit about the killstreaks now so the

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.630 
bit about the killstreaks now so the
killstreaks<00:03:28.620> that<00:03:28.739> i'm<00:03:28.830> using<00:03:29.100> this<00:03:29.220> game<00:03:29.459> is

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
killstreaks that i'm using this game is

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.920 
killstreaks that i'm using this game is
a<00:03:29.670> spy<00:03:30.000> plane<00:03:30.030> in<00:03:30.299> the<00:03:30.390> black<00:03:30.600> bear<00:03:30.810> in<00:03:30.870> the

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
a spy plane in the black bear in the

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.410 
a spy plane in the black bear in the
chapel<00:03:31.230> ghana<00:03:31.410> the<00:03:31.980> spy<00:03:32.190> plane<00:03:32.459> is<00:03:32.610> incredibly

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
chapel ghana the spy plane is incredibly

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.150 
chapel ghana the spy plane is incredibly
incredibly<00:03:33.870> crucial<00:03:34.170> because<00:03:34.470> even<00:03:35.010> though

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
incredibly crucial because even though

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.830 
incredibly crucial because even though
someone<00:03:35.519> may<00:03:35.670> have<00:03:35.700> ghost<00:03:36.120> you<00:03:36.540> pretty<00:03:36.780> much

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
someone may have ghost you pretty much

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.050 
someone may have ghost you pretty much
know<00:03:37.260> where<00:03:37.500> they're<00:03:37.739> spawning<00:03:38.060> especially

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
know where they're spawning especially

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.910 
know where they're spawning especially
in<00:03:39.120> domination<00:03:39.450> so<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:40.080> spy<00:03:40.290> planes<00:03:40.560> pretty

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
in domination so the spy planes pretty

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.470 
in domination so the spy planes pretty
much<00:03:41.040> gives<00:03:41.250> you<00:03:41.370> a<00:03:41.400> vague<00:03:41.790> idea<00:03:42.000> where

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
much gives you a vague idea where

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.789 
much gives you a vague idea where
they're<00:03:42.630> coming<00:03:42.810> from<00:03:42.930> even<00:03:43.410> if<00:03:43.530> they<00:03:43.650> may

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
they're coming from even if they may

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.650 
they're coming from even if they may
have<00:03:43.920> ghost<00:03:44.190> now<00:03:44.700> relying<00:03:45.090> upon<00:03:45.239> your<00:03:45.480> spy

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
have ghost now relying upon your spy

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.509 
have ghost now relying upon your spy
plane<00:03:45.870> too<00:03:46.079> much<00:03:46.290> is<00:03:46.530> really<00:03:46.950> bad<00:03:47.100> because<00:03:47.489> a

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
plane too much is really bad because a

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:48.949 
plane too much is really bad because a
lot<00:03:47.790> of<00:03:47.820> people<00:03:47.910> do<00:03:48.269> use<00:03:48.450> girls<00:03:48.720> these<00:03:48.900> days

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
lot of people do use girls these days

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.110 
lot of people do use girls these days
that's<00:03:49.410> why<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:50.160> Blackbird<00:03:50.700> is<00:03:50.730> just<00:03:51.030> an

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
that's why the Blackbird is just an

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.789 
that's why the Blackbird is just an
amazing<00:03:51.329> kill<00:03:51.690> streak<00:03:51.959> so<00:03:52.170> right<00:03:52.350> there<00:03:52.380> I

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
amazing kill streak so right there I

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.470 
amazing kill streak so right there I
pretty<00:03:52.980> much<00:03:53.100> just<00:03:53.190> get<00:03:53.489> my<00:03:53.640> arm<00:03:53.970> chopper

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
pretty much just get my arm chopper

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.090 
pretty much just get my arm chopper

exactly what the enemy are now I die
over<00:04:05.700> here<00:04:06.120> because<00:04:06.360> it's<00:04:06.510> bad<00:04:06.690> shooting<00:04:07.049> and

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
over here because it's bad shooting and

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.110 
the reason I'm using trouble gunner in
domination<00:04:10.739> is<00:04:10.980> because<00:04:11.310> I'm<00:04:11.519> firstly<00:04:11.970> you

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
domination is because I'm firstly you

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.460 
domination is because I'm firstly you
can<00:04:12.150> get<00:04:12.360> a<00:04:12.390> lot<00:04:12.510> of<00:04:12.570> kills<00:04:12.840> in<00:04:12.959> the<00:04:13.019> spawn<00:04:13.260> trap

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
can get a lot of kills in the spawn trap

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.350 
can get a lot of kills in the spawn trap
the<00:04:13.560> enemy<00:04:13.769> team<00:04:13.950> but<00:04:14.489> also<00:04:14.670> you<00:04:14.880> can<00:04:15.000> help<00:04:15.180> out

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
the enemy team but also you can help out

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.060 
the enemy team but also you can help out
pretty<00:04:16.049> much<00:04:16.140> what<00:04:16.320> you<00:04:16.380> do<00:04:16.500> is<00:04:16.709> you<00:04:16.829> get<00:04:16.950> your

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
pretty much what you do is you get your

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.219 
pretty much what you do is you get your
teammate<00:04:17.430> to<00:04:17.519> be<00:04:17.640> on<00:04:17.729> the<00:04:17.820> ground<00:04:18.060> and<00:04:18.299> capping

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
teammate to be on the ground and capping

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:20.599 
teammate to be on the ground and capping
flags<00:04:19.500> and<00:04:19.769> you<00:04:19.829> pretty<00:04:20.010> much<00:04:20.070> to<00:04:20.280> suppress

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
flags and you pretty much to suppress

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.460 
flags and you pretty much to suppress
the<00:04:20.789> enemy<00:04:20.940> team<00:04:21.239> into<00:04:21.510> their<00:04:21.630> spawn<00:04:21.870> while

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
the enemy team into their spawn while

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.050 
the enemy team into their spawn while
your<00:04:22.800> teammates<00:04:23.160> go<00:04:23.340> and<00:04:23.490> capture<00:04:23.640> the<00:04:23.789> flags

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
your teammates go and capture the flags

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.970 
your teammates go and capture the flags
now<00:04:24.330> in<00:04:24.930> this<00:04:25.050> some<00:04:25.320> in<00:04:25.560> this<00:04:25.710> little

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
now in this some in this little

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.920 
now in this some in this little
in<00:04:26.370> this<00:04:26.550> game<00:04:26.760> it<00:04:27.000> was<00:04:27.180> pretty<00:04:27.330> useless

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
in this game it was pretty useless

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.810 
in this game it was pretty useless
because<00:04:28.200> um<00:04:28.560> we<00:04:28.860> were<00:04:28.950> already<00:04:29.130> dominating

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
because um we were already dominating

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.340 
because um we were already dominating
the<00:04:29.910> enemy<00:04:30.120> team<00:04:30.300> so<00:04:30.540> I<00:04:30.570> just<00:04:30.780> went<00:04:30.960> for<00:04:31.050> kills

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
the enemy team so I just went for kills

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.020 
the enemy team so I just went for kills
which<00:04:31.560> is<00:04:31.680> perfectly<00:04:32.040> fine<00:04:32.130> in<00:04:32.430> my<00:04:32.520> opinion<00:04:32.820> if

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
which is perfectly fine in my opinion if

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.400 
which is perfectly fine in my opinion if
you<00:04:33.120> guys<00:04:33.300> are<00:04:33.480> playing<00:04:33.570> objectively<00:04:34.110> going

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
you guys are playing objectively going

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.440 
you guys are playing objectively going
for<00:04:34.560> kills<00:04:34.770> is<00:04:34.980> not<00:04:35.520> a<00:04:35.550> problem<00:04:35.820> just<00:04:36.240> as<00:04:36.360> long

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
for kills is not a problem just as long

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.450 
for kills is not a problem just as long
as<00:04:36.690> you<00:04:36.900> know<00:04:37.200> still<00:04:37.500> defend<00:04:38.010> and<00:04:38.190> capture

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
as you know still defend and capture

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.610 
as you know still defend and capture
flags<00:04:38.700> and<00:04:39.300> right<00:04:39.480> there<00:04:39.690> you<00:04:39.810> see<00:04:40.110> this<00:04:40.350> man

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
flags and right there you see this man

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.200 
flags and right there you see this man
checking<00:04:40.980> a<00:04:41.160> smoke<00:04:41.430> grenade<00:04:41.460> and<00:04:41.880> trying<00:04:42.150> to

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
checking a smoke grenade and trying to

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.910 
checking a smoke grenade and trying to
capture<00:04:42.390> B<00:04:42.690> which<00:04:42.930> is<00:04:42.960> really<00:04:43.410> really<00:04:43.650> good

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
capture B which is really really good

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.190 
capture B which is really really good
little<00:04:44.250> tactic<00:04:44.730> but<00:04:44.940> if<00:04:45.360> he<00:04:45.600> had<00:04:45.720> just<00:04:45.990> checked

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
little tactic but if he had just checked

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.230 
little tactic but if he had just checked
this<00:04:46.350> marinated<00:04:46.890> a<00:04:46.980> little<00:04:47.280> bit<00:04:47.400> further<00:04:47.880> on

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
this marinated a little bit further on

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.060 
this marinated a little bit further on
covering<00:04:49.080> the<00:04:49.170> whole<00:04:49.290> of<00:04:49.320> BI<00:04:49.620> probably

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
covering the whole of BI probably

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.740 
covering the whole of BI probably
wouldn't<00:04:50.340> have<00:04:50.430> been<00:04:50.880> able<00:04:51.000> to<00:04:51.180> see<00:04:51.390> him<00:04:51.570> and

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
wouldn't have been able to see him and

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.000 
wouldn't have been able to see him and
he<00:04:51.870> probably<00:04:52.080> would<00:04:52.320> have<00:04:52.380> gotten<00:04:52.650> away<00:04:52.740> with

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
he probably would have gotten away with

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.010 
he probably would have gotten away with
the<00:04:53.100> capture<00:04:53.340> now<00:04:54.180> he<00:04:54.240> didn't<00:04:54.570> do<00:04:54.630> that<00:04:54.780> so<00:04:54.990> I

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
the capture now he didn't do that so I

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.360 
the capture now he didn't do that so I
was<00:04:55.230> able<00:04:55.350> to<00:04:55.440> defend<00:04:55.680> a<00:04:55.770> flag<00:04:55.980> pretty<00:04:56.220> easily

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
was able to defend a flag pretty easily

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.100 
was able to defend a flag pretty easily
but<00:04:56.580> now<00:04:56.940> you<00:04:57.000> guys<00:04:57.210> say<00:04:57.480> that<00:04:57.750> they've<00:04:57.900> taken

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
but now you guys say that they've taken

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.380 
but now you guys say that they've taken
see<00:04:58.500> again<00:04:58.770> so<00:04:59.640> they<00:04:59.760> are<00:04:59.820> making<00:05:00.060> an<00:05:00.270> effort

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
see again so they are making an effort

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:01.790 
see again so they are making an effort
but<00:05:00.660> they're<00:05:00.810> not<00:05:00.900> defending<00:05:01.380> it<00:05:01.470> very<00:05:01.650> well

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
but they're not defending it very well

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.830 
but they're not defending it very well
as<00:05:01.950> you<00:05:02.070> guys<00:05:02.160> can<00:05:02.310> see<00:05:02.370> so<00:05:03.120> my<00:05:03.270> friend<00:05:03.570> calls

as you guys can see so my friend calls

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.360 
as you guys can see so my friend calls
in<00:05:03.960> his<00:05:03.990> chopper<00:05:04.260> gunner<00:05:04.500> and<00:05:04.740> he<00:05:05.040> provides

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
in his chopper gunner and he provides

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.430 
in his chopper gunner and he provides
excellent<00:05:05.880> support<00:05:06.330> from<00:05:06.540> above<00:05:06.810> and<00:05:07.080> look<00:05:07.320> at

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
excellent support from above and look at

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.960 
excellent support from above and look at
this<00:05:07.530> he<00:05:07.740> pretty<00:05:08.010> much<00:05:08.100> covers<00:05:08.550> me<00:05:08.670> from

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
this he pretty much covers me from

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.210 
this he pretty much covers me from
taking<00:05:09.090> see<00:05:09.420> and<00:05:09.660> he<00:05:10.500> kills<00:05:10.740> everyone<00:05:10.980> there

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
taking see and he kills everyone there

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.860 
taking see and he kills everyone there
and<00:05:11.370> gives<00:05:11.580> me<00:05:11.700> a<00:05:11.730> pretty<00:05:11.970> easy<00:05:12.240> flag<00:05:12.600> capture

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
and gives me a pretty easy flag capture

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.020 
and gives me a pretty easy flag capture
and<00:05:13.200> my<00:05:13.350> teammates<00:05:13.710> come<00:05:13.950> to<00:05:14.040> help<00:05:14.160> me<00:05:14.220> out<00:05:14.310> so

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.230 
I kept just say and now we have C and B
and<00:05:17.190> we're<00:05:17.340> pretty<00:05:17.490> much<00:05:17.610> set<00:05:17.880> so<00:05:18.060> I'm<00:05:18.120> just

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
and we're pretty much set so I'm just

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.030 
and we're pretty much set so I'm just
gonna<00:05:18.330> speed<00:05:18.750> this<00:05:18.900> little<00:05:19.290> bit<00:05:19.410> up<00:05:19.560> because

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
gonna speed this little bit up because

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.350 
gonna speed this little bit up because
I'm<00:05:20.130> just<00:05:20.250> looking<00:05:20.520> around<00:05:20.610> for<00:05:20.910> where<00:05:21.210> the

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
I'm just looking around for where the

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.150 
I'm just looking around for where the
enemy<00:05:21.570> team<00:05:21.690> are<00:05:21.840> spawning<00:05:22.160> they're

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
enemy team are spawning they're

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.560 
enemy team are spawning they're
obviously<00:05:23.370> not<00:05:23.460> progressing<00:05:24.330> out<00:05:24.420> of<00:05:24.510> the

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
obviously not progressing out of the

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:25.790 
obviously not progressing out of the
spawn<00:05:24.810> point<00:05:25.080> because<00:05:25.350> of<00:05:25.530> the<00:05:25.590> chopper

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
spawn point because of the chopper

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.290 
spawn point because of the chopper
gunner<00:05:26.070> so<00:05:26.310> I<00:05:26.340> just<00:05:26.520> be<00:05:26.670> this<00:05:26.790> little<00:05:26.970> bit<00:05:27.180> up

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
gunner so I just be this little bit up

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.290

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
spawning out of the hot now now if I

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.530

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:51.540

killing them as they spawned out of here

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:54.650 
killing them as they spawned out of here
they<00:05:53.610> probably<00:05:53.880> would<00:05:54.090> have<00:05:54.150> captured<00:05:54.390> me

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660 
they probably would have captured me

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.150 
they probably would have captured me
again<00:05:54.900> but<00:05:55.080> since<00:05:55.320> I<00:05:55.410> was<00:05:55.560> here<00:05:55.680> and<00:05:55.860> I<00:05:55.920> killed

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 
again but since I was here and I killed

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.250 
again but since I was here and I killed
him<00:05:56.280> as<00:05:56.400> they<00:05:56.520> came<00:05:56.640> out<00:05:56.700> of<00:05:56.820> the<00:05:56.940> heart<00:05:57.260> we

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:59.750 
him as they came out of the heart we
were<00:05:58.590> able<00:05:58.740> to<00:05:58.890> save<00:05:59.070> me<00:05:59.220> once<00:05:59.400> again<00:05:59.490> so<00:05:59.730> that

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
were able to save me once again so that

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.920 
were able to save me once again so that

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 
of the heart because he's too scared of

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.590 
of the heart because he's too scared of
the<00:06:02.280> chopper<00:06:02.520> gunner<00:06:02.700> so<00:06:02.880> I<00:06:02.910> leave<00:06:03.150> him<00:06:03.270> then<00:06:03.420> I
