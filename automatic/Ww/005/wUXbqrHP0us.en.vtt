harbor<00:03:36.260> which<00:03:36.410> I<00:03:36.560> cost<00:03:37.040> like<00:03:37.190> nonsense<00:03:37.820> so<00:03:38.090> I

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
harbor which I cost like nonsense so I

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.850 
harbor which I cost like nonsense so I
guess<00:03:38.300> that's<00:03:38.480> that's<00:03:39.260> the<00:03:39.410> hook<00:03:39.560> and<00:03:39.769> of

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
guess that's that's the hook and of

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.290 
guess that's that's the hook and of
course<00:03:40.040> there's<00:03:40.280> new<00:03:40.400> levels<00:03:40.700> coming<00:03:40.970> soon<00:03:41.150> as
