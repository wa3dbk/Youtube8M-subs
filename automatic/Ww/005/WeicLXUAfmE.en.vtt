over<00:01:22.229> mint<00:01:22.470> green<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:23.310> basically<00:01:23.610> i'm<00:01:23.759> just

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
over mint green so basically i'm just

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.719 
over mint green so basically i'm just
going<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.180> take<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.659> polish<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.380> paint<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.430> co

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
going to take the polish and paint a co

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.429 
going to take the polish and paint a co
on<00:01:26.939> here<00:01:29.659> now<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:30.720> kind<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.049> have<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.229> work

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
on here now you kind of have to work

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.380 
on here now you kind of have to work
quickly<00:01:31.470> with<00:01:31.979> this<00:01:32.130> because<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.700> does<00:01:33.000> start

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
quickly with this because it does start

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:41.719 
quickly with this because it does start
doing<00:01:33.750> its<00:01:33.930> thing<00:01:34.860> really<00:01:35.159> quickly<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:40.729> that's

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
doing its thing really quickly so that's

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.539 
doing its thing really quickly so that's
good<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.360> i<00:01:42.840> will<00:01:43.079> just<00:01:43.829> stay<00:01:44.130> here<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.369> wait

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
good and i will just stay here and wait

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.690 
good and i will just stay here and wait
for<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:44.909> start<00:01:45.030> cracking<00:01:46.130> it<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.310> sort<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.610> a

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
for it to start cracking it is sort of a

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.760 
for it to start cracking it is sort of a
thicker<00:01:47.970> polish<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.780> kind<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.079> goes<00:01:49.530> on<00:01:49.740> a

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
thicker polish so it kind of goes on a

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.249 
thicker polish so it kind of goes on a
little<00:01:49.979> bit<00:01:50.189> goopy<00:01:50.520> but<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:51.509> ends<00:01:51.720> up<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:52.049> works

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
little bit goopy but it ends up it works

00:01:52.259 --> 00:02:01.160 
little bit goopy but it ends up it works
for<00:01:53.159> what<00:01:53.369> we're<00:01:53.520> doing

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.330 

alright<00:02:02.170> so<00:02:02.350> there's<00:02:02.560> a<00:02:02.619> close-up<00:02:03.100> shot<00:02:03.310> of

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
alright so there's a close-up shot of

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.679 
alright so there's a close-up shot of
what<00:02:03.549> that<00:02:03.640> nail<00:02:03.880> looks<00:02:04.060> like<00:02:04.299> this<00:02:04.509> dries

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
what that nail looks like this dries

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.990 
what that nail looks like this dries
really<00:02:05.080> fast<00:02:05.229> and<00:02:05.860> it<00:02:06.340> dries<00:02:06.520> a<00:02:06.549> little<00:02:06.670> bit

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
really fast and it dries a little bit

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.760 
really fast and it dries a little bit
mess<00:02:07.210> so<00:02:07.479> you<00:02:07.540> will<00:02:07.780> probably<00:02:08.020> want<00:02:08.259> to<00:02:08.500> put<00:02:08.590> a

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
mess so you will probably want to put a

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.490 
mess so you will probably want to put a
top<00:02:09.009> coat<00:02:09.220> on<00:02:09.369> afterwards<00:02:10.200> alright<00:02:11.200> so<00:02:11.380> the

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
top coat on afterwards alright so the

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.809 
top coat on afterwards alright so the
next<00:02:11.530> color<00:02:11.920> I'm<00:02:12.040> going<00:02:12.099> to<00:02:12.250> try<00:02:12.430> it<00:02:12.459> on<00:02:12.580> is

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
next color I'm going to try it on is

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.809 
next color I'm going to try it on is
this<00:02:13.030> dark<00:02:13.840> silver<00:02:14.200> glitter<00:02:14.590> one<00:02:15.239> and<00:02:16.470> just

I can really appreciate anyone that does
meal<00:02:32.170> tutorials<00:02:32.710> because<00:02:32.830> it<00:02:33.069> is<00:02:33.190> very<00:02:33.550> hard

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
meal tutorials because it is very hard

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.130 
meal tutorials because it is very hard
to<00:02:34.890> paint<00:02:35.890> with<00:02:36.130> the<00:02:36.280> viewfinder<00:02:36.760> now<00:02:37.750> this<00:02:37.959> is

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
to paint with the viewfinder now this is

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.600 
to paint with the viewfinder now this is
a<00:02:38.170> little<00:02:38.410> bit<00:02:38.590> thicker<00:02:38.800> of<00:02:38.980> a<00:02:39.069> polish<00:02:39.459> and

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
a little bit thicker of a polish and

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.190 
a little bit thicker of a polish and
it's<00:02:39.700> textured<00:02:40.240> so<00:02:40.420> I'm<00:02:40.510> not<00:02:40.690> sure<00:02:40.750> if<00:02:40.990> this<00:02:41.140> is

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
it's textured so I'm not sure if this is

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.930 
it's textured so I'm not sure if this is
actually<00:02:41.650> going<00:02:41.800> to<00:02:41.920> work<00:02:42.100> because<00:02:42.640> it

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
actually going to work because it

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.490 
actually going to work because it
doesn't<00:02:43.450> really<00:02:43.569> look<00:02:43.750> like<00:02:43.810> is<00:02:43.990> working<00:02:44.319> too

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
doesn't really look like is working too

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.740 
doesn't really look like is working too
well<00:02:44.530> I<00:02:44.890> don't<00:02:45.700> know<00:02:45.819> if<00:02:45.940> it's<00:02:46.060> cracking<00:02:46.540> but

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
well I don't know if it's cracking but

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.380 
well I don't know if it's cracking but
it<00:02:46.870> it<00:02:47.170> just<00:02:47.380> looks<00:02:47.530> gross<00:02:47.770> oh<00:02:48.240> here<00:02:49.240> we<00:02:49.270> go

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
it it just looks gross oh here we go

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.930 
it it just looks gross oh here we go
here<00:02:49.600> goes<00:02:51.209> took<00:02:52.209> a<00:02:52.240> little<00:02:52.420> extra<00:02:52.630> time<00:02:53.910> but<00:02:54.910> I

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
here goes took a little extra time but I

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.250 
here goes took a little extra time but I
think<00:02:55.180> like<00:02:55.300> I<00:02:55.360> said<00:02:55.630> because<00:02:55.780> this<00:02:56.080> nail

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
think like I said because this nail

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.600 
think like I said because this nail
polish<00:02:56.410> is<00:02:56.620> a<00:02:56.650> little<00:02:56.890> bit<00:02:56.980> more<00:02:57.100> textured

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
polish is a little bit more textured

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.490 
polish is a little bit more textured
than<00:02:58.330> the<00:02:58.630> first<00:02:58.870> one<00:02:59.020> that<00:02:59.110> I<00:02:59.170> tried<00:02:59.470> that

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
than the first one that I tried that

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.530 
than the first one that I tried that
it's<00:02:59.860> going<00:03:00.130> to<00:03:00.310> just<00:03:00.640> take<00:03:00.880> a<00:03:00.940> little<00:03:01.120> bit<00:03:01.300> a

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
it's going to just take a little bit a

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.979 
it's going to just take a little bit a
little<00:03:01.950> bit<00:03:02.950> more<00:03:03.160> okay<00:03:04.060> so<00:03:04.120> now<00:03:04.330> this<00:03:04.510> one<00:03:04.720> did

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
little bit more okay so now this one did

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.440 
little bit more okay so now this one did
crack<00:03:05.350> but<00:03:05.709> not<00:03:06.100> as<00:03:06.280> well<00:03:06.489> as<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:06.970> smoother

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
crack but not as well as the smoother

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.380 
crack but not as well as the smoother
polish<00:03:07.810> so<00:03:08.050> i<00:03:08.080> guess<00:03:08.380> i<00:03:08.500> would<00:03:08.560> say<00:03:09.239> if<00:03:10.239> you

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
polish so i guess i would say if you

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.120 
polish so i guess i would say if you
have<00:03:10.510> a<00:03:10.540> textured<00:03:10.959> polish<00:03:11.290> to<00:03:11.560> kind<00:03:11.860> of<00:03:11.920> layer

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
have a textured polish to kind of layer

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.860 
have a textured polish to kind of layer
on<00:03:12.340> some<00:03:12.550> top<00:03:12.790> coat<00:03:12.820> or<00:03:13.150> something<00:03:13.269> i<00:03:13.510> did<00:03:13.690> put

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
on some top coat or something i did put

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.259 
on some top coat or something i did put
one<00:03:14.140> coat<00:03:14.320> of<00:03:14.380> top<00:03:14.650> coat<00:03:14.830> on<00:03:14.980> top<00:03:15.010> of<00:03:15.340> this<00:03:15.519> but

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
one coat of top coat on top of this but

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.150 
one coat of top coat on top of this but
it<00:03:16.630> doesn't<00:03:17.110> really<00:03:17.200> seem<00:03:17.530> to<00:03:17.709> have<00:03:17.890> helped

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
it doesn't really seem to have helped

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:24.660 
it doesn't really seem to have helped
the<00:03:18.370> cause<00:03:18.519> very<00:03:18.850> much<00:03:19.060> oh<00:03:19.330> oh<00:03:21.870> ha<00:03:22.870> jeez<00:03:23.519> so<00:03:24.519> now

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
the cause very much oh oh ha jeez so now

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.310 
the cause very much oh oh ha jeez so now
with<00:03:24.820> that<00:03:24.850> experiment<00:03:25.750> i<00:03:25.900> think<00:03:26.110> i'm<00:03:26.200> going

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
with that experiment i think i'm going

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.560 
with that experiment i think i'm going
to<00:03:26.410> apply<00:03:26.500> a<00:03:26.709> little<00:03:27.670> bit<00:03:27.760> of<00:03:27.880> top<00:03:28.300> coat<00:03:28.510> to

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
to apply a little bit of top coat to

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.900 
to apply a little bit of top coat to
this<00:03:29.019> nail<00:03:29.290> because<00:03:29.530> although<00:03:30.400> this<00:03:30.700> is<00:03:30.880> a

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
this nail because although this is a

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.060 
this nail because although this is a
smoother<00:03:31.390> glitter<00:03:31.720> it<00:03:31.930> does<00:03:32.200> have<00:03:32.860> a<00:03:32.890> little

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
smoother glitter it does have a little

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.500 
smoother glitter it does have a little
bit<00:03:33.190> of<00:03:33.280> texture<00:03:33.670> too<00:03:33.940> and<00:03:34.150> i<00:03:34.209> want<00:03:34.360> to<00:03:34.420> make

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
bit of texture too and i want to make

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.060 
bit of texture too and i want to make
sure<00:03:34.570> that<00:03:34.780> the<00:03:35.170> black<00:03:35.380> really<00:03:35.680> pulls<00:03:35.920> apart

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
sure that the black really pulls apart

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.259 
sure that the black really pulls apart
on<00:03:36.340> this<00:03:36.459> so<00:03:36.640> I'm<00:03:36.700> just<00:03:36.760> going<00:03:36.970> to<00:03:37.030> go<00:03:37.090> ahead

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
on this so I'm just going to go ahead

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.140 
on this so I'm just going to go ahead
with<00:03:37.630> my<00:03:37.840> favorite<00:03:38.230> top<00:03:38.410> coat<00:03:38.850> and<00:03:39.850> I'm<00:03:40.000> just

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
with my favorite top coat and I'm just

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.220 
with my favorite top coat and I'm just
going<00:03:40.299> to<00:03:40.329> apply<00:03:40.480> some<00:03:40.780> of<00:03:40.870> that<00:03:41.079> I'll

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
going to apply some of that I'll

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.110 
going to apply some of that I'll
probably<00:03:41.440> do<00:03:41.890> two<00:03:42.190> coats<00:03:42.400> of<00:03:42.579> top<00:03:42.790> coat<00:03:42.940> and

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
probably do two coats of top coat and

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.030 
probably do two coats of top coat and
wait<00:03:43.209> for<00:03:43.390> it<00:03:43.450> to<00:03:43.480> dry<00:03:43.570> before<00:03:44.019> i<00:03:44.380> put<00:03:44.860> the

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
wait for it to dry before i put the

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.610 
wait for it to dry before i put the
shadow<00:03:45.280> polish<00:03:45.640> on<00:03:46.170> alright<00:03:47.170> so<00:03:47.320> now<00:03:47.470> that

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
shadow polish on alright so now that

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.080 
shadow polish on alright so now that
I've<00:03:47.709> given<00:03:47.860> that<00:03:48.010> some<00:03:48.310> time<00:03:48.489> to<00:03:48.640> try<00:03:48.880> let's

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
I've given that some time to try let's

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.580 
I've given that some time to try let's
go<00:03:49.239> ahead<00:03:49.329> and<00:03:49.450> put<00:03:49.690> the<00:03:49.780> black<00:03:50.019> on<00:03:50.230> top<00:03:50.380> of

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
go ahead and put the black on top of

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.690 
go ahead and put the black on top of
this<00:03:51.450> now<00:03:52.450> I<00:03:52.480> saw<00:03:52.900> this<00:03:53.110> in<00:03:53.290> the<00:03:53.320> promo<00:03:53.769> pics<00:03:54.070> so

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
this now I saw this in the promo pics so

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.160 
this now I saw this in the promo pics so
I'm<00:03:54.970> hoping<00:03:55.360> that<00:03:55.510> this<00:03:55.720> looks<00:03:55.959> halfway

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
I'm hoping that this looks halfway

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.590 
I'm hoping that this looks halfway
decent<00:03:56.739> lighting<00:03:57.459> just<00:03:57.700> got<00:03:57.910> weird<00:04:00.600> we're

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
decent lighting just got weird we're

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.910 
decent lighting just got weird we're
trying<00:04:01.810> to<00:04:01.870> put<00:04:01.959> a<00:04:01.989> little<00:04:02.140> bit<00:04:02.320> less<00:04:02.530> on<00:04:02.739> this

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
trying to put a little bit less on this

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.380 
trying to put a little bit less on this
one<00:04:03.100> because<00:04:03.280> the<00:04:03.790> other<00:04:03.940> one<00:04:04.060> i<00:04:04.090> think<00:04:04.299> i<00:04:04.360> just

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
one because the other one i think i just

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.770 
one because the other one i think i just
put<00:04:04.690> too<00:04:04.810> much<00:04:06.030> so<00:04:07.030> that<00:04:07.180> one's<00:04:07.329> cracking<00:04:07.720> a

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
put too much so that one's cracking a

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:08.819 
put too much so that one's cracking a
little<00:04:07.810> bit<00:04:08.110> better<00:04:08.200> i'm<00:04:08.440> sure<00:04:08.620> it's<00:04:08.769> a

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829 
little bit better i'm sure it's a

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:10.199 
little bit better i'm sure it's a
mixture<00:04:09.070> between<00:04:09.160> having<00:04:09.790> a<00:04:09.850> smoother

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
mixture between having a smoother

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.470 
mixture between having a smoother
surface<00:04:10.299> and<00:04:10.989> also<00:04:11.530> doing<00:04:12.070> a<00:04:12.130> thinner<00:04:12.400> coat<00:04:12.730> so

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
surface and also doing a thinner coat so

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.970 
surface and also doing a thinner coat so
i<00:04:13.540> would<00:04:13.840> definitely<00:04:13.870> say<00:04:14.350> that<00:04:14.380> those<00:04:14.680> two

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
i would definitely say that those two

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.090 
i would definitely say that those two
are<00:04:15.450> some<00:04:16.450> key<00:04:16.690> points<00:04:16.930> to<00:04:17.200> using<00:04:17.500> this<00:04:17.620> polish

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
are some key points to using this polish

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.699 
are some key points to using this polish
all<00:04:19.060> right<00:04:19.209> so<00:04:19.359> here's<00:04:19.600> a<00:04:19.660> close-up<00:04:20.049> of<00:04:20.410> it

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
all right so here's a close-up of it

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.130 
all right so here's a close-up of it
it's<00:04:20.950> pretty<00:04:21.340> much<00:04:21.519> done<00:04:21.820> i<00:04:21.850> think<00:04:22.240> it's<00:04:22.900> not

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
it's pretty much done i think it's not

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.750 
it's pretty much done i think it's not
as<00:04:23.289> impressive<00:04:23.650> as<00:04:23.950> it<00:04:23.979> looked<00:04:24.280> in<00:04:24.370> the<00:04:24.490> promo

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
as impressive as it looked in the promo

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.820 
as impressive as it looked in the promo
pictures<00:04:25.180> but<00:04:25.900> i<00:04:25.960> think<00:04:26.350> it's<00:04:26.470> just<00:04:26.530> because

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
pictures but i think it's just because

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.800 
pictures but i think it's just because
every<00:04:27.580> time<00:04:27.610> you<00:04:27.880> do<00:04:28.030> it<00:04:28.060> you<00:04:28.270> know<00:04:28.360> every<00:04:28.660> nail

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
every time you do it you know every nail

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.409 
every time you do it you know every nail
cracks<00:04:29.140> differently<00:04:29.710> so<00:04:30.610> this<00:04:30.820> one<00:04:30.970> had<00:04:31.150> kind

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
cracks differently so this one had kind

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.029 
cracks differently so this one had kind
of<00:04:31.479> wider<00:04:31.750> gaps<00:04:32.110> and<00:04:32.320> this<00:04:32.410> one<00:04:32.530> had<00:04:32.650> narrower

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 
of wider gaps and this one had narrower

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:34.529 
of wider gaps and this one had narrower
gaps<00:04:33.280> i<00:04:33.430> think<00:04:33.640> if<00:04:33.729> this<00:04:33.910> one<00:04:34.060> showed<00:04:34.300> through

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539 
gaps i think if this one showed through

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:36.029 
gaps i think if this one showed through
a<00:04:34.600> little<00:04:34.810> bit<00:04:34.840> more<00:04:35.110> it<00:04:35.350> would<00:04:35.440> be<00:04:35.620> cooler

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 
a little bit more it would be cooler

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:37.450 
a little bit more it would be cooler
alright<00:04:36.729> so<00:04:36.850> i<00:04:36.880> have<00:04:37.120> gone

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
alright so i have gone

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.189 
alright so i have gone
hadn't<00:04:37.699> done<00:04:37.850> a<00:04:37.880> top<00:04:38.210> coat<00:04:38.479> as<00:04:38.630> you<00:04:38.750> can<00:04:38.900> see

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 
hadn't done a top coat as you can see

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:41.050 
hadn't done a top coat as you can see
and<00:04:39.470> I<00:04:39.919> think<00:04:39.949> it<00:04:40.220> looks<00:04:40.340> a<00:04:40.430> lot<00:04:40.520> better<00:04:40.729> with<00:04:41.030> a

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
and I think it looks a lot better with a

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.300 
and I think it looks a lot better with a
top<00:04:41.330> coat<00:04:41.360> on<00:04:41.750> it<00:04:41.780> but<00:04:42.380> it's<00:04:42.410> still<00:04:42.949> not<00:04:43.130> as

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
top coat on it but it's still not as

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.159 
top coat on it but it's still not as
impressive<00:04:43.669> as<00:04:43.940> I<00:04:44.060> would<00:04:44.240> have<00:04:44.270> hoped<00:04:44.360> I<00:04:44.900> do

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
impressive as I would have hoped I do

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:46.689 
impressive as I would have hoped I do
like<00:04:45.500> it<00:04:45.710> I<00:04:45.860> think<00:04:45.949> you<00:04:46.160> just<00:04:46.190> kind<00:04:46.460> of<00:04:46.490> have<00:04:46.550> to

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:46.699 
like it I think you just kind of have to

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:48.309 
like it I think you just kind of have to
play<00:04:46.910> around<00:04:47.030> with<00:04:47.389> which<00:04:47.630> polishes<00:04:48.139> it's

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:48.319 
play around with which polishes it's

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:50.650 
play around with which polishes it's
going<00:04:48.470> to<00:04:48.530> look<00:04:48.650> best<00:04:48.889> on<00:04:49.150> so<00:04:50.150> I<00:04:50.180> do<00:04:50.300> think<00:04:50.539> my

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
going to look best on so I do think my

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.150 
going to look best on so I do think my
first<00:04:50.930> one<00:04:51.110> came<00:04:51.259> out<00:04:51.380> the<00:04:51.530> best<00:04:51.740> I<00:04:51.919> think<00:04:51.949> it

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
first one came out the best I think it

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.650 
first one came out the best I think it
looks<00:04:52.190> really<00:04:52.490> awesome<00:04:52.699> over<00:04:53.210> a<00:04:53.240> smooth

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
looks really awesome over a smooth

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.200 
looks really awesome over a smooth
metallic<00:04:54.259> polish<00:04:54.680> and<00:04:54.949> it<00:04:55.550> really<00:04:55.699> separated

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
metallic polish and it really separated

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.379 
metallic polish and it really separated
well<00:04:56.419> with<00:04:56.660> a<00:04:56.690> sin<00:04:57.440> to<00:04:57.470> medium<00:04:58.069> coat<00:04:58.430> the

00:04:59.379 --> 00:04:59.389 
well with a sin to medium coat the

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:01.839 
well with a sin to medium coat the
second<00:04:59.780> one<00:04:59.990> was<00:05:00.319> my<00:05:00.860> least<00:05:01.190> favorite<00:05:01.729> one

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:01.849 
second one was my least favorite one

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:03.279 
second one was my least favorite one
that<00:05:02.000> came<00:05:02.120> out<00:05:02.180> i<00:05:02.300> think<00:05:02.389> that<00:05:02.660> the<00:05:02.780> color<00:05:03.020> was

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:03.289 
that came out i think that the color was

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:05.110 
that came out i think that the color was
a<00:05:03.319> little<00:05:03.710> bit<00:05:03.800> too<00:05:03.979> dark<00:05:04.250> actually<00:05:04.789> to<00:05:04.970> show

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
a little bit too dark actually to show

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.510 
a little bit too dark actually to show
up<00:05:05.210> against<00:05:05.449> the<00:05:05.630> black<00:05:05.870> but<00:05:06.800> also<00:05:06.949> it<00:05:07.370> was

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
up against the black but also it was

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.749 
up against the black but also it was
very<00:05:07.910> gritty<00:05:08.660> and<00:05:08.870> texture<00:05:09.380> and<00:05:09.620> it<00:05:10.190> just<00:05:10.430> I

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:10.759 
very gritty and texture and it just I

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:12.760 
very gritty and texture and it just I
put<00:05:11.360> a<00:05:11.389> really<00:05:11.630> really<00:05:11.750> thick<00:05:12.020> coat<00:05:12.289> on<00:05:12.440> so

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
put a really really thick coat on so

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.800 
put a really really thick coat on so
that<00:05:13.340> one<00:05:13.460> didn't<00:05:13.699> turn<00:05:13.729> out<00:05:13.940> quite<00:05:14.060> so<00:05:14.449> well

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
that one didn't turn out quite so well

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.810 
that one didn't turn out quite so well
but<00:05:15.080> as<00:05:15.259> you<00:05:15.380> can<00:05:15.530> see<00:05:15.830> like<00:05:16.520> it's<00:05:16.669> been

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
but as you can see like it's been

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.550 
but as you can see like it's been
sitting<00:05:16.940> for<00:05:17.180> a<00:05:17.240> little<00:05:17.389> bit<00:05:17.539> longer<00:05:17.780> and<00:05:18.229> it's

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
sitting for a little bit longer and it's

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.900 
sitting for a little bit longer and it's
kind<00:05:18.770> of<00:05:18.800> cracked<00:05:19.099> away<00:05:19.310> a<00:05:19.340> little<00:05:19.520> bit<00:05:19.639> more

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
kind of cracked away a little bit more

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.020 
kind of cracked away a little bit more
and<00:05:20.180> then<00:05:20.240> the<00:05:20.780> last<00:05:20.960> one<00:05:21.229> I<00:05:21.620> think<00:05:21.979> looks<00:05:22.220> cool

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
and then the last one I think looks cool

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.600 
and then the last one I think looks cool
up<00:05:23.270> close<00:05:23.780> but<00:05:24.169> from<00:05:24.830> far<00:05:25.039> away<00:05:25.070> it<00:05:25.250> kind<00:05:25.550> of

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
up close but from far away it kind of

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.969 
up close but from far away it kind of
looks<00:05:25.789> like<00:05:25.880> I<00:05:26.440> know<00:05:27.440> it<00:05:27.680> looks<00:05:27.770> like<00:05:27.949> a

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:27.979 
looks like I know it looks like a

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:29.200 
looks like I know it looks like a
witch's<00:05:28.250> nail<00:05:28.520> or<00:05:28.639> something<00:05:28.729> i'm<00:05:29.000> not<00:05:29.090> sure

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
witch's nail or something i'm not sure

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.450 
witch's nail or something i'm not sure
but<00:05:30.139> it<00:05:30.199> looks<00:05:30.320> so<00:05:30.710> amazing<00:05:30.830> in<00:05:31.400> the

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
but it looks so amazing in the

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:32.620 
but it looks so amazing in the
promotional<00:05:31.909> pictures<00:05:32.060> that<00:05:32.389> i<00:05:32.419> really

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
promotional pictures that i really

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.240 
promotional pictures that i really
wanted<00:05:32.870> to<00:05:32.960> try<00:05:33.199> i<00:05:33.229> think<00:05:33.620> if<00:05:33.710> it<00:05:33.830> had<00:05:33.949> cracked

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
wanted to try i think if it had cracked

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.700 
wanted to try i think if it had cracked
a<00:05:34.400> little<00:05:34.430> bit<00:05:34.699> more<00:05:34.880> and<00:05:35.199> more<00:05:36.199> of<00:05:36.229> the<00:05:36.500> blue

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
a little bit more and more of the blue

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.020 
a little bit more and more of the blue
glitter<00:05:36.889> had<00:05:37.130> shown<00:05:37.370> through<00:05:37.669> that<00:05:37.819> it<00:05:37.909> would

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
glitter had shown through that it would

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.719 
glitter had shown through that it would
have<00:05:38.120> looked<00:05:38.270> a<00:05:38.419> little<00:05:38.599> bit<00:05:38.780> better<00:05:38.870> but<00:05:39.729> it

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:40.729 
have looked a little bit better but it

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:42.790 
have looked a little bit better but it
cracks<00:05:41.120> really<00:05:41.389> randomly<00:05:41.840> so<00:05:42.199> it<00:05:42.470> kind<00:05:42.740> of

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
cracks really randomly so it kind of

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.710 
cracks really randomly so it kind of
can't<00:05:43.009> be<00:05:43.130> sure<00:05:43.340> and<00:05:43.880> of<00:05:44.060> course<00:05:44.090> when<00:05:44.479> you<00:05:44.570> go

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
can't be sure and of course when you go

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.180 
can't be sure and of course when you go
to<00:05:44.780> paint<00:05:44.990> your<00:05:45.110> own<00:05:45.169> nails<00:05:45.470> the<00:05:45.710> polish<00:05:46.009> won't

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
to paint your own nails the polish won't

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:47.469 
to paint your own nails the polish won't
be<00:05:46.310> staggered<00:05:46.729> like<00:05:46.880> this<00:05:47.090> it<00:05:47.210> was<00:05:47.300> just

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 
be staggered like this it was just

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:49.480 
be staggered like this it was just
because<00:05:47.599> I<00:05:47.750> needed<00:05:48.020> a<00:05:48.349> place<00:05:48.979> to<00:05:49.039> hold<00:05:49.370> the

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
because I needed a place to hold the

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.040 
because I needed a place to hold the
nails<00:05:49.669> with<00:05:49.880> the<00:05:49.970> tweezer<00:05:50.300> since<00:05:50.659> I<00:05:50.720> wasn't

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.030 
bit I don't normally film this way but I

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.270 
bit I don't normally film this way but I
like<00:05:59.449> the<00:05:59.690> way<00:05:59.900> that<00:06:00.289> the<00:06:00.500> close-up<00:06:01.009> shots

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 
like the way that the close-up shots

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.980 
like the way that the close-up shots
look<00:06:01.639> so<00:06:02.090> you<00:06:02.180> can<00:06:02.330> see<00:06:02.539> the<00:06:02.659> detail<00:06:02.960> and

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:04.099 
everything like that I just think it's a
