00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:11.280
 Grünbeck presents dell hp the first 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.540
 triple softener with central 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.130
 control valve the delta pi is special 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.650
 for applications with large 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.720
 Consumption quantities suitable she works 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.699
 at the lowest possible pressure loss 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.699
 of less than 0 8 bar 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.779
 It is ideal for large residential complexes 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.940
 building complexes and industrial 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.340
 applications 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.670
 This makes the Delta T very versatile 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.789
 used 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.710
 The design is as simple as ever 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:45.230
 before 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.520
 systems of the delta p series have to 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.829
 not be interpreted 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.110
 Simply select for desired 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.500
 Keep going as easy as they would 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.620
 select a filter 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:01.050
 The pressure loss is so low that he 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.050
 is no longer a design criterion 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.080
 all benefits are based on one 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:10.360
 simple but ingenious innovation that 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.759
 Delta consists of three exchanges 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.420
 bottles and a novel central 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:18.790
 Control valve opposite a plant with 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.229
 two pillars offers the world from edith 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.229
 Double flow performance 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.170
 that is with the same size and 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.060
 lower pressure loss is the 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.120
 Double softening performance to 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.340
 disposal 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.350
 the secret is in the perfect 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.170
 Interplay of the three pillars 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.390
 while two exchange bottles in parallel 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.170
 The water is the 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.150
 third in regeneration 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.370
 the intelligent control technology ensures 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.800
 for that the capacities of the two 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.930
 pillars in operation permanently in the right way 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.540
 namely, relationship to each other 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:59.100
 always shifted to each other by half 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.100
 capacity of a pillar 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.680
 is the processing power of one 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.140
 bottle is exhausted the water 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:10.390
 automatically redirected and a fresh one 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.390
 regenerated column starts work 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:17.360
 the delta t works cyclically in these 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.360
 constant ratio 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.010
 as the first manufacturer worldwide 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.990
 Grünberg a triple plant with a 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.630
 Central three way ball valve 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:31.290
 designed for softening 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.000
 volume and hygiene enticed plant 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.790
 high performance is the kugl valve 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.220
 perfect death space free all areas 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:43.900
 are constantly flowing through it 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:46.620
 never accumulates stagnation water the 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:51.520
 delta always guarantees the plant 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.920
 absolute fresh water by the 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.800
 low pressure loss the simple 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.110
 design and the double performance is 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:03.390
 the del table the solutions for 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.390
 applications with large amounts of consumption 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.600
 Grünbeck water is our passion
