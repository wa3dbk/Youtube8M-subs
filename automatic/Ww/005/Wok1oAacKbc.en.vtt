00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:16.570
 Now, sellers are right. I'll play swipes. 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:21.880
 Now, this feature is a great feature 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:26.910
 I'll let you feel once through the original game about the effects of double speed effects. 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.910
 I'll play once a week in the first day of the trip. 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:00.770
 I played like that in the poplar mouth, and now the multiplication is the highest 8x 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.770
 I'll try to play once. 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:36.770
 I think it's a little quicker when I beat eight horses. 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:38.240
 But it seemed to react more quickly to destroy it or control but gameplay 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:44.510
 When 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:49.070
 Opha way change planning a garage body that big a difference this great feeling 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:52.670
 3 When I played the game 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:55.940
 I ve never will be such a big difference to nwaya 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:02:01.250
 8 when I think that I react more quickly 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:05.350
 I want to stop moving in the direction I want to move . 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.350
 I think I'm responding more quickly. 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:15.920
 When it 's not that big a difference, yeah, 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:21.380
 I can not feel this big body of crib playing the game. 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.980
 Vena is the wood but one common and five feet a little program to create a word Bard 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.270
 When you 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:29.030
 When I set it up, I feel a lot of sense. 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:32.030
 I think it feels so good. 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:36.440
 I think you'll feel it . 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.120
 And now this deulja Now You take off the skin when the audience World Games 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:45.280
 At the place 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:45.280
 It sounds like you're playing harder and harder . 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:51.440
 Yes sound 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.410
 There's a giggling sound. 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:58.220
 I'll need him as the objective would slap 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:02.450
 Lost slap sound effects and sound and 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:06.530
 I learned a lot of warmth from other people 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:11.290
 I think Esther's celebration is much different. 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.290
 But when I played this game 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:20.870
 Personally, I do not think candidates are so big. It's okay. 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.420
 I am going to write my first youth. 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:27.110
 I think it's okay. 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:31.580
 This is more than a common membrane 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:35.180
 It's excellent and I think it's okay. 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:38.870
 More funny. I think I can make it more fun . 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:43.060
 So you can play more games 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.060
 I think I can play physiology funny . 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.349
 And keep a record of this 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.349
 I think it 's okay.
