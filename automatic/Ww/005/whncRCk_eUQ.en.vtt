 Hello everyone, pasha is a guitarist and 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.010

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.400
 There are only three of them. As you may have noticed. 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.300

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.770

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.560

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.480

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.229
 fret 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:12.530
 in major on the first fret and in A minor on 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.340
 the fifth fret is played all so intro 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.340
 how the sea is played 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:29.269
 these are the cases we put a chord d em and 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:32.140
 just play top-down strings 6 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.140
 time 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:44.650
 six times just down built 4 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:48.000
 transpose life on the chord f and play 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.000
 same thing only twice 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:54.569
 and swap the chord A.m. play 7 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.569
 time 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.530
 then a small break and begins 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.860
 buy this 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.860
 beginnings 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:19.650
 one two three 4 5 6 1 2 1 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.569
 but 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.439
 four 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.439
 me what 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:31.860
 and our own verse begins 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.860
 he plays like that 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:42.970
 that is, we beat the strings down 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.970
 this mute then up two times 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.120
 muffling again 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.370
 again 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.660
 invite to the top 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.080
 I 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:03.900
 invite and it is played at all 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:08.560
 chords and so yes and we invite 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:12.340
 invite down mute 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.870
 invite and again and m - invite 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.879
 up 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.280
 invite and once again they play 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:19.139
 together 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.979
 shia up 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:21.979
 mutes 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:37.059
 played by this verse and chorus 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:41.309
 so the transition between the refrain is true between 

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:41.309
 couplets chorus I just played 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:53.340
 blow to the country from top to bottom 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:57.610
 once on each chord 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:05:02.460
 so i'm learning and everything again 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:05.460
 the chorus begins the sky will help us 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.460

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.729
