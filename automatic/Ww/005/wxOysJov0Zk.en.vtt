have a business growing it whatever
percent<00:01:20.749> if<00:01:20.979> the<00:01:21.979> base<00:01:22.189> sales<00:01:22.579> level<00:01:23.029> is<00:01:23.209> very

percent if the base sales level is very

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.080 
percent if the base sales level is very
small<00:01:23.840> it<00:01:24.139> doesn't<00:01:24.219> matter<00:01:25.219> the<00:01:25.609> total<00:01:25.969> dollar

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
small it doesn't matter the total dollar

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.989 
small it doesn't matter the total dollar
volume<00:01:26.420> is<00:01:26.779> still<00:01:26.990> insignificant<00:01:27.579> so<00:01:28.579> I<00:01:28.609> asked

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:28.999
