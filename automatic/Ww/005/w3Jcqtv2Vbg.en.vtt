only been out since Tuesday you love it
and<00:00:24.339> there's<00:00:25.339> a<00:00:25.400> really<00:00:25.609> good<00:00:25.820> strategy<00:00:26.419> for

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
and there's a really good strategy for

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.020 
and there's a really good strategy for
care<00:00:27.410> packages

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:30.030 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.860 

yeah<00:00:30.600> and<00:00:30.900> this<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:31.530> basically<00:00:31.980> like<00:00:32.310> the

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
yeah and this is basically like the

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.940 
yeah and this is basically like the
strategies<00:00:33.870> probably<00:00:34.320> already<00:00:34.470> ruined<00:00:34.860> the

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
strategies probably already ruined the

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.890 
strategies probably already ruined the
game<00:00:35.100> but<00:00:35.550> it's<00:00:35.820> awesome<00:00:36.270> right<00:00:36.450> now<00:00:37.100> and<00:00:38.100> the

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:38.900 
game but it's awesome right now and the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.320 
game but it's awesome right now and the
strategy<00:00:39.900> is<00:00:40.580> stamping<00:00:41.580> through<00:00:41.790> many<00:00:42.120> claim

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330 
strategy is stamping through many claim

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.100 
strategy is stamping through many claim
wore<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:43.010> and<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.880> basically<00:00:45.210> just<00:00:45.480> wait<00:00:45.930> till

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
wore it and you basically just wait till

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.200 
wore it and you basically just wait till
like<00:00:46.230> search<00:00:46.440> funny<00:00:46.770> it's<00:00:47.730> kind<00:00:47.880> of<00:00:47.970> like<00:00:48.030> the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
like search funny it's kind of like the

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.380 
like search funny it's kind of like the
map<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.630> derail<00:00:48.989> or<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.670> middle<00:00:50.970> map<00:00:51.150> in

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
map and derail or that the middle map in

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.270 
map and derail or that the middle map in
the<00:00:51.480> beginning<00:00:51.630> of<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.230> game<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.710> was<00:00:52.800> like<00:00:53.010> oh

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
the beginning of the game it was like oh

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.869 
the beginning of the game it was like oh
we<00:00:54.150> go<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:55.220> end<00:00:56.220> of<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.370> middle<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.790> that

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
we go to the end of the middle and that

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.490 
we go to the end of the middle and that
was<00:00:57.030> like<00:00:57.180> where<00:00:57.510> he's<00:00:57.629> going<00:00:58.080> employ<00:00:58.290> and
