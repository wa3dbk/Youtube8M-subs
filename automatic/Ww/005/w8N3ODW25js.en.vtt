about fishing for rainbows here is
you're<00:01:08.790> not<00:01:08.970> using<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:10.080> big<00:01:10.290> bait<00:01:10.680> fish<00:01:11.010> type

waters to target big fish these fish get

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.620 
waters to target big fish these fish get
really<00:01:17.400> really<00:01:17.610> big<00:01:17.970> on<00:01:18.240> tiny<00:01:19.310> bugs<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.670> a

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
really really big on tiny bugs and a

really really big on tiny bugs and a
primarily<00:01:22.560> chironomid<00:01:23.220> in<00:01:23.820> some<00:01:24.210> waters

piranhas make up to 40% of the diet of a
big<00:01:30.270> trout<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:31.140> what<00:01:31.439> we'll<00:01:31.650> do<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.159> we'll

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
big trout and so what we'll do is we'll

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.560 
big trout and so what we'll do is we'll
target<00:01:32.850> them<00:01:32.970> with<00:01:33.950> an<00:01:34.950> indicator<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.090> then

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
target them with an indicator and then

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.859 
target them with an indicator and then

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
two flies one rig to be just off the

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.740 
two flies one rig to be just off the

bottom and the other rig to be 16 to 18
inches<00:01:43.170> up<00:01:43.439> if<00:01:44.430> there's<00:01:44.759> nothing<00:01:45.060> else<00:01:45.390> going

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
inches up if there's nothing else going

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.469 
inches up if there's nothing else going
on<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.470> can<00:01:46.680> bet<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.700> fish<00:01:48.090> are<00:01:48.360> gonna

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
on you can bet that the fish are gonna

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.139 
on you can bet that the fish are gonna
eat<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.810> chironomid<00:01:49.350> on<00:01:49.649> crane<00:01:50.340> Prairie<00:01:50.850> the

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
eat a chironomid on crane Prairie the

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.330 
eat a chironomid on crane Prairie the
trick<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.869> finding<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.409> old<00:01:52.560> river<00:01:52.829> channels

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
trick is finding the old river channels

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.370 
trick is finding the old river channels
and<00:01:53.549> as<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.149> average<00:01:54.420> lake<00:01:54.899> temperature

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
and as the average lake temperature

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.950 
and as the average lake temperature
warms<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.340> these<00:01:56.790> fish<00:01:57.119> move<00:01:57.390> into<00:01:57.689> these

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
warms the these fish move into these

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.380 
warms the these fish move into these
cooler<00:01:58.409> river<00:01:58.680> channels<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.430> use<00:02:00.090> them<00:02:00.270> as

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
cooler river channels and use them as

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.160 
cooler river channels and use them as
highways<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:01.079> move<00:02:01.259> around

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
highways to move around

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.780 
highways to move around
the<00:02:03.170> funny<00:02:03.440> thing<00:02:03.500> about<00:02:03.950> using<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.550> strike

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
the funny thing about using the strike

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.700 
the funny thing about using the strike
indicator<00:02:05.330> some<00:02:05.990> people<00:02:06.290> think<00:02:06.500> it's<00:02:06.620> a

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
indicator some people think it's a

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.529 
indicator some people think it's a
boring<00:02:06.890> way<00:02:07.190> of<00:02:07.340> finishing<00:02:07.730> I<00:02:07.910> think<00:02:08.210> it<00:02:08.360> is

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
boring way of finishing I think it is

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.719 
boring way of finishing I think it is
one<00:02:09.080> of<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:09.229> most<00:02:09.350> exciting<00:02:09.830> ways<00:02:10.039> to<00:02:10.220> fish

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.410 
something you need to set the hook on
now<00:02:23.090> because<00:02:23.720> that<00:02:24.320> fish<00:02:24.650> could<00:02:24.980> be<00:02:25.010> 10<00:02:25.970> inches

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
now because that fish could be 10 inches

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:33.310 
now because that fish could be 10 inches
long<00:02:26.450> it<00:02:27.440> might<00:02:27.740> be<00:02:27.920> 10<00:02:28.310> pounds<00:02:31.720> just<00:02:32.720> wait<00:02:33.170> on

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
long it might be 10 pounds just wait on

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:40.660 
long it might be 10 pounds just wait on
that<00:02:33.500> back<00:02:33.740> cast<00:02:37.990> perfect<00:02:39.250> so<00:02:40.250> that's<00:02:40.430> the

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
that back cast perfect so that's the

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.300 
that back cast perfect so that's the
idea<00:02:41.060> of<00:02:41.270> setting<00:02:41.750> these<00:02:42.020> things<00:02:42.080> that<00:02:42.650> about

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
idea of setting these things that about

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.660 
idea of setting these things that about
you<00:02:43.670> know<00:02:43.700> 12<00:02:44.390> inches<00:02:44.810> to<00:02:45.170> say<00:02:45.980> a<00:02:46.010> foot<00:02:46.340> to<00:02:46.489> two

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
you know 12 inches to say a foot to two

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.250 
you know 12 inches to say a foot to two
feet<00:02:46.700> off<00:02:47.120> at<00:02:47.330> the<00:02:47.390> bottom<00:02:47.600> is<00:02:47.900> where<00:02:48.050> these

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
feet off at the bottom is where these

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.690 
feet off at the bottom is where these
flies<00:02:48.560> are<00:02:48.590> sitting<00:02:49.130> and<00:02:49.250> they're<00:02:49.400> sitting

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
flies are sitting and they're sitting

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.880 
flies are sitting and they're sitting
there<00:02:49.730> down<00:02:50.120> there<00:02:50.330> doing<00:02:50.630> this<00:02:50.930> and<00:02:51.290> that's

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
there down there doing this and that's

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.940 
there down there doing this and that's
exactly<00:02:52.340> what<00:02:52.730> the<00:02:52.970> what<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.540> real<00:02:53.750> real<00:02:54.680> bug

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
exactly what the what the real real bug

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.310 
exactly what the what the real real bug
is<00:02:55.190> doing<00:02:55.580> and<00:02:55.820> they're<00:02:56.420> totally<00:02:56.630> suspended
