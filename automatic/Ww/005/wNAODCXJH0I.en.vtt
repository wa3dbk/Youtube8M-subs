00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
zip file and put them into our server

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.640 
zip file and put them into our server
folder<00:02:40.770> now<00:02:41.770> we<00:02:42.190> had<00:02:42.400> dimensional<00:02:43.000> anchor<00:02:43.330> and

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
folder now we had dimensional anchor and

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.839 
folder now we had dimensional anchor and
wireless<00:02:44.650> redstone<00:02:44.860> problems<00:02:45.489> so<00:02:45.640> we're<00:02:45.819> just

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
wireless redstone problems so we're just

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.710 
wireless redstone problems so we're just
going<00:02:46.090> to<00:02:46.150> see<00:02:46.390> if<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:48.010> if<00:02:48.849> the<00:02:48.940> fixes<00:02:49.510> are

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
going to see if the if the fixes are

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.620 
going to see if the if the fixes are
actually<00:02:50.200> okay<00:02:50.620> we're<00:02:51.280> going<00:02:51.400> to<00:02:51.459> go<00:02:51.519> ahead

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
actually okay we're going to go ahead

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.449 
actually okay we're going to go ahead
we're<00:02:52.630> going<00:02:52.750> to<00:02:52.840> launch<00:02:52.989> this<00:02:53.290> and<00:02:54.280> we're

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
we're going to launch this and we're

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:09.420 
we're going to launch this and we're
going<00:02:54.610> to<00:02:54.670> see<00:02:54.819> what<00:02:54.940> happens

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.860 

so<00:03:10.430> it<00:03:10.520> looks<00:03:10.730> like<00:03:10.790> our<00:03:10.970> server<00:03:11.270> powered<00:03:11.690> up

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
so it looks like our server powered up

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.690 
so it looks like our server powered up
fine<00:03:12.110> I<00:03:12.140> don't<00:03:12.440> see<00:03:12.620> any<00:03:12.770> major<00:03:13.070> errors<00:03:13.550> I

don't<00:03:13.940> see<00:03:14.120> any<00:03:14.950> chunk<00:03:15.950> errors<00:03:16.280> even<00:03:16.490> which<00:03:17.120> we

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
don't see any chunk errors even which we

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.020 
don't see any chunk errors even which we
had<00:03:17.450> a<00:03:17.660> problem<00:03:17.900> with<00:03:18.170> before<00:03:18.460> so<00:03:19.460> I'm<00:03:19.820> going

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
had a problem with before so I'm going

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.220 
had a problem with before so I'm going
to<00:03:20.060> go<00:03:20.150> ahead<00:03:20.180> and<00:03:20.450> log<00:03:20.630> in<00:03:20.840> and<00:03:20.990> see<00:03:21.140> how

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.170 
to go ahead and log in and see how
everything<00:03:21.620> looks<00:03:21.650> now<00:03:22.640> the<00:03:22.700> first<00:03:22.970> time<00:03:23.150> that

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180

you log in you're going to need to

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.930 
you log in you're going to need to
change<00:03:24.740> your<00:03:24.830> tekkit<00:03:25.220> lite<00:03:25.370> version<00:03:25.700> we've

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
pick a 57 or you can just use always use

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.470 
pick a 57 or you can just use always use
recommended<00:03:43.459> builds<00:03:43.790> and<00:03:43.940> that<00:03:44.120> will<00:03:44.270> pick

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
recommended builds and that will pick

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.110 
recommended builds and that will pick
all<00:03:44.720> 57<00:03:45.140> for<00:03:45.440> you<00:03:45.530> automatically<00:03:46.010> because<00:03:46.970> it

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
all 57 for you automatically because it

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.880 
all 57 for you automatically because it
is<00:03:47.239> the<00:03:47.390> current<00:03:47.660> recommended<00:03:48.170> build<00:03:48.380> so

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
is the current recommended build so

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.470 
is the current recommended build so
we'll<00:03:48.980> just<00:03:49.130> go<00:03:49.220> ahead<00:03:49.280> and<00:03:49.370> do<00:03:49.489> that<00:03:49.550> and<00:03:49.850> then

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
we'll just go ahead and do that and then

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.990
