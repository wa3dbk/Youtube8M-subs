00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.270
 Oh 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.900
 here the imagination that force that traces 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.090
 the path between someone and their dreams 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.189
 who builds walls and gives the choice 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.200
 to make a house a prison or a 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.239
 museum to then put stones 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.430
 valuable while the stones she does not 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.970
 never puts anyone anywhere wrong or 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.470
 rightly I would like to say thank you to 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.900
 children because my life begins in their 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.160
 community fertile head that slowly 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.199
 takes the form that gives him his 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.830
 gardener a child becomes his 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:51.629
 education 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.550
 but one thing that makes a big 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.920
 gardener is his ability to listen 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.309
 so this is a tribute to education 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.309
 who also knows how to listen and see that 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.869
 story need a place of characters 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.869
 welcome to school waldorf imagine 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.550
 I like human relations and I like 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.610
 music of human relations 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.610
 m 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:25.619
 for now let's see life in music 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.570
 each of the variables of our 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.000
 personality e mail a melody that we 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.250
 live or strong blow she mix 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.259
 create a harmony a cacophony of 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.310
 the importance of agreeing and for that 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.259
 know the sad we know each other at the 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.329
 speed where swirl hysteria this 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.939
 anchor this ability to regain his 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.530
 center is also primordial among others 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.329
 because we have to give the big 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.840
 musician will listen to others for 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:59.130
 to be able to play together as a teacher 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:02.729
 yves but also merapi jojo learns 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.099
 as the function in this space we 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.160
 is done but laurent to imitate our 

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:11.519
 outbursts he goes and so the training 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.640
 val-d'or also for the teacher goes 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:17.210
 to be a research work and the 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.330
 artistic development 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.790
 a child a boy a girl a child 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.860
 of 12 years a child of 6 years each 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.860
 person is very different and very 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.440
 unique and there are times when he is in 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.220
 great expansion and doubling or a 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.860
 big and too version where he discovers 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.160
 things and this artistic quality 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:44.200
 of the teacher makes that he went cost 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.200
 2 or and the child exactly 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.599
 Everything in its time 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.600
 under the sun as at school by 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.220
 example 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.780
 animals have natural charm for 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.150
 children kill minerals or 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.890
 plants in common so if we start 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.140
 to feed the curiosity on the rings 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.320
 their interest naturally grows towards 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.360
 plants from which the animal but in 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.710
 once intimate with the plans that's 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.950
 easy to interest them in minerals 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.180
 by plants in turn depend on it 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.640
 so on until you understand 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.420
 of the cosmos of atoms is back towards 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.100
 oneself always with fascination in 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.840
 giving a mission a child we him 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.240
 gives the chance to discover for himself what 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.590
 that he needs to learn two pinches 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.490
 of salt in the bread that is being prepared for 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.720
 tomorrow 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.910
 the geometry of a hut 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:49.050
 built understand the complexity of a 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:52.760
 knitting pattern of a garden things that 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:56.060
 are going to touch the missed sense in the fourth 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.040
 we are working Nordic mythology and 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.980
 then in these stories the children 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.620
 live something and there that is 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.409
 that they touched by the story when 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.230
 come and write a text and we will 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:10.099
 to account for what time women is this 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.900
 that it's plural 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:14.930
 is it singular like easy 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.729
 t cd4 giant visit they work 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.560
 this is the time of life outline 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.549
 of humanity be it history 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.310
 Greek 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:25.760
 whether it's Native Americans either 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.970
 india by accounts in poetry 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.850
 in sculpture in the es21 then the 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.940
 quietly incorporated theater 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:37.440
 what will learn to feel 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.390
 he knows 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.700
 and of course how to cultivate the person 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.510
 if we forget the body they inhabit 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.400
 the needs of intelligence 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.230
 emotional physical and psychological 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.150
 are interdependent to receptivity 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.690
 so instead of fighting against the 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.450
 need to move 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.880
 include it in learning exercise 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.560
 coordination fine motor skills the 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:07.950
 perseverance at the same time as 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:11.650
 knowledge to integrate everything under 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.880
 his name has a good rating on us in 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.510
 australia where are we putting in the 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.680
 laurentians 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:19.900
 so what is the human tendency 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.000
 here we are in a place where nature 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.980
 is rich where the four seasons are 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.940
 intense 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.760
 for me the question in the 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:30.430
 laurentians it would be like in 2000 a 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.290
 education that considered skiing as the 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:36.600
 children receive to their environment 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:36.600
 but also on the school desk 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:41.679
 we will start by walking in the 

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:45.069
 forest we saw the reliefs and learn to 

00:05:41.679 --> 00:05:45.759
 carve with clay the reliefs the 

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:47.429
 small lakes 

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:51.209
 so I told the whole story 

00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:54.309
 from the patent village of palm would have 

00:05:51.209 --> 00:05:56.979
 need 5 to 2.5 advertised as expands 

00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:59.110
 a bit because this do more research 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:01.179
 in depth who had everything really 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:08.289
 written sausages and as a block of 

00:06:01.179 --> 00:06:10.360
 France and at the same time to integrate the 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:14.379
 self-knowledge fit into the 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.669
 community but also in his day the 

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:17.559
 children of today are doomed a 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:19.479
 technology world is ubiquitous 

00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:21.129
 a world of computing becomes so 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:23.649
 intuitive that we almost do not go 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:25.449
 glad we use when a machine 

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:27.550
 that served him an endless game 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:29.619
 information and stimulation 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:32.019
 that is, cultivated the art of passion 

00:06:29.619 --> 00:06:34.089
 that a virtual universe does not come 

00:06:32.019 --> 00:06:35.529
 the most captivating place in the world or 

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:38.800
 simply a tool that adds to the 

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:41.319
 magic that already exist inhabited by a 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.610
 sincere and uncomplicated mural integrating 

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:44.199

 own freedom 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:52.320
 it sings in his freedom it's not going to say 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.860
 that the child has the freedom to close everything 

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:57.479
 the shapes and formats of the most free 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.990
 great freedom bigger my 

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:01.530
