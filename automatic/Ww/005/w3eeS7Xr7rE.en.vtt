00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.340 
otherwise it's going to look
overwhelming<00:01:58.060> so<00:01:59.060> I<00:01:59.090> like<00:01:59.450> adding<00:01:59.780> mine<00:01:59.990> so<00:02:00.260> it

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
overwhelming so I like adding mine so it

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.680 
overwhelming so I like adding mine so it
looks<00:02:00.530> really<00:02:00.800> PC<00:02:01.220> like<00:02:01.430> individual<00:02:02.180> strands

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
looks really PC like individual strands

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:14.260 
looks really PC like individual strands
of<00:02:02.810> hair<00:02:12.040> forget<00:02:13.040> it<00:02:13.160> will<00:02:13.340> be<00:02:13.459> darker<00:02:13.910> just

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
of hair forget it will be darker just

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.860 
of hair forget it will be darker just
underneath<00:02:15.070> where<00:02:16.070> her<00:02:16.250> head<00:02:16.490> sits<00:02:16.820> so<00:02:17.630> make

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
underneath where her head sits so make

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.199 
underneath where her head sits so make
sure<00:02:18.080> you've<00:02:18.290> got<00:02:18.320> a<00:02:18.470> little<00:02:18.709> bit<00:02:18.890> of<00:02:19.209> darkness

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
sure you've got a little bit of darkness

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.940 
sure you've got a little bit of darkness
there<00:02:20.690> so<00:02:21.290> just<00:02:21.560> here<00:02:23.500> because<00:02:24.500> you've<00:02:24.800> got

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
there so just here because you've got

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.430 
there so just here because you've got
the<00:02:25.040> shadow<00:02:25.280> from<00:02:25.640> her<00:02:25.910> head<00:02:26.180> now<00:02:26.959> you<00:02:27.020> can<00:02:27.290> go

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
the shadow from her head now you can go

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.479 
the shadow from her head now you can go
over<00:02:27.709> that<00:02:27.830> a<00:02:27.890> few<00:02:28.190> times<00:02:28.520> with<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:29.030> e53

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
over that a few times with the e53

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.740 
over that a few times with the e53
just<00:02:31.489> to<00:02:31.640> get<00:02:31.790> a<00:02:31.820> little<00:02:32.000> bit<00:02:32.239> of<00:02:32.330> depth<00:02:32.540> to

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
just to get a little bit of depth to

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:40.120 
just to get a little bit of depth to
that<00:02:33.020> color<00:02:37.450> see<00:02:38.450> here<00:02:38.720> how<00:02:39.020> I'm<00:02:39.200> not<00:02:39.470> coloring

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
that color see here how I'm not coloring

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.340 
that color see here how I'm not coloring
all<00:02:40.370> of<00:02:40.550> these<00:02:40.760> strands<00:02:41.120> of<00:02:41.300> hair<00:02:41.540> exactly<00:02:42.080> the

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
all of these strands of hair exactly the

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.380 
all of these strands of hair exactly the
same<00:02:42.590> this<00:02:43.400> will<00:02:43.610> add<00:02:43.730> a<00:02:43.760> little<00:02:44.030> bit<00:02:44.209> more

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
same this will add a little bit more

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.550 
same this will add a little bit more
dimension<00:02:44.570> to<00:02:45.020> your<00:02:45.260> finish<00:02:45.650> to<00:02:45.800> color

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.320 

sometimes<00:02:51.560> the<00:02:52.040> easiest<00:02:52.430> way<00:02:52.700> to<00:02:52.730> color<00:02:53.060> part

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
sometimes the easiest way to color part

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.479 
sometimes the easiest way to color part
of<00:02:53.450> an<00:02:53.570> image<00:02:53.810> is<00:02:53.989> to<00:02:54.019> turn<00:02:54.440> it<00:02:54.620> so<00:02:55.250> that<00:02:55.280> you

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
of an image is to turn it so that you

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.420 
of an image is to turn it so that you
can<00:02:55.670> actually<00:02:55.910> move<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:56.989> pen<00:02:57.260> in<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:57.920> natural
