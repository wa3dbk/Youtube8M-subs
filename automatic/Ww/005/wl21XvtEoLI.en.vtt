00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.520
 good if I want to write very well 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.619
 commenting on a new video the basics in 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.660
 this case and I bring you a maximum no 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.240
 I'm afraid for version 1.6 point 4 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.430
 I'm going to do a little review in the 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.199
 we have installed and because it gives me a 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.689
 little bit of the but I'm going to do a little bit of 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.369
 noise like the system if without it and 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.800
 then well I'm going to show you a little 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.739
 more how is the installation that a part 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.450
 for example the part of the force that is the 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:39.710
 extension of the mod the environment neither to 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.870
 install because it 's a bit complicated 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.579
 but the part of the march I leave it behind 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.379
 leave in a back with a notepad 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.239
 that afterwards explain well so that 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.039
 understand yes because the installation is a 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.570
 little harder let's talk about that from 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:52.309
 now since the launch of 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.989
 minecraft so the intellection of each 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.309
 motorcycle is more complicated and I do not want 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.239
 the video is opened so long for 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.800
 your 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.990
 good guys and we are going to lengthen a 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:06.200
 little let's go amim 17 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:07.610
 but a little on each side because it 's what 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.040
 which consists in this moment but 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.290
 It's obviously that is not the easiest 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.180
 in the recruitment of wood that is the 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.580
 getting wood makes us much more 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.160
 easy because with I think with the ax 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.200
 wood is the only one that I think does not 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.760
 has cut a tree what we do in itself 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.980
 is to cut the whole tree so that from 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.280
 down from the bottom the second block 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.590
 tree first second when cutting it in a 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.130
 go calando cutting every part of the trunk 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.320
 of the tree once everything is broken or 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.780
 be that all European wood all and 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.110
 spend European and apples for 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.110
 example 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.650
 some leaves that after having 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.450
 disappear obviously to happen that and the 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.130
 next can be done with ax 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.130
 stone when a stone 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.620
 wooden 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.220
 gold iron or diamond stone 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.130
 obviously also with the wooden one is 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.620
 what could be more complicated could be said 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.230
 so well that would be a bit of rhythm 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.450
 of the motor pause and we would move to the 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.470
 integration of this mod 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.510
 well now as nothing to say 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.580
 about the special of 200 subscribers 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.380
 I believe that 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.810
 I'm going to do some special we're going to do 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.010
 something I will see in a short time but 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.010
 well now we're going to minecraft series 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.460
 and let's see with the installation follows 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:41.100
 moving 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.100
 but good 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.400
 doing the mode between the ones I'm going to leave 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.730
 what you have to download, I'm going to 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.740
 leave everything compressed very rare thing 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.030
 and it will be easier for you and those who 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.410
 want to stay to mind are the 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.450
 complement of the mod that is a 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.280
 separate complement the mode between capi 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.560
 hector and also the one who does not have the forum 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.720
 for the nine points 6.4 I also know 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.520
 let's first let's integrate the force or 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.110
 it must not give the intervention of the mod 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.120
 because it is quite long and has its 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.170
 process and for the one who does not understand a 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.940
 little would be better to leave it written 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.010
 obviously so they understand good the 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.750
 minecraft force to enter banking 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.420
 force once we have this file 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.980
 java because they are no longer to find 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.020
 some tablets when we have the 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.970
 Men that fort 7 here we have to do 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.370
 is to double- click on it and we're going to have to 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.800
 wait for this new one to open in the mod 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.850
 system install that this that that by 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.630
 example, integration becomes easier 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:38.810
 of the microphone if there is 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.640
 and three options Well what if these 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.620
 options what we always have to 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.090
 to do is list the client and 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.680
 put the mind the majorities folder in 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.360
 this case this time the user has been 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.040
 lump imputed minecraft then already 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.390
 they know where they are going to place they did not have 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.300
 sumen case they place you and we are going to 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.600
 accept good what happens this as 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.040
 very good there finish loading the bar 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.930
 the bar 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.109
 and will follow the documentary in crÃ©n por 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.130
 firefox by version then good 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:08.600
 intersport 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:10.340
 have no problem that only once in 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.690
 three layers and how it's different in 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.280
 boats is not going to see what it says but in 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.579
 I 'm not interested in moto2 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.459
 Hold on so good 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.919
 one more thing to say before the mod 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.810
 until this is the complement of the mod 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.699
 there is also the way in which force 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.930
 universal all this what puts in a 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:30.729
 good rally I'll leave it for 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.960
 download via a half pair link 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:33.069
 I'm going to put the description of the video 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.530
 so do not worry about it going to be 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:37.509
 the mod in complement and the extension that 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.310
 it would be the for sap and the one that does not have it 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:40.810
 good the one that does not have it download 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.849
 also that will come with the grind and 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.289
 that does not have much better good as well as 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:45.639
 the guys I hope to see you in the whole video
