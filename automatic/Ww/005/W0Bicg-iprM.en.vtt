00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
there's a T flip-flop here and one of

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.800 
there's a T flip-flop here and one of
you<00:02:01.830> press<00:02:02.010> the<00:02:02.160> button<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.550> changes<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:03.300> the

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
placement of this redstone block which

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.520 
placement of this redstone block which

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
underground in a line with a delay so

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.110 
underground in a line with a delay so
that<00:02:13.920> they<00:02:14.130> open<00:02:14.700> one<00:02:15.540> by<00:02:15.570> one<00:02:15.959> also<00:02:16.260> ah<00:02:17.120> where

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
that they open one by one also ah where

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.350 
that they open one by one also ah where

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
was i where am I the current also

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.600 
was i where am I the current also
travels<00:02:24.360> up<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:26.959> these<00:02:27.959> lights<00:02:28.260> so<00:02:28.610> after

textured<00:03:02.430> all<00:03:02.549> these<00:03:02.760> vases<00:03:04.280> they<00:03:05.280> they're

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
textured all these vases they they're

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.390 
textured all these vases they they're
all<00:03:05.610> based<00:03:05.910> on<00:03:06.060> reference<00:03:06.530> from<00:03:07.530> a<00:03:07.830> vase<00:03:08.160> in

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
all based on reference from a vase in

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.350 
all based on reference from a vase in
the<00:03:08.459> movie<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:09.320> they<00:03:10.320> they<00:03:11.250> are<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:12.060> actual

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
the movie and they they are the actual

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.979 
the movie and they they are the actual
block<00:03:12.810> that<00:03:13.019> it<00:03:13.140> is<00:03:13.230> is<00:03:13.440> a<00:03:13.850> different<00:03:14.850> ores<00:03:15.060> so

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
block that it is is a different ores so

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.160 
block that it is is a different ores so
yeah<00:03:16.170> she<00:03:16.920> gets<00:03:17.489> pulled<00:03:17.790> through<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.630> these

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
yeah she gets pulled through the these

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.640 
yeah she gets pulled through the these
hallways<00:03:19.500> and<00:03:20.000> oh<00:03:21.000> yeah<00:03:21.750> there's<00:03:22.230> a<00:03:22.260> button<00:03:22.500> to

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
hallways and oh yeah there's a button to

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.930 
hallways and oh yeah there's a button to
close<00:03:22.799> the<00:03:22.950> doors<00:03:23.130> behind<00:03:23.220> you<00:03:24.080> yeah<00:03:25.080> and<00:03:25.940> she

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
close the doors behind you yeah and she

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.400 
close the doors behind you yeah and she
gets<00:03:27.090> pulled<00:03:27.269> through<00:03:27.299> these<00:03:27.540> hallways<00:03:27.750> and<00:03:28.170> I

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
gets pulled through these hallways and I

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.310 
gets pulled through these hallways and I
think<00:03:28.799> that<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.820> layout<00:03:30.030> again<00:03:30.480> is<00:03:30.690> incorrect

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
think that the layout again is incorrect

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.800 
think that the layout again is incorrect
but<00:03:31.560> you<00:03:31.860> can't<00:03:32.130> you<00:03:32.459> won't<00:03:32.580> really<00:03:32.790> tell<00:03:33.360> okay

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
but you can't you won't really tell okay

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.449 
but you can't you won't really tell okay
so<00:03:34.620> there's<00:03:34.799> a<00:03:34.890> scene<00:03:35.100> in<00:03:35.130> the<00:03:35.190> movie<00:03:35.430> where

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
so there's a scene in the movie where

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:36.590 
so there's a scene in the movie where
she<00:03:35.610> gets<00:03:35.790> pulled<00:03:35.940> through<00:03:36.060> this<00:03:36.269> hallway

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
she gets pulled through this hallway

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.210 
she gets pulled through this hallway
which<00:03:36.959> i<00:03:37.080> think<00:03:37.140> is<00:03:37.380> really<00:03:37.620> nice<00:03:37.830> looking

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
which i think is really nice looking

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.760 
which i think is really nice looking
there's<00:03:39.090> little<00:03:39.299> corridors<00:03:39.780> with<00:03:40.530> with<00:03:41.010> a

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
there's little corridors with with a

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.130 
there's little corridors with with a
bases<00:03:42.610> in<00:03:42.730> them<00:03:42.850> and<00:03:43.030> it<00:03:43.240> took<00:03:43.810> me<00:03:43.900> a<00:03:43.960> while<00:03:44.080> to

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
bases in them and it took me a while to

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.920 
bases in them and it took me a while to
figure<00:03:44.320> out<00:03:44.470> that<00:03:44.710> redstone<00:03:45.690> torches<00:03:46.690> are

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
figure out that redstone torches are

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.530 
figure out that redstone torches are
work<00:03:47.320> much<00:03:47.590> better<00:03:47.620> for<00:03:48.100> dim<00:03:48.430> lighting<00:03:48.700> than

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
work much better for dim lighting than

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.200 
work much better for dim lighting than
regular<00:03:49.720> torches<00:03:50.320> okay<00:03:50.920> so<00:03:51.340> here's<00:03:51.670> the<00:03:51.820> part

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 
regular torches okay so here's the part

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.710 
regular torches okay so here's the part
where<00:03:52.330> she<00:03:53.050> gets<00:03:53.740> flung<00:03:54.580> into<00:03:54.880> you<00:03:55.300> Baba's
