it's a pretty decent board i got mine
from<00:00:25.230> hundreds<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.650> 10<00:00:25.859> years<00:00:26.099> um<00:00:26.519> I<00:00:27.439> really

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
from hundreds of 10 years um I really

from hundreds of 10 years um I really
like<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.279> original<00:00:29.670> decades<00:00:30.150> 22

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
like it I of the original decades 22

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.269 
like it I of the original decades 22
inches<00:00:30.869> long<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.470> think<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.800> weighs<00:00:31.920> two<00:00:32.250> pounds

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
inches long I think it weighs two pounds

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.889 
inches long I think it weighs two pounds
or<00:00:32.850> so<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.440> have<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:35.120> just<00:00:36.120> regular<00:00:36.480> trunk

it's<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.890> nice<00:00:53.070> port<00:00:53.460> it's<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:54.120> have<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.300> bit<00:00:54.539> of

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
it's a nice port it's you have a bit of

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.840 
it's a nice port it's you have a bit of
a<00:00:54.719> kick<00:00:54.870> tail<00:00:55.110> on<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.440> it's<00:00:56.070> not<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.370> best<00:00:56.550> for

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
a kick tail on it it's not the best for

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.180 
a kick tail on it it's not the best for
doing<00:00:57.090> tricks<00:00:57.360> but<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:58.620> know<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.800> can<00:00:59.039> do<00:00:59.160> all

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
doing tricks but you know you can do all

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.959 
doing tricks but you know you can do all
these<00:00:59.550> on<00:00:59.730> um<00:01:00.710> the<00:01:01.710> wheels<00:01:02.039> are<00:01:02.399> kind<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.730> set

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
these on um the wheels are kind of set

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.020 
these on um the wheels are kind of set
so<00:01:03.449> if<00:01:04.280> you<00:01:05.280> don't<00:01:05.430> like<00:01:05.580> kind<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.850> stock

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
so if you don't like kind of stock

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.969 
so if you don't like kind of stock
wheels<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.869> probably<00:01:07.229> turn<00:01:07.680> them<00:01:07.860> out

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
wheels and you probably turn them out

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.620 
wheels and you probably turn them out
for<00:01:08.250> may<00:01:08.369> be<00:01:09.140> really<00:01:10.140> small<00:01:10.380> wheels<00:01:10.740> maybe<00:01:11.220> I

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
for may be really small wheels maybe I

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.440 
for may be really small wheels maybe I
put<00:01:12.630> skateboard<00:01:13.229> wheels<00:01:13.439> on<00:01:13.680> your<00:01:13.710> ones<00:01:14.100> and

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
put skateboard wheels on your ones and

know what are you gonna do I'm the the
deck<00:02:29.250> one<00:02:29.760> more<00:02:29.940> thing<00:02:30.090> about<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.330> deck<00:02:30.540> is<00:02:30.840> it

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
deck one more thing about the deck is it

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.930 
deck one more thing about the deck is it
does<00:02:31.799> get<00:02:31.980> dirty<00:02:32.280> so<00:02:32.430> I<00:02:32.640> would<00:02:32.910> recommend

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
does get dirty so I would recommend

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.300 
does get dirty so I would recommend
getting<00:02:33.420> a<00:02:33.660> darker<00:02:34.080> color<00:02:34.350> I<00:02:34.650> like<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.220> yellow

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
getting a darker color I like the yellow

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.020 
getting a darker color I like the yellow
but<00:02:35.640> purple<00:02:36.480> is<00:02:36.570> really<00:02:36.870> nice<00:02:37.019> too<00:02:37.350> um<00:02:37.590> I<00:02:38.130> think

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
but purple is really nice too um I think

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.410 
but purple is really nice too um I think
this<00:02:39.390> board<00:02:39.660> is<00:02:39.720> great<00:02:40.110> for<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.530> money<00:02:40.709> if

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420
