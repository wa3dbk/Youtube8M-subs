hey<00:00:00.750> guys<00:00:00.989> it's<00:00:01.410> anime<00:00:01.890> guruma<00:00:02.280> guru<00:00:02.820> ma<00:00:03.060> and

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
hey guys it's anime guruma guru ma and

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.460 
hey guys it's anime guruma guru ma and
today<00:00:04.110> I'm<00:00:04.980> going<00:00:05.339> to<00:00:05.490> do<00:00:05.940> a<00:00:06.240> comparison<00:00:06.960> of

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
today I'm going to do a comparison of

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.110 
today I'm going to do a comparison of
Sigma<00:00:08.460> Yui<00:00:08.730> and<00:00:09.800> move<00:00:10.800> up<00:00:10.950> Yui<00:00:11.250> otherwise

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
Sigma Yui and move up Yui otherwise

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.779 
Sigma Yui and move up Yui otherwise
known<00:00:12.450> as<00:00:13.820> Sigma<00:00:14.820> u<00:00:15.000> e<00:00:15.410> versus<00:00:16.410> mode<00:00:16.740> mode<00:00:17.279> view

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
known as Sigma u e versus mode mode view

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:26.349 
known as Sigma u e versus mode mode view
e<00:00:19.039> so<00:00:20.039> let's<00:00:20.550> start<00:00:21.320> with<00:00:23.060> the<00:00:24.230> faces<00:00:25.230> of<00:00:25.260> the

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:26.359 
e so let's start with the faces of the

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:34.840 
e so let's start with the faces of the
of<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.830> characters<00:00:30.769> one<00:00:31.769> second

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:49.850 

look<00:00:35.850> be<00:00:36.059> tastin<00:00:45.829> so<00:00:48.170> now<00:00:49.170> let's<00:00:49.440> prepare<00:00:49.710> the

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
look be tastin so now let's prepare the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.560 
look be tastin so now let's prepare the
faces<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:52.670> got<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.180> we<00:00:54.329> here

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
faces I got this you we here

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.490 
faces I got this you we here
doesn't<00:00:57.570> she<00:00:57.809> look<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.500> lot<00:00:59.570> more<00:01:00.570> dynamic<00:01:01.260> than

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
doesn't she look a lot more dynamic than

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:10.380 
doesn't she look a lot more dynamic than
the<00:01:02.359> this<00:01:03.359> face<00:01:03.660> here

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.070 

and<00:01:11.590> there<00:01:12.590> is<00:01:12.770> a<00:01:13.070> lot<00:01:13.400> more<00:01:13.430> detail<00:01:14.300> put<00:01:15.020> into

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
and there is a lot more detail put into

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:23.850 
and there is a lot more detail put into
the<00:01:15.860> hair<00:01:17.290> then<00:01:18.290> the<00:01:18.860> mobit<00:01:19.370> and<00:01:21.010> the<00:01:22.010> hair<00:01:22.310> is

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
the hair then the mobit and the hair is

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.590 
the hair then the mobit and the hair is
straight<00:01:24.860> down<00:01:24.890> as<00:01:25.490> if<00:01:26.000> it<00:01:26.780> is<00:01:27.350> static<00:01:28.600> the

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
straight down as if it is static the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.910 
straight down as if it is static the
Sigma<00:01:30.110> is<00:01:30.440> the<00:01:30.890> hairs<00:01:32.350> moving<00:01:33.350> like<00:01:33.530> as<00:01:33.740> if

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
Sigma is the hairs moving like as if

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.010 
Sigma is the hairs moving like as if
there's<00:01:34.160> air<00:01:34.400> going<00:01:35.090> on<00:01:35.300> because<00:01:35.510> air<00:01:35.990> is

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
there's air going on because air is

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.440 
there's air going on because air is
pushing<00:01:36.590> it<00:01:36.860> away<00:01:37.370> so<00:01:38.200> there<00:01:39.200> is<00:01:40.450> movement

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
pushing it away so there is movement

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.870 
pushing it away so there is movement
that's<00:01:41.810> going<00:01:42.110> on<00:01:42.229> in<00:01:42.410> the<00:01:43.100> Sigma<00:01:43.780> character

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
that's going on in the Sigma character

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.750 
that's going on in the Sigma character
but<00:01:47.290> the<00:01:48.290> mole<00:01:48.560> bit<00:01:48.740> as<00:01:48.950> you<00:01:49.130> can<00:01:49.280> see<00:01:49.490> it's

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
but the mole bit as you can see it's

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.030 
but the mole bit as you can see it's
kind<00:01:50.030> of<00:01:50.120> static<00:01:50.630> already<00:01:51.050> you<00:01:51.260> can<00:01:51.440> see<00:01:51.710> and

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
kind of static already you can see and

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.190 
kind of static already you can see and
what's<00:01:52.880> kind<00:01:53.210> of<00:01:53.300> odd<00:01:53.540> is<00:01:53.990> that<00:01:55.479> you<00:01:56.479> compared

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
what's kind of odd is that you compared

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.109 
what's kind of odd is that you compared
the<00:01:57.729> skin<00:01:58.729> with<00:01:58.970> the<00:01:59.150> Sigma<00:02:00.010> the<00:02:01.010> skin<00:02:01.490> of<00:02:01.760> the

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
the skin with the Sigma the skin of the

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.520 
the skin with the Sigma the skin of the
mobile<00:02:03.080> of<00:02:03.470> the<00:02:03.800> mobile<00:02:04.190> figure<00:02:04.760> is<00:02:05.229> kind<00:02:06.229> of

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
mobile of the mobile figure is kind of

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.510 
mobile of the mobile figure is kind of
yellowish<00:02:07.130> I<00:02:07.610> don't<00:02:08.390> know<00:02:08.479> why<00:02:08.780> they<00:02:09.050> put<00:02:09.290> a

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
yellowish I don't know why they put a

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.550 
yellowish I don't know why they put a
yellowish<00:02:10.520> skin<00:02:10.990> you<00:02:11.990> will<00:02:12.140> never<00:02:12.320> really

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
yellowish skin you will never really

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:20.710 
yellowish skin you will never really
know<00:02:12.709> why<00:02:14.200> also<00:02:16.900> you<00:02:17.900> might<00:02:18.140> see<00:02:18.680> but<00:02:19.720> these

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
know why also you might see but these

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.160 
know why also you might see but these
mobile<00:02:21.440> pet<00:02:21.680> is<00:02:21.920> bigger<00:02:22.310> than<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:23.180> Sigma<00:02:23.570> head

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.140 

now<00:02:27.170> let's<00:02:27.560> compare<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:29.180> body<00:02:30.140> so<00:02:31.100> let's<00:02:31.580> take

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
now let's compare the body so let's take

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:42.520 
now let's compare the body so let's take
off<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:33.350> guitar<00:02:38.560> must<00:02:39.560> be<00:02:39.709> figma<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:41.540> guitar

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
off the guitar must be figma the guitar

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.250 
off the guitar must be figma the guitar
is<00:02:43.090> there's<00:02:44.090> a<00:02:44.150> little<00:02:44.450> peg<00:02:44.810> in<00:02:44.959> there<00:02:45.110> you

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
is there's a little peg in there you

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.770 
is there's a little peg in there you
have<00:02:45.470> to<00:02:45.650> attach<00:02:46.040> by<00:02:46.910> yourself<00:02:47.410> be<00:02:48.880> um<00:02:49.880> the

strap so take off you can take off the
head<00:02:54.410> of<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.980> Sigma

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.869 

and<00:03:09.080> you<00:03:09.140> put<00:03:09.290> it<00:03:09.319> back<00:03:09.439> in<00:03:11.379> now<00:03:12.760> could<00:03:13.760> be

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
is lighter the color is lighter than be

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:45.820 
is lighter the color is lighter than be
one<00:04:37.450> with<00:04:38.450> the<00:04:38.750> moment<00:04:41.650> yeah<00:04:42.650> and<00:04:44.350> if<00:04:45.350> we<00:04:45.680> go

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
one with the moment yeah and if we go

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:51.850 
one with the moment yeah and if we go
down<00:04:46.220> we<00:04:47.560> can<00:04:48.560> see<00:04:49.100> that<00:04:50.090> there<00:04:50.900> are<00:04:50.930> little

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
down we can see that there are little

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.550 
down we can see that there are little
folds<00:04:52.610> in<00:04:52.760> the<00:04:53.510> clothes<00:04:54.050> of<00:04:54.500> the<00:04:54.950> figma

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
folds in the clothes of the figma

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:04.390 
folds in the clothes of the figma
compared<00:04:57.560> with<00:04:57.680> this<00:05:00.160> as<00:05:01.300> you<00:05:02.300> can<00:05:02.660> see<00:05:03.400> in

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
compared with this as you can see in

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:13.500 
compared with this as you can see in
this<00:05:05.390> part<00:05:06.190> it<00:05:07.190> is<00:05:08.150> a<00:05:08.330> bitch<00:05:08.630> uhm<00:05:11.169> shorter<00:05:12.169> and

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
this part it is a bitch uhm shorter and

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:18.770 
this part it is a bitch uhm shorter and
there<00:05:14.510> are<00:05:14.720> a<00:05:14.780> lot<00:05:15.020> of<00:05:15.320> folds

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.520 

spin<00:05:19.380> by<00:05:19.530> soft<00:05:19.860> PVC<00:05:20.130> here<00:05:21.000> also<00:05:21.260> but<00:05:22.260> there<00:05:22.470> are

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
spin by soft PVC here also but there are

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:29.320 
spin by soft PVC here also but there are
folds<00:05:22.889> and<00:05:23.010> it<00:05:23.220> makes<00:05:23.520> it<00:05:23.850> look<00:05:24.780> a<00:05:24.990> lot<00:05:25.820> like<00:05:26.820> it

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.440 

makes<00:05:30.330> it<00:05:30.540> this<00:05:31.380> Sigma<00:05:32.280> meat<00:05:32.820> of<00:05:33.060> the<00:05:33.419> thing

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
makes it this Sigma meat of the thing

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.920 
makes it this Sigma meat of the thing
that<00:05:33.810> UE<00:05:34.080> it<00:05:34.950> looks<00:05:35.430> a<00:05:35.580> lot<00:05:35.820> more<00:05:36.270> alive<00:05:36.540> than

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
that UE it looks a lot more alive than

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:43.520 
that UE it looks a lot more alive than
the<00:05:37.190> mo<00:05:38.190> of<00:05:38.220> UE<00:05:40.580> there<00:05:41.580> are<00:05:41.760> some<00:05:42.230> folds<00:05:43.230> on<00:05:43.380> the

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
the mo of UE there are some folds on the

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:49.430 
the mo of UE there are some folds on the
arms<00:05:44.360> as<00:05:45.360> you<00:05:45.540> can<00:05:45.690> see<00:05:47.900> holds<00:05:48.900> in<00:05:48.990> the<00:05:49.080> arms

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
arms as you can see holds in the arms

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:56.810 
arms as you can see holds in the arms
and<00:05:51.290> let's<00:05:52.290> compare<00:05:52.440> the<00:05:52.680> arms<00:05:54.590> there<00:05:55.590> is<00:05:55.890> a<00:05:56.280> as

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
and let's compare the arms there is a as

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.890 
and let's compare the arms there is a as
much<00:05:57.780> folds<00:05:58.380> as<00:05:58.560> fimo<00:05:59.340> bit<00:05:59.520> and<00:05:59.760> as<00:06:00.630> you<00:06:00.660> can

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
much folds as fimo bit and as you can

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:07.040 
much folds as fimo bit and as you can
see<00:06:00.960> the<00:06:01.640> school<00:06:02.640> blazer<00:06:05.000> school<00:06:06.000> blazer<00:06:06.240> here

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
see the school blazer school blazer here

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.610 
see the school blazer school blazer here
is<00:06:07.260> a<00:06:08.300> bit<00:06:09.300> of<00:06:09.450> a<00:06:09.570> different<00:06:09.930> color<00:06:10.200> than<00:06:10.470> the

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
is a bit of a different color than the

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.159 
is a bit of a different color than the
one<00:06:10.740> here<00:06:11.100> this<00:06:11.400> is<00:06:11.460> a<00:06:11.610> bit<00:06:11.880> doc<00:06:12.180> darker<00:06:12.900> than

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:13.169 
one here this is a bit doc darker than

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:22.790 
one here this is a bit doc darker than
the<00:06:13.500> Sigma<00:06:13.979> 1<00:06:14.130> and<00:06:17.030> yeah<00:06:18.030> and<00:06:19.160> see<00:06:20.160> there<00:06:20.400> is<00:06:21.800> or

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
the Sigma 1 and yeah and see there is or

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.570 
the Sigma 1 and yeah and see there is or
some<00:06:23.190> little<00:06:24.229> joints<00:06:25.229> here<00:06:25.710> and<00:06:26.370> if<00:06:26.520> you

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 
some little joints here and if you

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.020 
some little joints here and if you
compare<00:06:26.880> here<00:06:27.390> I<00:06:28.040> kind<00:06:29.040> of<00:06:29.130> prefer<00:06:29.430> these

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.030 
compare here I kind of prefer these

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:37.340 
compare here I kind of prefer these
joints<00:06:30.860> because<00:06:31.860> we<00:06:32.190> are<00:06:32.460> glass<00:06:32.940> visible

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:37.350 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:46.310 

as<00:06:37.980> you<00:06:38.250> can<00:06:38.370> see<00:06:41.570> now<00:06:44.720> the<00:06:45.720> dead<00:06:46.020> now<00:06:46.260> the

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:46.320 
as you can see now the dead now the

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:55.430 
as you can see now the dead now the
joints<00:06:47.250> for<00:06:48.030> the<00:06:48.240> Sigma<00:06:48.810> is<00:06:49.820> is<00:06:50.820> a<00:06:51.860> more<00:06:54.440> it's

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 
joints for the Sigma is is a more it's

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:00.410 
joints for the Sigma is is a more it's
more<00:06:55.860> difficult<00:06:56.490> to<00:06:56.880> twist<00:06:58.040> um<00:06:59.040> like<00:07:00.030> an<00:07:00.150> arm

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:00.420 
more difficult to twist um like an arm

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.380 
more difficult to twist um like an arm
or<00:07:00.660> something

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:02.390 
or something

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:05.210 
or something
Michigan<00:07:03.390> para<00:07:03.600> feet<00:07:03.840> movin<00:07:04.110> because<00:07:04.770> I'm<00:07:04.980> not

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:05.220 
Michigan para feet movin because I'm not

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:10.280 
Michigan para feet movin because I'm not
sure<00:07:05.490> if<00:07:05.730> it's<00:07:06.540> because<00:07:07.080> I<00:07:08.030> um<00:07:09.030> I<00:07:09.120> opened<00:07:09.810> the

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:10.290 
sure if it's because I um I opened the

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:11.630 
sure if it's because I um I opened the
my<00:07:10.710> you<00:07:10.920> later

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:11.640 
my you later

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:20.480 
my you later
but<00:07:13.730> yeah<00:07:15.290> so<00:07:16.290> the<00:07:17.480> joints<00:07:18.480> it's<00:07:18.780> a<00:07:19.740> lot<00:07:20.010> easier

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:20.490 
but yeah so the joints it's a lot easier

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:25.190 
but yeah so the joints it's a lot easier
for<00:07:20.550> the<00:07:20.880> mobile<00:07:21.780> PUA<00:07:23.360> it's<00:07:24.360> a<00:07:24.390> lot<00:07:24.540> easier<00:07:24.780> to

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:25.200 
for the mobile PUA it's a lot easier to

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.770 
for the mobile PUA it's a lot easier to
turn<00:07:25.410> twist<00:07:26.010> then<00:07:26.580> the<00:07:26.850> figma<00:07:27.210> you<00:07:27.360> eat<00:07:27.540> and

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:27.780 
turn twist then the figma you eat and

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.580 
turn twist then the figma you eat and
the<00:07:28.560> school<00:07:28.860> dress<00:07:29.840> as<00:07:30.840> you<00:07:30.990> can<00:07:31.110> see<00:07:31.320> there

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:31.590 
the school dress as you can see there

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:36.130 
the school dress as you can see there
are<00:07:32.270> um<00:07:33.290> there's<00:07:34.290> movement<00:07:34.590> inside<00:07:35.370> and

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:36.140 
are um there's movement inside and

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:40.880 
are um there's movement inside and
there's<00:07:37.140> a<00:07:37.260> bit<00:07:37.590> of<00:07:37.740> movement<00:07:39.560> don't<00:07:40.560> compare

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:40.890 
there's a bit of movement don't compare

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:43.990 
there's a bit of movement don't compare
the<00:07:41.010> legs<00:07:41.250> legs<00:07:41.820> are<00:07:42.000> kind<00:07:42.180> of<00:07:42.300> the<00:07:42.510> same<00:07:42.870> and
