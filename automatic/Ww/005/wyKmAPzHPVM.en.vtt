very effectively but I did want to show
you<00:00:21.330> today<00:00:21.859> kind<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.970> process<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:25.109> how<00:00:25.320> it

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
you today kind of the process and how it

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.470 
you today kind of the process and how it
works<00:00:25.680> so<00:00:25.890> first<00:00:26.550> thing<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:26.970> can<00:00:27.119> do<00:00:27.269> is

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
works so first thing that you can do is

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.870 
works so first thing that you can do is
just<00:00:27.660> fill<00:00:27.840> your<00:00:28.099> figure<00:00:29.099> mouth<00:00:29.310> up<00:00:29.519> with<00:00:29.670> air

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
just fill your figure mouth up with air

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:38.810 
just fill your figure mouth up with air
like<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.230> just<00:00:32.160> blow<00:00:32.399> out<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.910> air<00:00:37.820> like

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
like that and just blow out the air like

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.690 
like that and just blow out the air like
that<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.469> the<00:00:40.469> next<00:00:40.739> thing<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.370> want<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.610> to

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
that and the next thing is I want you to

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.549 
that and the next thing is I want you to
try<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:41.940> again<00:00:42.030> but<00:00:42.629> see<00:00:42.899> if<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.110> can<00:00:43.260> breathe

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
try it again but see if you can breathe

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.950 
try it again but see if you can breathe
in<00:00:43.860> through<00:00:44.100> your<00:00:44.219> nose<00:00:44.399> at<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.149> same<00:00:45.450> time<00:00:45.750> as

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
in through your nose at the same time as

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.930 
in through your nose at the same time as
you're<00:00:46.110> forcing<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:47.129> air<00:00:47.280> out<00:00:47.579> with<00:00:47.789> your

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
you're forcing the air out with your

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:55.270 
you're forcing the air out with your
cheek<00:00:48.180> so

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.770 

and<00:00:56.350> the<00:00:57.350> idea<00:00:57.710> is<00:00:57.920> that<00:00:57.950> you<00:00:58.310> can<00:00:58.460> some<00:00:59.150> you

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
and the idea is that you can some you

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.840 
and the idea is that you can some you
know<00:00:59.900> try<00:01:00.290> to<00:01:00.320> get<00:01:00.560> that<00:01:00.739> Airstream<00:01:01.430> to<00:01:01.670> move

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
know try to get that Airstream to move

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.030 
know try to get that Airstream to move
continually<00:01:02.690> I'll<00:01:03.440> see<00:01:03.650> if<00:01:03.739> I<00:01:03.800> can

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
continually I'll see if I can

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.370 
continually I'll see if I can
demonstrate<00:01:04.220> it<00:01:04.760> for<00:01:05.570> you<00:01:05.690> on<00:01:05.810> saxophones

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
demonstrate it for you on saxophones

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.710 
demonstrate it for you on saxophones
though<00:01:06.740> you<00:01:07.190> know<00:01:07.310> I'm<00:01:07.460> not<00:01:07.610> that<00:01:08.120> great<00:01:08.240> at<00:01:08.390> it

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
though you know I'm not that great at it

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.500 
though you know I'm not that great at it
actually<00:01:09.610> though<00:01:10.610> at<00:01:10.760> least<00:01:10.820> you<00:01:11.090> can<00:01:11.210> kind<00:01:11.450> of

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
actually though at least you can kind of

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:23.560 
actually though at least you can kind of
get<00:01:11.660> an<00:01:11.750> idea

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.120 

and<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.689> can<00:01:24.869> kind<00:01:25.079> of<00:01:25.140> hear<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.320> air<00:01:25.590> now<00:01:26.070> you

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
know interrupt it a little bit in there

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.260
