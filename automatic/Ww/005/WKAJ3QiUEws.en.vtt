00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.410 

every<00:00:06.390> two<00:00:06.600> three<00:00:06.629> months<00:00:07.049> my<00:00:07.970> parents<00:00:08.970> boiler

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
every two three months my parents boiler

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.080 
every two three months my parents boiler
cuts<00:00:09.840> off<00:00:10.050> because<00:00:10.500> of<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.800> loss<00:00:10.980> of<00:00:11.090> water

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
cuts off because of the loss of water

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.990 
cuts off because of the loss of water
pressure<00:00:12.710> and<00:00:13.710> as<00:00:13.920> you<00:00:14.040> can<00:00:14.160> see<00:00:14.219> on<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.759> dial

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
pressure and as you can see on the dial

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.890 
pressure and as you can see on the dial
here<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:16.230> pressure<00:00:16.500> is<00:00:16.800> very<00:00:17.130> very<00:00:17.699> low

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
here the pressure is very very low

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.109 
here the pressure is very very low
-<00:00:19.289> what<00:00:19.439> properly<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.189> pressure<00:00:20.460> indicator

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
- what properly the pressure indicator

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:29.029 
- what properly the pressure indicator
should<00:00:21.510> be<00:00:21.660> at<00:00:21.750> one<00:00:22.080> point<00:00:22.470> zero<00:00:22.650> bar<00:00:27.830> so<00:00:28.830> that

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
should be at one point zero bar so that

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.470 
should be at one point zero bar so that
would<00:00:29.189> be<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.429> normal<00:00:29.640> state<00:00:30.090> for<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.779> boiler

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
would be the normal state for the boiler

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.510 
would be the normal state for the boiler
so<00:00:33.480> as<00:00:33.780> he<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.200> variable<00:00:36.260> so<00:00:37.260> what<00:00:38.129> happens

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
so as he is variable so what happens

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.660 
so as he is variable so what happens
when<00:00:38.760> now<00:00:38.910> happens<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.379> boiler<00:00:40.739> can

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
when now happens is that the boiler can

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.060 
when now happens is that the boiler can
cut<00:00:41.940> out<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:43.070> the<00:00:44.070> red<00:00:44.399> pocket<00:00:45.829> indicator<00:00:46.829> you

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
cut out and the red pocket indicator you

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.549 
cut out and the red pocket indicator you
can<00:00:47.100> see<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:48.170> illuminated<00:00:50.629> so<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:52.230> affects

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
can see is illuminated so it affects

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.910 
can see is illuminated so it affects
that<00:00:52.770> we<00:00:53.550> have<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.879> raise<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.390> pressure<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.500> us

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
that we have to raise the pressure to us

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.840 
that we have to raise the pressure to us
one<00:00:56.160> point<00:00:56.430> zero<00:00:56.850> level<00:00:58.370> first<00:00:59.370> thing<00:00:59.579> we<00:00:59.670> do

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
one point zero level first thing we do

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.340 
one point zero level first thing we do
is<00:01:00.770> to<00:01:01.770> remove<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.219> cover<00:01:02.460> from<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.300> front

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
is to remove the cover from the front

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.210 
is to remove the cover from the front
beneath<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.830> boiler<00:01:05.250> that<00:01:06.770> has<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.950> be<00:01:08.040> taken

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
beneath the boiler that has to be taken

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.840 
beneath the boiler that has to be taken
away

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
away

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.950 
away
I<00:01:08.880> mean<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.450> way<00:01:09.570> Tello<00:01:10.439> access<00:01:11.810> till<00:01:12.810> we<00:01:12.930> can

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
I mean the way Tello access till we can

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.710 
I mean the way Tello access till we can
side<00:01:13.350> we<00:01:13.590> have<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.549> pipework<00:01:15.030> beneath<00:01:15.540> the

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
side we have the pipework beneath the

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.499 
side we have the pipework beneath the
boiler<00:01:18.439> and<00:01:19.439> on<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.740> right<00:01:19.890> hand<00:01:20.070> side<00:01:20.509> you

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
boiler and on the right hand side you

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.080 
boiler and on the right hand side you
can<00:01:21.540> see<00:01:21.890> the<00:01:22.890> valve<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.520> we're<00:01:23.670> gonna<00:01:23.790> have

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
can see the valve that we're gonna have

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.620 
can see the valve that we're gonna have
to<00:01:24.360> get<00:01:25.229> involved<00:01:25.740> with<00:01:26.150> that's<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.450> valve

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
to get involved with that's the valve

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.060 
to get involved with that's the valve
there<00:01:29.299> so<00:01:30.299> what<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.600> have<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.810> do<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.290> start

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
there so what you have to do to start

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.420 
there so what you have to do to start
the<00:01:32.130> pressure<00:01:32.780> increasing<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:35.040> turn<00:01:35.250> the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
the pressure increasing is to turn the

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.010 
the pressure increasing is to turn the
valve<00:01:36.110> to<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.140> left<00:01:37.439> or<00:01:37.680> anti-clockwise<00:01:38.220> and

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
valve to the left or anti-clockwise and

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.880 
valve to the left or anti-clockwise and
manat<00:01:40.020> happens<00:01:40.409> you'll<00:01:40.590> hear<00:01:40.860> this<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:42.890> water

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
manat happens you'll hear this of water

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.859 
manat happens you'll hear this of water
starting<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.670> flow<00:01:46.009> this<00:01:47.009> water<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.869> passing

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
starting to flow this water is passing

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.740 
starting to flow this water is passing
through<00:01:49.259> there<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.860> that's<00:01:50.490> what<00:01:51.329> causes<00:01:51.600> the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
through there and that's what causes the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.550 
through there and that's what causes the
pressure<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.799> rise<00:01:53.960> and<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.110> can<00:01:55.259> see<00:01:55.409> the

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
pressure to rise and you can see the

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.800 
pressure to rise and you can see the
dial<00:01:55.799> there<00:01:56.040> itself<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:57.180> pressure<00:01:57.479> neither

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
dial there itself the pressure neither

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.459 
dial there itself the pressure neither
is<00:01:58.530> tough<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.130> raise<00:01:59.600> well<00:02:00.600> quite<00:02:00.930> slowly<00:02:01.290> at

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
is tough to raise well quite slowly at

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.980 
is tough to raise well quite slowly at
the<00:02:01.560> woman<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:01.920> us<00:02:02.070> because<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.700> call<00:02:03.630> me<00:02:03.750> Tom

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
the woman and us because I call me Tom

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.410 
the woman and us because I call me Tom
that<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.439> valve<00:02:05.000> partially<00:02:07.729> so<00:02:08.729> what<00:02:09.330> we'll

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
that the valve partially so what we'll

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.410 
that the valve partially so what we'll
do<00:02:09.539> now<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:09.899> I'll<00:02:10.110> make<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.190> dial<00:02:11.459> make<00:02:12.300> the

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
do now is I'll make the dial make the

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.740 
do now is I'll make the dial make the
pleasure<00:02:12.599> go

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
pleasure go

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.480 
pleasure go
by<00:02:14.380> increasing<00:02:14.740> the<00:02:15.040> valve<00:02:15.790> flow<00:02:17.400> turning<00:02:18.400> it

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
by increasing the valve flow turning it

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.870 
by increasing the valve flow turning it
to<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.700> left<00:02:22.770> and<00:02:23.770> very<00:02:24.010> quickly<00:02:24.310> as<00:02:24.580> you<00:02:24.730> can

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
to the left and very quickly as you can

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.350 
to the left and very quickly as you can
see<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:26.320> needle<00:02:26.470> has<00:02:26.740> arrived<00:02:27.040> at<00:02:27.190> a<00:02:27.280> 1.0<00:02:28.090> bar

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
see the needle has arrived at a 1.0 bar

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.040 
see the needle has arrived at a 1.0 bar
mark<00:02:28.690> and<00:02:29.680> that's<00:02:29.920> normal<00:02:30.340> pressure<00:02:31.050> so

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
mark and that's normal pressure so

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.580 
mark and that's normal pressure so
pressure<00:02:32.580> curve<00:02:33.580> turned<00:02:33.880> off<00:02:34.060> again<00:02:34.380> has<00:02:35.380> the

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
pressure curve turned off again has the

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.680 
pressure curve turned off again has the
job<00:02:35.740> done<00:02:38.370> as<00:02:39.370> I<00:02:39.490> say<00:02:39.670> this<00:02:39.850> is<00:02:40.030> only<00:02:40.209> done

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
job done as I say this is only done

every 2 or 3 months and that's in my
case<00:02:45.600> that's<00:02:46.600> the<00:02:46.750> end<00:02:46.930> of<00:02:46.990> a<00:02:47.080> story<00:02:47.350> so<00:02:47.650> thanks

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
case that's the end of a story so thanks

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:55.840 
case that's the end of a story so thanks
for<00:02:48.250> watching
