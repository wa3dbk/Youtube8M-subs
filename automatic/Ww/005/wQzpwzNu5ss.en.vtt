00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.719
 this song was one of the first 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.510
 we went up to our channel more or less by 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:16.090
 the year 2009 what we are going to do now 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:19.060
 is to give a detailed explanation how 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:22.150
 you can solve this strumming that seems 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.520
 difficult but in reality it is not 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.250
 to begin let's do in each one 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.259
 of the chords a strumming number two if 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.559
 remember the strumming number two is 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:34.100
 simple thumb down another thumb 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.760
 down 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:41.770
 cancel half index down 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.280
 thumb down and index up 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.280
 Y 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.760
 and 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.190
 this trait then has given us a lot in 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.739
 previous songs so I give for 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.430
 sitting that you already dominate moderately 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.200
 this strum you make a compass of the receipt 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.620
 number two in each chord and you're going to 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.620
 stay like this 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.030
 yes 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.940
 what we are going to do now is separate in 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.310
 couples these four chords the sun with 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.549
 the king 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.909
 and the younger will be the new couple 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.969
 york 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:28.649
 then in G major let's make a 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:28.649
 compass number two normal 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.140
 and in a network we are going to make a compass number 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.149
 but let's add an index for 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.409
 up then immediately after 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:43.390
 of the first thumb 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:46.000
 let's remember back the number two is with a 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.179
 index after sticking the thumb is left 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.179
 A) Yes 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.100
 and with this edition our progression goes 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.100
 to sound like this 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.010
 Y 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.010
 again 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.780
 i 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.980
 in the agreed major sol we are going to make a 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.620
 compass of residue number 2 without 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:24.390
 variations and in the next chord 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.550
 let's eliminate the first thumb and in 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.980
 bcs thumb we're going to put you off 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.250
 with this part of the hand and it will stay 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.250
 A) Yes 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.569
 Now let's do it a little bit more 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:39.569
 slow for you to realize 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.010
 i 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.290
 and you see that he's already taking a little 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.860
 form the strum but we have not yet 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.650
 come to the final strum now if 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.740
 in the first chord of the couples we go 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.680
 to eliminate the second thumb or maybe 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:10.170
 make it very short so that it is almost 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.180
 imperceptible and in the second pair of 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.450
 chords in I mean the chord of re and 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.340
 aldo in the last two touches that are 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.170
 thumb and index we are also going to 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.870
 lower the volume a little and equal 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.720
 form the penultimate thumb of the chord of 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.520
 We're just going to mitigate a bit the 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.660
 touch the volume of the touch and you will 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.660
 stay this way 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.600
 Y 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.250
 but there is still a small detail missing 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.290
 to brighten this strum 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.900
 when we are in the agreement of D major 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.330
 and touch us in the descent to cancel half 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.720
 index below we play the chord but 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:55.570
 without stepping on the first string and then 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:59.790
 touching martÃ­ we call with the finger that 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.790
 step on the first rope with strength 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.950
 We do the same in the agreement of C major 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.090
 ah 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.550
 and now saws I think it's totally 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.740
 ready what we are going to do now is 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.420
 play the part of the guitar as a 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.730
 track so you can see where else 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:22.109
 the changes or you can also use it as 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.109
 a karaoke track 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.590
 and 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:52.670
 to 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.380
 all right 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:57.380
 i 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.380
 ah 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.160
 Y 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.160
 i 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.990
 Y 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.050
 Y 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.620
 Y 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.620
 i 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.050
 and 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.360
 or not 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.870
 Y 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.380
 and 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.380
 i 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.440
 yes 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.250
 Y
