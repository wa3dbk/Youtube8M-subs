00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.300
 hello everybody , welcome, one more course 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.310
 site www.lutzconcursos.com.br teach them 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.710
 advanced measurement on all components 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.599
 of the motherboard using only one 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.140
 multimeter this course it comes to 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.100
 complete a course 04 that my course 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.290
 motherboard 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.149
 however several buyers asked 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.780
 again that I would take this course 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.910
 with a more advanced measurement 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.770
 especially in the aspect of the chipset 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.739
 finally the memory processor and 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.079
 always pulling the internal sources 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.719
 so I produce this specific course 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.399
 where the text all components and 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.370
 identifies the components 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.250
 The initial concepts also present the 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.559
 pwm circuitry of the board so that 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.460
 You can fix the sources. 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.990
 internal 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.970
 I also explain what it is like 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.060
 works like testing with the motherboard 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.119
 off and the motherboard is connected to the 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.610
 components which already form part of the 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.250
 video entry on rifles every day 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.670
 by gold crystal resistor the transit 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.909
 and the capacitor to coil a chewing gum and the 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.860
 also personal chipset because many 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.530
 notebook technicians always end up 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.170
 condemning the chipset mainly in 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.540
 problem of kissing without realizing 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.400
 very technical tests required 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.140
 condemning noted in the video I will play a 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.280
 external monitor did not give video then 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.530
 ends up condemning and with that is the end 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.659
 damaging the chipset many times 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.640
 because it was working and you 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.130
 throw a necessary heat on him at last 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.689
 there is a very interesting test you 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.369
 can do with their own multimeter as well 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.829
 simple to really identify whether 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.770
 is or is not presenting the problem 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.079
 I also teach this test in the course 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.850
 as well as how to test the battery of three 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.149
 points 3 volts finally the external battery 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.739
 of note is to test the processor already 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.150
 the internal source as well as the 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.350
 internal memory source that in the case 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.730
 would be the circuit pw 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.200
 anyone to know if you are 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.460
 reaching the right voltage in memory 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.420
 is reaching the right voltage of the 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.400
 processor 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.950
 I teach you how to test the power button. 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.460
 because it gives a lot of trouble with the 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.740
 power is then and also the tensions 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.480
 of the board which are 19 volts 5 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.510
 volt and 3 volts 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.540
 if you can identify the voltages in the 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.180
 accurately and always using 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.580
 you already with certain 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.040
 more than half of short-term problems 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.070
 Why do not you what you want? 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.080
 solving the problem of 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.960
 internal sources ie solve the 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.490
 problems of the pwm circuits it controls 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.730
 these tensions 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.960
 You already solve all the board problem. 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.430
 So, there's a course, too. 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.430
 I hope you like it.
