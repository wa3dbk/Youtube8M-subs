that when we were there was just when

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.080 
that when we were there was just when
the<00:00:33.899> library<00:00:34.230> was<00:00:34.500> first<00:00:34.890> set<00:00:35.070> up<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.430> helping

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
the library was first set up and helping

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.520 
the library was first set up and helping
occasionally<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.719> library<00:00:37.079> teacher<00:00:37.260> to

the school the school was divided in

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.020 
the school the school was divided in
that<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.899> came<00:00:43.140> into<00:00:43.290> into<00:00:43.800> blocks<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.460> of

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
that that came into into blocks and of

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.569 
that that came into into blocks and of
course<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.660> we<00:00:46.410> had<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.680> move<00:00:46.920> from<00:00:47.219> block<00:00:47.550> to

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
course that we had to move from block to

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.180 
course that we had to move from block to
block<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:48.210> go<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.420> classes<00:00:48.950> and<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.070> was

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
block to go to classes and this was

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.900 
block to go to classes and this was
always<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.430> good<00:00:50.610> excuse<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:52.340> to<00:00:53.340> delay<00:00:53.670> the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
always a good excuse to and to delay the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.979 
always a good excuse to and to delay the
time<00:00:54.120> moving<00:00:54.510> between<00:00:54.750> these<00:00:55.199> blocks<00:00:55.760> the

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
time moving between these blocks the

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:58.910 
time moving between these blocks the
what<00:00:57.989> I'm<00:00:58.170> trying<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.440> think<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.710> other<00:00:58.770> things

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
what I'm trying to think of other things

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.220 
what I'm trying to think of other things
that<00:00:59.219> temp<00:00:59.609> perhaps<00:01:00.300> one<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.570> them<00:01:00.719> another

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
that temp perhaps one of them another

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.689 
that temp perhaps one of them another
memories<00:01:01.710> are<00:01:01.829> however<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.219> school<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.670> that

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
memories are however the school is that

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.600 
memories are however the school is that

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
thing I can think of that probably

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.060 
thing I can think of that probably
wasn't<00:01:09.479> news<00:01:09.810> i<00:01:09.930> remember<00:01:10.380> being<00:01:10.619> at<00:01:10.770> there<00:01:10.950> in

the metalwork class and the the files

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.240 
the metalwork class and the the files
were<00:01:15.689> useless<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.290> could<00:01:16.439> fail<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.979> fails

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
were useless you could fail the fails

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.310 
were useless you could fail the fails
were<00:01:17.430> absolutely<00:01:18.330> hopeless<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.689> can<00:01:18.840> rub<00:01:19.110> and

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
were absolutely hopeless you can rub and

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.590 
were absolutely hopeless you can rub and
rub<00:01:19.380> away<00:01:19.680> at<00:01:19.950> pieces<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.430> metal<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.820> nothing

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
rub away at pieces of metal and nothing

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.420 
rub away at pieces of metal and nothing
ever<00:01:21.720> seemed<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.140> happen<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.920> turned<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.340> to

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
ever seemed to happen and I turned it to

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.550 
ever seemed to happen and I turned it to
be<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.580> plumber<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.180> know<00:01:24.270> how<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.810> use<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.200> file

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
be a plumber so I know how to use a file

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.609 
be a plumber so I know how to use a file
the<00:01:26.490> they<00:01:27.330> also<00:01:27.509> also<00:01:27.990> remember<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.350> bait

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
the they also also remember the bait

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.530 
the they also also remember the bait
sheds<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.220> probably<00:01:29.700> enough<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.180> the

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
sheds and probably enough so that the

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.600 
sheds and probably enough so that the
that<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.200> probably<00:01:31.740> shouldn't<00:01:32.159> see<00:01:32.280> any<00:01:32.310> water

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
that I probably shouldn't see any water

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.179 
that I probably shouldn't see any water
but<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.180> bait<00:01:33.360> shades<00:01:33.659> because<00:01:33.930> that's<00:01:34.920> fear

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
but the bait shades because that's fear

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.859 
but the bait shades because that's fear
that's<00:01:35.640> where<00:01:35.850> we<00:01:35.939> used<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.180> go<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.450> have<00:01:36.689> the

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
that's where we used to go to have the

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.859 
that's where we used to go to have the

odd the odds cigarette one of the things

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.990 
odd the odds cigarette one of the things
that<00:01:39.990> can<00:01:40.110> remember<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.740> when<00:01:41.549> when<00:01:41.909> I

things that they that the slatest damina

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.780 
things that they that the slatest damina
we<00:03:30.900> would<00:03:31.260> end<00:03:31.440> up<00:03:31.560> getting<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:31.950> belt<00:03:32.160> and<00:03:32.400> of

we would end up getting the belt and of

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.210 
we would end up getting the belt and of
course<00:03:32.850> the<00:03:33.480> thing<00:03:33.720> was<00:03:33.900> is<00:03:33.960> that<00:03:34.170> as<00:03:34.770> you<00:03:34.830> can

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220

least<00:03:37.110> the<00:03:37.620> idea<00:03:37.980> was<00:03:38.130> when<00:03:38.340> you<00:03:38.460> did<00:03:38.640> have<00:03:38.940> to

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
least the idea was when you did have to

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.480 
least the idea was when you did have to
take<00:03:39.240> the<00:03:39.360> belt<00:03:39.570> was<00:03:39.780> not<00:03:40.050> to<00:03:40.230> flinch<00:03:40.530> not<00:03:41.310> too

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
take the belt was not to flinch not too

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.400 
take the belt was not to flinch not too
short<00:03:41.670> ear<00:03:42.090> and<00:03:42.420> that<00:03:42.840> was<00:03:42.990> quite<00:03:43.200> difficult

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
short ear and that was quite difficult

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
short ear and that was quite difficult
at<00:03:43.830> times<00:03:44.010> as<00:03:44.190> i<00:03:44.280> remember<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:45.600> and<00:03:46.230> of<00:03:47.220> course
