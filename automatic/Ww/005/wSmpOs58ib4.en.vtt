the<00:01:28.979> aluminum<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.640> popping<00:01:30.540> them<00:01:30.630> out<00:01:30.750> not

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
the aluminum and popping them out not

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.899

might take the tube tape up the ends of

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.890 
might take the tube tape up the ends of

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
it and stick that in there so then so

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.469 
it and stick that in there so then so
that<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.260> can<00:01:52.380> just<00:01:52.560> pop<00:01:53.130> tape<00:01:53.549> off<00:01:53.760> and<00:01:53.790> put

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
that you can just pop tape off and put

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.820 
that you can just pop tape off and put
it<00:01:54.570> right<00:01:54.600> on<00:01:54.900> the<00:01:55.020> lathe<00:01:55.200> at<00:01:55.409> would<00:01:55.500> probably

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
it right on the lathe at would probably

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.050 
it right on the lathe at would probably
work<00:01:55.950> well<00:01:56.250> okay<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.439> the<00:01:58.439> lay<00:01:59.040> or<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.640> camera

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
work well okay and the lay or the camera

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.370 
work well okay and the lay or the camera
cranes<00:02:00.330> I<00:02:02.299> altogether<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.600> have<00:02:03.810> two<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.260> them

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
they are identical to the one I showed

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.100 
they are identical to the one I showed
you<00:02:06.450> in<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.659> video<00:02:06.900> and<00:02:07.939> it's<00:02:08.939> probably<00:02:09.420> under

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
you in the video and it's probably under

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.500 
you in the video and it's probably under
20<00:02:10.470> bucks<00:02:10.709> for<00:02:11.039> both<00:02:11.370> of<00:02:11.640> them<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.939> casters

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
20 bucks for both of them the casters

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.259 
20 bucks for both of them the casters
were<00:02:12.720> I<00:02:13.370> don't<00:02:14.370> know<00:02:14.430> probably<00:02:14.939> three<00:02:15.150> or<00:02:15.180> four

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
were I don't know probably three or four

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:16.339 
were I don't know probably three or four
bucks<00:02:15.629> a<00:02:15.810> piece

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
bucks a piece

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:17.270 
bucks a piece
and<00:02:16.439> then<00:02:16.650> the

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
and then the

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.540 
and then the
the<00:02:17.960> dowel<00:02:18.960> I<00:02:19.260> think<00:02:19.500> I<00:02:19.650> think<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.070> dowels<00:02:20.280> are

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
the dowel I think I think the dowels are

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.600 
the dowel I think I think the dowels are
$10<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:21.660> one<00:02:22.350> dowel<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.860> care<00:02:23.070> of<00:02:23.190> more<00:02:23.430> than

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
$10 and one dowel to care of more than

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.220 
$10 and one dowel to care of more than
both<00:02:23.790> of<00:02:23.820> it<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.270> then<00:02:24.570> it<00:02:24.660> was<00:02:24.780> just<00:02:24.810> scrap

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
both of it and then it was just scrap

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.000 
both of it and then it was just scrap
scrap<00:02:25.770> piece<00:02:26.160> of<00:02:26.190> plywood<00:02:27.170> so<00:02:28.170> yeah<00:02:28.830> I<00:02:28.860> think

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
scrap piece of plywood so yeah I think

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.710 
scrap piece of plywood so yeah I think
both<00:02:29.340> of<00:02:29.460> them<00:02:29.580> together<00:02:29.670> it's<00:02:30.030> under<00:02:30.300> under

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
both of them together it's under under

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.949 
both of them together it's under under
20<00:02:31.350> bucks<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:31.890> somebody<00:02:32.610> asked<00:02:32.730> me<00:02:32.959> that

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
20 bucks and somebody asked me that
