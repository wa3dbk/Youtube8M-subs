00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.620
 Hello 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.480
 It is a heart version vintage machine 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.920
 This time is it 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:27.230
 It is June 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.770
 Toward that Philadelphia 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.880
 I'm going to go instrumental type 5 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:37.129
 That product is 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.150
 Some adjustment has been completed, so I would like to introduce you a little bit and the science department is thinking 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:40.120
 I will 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.079
 It is a casino 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.600
 A little 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:48.720
 The form that you imagine is the form 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:53.960
 I'm going to pick up this one that is slightly different 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.960
 It becomes one of the 66th graders 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.400
 Well it is royal tongue color That 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.860
 Hey's diluted Strike 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.920
 Has retired quite a bit 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.650
 Already 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:12.340
 Of lemon drop like a feeling which is said by softening flow less in Paul Gibson 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:16.719
 It becomes a color, and a wind instrument 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:19.490
 It's rather cool, it's pretty cool Well, of course the weather check is also 

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:21.190
 Entered evenly 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.230
 It is Wandi cup Well 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:28.780
 It is good to be characteristic of this instrument after all 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:30.390
 Different from the to pick up position 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.820
 Because it is attached 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.470
 Naturally the sound coming out will be totally different 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.810
 A little at the mart 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:43.490
 I think if you can hear the sound 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.490
 Tema ah 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:53.780
 The tailpiece is a biblolan, but 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:58.280
 A little bit out of stock for that farm for this 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:04.750
 But I'm I am using now stop state 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.750
 Of course, if you use an alternative arm, you can use that leaf art as well 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.159
 Let's is also the home page of the leg 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.000
 66 years why 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.819
 That nut width 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.730
 It is said that a narrow version of good pitch 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.080
 Those of 40 a little less than 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.840
 is not it 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.840
 Has become is a little thin and easy to hold shape 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:35.400
 Well, I think it's a slim head 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.150
 A little to the thick 60s ago saying that pad head 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.590
 It becomes 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:44.500
 Already familiar with Epiphone 5 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.500
 It is here if I say the head is 3 6 heads 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.720
 I also adjusted that red too 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.230
 Very 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.180
 I think it is easy to use 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:02.200
 It Is You There 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:04.410
 The pick guard is decided a little more for the leaguer 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.930
 Remove and use 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:11.269
 Is it a type? 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.269

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.700
 Yeah It is reasonable also beautiful videos 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:24.020
 Check the feathers and 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.320

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.850
 It is left 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.550
 It is in good condition 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:50.810
 Let's just ask what kind of sound this 1 pickup will increase 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.620
 Ha ha ha 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:57.010
