especially<00:01:34.619> in<00:01:34.710> salads<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.280> think<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:35.670> you

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
especially in salads I think that you

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.450 
especially in salads I think that you
could<00:01:35.909> put<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.270> on<00:01:36.420> top<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.659> soups<00:01:37.140> or<00:01:37.530> you

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
could put it on top of soups or you

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.649 
could put it on top of soups or you
could<00:01:38.640> just<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:39.180> don't<00:01:39.600> know<00:01:39.720> eat<00:01:40.229> it

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
could just I don't know eat it

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.450 
could just I don't know eat it
so<00:01:42.659> once<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.110> olive<00:01:43.380> oil<00:01:43.470> starts<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.009> heat<00:01:44.430> up

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
so once the olive oil starts to heat up

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.889 
so once the olive oil starts to heat up
just<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.880> little<00:01:45.119> bit<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.390> don't<00:01:45.509> want<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.780> to

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
just a little bit you don't want it to

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.840 
just a little bit you don't want it to
get<00:01:46.020> too<00:01:46.290> hot<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:47.040> just<00:01:47.070> want<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.340> start<00:01:47.610> out

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
get too hot you just want to start out

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.270 
get too hot you just want to start out
warm<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.869> then<00:01:49.140> put<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:49.979> in<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.130> prosciutto

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
warm and then put it in the prosciutto

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.600 
warm and then put it in the prosciutto
and<00:01:50.880> start<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.899> let<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.200> get<00:01:52.409> slowly<00:01:53.040> crisp<00:01:53.430> up

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
and start to let it get slowly crisp up

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.850 
and start to let it get slowly crisp up
