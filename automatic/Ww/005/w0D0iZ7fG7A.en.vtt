00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.060
What is the soul? Is it physical?
Does it ever die? Is it immaterial?

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.169
If it’s immortal in ethereal form
I’m curious, where did it exist before we

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:26.759
were born?
Where does it reside? Is it inside our head?

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.640
In our entire body? Is it limited within our
chest?

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.440
Does the soul change?
If a child dies young, does the soul persist

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.870
to grow to its adult state?
And if you’re challenged mentally or physically

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.809
Upon your death do you acquire insight or
ability?

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.120
And what about the twins arising from a single
egg

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.640
When the cell divides does the soul comply
and split two ways?

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.809
Into half or whole?
Do conjoined twins get to have their own?

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.840
What’s an actual soul?
I’ve yet to be given a definition that’s

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.980
consistent
Plus not in contradiction with the laws of Physics (1)

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:06.240
It's soul food for thought that I got Bout the afterlife party the afterlife party

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.260
It's soul food for thought if you want Bout the afterlife party the afterlife party

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:18.160
It’s soul food for thought, that I got
‘Bout the afterlife party, the afterlife party

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:24.000
It's soul food for thought if you want Bout the afterlife party the afterlife part

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.780
If the soul happens at the moment of conception
Then, it is a process and can be detected

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.149
But if it can’t as would some say
I wonder how they knew the soul existed in

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.280
the first place
Could they be more wrong?

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.380
The soul as a non-substantial substance is
an oxymoron (2)

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.049
By what mechanism does a soul detect an image?
If it doesn’t have a retina I suspect it’s

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.989
lacking vision
How can it retain our personality after we

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:53.942
die?
When we know our neurons cease to survive (3)

00:01:53.942 --> 00:01:56.240
Perhaps you know someone who’s had a stroke

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.869
with tragic loss
You’re saying they regain the faculties

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.949
lost after they’re gone? (4)
I think you better check again

00:02:02.949 --> 00:02:06.880
Extraordinary claims demand extraordinary
evidence (5)

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.040
And about the truth,
Assertions without grounds can be dismissed without proof

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.120
It’s soul food for thought, that I got
‘Bout the afterlife party, the afterlife

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.140
It's soul food for thought if you want Bout the afterlife party the afterlife party

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.060
It’s soul food for thought, that I got
‘Bout the afterlife party, the afterlife

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.100
It's soul food for thought if you want Bout the afterlife party the afterlife party
