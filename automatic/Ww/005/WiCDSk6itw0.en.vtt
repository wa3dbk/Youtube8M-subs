00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.620
 Hello everyone 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.950
 changes in his habits in any 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.560
 case with this new model e 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.270
 what is a guitar that slice a 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.240
 little bit with with the habits and in 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.190
 terms of marketing and in terms of 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.170
 manufacturing and then equipment here 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.010
 we look at the quality martin but we're going 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.930
 on something else 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:37.770
 so here the model is gpcg a4 between 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.559
 as it is at 4 p to 4 t 4 thank you 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.140
 thank you that frêche chantôme 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.220
 So here is a guitar here is a real 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.900
 that to the reference are well that one is 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.370
 not at all in the usual habits 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:54.330
 fabulous usual habit of martin 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:56.460
 so we notice there the black binding the 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.610
 plate also a little bit original in 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.400
 tortoise finish and then the preamp 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:06.119
 here we do not feel we are 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:09.270
 at martin with his the heel the 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.160
 cutting there is quite new we saw 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.610
 a little that two months on the 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.290
 series 16 but here it is clearly 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.350
 a habit that is taken at martine 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:23.280
 slightly domed back also mechanical 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.740
 oil bath that by cons we know the 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.660
 martin logo always so elegant and 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.289
 then my faith a quality of manufacture 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:35.459
 ccc martin what diary has nothing to say 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:38.100
 Here the varnish is just beautiful the 

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:39.929
 countries clis are very very fine the 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.039
 similar cash reinforcements are refined 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:46.860
 and then the dam is there and ax classics 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:49.590
 at this level no surprise at the level 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.430
 of dark obviously plugged this is the 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.880
 classic with the 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.830
 the new file f1 that does not bring 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.690
 really big thing in terms of his 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.020
 ergonomics, however, it is rather 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.490
 very very nice here with switches 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.470
 for the hour face to trigger 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.330
 the tuner and the tuner is hyper 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.060
 readable it goes out it's one of 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.110
 best integrated tuner and what 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.250
 does that make it all three 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.100
 little buttons it's something 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.340
 pretty looking strap fastener 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:21.940
 series here and then there obviously where we 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:27.120
 find the jack output and then the pine 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:30.489
 which is very accessible 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.550
 that's a little box like that 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:35.200
 and it's quite successful too because it 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:40.060
 has become well integrated in the designates 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:42.780
 overall of the guitar go we did a 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.780
 a little purr 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.770
 1 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.909
 here you have it in you have heard it 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.370
 it's really the guitar made for 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:19.939
 accompany this and it's also a 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.970
 guitar that goes this very well get out 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:26.430
 a solo attempt here on stage 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.739
 or even studio bearings this is a 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.900
 instrument that is very balanced which 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.239
 has a sinn setting just 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.319
 spotless and there is nothing to say about 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.810
 once we say yes we will retouch a 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.730
 little bit right or left there it's 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.370
 both high enough so we can 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.139
 beating is low enough not to 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.670
 to toil when you need to go 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.049
 fast enough 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.209
 and then and then lesson well here it is 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:51.510
 there he fails he is present he is 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.829
 defined and then then that's it's the 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.310
 definition is it comes mostly from 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:58.500
 spruce at level 2 at the level of 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.450
 table since the macif obviously all 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.099
 what is cashew for for the body there 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.989
 this is what is this heat for 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:06.030
 the sleeve we also get a lot 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.760
 a lot of serious the form that allows 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.319
 to compensate for the cutaway that does not 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.629
 lose a lot but still a little 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.919
 little 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:15.209
 so at the design level this is 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:17.070
 just a no-fault 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.539
 if you are looking for a seine guitar and 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.039
 that you find that martine may 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.959
 did a little bit in who little too 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:24.300
 ristic 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:26.039
 well there you are good to go back to 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.250
 store and then try this one too 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:31.860
 because that's it I think it's 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.180
 just history to silence those who 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.380
 those who were bad tongues and 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.630
 who thinks it's Martin 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.680
 guitar a cushy guitar and the 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.970
 martin guitars as were saying our 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.699
 grandfathers a martin j -p his is 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.289
 powerful of air well here it is 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:45.409
 martine now I think it's 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:45.409
 clear
