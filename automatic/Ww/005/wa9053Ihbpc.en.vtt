00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
quarters here lean down stand up stick

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.260 
quarters here lean down stand up stick
behind<00:01:07.549> push<00:01:08.549> around<00:01:10.159> give<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.310> going<00:01:11.790> when<00:01:12.150> it

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
behind push around give it going when it

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.179 
behind push around give it going when it
gets<00:01:12.420> like<00:01:12.570> there<00:01:12.840> see<00:01:13.170> if<00:01:13.229> we<00:01:13.320> can<00:01:13.439> touch<00:01:14.010> on

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
gets like there see if we can touch on

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.510 
gets like there see if we can touch on
this<00:01:14.310> hind<00:01:14.610> quarters<00:01:15.530> turn<00:01:16.530> in<00:01:16.710> face<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:16.979> now

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
we take this here and let's take that

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.130 
we take this here and let's take that
same<00:03:50.000> concept<00:03:50.209> but<00:03:50.570> let's<00:03:50.750> put<00:03:50.870> it<00:03:50.959> on<00:03:51.049> the

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
same concept but let's put it on the

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.580 
same concept but let's put it on the
move<00:03:51.519> let's<00:03:52.519> disengage<00:03:52.910> bring<00:03:53.840> the<00:03:53.989> stick
