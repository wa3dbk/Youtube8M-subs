all that concrete and salt to keep the

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:09.190 
all that concrete and salt to keep the
roots<00:06:08.000> out<00:06:08.240> because<00:06:08.480> apparently<00:06:08.870> there<00:06:09.080> were

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:09.200

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:19.639 
roots in that concrete really well how

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:24.250 
roots in that concrete really well how
do<00:06:19.700> we<00:06:19.820> know<00:06:19.970> this<00:06:20.120> sewer<00:06:20.360> even<00:06:20.690> works<00:06:20.930> I<00:06:23.260> mean

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:24.260 
do we know this sewer even works I mean

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.310 
do we know this sewer even works I mean
from<00:06:24.590> here<00:06:24.950> from<00:06:25.490> here<00:06:25.760> to<00:06:25.820> later<00:06:26.120> I<00:06:26.419> guess

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:27.320 
from here from here to later I guess

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:32.560 
from here from here to later I guess
we'll<00:06:27.500> find<00:06:27.710> out<00:06:30.100> huh<00:06:31.100> well<00:06:31.640> at<00:06:31.850> least<00:06:32.030> he'll

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:32.570 
we'll find out huh well at least he'll

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.800 
we'll find out huh well at least he'll
have<00:06:32.600> a<00:06:33.040> about<00:06:34.040> a<00:06:34.070> quarter<00:06:34.400> mile<00:06:34.810> four-inch
