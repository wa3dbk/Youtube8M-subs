00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.390
 hello to everyone i am and the liber 

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:09.290
 commented to all of you now I'm going to 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:13.040
 teach how to reach the lightsaber 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:15.259
 black as you see is entering the 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.930
 lightsaber options we have it 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:19.939
 here blocked ok we have no way to 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.430
 find it in principle but I'm going 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:25.490
 to say where it is is exactly in 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.869
 my pc is right before you face 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.700
 darth vader at the end that I'm actually going to 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.160
 upload it now too 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.360
 what you have to do is first create 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.100
 and ride this 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.200
 this gravitational elevator that is 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.610
 inside the options menu of the menu 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.530
 objectives we are going to have to send toco 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.720
 force and up but we also have 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.720
 charges you have to charge 267 and 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.430
 we cross waters and good what you have to 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.180
 to do is to climb all the way up 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:55.790
 totally ignoring the level of 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:59.030
 I hope this does not kill me 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:01.220
 several at the top we have to 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.510
 even jumping what would this be 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.720
 goal that would be now we have to 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.330
 they are wondering who has been and 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.920
 good and we have to climb up 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.700
 as i said 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.920
 OK 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.840
 I did not expect that, we already have it 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.259
 I have to search up here where 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.329
 is this and surprise is up here 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.979
 I do not deny that it is safe 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:25.320
 we have to make more than one attempt as 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.090
 I'm doing it now but good here 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.210
 I'm going to try to do it well another 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.130
 time 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.130
 that is shooting me is that I do not know 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.060
 I had already taken care 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.880
 you have to keep an eye here 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.420
 not not so sure not 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.970

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.780

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.780

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.020
 sniper that is taking away so much 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.020
 lifetime 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:10.500
 here is good for a little while 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.930
 because it's going to touch your nose you go to 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.209
 die in the star uy 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.420

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.420
 good 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.710
 here there are many 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.660

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:30.740

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.760
