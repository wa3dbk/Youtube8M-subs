00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 hi how are my name jose techno 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.549
 fanatic dotcom and good here them 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.529
 I bring some rumors about what 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.330
 which is the new pro macbook that 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.380
 It would be showing up very soon so 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.380
 let's go with the video 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.099
 or let's go with the rumors and 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.720
 let's start with respect to the rumors that 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:28.369
 there was earlier this year that 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.199
 they talked about that the new macbook pro 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.119
 would come much thinner than follows 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:35.329
 resemble something in making the macbook 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.860
 current air current rumors let's say 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.239
 a week ago from very sources 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.550
 reliable they talk about that the new 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.409
 macbook pro would come much thinner 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.860
 but keeping the same design of the 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:46.510
 current macbook pro 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.460
 another the rumors are sent to that the 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.020
 new macbook would come with what 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.970
 they come to be retina screen display 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.200
 but it's a very interesting point because 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.150
 there has been a lot of controversy with 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.630
 regarding this topic and the reason is very 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.300
 simple 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.310
 one of the strengths or the price of what 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.220
 which currently costs the screen 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.080
 current of the macbook pro and also 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.640
 they presented the cost of the price of what 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.010
 that is born to retina display is with a 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.660
 screen and 15.4 inches we are 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.000
 talking about that on the current screen 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.170
 it has a cost of 68 dollars versus 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.960
 which is the retina screen 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.790
 160 dollar display then the 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.560
 question was that I was going to assume that cost 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.630
 if it's going to be the end user today is going to 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.430
 be japan then that's where it was created 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.100
 the controversy regarding whether 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.990
 apple would present this year its new 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.210
 macbook pro with what it comes to be 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.520
 Retina display or just keep the 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.960
 screen that currently has another of 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.940
 the rumors talk about the 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.830
 processor of the new macro which 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.890
 would use what comes to be the intel 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.509
 aviv a lot has been talked about with regard to 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.509
 this processor because of the fact that 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.850
 many companies are waiting for them 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.950
 your order arrives and that's why 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.920
 Many companies are also delaying 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.570
 of your computers because of the great 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.820
 demand that this processor had 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.740
 intel is therefore also that which apple 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.110
 has also delayed the presentation of 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.719
 your product and the macbook pro the imac 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.630
 by the fact that the processors 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:10.000
 they have had so much demand that they do not 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.709
 have delivered on time originating from that 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.450
 all the companies that provide 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.980
 computers as they are delayed also in 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.540

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.549
