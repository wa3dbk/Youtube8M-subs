00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.659
 hi girls how are i am expensive 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.659
 Saracho and this is life is not pink 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.330
 if we see each other in specific cases and we 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.770
 we start thinking because we ended up with 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.660
 our previous partners surely 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.220
 we will have a very good explanation for 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.250
 each of them but there always comes a 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.890
 moment a breaking point in which 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.720
 we fall in love, that is, in some 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.750
 moment the feelings start to 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.489
 change and then down in a dive 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.050
 maybe for us it is much more 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:30.880
 simple to explain why we 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.590
 we fall in love with some person I do not know if the 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.940
 word of that love exists but I 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.440
 I'm going to invent it for this capsule ok 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.300
 I do not know if women for us is 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.310
 easier to explain why we stopped 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.870
 love someone but men such 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.720
 have a very different idea about 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.110
 Why do you stop loving your partner? 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.110
 accompany 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.970
 it's for religion and for those of san 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.920
 Martin in six states what the PSOE 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.190
 Kings 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.250
 these birds stops 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.430
 they are medium that are not attentive and do not 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.080
 answer the calls as well as you 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.740
 they think a bit that they do not care 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.399
 I think it's part of strategy but 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.880
 like he loses the charm when 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:16.880
 meeting 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.090
 in my case as 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.740
 the way they think things and are 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.740
 how silly 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.470
 Well, if you pass the emotion because 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.630
 physical because he's rich for a while 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.880
 but if there is not something else you can 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.960
 practice with what you can converse or 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.270
 you can 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.450
 and enjoy it 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.490
 there is no more just sex and there are already many 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.859
 factors that lead a couple to 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.450
 end their relationship many of them are 

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:52.340
 generally related to the fact that 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.280
 feelings change so that the couple 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.049
 it ended a huge process around 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.030
 and obviously there are two people 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.469
 involved but men like 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.079
 they gave account they usually throw more the 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:06.110
 blame towards a routine towards falling 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:07.520
 as in something routine of laziness that 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.220
 could encompass as the boy told us 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.660
 Australian in boredom of course 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.099
 we also run into cases in which 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.500
 one of the two parties of the couple 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.819
 does something that breaks to say it of 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.799
 somehow the feelings of the 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.560
 another person can be treated generally 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:23.569
 of infidelities or lies or 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.190
 stop wanting to be together 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.110
 Of course there are also certain factors 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.130
 that we women can control 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.319
 so that men continue to feel 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.329
 attracted to us things that they 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.430
 they could also do for us 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:36.620
 we also continue to feel attracted 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.360
 towards them we have that in another video 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.010
