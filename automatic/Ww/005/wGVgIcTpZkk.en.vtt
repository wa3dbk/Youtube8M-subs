00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
hi it's mr. Andersen and in this podcast

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.120 
hi it's mr. Andersen and in this podcast
I'm<00:00:06.870> going<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:07.080> talk<00:00:07.140> about<00:00:07.379> life<00:00:07.710> I'm

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
I'm going to talk about life I'm

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.799 
I'm going to talk about life I'm
actually<00:00:08.340> going<00:00:08.610> to<00:00:08.670> talk<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:08.849> lot<00:00:09.179> about<00:00:09.210> life

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
actually going to talk a lot about life

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.570 
actually going to talk a lot about life
because<00:00:10.050> this<00:00:10.200> is<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.469> first<00:00:10.769> in<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.130> series<00:00:11.400> of

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
because this is the first in a series of

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.820 
because this is the first in a series of
podcasts<00:00:12.360> I'll<00:00:12.450> call<00:00:12.660> life<00:00:12.929> on<00:00:13.080> earth<00:00:13.230> we're

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
podcasts I'll call life on earth we're

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.110 
podcasts I'll call life on earth we're
going<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.040> talk<00:00:14.160> about<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.429> diversity<00:00:15.000> of

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
going to talk about the diversity of

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.730 
going to talk about the diversity of
life<00:00:15.299> on<00:00:15.540> our<00:00:15.570> planet<00:00:15.690> in<00:00:16.199> this<00:00:16.410> one<00:00:16.619> we're

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
life on our planet in this one we're

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.870 
life on our planet in this one we're
going<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:16.920> talk<00:00:17.070> about<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.400> general

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
going to talk about the general

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.760 
going to talk about the general
characteristics<00:00:18.840> of<00:00:18.960> life<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.560> three

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
characteristics of life and the three

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.410 
characteristics of life and the three
domains<00:00:20.160> of<00:00:20.369> life<00:00:20.430> but<00:00:20.939> in<00:00:21.060> each<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.330> the

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
domains of life but in each of the

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.910 
domains of life but in each of the
subsequent<00:00:21.750> podcast<00:00:22.380> we'll<00:00:22.560> talk<00:00:22.740> about

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
subsequent podcast we'll talk about

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.750 
subsequent podcast we'll talk about
viruses<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.090> fungi<00:00:24.350> and<00:00:25.350> plants<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:26.160> animals

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
viruses and fungi and plants and animals

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.580 
viruses and fungi and plants and animals
and<00:00:27.000> vertebrates<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.689> invertebrates<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.470> so

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
and vertebrates and invertebrates and so

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.919 
and vertebrates and invertebrates and so
let's<00:00:28.800> get<00:00:28.949> started<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.179> let's<00:00:30.720> start

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
let's get started and so let's start

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.089 
let's get started and so let's start
with<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.080> history<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.529> life<00:00:31.740> on<00:00:31.890> our<00:00:31.949> planet

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
with the history of life on our planet

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.420 
with the history of life on our planet
so<00:00:32.910> if<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.149> earth<00:00:33.450> formed<00:00:33.840> about<00:00:34.079> 4.6<00:00:34.800> billion

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
so if the earth formed about 4.6 billion

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.940 
so if the earth formed about 4.6 billion
years<00:00:35.730> ago<00:00:35.880> life<00:00:36.149> pretty<00:00:36.600> much<00:00:36.840> shows<00:00:37.260> up<00:00:37.530> when

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
years ago life pretty much shows up when

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.889 
years ago life pretty much shows up when
the<00:00:38.190> crust<00:00:38.579> starts<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.149> cool<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:39.690> life

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
the crust starts to cool so life

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.440 
the crust starts to cool so life
actually<00:00:40.379> could<00:00:40.620> exist<00:00:40.980> than<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.309> does<00:00:41.610> first

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
actually could exist than it does first

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.139 
actually could exist than it does first
life<00:00:42.719> on<00:00:42.870> our<00:00:43.020> planet<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.469> single-cell<00:00:44.219> these

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
life on our planet is single-cell these

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.819 
life on our planet is single-cell these
are<00:00:45.300> some<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.600> most<00:00:45.719> ancient<00:00:45.870> fossils<00:00:46.710> on

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
are some of the most ancient fossils on

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:47.840 
are some of the most ancient fossils on
our<00:00:46.950> planet<00:00:47.190> these<00:00:47.399> are<00:00:47.520> actually

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
our planet these are actually

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.490 
our planet these are actually
stromatolites<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.930> these<00:00:49.050> would<00:00:49.170> be<00:00:49.230> some

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
stromatolites and these would be some

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.010 
stromatolites and these would be some
modern-day<00:00:50.489> stromatolites<00:00:51.000> remember<00:00:51.809> life

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
modern-day stromatolites remember life

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.990 
modern-day stromatolites remember life
on<00:00:52.230> our<00:00:52.469> planet<00:00:52.710> first<00:00:53.399> life<00:00:53.640> had<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:53.969> be

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
on our planet first life had to be

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.420 
on our planet first life had to be
underneath<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.570> ocean<00:00:55.170> because<00:00:56.100> there<00:00:56.309> was

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
underneath the ocean because there was

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.360 
underneath the ocean because there was
so<00:00:56.550> much<00:00:56.670> UV<00:00:57.500> radiation<00:00:58.500> when<00:00:58.739> until<00:00:59.100> we<00:00:59.219> had

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
so much UV radiation when until we had

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.670 
so much UV radiation when until we had
an<00:00:59.489> atmosphere<00:00:59.750> that<00:01:00.750> life<00:01:01.320> had<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.649> be

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
an atmosphere that life had to be

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.729 
an atmosphere that life had to be
underneath<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.250> water<00:01:02.460> but<00:01:02.760> basically<00:01:03.210> it's

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
underneath the water but basically it's

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.140 
underneath the water but basically it's
single-cell<00:01:04.739> prokaryotic<00:01:05.489> life<00:01:05.610> we<00:01:06.060> have

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
single-cell prokaryotic life we have

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.510 
single-cell prokaryotic life we have
photosynthesis<00:01:06.930> show<00:01:07.110> up<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:07.979> oxygen

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
photosynthesis show up and so oxygen

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.940 
photosynthesis show up and so oxygen
starts<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.150> accumulate<00:01:09.750> then<00:01:10.200> eukaryotic

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
starts to accumulate then eukaryotic

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.219 
starts to accumulate then eukaryotic
life<00:01:11.210> multicellular<00:01:12.210> life<00:01:12.390> like<00:01:12.750> 1<00:01:12.930> billion

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
life multicellular life like 1 billion

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.140 
life multicellular life like 1 billion
years<00:01:13.590> ago<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.400> then<00:01:14.520> all<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.880> things<00:01:14.909> that

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
years ago and then all the things that

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.179 
years ago and then all the things that
we<00:01:15.360> think<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.780> as<00:01:15.960> life<00:01:16.200> like<00:01:16.470> animals<00:01:16.950> plants

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
we think of as life like animals plants

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.219 
we think of as life like animals plants
dinosaurs<00:01:17.970> flowers<00:01:18.600> those<00:01:18.810> things<00:01:19.049> show<00:01:19.200> up

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
dinosaurs flowers those things show up

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.190 
dinosaurs flowers those things show up
fairly<00:01:19.710> recently<00:01:20.280> in<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.509> evolutionary

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
fairly recently in the evolutionary

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.380 
fairly recently in the evolutionary
history<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.159> life<00:01:23.520> on<00:01:23.729> our<00:01:23.790> planet

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
history of life on our planet

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.090 
history of life on our planet
and<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:24.930> there's<00:01:25.110> some<00:01:25.259> characteristics<00:01:26.040> that

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
and so there's some characteristics that

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.819 
and so there's some characteristics that
all<00:01:26.369> life<00:01:26.939> shares<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.840> other<00:01:27.990> words<00:01:28.229> if<00:01:28.439> you

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
all life shares in other words if you

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.770 
all life shares in other words if you
don't<00:01:29.040> have<00:01:29.250> all<00:01:29.520> seven<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.180> these<00:01:30.360> then

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
don't have all seven of these then

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.630 
don't have all seven of these then
you're<00:01:31.020> not<00:01:31.140> alive<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.829> so<00:01:32.009> first<00:01:32.310> one<00:01:32.490> is

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
you're not alive and so first one is

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.359 
you're not alive and so first one is
homeostasis<00:01:33.600> basically<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.799> can<00:01:34.979> maintain<00:01:35.159> a

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
homeostasis basically you can maintain a

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.580 
homeostasis basically you can maintain a
stable<00:01:35.820> internal<00:01:36.420> environment<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:37.320> we<00:01:37.409> do

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
stable internal environment and we do

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.350 
stable internal environment and we do
that<00:01:37.799> through<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.130> use<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.369> mostly<00:01:39.030> negative

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
that through the use of mostly negative

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.050 
that through the use of mostly negative
feedback<00:01:40.110> loops<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:41.070> have<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.280> be<00:01:41.369> organized

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
feedback loops you have to be organized

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.819 
feedback loops you have to be organized
we<00:01:42.329> go<00:01:42.450> all<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.780> way<00:01:42.810> from<00:01:43.170> atoms<00:01:43.590> and

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
we go all the way from atoms and

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.130 
we go all the way from atoms and
molecules<00:01:43.860> all<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.970> way<00:01:45.090> up<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.570> level<00:01:45.750> of

molecules all the way up to the level of
biosphere<00:01:47.100> when<00:01:47.490> we're<00:01:47.640> talking<00:01:47.729> about

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
biosphere when we're talking about

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.330 
biosphere when we're talking about
biology<00:01:48.210> but<00:01:48.689> there's<00:01:48.840> organization<00:01:49.619> most

bamboo alive yes is a panda bear alive

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.450 
bamboo alive yes is a panda bear alive
yes<00:02:23.220> is<00:02:23.520> lightning<00:02:24.360> alive<00:02:24.690> no<00:02:25.560> is<00:02:25.890> this

yes is lightning alive no is this

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.410 
yes is lightning alive no is this
stomach<00:02:27.000> alive<00:02:27.620> no<00:02:28.620> it's<00:02:29.010> not<00:02:29.370> it's<00:02:29.790> part<00:02:30.180> of<00:02:30.330> a

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
stomach alive no it's not it's part of a

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.210 
stomach alive no it's not it's part of a
living<00:02:30.690> thing<00:02:30.720> so<00:02:31.140> it's<00:02:31.260> not<00:02:31.380> able<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.830> adapt

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
or reproduce on its own it's just part

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
of a living thing and so when we're

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.660 
of a living thing and so when we're
talking<00:02:36.960> about<00:02:37.200> life<00:02:37.620> we're<00:02:37.890> not<00:02:38.130> generally

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
talking about life we're not generally

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.370 
talking about life we're not generally
talking<00:02:38.970> about<00:02:39.180> viruses<00:02:39.810> we<00:02:40.050> call<00:02:40.230> these

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
talking about viruses we call these

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.560 
talking about viruses we call these
things<00:02:40.560> non-cellular<00:02:41.280> replicators<00:02:42.270> and<00:02:42.510> so

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
things non-cellular replicators and so

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.930 
things non-cellular replicators and so
they're<00:02:42.720> not<00:02:42.840> classified<00:02:43.410> as<00:02:43.590> life<00:02:43.860> now<00:02:44.490> can

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
they're not classified as life now can

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.030 
they're not classified as life now can
they<00:02:45.090> evolve<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:45.930> change<00:02:45.960> over<00:02:46.530> time<00:02:46.800> for

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
they evolve and change over time for

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.530 
they evolve and change over time for
sure<00:02:47.220> but<00:02:47.640> they<00:02:47.760> do<00:02:47.820> that<00:02:48.180> here's<00:02:48.480> some

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
sure but they do that here's some

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.200 
sure but they do that here's some
bacteria<00:02:49.200> phages<00:02:49.440> inject<00:02:50.130> injecting<00:02:51.090> their

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
bacteria phages inject injecting their

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.630 
bacteria phages inject injecting their
DNA<00:02:51.570> into<00:02:51.840> a<00:02:51.870> bacteria<00:02:52.470> they<00:02:52.890> do<00:02:52.950> that<00:02:53.400> by

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
DNA into a bacteria they do that by

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.030 
DNA into a bacteria they do that by
using<00:02:53.880> other<00:02:54.150> cells<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:54.930> do<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.260> hard<00:02:55.470> work<00:02:55.530> or

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
using other cells to do the hard work or

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.400 
using other cells to do the hard work or
to<00:02:56.220> do<00:02:56.460> the<00:02:56.640> growth<00:02:56.850> for<00:02:57.180> them<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:57.690> so<00:02:58.140> when<00:02:58.290> we

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
to do the growth for them and so when we

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.160 
to do the growth for them and so when we
look<00:02:58.740> at<00:02:58.890> life<00:02:59.160> we<00:02:59.430> classify<00:03:00.030> life<00:03:00.270> into<00:03:00.780> one

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
look at life we classify life into one

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.160 
look at life we classify life into one
of<00:03:01.470> three<00:03:02.160> domains<00:03:02.820> and<00:03:03.360> so<00:03:03.570> this<00:03:03.870> right<00:03:04.110> here

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
of three domains and so this right here

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.580 
of three domains and so this right here
would<00:03:04.770> be<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:06.390> last<00:03:06.750> Universal<00:03:07.230> common

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
would be the last Universal common

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.320 
would be the last Universal common
ancestor

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
ancestor

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.970 
ancestor
so<00:03:09.420> that<00:03:09.570> would<00:03:09.720> be<00:03:09.750> Luca<00:03:10.380> right<00:03:10.650> here<00:03:10.890> in

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
so that would be Luca right here in

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.290 
so that would be Luca right here in
other<00:03:11.100> words<00:03:11.340> this<00:03:11.640> right<00:03:11.850> here<00:03:12.030> would<00:03:12.120> be<00:03:12.180> the

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
other words this right here would be the

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.840 
other words this right here would be the
ancestor<00:03:13.020> that<00:03:13.590> is<00:03:13.710> shared<00:03:13.920> by<00:03:14.040> all<00:03:14.070> life<00:03:14.640> on

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
ancestor that is shared by all life on

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.760 
ancestor that is shared by all life on
our<00:03:14.910> planet<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.660> so<00:03:15.720> basically<00:03:16.260> it's<00:03:16.500> broken

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
our planet and so basically it's broken

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.470 
our planet and so basically it's broken
down<00:03:17.010> into<00:03:17.070> three<00:03:17.550> domains<00:03:17.910> we've<00:03:18.300> got

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
down into three domains we've got

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.280 
down into three domains we've got
bacteria<00:03:19.230> so<00:03:19.620> something<00:03:20.010> like<00:03:20.150> e.coli<00:03:21.290> we're

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
bacteria so something like e.coli we're

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.250 
bacteria so something like e.coli we're
going<00:03:22.410> to<00:03:22.470> have<00:03:23.180> our<00:03:24.180> gay<00:03:24.510> bacteria<00:03:25.080> that's

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
going to have our gay bacteria that's

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.380 
going to have our gay bacteria that's
going<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.500> be<00:03:25.560> ancient<00:03:25.890> bacteria<00:03:26.580> things<00:03:27.239> that

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
going to be ancient bacteria things that

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.240 
going to be ancient bacteria things that
would<00:03:27.510> live<00:03:27.720> like<00:03:28.080> in<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.470> hot<00:03:28.739> pots<00:03:29.010> of

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
would live like in the hot pots of

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.860 
would live like in the hot pots of
Yellowstone<00:03:30.060> Park<00:03:30.330> and<00:03:30.540> then<00:03:30.660> we<00:03:30.780> have

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
Yellowstone Park and then we have

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.020 
Yellowstone Park and then we have
eukaryotic<00:03:31.620> life<00:03:31.800> example<00:03:32.550> of<00:03:32.640> that<00:03:32.760> would<00:03:32.970> be

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
eukaryotic life example of that would be

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.930 
eukaryotic life example of that would be
animals<00:03:33.630> fungi<00:03:33.870> and<00:03:34.260> plants<00:03:34.560> and<00:03:35.040> so<00:03:35.640> why<00:03:35.880> do

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
animals fungi and plants and so why do

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.750 
animals fungi and plants and so why do
we<00:03:36.180> classify<00:03:36.510> life<00:03:37.320> into<00:03:38.280> these<00:03:38.459> three

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
we classify life into these three

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.310 
we classify life into these three
domains<00:03:39.090> because<00:03:39.300> we<00:03:39.540> really<00:03:39.930> started<00:03:40.290> doing

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
domains because we really started doing

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.590 
domains because we really started doing
that<00:03:40.739> you<00:03:41.220> know<00:03:41.340> just<00:03:41.640> in<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:41.880> last<00:03:42.090> 30<00:03:42.480> years

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
that you know just in the last 30 years

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.120 
that you know just in the last 30 years
did<00:03:43.080> we<00:03:43.140> come<00:03:43.380> up<00:03:43.500> with<00:03:43.620> this<00:03:43.800> and<00:03:44.070> so

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
did we come up with this and so

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.370 
did we come up with this and so
basically<00:03:44.550> let's<00:03:45.000> look<00:03:45.300> at<00:03:45.570> a<00:03:45.750> Venn<00:03:46.350> diagram

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
basically let's look at a Venn diagram

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.680 
basically let's look at a Venn diagram
so<00:03:47.100> this<00:03:47.250> is<00:03:47.340> a<00:03:47.370> Venn<00:03:47.640> diagram<00:03:47.670> right<00:03:48.390> here

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
so this is a Venn diagram right here

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.870 
so this is a Venn diagram right here
this<00:03:49.200> would<00:03:49.380> be<00:03:49.440> the<00:03:49.560> eukaryotic<00:03:50.220> cells<00:03:50.640> right

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
this would be the eukaryotic cells right

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.699 
this would be the eukaryotic cells right
here<00:03:50.940> this<00:03:51.510> would<00:03:51.660> be<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.870> bacterial<00:03:52.440> cells

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
here this would be the bacterial cells

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.199 
here this would be the bacterial cells
in<00:03:52.980> here<00:03:53.250> and<00:03:53.370> this<00:03:53.489> would<00:03:53.580> be<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:53.820> archaea

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
in here and this would be the archaea

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.810 
in here and this would be the archaea
bacteria<00:03:54.300> in<00:03:54.900> here<00:03:55.200> and<00:03:55.380> so<00:03:55.860> first<00:03:56.280> let's<00:03:56.640> talk

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
bacteria in here and so first let's talk

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.850 
bacteria in here and so first let's talk
about<00:03:57.120> what's<00:03:57.360> in<00:03:57.510> the<00:03:57.570> middle<00:03:57.900> what's<00:03:58.650> some

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
about what's in the middle what's some

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.740 
about what's in the middle what's some
characteristics<00:03:59.760> that<00:03:59.940> are<00:04:00.090> shared<00:04:00.330> by<00:04:00.540> all

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
characteristics that are shared by all

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.080 
characteristics that are shared by all
life<00:04:01.320> on<00:04:01.620> our<00:04:01.650> planet<00:04:01.800> well<00:04:02.519> like<00:04:02.940> we<00:04:03.060> said

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
life on our planet well like we said

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.110 
life on our planet well like we said
they<00:04:03.570> have<00:04:03.750> they're<00:04:04.140> made<00:04:04.320> up<00:04:04.410> of<00:04:04.560> cells

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
they have they're made up of cells

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.100 
they have they're made up of cells
they've<00:04:06.120> got<00:04:06.269> some<00:04:06.510> kind<00:04:06.720> of<00:04:06.780> genetic

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
they've got some kind of genetic

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.380 
they've got some kind of genetic
materials<00:04:07.709> so<00:04:07.830> they<00:04:07.950> got<00:04:08.100> DNA<00:04:08.370> and<00:04:08.910> they<00:04:09.030> use

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
materials so they got DNA and they use

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.600 
materials so they got DNA and they use
RNA<00:04:10.019> to<00:04:10.080> do<00:04:10.290> their<00:04:10.500> work<00:04:10.709> what<00:04:11.250> else<00:04:11.430> do<00:04:11.580> they

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
RNA to do their work what else do they

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.729 
RNA to do their work what else do they
have<00:04:11.780> they're<00:04:12.780> going<00:04:12.900> to<00:04:12.959> have<00:04:13.050> a<00:04:13.080> membrane

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
have they're going to have a membrane

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.150 
have they're going to have a membrane
around<00:04:13.769> the<00:04:14.340> outside<00:04:14.840> a<00:04:15.840> cell<00:04:16.560> membrane<00:04:16.769> or<00:04:17.130> a

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
around the outside a cell membrane or a

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.920 
around the outside a cell membrane or a
plasma<00:04:17.430> membrane<00:04:17.730> what<00:04:18.390> else<00:04:18.540> do<00:04:18.690> they<00:04:18.750> have

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
plasma membrane what else do they have

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.479 
plasma membrane what else do they have
they're<00:04:19.080> going<00:04:19.109> to<00:04:19.260> have<00:04:19.380> ribosomes<00:04:19.650> because

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
they're going to have ribosomes because

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.580 
they're going to have ribosomes because
they<00:04:20.669> have<00:04:20.880> to<00:04:21.030> actually<00:04:21.419> make<00:04:21.630> a<00:04:21.660> living<00:04:21.989> so

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
they have to actually make a living so

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:23.659 
they have to actually make a living so
they're<00:04:22.710> going<00:04:22.830> to<00:04:22.890> have<00:04:23.039> to<00:04:23.190> actually<00:04:23.460> use

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
they're going to have to actually use

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.880 
they're going to have to actually use
this<00:04:23.850> DNA<00:04:24.060> to<00:04:24.300> make<00:04:24.539> proteins<00:04:25.080> and<00:04:25.289> then

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
this DNA to make proteins and then

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:26.810 
this DNA to make proteins and then
they're<00:04:26.010> going<00:04:26.130> to<00:04:26.190> have<00:04:26.310> some<00:04:26.490> kind<00:04:26.610> of<00:04:26.700> a

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
they're going to have some kind of a

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.140 
they're going to have some kind of a
site

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
site

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.659 
site
Sall<00:04:27.360> or<00:04:27.600> a<00:04:27.630> cytoplasm<00:04:28.259> so<00:04:28.560> all<00:04:28.830> life<00:04:29.370> on<00:04:29.610> our

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
Sall or a cytoplasm so all life on our

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.570 
Sall or a cytoplasm so all life on our
planet<00:04:29.790> shares<00:04:30.479> all<00:04:30.780> of<00:04:31.290> this<00:04:31.500> but<00:04:32.340> they<00:04:32.460> don't

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
planet shares all of this but they don't

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.400 
planet shares all of this but they don't
share<00:04:32.910> all<00:04:33.150> the<00:04:33.540> characteristics<00:04:34.169> so<00:04:34.259> if<00:04:34.320> we

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
share all the characteristics so if we

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.140 
share all the characteristics so if we
were<00:04:34.470> to<00:04:34.560> look<00:04:34.680> at<00:04:34.830> this<00:04:34.979> what<00:04:35.820> is<00:04:35.910> something

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
were to look at this what is something

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.779 
were to look at this what is something
that<00:04:36.300> you<00:04:36.690> carry<00:04:37.020> otic<00:04:37.320> life<00:04:37.500> have<00:04:37.800> up<00:04:38.190> here

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
that you carry otic life have up here

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:41.330 
that you carry otic life have up here
that<00:04:39.240> bacteria<00:04:39.810> on<00:04:40.020> archaea<00:04:40.440> bacteria<00:04:40.500> don't

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
that bacteria on archaea bacteria don't

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.400 
that bacteria on archaea bacteria don't
well<00:04:42.240> they're<00:04:42.630> going<00:04:42.720> to<00:04:42.810> have<00:04:42.900> a<00:04:42.930> nucleus

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
well they're going to have a nucleus

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.350 
well they're going to have a nucleus
that's<00:04:43.620> where<00:04:43.770> the<00:04:43.860> name<00:04:44.039> comes<00:04:44.310> from<00:04:44.460> what

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
that's where the name comes from what

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
that's where the name comes from what
else<00:04:45.509> are<00:04:45.660> they<00:04:45.720> going<00:04:45.930> to<00:04:45.990> have<00:04:46.110> they're

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
else are they going to have they're

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.270 
else are they going to have they're
going<00:04:46.410> to<00:04:46.560> have<00:04:46.650> organelles<00:04:48.259> now<00:04:49.259> are<00:04:49.590> all<00:04:49.949> of

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
going to have organelles now are all of

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.580 
going to have organelles now are all of
these<00:04:50.400> multicellular<00:04:51.360> not<00:04:51.720> necessarily<00:04:52.410> up

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
these multicellular not necessarily up

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:53.689 
these multicellular not necessarily up
here<00:04:52.800> but<00:04:52.949> they're<00:04:53.100> definitely<00:04:53.280> gonna<00:04:53.520> have<00:04:53.669> a

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 
here but they're definitely gonna have a

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:55.370 
here but they're definitely gonna have a
nucleus<00:04:54.090> organelles<00:04:54.600> if<00:04:54.840> we<00:04:54.930> look<00:04:55.080> down<00:04:55.110> here

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
nucleus organelles if we look down here

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.570 
nucleus organelles if we look down here
at<00:04:55.470> bacteria<00:04:55.979> what's<00:04:56.190> something<00:04:56.490> the

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
at bacteria what's something the

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.670 
at bacteria what's something the
bacteria<00:04:57.090> have<00:04:57.300> the<00:04:57.690> neither<00:04:58.050> of<00:04:58.380> the<00:04:58.530> other

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
bacteria have the neither of the other

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.100 
bacteria have the neither of the other
two<00:04:58.800> have<00:04:59.280> well<00:05:00.000> just<00:05:00.300> one<00:05:00.479> thing<00:05:00.720> to<00:05:00.900> quickly

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
two have well just one thing to quickly

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.540 
two have well just one thing to quickly
get<00:05:01.530> started<00:05:01.650> they<00:05:02.070> have<00:05:02.250> what's<00:05:02.490> called

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
get started they have what's called

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.260 
get started they have what's called
peptidoglycan<00:05:03.199> so<00:05:04.199> they<00:05:04.410> have<00:05:04.590> a<00:05:04.620> chemical<00:05:05.270> in

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
peptidoglycan so they have a chemical in

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.420 
peptidoglycan so they have a chemical in
a<00:05:06.449> bacteria<00:05:07.080> so<00:05:07.440> if<00:05:07.560> this<00:05:07.680> is<00:05:07.830> a<00:05:07.860> bacteria

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
a bacteria so if this is a bacteria

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.950 
a bacteria so if this is a bacteria
they'll<00:05:08.639> have<00:05:08.789> their<00:05:08.940> DNA<00:05:09.389> right<00:05:09.600> here<00:05:09.780> in<00:05:09.870> a

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
they'll have their DNA right here in a

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.600 
they'll have their DNA right here in a
circle<00:05:10.139> they're<00:05:10.770> basically<00:05:11.190> going<00:05:11.370> to<00:05:11.490> have<00:05:11.580> a

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
circle they're basically going to have a

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.310 
circle they're basically going to have a
chemical<00:05:12.210> that<00:05:12.330> makes<00:05:12.570> up<00:05:12.750> the<00:05:12.870> cell<00:05:13.080> wall

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
chemical that makes up the cell wall

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.350 
chemical that makes up the cell wall
around<00:05:13.680> the<00:05:13.800> outside<00:05:14.220> and<00:05:14.520> that's<00:05:14.910> made<00:05:15.120> up<00:05:15.270> of

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
around the outside and that's made up of

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.779 
around the outside and that's made up of
a<00:05:15.449> chemical<00:05:15.840> called<00:05:16.050> peptidoglycan<00:05:16.789> luckily

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:17.789 
a chemical called peptidoglycan luckily

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:19.850 
a chemical called peptidoglycan luckily
they<00:05:18.419> have<00:05:18.570> peptidoglycan<00:05:18.930> because<00:05:19.500> we<00:05:19.680> can

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
they have peptidoglycan because we can

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.490 
they have peptidoglycan because we can
use<00:05:19.979> antibiotics<00:05:20.639> to<00:05:20.789> actually<00:05:21.330> kill<00:05:21.570> them<00:05:21.780> if

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
use antibiotics to actually kill them if

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.689 
use antibiotics to actually kill them if
we<00:05:22.650> look<00:05:22.830> over<00:05:22.949> here<00:05:23.070> at<00:05:23.280> archaea<00:05:23.610> bacteria

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:23.699 
we look over here at archaea bacteria

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:26.749 
we look over here at archaea bacteria
they<00:05:24.240> we<00:05:24.660> classified<00:05:25.349> them<00:05:25.590> as<00:05:25.620> with<00:05:26.550> the

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:26.759 
they we classified them as with the

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:28.370 
they we classified them as with the
bacteria<00:05:27.180> in<00:05:27.270> a<00:05:27.360> group<00:05:27.539> called<00:05:27.780> Meniere's<00:05:28.110> for

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
bacteria in a group called Meniere's for

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.070 
bacteria in a group called Meniere's for
a<00:05:28.410> long<00:05:28.740> period<00:05:29.280> of<00:05:29.340> time<00:05:29.520> but<00:05:30.479> basically<00:05:30.840> we

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
a long period of time but basically we

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.150 
a long period of time but basically we
realize<00:05:31.470> that<00:05:31.500> they<00:05:31.830> don't<00:05:31.949> have

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
realize that they don't have

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.890 
realize that they don't have
peptidoglycan<00:05:32.550> and<00:05:33.210> they've<00:05:33.720> got

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
peptidoglycan and they've got

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.040 
peptidoglycan and they've got
differences<00:05:34.710> that<00:05:35.010> make<00:05:35.250> them<00:05:35.520> their<00:05:35.789> own

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
differences that make them their own

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.360 
differences that make them their own
domain<00:05:37.050> and<00:05:37.380> so<00:05:37.590> one<00:05:37.860> thing<00:05:37.889> that<00:05:38.099> you

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
domain and so one thing that you

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.680 
domain and so one thing that you
probably<00:05:38.580> are<00:05:38.820> familiar<00:05:39.270> with<00:05:39.389> is<00:05:39.660> the

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
probably are familiar with is the

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.379 
probably are familiar with is the
archaea<00:05:40.169> bacteria<00:05:40.199> live<00:05:40.830> incredibly<00:05:41.639> harsh

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389 
archaea bacteria live incredibly harsh

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:44.930 
archaea bacteria live incredibly harsh
environments<00:05:43.320> but<00:05:44.039> you<00:05:44.159> probably<00:05:44.520> didn't

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
environments but you probably didn't

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.310 
environments but you probably didn't
know<00:05:45.090> is<00:05:45.360> that<00:05:45.900> they<00:05:46.080> have<00:05:46.110> the

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
know is that they have the

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.719 
know is that they have the
characteristic<00:05:47.099> that<00:05:47.130> makes<00:05:47.280> them<00:05:47.550> much

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:47.729 
characteristic that makes them much

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:49.430 
characteristic that makes them much
different<00:05:48.180> so<00:05:48.330> if<00:05:48.389> we<00:05:48.539> were<00:05:48.599> to<00:05:48.690> look<00:05:48.810> at<00:05:48.960> their

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
different so if we were to look at their

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.700 
different so if we were to look at their
on<00:05:49.970> their<00:05:50.970> membranes<00:05:51.570> this<00:05:52.169> is<00:05:52.349> going<00:05:52.500> to<00:05:52.560> be<00:05:52.680> a

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
on their membranes this is going to be a

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.089 
on their membranes this is going to be a
phospholipid<00:05:53.990> so<00:05:54.990> this<00:05:55.320> is<00:05:55.530> a<00:05:55.560> phospholipid

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:56.099 
phospholipid so this is a phospholipid

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:58.850 
phospholipid so this is a phospholipid
in<00:05:56.729> a<00:05:56.880> typical<00:05:57.449> eukaryotic<00:05:58.409> cell

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
in a typical eukaryotic cell

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.140 
in a typical eukaryotic cell
so<00:05:59.610> like<00:05:59.940> this<00:06:00.440> remember<00:06:01.440> our<00:06:01.970> membrane<00:06:02.970> is

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
so like this remember our membrane is

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.120 
so like this remember our membrane is
made<00:06:03.330> up<00:06:03.479> of<00:06:03.599> a<00:06:03.720> phospholipid<00:06:04.110> bilayer<00:06:04.770> so

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130 
made up of a phospholipid bilayer so

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:06.170 
made up of a phospholipid bilayer so
it's<00:06:05.250> going<00:06:05.370> to<00:06:05.430> be<00:06:05.520> a<00:06:05.550> number<00:06:05.970> of<00:06:06.060> these

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
it's going to be a number of these

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.360 
it's going to be a number of these
repeated<00:06:06.630> over<00:06:06.750> and<00:06:06.870> over<00:06:07.080> and<00:06:07.289> over<00:06:07.409> again<00:06:07.620> if

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370 
repeated over and over and over again if

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.279 
repeated over and over and over again if
you<00:06:08.550> were<00:06:08.669> to<00:06:08.789> look<00:06:08.970> at<00:06:09.120> it<00:06:09.180> and<00:06:09.419> eukaryotic<00:06:09.930> or

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:10.289 
you were to look at it and eukaryotic or

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:11.930 
you were to look at it and eukaryotic or
a<00:06:10.320> bacterial<00:06:10.800> cell<00:06:11.010> is<00:06:11.039> going<00:06:11.340> to<00:06:11.400> gel<00:06:11.580> just

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
a bacterial cell is going to gel just

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.580 
a bacterial cell is going to gel just
like<00:06:12.090> that<00:06:12.330> but<00:06:12.690> if<00:06:12.780> we<00:06:12.870> were<00:06:12.960> to<00:06:13.080> look<00:06:13.229> at<00:06:13.440> it

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
like that but if we were to look at it

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.920 
like that but if we were to look at it
in<00:06:14.010> on<00:06:14.220> let's<00:06:14.849> find<00:06:15.030> a<00:06:15.150> different<00:06:15.180> color<00:06:15.630> in

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
in on let's find a different color in

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.200 
in on let's find a different color in
archaea<00:06:16.470> bacteria<00:06:16.820> there's<00:06:17.820> looks<00:06:18.060> way

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210 
archaea bacteria there's looks way

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.180 
archaea bacteria there's looks way
different<00:06:18.240> so<00:06:18.900> they're<00:06:19.050> going<00:06:19.139> to<00:06:19.229> have<00:06:19.440> not

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
different so they're going to have not

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.890 
different so they're going to have not
only<00:06:20.250> these<00:06:20.699> hydrocarbon<00:06:21.360> tails<00:06:21.539> but<00:06:21.810> they're

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
only these hydrocarbon tails but they're

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:22.670 
only these hydrocarbon tails but they're
going<00:06:21.990> to<00:06:22.050> have<00:06:22.110> branched<00:06:22.590> hydrocarbons

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
going to have branched hydrocarbons

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.439 
going to have branched hydrocarbons
tails<00:06:23.490> so<00:06:23.699> they're<00:06:23.820> going<00:06:23.909> to<00:06:24.000> branch<00:06:24.240> off

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:24.449 
tails so they're going to branch off

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:28.010 
tails so they're going to branch off
like<00:06:24.720> that<00:06:24.900> and<00:06:25.940> they<00:06:26.940> also<00:06:27.150> sometimes<00:06:27.570> will

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 
like that and they also sometimes will

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.750 
like that and they also sometimes will
form<00:06:28.500> so<00:06:28.800> if<00:06:28.860> this<00:06:29.010> is<00:06:29.159> the<00:06:29.310> other<00:06:29.490> side

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:29.760 
form so if this is the other side

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.719 
form so if this is the other side
they'll<00:06:29.940> actually<00:06:30.360> attach<00:06:30.810> on<00:06:31.139> either<00:06:31.260> side

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:31.729 
they'll actually attach on either side

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:33.790 
they'll actually attach on either side
like<00:06:32.729> that

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:33.800 
like that

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.640 
like that
and<00:06:33.889> they'll<00:06:34.699> form<00:06:35.060> just<00:06:35.300> a<00:06:35.419> monolayer<00:06:36.110> so

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:36.650 
and they'll form just a monolayer so

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:37.960 
and they'll form just a monolayer so
it's<00:06:36.770> going<00:06:36.860> to<00:06:36.949> be<00:06:37.039> attached<00:06:37.310> all<00:06:37.550> the<00:06:37.879> way

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:37.970 
it's going to be attached all the way

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.460 
it's going to be attached all the way
across<00:06:38.300> and<00:06:38.419> so<00:06:38.870> this<00:06:38.990> is<00:06:39.139> going<00:06:39.259> to<00:06:39.319> be<00:06:39.440> a

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:39.470 
across and so this is going to be a

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.290 
across and so this is going to be a
characteristic<00:06:40.159> that<00:06:40.190> just<00:06:40.520> archaea<00:06:40.970> have

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300 
characteristic that just archaea have

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.480 
characteristic that just archaea have
why<00:06:42.229> do<00:06:42.289> they<00:06:42.530> have<00:06:42.740> a<00:06:42.770> membrane<00:06:43.099> that<00:06:43.190> looks

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:43.490 
why do they have a membrane that looks

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.339 
why do they have a membrane that looks
like<00:06:43.639> that<00:06:43.819> well<00:06:44.150> if<00:06:44.449> they<00:06:44.659> live<00:06:44.960> in<00:06:44.990> a<00:06:45.199> harsh

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:45.349 
like that well if they live in a harsh

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:46.809 
like that well if they live in a harsh
environment<00:06:45.440> that<00:06:46.069> allows<00:06:46.310> their<00:06:46.490> membrane

00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:46.819 
environment that allows their membrane

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:49.029 
environment that allows their membrane
to<00:06:47.000> kind<00:06:47.240> of<00:06:47.360> stay<00:06:47.629> attached<00:06:48.319> together<00:06:48.620> when

00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:49.039 
to kind of stay attached together when

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:50.529 
to kind of stay attached together when
the<00:06:49.129> temperature<00:06:49.490> gets<00:06:49.639> really<00:06:50.030> high<00:06:50.210> or<00:06:50.449> the

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:50.539 
the temperature gets really high or the

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:53.140 
the temperature gets really high or the
pH<00:06:50.750> changes<00:06:51.409> radically<00:06:51.740> and<00:06:52.250> so<00:06:52.789> basically

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:53.150 
pH changes radically and so basically

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:54.909 
pH changes radically and so basically
what<00:06:53.330> scientists<00:06:53.780> did<00:06:53.990> is<00:06:54.169> they<00:06:54.319> looked<00:06:54.349> at

00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:54.919 
what scientists did is they looked at

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:57.909 
what scientists did is they looked at
all<00:06:55.849> the<00:06:56.270> characteristics<00:06:56.690> of<00:06:57.199> archaea

00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:57.919 
all the characteristics of archaea

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:00.969 
all the characteristics of archaea
bacteria<00:06:58.190> and<00:06:59.169> Eukarya<00:07:00.169> and<00:07:00.379> they<00:07:00.470> found<00:07:00.680> that

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:00.979 
bacteria and Eukarya and they found that

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:02.830 
bacteria and Eukarya and they found that
there's<00:07:01.129> a<00:07:01.190> whole<00:07:01.400> heck<00:07:01.699> of<00:07:01.729> a<00:07:01.879> lot<00:07:01.909> more<00:07:02.419> in

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:02.840 
there's a whole heck of a lot more in

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.529 
there's a whole heck of a lot more in
this<00:07:03.229> area<00:07:03.699> things<00:07:04.699> that<00:07:04.879> are<00:07:04.970> shared<00:07:05.240> by

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:05.539 
this area things that are shared by

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:08.230 
this area things that are shared by
eukaryotes<00:07:06.289> and<00:07:06.650> archaea<00:07:07.250> and<00:07:07.490> not<00:07:07.759> shared<00:07:08.150> by

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240 
eukaryotes and archaea and not shared by

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.439 
eukaryotes and archaea and not shared by
bacteria<00:07:09.110> and<00:07:09.460> archaea<00:07:10.460> and<00:07:10.759> so<00:07:10.909> we<00:07:11.060> ended<00:07:11.330> up

00:07:11.439 --> 00:07:11.449 
bacteria and archaea and so we ended up

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:14.290 
bacteria and archaea and so we ended up
classifying<00:07:12.139> us<00:07:12.310> more<00:07:13.310> related<00:07:13.849> to<00:07:13.879> archaea

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:14.300 
classifying us more related to archaea

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.570 
classifying us more related to archaea
bacteria<00:07:14.360> than<00:07:15.020> them<00:07:15.229> and<00:07:15.500> so<00:07:16.370> that's

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:16.580 
bacteria than them and so that's

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.360 
bacteria than them and so that's
basically<00:07:17.030> our<00:07:17.330> three<00:07:17.780> domains<00:07:18.379> but<00:07:19.190> now

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:19.370 
basically our three domains but now

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:20.589 
basically our three domains but now
we're<00:07:19.550> going<00:07:19.639> to<00:07:19.699> kind<00:07:19.909> of<00:07:19.969> work<00:07:20.180> into<00:07:20.360> more

00:07:20.589 --> 00:07:20.599 
we're going to kind of work into more

00:07:20.599 --> 00:07:21.909 
we're going to kind of work into more
detail<00:07:20.960> in<00:07:20.990> each<00:07:21.229> of<00:07:21.379> these<00:07:21.469> different<00:07:21.710> groups

00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:21.919 
detail in each of these different groups

00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:23.290 
detail in each of these different groups
and<00:07:22.310> we're<00:07:22.430> going<00:07:22.550> to<00:07:22.610> spend<00:07:22.759> a<00:07:22.789> lot<00:07:22.969> of<00:07:23.150> time

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:23.300 
and we're going to spend a lot of time

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.999 
and we're going to spend a lot of time
in<00:07:23.479> the<00:07:23.569> eukaryotes<00:07:24.139> because<00:07:24.530> that's<00:07:24.710> what<00:07:24.860> we

00:07:24.999 --> 00:07:25.009 
in the eukaryotes because that's what we

00:07:25.009 --> 00:07:27.520 
in the eukaryotes because that's what we
are<00:07:25.039> and<00:07:25.370> so<00:07:25.969> that's<00:07:26.750> a<00:07:26.840> first<00:07:27.050> start<00:07:27.259> that's

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:27.530 
are and so that's a first start that's

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.699 
are and so that's a first start that's
life<00:07:27.770> and<00:07:28.009> I<00:07:28.250> hope<00:07:28.400> that's<00:07:28.580> helpful
