00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:10.019
 to those in the thick jungle covered by the 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.900
 green mantle of the undergrowth is a wall 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.329
 so that some believe that it could 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.090
 change the history of our country with 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:20.730
 80 meters high and composed by 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.759
 huge rectangular rocks placed 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.609
 one over another this could be the 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:28.830
 finding something surprising who 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.439
 I could have taken these stones to 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.360
 this place so remote fernando ehlers and 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.910
 Javier Mendez lead us through 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.850
 dangerous trails to get to the most 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.739
 deep of the llanganates and get to see 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.739
 a pyramid in the middle of the jungle 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.180
 they find in the jungles of ecuador the 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.180
 lost city of the giants 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.290
 a news that did not take long to give the 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.290
 Around the World 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.960
 few hours after having been 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.110
 published by the Russian portal rt in 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.110
 internet this curious owner had been 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.660
 retweeted thousands of times and is that not 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.950
 every day similar 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.680
 find 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.810
 invaded by curiosity we decided 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.450
 take the road to check that 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.570
 there was true in such a surprising 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.880
 news we leave early from the city 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.450
 of baths province of tungurahua with 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.909
 direction towards east we go 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.310
 towards the black river in search of a 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.310
 pyramid of which a lot is being 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.189
 speaking the researcher manuel palaces 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.469
 and his father Andrew palaces geologist of 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.960
 profession accompanied us to the 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:44.640
 enclosure in azuay located in the parish 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.920
 Black river 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.240
 this would be the meeting place with the 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.240
 rest of the expedition team 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.830
 5 members of the Ecuadorian army 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.320
 belonging to the squadron ideas and the 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.510
 vinuesa wilder guide is one of the 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.420
 first to have reached the 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.860
 Mysterious structure are now the i's 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.840
 for the seven we are in the sector 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.070
 today we are putting in a 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.170
 kilometer and a half more or less to 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.410
 start the route towards the ruins of 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.410
 saqqara 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.500
 to reinforce the team's safety a 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.440
 powerful being with boxer's name 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.440
 would come along with us that man as he 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:29.180
 called tyson tyson and he comes with 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.180
 us and he always of aluminum 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.480
 after a small stretch on ballast road 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.580
 We arrive to a paddock located in the 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:41.560
 buffer zone of the park 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:44.280
 national llanganates ting going to my 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.320
 well is roughly an hour and a half 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.910
 seeing the passage of city between three and 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.670
 three and a half hours 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.440
 Yes, the soil is dry but 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.840
 the recent rains had 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.690
 transformed parts of the path into a 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.110
 muddy swamp I stayed here for 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.110
 talkative 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:12.210
 look at that beautiful landscape that forest 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.900
 almost untouched which is opposite 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:18.870
 us but unfortunately for every 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.990
 one of those forests we found 234 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.420
 pastures there are the cows and it is that 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:27.540
 the hooves of the cows loosen and 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.700
 they destroy the humid floor previously forested and 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.540
 hinder the passage of those who dare 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.540
 to follow this path 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:42.510
 where other dangers also inhabit 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.210
 this moment we are going to spend the stretch of 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.460
 the bees that are later 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.760
 all be quiet and let's go with 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.819
 watch out 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.370
 a swarm of africanized bees we 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:57.400
 said Wilder has already wreaked havoc on 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:00.989
 previous expeditions causing 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.989
 intense pain and fever 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:10.400
 the noise could attract them to us 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.400
 so silence was obligatory 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.470
 of their trunks on their backs 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.040
 we draw this obstacle without major 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.510
 difficulty so later 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:29.280
 we took a break where we could 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.280
 converse with our companions 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.670
 the soldiers ibias about the hard 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.160
 work they do in the jungles 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.690
 equatorial in the war of 95 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.630
 the Libyan soldier was the one who served 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.370
 guide in the high cenepa to the patrols 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.110
 of the army that with specials that 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.850
 they were already fighting thanks to 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.740
 knowledge to central they give the 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.540
 displacement they have in jungle they 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.320
 they become highly specialized soldier 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.320
 to fight it 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.190
 about two hours we barely had less 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.680
 half way through a 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.720
 forest that although it looks lush has 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.240
 been heavily intervened by the 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.750
 man because we do not have more than 5% of 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.750
 virgin mountain 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:17.509
 water is abundant in this area 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:20.539
 after quenching the thirst machete in hand 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:23.270
 we walked approximately for half an hour 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:25.610
 more until reaching a paddock that 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:28.099
 it denoted a recent human presence 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:31.310
 we arrived at the cottage a rudimentary 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:33.530
 wooden hut served as a refuge for 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:39.550
 take shelter from the rain that began to 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:39.550
 fall more strongly 500 meters 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:45.070
 we left the cabin and headed towards 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:48.010
 a broken 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:51.040
 where we expected about 300 meters 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.900
 of descent between the mud and branches 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.720
 we should cross a river and there 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.450
 find a formation full of 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.760
 imposing mystery and beauty 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:04.030
 rock formations that astonish 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.950
 scientists and curious around the world 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.050
 how the presence of 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:11.850
 similar structure in the middle of the 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.850
 jungle in a moment
