00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.930
 August 5, 2015 and analyzes it by 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.880
 the channel and here below the description 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.800
 you will have the video in which analyzed and good 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.460
 I put the challenge of 500 lines to overcome those 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.110
 likes and I'm seeing that a flora 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.949
 my mother what I just saw there from 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:39.170
 uncle uncle and god what fear and good 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:41.600
 we start with these hidden novelties 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.610
 we're going to it in total found two 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.050
 Hidden news when I say news 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.399
 or turns I always mean novelties 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.750
 that they have told us in an official way but 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.699
 that the minecraft community 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.320
 users also investigating fear 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:53.300
 positioning in networks or in different 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.430
 forums and good first all new 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.729
 the heads both the skeleton the 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.409
 of the creever and the zombie and you know 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:02.780
 that we can put these heads in 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:04.519
 our character is to say here what 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.800
 we can wear as here 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.110
 but the novelty is that there is a change and 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.759
 is because you have a head you will avoid 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.920
 for example the zombie if you would have 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.810
 Zombie will see you more easily 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.100
 clipper see you more easily 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.810
 now is that so much with more 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.039
 ease that is to say the 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.990
 ease in which this 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:23.479
 tve according to the size that has strength by 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.060
 example I have put here a dispenser 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.869
 with creepers and give you an example 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.869
 clipper can not see 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.320
 but can not see at a distance of 16 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.729
 blocks is to say from here and this 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.710
 block towards haiti is the block that 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.710
 let's give an example of starting here 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.570
 we appear for the background and this writes 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.420
 and from here you can see me all by 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.369
 here gives me small kicks there comes 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.350
 well as you see at a distance and six 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.170
 blocks but now the change I will kill 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.090
 he dies small children 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.880
 so many that nobody lowers the sound that the 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.640
 another one that is very very high is worth crying 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.750
 is also that if you put the head of the 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.729
 creever in this case for your life 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.780
 familiar a kripper script in which we 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.640
 we find around the world and we have the 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.209
 house in first place then now we 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.280
 will see a reduced instance that is to say 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.769
 from eight blocks I'm going to put myself in 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.170
 survival mode because as we see here 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.940
 from here to there to youtube what and from 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.799
 that darker blue so ya youtube what 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.739
 that a total of 16 blocks up to where 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.000
 the clippers there is the crime and we're going 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.739
 to see that he's going to see me until 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.569
 get there because as I say in 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.370
 total before I had country and century x 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.140
 jermaine is short eight blocks now 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.420
 when I entered a room and I what 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.430
 is going to start seeing me is going to attack me there 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.170
 comes there are added goods or gone crazy 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.400
 could have but there it comes is 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.019
 coming what is is a little bit back 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.030
 crazy let's do the field again 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.400
 so that it looks good 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.310
 It has gone mad and May Cry 4 Leandro 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.250
 death again I'm going to do it with the 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.830
 survival 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.750
 we will put a creepers and from here 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.290
 at 8 distances with the head put 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.219
 when will you see me 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.219
 Hello little one 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:08.939
 and it 's fine you're a bit silly but to 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.170
 from here it reacts 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:12.209
 thanks to the head and if we do not have it 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.430
 the head from here difficult what 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.769
 that would really push the change 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.140
 well it's pretty good in the sense 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.909
 that if you go around the world and have a 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.069
 head to look and it's night you 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:24.659
 you put and so you avoid having as 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.060
 ease but I already say from today or 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:28.709
 what he will see with ease and tape 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.780
 mind from 16 as always past 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.220
 minecraft and good on the other hand boy and 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.500
 a new entity that is the ball that 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.510
 disposes the dragon of gestha good that 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.010
 we have here here is 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.840
 we eat that in the particle of transit 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.389
 the bet independently because 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.730
 previously this fireball is 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:46.680
 molded on top of a pig I know for 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.169
 what would have the particle in question 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.150
 this entity before was like a single 

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:53.310
 as a normal firewall that in this case 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.329
 this book is around here until less 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.430
 over here is that this fireball 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:59.489
 we put in here and fire pit obviously 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.310
 icons around here in this case is juice 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.810
 adored dragon grandmother dragon firewall 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.580
 what is the entity that implemented 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.710
 as I say 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.240
 and this would be the normal grandma fire emo 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.640
 what is this server carrying 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.680
 Majes vast difference is made to 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.840
 fire that is the grandmother of the certain go and 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.920
 are game trucks and particles and 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.570
 even say that the safest 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.519
 change the texture of the video that in the 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.350
 console version this dragon ball 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.910
 is violet as I said in the video of 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.200
 yesterday and in this case the moment is like 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.170
 if it were normal like this one here 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.480
 we can here is the same texture of 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:31.130
 orange color but the safest thing is 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.930
 that put purple because 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.940
 he indicated more logical since the sig yesterday 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.160
 towards you is going to see the balls on top of 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.410
