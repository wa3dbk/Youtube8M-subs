by<00:01:51.969> me<00:01:52.179> I<00:01:52.389> think<00:01:52.659> in<00:01:52.810> the<00:01:52.899> mid-foot<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:53.349> game

00:01:53.519 --> 00:01:53.529 
by me I think in the mid-foot the game

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:55.199 
by me I think in the mid-foot the game
was<00:01:53.740> won<00:01:53.950> in<00:01:54.099> the<00:01:54.130> midfield<00:01:54.369> in<00:01:54.609> my<00:01:54.729> opinion<00:01:54.999> as

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:55.209 
was won in the midfield in my opinion as

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:58.199 
was won in the midfield in my opinion as
M<00:01:55.389> schweinsteiger<00:01:56.200> Martinez<00:01:57.130> and<00:01:57.399> Athiya

00:01:58.199 --> 00:01:58.209

Toni Kroos they Dave just dominated at

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:03.239 
Toni Kroos they Dave just dominated at
midfield<00:02:00.759> area<00:02:01.239> I<00:02:01.359> mean<00:02:01.840> Santi<00:02:02.200> Cazorla<00:02:02.289> for

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:03.249 
midfield area I mean Santi Cazorla for

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:04.409 
midfield area I mean Santi Cazorla for
Arsenal<00:02:03.549> he<00:02:03.609> was<00:02:03.700> usually<00:02:03.819> one<00:02:03.999> of<00:02:04.119> the<00:02:04.239> best

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:04.419 
Arsenal he was usually one of the best

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:06.539 
Arsenal he was usually one of the best
players<00:02:04.630> like<00:02:04.929> he<00:02:05.349> wasn't<00:02:05.560> that<00:02:05.979> great<00:02:06.279> like

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
players like he wasn't that great like

last<00:02:06.819> night<00:02:07.029> in<00:02:07.119> my<00:02:07.239> opinion<00:02:07.479> and<00:02:07.749> you<00:02:08.500> just

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
last night in my opinion and you just

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.770 
last night in my opinion and you just
seem<00:02:08.800> to<00:02:08.830> not<00:02:09.580> be<00:02:09.640> as<00:02:09.850> comfortable<00:02:10.119> I<00:02:10.540> think

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
seem to not be as comfortable I think

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.150 
seem to not be as comfortable I think
it's<00:02:10.869> cuz<00:02:10.990> the<00:02:11.110> pressure<00:02:11.380> Martinez<00:02:11.890> has<00:02:11.980> put

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
it's cuz the pressure Martinez has put

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.870 
it's cuz the pressure Martinez has put
on

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:22.479 
aight on target so my finish it was

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:25.500 
aight on target so my finish it was
pretty<00:06:22.750> accurate<00:06:23.229> and<00:06:23.410> I<00:06:24.190> rated<00:06:25.090> on<00:06:25.240> the<00:06:25.330> style

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:25.510 
pretty accurate and I rated on the style

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.629 
pretty accurate and I rated on the style
in<00:06:25.780> the<00:06:25.870> second<00:06:26.200> half<00:06:26.320> so<00:06:26.560> that<00:06:26.860> was<00:06:27.220> pretty

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639 
in the second half so that was pretty

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:29.490 
in the second half so that was pretty
way<00:06:27.849> quick<00:06:28.180> had<00:06:28.780> a<00:06:28.810> hundred<00:06:29.050> set<00:06:29.260> shot

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:29.500 
way quick had a hundred set shot

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.100 
way quick had a hundred set shot
accuracy<00:06:29.770> so<00:06:30.250> thatís<00:06:30.789> nice<00:06:30.940> play<00:06:31.210> and<00:06:31.389> a<00:06:31.810> four

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.110 
accuracy so thatís nice play and a four

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.050 
accuracy so thatís nice play and a four
percent<00:06:32.320> parsecs<00:06:32.889> is<00:06:33.099> well<00:06:33.250> so<00:06:33.400> the<00:06:33.520> midfield

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.060 
percent parsecs is well so the midfield

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.270 
percent parsecs is well so the midfield
I<00:06:34.240> think<00:06:34.840> they<00:06:34.930> all<00:06:35.020> have<00:06:35.140> a<00:06:35.530> 6<00:06:35.919> or<00:06:36.010> above<00:06:36.070> a

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.280 
I think they all have a 6 or above a

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.240 
I think they all have a 6 or above a
passing<00:06:36.880> which<00:06:37.330> proves<00:06:37.630> to<00:06:37.719> be<00:06:37.780> a<00:06:37.990> nicer<00:06:38.320> bit

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:39.250 
passing which proves to be a nicer bit

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:40.410 
passing which proves to be a nicer bit
of<00:06:39.460> nice

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:40.420 
of nice

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.270 
of nice
