00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:07.270 

this<00:00:01.949> is<00:00:02.129> me<00:00:02.370> under<00:00:02.879> the<00:00:03.060> mac<00:00:03.270> on<00:00:05.000> Castle<00:00:06.000> and

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:07.280 
this is me under the mac on Castle and

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.400 
this is me under the mac on Castle and
you<00:00:08.280> can<00:00:08.519> kill<00:00:08.820> people<00:00:11.929> it's<00:00:12.929> pretty<00:00:13.200> much

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
you can kill people it's pretty much

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.369 
you can kill people it's pretty much
like<00:00:13.469> every<00:00:14.009> other<00:00:14.219> thing<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:14.940> then<00:00:15.780> you<00:00:16.199> can

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
like every other thing and then you can

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.760 
like every other thing and then you can
get<00:00:16.590> out<00:00:16.710> of<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.920> map<00:00:18.170> but<00:00:19.170> then<00:00:19.380> you<00:00:19.529> can't

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
get out of the map but then you can't

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.870 
get out of the map but then you can't
get<00:00:19.890> back<00:00:20.070> in<00:00:20.310> so<00:00:20.840> it's<00:00:21.840> kind<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.289> risk<00:00:22.880> but

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
get back in so it's kind of a risk but

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.480 
get back in so it's kind of a risk but

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
you can go outside and then you want to

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.910 
you can go outside and then you want to
watch<00:00:29.640> out<00:00:29.880> for<00:00:30.119> death<00:00:30.390> holes<00:00:30.689> as<00:00:31.320> those<00:00:31.740> are
