00:00:00.139 --> 00:00:03.339
 And the lion is the leader here. 

00:00:03.339 --> 00:00:06.839
 There are about 2,000 lions in Serengeti. 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.749
 Among 35 species of cats worldwide 

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:12.099
 The lion is the only kind of social animal 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:14.219
 The lion is also a maternal animal 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.019
 This family consists of a donkey named Namanga and her two daughters. 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:21.219
 And nine grandchildren 

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:29.989
 The reason why lions live in groups 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:32.439
 Because it is good for feeding offspring 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.969
 The lioness will not only feed the baby lions 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.389
 The lions get multiple antibodies by eating different milk 

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:40.759
 To improve immunity 

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:44.149
 After the mother dies, she will take care of the little lion by her aunt or donkey. 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:57.689
 The community also helps protect the lion from invaders. 

00:01:06.279 --> 00:01:10.129
 Hyena is the most important object to guard against 

00:01:10.129 --> 00:01:12.109
 Inattention 

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:13.879
 Will take away the little lion 

00:01:30.199 --> 00:01:33.459
 Dina Manga decided to transfer her position 

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:36.709
 This is a decision for the safety of foraging and the little lions. 

00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:49.239
 Antelope is an animal visible everywhere in Serengeti 

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:51.639
 Also a favorite of the lion 

00:01:55.339 --> 00:01:58.329
 Na Manjia and her two daughters also keep up with the antelope 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:09.699
 Na Manjia is ready to hunt 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:18.739
 The little lions are hiding and watching this all quietly. 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.599
 The lion who catches the prey bites his neck or nose to suffocate 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.499
 It’s no easy task for an antelope to weigh 200 kilograms against a lion. 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:48.979
 The lion has been exhausted after a fight. 

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:57.579
 The little lions are enjoying the meal with the lion’s lead. 

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:07.029
 Even members who are not involved in hunting 

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:08.769
 Also share food fairly 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.099
 This is also one of the original intentions of the group. 

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:15.179
 Coming to a group of uninvited guests 

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:19.849
 The hyena can smell the bloody smell 20 kilometers away. 

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:25.129
 Another uninvited guest is a wandering male lion 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.699
 The wandering male lion may come to grab food at any time. 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.319
 Attack is the best defense 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.879
 If it’s one-on-one, it’s not a male lion. 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.869
 But the lions are three of them. 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.969
 If you don’t do it thoroughly, you will get into trouble. 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:01.839
 Na Manjia’s mother and daughter decided to eradicate the bane 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:14.039
 When the three mothers and daughters are busy chasing the male lion 

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:17.409
 Eagles and hyenas sneak in 

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:22.899
 The little lions do not have the protection of the lioness 

00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:26.489
 Then quietly hiding in the grass, dare not make a sound 

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:31.969
 Na Manga discovers a group of predators 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:35.069
 First, a violent offensive against the eagle 

00:04:36.679 --> 00:04:40.719
 Driven away the predator lioness but lost more than it 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:46.769
 A little lion is gone 

00:04:46.769 --> 00:04:49.229
 Become a beautiful dog 

00:04:53.799 --> 00:04:56.129
 It all happened in an instant 

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:13.939
 Na Manjia hurriedly summoned all the little lions to leave this right and wrong. 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:21.889
 The lion's survival rate is very low 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.509
 Eighty percent of the little lions will die in two years after birth. 

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:32.599
 It’s not easy to walk 50 cm high in the grass. 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:35.869
 The lioness leads the tired little lion to the driveway. 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:47.359
 The old man who can always be physically weak can’t help but decide to squat down. 

00:05:53.989 --> 00:05:56.949
 The lion can never tolerate the arbitrariness of the little lion 

00:05:56.949 --> 00:05:58.679
 In order to survive in the grasslands 

00:05:58.679 --> 00:06:01.479
 First, learn toughness and patience. 

00:06:08.429 --> 00:06:10.949
 The lane is not safe 

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:21.939
 Fortunately, the old and the young are shocked. 

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:29.289
 The lion is good at expressing love with action 

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:31.049
 Even after the reunion 

00:06:31.049 --> 00:06:34.199
 Also caress 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:51.619
 Na Manga decided to take a break here. 

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:53.679
 Although located next to the driveway 

00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:56.749
 But I can hide from the heat of up to 35 degrees. 

00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:58.429
 It is a good place to take a cool place 

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:05.149
 Lions generally live in a 60-kilometer area 

00:07:05.149 --> 00:07:08.909
 Foraging and looking for water in this range 

00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:14.869
 Yana Manjia hesitated for a moment 

00:07:14.869 --> 00:07:17.359
 Decided to go back to the grassland 

00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:25.629
 For the lioness, this is a stream where the creek is very wide for the lion. 

00:07:46.439 --> 00:07:49.009
 The bravest big brother leads the way 

00:08:00.619 --> 00:08:02.409
 Two small left 

00:08:05.989 --> 00:08:10.209
 The clever little guy found the narrowest part of the creek 

00:08:10.209 --> 00:08:13.939
 This is how the little lion learns how to live.
