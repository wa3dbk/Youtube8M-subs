00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
do it now as I mean we could have

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.600

started<00:01:47.850> earlier<00:01:48.119> but<00:01:49.190> never<00:01:50.190> too<00:01:50.399> late<00:01:50.429> to

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
started earlier but never too late to

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.940 
started earlier but never too late to
become<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.299> team<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:52.140> mean<00:01:52.530> we're<00:01:52.709> not<00:01:52.799> about

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
become a team and I mean we're not about

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.529 
become a team and I mean we're not about
to<00:01:53.009> buy<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.700> glow<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.000> tournament<00:01:54.390> time

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
to buy the glow in the tournament time

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:56.270 
to buy the glow in the tournament time
so<00:01:54.750> that's<00:01:54.929> the<00:01:55.020> best<00:01:55.170> time<00:01:55.289> to<00:01:55.560> have<00:01:55.649> him<00:01:55.860> as<00:01:56.220> a

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
so that's the best time to have him as a

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.320 
so that's the best time to have him as a
team<00:01:56.689> now<00:01:57.689> with<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.709> 47<00:01:59.429> points<00:01:59.610> which
