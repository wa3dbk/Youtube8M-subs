00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
game the multiplayer is not really

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.860 
game the multiplayer is not really
really<00:00:39.629> bad<00:00:39.840> but<00:00:40.710> it's<00:00:41.070> pretty<00:00:41.910> annoying<00:00:42.600> it

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
really bad but it's pretty annoying it

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.100 
really bad but it's pretty annoying it
has<00:00:43.050> more<00:00:43.320> downs<00:00:43.680> than<00:00:43.920> ups<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.640> if<00:00:45.480> i<00:00:45.750> was<00:00:46.079> to

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
has more downs than ups and if i was to

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.979 
has more downs than ups and if i was to
rate<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:46.829> game<00:00:47.129> out<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.550> 10<00:00:48.030> i<00:00:48.300> will<00:00:48.719> probably

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
rate this game out of 10 i will probably

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.520 
rate this game out of 10 i will probably
give<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.559> 10<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:51.020> reason<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.230> because

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
give it a 10 and reason is because

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.520 
give it a 10 and reason is because
they've<00:00:52.980> added<00:00:53.309> so<00:00:53.640> much<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.149> story<00:00:54.530> that

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
they've added so much of a story that

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.979 
they've added so much of a story that
it's<00:00:55.710> cory's<00:00:56.280> more<00:00:56.579> easter<00:00:57.000> eggs<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.660> they've

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
it's cory's more easter eggs and they've

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.930 
it's cory's more easter eggs and they've
been<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.530> creative<00:00:59.160> when<00:00:59.340> they<00:00:59.460> created<00:00:59.820> this

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
been so creative when they created this

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.090 
been so creative when they created this
so<00:01:00.750> now<00:01:01.020> i'm<00:01:01.170> just<00:01:01.199> gonna<00:01:01.440> tell<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.800> about<00:01:01.890> the

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
behind it on transit you do build your

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.429 
behind it on transit you do build your
own<00:01:43.950> weapons<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.729> just<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.689> talk<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.079> you

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
own weapons and just to talk and you

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.990 
own weapons and just to talk and you
talk<00:01:46.470> about<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:47.040> Wonder<00:01:47.399> weapon<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.850> black

talk about the Wonder weapon and black

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.770 
talk about the Wonder weapon and black
ops<00:01:48.210> 2<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:49.439> do<00:01:49.740> think<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.430> on<00:01:50.579> transit<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.420> should

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
ops 2 I do think it on transit it should

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.899 
ops 2 I do think it on transit it should
probably<00:01:51.960> be<00:01:52.200> on<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:53.130> do<00:01:53.189> think<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.880> have

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
probably be on and I do think you have

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.200 
probably be on and I do think you have
to<00:01:54.360> build<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.689> Wonder<00:01:55.110> weapon<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:56.880> other

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
to build the Wonder weapon the other

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.420 
to build the Wonder weapon the other
game<00:01:57.509> mode<00:01:57.750> is<00:01:58.049> survival<00:01:58.649> where<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.159> stay<00:01:59.399> on

but<00:02:21.990> I<00:02:22.260> do<00:02:22.800> prefer<00:02:22.920> transit<00:02:23.580> because<00:02:23.790> you're

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
but I do prefer transit because you're

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.150 
but I do prefer transit because you're
getting<00:02:24.210> more<00:02:24.450> of<00:02:24.570> a<00:02:24.660> move<00:02:24.900> on<00:02:25.140> more<00:02:25.860> gameplay

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
getting more of a move on more gameplay

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.880 
getting more of a move on more gameplay
and<00:02:27.320> more<00:02:28.320> action<00:02:28.500> really<00:02:29.870> but<00:02:30.870> on<00:02:31.140> transit

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
and more action really but on transit

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.190 
and more action really but on transit
transit<00:02:32.130> is<00:02:32.460> way<00:02:32.910> bigger<00:02:33.210> because<00:02:33.510> you<00:02:33.810> do<00:02:33.990> get

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
transit is way bigger because you do get

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.070 
transit is way bigger because you do get
through<00:02:34.910> go<00:02:35.910> through<00:02:35.940> bus<00:02:36.450> stops<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:36.840> stuff

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080
