00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 hi i Brad Lancaster and I am the author of two 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.660
 books collecting rainwater in arid 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.880
 lands volume 1 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.340
 and never guess rain picking 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.320
 water arid lands and not only about 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.820
 2 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.949
 quite easy to help people improve 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.400
 water situation in their 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.260
 areas in accessible ways so that 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.420
 outline present modern 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.369
 situation and the meaning of a simple change 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.349
 which should be produced let's 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:34.829
 take the fleet of aroma baking dish with 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:38.070
 This is what an ordinary landscape looks like. 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.950
 It looks like a child's usual landscape in 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.469
 Western us we used to plant 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:48.420
 trees and other greens on the tops of these 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:50.129
 resembling a grave mound what 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.559
 happens when on such a plot 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.420
 it rains 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.210
 here we have rain and take and 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.649
 spill it 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.899
 here you are right from heaven on earth 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.629
 water free mass collapses 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.260
 the aroma flows and flows flows both already 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.570
 farther 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.090
 wait for a lot of water ran away 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.580
 and most likely you will see what kind of people 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.950
 neighbors wishing in the lowland rest your 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.810
 the plot is still dry this 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.549
 somewhere an hour after the rain 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.130
 will have to enable sprinkler installation 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:24.000
 to restore lost moisture 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.100
 and 2 artificial watering is superfluous 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.950
 electricity costs because 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:35.189
 pumps pump water for miles 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:37.079
 last as well as it requires us 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:41.070
 senses turn our form to 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:43.140
 baking the right side up so 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.600
 way instead of planting on 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.060
 vertices in the old fashioned way we put 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.759
 plant near and then inside the groove in 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.240
 earth he goes there some water is sung 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:57.509
 and works on all now happens too 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.119
 during the rain starts brought out and 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.250
 begins to fill our groove by 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.280
 our baking dish then 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.180
 someday 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:10.119
 he either continues to flow fear us 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:13.450
 the plot goes already unnecessary surplus they 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:16.180
 all the water a battle of the sith is understandable 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.550
 still a long time after the spirit 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.040
 cease to call from the sky all these rolls 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.069
 all these grooves in the ground will be full 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.560
 water and both fuaro she from water will 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.140
 soak into the ground to go and not run away 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.500
 on someone else's plot causing neighbors garbage 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.230
 at 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.069
 do you see the earth like the buns up 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.340
 permeable 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:39.310
 its on what no later than 12 hours 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.830
 hot water will not stay if your 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.440
 bakeware planted with plants all 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.360
 no residue is considered so don't be afraid 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.730
 problems with mosquitoes on the contrary you 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.890
 get rid of this problem because you are not 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.680
 give her the opportunity to accumulate for a long time 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.840
 in a puddle forcing her to penetrate faster 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.880
 earth vegetation turn into live 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.400
 la suisse which will provide you with water in 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.269
 fruits like nice cool shade big 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.030
 launcher 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:06.269
 she according to god i am now also a universe 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.030
 wind and soil erosion protection 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:12.070
 natural habitat for wild 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.260
 similar would still develop my if i 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.440
 turn to another example that i have 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.620
 I have a plot model here 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.200
 an area of four four and a half 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.420
 Satka reduced in scale and on 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.590
 about a hundred houses 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:34.120
 square meters of nipples what with similar 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.980
 part and it seems during the rain already 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.640
 the rain story we know 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.650
 just flowing away with hearing about 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.910
 what can rain water be collected about 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.750
 this free sources 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:04:05.739
 high quality water falling from the sky 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:04:08.519
 people think we will not reach the tank that 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.519
 now will be 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:17.280
 true idea that 's where we lost 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.009
 a lot of water that is ticking clambering along 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:25.650
 District she you this he after all this already 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:30.389
 progress because we see me 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:33.090
 better out of thousands 400 to 400 liters 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:34.680
 month Warren album did not disappear, they 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.919
 stayed with us on the site 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.729
 yes, but what about the water that 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.789
 We lost 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:44.210
 the water that has flowed around this 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:47.220
 too often overlooked correctly 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.530
 people get stuck on tanks and roofs 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.380
 raise but we can save where 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:55.650
 more water right in the soil plot 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:05:00.360
 if only he made everything so land 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:03.570
 held and kept this water easily 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:06.300
 Well, create a class for what you need sponge 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:10.050
 the form of a wet green recess in 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:14.250
 earth now let's put a sponge 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:17.400
 and I have a chance here at hand 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:20.159
 proved to be the truth of their place nor on earth 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:24.419
 growth and inside a recess in shape for 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:27.020
 baking but the basic gist is not changed sau 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:27.020
 and vologda
