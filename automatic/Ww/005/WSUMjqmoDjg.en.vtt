one<00:00:13.130> little<00:00:13.280> trick<00:00:13.519> that<00:00:13.760> a<00:00:13.790> lot<00:00:14.059> of<00:00:14.210> blues

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:14.509 
one little trick that a lot of blues

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:16.500 
one little trick that a lot of blues
guitar<00:00:14.929> players<00:00:15.200> eventually<00:00:15.469> tend<00:00:15.860> to<00:00:15.920> use<00:00:16.100> is

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:16.510 
guitar players eventually tend to use is

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.940 
guitar players eventually tend to use is
what<00:00:17.510> I'm<00:00:17.599> going<00:00:17.720> to<00:00:17.750> refer<00:00:17.990> to<00:00:18.170> as<00:00:18.289> two<00:00:18.590> string

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:18.950 
what I'm going to refer to as two string

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.700 
what I'm going to refer to as two string
release<00:00:19.369> bends<00:00:19.849> and<00:00:20.320> it<00:00:21.320> sounds<00:00:21.590> something

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
release bends and it sounds something

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.870 
release bends and it sounds something
like<00:00:21.800> this

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.690 

the<00:00:26.419> idea<00:00:26.720> is<00:00:26.840> that<00:00:26.930> I'm<00:00:27.919> bending<00:00:28.460> in<00:00:28.579> this

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:28.700 
the idea is that I'm bending in this

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.010 
the idea is that I'm bending in this
case<00:00:28.880> the<00:00:29.059> eighth<00:00:29.180> fret<00:00:29.450> on<00:00:29.570> the<00:00:29.660> second

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:30.020 
case the eighth fret on the second

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.100 
case the eighth fret on the second
string<00:00:30.489> up<00:00:31.489> a<00:00:31.669> whole-step<00:00:31.880> holding<00:00:32.840> that<00:00:32.960> up

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
string up a whole-step holding that up

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.930 
string up a whole-step holding that up
and<00:00:33.680> you<00:00:33.800> can<00:00:33.920> see<00:00:34.070> my<00:00:34.190> third<00:00:34.430> fingers<00:00:34.760> just

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
and you can see my third fingers just

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.569 
and you can see my third fingers just
barely<00:00:35.590> going<00:00:36.590> over<00:00:36.950> the<00:00:37.070> third<00:00:37.370> string<00:00:39.579> so

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
barely going over the third string so

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.330 
barely going over the third string so
I'm<00:00:40.670> holding<00:00:41.059> the<00:00:41.149> note<00:00:41.329> up<00:00:42.040> when<00:00:43.040> I<00:00:43.100> picked

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
I'm holding the note up when I picked

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.650 
I'm holding the note up when I picked
the<00:00:43.430> second<00:00:43.730> string<00:00:43.879> I'm<00:00:44.000> going<00:00:44.030> to<00:00:44.239> pick<00:00:44.450> the

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
the second string I'm going to pick the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.439 
the second string I'm going to pick the
third<00:00:44.960> string<00:00:45.320> on<00:00:45.649> the<00:00:46.429> way<00:00:46.550> down<00:00:46.820> so<00:00:47.179> you<00:00:47.300> kind

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:47.449 
third string on the way down so you kind

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:51.020 
third string on the way down so you kind
of<00:00:47.480> get<00:00:47.570> this

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.570 

combined<00:00:51.990> sound<00:00:52.380> between<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.800> two<00:00:52.950> notes<00:00:53.190> and

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:53.580 
combined sound between the two notes and

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.000 
combined sound between the two notes and
of<00:00:54.450> course<00:00:55.140> that's<00:00:55.260> written<00:00:55.560> out<00:00:55.620> on<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.800> tab

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
of course that's written out on the tab

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.200 
of course that's written out on the tab
of<00:00:56.190> string<00:00:56.430> bending<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.850> something<00:00:57.090> that's

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
of string bending is something that's

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.910 
of string bending is something that's
new<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.690> definitely<00:00:57.810> refer<00:00:58.470> you<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.620> the

into<00:01:04.320> this<00:01:04.470> but<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.640> lot<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.090> guys<00:01:06.180> like<00:01:06.210> jimi

into this but a lot of guys like jimi

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.719 
into this but a lot of guys like jimi
hendrix<00:01:06.930> use<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:07.590> pretty<00:01:07.860> extensively<00:01:08.010> so

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
hendrix use this pretty extensively so

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.010 
hendrix use this pretty extensively so
that<00:01:08.880> that's<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.330> first<00:01:09.510> like<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:09.869> would<00:01:09.990> be

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
that that's the first like that would be

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.670 
that that's the first like that would be
over<00:01:10.290> if<00:01:10.830> you're<00:01:10.950> playing<00:01:11.190> in<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.460> basic<00:01:11.910> a<00:01:12.150> box

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
over if you're playing in a basic a box

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.320 
over if you're playing in a basic a box
in<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:14.100> key<00:01:14.220> Bay

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.150 

is<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.170> idea<00:01:19.440> for<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.590> if<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:19.830> were<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.010> take

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
is the idea for that if I were to take

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.490 
is the idea for that if I were to take
that<00:01:20.220> lick<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.300> key<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.480> e<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.990> just<00:01:22.290> move<00:01:22.440> up

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
that lick to the key of e I just move up

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.490 
that lick to the key of e I just move up
to<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.740> 12th<00:01:23.010> position<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.550> e<00:01:23.580> box

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:34.370 

so<00:01:28.500> that's<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.770> first<00:01:28.950> lick<00:01:29.250> again<00:01:29.580> in<00:01:29.850> a

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.530 

many

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.620 

and<00:01:39.410> again<00:01:39.710> the<00:01:39.860> trick<00:01:40.100> there<00:01:40.460> to<00:01:41.180> do<00:01:41.510> it

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
and again the trick there to do it

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.200 
and again the trick there to do it
slowly<00:01:41.870> is<00:01:42.710> to<00:01:42.950> really<00:01:43.190> watch<00:01:43.370> your<00:01:43.700> your

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
slowly is to really watch your your

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.820 
slowly is to really watch your your
third<00:01:44.480> finger<00:01:44.750> as<00:01:44.990> you're<00:01:45.110> bending<00:01:45.320> that<00:01:45.620> up<00:01:45.710> a

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
third finger as you're bending that up a

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.520 
third finger as you're bending that up a
whole-step<00:01:46.720> see<00:01:47.720> I'm<00:01:47.840> going<00:01:48.080> for<00:01:48.230> the<00:01:48.320> third

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
whole-step see I'm going for the third

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.160 
whole-step see I'm going for the third
string<00:01:48.860> as<00:01:49.010> well<00:01:49.720> so<00:01:50.720> when<00:01:50.840> I<00:01:50.870> bring<00:01:51.020> it<00:01:51.140> down

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
string as well so when I bring it down

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.450 
string as well so when I bring it down
you<00:01:51.410> here<00:01:51.530> are<00:01:51.620> the<00:01:51.680> third<00:01:51.890> and<00:01:52.070> the<00:01:52.130> second

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
you here are the third and the second

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.390 
you here are the third and the second
ringing<00:01:52.640> together

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.710 

and<00:01:55.610> of<00:01:55.850> course<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.180> pitch<00:01:56.390> that<00:01:56.420> you're

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
and of course the pitch that you're

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.060 
and of course the pitch that you're
bending<00:01:57.020> up<00:01:57.110> to<00:01:57.230> on<00:01:57.320> the<00:01:57.380> second<00:01:57.710> string<00:01:57.920> is

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
bending up to on the second string is

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.400 
bending up to on the second string is
really<00:01:58.250> G<00:01:58.880> to<00:01:59.060> an<00:01:59.150> a<00:01:59.360> it's<00:01:59.600> a<00:01:59.720> real<00:01:59.930> definite

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
really G to an a it's a real definite

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.760 
really G to an a it's a real definite
pitch<00:02:01.720> sort<00:02:02.720> of<00:02:02.780> legitimate<00:02:03.140> pitch<00:02:03.500> there

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
pitch sort of legitimate pitch there

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.490 
pitch sort of legitimate pitch there
when<00:02:04.280> you're<00:02:04.460> when<00:02:04.970> you're<00:02:05.000> bending<00:02:05.390> off<00:02:06.140> the

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
when you're when you're bending off the

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.660 
when you're when you're bending off the
third<00:02:06.710> string<00:02:06.920> what's<00:02:07.100> really<00:02:07.340> cool<00:02:07.580> about

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
third string what's really cool about

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.400 
third string what's really cool about
that<00:02:07.820> is<00:02:08.000> that<00:02:08.240> you're<00:02:08.390> you're<00:02:08.869> on<00:02:08.990> a<00:02:09.020> semitone

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
that is that you're you're on a semitone

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.350 
that is that you're you're on a semitone
you're<00:02:09.800> on<00:02:09.890> a<00:02:09.920> note<00:02:10.160> that<00:02:10.400> well<00:02:11.210> it's<00:02:11.330> just

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
you're on a note that well it's just

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.620 
you're on a note that well it's just
between<00:02:11.750> two<00:02:12.580> regular<00:02:13.580> notes<00:02:13.760> you<00:02:14.240> find<00:02:14.480> the

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
between two regular notes you find the

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.870 
between two regular notes you find the
12<00:02:14.780> half-step<00:02:15.260> system<00:02:15.560> so<00:02:15.650> you

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
there which is obviously always a good

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:29.740 
there which is obviously always a good
thing<00:02:22.700> with<00:02:22.790> blues<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.830> again<00:02:24.830> Annie<00:02:28.630> so<00:02:29.630> then

thing with blues and again Annie so then

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.410 
thing with blues and again Annie so then
the<00:02:29.840> second<00:02:30.230> lick<00:02:30.410> I<00:02:31.130> do<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:32.000> same<00:02:32.150> idea<00:02:32.270> but

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420

I'm<00:02:32.570> gonna<00:02:32.750> bend<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:33.080> first<00:02:33.350> string<00:02:33.680> up<00:02:33.950> so<00:02:34.730> it

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
I'm gonna bend the first string up so it

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:41.470

would<00:02:35.060> sound<00:02:35.240> something<00:02:35.330> like<00:02:35.480> this<00:02:39.640> and<00:02:40.640> that

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
would sound something like this and that

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:48.660 
would sound something like this and that
that<00:02:41.870> is<00:02:41.990> also<00:02:42.140> in<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:42.380> key<00:02:42.560> of<00:02:42.650> a
