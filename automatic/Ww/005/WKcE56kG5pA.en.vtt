that<00:00:21.359> had<00:00:21.570> rolled<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:22.080> guess<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.529> we<00:00:22.680> wanted<00:00:23.010> to

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
that had rolled I guess and we wanted to

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.250 
that had rolled I guess and we wanted to
run<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:23.550> because<00:00:23.699> usually<00:00:24.150> they<00:00:24.449> have<00:00:24.480> oil<00:00:24.930> and

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
run it because usually they have oil and

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.990 
run it because usually they have oil and
places<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:26.010> doesn't<00:00:26.039> belong<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:26.939> it

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
places that it doesn't belong and it

places that it doesn't belong and it
smokes<00:00:27.300> for<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.599> little<00:00:27.810> bit<00:00:27.960> which<00:00:28.170> this

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
smokes for a little bit which this

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.370 
smokes for a little bit which this
engine<00:00:29.160> did<00:00:29.369> do<00:00:29.580> there's<00:00:30.570> still<00:00:30.810> some<00:00:30.990> surface

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
engine did do there's still some surface

engine did do there's still some surface
oil<00:00:31.590> on<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.070> outside<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.759> engine<00:00:33.059> that

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
oil on the outside of the engine that

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.850 
oil on the outside of the engine that
maybe<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.540> can<00:00:33.690> see<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.930> little<00:00:34.140> oil<00:00:34.350> vapors

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
maybe you can see the little oil vapors

maybe you can see the little oil vapors
coming<00:00:35.130> up<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.370> off<00:00:35.460> but<00:00:35.790> we<00:00:36.180> just<00:00:36.329> warmed<00:00:36.660> it

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
coming up and off but we just warmed it

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.000 
coming up and off but we just warmed it
up<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.050> get<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.230> all<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.410> way<00:00:37.440> up<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.770> temp

great running engine it did throw a

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.760 
great running engine it did throw a
random<00:00:41.520> misfire<00:00:42.120> we<00:00:42.540> would<00:00:42.840> recommend<00:00:43.200> new

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
random misfire we would recommend new

random misfire we would recommend new
plugs<00:00:44.100> for<00:00:44.489> this<00:00:44.670> that's<00:00:45.629> usually<00:00:45.960> what

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
plugs for this that's usually what

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.350

happens the oil fouls the plugs screws
them<00:00:48.570> up<00:00:48.750> we<00:00:49.710> will<00:00:49.920> start<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.340> up<00:00:50.430> here<00:00:50.640> in<00:00:50.700> a

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
them up we will start it up here in a

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.930 
them up we will start it up here in a
minute<00:00:50.879> it's<00:00:51.090> not<00:00:51.180> bad<00:00:51.570> by<00:00:51.870> any<00:00:52.079> means<00:00:52.730> so<00:00:53.730> what

minute it's not bad by any means so what
is<00:00:54.090> this<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.219> ECM<00:00:56.879> is

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
is this this is the that is the ECM is

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.110 
is this this is the that is the ECM is
the<00:00:57.360> PCM<00:00:58.050> right<00:00:58.289> power<00:00:58.590> control<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.820> is<00:01:00.000> the

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
the PCM right power control this is the

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.729 
the PCM right power control this is the
standalone<00:01:00.539> harness<00:01:01.079> that's<00:01:01.230> running<00:01:01.530> this

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
standalone harness that's running this

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.340 
standalone harness that's running this
right<00:01:02.010> now<00:01:02.190> or<00:01:02.370> will<00:01:02.670> be<00:01:02.850> shortly<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.539> then

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
right now or will be shortly and then

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.320 
right now or will be shortly and then
over<00:01:04.769> here<00:01:04.799> what<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.489> hell<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.850> this<00:01:05.970> huge

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
over here what the hell is this huge

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.800 
over here what the hell is this huge
thing<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.310> 6l80<00:01:08.310> six-speed<00:01:09.150> automatic

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
thing this is a 6l80 six-speed automatic

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.539 
thing this is a 6l80 six-speed automatic
transmission<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:10.590> basically<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.310> big

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
transmission so basically the big

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.450 
transmission so basically the big
6-speed<00:01:12.270> brother<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.960> 4<00:01:13.409> l<00:01:13.590> 80<00:01:13.920> what<00:01:14.280> we're

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
6-speed brother of a 4 l 80 what we're

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.789 
6-speed brother of a 4 l 80 what we're
used<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.820> seeing<00:01:15.150> in<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.420> older<00:01:15.900> vehicles<00:01:16.500> yes

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
used to seeing in the older vehicles yes

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:17.749 
used to seeing in the older vehicles yes
okay

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
okay

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.820 
okay
it<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.210> fly-by-wire<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:18.960> see<00:01:19.350> we<00:01:19.470> have<00:01:19.500> that

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
it is fly-by-wire I see we have that

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.210 
it is fly-by-wire I see we have that
hooked<00:01:20.100> up<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.960> why<00:01:21.960> don't<00:01:22.200> we<00:01:22.259> flick<00:01:23.070> the

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
hooked up so why don't we flick the

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:30.640 
hooked up so why don't we flick the
switch<00:01:25.400> here<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.490> pump

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.700 

okay<00:01:31.300> what<00:01:32.300> we're<00:01:32.480> seeing<00:01:32.750> here

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
okay what we're seeing here

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:43.429 
okay what we're seeing here
to<00:01:35.250> nurse<00:01:35.430> starts<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.909> scan<00:01:36.180> it

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.080 

kind<00:01:43.859> of<00:01:43.950> tough<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.159> depress<00:01:44.579> this<00:01:44.820> into<00:01:45.060> a

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
kind of tough to depress this into a

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.059 
kind of tough to depress this into a
video<00:01:45.390> at<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.600> same<00:01:45.810> time<00:01:46.049> but<00:01:46.350> basically

00:01:47.059 --> 00:01:47.069 
video at the same time but basically

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:49.099 
video at the same time but basically
what<00:01:47.340> we're<00:01:47.520> seeing<00:01:47.789> is<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.390> engine<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:48.929> up

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:49.109 
what we're seeing is the engine is up

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:53.230 
what we're seeing is the engine is up
and<00:01:49.350> running<00:01:49.740> let's<00:01:50.270> see<00:01:51.270> if<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.569> can<00:01:51.869> do<00:01:52.079> this

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
and running let's see if I can do this

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.910 
and running let's see if I can do this
let's<00:01:54.240> see<00:01:54.539> scan<00:01:56.810> stop<00:01:57.810> scanning<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.799> then

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
let's see scan stop scanning and then

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:06.160 
let's see scan stop scanning and then
we're<00:01:59.100> going<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.340> want<00:01:59.729> it<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.179> scan

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.900 

okay<00:02:07.170> let's<00:02:07.500> see<00:02:07.710> if<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:08.009> is<00:02:08.039> throwing<00:02:08.729> the

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
okay let's see if it is throwing the
