00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:05.270
 Hello and welcome to a new tutorial by Mister Orfeo 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.400
 Rio you see it already is about objective 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.570
 This tutorial is designed as a beginner's tutorial and is a wish 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.870
 Tutorial of a one subscriber 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.870
 heartfelt thanks at this point 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:21.529
 focal lengths 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:23.259
 are the key to 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:26.899
 Euro distinctive series within the OPEC the families 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.610
 we differentiate between wide-angle lenses in one 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.010
 Focal length range of 15 to 35 millimeters 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.130
 normally objective 45 to 60 millimeters 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.969
 and many lenses from 75 to 1,800 millimeters, with one already here 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.109
 Restriction exists or a distinction once again within the 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:48.230
 target area 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.230
 between easy bunch Sopot marriages 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.550
 why the different focal lengths 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.929
 because we cover different picture cases 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.809
 So imagine you want to record a landscape and 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.270
 the dread deep 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.360
 ready 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.509
 you would in this case a wide-angle lens 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:12.540
 use 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.450
 So that's how it turns out somewhere 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.460
 far less objective on it 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.689
 and there is a lot of landscape left and right on Brown's photo 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.310
 the objective again corresponds approximately to the human soul 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.500
 that means with a 50 millimeter lens 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.410
 would you 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.490
 with the principle that the picture gets what the eye perceives soon 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.540
 Telephoto lenses on the other hand correspond 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.230
 about or you can say the lenses are like binoculars 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.240
 So I can do relatively distant things 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.210
 Herrmann 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.520
 Spar and 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.520
 formatfÃ¼llend 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.549
 but respect what has just been told applies 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.259
 Small format cameras Paso analog film cameras or 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.259
 SLR cameras with full format sensor 

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:14.480
 Usually you do not have that but because of cost reasons 

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:19.719
 Many people resort to a downsized sensor that appeals to Dante 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:22.079
 an extension cable gate 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:26.619
 if you and Georg Georg would have manual or camera 

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:28.109
 take one 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:31.249
 Extension negotiations also roughly called Factor 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.209
 must take into account 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:40.280
 It may be that your objective is no longer what the on the 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.649
 objective is printed 

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:46.319
 For example, if you have an extension cord of 1 point sex 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.759
 as said, has new instructions for use of the camera and has 

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:52.009
 a 50 mm lens 

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:55.239
 then it would change due to the changes 

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:59.959
 a the given as if you had an 80 millimeter lens 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:01.959
 from Bavaria 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.239
 the normal lens would not be an easy target 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.799
 always remember 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:13.349
 the extension spark gate on cameras that do not match full-frame sensor before 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:22.819
 yes, which beginner would not have wondered about the one way 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.229
 cryptic details on the bucket AKTIF 

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:30.499
 which means, for example, 1 colon 3com a5 

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:32.019
 - 4 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.019
 Slash 21 - 35 

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:39.169
 The whole thing is half so bad 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:43.599
 We are happy that in detail we have two plants here 

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:48.339
 and the one after the other at 21 to 35 millimeters 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:54.199
 what does that tell us here with a variable focal length range 

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:56.699
 so-called zoom lens have to do 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:04:01.659
 In this case, it is a long way to go deep in the two areas 21 to 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:03.489
 35 millimeters 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.309
 since then probably all zoom lenses 

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:09.789
 you can push them back and forth, and as you like 

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:12.430
 which extract you choose changes 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.049
 an automatic also the focal length as opposed to a fixed focal length 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.440
 the IEC can not change so in our example 21 until the 30th 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.120
 millimeter 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.439
 Scapegoat AKTIF 

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:27.029
 the second plant 1 

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:28.850
 Colon 3com on 5 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.210
 - 4 sounds like the group beaten as it actually is 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.879
 depending on the excerpt of the selected focal length varies the maximum aperture 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:41.789
 one speaks here also of an initially volumes 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:43.879
 between three comma 5 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:46.879
 four municipalities 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.340
 the larger the initial Brendel the lower the depth of field 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.100
 that means that it is very nice when it comes to so-called time off 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:05:00.159
 to be able to have a shallow depth of field that is the largest possible aperture 

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:02.210
 to choose 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.210
 and that you are stronger objectively 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.580
 that means you can work with lower shutter speeds 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.780
 if you make a poem more objectively it decreases the danger 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.580
 from blurred 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:19.550
 so 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.120
 shot the whole thing in practice again 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.830
 I have now objectively put on my camera and her body already 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.950
 recognize it is an objective with an initial load of two 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:32.170
 Comma 8 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:33.159
 a relative 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:35.070
 bright lens 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.449
 and it's a fixed focal length 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:41.569
 with hundreds of helpers that is to say it is an easy pull 

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:46.869
 szo front we have now synonymous details on the lens 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:50.099
 Here we form 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:51.490
 so that means 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.009
 I could mean mine here 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:57.610
 Indicated looting formed in the displayed and so it must be right 

00:05:58.309 --> 00:06:02.889
 and what that means to you, I will explain to you 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:06.849
 Up here, the tenants have information on top of that are persistently large 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:08.240
 Interest and silver 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.569
 Peter takes care of that more 

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:15.009
 I can recognize myself with this scale 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:19.480
 in which areas a photo of Schaar is displayed 

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.700
 he says 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.509
 very good thing 

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:27.779
 so I am offering now I the ILA my blender with which I photograph 

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:30.650
 I would like to have my plans 11 chosen here 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.650
 and now place Hach 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:37.800
 the granny out of it 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.129
 if we had that setting we would have a sharp AFP photo through the 

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:45.259
 Seeker cooked and it looks like that and now I can go off 

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:47.270
 read in which area 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:52.020
 my photo is sharply displayed and although I have the blind 11 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.820
 chosen 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.900
 and now I can lay in it while looking up over where do I find the 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.699
 chosen because of the elf's here 

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:02.729
 on the other hand are also off the market 

00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:07.860
 and now if I look up from Blender 11 and here too complete eleven 

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:08.770
 up 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.630
 I can read exactly 

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.759
 my photo taz in a field sharp 

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:15.819
 between 4 

00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:20.659
 and after his six meters so that's he sharp area 

00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:27.469
 Distance to the camera 4 to 6 meters in the area in this case sharp on object 

00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:30.900
 be imaged everything that lies in front or behind it 

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.610
 Chairman and Sharpness 

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:34.759
 the good thing 

00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:36.969
 Unfortunately, and have an objective 

00:07:36.969 --> 00:07:40.760
 I can not spend a lot of money on this 

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.999
 but still finds it all that objectively 

00:07:43.999 --> 00:07:46.560
 or even the small change 

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:51.020
 then the German this certainly came with a bit more security 

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:52.759
 give a photograph 

00:07:52.759 --> 00:07:57.720
 as soon as this video has been liked write offers comments but i do not 

00:07:57.719 --> 00:07:59.740
 Favors because videos 

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.589
 I'm looking forward to the TAK 

00:08:01.589 --> 00:08:05.439
 and for the good this has allowed 8 o'clock this year
