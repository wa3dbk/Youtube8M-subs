showing<00:00:07.069> people<00:00:08.069> how<00:00:08.309> to<00:00:08.340> print<00:00:08.940> the

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
showing people how to print the

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.450 
showing people how to print the
old-fashioned<00:00:09.690> way<00:00:09.719> I<00:00:10.190> think<00:00:11.190> it's<00:00:11.280> really

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
old-fashioned way I think it's really

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.430 
old-fashioned way I think it's really
fun<00:00:11.730> first<00:00:12.120> of<00:00:12.240> all<00:00:12.330> it<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:12.690> just<00:00:13.080> be<00:00:13.139> able<00:00:13.320> to

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
fun first of all it to just be able to

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.550 
fun first of all it to just be able to
work<00:00:13.590> with<00:00:13.740> your<00:00:13.830> hands<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.750> and<00:00:15.750> then<00:00:16.350> have

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
work with your hands and and then have

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.140 
work with your hands and and then have
the<00:00:16.680> satisfaction<00:00:16.920> of<00:00:17.430> walking<00:00:17.760> away<00:00:17.880> with

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
the satisfaction of walking away with

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.150 
the satisfaction of walking away with
something<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:18.449> just<00:00:18.630> made<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.199> I<00:00:19.830> think<00:00:20.039> it's

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
something you just made and I think it's

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.640 
something you just made and I think it's
a<00:00:20.369> really<00:00:20.520> physical<00:00:21.180> type<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:21.990> printing<00:00:22.380> which

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
a really physical type of printing which

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.310 
a really physical type of printing which
you<00:00:23.460> know<00:00:23.580> with<00:00:23.789> everyone<00:00:24.660> using<00:00:24.869> computers

that<00:00:28.560> physical<00:00:29.490> tangible<00:00:29.820> quality<00:00:30.510> of<00:00:30.720> making

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
that physical tangible quality of making

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.389 
that physical tangible quality of making
something<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:32.960> started<00:00:33.960> last<00:00:34.140> summer<00:00:34.620> just
