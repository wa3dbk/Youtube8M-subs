the<00:04:06.730> natural<00:04:07.420> well<00:04:08.260> I<00:04:08.290> think<00:04:08.410> concept<00:04:09.250> but

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
the natural well I think concept but

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.400 
the natural well I think concept but
this<00:04:09.519> this<00:04:09.790> is<00:04:09.940> a<00:04:09.970> very<00:04:10.269> very<00:04:10.450> similar<00:04:10.780> actual

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.860 
this this is a very very similar actual
eye<00:04:11.530> color<00:04:11.829> and<00:04:12.519> so<00:04:12.940> I<00:04:12.970> think<00:04:13.180> you<00:04:13.480> can<00:04:13.660> play

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
eye color and so I think you can play

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.660 
eye color and so I think you can play
around<00:04:14.019> with<00:04:14.380> colors<00:04:14.829> which<00:04:14.980> are<00:04:15.130> around<00:04:15.400> your

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
around with colors which are around your

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.430 
around with colors which are around your
eye<00:04:15.700> color<00:04:16.000> it's<00:04:16.359> kind<00:04:16.630> of<00:04:16.720> like<00:04:16.930> your<00:04:17.139> skin

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
eye color it's kind of like your skin

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.349 
eye color it's kind of like your skin
but<00:04:17.590> much<00:04:17.829> more<00:04:18.100> like<00:04:18.280> a<00:04:18.310> hyper<00:04:18.609> real<00:04:18.910> version

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
but much more like a hyper real version

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:20.620
