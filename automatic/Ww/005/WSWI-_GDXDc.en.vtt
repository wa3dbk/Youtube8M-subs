it's uh you know if you enjoy watching a

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.750 
it's uh you know if you enjoy watching a
rad<00:02:39.800> research<00:02:40.330> that<00:02:41.330> could<00:02:41.540> be<00:02:41.690> pretty<00:02:41.900> fun

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760

rad research that could be pretty fun
and<00:02:43.760> then<00:02:44.210> it's<00:02:44.840> probably<00:02:45.200> faster<00:02:45.620> than

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
and then it's probably faster than

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.770 
and then it's probably faster than
anything<00:02:46.370> you<00:02:46.459> have<00:02:46.490> now<00:02:47.120> if<00:02:47.480> you're<00:02:47.630> just

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
anything super fancy it's like it's this

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.110 
anything super fancy it's like it's this
incredible<00:03:23.180> deal<00:03:23.540> I<00:03:24.470> personally<00:03:25.190> prefer

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
incredible deal I personally prefer

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.240 
incredible deal I personally prefer
something<00:03:26.570> that<00:03:26.780> can<00:03:26.930> do<00:03:27.049> two<00:03:27.530> batteries<00:03:28.100> at<00:03:28.220> a

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
something that can do two batteries at a

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.509 
something that can do two batteries at a
time<00:03:28.519> one<00:03:29.269> is<00:03:29.480> just<00:03:29.890> it's<00:03:30.890> it's<00:03:31.130> not<00:03:31.340> very

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
time one is just it's it's not very

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.360 
time one is just it's it's not very
convenient<00:03:32.330> if<00:03:32.720> your<00:03:33.230> power<00:03:33.590> to<00:03:33.739> like

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
convenient if your power to like

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.640 
convenient if your power to like
parallel<00:03:34.760> charge<00:03:35.030> right<00:03:35.360> one<00:03:35.600> at<00:03:35.720> a<00:03:35.810> time<00:03:36.019> yeah

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
parallel charge right one at a time yeah

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.740 
parallel charge right one at a time yeah
if<00:03:36.769> you're<00:03:36.920> out<00:03:37.070> there<00:03:37.330> you're<00:03:38.330> burning<00:03:38.630> off

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
if you're out there you're burning off

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.229 
if you're out there you're burning off
5,000<00:03:39.380> milliamp<00:03:39.790> batteries<00:03:40.790> at<00:03:40.910> the<00:03:41.000> track

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
5,000 milliamp batteries at the track

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:42.729 
5,000 milliamp batteries at the track
you're<00:03:41.480> burning<00:03:41.780> them<00:03:41.870> up<00:03:41.989> every<00:03:42.140> 20<00:03:42.410> minutes

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
you're burning them up every 20 minutes

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.520 
you're burning them up every 20 minutes
so<00:03:43.580> if<00:03:43.910> it<00:03:44.060> takes<00:03:44.090> an<00:03:44.390> hour<00:03:44.540> to<00:03:44.720> get<00:03:44.959> 20<00:03:45.260> minutes

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
so if it takes an hour to get 20 minutes

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:46.930 
so if it takes an hour to get 20 minutes
charge<00:03:45.830> you're<00:03:46.280> going<00:03:46.400> to<00:03:46.459> always<00:03:46.580> be<00:03:46.700> behind

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
charge you're going to always be behind

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.960 
charge you're going to always be behind
so<00:03:47.750> you<00:03:48.320> have<00:03:48.440> to<00:03:48.560> bring<00:03:48.680> three<00:03:49.100> basically

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
so you have to bring three basically

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.580 
so you have to bring three basically
three<00:03:50.330> fully<00:03:50.570> charged<00:03:50.959> five<00:03:51.290> thousand

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
three fully charged five thousand

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.100 
three fully charged five thousand
milliamp<00:03:51.890> batteries<00:03:52.340> to<00:03:52.880> keep<00:03:53.120> one<00:03:53.450> fresh

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
milliamp batteries to keep one fresh

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.870 
milliamp batteries to keep one fresh
yeah<00:03:54.620> you're<00:03:54.890> either<00:03:55.010> invest<00:03:55.340> your<00:03:55.519> money<00:03:55.580> and

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
yeah you're either invest your money and

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.670 
yeah you're either invest your money and
do<00:03:55.940> a<00:03:55.970> ton<00:03:56.180> of<00:03:56.209> batteries<00:03:56.660> or<00:03:56.840> a<00:03:56.900> charger<00:03:57.500> that

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
do a ton of batteries or a charger that

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.470 
do a ton of batteries or a charger that
can<00:03:57.830> charge<00:03:58.130> them<00:03:58.280> so<00:03:58.459> fast<00:03:58.700> or<00:03:58.970> multiples<00:03:59.360> at

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
can charge them so fast or multiples at

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.580 
can charge them so fast or multiples at
a<00:03:59.540> time<00:03:59.720> that<00:03:59.870> you<00:03:59.930> only<00:04:00.080> need<00:04:00.260> one<00:04:00.440> or<00:04:00.560> two

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
a time that you only need one or two

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.500 
a time that you only need one or two
batters<00:04:01.070> yeah<00:04:01.340> and<00:04:01.670> that's<00:04:01.970> a<00:04:02.090> good<00:04:02.239> that's<00:04:02.269> a

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
batters yeah and that's a good that's a

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.180 
batters yeah and that's a good that's a
good<00:04:02.570> point<00:04:02.750> people<00:04:02.989> often<00:04:03.590> overlook<00:04:03.769> that

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
good point people often overlook that

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.770 
good point people often overlook that
it's<00:04:04.340> like<00:04:04.459> how<00:04:04.610> many<00:04:04.790> 50<00:04:05.060> our<00:04:05.239> batteries<00:04:05.630> do

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
it's like how many 50 our batteries do

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.360 
it's like how many 50 our batteries do
you<00:04:05.840> want<00:04:05.989> to<00:04:06.049> buy<00:04:06.170> or<00:04:06.650> you<00:04:06.920> spend<00:04:07.010> the<00:04:07.190> money

on a nice charger that you can get the

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.860 
on a nice charger that you can get the
battery<00:04:09.590> charged<00:04:09.830> in<00:04:09.980> an<00:04:10.100> hour<00:04:10.220> or<00:04:10.600> 20<00:04:11.600> minutes

30 minutes things like that and as they

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.280 
30 minutes things like that and as they
push<00:04:13.760> see<00:04:14.150> ratings<00:04:14.360> of<00:04:14.600> batteries<00:04:15.049> we're

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
push see ratings of batteries we're

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.060 
push see ratings of batteries we're
getting<00:04:15.440> to<00:04:15.500> the<00:04:15.560> point<00:04:15.739> where<00:04:15.950> you're<00:04:16.010> only

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
getting to the point where you're only

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.949 
getting to the point where you're only
waiting<00:04:16.519> a<00:04:16.609> few<00:04:16.760> minutes<00:04:16.820> to<00:04:17.180> charge<00:04:17.390> if<00:04:17.780> you

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
waiting a few minutes to charge if you

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.840 
waiting a few minutes to charge if you
have<00:04:18.049> a<00:04:18.079> powerful<00:04:18.410> not<00:04:18.650> charger<00:04:19.040> this<00:04:19.519> is<00:04:19.700> not

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
have a powerful not charger this is not

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.520 
have a powerful not charger this is not
one<00:04:20.030> that's<00:04:20.180> going<00:04:20.359> to<00:04:20.419> do<00:04:20.570> it<00:04:20.720> yeah<00:04:21.079> this<00:04:21.380> is

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
one that's going to do it yeah this is

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.860 
one that's going to do it yeah this is
your<00:04:21.739> run-of-the-mill<00:04:22.610> entry-level<00:04:23.150> do<00:04:23.750> it

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
your run-of-the-mill entry-level do it

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.420 
your run-of-the-mill entry-level do it
all<00:04:23.990> charter<00:04:24.380> but<00:04:24.919> in<00:04:24.979> terms<00:04:25.130> of<00:04:25.280> performance

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
all charter but in terms of performance

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.300 
all charter but in terms of performance
works<00:04:26.360> great<00:04:26.660> well<00:04:27.169> built<00:04:27.470> things<00:04:28.130> aren't

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
works great well built things aren't

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.040 
works great well built things aren't
falling<00:04:28.580> apart<00:04:29.060> it<00:04:29.270> does<00:04:29.419> exactly<00:04:29.690> what<00:04:29.900> I

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
falling apart it does exactly what I

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.200 
falling apart it does exactly what I
want<00:04:30.200> to<00:04:30.349> do<00:04:30.500> the<00:04:30.979> display<00:04:31.430> is<00:04:31.580> nice<00:04:31.880> it's

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
want to do the display is nice it's

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.370 
want to do the display is nice it's
intuitive

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
intuitive

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.650 
intuitive
so<00:04:33.470> in<00:04:33.650> terms<00:04:33.800> of<00:04:33.980> like<00:04:34.160> that<00:04:34.580> performance<00:04:35.450> it

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
so in terms of like that performance it

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.720 
so in terms of like that performance it
works<00:04:36.050> great<00:04:36.320> it<00:04:36.890> does<00:04:37.130> exactly<00:04:37.400> what<00:04:37.580> it's

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
works great it does exactly what it's

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.250 
works great it does exactly what it's
supposed<00:04:37.760> to<00:04:38.090> yeah<00:04:38.480> Hyperion's<00:04:39.050> a<00:04:39.080> great

figured out later that it just wouldn't

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.270 
figured out later that it just wouldn't
be<00:05:00.200> enough<00:05:00.410> I<00:05:00.590> can't<00:05:00.980> get<00:05:01.070> to<00:05:01.160> the<00:05:01.250> track
