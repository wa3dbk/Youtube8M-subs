we have some good stuff in here so we

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.759 
we have some good stuff in here so we
have<00:02:29.519> a<00:02:29.790> case<00:02:30.239> and<00:02:30.660> let's<00:02:31.139> do<00:02:31.349> the<00:02:31.470> smell<00:02:31.739> test

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
have a case and let's do the smell test

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.729 
have a case and let's do the smell test
see<00:02:32.280> if<00:02:32.340> it's<00:02:32.459> leather<00:02:33.170> good<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.260> see<00:02:34.440> a<00:02:34.470> case

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
see if it's leather good to see a case

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.759 
see if it's leather good to see a case
and<00:02:34.980> this<00:02:35.069> is<00:02:35.220> actually<00:02:35.370> a<00:02:35.730> belt<00:02:36.000> clip<00:02:36.769> you

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
and this is actually a belt clip you

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.949 
and this is actually a belt clip you
remember<00:02:38.099> the<00:02:38.280> touch<00:02:38.970> pro<00:02:39.180> two<00:02:39.269> came<00:02:39.810> with

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
remember the touch pro two came with

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.890 
remember the touch pro two came with
this<00:02:40.200> which<00:02:40.530> is<00:02:40.799> really<00:02:41.400> just<00:02:41.489> a<00:02:41.880> case<00:02:42.630> it's

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
this which is really just a case it's

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.809 
this which is really just a case it's
not<00:02:43.019> a<00:02:43.049> dub<00:02:43.319> clip<00:02:43.590> so<00:02:43.799> here's<00:02:44.370> another<00:02:44.579> way

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
not a dub clip so here's another way

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.879 
not a dub clip so here's another way
that<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.120> m900<00:02:45.780> maybe<00:02:46.349> a<00:02:46.440> little<00:02:46.590> bit<00:02:46.769> better

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:46.889 
that the m900 maybe a little bit better

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:51.170 
that the m900 maybe a little bit better
than<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.250> touch<00:02:47.400> pro<00:02:47.579> to<00:02:48.290> smell<00:02:49.290> test<00:02:49.470> um<00:02:50.340> it

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
than the touch pro to smell test um it

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.670 
than the touch pro to smell test um it
smells<00:02:51.450> like<00:02:51.510> vinyl<00:02:51.810> so<00:02:52.200> it's<00:02:52.380> not<00:02:52.530> real

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
smells like vinyl so it's not real

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.870 
smells like vinyl so it's not real

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.170 
feels a little bit cheap I feel a little
bit<00:04:17.930> of<00:04:18.080> wiggling<00:04:18.650> but<00:04:19.549> left<00:04:19.730> to<00:04:19.850> talk<00:04:20.000> about

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
bit of wiggling but left to talk about

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.090 
bit of wiggling but left to talk about
that<00:04:20.420> the<00:04:20.840> keys<00:04:21.080> are<00:04:21.260> kind<00:04:21.530> of<00:04:21.650> raised<00:04:21.920> here

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
that the keys are kind of raised here

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.950 
that the keys are kind of raised here
anyway<00:04:25.100> let's<00:04:25.310> do<00:04:25.430> some<00:04:25.580> comparisons<00:04:26.300> with

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
anyway let's do some comparisons with

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.260 
anyway let's do some comparisons with
good<00:04:27.380> we<00:04:27.500> got<00:04:27.590> a<00:04:27.650> flash<00:04:27.860> on<00:04:28.040> the<00:04:28.070> back<00:04:28.280> so<00:04:29.030> Wow

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
good we got a flash on the back so Wow

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.750 
good we got a flash on the back so Wow
is<00:04:29.390> this<00:04:29.480> metal<00:04:29.870> maybe<00:04:30.500> metal<00:04:30.830> let's<00:04:31.520> do<00:04:31.610> some

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
is this metal maybe metal let's do some

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.160 
is this metal maybe metal let's do some
comparisons<00:04:32.240> with<00:04:32.360> other<00:04:32.450> devices<00:04:32.810> so<00:04:33.080> of

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.170 
comparisons with other devices so of

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.020 
comparisons with other devices so of
course<00:04:33.350> we<00:04:33.590> have<00:04:33.770> the<00:04:34.010> HTC<00:04:34.400> touch<00:04:35.030> HD<00:04:35.240> well

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
course we have the HTC touch HD well

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.660 
course we have the HTC touch HD well
which<00:04:38.030> has<00:04:38.180> the<00:04:38.300> same<00:04:38.510> size<00:04:38.780> screen<00:04:38.960> a<00:04:39.670> 3.8

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
which has the same size screen a 3.8

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.790 
which has the same size screen a 3.8
inch<00:04:40.700> screen<00:04:41.210> the<00:04:41.360> iphone<00:04:41.720> has<00:04:41.960> a<00:04:41.990> 3.5<00:04:42.470> inch

inch screen the iphone has a 3.5 inch

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.820 
inch screen the iphone has a 3.5 inch
screen<00:04:43.070> and<00:04:43.310> if<00:04:44.030> we<00:04:44.180> look<00:04:44.390> at<00:04:44.540> the<00:04:45.080> its

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
screen and if we look at the its

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.770 
screen and if we look at the its
competitor<00:04:46.400> the<00:04:46.550> touch<00:04:46.700> pro<00:04:46.880> to<00:04:47.000> the<00:04:47.600> touch

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
competitor the touch pro to the touch

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.870 
competitor the touch pro to the touch
pro<00:04:47.900> 2<00:04:48.110> only<00:04:48.710> has<00:04:48.890> a<00:04:48.920> three<00:04:49.340> point<00:04:49.520> six<00:04:49.670> inch

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
pro 2 only has a three point six inch

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.460 
pro 2 only has a three point six inch
screen<00:04:50.150> so<00:04:50.600> let's<00:04:50.780> take<00:04:50.900> a<00:04:50.960> look<00:04:51.140> at<00:04:51.230> how<00:04:51.350> they

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
screen so let's take a look at how they

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.830 
screen so let's take a look at how they
compare<00:04:51.650> in<00:04:51.860> thickness<00:04:52.250> the<00:04:53.060> m900<00:04:53.390> is

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
compare in thickness the m900 is

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.810 
compare in thickness the m900 is
definitely<00:04:54.380> thicker<00:04:54.650> and<00:04:54.980> it's<00:04:55.130> taller<00:04:55.460> and

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
definitely thicker and it's taller and

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.340 
definitely thicker and it's taller and
it's<00:04:56.030> wider<00:04:56.390> so<00:04:56.690> bigger<00:04:56.870> in<00:04:57.020> all<00:04:57.170> dimensions

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
it's wider so bigger in all dimensions

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.350 
it's wider so bigger in all dimensions
let's<00:04:58.190> take<00:04:58.340> a<00:04:58.370> look<00:04:58.580> at<00:04:58.640> how<00:04:58.790> the<00:04:58.850> keyboards

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
let's take a look at how the keyboards

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.330 
let's take a look at how the keyboards
compare<00:05:01.240> so<00:05:02.240> even<00:05:02.690> more<00:05:02.870> surface<00:05:03.260> area<00:05:03.440> on<00:05:03.800> the

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
compare so even more surface area on the

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.940 
compare so even more surface area on the
acer<00:05:04.790> tempo<00:05:05.150> m900<00:05:05.630> then<00:05:06.110> on<00:05:06.230> the<00:05:06.410> touch<00:05:06.590> pro<00:05:06.740> 2

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
acer tempo m900 then on the touch pro 2

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.320 
acer tempo m900 then on the touch pro 2
we<00:05:07.100> don't<00:05:07.280> have<00:05:07.400> a<00:05:07.430> dedicated<00:05:07.700> number<00:05:08.090> row

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
we don't have a dedicated number row

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.870 
we don't have a dedicated number row
unfortunately<00:05:09.050> we<00:05:09.680> have<00:05:09.770> soft<00:05:10.040> keys<00:05:10.310> which<00:05:10.670> a

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
unfortunately we have soft keys which a

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.010 
unfortunately we have soft keys which a
lot<00:05:11.090> of<00:05:11.120> people<00:05:11.210> will<00:05:11.510> probably<00:05:11.870> appreciate

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
lot of people will probably appreciate

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.210 
lot of people will probably appreciate
because<00:05:12.320> the<00:05:12.500> touch<00:05:12.650> pro<00:05:12.770> 2<00:05:12.920> doesn't<00:05:13.130> have

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
because the touch pro 2 doesn't have

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.920 
because the touch pro 2 doesn't have
soft<00:05:13.400> keys<00:05:13.580> and<00:05:13.760> of<00:05:14.060> course<00:05:14.090> the<00:05:14.390> touch<00:05:14.570> pro<00:05:14.750> 2

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
soft keys and of course the touch pro 2

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.200 
soft keys and of course the touch pro 2
as<00:05:15.080> the<00:05:15.170> tilting<00:05:15.560> screen<00:05:15.710> that<00:05:16.550> is<00:05:16.790> where<00:05:17.030> it

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
as the tilting screen that is where it

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.270 
as the tilting screen that is where it
really<00:05:17.270> Trump's<00:05:17.810> the<00:05:17.930> m900<00:05:18.560> this<00:05:19.010> doesn't

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
really Trump's the m900 this doesn't

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.710 
really Trump's the m900 this doesn't
have<00:05:19.370> a<00:05:19.430> tilting<00:05:19.790> screen<00:05:19.880> but<00:05:20.270> hey<00:05:20.450> look<00:05:20.600> at

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
have a tilting screen but hey look at

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.800 
have a tilting screen but hey look at
this<00:05:20.830> biometric<00:05:22.090> sensor<00:05:23.090> here<00:05:23.270> interesting

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
this biometric sensor here interesting

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.060 
this biometric sensor here interesting
so<00:05:24.260> let's<00:05:24.410> see<00:05:24.530> how<00:05:24.560> it<00:05:24.680> compares<00:05:25.310> to<00:05:25.790> the<00:05:27.070> HTC

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
so let's see how it compares to the HTC

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.150 
so let's see how it compares to the HTC
touch<00:05:28.280> pro<00:05:29.290> obviously<00:05:30.290> has<00:05:30.410> a<00:05:30.440> much<00:05:30.770> larger

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
touch pro obviously has a much larger

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.700 
touch pro obviously has a much larger
keyboard

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.060 

and<00:05:33.800> a<00:05:34.700> comparison<00:05:35.360> to<00:05:35.870> the<00:05:36.050> diamond<00:05:36.440> too<00:05:36.620> she

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
and a comparison to the diamond too she

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.820 
and a comparison to the diamond too she
has<00:05:37.160> a<00:05:37.190> smaller<00:05:37.520> 3.2<00:05:38.210> inch<00:05:38.390> screen<00:05:38.830> certainly

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
has a smaller 3.2 inch screen certainly

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.010 
has a smaller 3.2 inch screen certainly
much<00:05:40.040> smaller<00:05:40.370> so<00:05:41.030> in<00:05:41.120> terms<00:05:41.240> of<00:05:41.420> hardware<00:05:41.630> the

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
much smaller so in terms of hardware the

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.540 
much smaller so in terms of hardware the
hardware<00:05:42.350> is<00:05:42.440> pretty<00:05:42.740> impressive<00:05:43.100> on<00:05:43.520> the

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
hardware is pretty impressive on the

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.700 
hardware is pretty impressive on the
Easter<00:05:43.880> tempo<00:05:44.210> m900<00:05:44.600> of<00:05:45.170> course<00:05:45.350> it<00:05:45.440> all<00:05:45.530> comes

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
Easter tempo m900 of course it all comes

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.230 
Easter tempo m900 of course it all comes
down<00:05:45.770> the<00:05:45.950> soft<00:05:46.190> door<00:05:46.370> and<00:05:46.520> user<00:05:46.640> experience
