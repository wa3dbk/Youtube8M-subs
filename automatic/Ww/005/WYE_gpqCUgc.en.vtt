00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
on gingerbread or ICS basically we're

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.680 
on gingerbread or ICS basically we're
going<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:12.690> use<00:00:12.840> an<00:00:13.049> Odin<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:13.820> flash<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:15.120> rooted

going to use an Odin and flash a rooted
kernel<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.260> that's<00:00:16.800> pretty<00:00:17.010> much<00:00:17.520> it<00:00:17.789> so

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
kernel and that's pretty much it so

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
for that row three you have ICS just

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.200 
for that row three you have ICS just
make<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.289> note<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.800> those<00:00:47.100> because<00:00:47.489> there's<00:00:48.000> two

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
make a note of those because there's two

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.389 
make a note of those because there's two

hit<00:02:18.380> PDA<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:19.100> find<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:20.890> find<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.190> the<00:02:22.970> file

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
hit PDA and find the find the the file

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.710 
hit PDA and find the find the the file
you<00:02:23.510> downloaded<00:02:23.990> just<00:02:24.500> now<00:02:25.270> I'll<00:02:26.270> show<00:02:26.660> you

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
you downloaded just now I'll show you

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.199 
you downloaded just now I'll show you
that<00:02:27.050> it's<00:02:27.890> either<00:02:28.010> going<00:02:28.280> to<00:02:28.340> be<00:02:28.400> SIA<00:02:28.820> or

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
that it's either going to be SIA or

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.810 
that it's either going to be SIA or
speed<00:02:29.630> mod<00:02:29.840> if<00:02:30.650> you<00:02:30.709> flash<00:02:31.130> the<00:02:31.370> wrong<00:02:31.550> one<00:02:31.790> you

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
speed mod if you flash the wrong one you

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.940 
speed mod if you flash the wrong one you
can<00:02:32.150> always<00:02:32.450> come<00:02:32.720> back<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:32.959> reflash<00:02:33.920> the

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
can always come back and reflash the

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.840 
can always come back and reflash the
correct<00:02:34.580> one<00:02:34.790> so<00:02:34.819> there's<00:02:35.360> no<00:02:35.540> worries<00:02:36.080> there

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
correct one so there's no worries there

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.880 
correct one so there's no worries there
see<00:02:37.850> you<00:02:37.940> again<00:02:38.239> is<00:02:38.480> for<00:02:38.660> ICS<00:02:39.110> speed<00:02:39.380> mod<00:02:39.590> is

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
see you again is for ICS speed mod is

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.380 
see you again is for ICS speed mod is
for<00:02:40.310> Gingerbread

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
for Gingerbread

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.780 
for Gingerbread
I<00:02:41.420> have<00:02:41.780> gingerbread<00:02:42.410> on<00:02:42.560> my<00:02:42.860> galaxy<00:02:43.340> s2<00:02:43.430> right

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
I have gingerbread on my galaxy s2 right

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.210 
I have gingerbread on my galaxy s2 right
now<00:02:43.940> so<00:02:44.120> I'm<00:02:44.180> going<00:02:44.269> to<00:02:44.330> use<00:02:44.540> speed<00:02:44.810> not<00:02:45.220> open

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
now so I'm going to use speed not open

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.479 
now so I'm going to use speed not open
hit<00:02:46.640> start<00:02:47.000> and<00:02:47.239> this<00:02:48.080> will<00:02:48.320> flash<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:48.950> kernel

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
hit start and this will flash the kernel

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:57.880 
hit start and this will flash the kernel
um<00:02:49.840> with<00:02:51.160> with<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:54.790> with<00:02:55.790> root<00:02:56.269> and<00:02:56.739> this<00:02:57.739> will

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
um with with the with root and this will

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.009 
um with with the with root and this will
work<00:02:58.100> on<00:02:58.250> all<00:02:58.430> Gingerbread<00:02:59.209> so<00:02:59.690> that<00:02:59.870> way<00:02:59.989> I

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
work on all Gingerbread so that way I

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.170 
work on all Gingerbread so that way I
had<00:03:00.320> the<00:03:00.590> method<00:03:00.920> one<00:03:01.160> where<00:03:01.370> you<00:03:01.519> look<00:03:02.150> for

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
had the method one where you look for

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.720 
had the method one where you look for
unsecured<00:03:02.870> kernels<00:03:03.350> or<00:03:03.470> whatever<00:03:03.709> but<00:03:04.459> you

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
unsecured kernels or whatever but you

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.520 
unsecured kernels or whatever but you
can<00:03:04.880> also<00:03:05.030> use<00:03:05.209> this<00:03:05.600> method<00:03:05.840> which<00:03:06.140> is<00:03:06.290> a<00:03:06.320> lot

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
can also use this method which is a lot

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.990 
can also use this method which is a lot
simpler<00:03:07.239> gives<00:03:08.239> you<00:03:08.390> Auto<00:03:08.600> roots<00:03:08.959> and<00:03:10.000> let's

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
simpler gives you Auto roots and let's

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.870 
simpler gives you Auto roots and let's
switch<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.420> angle<00:03:11.720> here<00:03:11.989> so<00:03:13.180> here<00:03:14.180> we<00:03:14.360> go<00:03:14.600> and

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
switch the angle here so here we go and

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.960 
switch the angle here so here we go and
go<00:03:16.880> here<00:03:17.410> if<00:03:18.410> you<00:03:18.560> go<00:03:18.680> to<00:03:18.739> applications<00:03:19.579> you

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
go here if you go to applications you

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.300 
go here if you go to applications you
should<00:03:20.239> either<00:03:20.450> have<00:03:20.660> super<00:03:21.410> user<00:03:21.620> or<00:03:21.769> super

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
should either have super user or super

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.270 
should either have super user or super

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
the thing with the Galaxy S 2 is that

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.200 
the thing with the Galaxy S 2 is that
the<00:03:56.180> kernels<00:03:56.630> come<00:03:57.020> with<00:03:57.590> recovery<00:03:58.460> which

everything is ready to go so that's
pretty<00:04:14.870> much<00:04:14.960> it<00:04:15.110> just<00:04:15.410> use<00:04:16.340> the<00:04:16.640> again<00:04:17.209> see<00:04:17.540> a

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
pretty much it just use the again see a
