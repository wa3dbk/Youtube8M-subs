00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:16.810
 earn money from a business there is no 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:21.240

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.980
 the line 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:38.590
 because now 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:41.470
 has won the jewel of the mind and it is already 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.340
 everything fixed already goes with the street or 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.340

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.870
 rajoy and then they change the time they have 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.940

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.110

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.570

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.570
 of course it's in the background when it sees you 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.040
 it ends the more scream and screaming 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.040

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:28.960

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:42.110

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:44.449

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:58.430
