now there's another optional extra which
is<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.280> center<00:01:50.700> pole<00:01:50.880> for<00:01:51.570> people<00:01:51.810> who<00:01:51.869> like<00:01:52.049> to

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
is a center pole for people who like to

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.249 
is a center pole for people who like to
use<00:01:52.350> those<00:01:52.670> just<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.759> couple<00:01:54.000> other<00:01:54.119> things

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259
