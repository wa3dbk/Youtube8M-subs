00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.460
 and install it so I'll hold you to you 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.439
 also specify that you will not have 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.420
 need usb key or cd 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.779
 you need them 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.750
 only software that will mount 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:36.450
 the iso images 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:38.489
 So therefore that's all guti Tauriel 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.469
 first you will download this moment 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:46.350
 this software called virtual drives 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:48.809

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.950
 me so all the ways I you 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.950
 will put the links in the discretion 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:01.969
 it was not heavy files and psa them 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:03.870
 systems where I believe but rather there has 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.450
 save do not shit I have not 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.619

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:15.210
 so that's after this if you do not know 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:19.259
 still you go in the second 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.619
 although I will give you for 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.270
 windows 8 points 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.500
 so I want to clarify that there will be 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.100
 two versions the burst will be the 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.100
 64-bit and 32-bit and havas 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.329
 if you have not a little windows 7 and 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.770
 you want to switch to windows and points 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.840
 if your version of windows 7 and 32 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.229
 bits we will not be able to install the way of 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:47.340
 64 bits you require 3.32 by sap in 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:50.040
 danger and to find out if you have the 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.299
 vase in 32 bits or 64 bits 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:57.390
 you will then go into you go into the 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.130
 pc and you will go from a property system 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.909
 lighthouse insisted 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.869
 alas bassano will show you if the 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:12.269
 32-bit or if the 64-bit 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:20.000
 So here you are 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:22.410
 download a dose point iso 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.380
 intervene on download so you 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.440
 will have like I said to have 75 32 in the 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.060
 English and Spanish version also at 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.950
 you choose 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:39.599
 so I take it the 32-bit version 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:41.160
 here and you have to download so 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.349
 that's it was loaded into the eight 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.630
 seconds so display that's enough 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:50.099
 heavy and hard weighs France to show you 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.910
 if you have a good connection it can 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:55.860
 to go between 10 and 15 minutes if you 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.540
 a good connection but if your 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.459
 connection is not very good it can 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:05.220
 to be a bit slow so here is after 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:08.150
 as your file is downloaded you 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.920
 will be able to install the virtual clonedrive 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.810
 so I uninstalled but I will see the 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.359
 reinstall for twenty men 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.630
 expect and that's a small 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:17.630
 problem 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:25.450
 So here I am again sorry me so here 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:25.450
 you will install 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.890
 I agree if they go there 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.359
 install 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.359
 it's pretty fast installation 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:42.769
 so now you're going to go 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:46.189
 in the computer and then you go 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:50.030
 see that year in this city of ras 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:53.180
 just your hard drive and the supporter of the 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.489
 hard drive so we can see it 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:04:01.609
 there is not any at all there it asks me to his 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:06.919
 disks there too so it was for 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:09.739
 show so there you go to go in 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:12.909
 an eye plug or your iso image but 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:15.349
 you will do 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:17.349
 excuse me first to follow 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:20.269

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:26.990
