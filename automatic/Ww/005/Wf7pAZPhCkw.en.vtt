00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
settings area which now works exactly

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.480 
settings area which now works exactly
like<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.330> galaxy<00:01:15.689> s4<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:16.650> everything<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.369> now

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
like the galaxy s4 so everything is now

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.060 
like the galaxy s4 so everything is now
split<00:01:17.850> down<00:01:18.240> into<00:01:19.080> these<00:01:19.380> four<00:01:19.439> core<00:01:20.040> areas

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
split down into these four core areas

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.760 
split down into these four core areas
across<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.909> top<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.390> then<00:01:22.020> more<00:01:22.229> information

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
across the top and then more information

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.609 
across the top and then more information
underneath<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.700> if<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.720> go<00:01:24.900> into<00:01:25.049> connections

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
underneath so if you go into connections

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.230 
underneath so if you go into connections
you've<00:01:25.890> got<00:01:26.070> your<00:01:26.250> access<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.670> your<00:01:26.790> Wi-Fi

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
you've got your access to your Wi-Fi

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.749 
you've got your access to your Wi-Fi
Bluetooth<00:01:27.689> data<00:01:28.259> usage<00:01:28.680> networks<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.729> can

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
Bluetooth data usage networks you can

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.330 
Bluetooth data usage networks you can
now<00:01:29.970> turn<00:01:30.030> NFC<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.200> S<00:01:31.350> beam<00:01:31.619> features<00:01:32.130> off

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
now turn NFC and the S beam features off

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.399 
now turn NFC and the S beam features off
on<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.790> off<00:01:32.850> directly<00:01:33.600> from<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.020> connections
