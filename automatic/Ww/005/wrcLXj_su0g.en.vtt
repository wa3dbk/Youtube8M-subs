00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.290
 when you are ready 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.439
 there is no crueler way to get lost if 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.160
 the truth that is a very very 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.930
 cruel 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.210
 because the team has made a great 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:29.380
 a huge great party game 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:31.269
 effort and the truth that 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.550
 everything has gone back that for a bad 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:36.699
 decision of the referee gives me a lot 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.610
 anger not because it is very clear to 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:43.260
 throwing for us also has 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:46.570
 told the players to take off fast 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.839
 side has left for backwards to 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.899
 to remove the end I left that 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:54.899
 I get out of valència 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.899
 freaking 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.080
 apart from that circumstance I believe 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.020
 that the valladolid today has changed 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.550
 absolutely the load that we have made 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.150
 a great match against a great 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.729
 team we have played we have played even 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.210
 with 10 players the team has done very 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.970
 good match and 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.690
 you can only congratulate the team with a 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.230
 party that there is security 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.240
 mister 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.830
 It has not been very clear to me that the 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.590
 collegiate what has been marked has been 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.480
 bands in favor of the real valladolid and that 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.370
 as they have not removed their players has 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.420
 finished removing the valence yes yes yes yes 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:36.090
 yeah well almost lacerating been told that 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.910
 that will make pine and lateral has already gone to 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.900
 your site to defend and that is removed 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.730
 not end and if I take valencia and left that 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.050
 take the valence to the exit when 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.050

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.690

 107.1 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.350
 there's been a lot of talk I'm not going to ask 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:02.390
 for the party because he is already commenting 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:07.790
 the party because other things I do not 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:09.860
 they interest me and I only focus on 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.650
 the valladolid in the fight that we are 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.990
 involved in the struggle to fulfill our 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.520
 objective and other things I do not want 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.300
 focus then without asking and has 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.300

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.510
 it has to do with the game and 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.890
 continuation to mind is the first time 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.269
 after so many years as a player of 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.189
 valència that you come to mestalla as 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.849
 professional coach 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:36.040
 regardless of the result what's up 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:38.260
 it is sense if good that is 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.959
 the first time as as entered that I 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.959
 I sit on the bench valence 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:47.409
 gravity that whenever you want to always 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:51.580
 it's special to come here to my house and the 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:54.880
 true that very happy and 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:58.000
 of step mestalla and the truth that good 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.010
 that even more or not and happy because the 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.070
 team has made a great match and 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.530
 we have planted a big team 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.810
 how is valence and always for me is 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.670
 very nice to come here the same as 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.380
 we say a few days some things you have to 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.800
 say them also when they happen backwards 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.180
 today he has made a still big game 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.590
 dani hernandez and has made his friend yes yes 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.690
 yes no but all that when we complain 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.300
 when they do not go well it would be illustrated 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.340
 and it has become great like the rest 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.000
 of the team the truth that they have made a 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.110
 great effort playing playing 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.450
 sacrificing for the team and the 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.970
 true that you can only congratulate the 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.550
 team because they have done very good match 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.580
 very complete very daring even with 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:43.300
 ten have gone up to squeeze the 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:48.060
 rival the truth that we have done today very 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.060
 good match but there was no reward 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.590
 one day less with the results that 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.340
 have been given as you see your face team 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.260
 to 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:00.250
 to salvation above all we are not and 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.650
 we're all in there and I thought 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:07.180
 that we are not going to suffer has been 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.540
 wrong because the normal thing is I can 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.480
 say that 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.879
 at the beginning of the season that nobody gave 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.489
 anything for this team everyone 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:19.160
 I thought we're going to be the maximum 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:23.120
 candidate to go down we are nine 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:26.840
 points in our house we come to 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.729
 play sports in the Celtic or is 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.789
 direct rivals that is to say we have the 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:36.380
 situation in our hands and we 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:38.770
 we will play the league in our house some 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.770
 last question
