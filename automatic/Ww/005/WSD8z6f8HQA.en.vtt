had the satellite you 920 T which was

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.499 
had the satellite you 920 T which was
12.5<00:01:25.530> inches<00:01:25.950> but<00:01:26.400> my<00:01:26.520> personal<00:01:26.939> favorite<00:01:27.360> was

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
12.5 inches but my personal favorite was

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.749 
12.5 inches but my personal favorite was
Adele<00:01:28.049> duo<00:01:28.259> 12<00:01:28.740> which<00:01:29.009> had<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.189> swivel<00:01:29.640> screen

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
Adele duo 12 which had a swivel screen

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.840 
Adele duo 12 which had a swivel screen
and<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.110> kind<00:01:31.259> of<00:01:31.290> rotated<00:01:31.710> around<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.340> I

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
and so it kind of rotated around and I

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.460 
and so it kind of rotated around and I
really<00:01:33.390> thought<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.750> they<00:01:33.869> improved<00:01:34.229> on<00:01:34.350> the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
really thought that they improved on the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.319 
really thought that they improved on the
original<00:01:34.890> duo<00:01:35.100> because<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:36.030> has<00:01:36.210> an

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
original duo because this has an

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.600 
original duo because this has an
aluminum<00:01:36.570> kind<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.259> casing<00:01:37.710> with<00:01:38.100> carbon

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
aluminum kind of casing with carbon

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.310 
aluminum kind of casing with carbon
fiber<00:01:38.880> which<00:01:39.150> makes<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.540> really<00:01:39.600> compelling

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
fiber which makes it really compelling

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.649 
fiber which makes it really compelling
if<00:01:41.100> you're<00:01:41.340> in<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.640> market<00:01:41.820> for<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.270> hybrid

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
if you're in the market for a hybrid

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.780 
if you're in the market for a hybrid
with<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.869> detachable<00:01:43.229> keyboard<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:44.130> would<00:01:44.610> keep

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
with a detachable keyboard I would keep

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.730 
with a detachable keyboard I would keep
an<00:01:44.909> eye<00:01:45.090> out<00:01:45.119> for<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.630> asuste<00:01:45.960> vivotab<00:01:46.320> and

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
an eye out for the asuste vivotab and

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.969 
an eye out for the asuste vivotab and
vivotab<00:01:47.369> RT<00:01:47.729> we<00:01:48.540> saw<00:01:48.720> these<00:01:48.869> at<00:01:49.020> computex<00:01:49.560> but

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
vivotab RT we saw these at computex but

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.679 
vivotab RT we saw these at computex but
now<00:01:50.100> they<00:01:50.250> have<00:01:50.280> proper<00:01:50.729> branding<00:01:51.180> so

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
now they have proper branding so
