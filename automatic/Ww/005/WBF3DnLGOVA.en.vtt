00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:11.700
 hello everyone I hope you are very well 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.230
 as well all the good video we are going to 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.820
 review a little what are the mounts 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.310
 pigs already have time that we leave them 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.920
 abandoned and then if I would be interested 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.630
 attack with them or see how they are 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.180
 running right now with the new things 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.310
 that there is already a difference from before that it was 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.769
 100% common to ports so we're going to 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.660
 bring this that the witches could see 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.850
 to kill the enemy's castle and that 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.340
 yes, we are going to take it out, not the kings, 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.200
 only my queen spells 3 this 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.420
 nation is a freeze and a rage 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.820
 everything is to the maximum and good we are going to 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.560
 attack 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:47.030
 to see if there is a revenge to which 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:50.629
 woman we are not going to look for a game 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.600
 ok let's see if we get a good 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.820
 defense I'm seeing that these have a 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.469
 target the infernal tower so it's going to 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.890
 be a good idea to attack we are already seeing 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:02.420
 let's have no kings we will go 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.210
 pretty good to see if we can do it 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.340
 100% I hope that if we go for the 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.229
 royal castle we're going to draw him against 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.670
 pigs both pigs to see 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.490
 that have this castle that are not 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.619
 magicians and see are going out mountain 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.540
 crows ok what's going to go pretty 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.899
 well in this village so we're going to 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.090
 call these pigs here up there 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:25.550
 there's no defense so we let go of 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.159
 witches and the barbarians to destroy this 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.869
 castle 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.640
 I hope that surely they are the 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.429
 amounts pigs because we're going to let go 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.079
 he mounts pigs on the right side and 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:37.270
 on the left side because the 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:38.710
 mortars not helping why worry 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.689
 the most important thing is to get to the 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.759
 center but if we're going to start dropping 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:44.709
 a this nation on each side so that 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.319
 the hell tower arrives well and enters 

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:50.200
 action so we need to get closer 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:52.270
 pretty fast here a rage for 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.359
 clean up this whole freezing zone 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.009
 I just freeze and the testers had 

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:58.240
 forgotten is all the skeletons to see 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.189
 if they do not distract me a lot they ride them 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.969
 pigs minga pump and to luck one 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:03.340
 healing ok 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:05.740
 I think we are a bit rushed 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.530
 here every towers wizard 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.410
 my photo another bomb are coming out these 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.209
 skeletons that did not really come out before 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.459
 if they can be killing us some 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.349
 pigs ride these skeletons that 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.239
 they take my magicians upstairs 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.970
 I only want this crossbow that 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.800
 no pig mountain was for her but 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.769
 with the queen that I think will be more 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.540
 enough to do both 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.430
 stars there is no other 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.040
 defense the queen is left to be able to 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.349
 all this is magician on the right side 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.440
 on the left side I'm going to release the 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:40.930
 minions that he brought too and I do not think 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.010
 to do 100% I was pretty close 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.470
 of time I feel I'm going to stay 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.750
 quite close but I will not achieve 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.760
 on the left and up to the percentage 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.040
 free and if you see the difference not from 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.010
 that new levels of towers have come out 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.480
 of archers the three the difference of 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.600
 before everything was lower thank you 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.370
 100% some village the monkeys as there is no 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.900
 to worry so much about pigs 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.900
 always the ones to jump 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.769
 9 are always going to be jumping 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.379
 pumps, so you can now 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.780
 improve and do more damage the skeletons 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.730
 that told them and then the kings who did not 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.129
 you can take them out in this case it was something 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.349
 easy but I think if we look for a 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:23.319
 most complicated village at maximum level with 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:24.849
 reid in multiple objectives the towers 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.580
 hell yes it's going to be harder to 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:29.620
 get more percentage or even 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.269
 make him one or two stars but the 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.849
 trying this was a little practice 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:36.220
 it went pretty well read more with 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:38.440
 pretty lucky the first one that comes out very 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.450
 good and we see here the queen who 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.910
 about all the defenses here 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.270
 we bring a little bit these senses need 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.610
 help 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:51.770
 and his skill here I think if 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:55.340
 we make 85 percent and 85 percent 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:57.920
 hundred finally I tell you let's do 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.960
 this attack with an idea to the maximum and with 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.520
 the kings to see how we are doing by 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.890
 at least we can get two stars and 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.680
 give me enough percentage as 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.680
 This is how it was easy for us, but if there is 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.450
 different things that we did not have before and 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.850
 it was easier for a while if it's in 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:18.250
 end I hope you liked it and we 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.250
 we see until the next video by
