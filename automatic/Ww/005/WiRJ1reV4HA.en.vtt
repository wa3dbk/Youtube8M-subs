00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
really long time so now I'm going to

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.380 
really long time so now I'm going to
talk<00:00:45.159> about<00:00:45.190> how<00:00:45.550> these<00:00:45.850> wheels<00:00:46.149> are

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
talk about how these wheels are

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.479 
talk about how these wheels are
different<00:00:46.839> than<00:00:47.050> orangutangs<00:00:47.859> past<00:00:48.159> feels

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
different than orangutangs past feels

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.369 
different than orangutangs past feels
like<00:00:48.640> the<00:00:48.760> morongo<00:00:49.089> and<00:00:49.300> stimulus<00:00:49.960> at<00:00:50.199> that

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
like the morongo and stimulus at that

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:52.069 
like the morongo and stimulus at that
green<00:00:50.679> and<00:00:50.800> all<00:00:50.859> their<00:00:51.069> other<00:00:51.100> stuff

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
green and all their other stuff

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.540 
green and all their other stuff
obviously<00:00:53.079> we<00:00:53.739> already<00:00:53.949> talked<00:00:54.190> about<00:00:54.280> the

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
obviously we already talked about the

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.219 
obviously we already talked about the
new<00:00:54.670> PG<00:00:54.940> year<00:00:55.239> thing<00:00:56.280> they<00:00:57.280> have<00:00:57.460> the<00:00:57.640> new<00:00:57.789> core

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:58.229 
new PG year thing they have the new core

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:01.379 
new PG year thing they have the new core
that's<00:00:59.229> this<00:00:59.649> big<00:00:59.979> red<00:01:00.370> court<00:01:00.699> it's<00:01:00.969> really

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:01.389 
that's this big red court it's really

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:03.840 
that's this big red court it's really
nice<00:01:01.569> because<00:01:01.870> it<00:01:02.800> was<00:01:02.859> the<00:01:03.370> lips<00:01:03.609> are<00:01:03.760> the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
nice because it was the lips are the

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.270 
nice because it was the lips are the
real<00:01:04.030> nice<00:01:04.299> and<00:01:04.479> solid<00:01:04.719> and<00:01:05.079> it<00:01:05.740> really<00:01:05.950> helps

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
real nice and solid and it really helps

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.130 
real nice and solid and it really helps
reduce<00:01:06.520> chatter<00:01:06.850> so<00:01:07.149> they<00:01:07.329> give<00:01:07.570> the<00:01:07.719> wheel<00:01:07.869> a

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
reduce chatter so they give the wheel a

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.709 
reduce chatter so they give the wheel a
extremely<00:01:08.829> clean<00:01:09.100> slide<00:01:09.430> that<00:01:09.790> I<00:01:10.060> haven't

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:10.719 
extremely clean slide that I haven't

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:13.740 
extremely clean slide that I haven't
felt<00:01:11.020> on<00:01:11.200> any<00:01:11.380> wheel<00:01:11.619> before<00:01:12.040> they<00:01:12.490> are<00:01:12.750> the

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
felt on any wheel before they are the

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.350 
felt on any wheel before they are the
cleanest<00:01:14.229> wheels<00:01:14.500> I've<00:01:14.890> ever<00:01:15.070> been<00:01:15.310> and<00:01:15.700> it

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
cleanest wheels I've ever been and it

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.120 
cleanest wheels I've ever been and it
gives<00:01:16.600> them<00:01:16.780> an<00:01:16.899> incredibly<00:01:17.380> predictable

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
gives them an incredibly predictable

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.910 
gives them an incredibly predictable
look<00:01:19.060> up<00:01:19.270> and<00:01:19.509> release<00:01:19.750> point<00:01:20.079> so<00:01:20.619> you<00:01:20.680> can

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
look up and release point so you can

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.679 
look up and release point so you can
really<00:01:21.219> have<00:01:21.460> a<00:01:21.520> lot<00:01:21.640> of<00:01:22.000> control<00:01:22.420> when<00:01:22.600> you're

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689 
really have a lot of control when you're

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:24.359 
really have a lot of control when you're
pushing<00:01:23.079> your<00:01:23.170> board<00:01:23.380> sideways<00:01:23.649> if<00:01:24.039> you<00:01:24.159> want

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
pushing your board sideways if you want

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.490 
pushing your board sideways if you want
to<00:01:24.490> hold<00:01:25.180> out<00:01:25.360> your<00:01:25.509> spine<00:01:25.780> all<00:01:26.170> the<00:01:26.229> way<00:01:26.439> to

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
to hold out your spine all the way to

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.399 
to hold out your spine all the way to
eat<00:01:26.710> stuff<00:01:26.950> or<00:01:27.310> just<00:01:27.640> push<00:01:28.509> it<00:01:28.659> out<00:01:28.750> really

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
eat stuff or just push it out really

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.289 
eat stuff or just push it out really
quickly<00:01:29.740> and<00:01:30.039> just<00:01:30.340> kill<00:01:30.789> a<00:01:30.820> little<00:01:31.030> bit<00:01:31.210> of

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
quickly and just kill a little bit of

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:36.820 
quickly and just kill a little bit of
speed

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.490 

first<00:01:37.830> talk<00:01:38.610> about<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.940> the<00:01:39.060> cage<00:01:39.300> like<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.260> said

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
first talk about is the cage like I said

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.010 
first talk about is the cage like I said
it's<00:01:40.650> 73<00:01:41.190> millimeters<00:01:41.760> tall<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.420> has<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.630> forty

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
it's 73 millimeters tall it has a forty

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.710 
it's 73 millimeters tall it has a forty
one<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.320> half<00:01:43.470> millimeter<00:01:43.980> contact<00:01:44.430> patch

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
one and a half millimeter contact patch

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.390 
one and a half millimeter contact patch
because<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:46.050> its<00:01:46.170> larger<00:01:46.530> size<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.010> contact

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
because of its larger size and contact

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.980 
because of its larger size and contact
catches<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.060> creepiest<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.600> all<00:01:48.750> three

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
catches the creepiest of all three

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.080 
catches the creepiest of all three
wheels<00:01:49.260> but<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.130> also<00:01:50.280> has<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.610> highest<00:01:50.640> roll

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
wheels but it also has the highest roll

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.270 
wheels but it also has the highest roll
speed<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.660> think<00:01:52.530> it's<00:01:52.650> best<00:01:52.860> for<00:01:52.980> a<00:01:53.130> higher

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
speed I think it's best for a higher

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.250 
speed I think it's best for a higher
speed<00:01:53.640> free<00:01:53.880> riding<00:01:54.150> where<00:01:54.570> control<00:01:55.140> of

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
speed free riding where control of

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.350 
speed free riding where control of
predictability<00:01:55.770> are<00:01:56.010> more<00:01:56.190> important<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:57.270> I

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
predictability are more important and I

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.790 
predictability are more important and I
think<00:01:57.390> it's<00:01:57.720> also<00:01:57.900> a<00:01:58.080> great<00:01:58.260> wheel<00:01:58.560> for

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
think it's also a great wheel for

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.050 
think it's also a great wheel for
charging<00:01:59.190> down<00:01:59.340> mountain<00:01:59.670> runs<00:01:59.880> and

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
charging down mountain runs and

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.230 
charging down mountain runs and
confidence<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.840> drifting<00:02:01.170> through<00:02:01.290> corners

the<00:02:03.240> next<00:02:03.510> wheel<00:02:03.630> I'm<00:02:03.750> going<00:02:03.870> to<00:02:03.930> talk<00:02:04.080> about

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
the next wheel I'm going to talk about

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.950 
the next wheel I'm going to talk about
is<00:02:04.440> the<00:02:04.530> killer<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:05.580> killer<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:06.150> the<00:02:06.180> 69

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
is the killer the killer is the 69

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.320 
is the killer the killer is the 69

thirty nine and a half millimeter
contact<00:02:11.160> catch<00:02:11.840> this<00:02:12.840> feels<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.200> nice<00:02:13.410> medium

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
contact catch this feels a nice medium

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.550 
contact catch this feels a nice medium
between<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.280> cage<00:02:14.640> in<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:14.970> canyon<00:02:15.390> because

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
between the cage in the canyon because

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.410 
between the cage in the canyon because
it's<00:02:16.560> still<00:02:16.890> nimble<00:02:17.490> enough<00:02:17.550> to<00:02:17.790> throw<00:02:18.330> out

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
it's still nimble enough to throw out

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.740 
it's still nimble enough to throw out
really<00:02:18.840> fast<00:02:19.110> 360s<00:02:20.040> in<00:02:20.220> techie<00:02:20.610> tricks<00:02:20.910> but

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
really fast 360s in techie tricks but

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.420 
really fast 360s in techie tricks but
it's<00:02:21.870> still<00:02:22.080> large<00:02:22.560> enough<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:22.950> tall<00:02:23.160> enough

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
it's still large enough and tall enough

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.910 
it's still large enough and tall enough
to<00:02:23.610> take<00:02:23.790> newly<00:02:24.180> pass<00:02:24.390> runs<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.620> you<00:02:25.770> know

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
to take newly pass runs and you know

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.100 
to take newly pass runs and you know
have<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.280> nice<00:02:26.460> grip<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.240> slip<00:02:27.450> ratio<00:02:27.660> of

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
have the nice grip and slip ratio of

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.440 
have the nice grip and slip ratio of
your<00:02:28.290> corners<00:02:28.680> so<00:02:29.640> this<00:02:29.880> is<00:02:30.060> probably<00:02:30.360> the

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
your corners so this is probably the

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.790 
your corners so this is probably the
best<00:02:30.630> all<00:02:30.960> the<00:02:30.990> way<00:02:31.080> on<00:02:31.230> another<00:02:31.530> three

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
best all the way on another three

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.040 
best all the way on another three
whatever<00:02:32.580> you<00:02:32.850> throw<00:02:33.090> at<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.330> it's<00:02:33.600> gonna<00:02:33.810> do

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
whatever you throw at it it's gonna do

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.940 
whatever you throw at it it's gonna do
it<00:02:34.200> very<00:02:34.380> well

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
it very well

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.740 
it very well
you<00:02:35.460> can<00:02:35.640> really<00:02:35.880> can't<00:02:36.120> go<00:02:36.270> wrong<00:02:36.420> with<00:02:36.660> this

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
you can really can't go wrong with this

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.340 
you can really can't go wrong with this
wheel<00:02:37.020> and<00:02:38.150> finally<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.270> canyon<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.990> canton

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
wheel and finally the canyon the canton

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.170 
wheel and finally the canyon the canton
of<00:02:40.410> sixty<00:02:40.800> six<00:02:41.070> millimeters<00:02:41.580> tall<00:02:41.820> and<00:02:42.090> is<00:02:42.150> a

of sixty six millimeters tall and is a
38<00:02:42.720> millimeter<00:02:43.200> contact<00:02:43.590> patch<00:02:44.030> it's<00:02:45.030> my

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
38 millimeter contact patch it's my

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.720 
38 millimeter contact patch it's my
favorite<00:02:45.720> of<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.900> three<00:02:46.110> new<00:02:46.260> wheels<00:02:46.730> some

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
favorite of the three new wheels some

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.210 
favorite of the three new wheels some
things<00:02:47.940> I<00:02:48.030> liked<00:02:48.239> about<00:02:48.360> it<00:02:48.570> are<00:02:48.900> I<00:02:48.930> like<00:02:49.470> the

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
things I liked about it are I like the

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.160 
things I liked about it are I like the
small<00:02:50.520> size<00:02:50.820> so<00:02:51.360> that<00:02:51.510> gives<00:02:51.690> it<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:51.900> lot<00:02:52.050> of

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
small size so that gives it a lot of

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.770 
small size so that gives it a lot of
agility<00:02:52.650> for<00:02:52.890> my<00:02:53.120> 360s<00:02:54.120> into<00:02:54.360> technical

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
agility for my 360s into technical

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.320 
agility for my 360s into technical
tricks<00:02:55.130> and<00:02:56.130> because<00:02:56.610> of<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.790> size<00:02:57.000> it<00:02:57.180> also

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
tricks and because of the size it also

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.810 
tricks and because of the size it also
accelerates<00:02:57.780> for<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.230> key<00:02:58.440> key<00:02:58.620> it<00:02:59.430> slides

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
accelerates for the key key it slides

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.870 
accelerates for the key key it slides
furthest<00:03:00.630> and<00:03:00.660> is<00:03:00.959> there<00:03:01.140> really

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
furthest and is there really

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.000 
furthest and is there really
we<00:03:02.000> you<00:03:02.360> know<00:03:02.480> kills<00:03:02.870> very<00:03:03.110> little<00:03:03.470> speed<00:03:03.710> and

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
we you know kills very little speed and

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.730 
we you know kills very little speed and
I<00:03:04.760> have<00:03:05.000> a<00:03:05.210> lot<00:03:05.600> of<00:03:05.630> fun<00:03:05.930> on<00:03:05.960> this<00:03:06.140> wheel<00:03:06.380> you

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
I have a lot of fun on this wheel you

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.910 
I have a lot of fun on this wheel you
can<00:03:06.920> just<00:03:07.100> really<00:03:07.460> do<00:03:07.700> a<00:03:07.730> lot<00:03:07.970> on<00:03:08.090> it<00:03:08.270> and<00:03:08.920> I

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
can just really do a lot on it and I

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.590 
can just really do a lot on it and I
mean<00:03:10.160> I<00:03:10.370> really<00:03:10.460> can't<00:03:10.940> say<00:03:11.150> anything<00:03:11.180> bad

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
mean I really can't say anything bad

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.930 
mean I really can't say anything bad
about<00:03:11.750> it
