00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:09.210
 hello my name is martin welcome 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.410
 kraft kitchens if you fancy 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.570
 to impress your world with a 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.910
 ultra original recipe I propose you 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.710
 our grill and spinach pizza in 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.000
 alfredo sauce yes more is a 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.230
 recipe that is done on the bench has lived 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.330
 by the way the first thing to do 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.830
 it's to preheat the bench has lived to 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.730
 medium fire always important to 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.220
 preheat according to the temperature 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.410
 adequate by relying on the recipe is 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.080
 particularly dense so if so fire 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.270
 meanwhile I'm going to do that 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.860
 heat a cup of alfredo sauce 3 4 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.239
 minutes in a saucepan over medium heat 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.620
 until hot 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.809
 and we will stir from time to time when 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.359
 it's hot we will add 300 g 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.249
 of spinach lunch and well drained 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:50.300
 more important and a teaspoon of 

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:50.300
 red chilli crush 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.810
 and when it's good to mix 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:04.040
 fire and cover to keep the 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:06.320
 room I have a bath it's a ball of 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.510
 700 grams of pizza dough in a circle 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.360
 14 inches on a surface slightly 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.330
 floured then I transferred my dough 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.850
 on a pizza plate slightly 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.320
 spray to endure cooking now 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.300
 before putting on the grid 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.220
 we want to brush with a little oil 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.080
 olive is important always used 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.090
 a pizza dough chilled his teeth 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.580
 found at the grocery store either in the radius 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.649
 refrigerated or frozen but you 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.720
 can also get it from your 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:34.399
 foot behind the point we 're going now 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.960
 place our plate on the grid of 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.530
 barbecue to cook for 5 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.530
 minutes 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.810
 a pizza cooked on the bench with whom he 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.610
 looks a lot like a pizza from 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.800
 pizzerias because the heat of the 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.210
 barbecue is similar or roughly to 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.060
 that of a pizza oven 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.740
 compared to a conventional oven 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.810
 and in addition it will really give a 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.430
 little smoky taste at the door we are 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.330
 ready now to put the pad 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.360
 on our pizza 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.600
 I start with spinach 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.600
 sauce 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.780
 I also add a cup issued from 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.640
 boneless chicken breast and skin 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.860
 cooked and chopped into small pieces 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.569
 I also add a cup of cheese 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.270
 very sweet cheddar and small mozzarella 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.310
 quÃ©bec grated and to finish four 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.690
 low salt bacon slices 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.030
 cooked and humility 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.770
 we will now slide the pizza 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.330
 on the barbecue grill and continue 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.940
 cooking 5 to 7 minutes 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.680
 you could have also garnished the pizza 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.750
 directly on the barbecue grill 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.900
 but make sure you remove the plate 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.070
 previously the secret of our pizza 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.360
 for me to be crispy 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.489
 it is to cook the crust as one 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.019
 made 20 to garnish it this way 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.209
 there it does not spoil with the 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.890
 ingredients of the recipe in 30 minutes 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.360
 you have a tasty pizza you go 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.920

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.450
