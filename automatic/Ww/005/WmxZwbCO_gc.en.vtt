00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.319
 hello friends with you romance in this video 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.940
 we 'll figure it out 

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:10.830
 the songs of the group dancing minus flowers bloom 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.840
 this is a very interesting song first I 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.360
 she likes a lot and she is very easy 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.190
 is played so go as usual 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.750
 first i'm gonna get her on the game and then we 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.160
 you will separately analyze works right and 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.160
 left hand went 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.410
 here 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.610
 chorus 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.170
 Well 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.860
 Well, in principle, so here it is played 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.990
 roughly everything is pretty simple let's start with 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.660
 the verse that is when it all starts with 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.520
 em chords and at the very beginning of the first part 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.410
 the plates you may not even play fighting a 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.710
 just hold down when he says 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.360
 you are his face the eyes of your face are company and his 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.130
 faces 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.700
 that is, further and fly 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.280
 again to them 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:41.560
 and she m to us 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.590
 on md5 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.590
 and 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.960
 and we can go further here bye 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:58.200
 the weak will be so pleasant 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:58.200
 but rather trying billion 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.100
 him and so on 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.770
 chorus that's when the chorus starts you 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.750
 can strengthen your fight so he 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.260
 looked brighter play him brighter ok 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.260
 go 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.940
 brighter is played like the first two times 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:35.819
 then d is played again and this chord 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:37.380
 Hashem and then her again anew and ppm 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.090
 h &amp; m 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.010
 and e 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.840
 and it all repeats chords in couplets 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.920
 exactly the same way you repeat again not 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.040
 need to come up with something new 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.720
 so as for the chord hm but of course 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.500
 he is correctly clamped on maria 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.560
 since I am right now, its terminals 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.660
 but if you do not know how to pinch the bar 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.950
 then I'll show you how to do it now. 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:02.770
 to avoid 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:04.450
 This situation is looking like you 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.540
 pinch is obtained index 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.910
 finger at that first string on the second 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.170
 fret to this is certainly not desirable 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.360
 check but still have you want 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.920
 quicker to learn this song without barre 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.459
 resorting to you then try this 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.860
 option 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.750
 Although you may just be easier for 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.610
 couples that is to say i immediately but 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.480
 if without a bar and inspect the pointer to 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:28.630
 clamped on the first string 2 fret further 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:33.580
 middle finger pinches the second string 3 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:35.140
 freck little finger pinches the third side 4 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.330
 fret and ring finger clamps 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.630
 fourth string 4 fret and it turns out 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.630
 such a thing 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.439
 it's like you can say a fragment well then 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.370
 there are males in itself but as a chord 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:50.930
 you clamp it exactly so you need to play 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.939
 only jet loss which you 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.939
 clamp that is on the bottom 4 strings 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.950
 if you will play top sound 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.660
 as you hear will not play only 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.670
 bottom of this situation if you 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.560
 use this way to clamp it not 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.220
 forget to play only the bottom 4 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.450
 string 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.440
 ok means this is with us 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.380
 chords I think everything is clear here 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:18.380
 further the game is both the way about 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:21.230
 lyrics and chords themselves and download them 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.910
 by the link below under this video so don't 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.170
 worry if you do not immediately remember 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.680
 follow chords which I tell you 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:31.690
 now called mean so far about the fight 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.690
 my favorite fight is he played so 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:41.030
 hold down we turn off upstairs 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:44.180
 gun down and best upstairs 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:47.270
 best down best up up better 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.260
 down the best up you really he that is him 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.750
 can play watch 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:53.570
 thumb if you play down and 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:56.690
 puddles he can play his ball can 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.190
 play louder when you beat 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:03.860
 fingers on the side of that yes when you 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:05.930
 play for example the refrain instead of this 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.940
 jamming gently you can use 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.770
 hard jamming when you spend 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:14.020
 beat the strings with your finger and immediately 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.020
 jamming is such a thing turns 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.849
 What do I like this fight for? 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.409
 You can change to vary it as 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:23.330
 you wonder how you like those 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:25.699
 now what is the mood now how are you 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.289
 want to play this song okay so 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:29.960
 just mean fight 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:33.650
 down to the best upstairs is deafening and 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.960
 right here at the very end you can 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.430
 still use one holding up 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.189
 so as to connect these two fights 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:44.949
 it turns down we turn off upstairs upstairs 

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:50.210
 we can just play up and down 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:55.990
 pause so goes small you can play 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:55.990
 so you can play up 

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:03.910
 how are you doing so you play 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.440
 change practice I hope it is 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.639
 the video was useful to you by the way 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.919
 I have a survey for you, do you want to 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:11.530
 speed up the sivash is no longer possible while 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:13.240
 the guitar is, until your skills are not 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:15.220
 such that you wanted to see them 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:18.250
 I have a question from the elite you speed 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:20.319
 your progress at times if the answer is yes then 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:23.979
 then under this video you will find a book 

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:26.440
 which is called 5 secret skills 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:28.240
 successful guitarist in this book 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.580
 set out 5 very important principles 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.919
 understanding of which will allow you 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.320
 significantly speed up your development in 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:37.780
 playing guitar because many 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.880
 modern guitarists ignore them 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:43.210
 have a swing reading a book and pumping over 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:45.520
 cheeks apply your knowledge probably on 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:49.150
