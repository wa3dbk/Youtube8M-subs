00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 morning bernard rtl's guest poirette this 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.189
 sunday morning jean serra old pilot 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.240
 air france now consultant to the 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.429
 following aerial disasters 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.570
 hello sir squeezed a good game 8 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.940
 last March I remind him to 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.310
 listeners shortly after midnight a boeing 707 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.189
 from malaysia to kuala school airlines 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.439
 There are 2,139 people in lumpur for Beijing 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.710
 on board since we are without any 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.560
 new flight mh3 170 jean serrat 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.130
 let's first see what is certain we know 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.320
 precisely where the plane fell at sea 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.809
 yes we now have some 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.879
 precision on where the plane 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.980
 should be it's all there area 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.140
 they are looking for and years and again we 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.420
 knows about basten or dreams 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.850
 and very well we will re specify it in 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.170
 a moment we also know jean serrat that 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.570
 the plane is gone in the right 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.969
 north-northeast direction to Beijing and 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.280
 then he went full south quite 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.079
 there first fired west he passed 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.760
 vertical boundaries between the 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.770
 thailand from malaysia then the 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.049
 up the Strait of Malacca for 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.119
 go to the famous islands by damant 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.670
 there we lose sight of it, we lose it 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.040
 view we finally know jean serrat that there 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.780
 had no warning from the crew of 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.670
 two boeing drivers for a problem 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.680
 technical on board or a possible 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.390
 diversion in progress then no 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.520
 only there is no news of 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.020
 the crew but also remember that two 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.600
 means that can detect 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.000
 the plane were cut so 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.220
 volunteer want this plane is 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.750
 virtually vertical past four 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.460
 airports with more than 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.710
 3500 meters without ever landing 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.689
 so that poses real questions then 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.310
 of all these questions pull you 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.750
 some conclusions first is this 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.860
 that it seems to you that the hypothesis that 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.409
 much has been mentioned that 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.149
 the plane could be hijacked by one or 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.680
 the other driver for a reason 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.930
 mysterious and what she holds this 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.579
 hypothesis I do not believe it since the 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.200
 early I wanted I have already repeated 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.509
 many times I do not believe why 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.310
 because the captain who has the 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.619
 ability to take the oil he wants 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.770
 on board the plane took just the strict 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.079
 minimum for seniors completed 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.299
 second very important point ever this 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.220
 crew was only planned to fly together 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.869
 it's the chances of planning that have 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.340
 did they fly together so he 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.390
 there was not there could not be 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.069
 of collusion 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.540
 within the crew that's why 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.150
 from the beginning I'm not very 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.840
 favorable to the idea that one or 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.480
 the two more so both and 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.550
 foment the diversion of settat and the 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.110
 suicide the suicide hypothesis of one 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.580
 or both pilots so maybe a 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.000
 since it was not planned to steal 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.650
 together 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.330
 hey the guy he wants to commit suicide is there 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.950
 I do not believe in the thesis of suicide 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.410
 for a very simple reason it is that 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.020
 the plane flew, we know from a reliable source 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.000
 flew during this time I do not see 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.160
 why is someone going to commit suicide and 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.209
 shutters for seven hours heading south 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.489
 to the delights of the ocean 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.470
 I can not understand it 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.650
 so I know no more, so please 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.140
 gg I reject this this idea of 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.730
 suicide that does not suit me with this 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.019
 notion that the plane have a stole 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.880
 for seven hours then we push back 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.650
 a lot of things that leads us where that 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.570
 leads us between the west coast of 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.700
 australia and the kerguelen it's up to 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.480
 to say in the absolute nothing is nothing 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.340
 from the south 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.560
 why he's going to get in there there 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.920
 so we are several people to 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.780
 think of the e3 solution of course a 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.250
 hijacking what are these suicides on 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.290
 just push him away the second thing 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.940
 it's the currency of exchange is this 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.530
 that he knows how to pose somewhere one is 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.299
 practically certain a year they have 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.610
 posed nowhere what's left 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.890
 it remains on September 11, that is to say 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.680
 want to tackle something 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:35.519
 iconic United States where I do not 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.560
 do not know who to try to do between 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.450
 which is in quotation marks the buzz 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.700
 Here it but expect it mean 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.170
 clearly that he could have been hijacked by 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.850
 people who were embarked by 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.180
 passengers they took control of 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.980
 the plane 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.360
 but to go swing on what 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.459
 since there is nothing there in the big 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.900
 This is an extremely important base 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.850
 in the east several to think since the 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.100
 start at the famous base of diego garcia 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.920
 which is the most important basis in 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:02.519
 outside the united states super secret base 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.110
 with that planes that were flown over 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.730
 afghanistan a certain time like 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.070
 you know it's a base on 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.720
 which there are catches of 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.359
 prisoners that we do not want to put in 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.630
 guantanamo between terrorists 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:14.220
 Islamists 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.660
 it's a base on which the weaponry 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.880
 nuclear it is an extremely basic 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.549
 important for info point for mation 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.560
 an island that belongs to the British and 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.190
 which is rented to Americans since 39 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.750
 45 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.330
 so let's hear jean serrat 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.550
 that the avs 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.650
 we could have had it as a destination 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.360
 for 6 spit and that Americans do not 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.310
 theirs went down why not if we are 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.789
 many to think that yes it's the 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.680
 only the only plausible explanation that 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:39.759
 we have in mind right now what 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.139
 what else can there be 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:42.699
 there may be a fight on board 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:45.039
 remember the four planes that have 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:47.080
 been diverted from September you remember 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:48.849
 who has passengers who are rebelled to 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.009
 board and the plane crashed the vanni 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:54.159
 So here it is again possible 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:55.719
 but that means that whatever it is 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:59.349
 even if that's what it means 

00:04:55.719 --> 00:05:00.940
 the plane was going towards a goal between 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:02.680
 quotes the mass leaders the heart 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.629
 so that's good why americans 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.520
 if they took it down to protect themselves 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:07.870
 do not say it to suppose that he is 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.460
 down 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.960
 remember the Korean we learned 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.580
 fifteen years later what happened 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.770
 there was a boeing of the choir that has 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.509
 been descended descendant soviet 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.460
 south of sakhaline island 

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:19.690
 we learned 15 years after the Japanese 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.279
 have followed this live 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.930
 we learned 15 years later that there was 

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:25.509
 two planes that coke and accompany 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.860
 this plane maybe that in 15 years will be 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:28.479
 what happened on the 300 matches 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.740
 are ten a last question jean 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:31.479
 Serrat we learned this morning that 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.639
 close to the victims of this plane 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:35.949
 proposes $ 5 million for all 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:38.289
 information leading the truth you believe 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:39.909
 a miracle witness will manifest 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:41.889
 listen we even had a person on a 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:44.860
 boat that come tells us that there is 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:47.500
 of water less she saw a flame in the 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.360
 sky and then a plane fall into the 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.669
 good bay of Bengal everything is possible 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.650
 hope that the 5 million phase 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:55.000
 triggers and answers that we 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.589
 we all look forward to it 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.900
 in any case thank you for your clarification 

00:05:56.589 --> 00:06:00.669
 the morning on rtl jean serra old 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.990
 airline pilot now expert in 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:02.860
 aviation accidents I wish you 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:07.050
 an excellent Sunday 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.050
 thank you very much find this interview
