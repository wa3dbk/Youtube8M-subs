00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.570
 in all I'm a cookie and today 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:15.250
 let's talk about the new 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.960
 leaks that there have been leaks 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.730
 by those users who are 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.349
 judging and algete to 5 for the version 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.390
 next since catches of 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.369
 screen have even made streaming without 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.839
 play four and I'm sure a lot of 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.880
 the things that I am going to comment not the 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:29.439
 you have seen so let's go to it we go 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.720
 to start with the improvements that are going to 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.040
 can do in vehicles without 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.540
 probably these and the 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.800
 known some of them that in what 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.510
 first that you will have noticed 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.920
 surely that opens you more attention are 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.960
 the neons that are going to be able to add to 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.030
 the cars now on a neon axis 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.470
 are these colorful lights are already red 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.660
 blue whatever the color is that 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.520
 illuminate the bottom of the floor the 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.800
 road in this case but not only are 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.150
 these improvements because we can also see 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.450
 in the case of the environment that has 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.920
 connection plate hears he did not have it 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.900
 so this gives us the possibility of 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.340
 think that there may be even more improvements 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.750
 in the next generation although I read 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.160
 by someone who has already played the 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.659
 new generation saying that so 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.340
 less of that environment had no more 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.560
 improvements or had not seen them 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.149
 but continuing on the theme of cars 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.009
 Ros back out at the social club 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:13.990
 vehicles that will be next in the 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.630
 most are already if they are not all 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.399
 are already 750 I bet two of 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.619
 they the advertising textures these 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:23.770
 it was said that they will go out among them 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.600
 the franklin buffalo who is very handsome 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.250
 with this advertising is soon the drink 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.810
 is at the moment we are going to leave aside 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.090
 the vehicles and let's focus on 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.299
 something else that would be my second has 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.579
 commented this player the mixer we are going 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:39.250
 to give the option to choose the style or 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:41.739
 type of walking between which the player 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.579
 highlights the gangsters mode I do not know 

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:47.210
 exactly how it will be but you can walk 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.850
 among other types 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.830
 we go back to the vehicles this time with 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.570
 no monster truck they said they're going 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.909
 to put that as you see in the image has 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.920
 a flag of the USA but according to this 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.390
 player we will be able to change the flag 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.580
 and put the one we want not in the 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.200
 liberating but in this the vrac is worth 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.360
 we will be able to put the flags of the 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.979
 countries like we could be the parachutes 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.140
 and then another thing that this player 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.300
 highlights is that when I was playing in 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.730
 online I saw some people as a 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.470
 transparent medium plan such as in the 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.780
 careers these and then this has 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.069
 led to think that in nexgen is going to 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.110
 can activate the passive mode in 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.970
 vehicles so they can not kill you 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.830
 with c4 just as it was now 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.540
 that when they rode in a vehicle I'm going to 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.670
 kill then now with the mode 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.350
 passive we can go as striped 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.720
 transparent there is no one 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.489
 can kill and we go to some images 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.050
 that at first they believed that 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.670
 could be related to the 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.010
 red bank robberies as well as 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.750
 our posters that you wear when today 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.700
 you have arrested whatever it is but that 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.470
 rockstar the other day took a picture of 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.510
 these in which it was clearly seen that 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.830
 was to create the character or for 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.989
 modify it when we do the 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.370
 transfer from play 3 to play 4 and 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.870
 related to this are the images 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.030
 that have come from him 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.799
 when there is oil to 5 for a next 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.420
 generation in which above all it fits 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.040
 highlight the girl who is down to the 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.450
 left that if we can not let a 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.549
 new type of makeup these hearts 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.620
 this makeup in the black eyes and 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.000
 especially look at the red eyes that 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.980
 they have to look like we 're going to be able to 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.530
 put our character or reds 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.170
 or something like zombie plan let's hit 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.720
 the controls of the first and 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.430
 third person of gta 1 that as 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.840
 we can see in the settings menu now 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.970
 we can choose then to put the first 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.060
 third person person a version 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.680
 hybrid in which when we are playing 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.150
 this first person when we cover ourselves 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.310
 get in third and now we're going to 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.920
 other images filtered in the crypts 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.890
 we can see that rockstar is going to give 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.840
 little more dynamism to the gta houses 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.400
 in which we are going to be able to see then darts 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.650
 that they will probably be able to play 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.569
 washing machines that can really serve 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.310
 to wash the blood that we have in the 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.510
 clothes or whatever and then some 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.760
 image of the interior of the vehicles 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.659
 seen in first person vehicles that 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.920
 have not come out until now that 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:53.450
 example is the police car that the 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.030
 true that it is my interior because it is curious 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.260
 and if you want to see more interior is that 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.030
 there were no moments on screen for the 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.590
 you have a description in cats you can 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.879
 see them and then nothing up here 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.920
 I hope you liked it if it's like that 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:07.629
 leave me a like to follow me on twitter 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.629
 and see you in the next video
