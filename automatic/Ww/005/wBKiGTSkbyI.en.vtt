00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.189
 questions that is such a bolt logical 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.230
 video like many blogger me of course 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.960
 do a lot of questions but 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.840
 answer them all for all of them of course 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.940
 not really here but sometimes there are questions 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.040
 really very interesting and like this 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.950
 in a nutshell in the comments this of course 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.620
 it would even hurt so if you 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.180
 do you have any questions for me 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.489
 interesting then leave them under it 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.980
 video because i plan to create 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.079
 separate video question-answer and answer 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.480
 the most interesting answer 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.399
 deployed not in two words that's why 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.059
 sure to write whether you have something 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.890
 interested in 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.039
 also a long time there was no video on my channel 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.489
 conversational genre here I honestly 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.710
 section confused and the one and the other 5 10 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.540
 Everything is interesting which topic to choose and 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.220
 therefore not decided on your shoulders 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.450
 shift all responsibility write 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.680
 please video if you are interested 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.590
 some topic 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.070
 so that I have to speculate on this very topic 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.110
 here you must write it I will choose 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.420
 the most interesting or the one that picks up 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.460
 Most likes here and we on 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.570
 this topic let's talk topic topic topic topic 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:31.470
 53 lotto times I will take a review on cosmetics 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.270
 Kick I got laid out to you 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.509
 Instagram photo 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.640
 excellent manicures 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.100
 Generally cosmetics certainly deserve 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.000
 I'll tell you in more detail 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:48.240
 I will tell in more detail below the list 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.610
 I want to tell you about my palettes 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.930
 natural shades that I really 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.840
 loved lately 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.560
 here are not many of them but still think 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.810
 which makes sense to tell about them also 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.390
 recently began to use lipstick 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.030
 what I didn't do for a very long time with me 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.190
 maybe there was some kind of fudge but 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.819
 special and did not use you know that I 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.859
 straight fan 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.659

 I have a couple of pencils of pockets too 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.859
 a hundred years have not been done because again 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:22.480
 the same shine shine sum up a pencil to me 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:26.170
 I do not like how it looks so 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.719

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.849

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.560
 that we have here yet 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.959
 I got a package with cosmetics 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.989
 Ayurveda was interesting to me of course 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.560
 meet what is it different from 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:01.329
 simple cosmetics say so too 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.459
 some interesting products were 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:05.379
 again about all of this review of course 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.629
 will be given away and I plan to tell you 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:10.359
 about beauty boxes from israel when me 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:12.010
 and suggested I thought about this something 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:15.639
 brand new probably it will be a product of 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.979
 Israel but it turned out that this is not so 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:21.250
 my only one is one remedy there 

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:23.109
 israeli everything else is just simple 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.509
 cosmetics let's say here but there too 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:28.329
 there were interesting positions I will tell you 

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:31.139
 I'm also waiting for the parcel let's say this with 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:33.280
 youtube hits no other name I 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:35.319
 often seen these products very 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.659
 I have long wanted to try to see sense in 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.819
 reviews of our bloggers 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:42.359
 it and the palette slick that but I wanted 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:45.759
 try what it is and balm 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:47.709
 carmex and beautiful blender but original 

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:50.169
 I have no beauty lender 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.400
 the original ones I bought on ebay 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:54.159
 I want to compare 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.500
 are they really different there 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:58.180
 some positions are waiting right here with 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.549
 great looking I was certainly very 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.409
 surprised at one in one 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.800
 online store collected but I think 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:08.480
 that specially collected after all and 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:11.810
 hits youtube and then what more than once and not two 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.940
 it was said that according to bloggers 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.070
 deserves attention here I want too 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.079
 try what kind of wonder products 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.840
 very often the question comes to me 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:24.650
 regarding make-up take one or the other 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:27.950
 make-up honestly why don't i do 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.720
 them often because i know that in any 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.850
 If you are waiting for something new, that is 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.590
 if the blogger does makeup what will it be 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.310
 I will tell you something new and interesting 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.840
 honestly I have nothing to show you 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.760
 there are two schemes and lately 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.560
 in general , I use only one 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.010
 the most beloved 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.340
 and I only change now 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.860
 shades because I really love 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.900
 natural shades are now loved here 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.610
 only the texture of the shadows themselves changes 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.260
 palettes if you are still in such 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.210
 format interesting to see let's say 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:04.760
 how does this palette look like or how 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:06.919
 another palette looks like it looks at 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.500
 i use and let's say 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:12.410
 thought for a moment here is literally 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:16.100
 Of course, then again, write everything under 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:18.500

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:21.200

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.229
 I will not show, but of course I will continue my 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.780
 the story about the care cosmetics tell 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:29.060
 you about cleansing and have a mask like 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.430
 and promised all this of course will also 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:34.760
 I am waiting for you, of course, waiting for my story about 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.770
 shopping about some of my finds in 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.570
 areas of decorative cosmetics 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.729
 that is, about all this I will continue 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:42.470

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:46.100

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:49.940
 questions for my video answer question and 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:53.150
 bolt requests logical video about what 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.919
 you would be interested to hear and in general 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.330

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:58.940
