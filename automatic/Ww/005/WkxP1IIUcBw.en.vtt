two styles there's the three light and

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.499 
two styles there's the three light and
also<00:01:11.270> the<00:01:11.659> five<00:01:11.899> light<00:01:12.170> and<00:01:13.149> they<00:01:14.149> come<00:01:14.390> in

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
white and green these are for dry

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.389 
white and green these are for dry
applications<00:01:18.110> so<00:01:18.470> they're<00:01:18.590> not<00:01:18.740> submersible

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:19.399 
applications so they're not submersible

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:21.789 
applications so they're not submersible
they<00:01:20.090> have<00:01:20.270> an<00:01:20.390> eight<00:01:20.630> hour<00:01:20.930> battery<00:01:21.200> life<00:01:21.470> and

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
they have an eight hour battery life and

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:24.370 
they have an eight hour battery life and
they're<00:01:22.220> disposable<00:01:22.689> the<00:01:23.689> other<00:01:23.840> great<00:01:24.140> thing

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
they're disposable the other great thing

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.520 
they're disposable the other great thing
is<00:01:24.560> the<00:01:24.890> on/off<00:01:25.399> switch<00:01:25.850> which<00:01:26.200> allows<00:01:27.200> us<00:01:27.409> to

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
is the on/off switch which allows us to

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.399 
is the on/off switch which allows us to
turn<00:01:27.710> them<00:01:27.890> on<00:01:28.009> and<00:01:28.399> off<00:01:28.610> now

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
turn them on and off now

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.980 
turn them on and off now
the<00:01:30.619> original<00:01:31.070> idea<00:01:31.490> behind<00:01:31.850> the<00:01:32.060> C<00:01:32.270> light<00:01:32.479> was

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
the original idea behind the C light was

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.180 
the original idea behind the C light was
that<00:01:33.020> it<00:01:33.200> could<00:01:33.319> be<00:01:33.409> concealed<00:01:33.920> inside

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
that it could be concealed inside

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.169 
that it could be concealed inside
bouquets<00:01:34.850> or<00:01:35.240> boutonnieres<00:01:36.140> corsages<00:01:37.179> but

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:38.179 
bouquets or boutonnieres corsages but

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:40.389 
bouquets or boutonnieres corsages but
then<00:01:38.420> we<00:01:38.600> realized<00:01:39.080> that<00:01:39.380> it<00:01:39.709> also<00:01:39.979> could<00:01:40.369> be

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
then we realized that it also could be

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.600 
then we realized that it also could be
used<00:01:40.549> as<00:01:41.060> an<00:01:41.420> accent<00:01:41.929> inside<00:01:42.890> something<00:01:43.310> so

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
used as an accent inside something so

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.760 
used as an accent inside something so
now<00:01:43.880> they'll<00:01:44.509> be<00:01:44.569> coming<00:01:44.929> in<00:01:45.049> metallic<00:01:45.470> colors

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
now they'll be coming in metallic colors

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:46.440 
now they'll be coming in metallic colors
as<00:01:45.950> well

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
as well

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.270 
as well

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
currently the LED lights on the C lights

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.510 
currently the LED lights on the C lights
come<00:01:49.880> in<00:01:50.000> white<00:01:50.560> they're<00:01:51.560> packed<00:01:51.860> in<00:01:51.979> a<00:01:52.069> box<00:01:52.100> of

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
the different lights in the directions

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.470

that<00:04:21.040> I<00:04:21.160> want<00:04:21.570> to<00:04:22.570> form<00:04:22.870> a<00:04:23.080> corsage<00:04:23.500> shape<00:04:24.480> I'll

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
that I want to form a corsage shape I'll

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.620 
that I want to form a corsage shape I'll
turn<00:04:25.870> on<00:04:25.900> the<00:04:26.050> lights<00:04:26.380> while<00:04:27.090> I'm<00:04:28.090> creating<00:04:28.510> it

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
turn on the lights while I'm creating it

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.720 
turn on the lights while I'm creating it
so<00:04:28.660> I<00:04:28.840> know<00:04:28.930> exactly<00:04:29.280> where<00:04:30.280> they're<00:04:30.460> going<00:04:30.640> to

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
so I know exactly where they're going to

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.130 
so I know exactly where they're going to
go<00:04:32.010> the<00:04:33.010> backing<00:04:33.550> can<00:04:34.390> be<00:04:34.510> adhered<00:04:34.840> to<00:04:34.900> with

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
go the backing can be adhered to with

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.530 
go the backing can be adhered to with
hot<00:04:35.380> glue<00:04:35.620> or<00:04:35.770> cold<00:04:36.100> glue<00:04:36.340> I<00:04:36.640> like<00:04:37.300> that

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
hot glue or cold glue I like that

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.330 
hot glue or cold glue I like that
because<00:04:37.810> generally<00:04:38.350> I<00:04:38.380> might<00:04:38.740> want<00:04:38.950> to<00:04:39.040> glue

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
because generally I might want to glue

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.480 
because generally I might want to glue
in<00:04:39.550> sequins<00:04:40.240> or<00:04:40.810> other<00:04:41.200> assorted<00:04:41.770> things<00:04:41.800> with
