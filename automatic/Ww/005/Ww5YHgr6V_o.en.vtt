00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:10.110
 sony jumped on the 4k train 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.960
 and presented with the sony fx1 the 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.170
 first camcorder in the consumer camp 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.480
 4k so can record four times hd 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.430
 We have the device once more accurate 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.010
 looked at and tried in practice 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.400
 if the camcorder promise its 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.400
 can hold 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.150
 Already at first glance one notices 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.590
 that the device is not exactly ghost 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.270
 with switches and buttons 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.290
 For example, here we have seven available 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.739
 assignable keys to a three-stage 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.539
 nd filter settings to manual 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.640
 focus or autofocus on an audio commutes 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:50.329
 where you can also manually tone the sound here 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.010
 can regulate as well as the entrances 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.820
 on the top of the camcorder is 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.410
 under the hinged 3 5 inch display 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.809
 Panel attached with many buttons 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.910
 and controls with which you can 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.510
 make entire menu settings 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.110
 can view as well as recorded eclipse 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.260
 can let 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.380
 there is a sharpness here in front 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.290
 dazzle and zoomring and on the 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.360
 top an adjustable zoom rocker 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.979
 which is really handy if you are 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.250
 want to operate the camcorder on the handle 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:28.020
 and a second zoom rocker on the side 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.290
 if you have the camcorder for a long time without 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.610
 used tripod you will find that 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:36.500
 you have quite a chunk in your hand 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.509
 So it has about three kilograms and therefore 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.659
 it is recommended the camcorder on the 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.189
 Tripod to use 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.899
 when testing the car quality is us 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.180
 no negative point noticed 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.920
 to the menu you can say that sony 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.509
 here for a rational menu structure 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.509
 decided without colorful pictures 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.750
 interesting in the evaluation of this 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.090
 camcorders is the comparatively 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.460
 small teeth from image sensor of one 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.079
 very high depth of field produces like 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.990
 it is synonymous of normal full hd 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.420
 camcorder 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.970
 the x1 delivers with its four cables 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.740
 very sharp very small video picture 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.810
 but can not do with the color brilliance 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.069
 a video dr 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.510
 for example, the 5d mark 3 keep up 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.000
 But you also have the recording purpose in the 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.680
 Keep eye for reportage 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.230
 is a camcorder still better 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.500
 suitable because these are usually better 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.590
 and faster autofocus offer 1 video 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.170
 dss what at fourfold hd or 4k 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.420
 especially striking are objective 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.940
 sometimes they weaken to this 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.290
 Color spaces can lead the recognized 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.290
 can occur in the picture 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.680
 the 4k resolution and the very high 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.780
 Data rates up to 150 megabits per 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.090
 Seconds can not be about it 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.220
 hide that in low light use 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.550
 the camcorder comes to its limits or 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:06.480
 the small picture sensor is noticeable 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.890
 makes in good light conditions 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.810
 to notice this less 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.019
 here is the noise still in the 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.019
 frame 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.370
 We also noticed that 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.460
 really do not focus at 4k 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.410
 Children's game is on the small 3 5 inches 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.370
 Display is the focus point very much 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.170
 hard to find 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.420
 but here for most 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.080
 use of the autofocus well in the 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.080
 jump break 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:42.080
 who believes this bolide takes 4k here 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.430
 on sd-cards on the sony puts 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.130
 on his ex coach 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.380
 memory card formats is even there 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.780
 a sd card slot available but 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.670
 only for updates can be used 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.820
 not for the video recording 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.920
 even fast sd cards would be in there 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.020
 the situation is the high data rates of 100 50 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.400
 megabits per second to lift what 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.330
 about 19 megabytes per second 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:08.630
 corresponds to a expo.de map with 32 gb 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:11.150
 storage costs currently around 150 euros 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:14.450
 what concerns the recording codec 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.310
 sony on his xa vcs codec itself 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.910
 on a current and powerful 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.730
 calculator 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.680
 Quickly and quickly import the 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:24.200
 Import process does not take longer than 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.880
 with normal full hd photo at 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.669
 cut with a powerful and 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.070
 current computer, we could no 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.200
 Restrictions determine the material 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.890
 was fine without further problems 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.220
 to edit 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:40.340
 the fdr x1 convinces as the first 4k 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.470
 camcorder with its high sharpness and 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.370
 his recordings quadruple hd with 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:48.320
 50 or 60 frames per second to external 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.930
 he has everything 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.120
 a cameraman wishes only in the low 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.810
 light area pushes the device to his 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.300
 border 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.880
 because here is the competition from the 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:04.000
 stock the video dss with big ones 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.000
 image sensors and interchangeable lenses
