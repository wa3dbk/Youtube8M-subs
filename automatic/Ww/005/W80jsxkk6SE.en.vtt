00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.670 

from<00:00:00.480> the<00:00:00.630> initial<00:00:01.020> stage<00:00:01.319> of<00:00:01.530> this

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680 
from the initial stage of this

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.280 
from the initial stage of this
development<00:00:02.159> our<00:00:02.689> intention<00:00:03.689> was<00:00:03.780> to<00:00:03.840> replace

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
development our intention was to replace

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.320 
development our intention was to replace
the<00:00:04.410> physics<00:00:05.009> engines<00:00:05.370> our<00:00:05.930> that's<00:00:07.580> by<00:00:08.580> a<00:00:08.880> much

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
the physics engines our that's by a much

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.509 
the physics engines our that's by a much
smaller<00:00:09.719> displacement<00:00:10.160> turbocharged<00:00:11.160> engine

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
smaller displacement turbocharged engine

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.660 
smaller displacement turbocharged engine
so<00:00:11.759> it<00:00:11.940> will<00:00:12.150> say<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.389> very<00:00:12.780> challenging<00:00:13.080> task

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:13.670 
so it will say a very challenging task

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.060 
so it will say a very challenging task
because<00:00:14.670> we<00:00:15.450> had<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.839> get<00:00:16.020> enough<00:00:16.770> performance

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
because we had to get enough performance

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.370 
because we had to get enough performance
to<00:00:17.640> replace<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.180> physics<00:00:18.539> engines<00:00:18.900> but

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
to replace the physics engines but

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.150 
to replace the physics engines but
improve<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.340> fuel<00:00:20.580> economy<00:00:20.820> dramatically<00:00:22.160> by

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
improve the fuel economy dramatically by

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.279 
improve the fuel economy dramatically by
downsizing<00:00:23.609> so<00:00:24.090> that<00:00:24.359> we<00:00:24.480> can<00:00:24.660> offer<00:00:24.810> the

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289

the<00:00:55.980> performance<00:00:56.250> fuel<00:00:56.910> economy<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.660> many

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
the performance fuel economy and many

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.529 
the performance fuel economy and many
more<00:00:58.370> minimize<00:00:59.370> damage<00:00:59.670> emissions<00:01:00.329> as<00:01:00.510> well

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
more minimize damage emissions as well

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.889 
more minimize damage emissions as well
and<00:01:00.930> we<00:01:01.440> have<00:01:01.590> applied<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:02.899> twin-scroll

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
and we have applied the twin-scroll

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.500 
and we have applied the twin-scroll
turbocharger<00:01:04.559> which<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.489> very<00:01:05.760> effective<00:01:06.030> to

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
turbocharger which is very effective to

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.960 
turbocharger which is very effective to
improve<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.350> performance<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:08.250> responsive

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
improve the performance and responsive

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.170 
improve the performance and responsive
tension<00:01:09.390> dramatically<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:11.010> we<00:01:11.159> can<00:01:11.400> have

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
tension dramatically so that we can have

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.030 
tension dramatically so that we can have
the<00:01:12.360> drivability<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.290> physics<00:01:13.680> engines

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
the drivability of the physics engines

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.010 
the drivability of the physics engines
and<00:01:14.369> twin<00:01:14.670> scroll<00:01:14.909> turbo<00:01:14.970> charger<00:01:15.509> there's<00:01:15.810> a

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
and twin scroll turbo charger there's a

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.830 
and twin scroll turbo charger there's a
sprit<00:01:16.380> wall<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:16.860> between<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.939> exhaust<00:01:18.330> passes

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
sprit wall in between the exhaust passes

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.620 
sprit wall in between the exhaust passes
up<00:01:18.990> our<00:01:19.259> one<00:01:19.979> four<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.369> two<00:01:20.880> three<00:01:21.150> cylinders

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
up our one four and two three cylinders

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.950 
up our one four and two three cylinders
so<00:01:22.170> we<00:01:22.380> can<00:01:22.939> minimize<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.270> interferences

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
so we can minimize the interferences

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.109 
so we can minimize the interferences
between<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.530> cylinders<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.729> exhaust

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
between the cylinders and the exhaust

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.870 
between the cylinders and the exhaust
interference<00:01:27.840> between<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.880> exhausting

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
interference between the exhausting

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.539 
interference between the exhausting
gases<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:30.689> in<00:01:30.810> this<00:01:30.960> way<00:01:31.140> we<00:01:31.350> can<00:01:31.560> reduce<00:01:32.009> the

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
gases so in this way we can reduce the

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.090 
gases so in this way we can reduce the
residual<00:01:33.420> gases<00:01:33.930> inside<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.619> combustion

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
residual gases inside the combustion

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.520 
residual gases inside the combustion
chamber<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.700> improve<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.810> combustion<00:01:37.170> and

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
chamber and improve the combustion and

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.280 
chamber and improve the combustion and
also<00:01:38.159> more<00:01:38.670> effectively<00:01:39.329> transfer<00:01:40.110> the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
also more effectively transfer the

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.069 
also more effectively transfer the
exhaust<00:01:40.650> energy<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.430> topping<00:01:41.880> turbine<00:01:42.869> of

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
exhaust energy to the topping turbine of

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.740 
exhaust energy to the topping turbine of
the<00:01:43.290> turbocharger<00:01:44.189> so<00:01:44.640> in<00:01:45.270> general<00:01:45.479> we<00:01:45.720> can

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
the turbocharger so in general we can

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.080 
the turbocharger so in general we can
not<00:01:46.380> just<00:01:46.619> improve<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.189> performance<00:01:47.700> but<00:01:47.939> we

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
not just improve the performance but we

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.819 
not just improve the performance but we
can<00:01:48.299> also<00:01:48.479> improve<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.110> response<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.680> the

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
can also improve the response of the

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.450 
can also improve the response of the
engine<00:01:50.360> so<00:01:51.360> by<00:01:51.930> up<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.140> about<00:01:52.439> 25<00:01:53.009> percent

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
engine so by up to about 25 percent

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.730 
engine so by up to about 25 percent
compared<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.149> conventional<00:01:55.020> single

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
compared to the conventional single

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.030 
compared to the conventional single
screw<00:01:55.950> turbochargers<00:01:56.610> they<00:01:56.759> say<00:01:57.030> are<00:01:57.270> very

screw turbochargers they say are very

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.520 
screw turbochargers they say are very
effective<00:01:59.040> device<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.729> improve

they are good driveability and

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.960 
they are good driveability and

the poster in there it reduces a lot of
frictions<00:03:05.690> I<00:03:05.840> saw<00:03:06.049> inside<00:03:06.440> the<00:03:07.340> engines<00:03:08.000> for

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
frictions I saw inside the engines for

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.100 
frictions I saw inside the engines for
example<00:03:08.870> you<00:03:08.989> don't<00:03:09.019> have<00:03:09.260> to<00:03:10.540> move<00:03:11.540> to

example you don't have to move to

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.530 
example you don't have to move to
additional<00:03:12.650> cylinders<00:03:13.100> and<00:03:13.940> you<00:03:14.180> don't<00:03:14.390> have

and this is also reduced a lot so the

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.620 
and this is also reduced a lot so the
weight<00:03:34.190> reduction<00:03:34.760> the<00:03:35.060> pumping<00:03:35.450> noise

attention<00:04:33.020> for<00:04:34.060> the<00:04:35.060> combustion<00:04:35.450> system

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
attention for the combustion system

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.980 
attention for the combustion system
engine<00:04:36.950> cooling<00:04:37.280> system<00:04:37.640> to<00:04:37.850> do<00:04:37.970> it<00:04:38.120> and<00:04:38.300> this

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
engine cooling system to do it and this

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.560 
engine cooling system to do it and this
is<00:04:39.230> a<00:04:39.410> are<00:04:39.950> very<00:04:40.220> important<00:04:40.700> feature<00:04:41.450> for

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
is a are very important feature for

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.630 
is a are very important feature for
customers<00:04:42.380> because<00:04:42.740> the<00:04:42.890> customers<00:04:43.370> can

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
customers because the customers can

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.690 
customers because the customers can
obtain<00:04:44.570> all<00:04:44.810> the<00:04:45.080> the<00:04:45.890> performance<00:04:46.430> of<00:04:46.610> this

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
obtain all the the performance of this

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.980 
obtain all the the performance of this
engine<00:04:47.120> by<00:04:47.480> just<00:04:47.780> using<00:04:48.020> them<00:04:48.410> under<00:04:49.040> the

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
engine by just using them under the

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.230 
engine by just using them under the
regular<00:04:50.990> gasoline
