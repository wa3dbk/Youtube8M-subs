00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
now come straight from the sidelines not

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.180 
now come straight from the sidelines not
the<00:00:45.360> booth<00:00:45.539> not<00:00:45.899> down<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.469> then<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.710> you

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
the booth not down and then to you

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.000 
the booth not down and then to you
does<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.270> help<00:00:48.450> tempo<00:00:48.930> more<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.469> like<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.739> I

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
does that help tempo more I like it I

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.439 
does that help tempo more I like it I
mean<00:00:50.399> but<00:00:50.730> if<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:50.879> go<00:00:50.969> back<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.180> even<00:00:51.329> the

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
mean but if you go back to even the

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.180 
mean but if you go back to even the
Cotton<00:00:51.690> Bowl<00:00:51.780> last<00:00:51.960> year<00:00:52.140> we<00:00:52.739> had<00:00:52.980> plays

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
Cotton Bowl last year we had plays

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.790 
Cotton Bowl last year we had plays
relayed<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.719> so<00:00:54.719> it's<00:00:55.199> just<00:00:55.289> all<00:00:55.440> depends<00:00:55.739> on

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
relayed in so it's just all depends on

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.680 
relayed in so it's just all depends on
how<00:00:55.949> how<00:00:56.399> how<00:00:56.760> fast<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.120> can<00:00:57.210> get<00:00:57.300> Mike<00:00:57.480> going

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
how how how fast I can get Mike going

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.840 
how how how fast I can get Mike going
how<00:00:57.899> much<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.170> can<00:00:58.230> push<00:00:58.469> his<00:00:58.620> tempo<00:00:58.949> but<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.699> but

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
how much I can push his tempo but I but

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.220 
how much I can push his tempo but I but
I<00:00:59.910> think<00:01:00.090> it'll<00:01:00.210> be<00:01:00.270> nice<00:01:00.449> just<00:01:00.780> bad<00:01:00.960> whatever

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
I think it'll be nice just bad whatever

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.380 
I think it'll be nice just bad whatever
he<00:01:01.410> thinks<00:01:01.590> whatever<00:01:01.859> he<00:01:02.039> sees<00:01:02.250> play<00:01:03.090> before

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
he thinks whatever he sees play before

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.030 
he thinks whatever he sees play before
whatever<00:01:03.570> he<00:01:03.750> might<00:01:04.379> be<00:01:04.530> thinking<00:01:04.830> he<00:01:04.920> can

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
whatever he might be thinking he can

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.230 
whatever he might be thinking he can
just<00:01:05.159> throw<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.309> out<00:01:05.430> there<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.729> we're

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
just throw it out there and we're

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.359
