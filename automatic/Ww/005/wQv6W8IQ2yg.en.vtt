hertz well we'll have to see this is
it's<00:04:22.840> still<00:04:23.169> really<00:04:23.710> early<00:04:23.860> to<00:04:24.310> tell<00:04:24.570> remember

it's still really early to tell remember
when<00:04:25.750> these<00:04:25.930> new<00:04:25.960> phones<00:04:26.380> come<00:04:26.620> out<00:04:26.770> with<00:04:26.949> new

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
when these new phones come out with new

processors<00:04:27.880> new<00:04:28.180> benchmark<00:04:28.750> tests<00:04:29.139> have<00:04:29.320> to

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
processors new benchmark tests have to

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:35.520 
processors new benchmark tests have to
be<00:04:30.510> arranged<00:04:31.510> and<00:04:31.720> organized<00:04:32.260> to<00:04:34.139> do<00:04:35.139> the<00:04:35.320> test

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
be arranged and organized to do the test

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.200 
be arranged and organized to do the test
correctly<00:04:35.889> because<00:04:36.220> a<00:04:36.400> lot<00:04:36.610> of<00:04:36.639> the<00:04:36.790> tests<00:04:37.090> out

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
correctly because a lot of the tests out

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.990 
correctly because a lot of the tests out
there<00:04:37.389> therefore<00:04:37.600> dual<00:04:38.139> core<00:04:38.500> and<00:04:38.889> when<00:04:39.880> you

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
there therefore dual core and when you

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.580 
there therefore dual core and when you
take<00:04:40.210> a<00:04:40.240> dual<00:04:40.540> core<00:04:40.750> test<00:04:40.990> and<00:04:41.169> you<00:04:41.229> put<00:04:41.410> it<00:04:41.500> on

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
take a dual core test and you put it on

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.560 
take a dual core test and you put it on
a<00:04:41.650> quad<00:04:42.100> core<00:04:42.370> it<00:04:42.639> doesn't<00:04:43.240> come<00:04:43.389> out<00:04:43.419> right

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
a quad core it doesn't come out right

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.260 
a quad core it doesn't come out right
same<00:04:44.380> thing<00:04:44.560> is<00:04:44.740> if<00:04:44.979> you<00:04:45.340> use<00:04:45.550> a<00:04:45.580> quad<00:04:46.030> core

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
same thing is if you use a quad core

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.360 
same thing is if you use a quad core
test<00:04:46.540> than<00:04:46.690> you<00:04:46.810> do<00:04:46.960> it<00:04:47.080> on<00:04:47.200> a<00:04:47.229> dual<00:04:47.500> core<00:04:47.770> does

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
test than you do it on a dual core does

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.600 
test than you do it on a dual core does
not<00:04:48.550> come<00:04:48.729> out<00:04:48.850> right<00:04:49.410> so<00:04:50.410> we'll<00:04:51.160> have<00:04:51.280> to<00:04:51.400> find

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
not come out right so we'll have to find

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.370 
not come out right so we'll have to find
out<00:04:51.760> what<00:04:52.030> kind<00:04:52.240> of<00:04:52.300> tests<00:04:52.540> they<00:04:52.660> used<00:04:52.690> on<00:04:53.200> this

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
out what kind of tests they used on this

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.080 
out what kind of tests they used on this
I<00:04:53.590> am<00:04:55.020> I'm<00:04:56.020> a<00:04:56.110> little<00:04:56.590> skeptical<00:04:57.130> about

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
I am I'm a little skeptical about

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.000 
I am I'm a little skeptical about
whether<00:04:58.419> or<00:04:59.110> not<00:04:59.290> it's<00:04:59.500> going<00:04:59.620> to<00:04:59.710> be<00:04:59.830> like

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010 
whether or not it's going to be like

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.520 
whether or not it's going to be like
that<00:05:00.660> other<00:05:01.660> things<00:05:02.020> that<00:05:02.169> we<00:05:02.260> heard<00:05:02.410> about

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
that other things that we heard about

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.070 
that other things that we heard about
the<00:05:02.710> galaxy<00:05:03.100> s4<00:05:03.400> will<00:05:03.639> be<00:05:03.760> that<00:05:04.000> it<00:05:04.150> has<00:05:04.389> a<00:05:04.419> four

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
the galaxy s4 will be that it has a four

the galaxy s4 will be that it has a four

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.930 

HTC<00:06:13.410> makes<00:06:14.410> me<00:06:14.650> laugh<00:06:14.920> I<00:06:15.220> mean<00:06:15.460> yeah<00:06:15.730> that

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
HTC makes me laugh I mean yeah that

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.080 
HTC makes me laugh I mean yeah that
looks<00:06:16.240> like<00:06:16.360> an<00:06:16.510> HTC<00:06:16.990> smartphone<00:06:17.790> water<00:06:18.790> than

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
looks like an HTC smartphone water than

looks like an HTC smartphone water than
life<00:06:19.270> right<00:06:19.570> I<00:06:19.780> mean<00:06:20.050> is<00:06:20.350> it<00:06:20.410> a<00:06:20.740> 5-inch<00:06:21.130> display

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:21.220 
life right I mean is it a 5-inch display

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:26.730
