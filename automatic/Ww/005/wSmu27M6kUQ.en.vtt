00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.930
 What kind of beauty does that region say? 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.550
 welcome to another video and 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.350
 not coming today is a great video 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.609
 tourism 5 where I'll show you 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:32.820
 the behavior of a car on the track 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:34.969
 dry on the track with rain is united is 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.879
 car I'm going to use a corvette 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:42.120
 zr1 year 2009 in a special edition of 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:46.860
 corvette c6 is a car of 650 horses 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.570
 with 1,500 kilograms and arrives at the fifth 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.160
 performance points a very nice car 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.039
 fast agile car 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.230
 it is a beauty traction car rear 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.870
 and I think I'll have some 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.690
 I work in the rain lane 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.750
 but I'll try to be the best that I 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.940
 I can but what are we going with the first 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.650
 dry track so we can see some time and 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.330
 then we were on top wet track 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.880
 and see the point difference of a total 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.880
 of beauty then that, there we go 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.380
 Good folks, we've been dead here. 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.380
 Sep 27 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.200
 the first track of suzuka 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.250
 it is 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.060
 it will be necessary 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.380
 Let's go later 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.830
 I felt the time difference 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.630
 a clue 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.100
 looked completely 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.430
 the vegetable 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.690
 I spoke to the car on the 16th. 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.690
 we were always 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.040
 with 10 t 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.670
 You will not have fallen in the night. 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:09.200
 It's a good Mercosur car. 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.200
 special in series the curve 16 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:19.480
 I do not have a car in size. 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.480
 everything is well held in the head 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.210
 Paulo 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.500
 we will check to reign 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.500
 even the son 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.550
 the result 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.610
 the hospital I think it's pretty cool, the people 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.069
 in this comparison and also a comparison 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.069
 how much time will each 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:54.230
 on the return of each one 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.230
 the result is already original 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.180
 Okay, it's very quiet here, a car. 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.540
 Cool was in the chair doing with the 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.540
 dad 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.390
 cool 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.020
 a pity and this is it 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.530
 ae 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.270
 like this 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.990
 good 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.990
 he made two and ten 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.630
 on the dry track when we go 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.350
 follow the death of the video sir 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.350
 advantage on the track 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.710
 let him do the same 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.879
 starting to succeed 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.489
 the size of the operation that was done was 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:59.150
 rain time is set 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:01.040
 Is it a major difference? 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.140
 we can still see 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.610
 that every agent totally the people 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:11.540
 winning and accuracy in faults 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:13.120
 looking like a mother who arrives right stay 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.900
 indifferent 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.900
 mine 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:23.450
 if she has a very realistic dignity 

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:23.450
 And you think you end up working. 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:33.160
 the case is already a few years 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:36.300
 alone but you do not feel 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.300
 the car from home 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.880
 the secret confronted him he well 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.580
 adherent to the rain that always showing 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.040
 a higher gear that does not 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.500
 deployment is on the top of the car 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.010
 happen 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.920
 in touch with the just victory an exit 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:57.310
 of his bizarre and ends up being very 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.310
 easy 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:09.020
 this is world war the rain is not that 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.060
 when we were second in this 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.060
 track curve so he did not do it 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:22.160
 very well 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.160
 if you really want 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:33.010
 if I want to warn him 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:36.840
 I asked to report the car very easily and 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.840
 even trampled car really looks like 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.300
 so much that you have to be careful 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.630
 in the curve outputs 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.920
 play higher than they prefer 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.920
 only half 52 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.570
 to try to reverse the decision 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.160
 good 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.980
 We lost a lot of time and now I'm 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.980
 19 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:06.020
 had arrived 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:14.420
 the difference in the total we have is one 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:17.450
 a way that is much more 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:19.840
 sanitary control is very easy to 

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:19.840
 to roll 

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:26.659
 but is complicated 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:37.980
 good we arrived at fifa with 43 time fruit 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:41.569
 Unipac quick calculation because it is the 

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:44.289
 33 seconds 

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:44.289
 after 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:51.060
 gives a certain look 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.060
 the galley story 

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:01.999
 even so Taliban 

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:07.280
 You like it then do not forget that 

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:10.040
 favorite liquid bet on education 

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:13.280
 if you watched and until now a good rock 

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:15.230
 in the comments butter beauty 

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.630
 err I repeat I hope you all have 

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:20.650
 liked until the next video spoke to 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:20.650
 collaboration was
