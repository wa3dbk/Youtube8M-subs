00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:20.570
 [Music] 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:25.119
 our body needs energy to 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:28.189
 work to move to be alive 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:31.230
 the source of this energy is taken from 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.360
 the foods that we eat 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.640
 our current lifestyle is not 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.370
 However, it leads us to consume food 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.890
 increasingly rich in calories at the same time 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.800
 that instead we do less exercise 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.700
 physical 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.960
 [Music] 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.660
 [Applause] 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.000
 overweight occurs then when 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.640
 there is a mismatch between calories 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.650
 what we consume and what we spend with 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.950
 our daily physical activity 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.950
 [Music] 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.060
 with the protein intake diet 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.280
 Protecting what we get is 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.100
 decrease the amount of calories that 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.690
 They provide us with sugars and fats 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.360
 keeping the proteins you need 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.159
 our body 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:22.289
 [Music] 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:24.240
 The ultimate goal is to consume 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:27.060
 reserves of fats without affecting 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.880
 absolute muscle mass all this 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:40.679
 it happens thanks to a metabolic process 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:43.170
 that is called mitosis, ketosis is a 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:44.939
 physiological process by which our 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.109
 body transforms stored fat 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.109
 in energy 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.340
 besides the ketone bodies are also 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.650
 those responsible for stimulating the part 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.229
 of the brain responsible for controlling the 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.930
 feeling of hunger what facilitates the 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.600
 diet follow-up 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.780

 [Music] 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.710
 and 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:13.110
 The protein diet consists of several 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.420
 phases in the first phases the 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.100
 restriction of sugars and fats and the 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.800
 consumption of high-value proteins 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.510
 biological is greater as it 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.880
 advances in the diet and always low 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.940
 medical control is producing a 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.430
 food re-education reintroducing 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.870
 all kinds of foods according to the guidelines 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.870
 which marks the rhythmonutrition 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.640
 [Music] 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.310
 and ritmonutrition is a concept 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.230
 created by laboratories ysonut and that 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.190
 applies the precepts of chronobiology 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.590
 to nutrition know not only that we should 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.570
 eat but also at what time to 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.820
 optimize the contribution of macro and 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.170
 micronutrients through the 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:03.490
 feeding and thus improve our health

 control of the feeling of hunger 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:17.400
 inevitable in other diets improvement of the 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:20.170
 flaccidity since the proteins are 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.390
 fundamentals in muscles and skin

 Ritmonutrition and reeducation

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.210
 protein diet cheer up to try it and

 Join the thousands of people who lived 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:43.410
 proven its effectiveness and you will gain in
