today<00:00:08.099> I'd<00:00:08.250> like<00:00:08.280> to<00:00:08.639> talk<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:08.849> bit<00:00:08.940> about<00:00:09.110> being

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
today I'd like to talk a bit about being

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.690 
today I'd like to talk a bit about being
triggered<00:00:10.469> by<00:00:10.620> that<00:00:10.950> feeling<00:00:11.340> of<00:00:11.460> fullness

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
triggered by that feeling of fullness

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.970 
triggered by that feeling of fullness
and<00:00:12.120> what<00:00:12.450> I<00:00:12.480> mean<00:00:12.660> by<00:00:12.780> that<00:00:12.809> is<00:00:13.139> when<00:00:13.799> you've

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
and what I mean by that is when you've

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.980 
and what I mean by that is when you've
eaten<00:00:14.219> a<00:00:14.429> meal<00:00:14.670> or<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.179> snack<00:00:15.690> that<00:00:15.900> you've

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
eaten a meal or a snack that you've

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.740 
eaten a meal or a snack that you've
planned<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.710> it's<00:00:16.859> you<00:00:17.220> know<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.820> good<00:00:18.119> size

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
planned and it's you know a good size

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.200 
planned and it's you know a good size
normal<00:00:19.289> size<00:00:19.500> but<00:00:20.310> you<00:00:20.400> feel<00:00:20.580> full<00:00:20.880> because

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
normal size but you feel full because

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.929 
normal size but you feel full because
your<00:00:21.330> stomach<00:00:21.510> isn't<00:00:21.930> used<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.519> eating<00:00:23.519> normal

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
your stomach isn't used to eating normal

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.990 
your stomach isn't used to eating normal
amounts<00:00:24.180> of<00:00:24.300> food<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.720> holding<00:00:25.080> it<00:00:25.199> in<00:00:25.350> and

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
amounts of food and holding it in and

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.250 
amounts of food and holding it in and
having<00:00:27.000> this<00:00:27.240> food<00:00:27.449> in<00:00:27.539> your<00:00:27.599> stomach<00:00:27.720> having

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
having this food in your stomach having

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.679 
having this food in your stomach having
thus<00:00:28.500> these<00:00:28.920> feelings<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.460> fullness<00:00:29.689> trigger

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
thus these feelings of fullness trigger

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.900 
thus these feelings of fullness trigger
you<00:00:30.900> into<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.349> binge<00:00:31.590> or<00:00:31.920> treating<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:32.730> to

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
you into a binge or treating you to

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.569 
you into a binge or treating you to
purge<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:34.170> used<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.500> get<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:34.829> all<00:00:35.160> the

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
purge and I used to get this all the

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.459 
purge and I used to get this all the
time<00:00:35.790> in<00:00:35.969> my<00:00:36.090> recovery<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.780> found<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.170> so

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
time in my recovery and I found it so

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.229 
time in my recovery and I found it so
frustrating<00:00:37.770> because<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.340> knew<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:38.610> in<00:00:39.000> order

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
frustrating because I knew that in order

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.080 
frustrating because I knew that in order
to<00:00:39.360> recover<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.719> had<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.230> eat<00:00:40.980> these<00:00:41.250> regular

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
to recover I had to eat these regular

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.090 
to recover I had to eat these regular
meals<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.570> snacks<00:00:42.719> but<00:00:43.260> each<00:00:43.469> time<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:43.890> ate<00:00:44.070> a

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
meals and snacks but each time I ate a

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.690 
meals and snacks but each time I ate a
normal<00:00:44.460> meal<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.879> just<00:00:45.149> felt<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:46.440> full<00:00:47.370> and

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700

normal meal I just felt so full and
bloated<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:49.200> remember<00:00:49.950> feeling

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
bloated and I remember feeling

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.299 
bloated and I remember feeling
disgusting<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.530> that<00:00:52.530> would<00:00:52.680> trigger<00:00:52.860> me<00:00:53.010> to

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
disgusting and that would trigger me to

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.029 
disgusting and that would trigger me to
to<00:00:53.699> go<00:00:53.850> oh<00:00:54.239> well<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:54.960> feel<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:55.500> disgusting

supposed to deal with this and so at

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.859 
supposed to deal with this and so at
first<00:01:41.009> when<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.490> just<00:01:41.880> felt<00:01:42.119> too<00:01:42.210> hard

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
first when it just felt too hard

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.929 
first when it just felt too hard
I<00:01:42.899> started<00:01:43.740> going<00:01:43.890> for<00:01:44.159> sleep<00:01:44.399> after<00:01:44.759> lunch

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
I started going for sleep after lunch

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.210 
I started going for sleep after lunch
because<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.659> was<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:46.140> way<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.710> found<00:01:47.070> that

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
because that was a way that I found that

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.889 
because that was a way that I found that
I<00:01:47.280> couldn't<00:01:47.670> deal<00:01:47.850> with<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.119> smallness<00:01:48.509> as<00:01:48.780> if

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
I couldn't deal with the smallness as if

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.350 
I couldn't deal with the smallness as if
I<00:01:48.960> just<00:01:49.140> went<00:01:49.320> for<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.530> sleep<00:01:49.799> for<00:01:50.610> an<00:01:50.729> hour<00:01:50.850> then

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
I just went for a sleep for an hour then

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.749 
I just went for a sleep for an hour then
I'd<00:01:51.479> wake<00:01:51.689> up<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:52.140> I'd<00:01:52.229> feel<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.950> lot<00:01:53.310> less<00:01:53.460> full

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
I'd wake up and I'd feel a lot less full

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.300 
I'd wake up and I'd feel a lot less full
a<00:01:53.790> lot<00:01:54.060> more<00:01:54.450> capable<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:55.079> carrying<00:01:55.860> on<00:01:56.159> with

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
a lot more capable of carrying on with
