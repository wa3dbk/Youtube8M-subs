00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.470 
ending was that it didn't make me mad
and<00:02:48.260> that<00:02:48.350> is<00:02:48.530> hard<00:02:48.800> for<00:02:49.100> dystopian<00:02:49.700> even

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
and that is hard for dystopian even

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.090 
and that is hard for dystopian even
though<00:02:50.570> this<00:02:50.690> is<00:02:50.870> i<00:02:51.019> classify<00:02:51.500> this<00:02:51.560> more<00:02:51.920> the

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
though this is i classify this more the

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.699 
though this is i classify this more the
dystopian<00:02:52.730> fantasy<00:02:52.880> sometimes<00:02:53.720> dystopian

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
dystopian fantasy sometimes dystopian

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.740 
dystopian fantasy sometimes dystopian
endings<00:02:55.040> are<00:02:55.190> not<00:02:55.220> good<00:02:55.640> I'm<00:02:56.090> thinking<00:02:56.480> of<00:02:56.600> all

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
endings are not good I'm thinking of all

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.080 
endings are not good I'm thinking of all
the<00:02:57.320> dystopian<00:02:57.890> endings<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:58.519> not<00:02:58.850> a<00:02:58.880> lot<00:02:59.030> of

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
the dystopian endings and not a lot of

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.030 
the dystopian endings and not a lot of
them<00:02:59.239> are<00:02:59.390> good<00:02:59.570> but<00:03:00.080> this<00:03:00.260> was<00:03:00.410> the<00:03:00.440> first<00:03:00.560> one

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
them are good but this was the first one

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.670 
them are good but this was the first one
where<00:03:01.370> I<00:03:01.400> felt<00:03:01.790> like<00:03:02.090> it<00:03:02.450> was<00:03:02.690> perfect<00:03:03.320> for<00:03:03.500> our

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
where I felt like it was perfect for our

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.920 
where I felt like it was perfect for our
characters<00:03:04.250> our<00:03:04.670> characters<00:03:05.150> got<00:03:05.630> closure

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
characters our characters got closure

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.949 
characters our characters got closure
our<00:03:06.290> characters<00:03:06.830> came<00:03:07.070> full<00:03:07.310> circle<00:03:07.340> and<00:03:07.959> not

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
our characters came full circle and not

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.540 
our characters came full circle and not
that<00:03:09.170> they<00:03:09.290> lived<00:03:09.560> happily<00:03:09.650> ever<00:03:10.070> after

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
that they lived happily ever after

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.479 
that they lived happily ever after
because<00:03:10.850> they<00:03:11.000> don't<00:03:11.239> but<00:03:11.870> I<00:03:12.260> just<00:03:12.920> felt<00:03:13.220> like

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
because they don't but I just felt like

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.670 
because they don't but I just felt like
it<00:03:13.550> was<00:03:13.820> such<00:03:14.060> a<00:03:14.090> good<00:03:14.450> ending<00:03:14.930> for<00:03:14.989> this<00:03:15.440> kind

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
it was such a good ending for this kind

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.380 
it was such a good ending for this kind
of<00:03:15.800> series<00:03:16.010> I'm<00:03:16.459> coming<00:03:16.820> in<00:03:16.910> at<00:03:17.000> number<00:03:17.120> one

like i might be in the minority of this

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.630 
like i might be in the minority of this
being<00:03:22.150> satisfying<00:03:23.150> endings<00:03:23.600> but<00:03:23.900> I<00:03:23.959> chose

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
being satisfying endings but I chose

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.340 
being satisfying endings but I chose

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
thing about this was i did go into it

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.390 
thing about this was i did go into it
knowing<00:03:29.930> that<00:03:30.170> not<00:03:30.500> a<00:03:30.560> lot<00:03:30.650> of<00:03:30.799> people<00:03:30.920> liked

first I didn't like the ending I was
just<00:04:09.440> like<00:04:09.590> what<00:04:09.859> that's<00:04:10.070> how<00:04:10.310> it's<00:04:10.489> going<00:04:10.640> to

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
just like what that's how it's going to

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.030 
just like what that's how it's going to
end<00:04:10.730> but<00:04:11.540> then<00:04:11.720> as<00:04:11.989> you<00:04:12.260> know<00:04:12.380> the<00:04:12.769> ending

marinated<00:04:13.700> in<00:04:13.820> my<00:04:14.000> brain<00:04:14.299> and<00:04:14.630> I<00:04:14.810> was<00:04:15.230> really

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
marinated in my brain and I was really

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.640 
marinated in my brain and I was really
thinking<00:04:15.650> about<00:04:15.890> it<00:04:16.039> I<00:04:16.400> realized<00:04:17.000> I<00:04:17.539> was<00:04:18.229> ok

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650

thinking about it I realized I was ok
with<00:04:18.680> the<00:04:19.010> ending<00:04:19.430> that's<00:04:19.789> why<00:04:20.090> this<00:04:20.660> is<00:04:20.870> my

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
with the ending that's why this is my

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.430
