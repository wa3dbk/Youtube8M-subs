00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
design on this but I know it's got a

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.040 
design on this but I know it's got a
little<00:00:47.070> bit<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.309> unique<00:00:47.489> it's<00:00:48.300> got<00:00:48.480> double

stubble<00:00:49.230> yeah<00:00:49.770> it's<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:50.010> twin<00:00:50.250> step<00:00:50.489> hull<00:00:50.730> and

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
stubble yeah it's a twin step hull and

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.380 
stubble yeah it's a twin step hull and
with<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.649> beam<00:00:52.879> obviously<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.000> need<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.270> be

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
with the beam obviously you need to be

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.770 
with the beam obviously you need to be
able<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.800> get<00:00:55.800> some<00:00:56.010> speed<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:57.180> twin<00:00:57.420> steps

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
able to get some speed so the twin steps

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.779 
able to get some speed so the twin steps
allows<00:00:58.140> air<00:00:58.440> underneath<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:59.039> hull<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.250> get<00:00:59.640> it

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
allows air underneath the hull to get it

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.549 
allows air underneath the hull to get it
going<00:01:00.059> faster<00:01:00.739> does<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.920> have<00:01:02.160> any

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
going faster does that have any

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.950 
going faster does that have any
beneficial<00:01:04.559> or<00:01:04.830> adverse<00:01:05.339> impact<00:01:05.880> on<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.420> like

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
beneficial or adverse impact on the like

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.359 
beneficial or adverse impact on the like
maneuverability<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.920> boat<00:01:08.070> at<00:01:08.220> those

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
maneuverability of the boat at those

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.700 
maneuverability of the boat at those
high<00:01:08.520> speeds<00:01:08.820> or<00:01:08.939> does<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.119> help<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.990> can<00:01:10.350> well

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
high speeds or does it help it can well

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.230 
high speeds or does it help it can well
at<00:01:10.830> high<00:01:10.979> speeds<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.580> gets<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.060> high

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
at high speeds it gets you to the high

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.530 
at high speeds it gets you to the high
speeds<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.810> can<00:01:13.020> have<00:01:13.260> adverse<00:01:14.299> effects<00:01:15.299> but

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
speeds it can have adverse effects but

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.929 
speeds it can have adverse effects but
the<00:01:15.720> way<00:01:15.810> our<00:01:16.110> boats<00:01:16.380> are<00:01:16.650> built<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.549> our

the way our boats are built and our
boats<00:01:18.119> are<00:01:18.240> designed<00:01:18.950> it<00:01:19.950> eliminates<00:01:20.700> those

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
boats are designed it eliminates those

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.999 
boats are designed it eliminates those
those<00:01:21.390> adverse<00:01:21.720> effects<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.259> other<00:01:22.500> steps<00:01:22.860> all

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
those adverse effects of other steps all

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.140 
those adverse effects of other steps all
boats<00:01:23.250> gotcha

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
boats gotcha
