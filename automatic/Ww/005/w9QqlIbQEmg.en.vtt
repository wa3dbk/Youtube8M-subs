object you'll be using to trace and it's

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.649 
object you'll be using to trace and it's
pretty<00:01:25.320> simple<00:01:25.650> trace<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.820> on<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.150> cork<00:01:27.450> and

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
pretty simple trace it on the cork and

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.140 
pretty simple trace it on the cork and
on<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.409> photo<00:01:28.619> so<00:01:29.070> after<00:01:29.400> you've<00:01:29.579> cut<00:01:29.790> out<00:01:29.939> the

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
on the photo so after you've cut out the

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.359 
on the photo so after you've cut out the
cork<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.960> photo<00:01:31.200> well<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.829> can<00:01:32.040> do<00:01:32.220> to

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
cork and the photo well you can do to

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.859 
cork and the photo well you can do to
make<00:01:32.549> sure<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.030> coaster<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.570> little

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
make sure that the coaster is a little

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.990 
make sure that the coaster is a little
sleeker<00:01:34.259> instead<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:34.979> just<00:01:35.250> having<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.700> cork

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
sleeker instead of just having the cork

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.719 
sleeker instead of just having the cork
is<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.900> get<00:01:37.110> some<00:01:37.350> sort<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.710> spray<00:01:38.040> paints<00:01:38.520> or

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
is to get some sort of spray paints or

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.480 
is to get some sort of spray paints or
paint<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.509> paint<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.530> cork<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.070> different

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
paint and paint the cork a different

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.969 
paint and paint the cork a different
color<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.060> it'll<00:01:42.659> kind<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.079> hide<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.710> fact

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
color and it'll kind of hide the fact

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.679 
color and it'll kind of hide the fact
that<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.250> was<00:01:44.340> doing<00:01:44.700> your<00:01:44.820> own<00:01:44.880> project<00:01:45.479> and

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
that it was doing your own project and

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.740 
that it was doing your own project and
it'll<00:01:45.869> make<00:01:46.020> them<00:01:46.140> really<00:01:46.680> awesome<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:48.360> next

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
it'll make them really awesome the next

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.690 
it'll make them really awesome the next
step<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.200> really<00:01:49.500> simple<00:01:49.950> all<00:01:50.340> you're<00:01:50.610> going

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
step is really simple all you're going

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.330 
step is really simple all you're going
to<00:01:50.759> do<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.270> get<00:01:51.570> your<00:01:51.750> adhesive<00:01:52.290> any<00:01:52.829> type<00:01:53.310> of

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
to do is get your adhesive any type of

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.910 
to do is get your adhesive any type of
glue<00:01:53.610> will<00:01:53.909> really<00:01:54.630> work<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:55.140> went<00:01:55.680> for<00:01:55.860> a

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
glue will really work I went for a

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.410 
glue will really work I went for a
little<00:01:56.070> extra<00:01:56.310> strength<00:01:56.850> because<00:01:57.149> I<00:01:57.270> would

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
little extra strength because I would

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.600 
little extra strength because I would
want<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.840> last<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.530> you're<00:01:59.460> going<00:01:59.549> to

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
want it to last and you're going to

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.069 
want it to last and you're going to
spread<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.119> on<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.600> cork<00:02:02.899> so<00:02:03.899> now<00:02:04.049> that

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
spread it on to the cork so now that

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
different shape and you can also make

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.890 
different shape and you can also make
the<00:02:39.100> photo<00:02:39.370> in<00:02:39.580> that<00:02:39.730> shape<00:02:40.000> too<00:02:40.270> it's<00:02:40.600> as

the photo in that shape too it's as
simple<00:02:41.080> as<00:02:41.410> making<00:02:41.950> it<00:02:42.220> a<00:02:42.310> heart<00:02:42.580> coaster

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150

making it a star coaster whatever you
can<00:02:45.820> think<00:02:45.880> of<00:02:46.300> it's<00:02:46.570> really<00:02:46.990> open<00:02:47.350> to<00:02:47.520> your

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
can think of it's really open to your

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.540 
can think of it's really open to your
creativity<00:02:52.530> so<00:02:53.530> once<00:02:53.770> you've<00:02:53.950> trimmed<00:02:54.220> up<00:02:54.370> all

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
creativity so once you've trimmed up all

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.970 
creativity so once you've trimmed up all
the<00:02:54.670> sides<00:02:54.910> you<00:02:55.360> have<00:02:55.540> pretty<00:02:56.200> much<00:02:56.320> a<00:02:56.470> coaster

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
the sides you have pretty much a coaster

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.680 
the sides you have pretty much a coaster
but<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:57.310> biggest<00:02:57.550> problem<00:02:58.120> about<00:02:58.480> this

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
but the biggest problem about this

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
coaster now is that if you put a cup on

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.300 
coaster now is that if you put a cup on
it<00:03:01.000> you<00:03:01.210> can<00:03:01.330> mess<00:03:01.540> up<00:03:01.570> the<00:03:01.810> photo<00:03:02.020> so<00:03:02.680> that<00:03:02.950> is

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
it you can mess up the photo so that is

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.630 
it you can mess up the photo so that is
what<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:03.850> varnish<00:03:04.180> is<00:03:04.360> form<00:03:04.660> and<00:03:05.490> number<00:03:06.490> one

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
almost glue versions that you would

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.320 
almost glue versions that you would
