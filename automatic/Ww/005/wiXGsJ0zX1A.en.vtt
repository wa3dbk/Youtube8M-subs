00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hi to all viewers and my followers 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:10.380
 channel with you sharks and today I will tell 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:13.559
 how to set up a fifa 14 camera to 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.470
 convenient to see both flank that look 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.980
 like mine here you just see the top 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.789
 the bottom bar and you can see absolutely 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.550
 well line 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:29.300
 defenders of the opponent and your line somehow 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.079
 set it up is very simple 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.430
 let's go into the game options and 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:40.100
 Camera setting here at my worth 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:43.079
 cooperative game called as camera 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.710
 before us in my joint camera 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.870
 was called well here on the background because 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:52.530
 you can see the last row of opponent defenders 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.870
 and you can see a little 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.969
 cool camera 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.829
 many play on cameras but see 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.600
 Let ka remember to give it 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.940
 cooperative camera as seen if i 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.860
 I put the camera then you will immediately understand 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.000
 the difference is not visible the last defenders 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.610
 my last is not visible 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.869
 defenders and the opponent can only be seen 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.970
 extreme but 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:22.189
 one central is not very convenient 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:26.100
 Do they sometimes even better when seen 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:29.100
 absolutely more and cast to do so 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.320
 it seems easier to me to make such 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.420
 the camera is not enough just to put 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.659
 co-op game still need to put 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.869
 here 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.299
 not by default, but you see it by 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.420
 default to the camera a little closer if you 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:46.920
 its stand and the position you 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:51.299
 hope for 10 scaling should at 0 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:56.009
 stand guys are a little sick therefore 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:59.450
 so I say through the nose and sometimes 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:02.759
 wrong words so guys here 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:06.060
 cooperative game remember yes why 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:09.119
 not the cameras you understood t in broadcast 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.950
 I do not know who plays on which of these 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.200
 cameras 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.030
 then broadcast wash some play up 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.790
 in my opinion this is broadcast some 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.450
 play but principle 9 is still bad 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:24.870
 seen on this camera is very cool 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.989
 play on tv broadcast even i think 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.690
 You can somehow set up the broadcast but 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:33.060
 all the same all the same I hold exactly 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.760
 cooperative camera all see if 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.110
 it is possible to play at such an angle 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.850
 yet somehow 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:43.019
 playable looks but you do not see 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:46.100
 bottom flank and somehow you know with this 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:53.070
 camera focus and concentration done 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:57.019
 so now I will try to score exactly 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:03:00.570
 concentration on the sword 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:03.209
 you don't pay much attention to the flank 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.280
 from this camera though it seems to me someone from 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.400
 professional floor hedgehog plays on tv 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:12.350
 broadcast can not be wrong but in my opinion 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:16.950
 He plays with this camera but I play 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:19.590
 on cooperative now put again 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.019
 cooperative can even leave here 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.920
 its so here on top but these so not so much 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:31.459
 when it is at a slightly different angle 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:36.060
 let's do that desyatochki and 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:40.710
 all here in the morning everything is visible all the field where 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:45.330
 who attacks where the opponent opens 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:46.470
 convenient to make counterattacks well, everything is simple 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.430
 you can see the whole field 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:52.250
 I think this is an ideal camera fifa 14 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.550
 We do not know the opinion of course can not 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:59.400
 coincides with yours but I advise you to put 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.260
 This camera you just do not even pay 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.350
 attention as you start to play much 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:08.040
 better you have a stake subscribe to 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:11.150
 channel like and up to the next 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.150
 video tutorials for now
