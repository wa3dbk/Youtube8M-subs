they<00:02:21.360> don't<00:02:21.630> fit<00:02:21.960> up<00:02:22.170> into<00:02:22.740> there<00:02:22.980> these<00:02:23.400> are

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
they don't fit up into there these are

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.000 
they don't fit up into there these are
behind<00:02:24.660> these<00:02:24.870> doors<00:02:24.930> are<00:02:25.440> actually<00:02:25.800> some

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
behind these doors are actually some

that<00:03:13.490> the<00:03:14.490> thing<00:03:14.700> is<00:03:14.810> I<00:03:15.810> wanted<00:03:16.530> to<00:03:16.620> have<00:03:16.800> dual

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
that the thing is I wanted to have dual

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.170 
that the thing is I wanted to have dual
monitors<00:03:18.120> but<00:03:19.020> well<00:03:19.620> obviously<00:03:19.950> with<00:03:20.489> one<00:03:20.730> DVI

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
monitors but well obviously with one DVI

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.320 
monitors but well obviously with one DVI
output<00:03:21.980> you<00:03:22.980> cannot<00:03:23.310> have<00:03:23.550> a<00:03:23.580> dual<00:03:23.850> monitor

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
output you cannot have a dual monitor

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.699 
output you cannot have a dual monitor
setup<00:03:24.420> can't<00:03:25.110> you<00:03:25.320> well<00:03:26.420> look<00:03:27.420> at<00:03:27.660> that<00:03:27.989> a<00:03:28.290> dual

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
setup can't you well look at that a dual

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.210 
setup can't you well look at that a dual
monitor<00:03:29.310> setup<00:03:29.720> so<00:03:30.720> how<00:03:30.900> did<00:03:30.959> I<00:03:31.200> do<00:03:31.260> that<00:03:31.410> well

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
monitor setup so how did I do that well

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.350 
monitor setup so how did I do that well
I<00:03:32.870> well<00:03:33.870> I<00:03:33.900> knew<00:03:34.260> that<00:03:34.520> DVI<00:03:35.520> was<00:03:35.940> somewhat

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
I well I knew that DVI was somewhat

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.280 
I well I knew that DVI was somewhat
comfortable<00:03:36.989> with<00:03:37.440> hdmi<00:03:38.400> so<00:03:39.330> I<00:03:39.660> looked<00:03:40.020> out

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
comfortable with hdmi so I looked out

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.420 
comfortable with hdmi so I looked out
how<00:03:40.590> to<00:03:40.650> look<00:03:40.830> at<00:03:40.980> ebay<00:03:41.130> and<00:03:41.640> I<00:03:42.150> found<00:03:42.750> out<00:03:42.930> that

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
how to look at ebay and I found out that

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.670 
how to look at ebay and I found out that
they<00:03:44.430> actually<00:03:44.670> do<00:03:45.360> have<00:03:46.610> hdmi<00:03:47.610> to<00:03:48.120> DVI

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
they actually do have hdmi to DVI

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.570 
they actually do have hdmi to DVI
adapters<00:03:49.680> so<00:03:50.670> I<00:03:50.730> ordered<00:03:51.209> one<00:03:51.420> of<00:03:51.690> those<00:03:51.870> and

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
adapters so I ordered one of those and

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.000 
adapters so I ordered one of those and
plugged<00:03:53.580> it<00:03:53.700> into<00:03:53.850> the<00:03:53.970> DVI<00:03:54.330> input<00:03:55.230> event

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
plugged it into the DVI input event

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.370 
plugged it into the DVI input event
samsung<00:03:56.910> monitor<00:03:57.239> all<00:03:57.360> right<00:03:57.510> there<00:03:57.780> once

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
samsung monitor all right there once

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.280 
samsung monitor all right there once
again<00:03:58.560> another<00:03:58.890> samson<00:03:59.580> product<00:04:00.030> that's<00:04:01.019> uh

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
again another samson product that's uh

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.199 
again another samson product that's uh
that's<00:04:01.709> no<00:04:02.130> good<00:04:03.290> anyway<00:04:04.910> plugged<00:04:05.910> it<00:04:06.060> into

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
that's no good anyway plugged it into

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.680 
that's no good anyway plugged it into
there<00:04:06.510> and<00:04:06.750> it<00:04:07.260> worked<00:04:07.739> and<00:04:08.190> I<00:04:09.060> I<00:04:09.090> was<00:04:09.510> not

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
there and it worked and I I was not

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.110 
there and it worked and I I was not
really<00:04:09.959> expecting<00:04:10.050> it<00:04:10.620> to<00:04:10.739> work<00:04:10.980> at<00:04:11.670> least<00:04:11.910> not

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
really expecting it to work at least not

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.849 
really expecting it to work at least not
in<00:04:12.330> this<00:04:12.480> way<00:04:12.750> because<00:04:14.690> well<00:04:15.690> it<00:04:16.019> that<00:04:16.650> really

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
in this way because well it that really

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.920 
in this way because well it that really
brings<00:04:17.190> up<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:17.459> question<00:04:17.489> why<00:04:18.209> didn't<00:04:18.750> they

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
brings up the question why didn't they

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.279 
brings up the question why didn't they
just<00:04:19.200> put<00:04:19.470> in<00:04:19.590> a<00:04:19.680> DVI<00:04:20.539> jack<00:04:21.539> and<00:04:21.840> in<00:04:22.020> place<00:04:22.260> of

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
just put in a DVI jack and in place of

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:25.610 
just put in a DVI jack and in place of
the<00:04:22.650> in<00:04:23.130> place<00:04:23.310> of<00:04:23.340> the<00:04:23.550> hdmi<00:04:24.320> because<00:04:25.320> you

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
the in place of the hdmi because you

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.990 
the in place of the hdmi because you
know<00:04:25.740> then<00:04:25.979> they<00:04:26.160> could<00:04:26.340> have

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
know then they could have

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.600 
know then they could have
they<00:04:27.300> would<00:04:27.480> have<00:04:27.570> had<00:04:27.750> a<00:04:28.340> another<00:04:29.340> feature

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
they would have had a another feature

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.310 
they would have had a another feature
that<00:04:29.850> they<00:04:30.000> could<00:04:30.300> have<00:04:30.330> advertised<00:04:30.990> you<00:04:31.230> know

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
that they could have advertised you know

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.790 
that they could have advertised you know
mule<00:04:31.650> T<00:04:31.800> screen<00:04:32.220> and<00:04:32.550> you<00:04:33.540> know<00:04:33.660> I<00:04:34.020> was

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
mule T screen and you know I was

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.400 
mule T screen and you know I was
expecting<00:04:35.250> that<00:04:35.880> the<00:04:36.150> hdmi<00:04:37.020> would<00:04:37.230> just

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
expecting that the hdmi would just

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.050 
expecting that the hdmi would just
output<00:04:37.770> the<00:04:37.890> same<00:04:38.160> as<00:04:38.430> a<00:04:38.490> DVI<00:04:39.330> and<00:04:40.850> so<00:04:41.850> getting

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
output the same as a DVI and so getting

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.400 
output the same as a DVI and so getting
the<00:04:42.270> adapter<00:04:42.690> was<00:04:42.840> really<00:04:43.110> just<00:04:43.260> an

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
the adapter was really just an

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.060 
the adapter was really just an
experiment<00:04:43.880> the<00:04:44.880> adapter<00:04:45.270> was<00:04:45.480> cheap<00:04:45.900> like<00:04:46.560> 20

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
experiment the adapter was cheap like 20

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.710 
experiment the adapter was cheap like 20

this one the picture is locked sharper

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.950 
this one the picture is locked sharper
