to a quick review of Minecraft 1.8 pre
Lee's<00:00:14.809> pre-release<00:00:15.809> 3<00:00:17.480> yep<00:00:18.480> yep<00:00:18.810> um<00:00:19.199> first

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
Lee's pre-release 3 yep yep um first

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.950 
Lee's pre-release 3 yep yep um first
we're<00:00:19.830> going<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.010> take<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.250> look<00:00:20.460> at<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.960> string

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
we're going to take a look at the string

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.939 
we're going to take a look at the string
bug<00:00:22.260> caused<00:00:23.100> by<00:00:23.580> up<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.420> down<00:00:24.630> moving<00:00:25.109> pistons

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
bug caused by up and down moving pistons

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.790 
bug caused by up and down moving pistons
with<00:00:26.730> this<00:00:27.359> kind<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.689> construction<00:00:28.230> on<00:00:28.470> top<00:00:28.650> of

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
with this kind of construction on top of

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.550 
with this kind of construction on top of
it<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:29.910> when<00:00:30.090> we<00:00:30.269> would<00:00:30.420> have<00:00:30.599> this

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
it so when we would have this

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.220 
it so when we would have this
construction<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.850> we<00:00:33.120> would<00:00:33.270> rapidly<00:00:33.570> I'll

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
construction and we would rapidly I'll

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.080 
construction and we would rapidly I'll
make<00:00:34.680> this<00:00:34.860> list<00:00:35.520> in<00:00:35.700> go<00:00:36.450> into<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:36.989> string<00:00:37.530> um

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
make this list in go into that string um

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.090 
make this list in go into that string um
yeah<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.210> would<00:00:39.360> cause<00:00:39.570> duplication<00:00:40.440> pretty

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
yeah it would cause duplication pretty

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.840 
yeah it would cause duplication pretty
useful<00:00:41.460> actually<00:00:41.850> but<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.570> know<00:00:43.230> not<00:00:43.440> not

while that's true yes um let's put some

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.880 
while that's true yes um let's put some
armor<00:01:23.700> stands<00:01:23.939> down<00:01:24.210> here

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.240 

we<00:01:30.890> can't<00:01:31.160> they<00:01:31.340> be<00:01:31.400> placed<00:01:32.270> anywhere<00:01:32.890> I<00:01:33.890> want

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
we can't they be placed anywhere I want

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.820 
we can't they be placed anywhere I want
that<00:01:34.700> should<00:01:34.910> be<00:01:35.000> possible<00:01:35.210> right<00:01:38.680> me<00:01:39.680> like

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
that should be possible right me like

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.470 
that should be possible right me like
come<00:01:40.070> on<00:01:42.430> when<00:01:43.430> there<00:01:43.580> are<00:01:43.730> blocks<00:01:44.090> you<00:01:44.330> can

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
come on when there are blocks you can

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.860 
come on when there are blocks you can
what<00:01:44.980> that<00:01:45.980> does<00:01:46.130> not<00:01:46.160> make<00:01:46.340> any<00:01:46.520> sense<00:01:47.000> well

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
what that does not make any sense well

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.600 
what that does not make any sense well
maybe<00:01:48.170> that's<00:01:48.470> the<00:01:48.650> bug<00:01:48.830> i<00:01:48.980> don't<00:01:49.160> know<00:01:49.250> but<00:01:49.460> at

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
maybe that's the bug i don't know but at

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.900 
maybe that's the bug i don't know but at
least<00:01:49.760> we<00:01:50.570> are<00:01:50.810> going<00:01:51.110> to<00:01:51.260> launch<00:01:51.620> a<00:01:51.980> minecart

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
least we are going to launch a minecart

00:01:52.910 --> 00:02:05.650 
least we are going to launch a minecart
with<00:01:53.150> tnt<00:01:59.290> kaboom<00:02:00.310> as<00:02:01.310> you<00:02:01.610> can<00:02:01.700> see<00:02:04.450> we<00:02:05.450> did

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
with tnt kaboom as you can see we did

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.109 
with tnt kaboom as you can see we did
not<00:02:05.810> get<00:02:06.020> the<00:02:06.320> armor<00:02:06.710> stands<00:02:06.950> back<00:02:07.160> which<00:02:07.910> is

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
not get the armor stands back which is

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.490 
not get the armor stands back which is
kind<00:02:08.360> of<00:02:08.450> unfortunate<00:02:08.570> because<00:02:09.140> i<00:02:09.320> had

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
kind of unfortunate because i had

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.790 
kind of unfortunate because i had
expected<00:02:09.950> it<00:02:10.190> to<00:02:10.570> give<00:02:11.570> me<00:02:11.720> back<00:02:11.900> at<00:02:12.080> least<00:02:12.320> one

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
expected it to give me back at least one

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.660 
expected it to give me back at least one
hour<00:02:12.920> to<00:02:13.130> armor<00:02:13.460> stands<00:02:13.700> but<00:02:13.940> it<00:02:14.060> doesn't<00:02:14.420> um

hour to armor stands but it doesn't um
but<00:02:16.670> at<00:02:16.760> least<00:02:16.910> it<00:02:17.120> does<00:02:17.300> not<00:02:17.420> duplicate<00:02:18.170> the

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
but at least it does not duplicate the

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.680 
but at least it does not duplicate the
armor<00:02:18.920> stands<00:02:19.250> anymore<00:02:19.640> and<00:02:19.880> that<00:02:20.450> was<00:02:20.660> the
