00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.830
 how many people from youtube welcome to a 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.660
 new tutorial where I'm going to teach them to 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.369
 how to delete the folder exist volume 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.960
 information that is generated 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.570
 automatically when connecting any 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.520
 memory to our computer before 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.390
 nothing I want to tell you that this tutorial 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.980
 is dedicated solely for windows 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.469
 8.1 and I think also at 8 I do not know if 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.440
 also work there since this folder 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:37.239
 is automatically generated by the system 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.789
 due to a rule that is saved and 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.280
 good not telling me with explanation today 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:45.280
 I'm going to teach them how to eliminate it and we're going 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.530
 to start now very well not to lose 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.649
 I have to write down the steps first 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.719
 we're going to do is going to run it 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:56.740
 we could continue going to the aleshin 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:59.930
 lower right click right and execute 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:05.840
 and we go to this address 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:09.520
 gp edit point m sc we enter and well what 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.100
 load we can wait a little bit 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.649
 very well once here the first thing that 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.530
 let's do is get into the next 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:19.750
 address first we go to where it says 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.789
 equipment configuration 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.840
 that would be good is already selected 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:28.090
 now we are going to templates 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.789
 administrative and then to components of 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.789
 windows and then search we go there 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.729
 windows components search search 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.709
 search search here are we select 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.929
 the folder and here we see a 

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:46.810
 list once here the first thing that 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:49.239
 we have to look for is the option that says 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.489
 do not allow libraries to be added 

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:54.159
 to locations in removable drives 

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:57.099
 very well now what we will do is give it 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.959
 double click on this option and once you 

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:01.060
 the first thing that we have to open up 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:02.979
 do is change the option to enabled 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.719
 this will do is not generate 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.179
 no folder assists in volume 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:09.729
 formation in our memories usb that 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:12.660
 let's connect and it would be everything 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.450
 we only give you apply and asia 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.580
 and well I'm going to teach them I'm going to 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.530
 show them how the result of 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.640
 this tutorial allow me so little 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.640
 while I connect the memory 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.750
 very good as you will see here I have what here 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.000
 I have the information of my memory and 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.770
 everything and here in hidden elements I have 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.410
 is saved in the folder exists in 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.260
 volume information and good before 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.240
 do something the only way to eliminate 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.970
 that folder in the memories already 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.800
 generated is formatting if what 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.020
 they want is to eliminate it from the partitions 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.840
 of your hard drive could use some 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:59.290
 some operating system like lupus or 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.130
 something like that and delete it out of windows 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.020
 to prevent form partitions 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.600
 very well before continuing I want to do 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.590
 a backup of my files that good 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.590
 I made this folder 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.600
 Let's see 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.020
 you want a backup of all my files 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.020
 here 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.780
 and good since I have backed this up 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.910
 what we are going to do is format this 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.340
 memory to completely eliminate what 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:30.770
 that there is already volume information 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.770
 text very well 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.819
 and we are going to format it quickly we are going 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.650
 to accept we wait for it to be finished 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.850
 format and once formatted in the 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.510
 folder will have disappeared completely 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.510
 one 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:54.500
 very well now I am going to teach you that 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.690
 is not this folder as you will see it activated and 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.470
 Deactivated the hidden items and did not 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:02.390
 appears and now knows expelled and I go back to 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.190
 put the memory 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:08.360
 I'm here now I reconnect 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:12.650
 we wait for the computer to 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:15.560
 detect and as you will see, the 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.060
 folder by nowhere and good people 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.919
 that would be all I hope there was 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.440
