workout and they will definitely make

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.090 
workout and they will definitely make
you<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.139> lot<00:00:16.619> stronger<00:00:17.630> the<00:00:18.630> traditional<00:00:19.590> form

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
and it's probably the most technically

the<00:01:20.850> top<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:22.020> shoulder<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.280> the

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
the top of the shoulder that is the

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.130 
the top of the shoulder that is the
opposite<00:01:24.450> one<00:01:24.689> from<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.290> one<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:26.009> are

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
opposite one from the one you are

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.490 
opposite one from the one you are
grasping<00:01:28.140> hands<00:01:28.409> with<00:01:28.650> her<00:01:28.740> wave

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.990 

actually<00:01:32.500> I<00:01:32.530> have<00:01:32.770> to<00:01:32.920> say<00:01:33.190> that<00:01:33.430> that<00:01:33.460> is<00:01:33.760> just

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
actually I have to say that that is just

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.960 
actually I have to say that that is just
a<00:01:34.180> really<00:01:34.540> cool-looking<00:01:35.200> move<00:01:36.040> and<00:01:36.370> it's

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
a really cool-looking move and it's

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.750 
a really cool-looking move and it's
actually<00:01:37.270> really<00:01:37.840> satisfying<00:01:38.530> to<00:01:38.830> just<00:01:38.860> pull

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
actually really satisfying to just pull

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.580 
actually really satisfying to just pull
someone<00:01:40.180> through<00:01:40.360> the<00:01:40.510> air<00:01:40.630> and<00:01:40.990> just<00:01:41.440> have

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
someone through the air and just have

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.680 
someone through the air and just have
them<00:01:41.680> slide<00:01:42.160> right<00:01:42.670> onto<00:01:43.090> your<00:01:43.120> shoulder<00:01:43.570> it's

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
them slide right onto your shoulder it's

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.820 
them slide right onto your shoulder it's
just<00:01:44.080> really<00:01:44.410> a<00:01:44.770> fun<00:01:45.130> thing<00:01:45.160> to<00:01:45.430> do<00:01:45.729> and<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:47.770> know

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
just really a fun thing to do and I know

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.770 
just really a fun thing to do and I know
that's<00:01:48.160> the<00:01:48.460> harder<00:01:48.850> move<00:01:49.030> so<00:01:49.330> here's<00:01:49.630> the

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
that's the harder move so here's the

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.180 
that's the harder move so here's the
easier<00:01:50.080> one<00:01:50.290> it's<00:01:50.470> just<00:01:50.560> a<00:01:50.710> matter<00:01:51.070> of

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
easier one it's just a matter of

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.920 
easier one it's just a matter of
squatting<00:01:51.729> down<00:01:51.880> and<00:01:51.940> having<00:01:52.450> the<00:01:52.540> person

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
squatting down and having the person

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.250 
squatting down and having the person
just<00:01:53.229> go<00:01:54.040> over<00:01:54.430> your<00:01:54.790> shoulders<00:01:55.210> grab<00:01:55.960> them

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
just go over your shoulders grab them

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.460 
just go over your shoulders grab them
stand<00:01:56.740> up<00:01:56.950> and<00:01:57.960> that's<00:01:58.960> pretty<00:01:59.229> much<00:01:59.320> all

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
stand up and that's pretty much all

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.710 
stand up and that's pretty much all
there<00:01:59.619> is<00:01:59.650> to<00:01:59.890> it

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
there is to it

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.600 
there is to it
just<00:02:01.720> as<00:02:01.960> with<00:02:02.350> a<00:02:02.380> barbell<00:02:03.040> you're<00:02:03.250> just<00:02:03.460> gonna

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
just as with a barbell you're just gonna

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.130 
just as with a barbell you're just gonna
push<00:02:04.000> press<00:02:04.420> your<00:02:05.080> person<00:02:05.560> overhead<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:07.479> hand

the barbell but Brittany who is working
actually<00:02:45.250> really<00:02:45.670> hard<00:02:45.910> in<00:02:46.120> this<00:02:46.269> picture<00:02:46.660> to

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
actually really hard in this picture to

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.960 
actually really hard in this picture to
stay<00:02:47.170> steady<00:02:47.799> although<00:02:48.370> it<00:02:48.489> looks<00:02:48.640> like<00:02:48.790> she's

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
stay steady although it looks like she's

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.800 
stay steady although it looks like she's
just<00:02:49.120> relaxing<00:02:49.690> up<00:02:49.810> there<00:02:50.019> um<00:02:50.290> is<00:02:51.220> only<00:02:51.790> 114<00:02:52.780> or

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
just relaxing up there um is only 114 or

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.070 
just relaxing up there um is only 114 or
115<00:02:53.709> pounds<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:54.459> she<00:02:54.910> is<00:02:55.209> harder<00:02:55.780> to<00:02:55.900> keep

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
115 pounds and she is harder to keep

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.320 
115 pounds and she is harder to keep
overhead<00:02:56.650> than<00:02:56.920> that<00:02:57.780> 130<00:02:58.780> pound<00:02:59.049> barbell<00:03:00.330> the

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
overhead than that 130 pound barbell the

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.199 
overhead than that 130 pound barbell the
reason<00:03:01.750> is<00:03:01.900> that<00:03:01.930> her<00:03:02.410> weight<00:03:02.709> is<00:03:03.209> unevenly

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
reason is that her weight is unevenly

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.170 
reason is that her weight is unevenly
divided<00:03:04.900> between<00:03:04.989> my<00:03:05.410> arms<00:03:05.440> and<00:03:06.130> every<00:03:06.640> time<00:03:06.910> I

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
divided between my arms and every time I

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.890 
divided between my arms and every time I
move<00:03:07.600> her<00:03:08.140> weight<00:03:08.440> shifts<00:03:09.250> so<00:03:09.820> I'm<00:03:10.209> constantly

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
move her weight shifts so I'm constantly

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
move her weight shifts so I'm constantly
making<00:03:11.440> micro<00:03:11.890> adjustments<00:03:13.079> so<00:03:14.079> consider

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
making micro adjustments so consider

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.569

pull on with the entry because honestly

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.380

that's<00:03:20.739> kind<00:03:21.370> of<00:03:21.489> like<00:03:21.670> three<00:03:22.000> quarters<00:03:22.239> of

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
that's kind of like three quarters of
