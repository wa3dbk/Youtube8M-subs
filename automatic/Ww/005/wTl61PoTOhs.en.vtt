actual construction on the house as you
can<00:00:42.230> see<00:00:42.500> here<00:00:42.739> with<00:00:44.050> my<00:00:45.050> very<00:00:45.080> kind

can see here with my very kind
father-in-law<00:00:46.010> but<00:00:46.400> it's<00:00:46.550> work<00:00:46.700> throughout

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:01:01.750 

Bobcat<00:00:59.500> and<00:01:00.500> I'm<00:01:00.890> about<00:01:01.070> to<00:01:01.190> demonstrate<00:01:01.309> when

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
Bobcat and I'm about to demonstrate when

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.250 
Bobcat and I'm about to demonstrate when
I<00:01:01.790> did<00:01:02.000> first<00:01:02.540> step<00:01:02.780> by<00:01:02.930> laying<00:01:03.080> out<00:01:03.199> the

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
I did first step by laying out the

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.070 
I did first step by laying out the
foundation<00:01:03.949> is<00:01:04.160> to<00:01:04.400> set<00:01:04.899> set<00:01:05.899> your

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
foundation is to set set your

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.570 
foundation is to set set your
measurements<00:01:06.649> for<00:01:06.860> the<00:01:06.950> dimensions<00:01:07.430> of<00:01:07.520> your

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
measurements for the dimensions of your

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.100 
measurements for the dimensions of your
house<00:01:07.910> and<00:01:08.840> I<00:01:10.060> just<00:01:11.060> use<00:01:11.210> rocks<00:01:11.509> to<00:01:11.750> mark<00:01:11.960> the

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
house and I just use rocks to mark the

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.150 
house and I just use rocks to mark the
corners<00:01:12.530> and<00:01:13.869> once<00:01:14.869> I<00:01:15.020> did<00:01:15.200> that<00:01:15.229> I<00:01:15.680> started

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
corners and once I did that I started

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.950 
corners and once I did that I started
driving<00:01:16.580> stakes<00:01:17.050> for<00:01:18.050> these<00:01:18.200> uh-oh

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.050 

whatever<00:01:21.649> these<00:01:21.770> are<00:01:21.890> called<00:01:22.100> stays<00:01:22.700> or

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
whatever these are called stays or

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.630 
whatever these are called stays or
something<00:01:23.420> like<00:01:23.570> that<00:01:23.810> but<00:01:24.190> it's<00:01:25.190> just<00:01:25.340> three

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
something like that but it's just three

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.139 
something like that but it's just three
stakes<00:01:25.970> at<00:01:26.180> each<00:01:26.300> corner<00:01:26.950> except<00:01:27.950> for<00:01:28.220> if<00:01:29.000> you

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
stakes at each corner except for if you

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:30.430 
stakes at each corner except for if you
have<00:01:29.240> to<00:01:29.360> make<00:01:29.509> an<00:01:29.630> inside<00:01:29.930> corner<00:01:30.200> you<00:01:30.410> just

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
have to make an inside corner you just

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.730 
have to make an inside corner you just
feed<00:01:30.890> two<00:01:31.160> stakes<00:01:31.490> along<00:01:35.110> that<00:01:36.110> two<00:01:36.440> stakes

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
feed two stakes along that two stakes

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:52.660 
feed two stakes along that two stakes
here<00:01:50.649> for<00:01:51.649> an<00:01:51.740> inside<00:01:52.009> corner<00:01:52.220> it's<00:01:52.429> a<00:01:52.459> little

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
here for an inside corner it's a little

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.230 
here for an inside corner it's a little
bit<00:01:52.759> harder<00:01:53.179> you<00:01:54.520> just<00:01:55.520> mark<00:01:55.700> the<00:01:55.819> corner<00:01:56.149> and

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
bit harder you just mark the corner and

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.219 
bit harder you just mark the corner and
then<00:01:56.660> you<00:01:57.099> set<00:01:58.099> here<00:01:58.399> you<00:01:58.849> have<00:01:59.720> to<00:01:59.840> go<00:01:59.959> all<00:02:00.140> the

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
then you set here you have to go all the

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:01.480 
then you set here you have to go all the
way<00:02:00.259> from<00:02:00.380> the<00:02:00.619> corner<00:02:01.009> all<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.160> way<00:02:01.250> across

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
way from the corner all the way across

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.800 
way from the corner all the way across
the<00:02:01.729> whole<00:02:01.759> thing<00:02:02.060> to<00:02:02.300> just<00:02:02.479> out<00:02:02.630> in<00:02:02.750> the

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
the whole thing to just out in the

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.389 
the whole thing to just out in the
middle<00:02:03.110> of<00:02:03.259> wherever<00:02:05.830> you<00:02:06.830> run<00:02:06.950> the<00:02:07.069> line<00:02:07.220> all

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
middle of wherever you run the line all

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:13.870 
middle of wherever you run the line all
the<00:02:07.489> way<00:02:07.550> across<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:10.640> corner<00:02:12.610> anyway<00:02:13.610> once

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
the way across the corner anyway once

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.850 
the way across the corner anyway once
you<00:02:15.310> have<00:02:16.630> your<00:02:17.630> rocks<00:02:18.319> to<00:02:18.620> lay<00:02:18.739> out

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
you have your rocks to lay out

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.740 
you have your rocks to lay out
approximately<00:02:19.400> where<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:20.030> corners<00:02:20.390> are<00:02:20.540> you

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
approximately where the corners are you

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.770 
approximately where the corners are you
just<00:02:20.959> come<00:02:21.860> off<00:02:22.040> a<00:02:22.069> few<00:02:22.430> feet

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
just come off a few feet

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.030 
just come off a few feet
corners<00:02:24.080> are<00:02:24.170> supposed<00:02:24.440> to<00:02:24.500> be<00:02:24.650> and<00:02:24.830> drive

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
corners are supposed to be and drive

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.940 
corners are supposed to be and drive
your<00:02:25.280> stakes<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:26.840> then<00:02:27.320> you<00:02:27.650> want<00:02:27.830> your

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
your stakes and then you want your

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.150 
your stakes and then you want your
stakes<00:02:28.190> to<00:02:28.340> be<00:02:28.430> nice<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:28.850> tall<00:02:29.060> and<00:02:30.040> then<00:02:31.040> you

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
stakes to be nice and tall and then you

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.440 
stakes to be nice and tall and then you
have<00:02:31.310> to<00:02:31.460> draw<00:02:31.640> level<00:02:32.600> landmarks<00:02:33.440> all<00:02:33.830> the

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
have to draw level landmarks all the

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.360 
have to draw level landmarks all the
surveys<00:02:35.450> go<00:02:35.720> you<00:02:36.650> have<00:02:36.740> to<00:02:36.830> have<00:02:36.920> at<00:02:37.040> least<00:02:37.130> two

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
surveys go you have to have at least two

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.130 
surveys go you have to have at least two
people<00:02:37.580> to<00:02:37.760> do<00:02:37.970> it<00:02:38.060> with<00:02:38.120> a<00:02:38.210> survey<00:02:38.600> scope<00:02:38.900> and

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
people to do it with a survey scope and

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.790 
people to do it with a survey scope and
a<00:02:39.260> stick<00:02:39.680> would<00:02:40.900> shoot<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:42.020> elevations<00:02:42.620> and

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
a stick would shoot the elevations and

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.800 
a stick would shoot the elevations and
everything<00:02:43.160> that's<00:02:43.340> a<00:02:43.459> lot<00:02:43.580> of<00:02:43.700> trouble<00:02:46.330> I<00:02:47.330> was

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
everything that's a lot of trouble I was

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.520 
everything that's a lot of trouble I was
in<00:02:48.020> here<00:02:48.260> by<00:02:48.620> few<00:02:48.920> places<00:02:49.750> because<00:02:50.750> my<00:02:51.020> a<00:02:51.050> scope

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
in here by few places because my a scope

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.190 
in here by few places because my a scope
was<00:02:51.800> out<00:02:51.950> of<00:02:52.070> calibration<00:02:52.660> so<00:02:53.660> a<00:02:53.690> much<00:02:53.930> more

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
was out of calibration so a much more

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.840 
was out of calibration so a much more
simpler<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:56.980> reliable<00:02:57.980> way<00:02:58.130> of<00:02:58.160> doing<00:02:58.580> it<00:02:58.700> is

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
simpler and reliable way of doing it is

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.270 
simpler and reliable way of doing it is
with<00:02:59.030> a<00:02:59.090> bucket<00:02:59.540> of<00:02:59.660> water<00:02:59.959> and<00:03:00.170> a<00:03:00.410> long<00:03:00.620> clear

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
with a bucket of water and a long clear

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.210 
with a bucket of water and a long clear
plastic<00:03:01.610> tube<00:03:01.910> such<00:03:02.420> as<00:03:02.600> this<00:03:02.890> we<00:03:03.890> fill<00:03:04.100> the

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
plastic tube such as this we fill the

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.500 
plastic tube such as this we fill the
bucket<00:03:04.520> up<00:03:04.610> with<00:03:04.640> water<00:03:06.670> you<00:03:07.670> pick<00:03:07.910> one<00:03:08.150> corner

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
bucket up with water you pick one corner

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.180 
bucket up with water you pick one corner
to<00:03:08.540> be<00:03:08.780> your<00:03:08.930> reference<00:03:09.260> corner<00:03:09.709> preferably

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
to be your reference corner preferably

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.430 
to be your reference corner preferably
in<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.310> highest<00:03:10.730> if<00:03:10.910> you<00:03:11.030> can<00:03:11.180> usually<00:03:11.570> tell

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
in the highest if you can usually tell

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.550 
in the highest if you can usually tell
which<00:03:12.650> corner<00:03:12.980> is<00:03:13.100> higher<00:03:13.660> you<00:03:14.660> I<00:03:14.690> make<00:03:15.410> sure

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
which corner is higher you I make sure

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.960 
which corner is higher you I make sure
that<00:03:15.770> the<00:03:15.860> water<00:03:16.040> level<00:03:16.430> in<00:03:16.489> the<00:03:16.550> buckets<00:03:16.880> a

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
that the water level in the buckets a

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.310 
that the water level in the buckets a
little<00:03:17.180> bit<00:03:17.270> higher<00:03:17.980> and<00:03:19.750> your<00:03:20.750> a<00:03:20.780> reference

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
little bit higher and your a reference

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.850 
little bit higher and your a reference
corner<00:03:22.630> you<00:03:23.630> can<00:03:23.780> use<00:03:23.900> a<00:03:23.930> regular<00:03:24.170> level<00:03:24.739> to

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
corner you can use a regular level to

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:39.280 
corner you can use a regular level to
set<00:03:25.070> the<00:03:25.790> first<00:03:25.970> one<00:03:37.420> then<00:03:38.420> you<00:03:38.510> have<00:03:38.630> to<00:03:38.780> suck

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
set the first one then you have to suck

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.280 
set the first one then you have to suck
on<00:03:39.440> the<00:03:39.560> tube<00:03:39.769> just<00:03:40.090> tuck<00:03:41.090> the<00:03:41.239> water<00:03:41.480> into<00:03:42.200> the

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
on the tube just tuck the water into the

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.470 
on the tube just tuck the water into the
tube<00:03:42.470> like<00:03:42.680> you're<00:03:42.830> gonna<00:03:42.980> siphon<00:03:43.489> it<00:03:43.640> and

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
tube like you're gonna siphon it and

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.979 
tube like you're gonna siphon it and
then<00:03:44.630> keep<00:03:44.810> it<00:03:44.989> low<00:03:46.450> and<00:03:47.450> then<00:03:47.600> once<00:03:47.780> you<00:03:47.840> get

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
then keep it low and then once you get

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:49.570 
then keep it low and then once you get
the<00:03:48.110> tube<00:03:48.590> completely<00:03:49.130> filled<00:03:49.400> with<00:03:49.489> water

the tube completely filled with water
you<00:03:50.150> can<00:03:50.480> come<00:03:50.630> around<00:03:50.830> have<00:03:51.830> all<00:03:51.980> the<00:03:52.130> exit

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
you can come around have all the exit

you can come around have all the exit
extra<00:03:52.880> tube<00:03:53.060> just<00:03:53.269> down<00:03:53.480> on<00:03:53.600> the<00:03:53.690> ground<00:03:53.900> you

extra tube just down on the ground you
can<00:03:54.170> come<00:03:54.380> around<00:03:54.530> you<00:03:55.160> have<00:03:55.250> to<00:03:55.310> kind<00:03:55.519> of<00:03:55.579> hold

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
can come around you have to kind of hold

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.339 
can come around you have to kind of hold
the<00:03:55.850> end<00:03:56.000> up<00:03:56.209> because<00:03:56.420> if<00:03:56.540> you<00:03:56.570> let<00:03:56.720> it<00:03:56.840> go

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.250 

you'll<00:04:00.250> start<00:04:00.430> siphoning<00:04:00.670> out<00:04:01.090> but<00:04:01.959> anyway

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
you'll start siphoning out but anyway

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.229 
you'll start siphoning out but anyway
you<00:04:02.319> watched<00:04:02.890> week<00:04:03.220> at<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:03.519> level<00:04:03.879> of<00:04:03.970> water

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
you watched week at the level of water

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.500 
you watched week at the level of water
in<00:04:04.420> the<00:04:04.510> tube<00:04:04.720> and<00:04:05.290> you<00:04:05.409> match<00:04:05.590> it<00:04:05.799> up<00:04:06.239> to<00:04:07.239> your

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
in the tube and you match it up to your

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.660 
in the tube and you match it up to your
reference<00:04:08.260> corner<00:04:08.680> and<00:04:08.920> like<00:04:09.400> I<00:04:09.430> say<00:04:09.640> you

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
reference corner and like I say you

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:10.890 
reference corner and like I say you
start<00:04:10.000> out<00:04:10.090> with<00:04:10.209> a<00:04:10.269> little<00:04:10.450> bit<00:04:10.569> too<00:04:10.750> much

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
start out with a little bit too much

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.809 
start out with a little bit too much
water<00:04:11.200> and<00:04:11.500> then<00:04:11.920> just<00:04:12.099> splash<00:04:12.340> it<00:04:12.370> out<00:04:12.640> of<00:04:12.760> the

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
water and then just splash it out of the

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.240 
water and then just splash it out of the
bucket<00:04:13.000> until<00:04:13.390> it<00:04:13.510> gets<00:04:13.659> exactly<00:04:14.080> on<00:04:14.560> just

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
bucket until it gets exactly on just

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.460 
bucket until it gets exactly on just
remember<00:04:15.640> that<00:04:15.760> that<00:04:16.000> the<00:04:16.720> water<00:04:16.930> level<00:04:17.320> it's

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
remember that that the water level it's

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.229 
remember that that the water level it's
kind<00:04:17.560> of<00:04:17.709> slow<00:04:18.010> about<00:04:18.430> getting<00:04:18.729> to<00:04:18.880> its<00:04:19.030> final

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
kind of slow about getting to its final

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:20.550 
kind of slow about getting to its final
level<00:04:19.600> so<00:04:19.720> give<00:04:19.870> it<00:04:19.900> some<00:04:19.989> time<00:04:20.320> and<00:04:20.500> be

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
level so give it some time and be

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.950 
level so give it some time and be
patient<00:04:21.060> but<00:04:22.060> then<00:04:22.180> you<00:04:22.270> can<00:04:22.419> just<00:04:22.540> walk<00:04:22.720> down

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
patient but then you can just walk down

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.719 
patient but then you can just walk down
to<00:04:23.350> each<00:04:23.440> corner<00:04:23.800> from<00:04:24.040> there<00:04:24.220> like<00:04:24.490> say<00:04:24.639> you

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
to each corner from there like say you

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:33.710 
to each corner from there like say you
have<00:04:24.820> to<00:04:24.910> cook<00:04:25.090> that<00:04:25.300> to<00:04:25.330> be<00:04:25.720> in<00:04:27.090> your<00:04:28.090> steaks

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.450 

match<00:04:34.720> up<00:04:34.990> and<00:04:35.139> take<00:04:35.289> a<00:04:35.320> pin<00:04:35.620> and<00:04:35.650> draw<00:04:36.400> the

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
match up and take a pin and draw the

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.580 
match up and take a pin and draw the
line<00:04:36.729> wherever<00:04:37.030> the<00:04:37.270> water<00:04:37.750> line<00:04:37.990> comes<00:04:38.350> to

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
line wherever the water line comes to

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:44.430 
line wherever the water line comes to
its<00:04:38.740> final<00:04:39.010> resting<00:04:39.160> place<00:04:42.330> and<00:04:43.330> that's<00:04:44.289> how

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
its final resting place and that's how

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.550 
its final resting place and that's how
you<00:04:44.500> get<00:04:44.710> a<00:04:44.770> level<00:04:45.130> grade<00:04:46.260> if<00:04:47.260> you're<00:04:47.289> working

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
you get a level grade if you're working

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.020 
you get a level grade if you're working
by<00:04:47.800> yourself<00:04:47.830> you<00:04:48.370> don't<00:04:48.520> have<00:04:48.669> a<00:04:48.699> survey

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
by yourself you don't have a survey

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.410 
by yourself you don't have a survey
scope<00:04:49.330> that's<00:04:49.570> easiest<00:04:49.900> way<00:04:49.990> to<00:04:50.020> do<00:04:50.260> it
