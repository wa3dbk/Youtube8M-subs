00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
complaints about it honestly so I would

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.670 
complaints about it honestly so I would
give<00:03:54.320> this<00:03:54.440> one<00:03:56.200> I'm<00:03:57.200> gonna<00:03:57.350> give<00:03:57.500> it<00:03:57.530> a<00:03:57.650> three

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
give this one I'm gonna give it a three

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.790 
give this one I'm gonna give it a three
but<00:03:58.489> only<00:03:58.730> because<00:03:59.209> the<00:03:59.900> bread<00:04:00.170> and<00:04:00.470> the

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
but only because the bread and the

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.710 
but only because the bread and the
calories<00:04:01.370> the<00:04:01.580> calories<00:04:01.760> is<00:04:02.180> probably<00:04:02.540> the

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
calories the calories is probably the

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.900 
calories the calories is probably the
biggest<00:04:02.989> reason<00:04:03.200> 600<00:04:04.040> calories<00:04:04.220> for<00:04:04.580> that<00:04:04.670> one

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
biggest reason 600 calories for that one

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.229 
biggest reason 600 calories for that one
sandwich<00:04:05.390> is<00:04:05.510> a<00:04:05.540> lot<00:04:05.840> of<00:04:06.080> calories<00:04:06.290> so<00:04:07.250> if

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
sandwich is a lot of calories so if

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:09.640 
sandwich is a lot of calories so if
you're<00:04:08.390> eating<00:04:08.660> it<00:04:08.750> for<00:04:08.900> lunch<00:04:09.080> it's<00:04:09.410> a<00:04:09.500> lot<00:04:09.620> of

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
you're eating it for lunch it's a lot of

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.020 
you're eating it for lunch it's a lot of
calories<00:04:09.860> for<00:04:10.190> lunch<00:04:10.400> because<00:04:10.550> you<00:04:10.670> really

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
calories for lunch because you really

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.340 
calories for lunch because you really
couldn't<00:04:11.239> eat<00:04:11.360> anything<00:04:11.630> else<00:04:11.900> that's<00:04:12.170> all<00:04:12.320> I
