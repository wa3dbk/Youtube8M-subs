00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
it's not bad going to the first gun

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.150 
it's not bad going to the first gun
you're<00:02:28.200> seeing<00:02:28.380> obviously<00:02:28.500> those<00:02:28.770> stats<00:02:29.010> with

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
you're seeing obviously those stats with

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.190 
you're seeing obviously those stats with
the<00:02:29.250> first<00:02:29.489> gun<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:30.330> second<00:02:30.720> one<00:02:30.840> is<00:02:30.870> a<00:02:30.989> very

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
the first gun the second one is a very

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.680 
the first gun the second one is a very
similar<00:02:31.380> gun<00:02:31.650> it's<00:02:31.830> like<00:02:31.920> 5,000<00:02:32.400> XP<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:32.880> all

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
similar gun it's like 5,000 XP and all

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.259 
similar gun it's like 5,000 XP and all
you<00:02:33.780> need<00:02:33.959> it<00:02:34.290> all<00:02:34.440> is<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:35.250> slower<00:02:35.670> firing<00:02:35.940> or

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
you need it all is a slower firing or

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.449 
you need it all is a slower firing or
more<00:02:36.420> damage<00:02:36.750> so<00:02:37.530> basically<00:02:37.980> is<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.220> same

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
more damage so basically is the same

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.600 
more damage so basically is the same
just<00:02:38.670> in<00:02:38.760> proportion<00:02:38.849> if<00:02:39.630> you<00:02:39.720> are<00:02:39.840> me<00:02:39.989> and

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
just in proportion if you are me and

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.430 
just in proportion if you are me and
yeah<00:02:41.610> so<00:02:41.880> I<00:02:41.910> don't<00:02:42.090> mind<00:02:42.209> tank<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:42.690> not<00:02:43.260> bad<00:02:43.410> it

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
yeah so I don't mind tank is not bad it

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.130 
yeah so I don't mind tank is not bad it
not<00:02:43.680> a<00:02:43.709> favorite<00:02:44.069> tank<00:02:44.480> str5<00:02:45.480> time<00:02:45.720> with<00:02:45.870> pro<00:02:46.019> f

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
not a favorite tank str5 time with pro f

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.630 
not a favorite tank str5 time with pro f
to<00:02:46.260> go<00:02:46.319> to<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.620> Wolverine<00:02:47.069> it's<00:02:47.430> just<00:02:47.580> an

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
to go to the Wolverine it's just an

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.610 
to go to the Wolverine it's just an
awesome<00:02:47.760> tank<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.600> this<00:02:48.750> is<00:02:48.870> very<00:02:48.989> similar<00:02:49.290> to

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
awesome tank and this is very similar to

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.710 
awesome tank and this is very similar to
the<00:02:49.739> Wolverine<00:02:50.190> as<00:02:50.400> in<00:02:50.549> it<00:02:51.000> doesn't<00:02:51.390> traverse

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
the Wolverine as in it doesn't traverse

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.289 
the Wolverine as in it doesn't traverse
very<00:02:51.989> fast<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:53.100> if<00:02:53.400> you<00:02:53.549> take<00:02:53.850> for

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
very fast that the if you take for

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.630 
very fast that the if you take for
example<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.690> stub<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.410> Stoke<00:02:55.650> moves<00:02:56.340> real

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
example the stub the Stoke moves real

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.330 
example the stub the Stoke moves real
fast<00:02:56.880> from<00:02:57.660> side<00:02:57.840> to<00:02:57.930> side<00:02:58.010> it<00:02:59.010> just<00:02:59.220> feels

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
fast from side to side it just feels

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.300 
fast from side to side it just feels
really<00:02:59.519> but<00:03:00.420> this<00:03:00.569> officer<00:03:00.840> doesn't<00:03:01.310> because

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
really but this officer doesn't because

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.190 
really but this officer doesn't because
it's<00:03:02.519> because<00:03:03.060> it's<00:03:03.150> got<00:03:03.390> a<00:03:03.420> turret<00:03:03.720> if<00:03:03.870> it

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
it's because it's got a turret if it

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.809 
it's because it's got a turret if it
moves<00:03:04.470> to<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:04.890> south<00:03:05.099> side<00:03:05.310> really<00:03:05.519> quickly

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
moves to the south side really quickly

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.220 
moves to the south side really quickly
then<00:03:05.940> it<00:03:06.180> would<00:03:06.269> be<00:03:06.390> really<00:03:06.540> overpowered<00:03:06.989> and

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
then it would be really overpowered and

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.839 
then it would be really overpowered and
that's<00:03:07.590> why<00:03:07.739> the<00:03:07.799> Wolverines<00:03:08.370> well<00:03:08.640> is

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
that's why the Wolverines well is

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:10.759 
that's why the Wolverines well is
obviously<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.810> American<00:03:10.440> tanks<00:03:10.620> that<00:03:10.709> are

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
obviously the American tanks that are

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.150 
obviously the American tanks that are
very<00:03:10.860> similar<00:03:11.720> it's<00:03:12.720> I<00:03:13.019> do<00:03:13.170> I<00:03:13.410> don't<00:03:13.860> know<00:03:14.040> what

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
very similar it's I do I don't know what

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.280 
very similar it's I do I don't know what
it<00:03:14.250> is<00:03:14.340> I<00:03:14.400> do<00:03:14.459> really<00:03:14.819> like<00:03:15.000> this<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:15.959> best<00:03:16.170> way

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
it is I do really like this the best way

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.509 
it is I do really like this the best way
to<00:03:16.349> play<00:03:16.530> that<00:03:16.680> I<00:03:16.769> find<00:03:16.950> is<00:03:17.069> watching<00:03:17.459> this

to play that I find is watching this
game<00:03:17.730> played<00:03:17.970> is<00:03:18.120> exactly<00:03:18.510> how<00:03:18.690> I'd<00:03:18.840> say<00:03:18.870> is

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
game played is exactly how I'd say is

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.430 
game played is exactly how I'd say is
play<00:03:20.519> defensive<00:03:21.060> player<00:03:21.570> that<00:03:21.690> if<00:03:22.049> you've<00:03:22.230> got

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
fast and you can use it it's sort of

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.150 
fast and you can use it it's sort of
like<00:05:10.979> a<00:05:11.039> light<00:05:11.250> tank<00:05:11.550> moving<00:05:12.300> flanking<00:05:12.930> and

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
like a light tank moving flanking and

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
then you can sort of move up spot guy

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.310 
then you can sort of move up spot guy
that's<00:05:18.210> not<00:05:18.240> too<00:05:18.479> far<00:05:18.509> away<00:05:18.720> if<00:05:18.960> they're<00:05:19.139> back

basically in captured then you can just

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.360 
basically in captured then you can just
block<00:06:09.389> bombing<00:06:09.780> battery<00:06:10.050> base<00:06:10.259> if<00:06:10.440> they're<00:06:11.009> a

suitable time than I try two more to
hunt<00:06:28.380> which<00:06:29.009> is<00:06:29.159> basically<00:06:29.460> just<00:06:29.580> find<00:06:30.150> the

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
hunt which is basically just find the

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.279 
hunt which is basically just find the
mortars<00:06:30.539> because<00:06:30.780> they're<00:06:30.870> also<00:06:30.990> going<00:06:31.139> to<00:06:31.199> be

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:31.289 
mortars because they're also going to be

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:32.870 
mortars because they're also going to be
at<00:06:31.380> the<00:06:31.440> back<00:06:31.560> of<00:06:31.590> map<00:06:31.830> normally<00:06:32.190> if<00:06:32.400> you<00:06:32.759> got

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 
at the back of map normally if you got

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:33.980 
at the back of map normally if you got
to<00:06:32.940> hang<00:06:33.060> like<00:06:33.210> this<00:06:33.240> which<00:06:33.539> doesn't<00:06:33.930> move

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:33.990 
to hang like this which doesn't move

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.019 
to hang like this which doesn't move
very<00:06:34.050> fast<00:06:34.469> reloads<00:06:35.279> very<00:06:35.550> fast<00:06:35.760> so<00:06:35.849> you<00:06:35.909> can

00:06:36.019 --> 00:06:36.029 
very fast reloads very fast so you can

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:38.600 
very fast reloads very fast so you can
