00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.670
 something illegal is happening here 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.170
 Tim Osing cleans a wall 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.029
 at least partially with his 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.699
 sandblaster he records like that 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:33.100
 so called reverse graffiti 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:35.230
 reverse graffiti and pictures like 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.519
 These are from the city of Cologne 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:42.489
 recently brought to the display the 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:44.109
 prosecutors determined that can 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:45.699
 are certainly property damage yes 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:47.649
 because the impairment in the 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:50.409
 Of course sandblasting is very intense 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:54.489
 the city removes such smears 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:59.769
 Of course much more sensitive with sandblast 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:01.749
 although intensely accurate and how complete he is 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.309
 you can see yes you can see here in the curiosity 

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:04.449
 In any case, here was a picture of me 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.119
 the city cleaned 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.830
 here, none of us was so on it 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.240
 was unfortunately in the current state in the 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.130
 liquid state left 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.530
 yes sure the city would have the same 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.770
 to clean the whole dirty wall 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:21.150
 but it is our own decision 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.470
 whether we clean that or not yes and 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.160
 we do not let ourselves of any 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.400
 third then force something to and 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.870
 from the dirt not at all 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.610
 Sometimes you do not want to cleanse 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.740
 but in the end it wants to leave it that way 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.010
 as it is, for example , the term 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.590
 party well patina here is a lot 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.780
 patina hundreds of meters the most beautiful 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.880
 patina would be a pity if the way 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.220
 comes the green youth has a few 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.140
 ask and send an open letter to the office 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.970
 the removal is written from 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.159
 dog or other code in cologne 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.110
 also punished 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.270
 one should refrain from garbage in the future 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.670
 to suspend an indication to escape 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.780
 what is the mister child on it 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.700
 reply 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.450
 ask me if you remove it 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:15.030
 of dogs and other cubs as well 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:15.030
 pursue yes finish why 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.280
 and with that, after all, this office is now 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.280
 sat 1
