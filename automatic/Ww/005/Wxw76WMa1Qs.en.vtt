the handle was designed it was designed
to<00:05:23.600> not<00:05:24.020> go<00:05:24.290> all<00:05:24.440> the<00:05:24.620> way<00:05:24.650> to<00:05:24.800> the<00:05:24.979> bottom<00:05:25.160> and

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
to not go all the way to the bottom and

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.310 
to not go all the way to the bottom and
you<00:05:25.669> can<00:05:25.820> see<00:05:26.060> here<00:05:26.330> it<00:05:26.479> just<00:05:26.510> kind<00:05:26.930> of<00:05:27.020> dips

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
you can see here it just kind of dips

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.130 
you can see here it just kind of dips
down<00:05:27.500> and<00:05:27.820> that<00:05:28.820> just<00:05:29.419> gives<00:05:29.539> you<00:05:29.870> a<00:05:29.900> little

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.140 
down and that just gives you a little

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.340 
down and that just gives you a little
bit<00:05:30.289> more<00:05:30.560> room<00:05:30.860> you<00:05:31.190> can<00:05:31.340> put<00:05:31.550> a<00:05:31.900> 402<00:05:32.900> 8<00:05:33.080> lens

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 
bit more room you can put a 402 8 lens

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.650 
bit more room you can put a 402 8 lens
here<00:05:33.680> a<00:05:33.740> 300<00:05:34.460> 28<00:05:34.850> and<00:05:35.030> just<00:05:35.240> gives<00:05:35.419> you<00:05:35.510> that

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660 
here a 300 28 and just gives you that

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.719 
here a 300 28 and just gives you that
extra<00:05:35.870> depth<00:05:36.410> that<00:05:36.650> you<00:05:36.770> need<00:05:37.010> sometimes<00:05:37.669> you

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
extra depth that you need sometimes you

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:39.880 
extra depth that you need sometimes you
can<00:05:37.850> stand<00:05:38.120> the<00:05:38.330> lens<00:05:38.570> here<00:05:38.930> maybe<00:05:39.200> a<00:05:39.260> 70<00:05:39.770> to

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:39.890 
can stand the lens here maybe a 70 to

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:41.890 
can stand the lens here maybe a 70 to
200<00:05:40.490> so<00:05:40.850> we're<00:05:41.000> just<00:05:41.030> really<00:05:41.479> trying<00:05:41.780> to

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
200 so we're just really trying to

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.230 
200 so we're just really trying to
maximize<00:05:42.590> the<00:05:42.800> space<00:05:42.950> we've<00:05:43.340> kept<00:05:43.880> it<00:05:44.030> really

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
maximize the space we've kept it really

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.050 
maximize the space we've kept it really
