00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
experiment with different lighting and

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.480 
experiment with different lighting and
angles<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:24.990> close-ups<00:00:25.680> pay<00:00:25.980> close<00:00:26.250> attention

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.220 
angles and close-ups pay close attention
to<00:00:26.939> your<00:00:27.090> background<00:00:27.449> because<00:00:28.109> the

to your background because the

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.620 
to your background because the
background<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.830> especially<00:00:29.160> important<00:00:30.029> if

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
background is especially important if

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.540 
background is especially important if
you<00:00:30.900> have<00:00:30.929> any<00:00:31.320> objects<00:00:31.740> in<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.009> background

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
you have any objects in the background

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.700 
you have any objects in the background
that<00:00:32.790> are<00:00:32.820> unnecessary<00:00:33.480> those<00:00:34.230> will<00:00:34.469> take

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
that are unnecessary those will take

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.069 
that are unnecessary those will take
away<00:00:34.980> from<00:00:35.010> your<00:00:35.340> image<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.570> will<00:00:36.870> see

here that I created this is one of the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.680 
here that I created this is one of the
photographs<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:41.430> took<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.570> the

photographs that I took and this is the

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.360 
photographs that I took and this is the
image<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:43.140> I'm<00:00:43.260> going<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.590> use<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.219> in

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
image that I'm going to use this is in

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.479 
image that I'm going to use this is in
color<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.750> want<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.110> either<00:00:46.890> photograph

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
it or you can also use tracing paper so

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.249 
it or you can also use tracing paper so
here<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.439> my<00:01:34.650> tracing<00:01:35.390> of<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.450> original

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
here is my tracing of the original

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.370 
here is my tracing of the original
photograph<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:38.630> now<00:01:39.630> I'm<00:01:39.810> going<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.140> be

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
photograph and now I'm going to be

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.530 
photograph and now I'm going to be
looking<00:01:40.770> through<00:01:41.070> different<00:01:41.250> newspapers<00:01:41.700> and

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
looking through different newspapers and

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.520 
looking through different newspapers and
find<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.920> wide<00:01:44.850> range<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.299> values<00:01:45.899> that<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:46.229> can

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
find a wide range of values that I can

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.370 
find a wide range of values that I can
incorporate<00:01:47.000> so<00:01:48.000> your<00:01:48.180> goal<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:49.140> to

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
incorporate so your goal is is to

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.469 
incorporate so your goal is is to
translate<00:01:49.799> all<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.520> these<00:01:50.670> values<00:01:50.970> within

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
translate all of these values within

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.490 
translate all of these values within
your<00:01:51.840> photograph<00:01:52.470> into<00:01:52.829> this<00:01:53.610> image<00:01:54.060> so

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
your photograph into this image so

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.200 
your photograph into this image so
you're<00:01:55.500> looking<00:01:55.740> at<00:01:56.159> different<00:01:56.549> values<00:01:56.670> and

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
you're looking at different values and

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.859 
you're looking at different values and
pulling<00:01:58.079> them<00:01:58.200> out<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.939> then<00:01:59.939> attach<00:02:00.390> laying

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
pulling them out and then attach laying

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.550 
pulling them out and then attach laying
them<00:02:01.110> out<00:02:01.229> on<00:02:01.799> your<00:02:02.130> sheet<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.549> paper<00:02:02.790> and

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
them out on your sheet of paper and

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.679 
them out on your sheet of paper and
using<00:02:04.560> thicker<00:02:05.100> quality<00:02:05.640> paper<00:02:05.880> will<00:02:06.180> also<00:02:06.509> be

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
using thicker quality paper will also be

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.559 
using thicker quality paper will also be
good<00:02:06.840> in<00:02:07.110> this<00:02:07.409> case<00:02:07.680> because<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.280> will<00:02:08.429> absorb

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
good in this case because it will absorb

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.400 
good in this case because it will absorb
your<00:02:09.569> glue<00:02:10.250> you<00:02:11.250> want<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.520> use<00:02:11.640> small<00:02:11.970> pieces

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
your glue you want to use small pieces

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.140 
your glue you want to use small pieces
but<00:02:13.410> you<00:02:13.530> can<00:02:13.709> also

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
but you can also

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.740 
but you can also
alter<00:02:14.450> them<00:02:14.629> in<00:02:14.659> size<00:02:15.040> from<00:02:16.090> this<00:02:17.090> size<00:02:17.390> to

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
alter them in size from this size to

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.140 
alter them in size from this size to
really<00:02:18.019> tiny<00:02:18.319> ones<00:02:18.650> you<00:02:19.340> could<00:02:19.489> also<00:02:19.670> cut<00:02:20.000> them

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
really tiny ones you could also cut them

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.170 
really tiny ones you could also cut them
out<00:02:20.269> by<00:02:20.569> tearing<00:02:21.079> them<00:02:21.640> creates<00:02:22.640> these<00:02:22.909> very

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
out by tearing them creates these very

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.589 
out by tearing them creates these very
soft<00:02:23.599> and<00:02:23.930> even<00:02:24.530> edges<00:02:25.159> and<00:02:25.340> it<00:02:25.879> allows<00:02:26.239> you<00:02:26.569> to

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
soft and even edges and it allows you to

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.869 
soft and even edges and it allows you to
blend<00:02:26.989> the<00:02:27.200> values<00:02:27.590> together<00:02:28.519> much<00:02:28.849> more

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
blend the values together much more

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:32.530 
blend the values together much more
effectively<00:02:29.659> so<00:02:30.459> what<00:02:31.459> you<00:02:31.579> can<00:02:31.760> also<00:02:31.939> do<00:02:32.299> is

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
effectively so what you can also do is

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.349 
effectively so what you can also do is
find<00:02:33.349> values<00:02:33.890> in<00:02:34.040> advance<00:02:34.430> and<00:02:34.790> sort<00:02:35.150> them

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:35.359 
find values in advance and sort them

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:39.630 
find values in advance and sort them
into<00:02:35.780> different<00:02:35.989> piles<00:02:37.450> and<00:02:38.450> you<00:02:39.319> can<00:02:39.500> also

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
into different piles and you can also

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.410 
into different piles and you can also
store<00:02:40.640> them<00:02:40.849> in<00:02:41.030> an<00:02:41.269> envelope<00:02:42.340> just<00:02:43.340> to<00:02:43.640> help

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
store them in an envelope just to help

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.190 
store them in an envelope just to help
you<00:02:44.629> get<00:02:45.109> yourself<00:02:45.620> organized<00:02:46.900> look<00:02:47.900> at<00:02:48.049> the

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
you get yourself organized look at the

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.170 
you get yourself organized look at the
lightest<00:02:48.709> values<00:02:49.250> and<00:02:50.290> then<00:02:51.290> see<00:02:51.859> just<00:02:52.430> how

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
lightest values and then see just how

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.009 
lightest values and then see just how
much<00:02:53.540> of<00:02:53.720> a<00:02:53.810> range<00:02:54.049> you<00:02:54.230> can<00:02:54.379> achieve<00:02:55.659> so<00:02:56.659> here

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
much of a range you can achieve so here

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.819 
much of a range you can achieve so here
are<00:02:57.079> my<00:02:57.109> lighter<00:02:57.409> values<00:02:58.040> and<00:02:59.349> then<00:03:00.349> there's

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
are my lighter values and then there's

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.580 
are my lighter values and then there's
no<00:03:01.040> really<00:03:01.459> right<00:03:01.700> way<00:03:01.909> to<00:03:02.109> arrange<00:03:03.109> them<00:03:03.439> I'm

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
no really right way to arrange them I'm

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.280 
no really right way to arrange them I'm
just<00:03:03.620> layering<00:03:04.040> them<00:03:04.519> and<00:03:05.139> trying<00:03:06.139> to

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
just layering them and trying to

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.789 
just layering them and trying to
translate<00:03:07.239> what<00:03:08.239> I'm<00:03:08.389> seeing<00:03:08.750> in<00:03:09.170> there<00:03:09.439> in

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
translate what I'm seeing in there in

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.879 
translate what I'm seeing in there in
the<00:03:10.040> photograph<00:03:10.689> as<00:03:11.689> you<00:03:11.900> can<00:03:12.109> see<00:03:12.319> my<00:03:12.500> friend

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:12.889 
the photograph as you can see my friend

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:17.619 
the photograph as you can see my friend
and<00:03:13.189> the<00:03:13.340> image<00:03:13.970> has<00:03:14.439> pastels<00:03:15.849> smeared<00:03:16.849> on<00:03:17.329> her

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629 
and the image has pastels smeared on her

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:21.009 
and the image has pastels smeared on her
arm<00:03:17.870> and<00:03:18.790> they<00:03:19.790> look<00:03:20.060> slightly<00:03:20.389> different

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
arm and they look slightly different

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:22.619 
arm and they look slightly different
they<00:03:21.169> look<00:03:21.199> more<00:03:21.530> like<00:03:21.709> bruises<00:03:22.250> in<00:03:22.430> the

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:22.629 
they look more like bruises in the

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:24.729 
they look more like bruises in the
black-and-white<00:03:23.629> photograph<00:03:24.290> but<00:03:24.560> it's

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
black-and-white photograph but it's

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.559 
black-and-white photograph but it's
still<00:03:24.949> important<00:03:25.549> to<00:03:25.579> translate<00:03:26.150> them<00:03:26.329> so<00:03:26.540> I

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
still important to translate them so I

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.280 
still important to translate them so I
found<00:03:26.959> texture<00:03:27.530> in<00:03:27.739> the<00:03:28.459> newspaper<00:03:28.940> that<00:03:29.329> has

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
found texture in the newspaper that has

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.030 
found texture in the newspaper that has
that<00:03:30.560> variation<00:03:32.139> believe<00:03:33.139> it<00:03:33.290> was<00:03:33.470> image<00:03:33.889> of

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
that variation believe it was image of

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.479 
that variation believe it was image of
popcorn<00:03:34.579> or<00:03:34.760> something<00:03:35.209> but<00:03:35.419> it<00:03:35.510> really

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
popcorn or something but it really

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.420 
popcorn or something but it really
matches<00:03:37.489> that<00:03:37.970> texture<00:03:38.690> and<00:03:38.930> value<00:03:39.889> so<00:03:40.190> I'm

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
matches that texture and value so I'm

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.330 
matches that texture and value so I'm
going<00:03:40.669> to<00:03:40.819> incorporate<00:03:41.359> it<00:03:41.540> in<00:03:41.690> here<00:03:42.129> you<00:03:43.129> can

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
going to incorporate it in here you can

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.729 
going to incorporate it in here you can
also<00:03:43.489> use<00:03:43.909> pieces<00:03:44.209> with<00:03:44.569> text<00:03:45.019> if<00:03:45.199> they<00:03:45.470> match

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
also use pieces with text if they match

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.649 
also use pieces with text if they match
a<00:03:46.069> certain<00:03:47.680> texture<00:03:48.680> in<00:03:49.010> the<00:03:49.629> image<00:03:50.629> that

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:50.659 
a certain texture in the image that

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:53.110 
a certain texture in the image that
you're<00:03:51.019> creating<00:03:51.349> if<00:03:51.889> you<00:03:52.430> see<00:03:52.790> certain

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
you're creating if you see certain

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.569 
you're creating if you see certain
details<00:03:53.720> or<00:03:54.019> wrinkles<00:03:54.530> you<00:03:54.709> can<00:03:54.889> actually<00:03:55.099> cut

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
details or wrinkles you can actually cut

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:58.710 
details or wrinkles you can actually cut
them<00:03:55.729> out<00:03:55.940> and<00:03:56.379> use<00:03:57.379> them<00:03:57.409> as<00:03:57.739> actual<00:03:58.190> shapes

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
them out and use them as actual shapes

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.449 
them out and use them as actual shapes
rather<00:03:59.720> than<00:04:00.190> torn<00:04:01.190> pieces<00:04:02.440> so<00:04:03.440> having<00:04:03.769> a<00:04:04.159> nice

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
rather than torn pieces so having a nice

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.680 
rather than torn pieces so having a nice
variety<00:04:05.449> of<00:04:05.870> shapes<00:04:06.319> and<00:04:06.590> edges<00:04:07.449> will<00:04:08.449> work

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
variety of shapes and edges will work

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.530 
variety of shapes and edges will work
well<00:04:09.019> in<00:04:09.049> your<00:04:09.229> artwork<00:04:10.090> this<00:04:11.090> will<00:04:11.359> begin

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
well in your artwork this will begin

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.920 
well in your artwork this will begin
forming<00:04:12.319> and<00:04:12.979> coming<00:04:13.549> together<00:04:13.760> slowly<00:04:14.359> but

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
forming and coming together slowly but

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.750 
forming and coming together slowly but
you<00:04:15.049> just<00:04:15.229> have<00:04:15.409> to<00:04:15.530> be<00:04:15.650> patient<00:04:16.280> and<00:04:16.459> you<00:04:16.549> have

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
you just have to be patient and you have

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.939 
you just have to be patient and you have
to<00:04:17.320> continue<00:04:18.320> adding<00:04:19.010> and<00:04:20.320> subtracting<00:04:21.320> until

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:21.949 
to continue adding and subtracting until

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:25.480 
to continue adding and subtracting until
you<00:04:22.070> find<00:04:22.370> all<00:04:22.789> the<00:04:23.029> right<00:04:23.210> values<00:04:23.719> I<00:04:24.490> would

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
you find all the right values I would

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.620 
you find all the right values I would
not<00:04:25.669> recommend<00:04:25.849> using<00:04:26.360> colors<00:04:26.960> and<00:04:27.260> your

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
not recommend using colors and your

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.530 
not recommend using colors and your
alar<00:04:27.900> since<00:04:28.320> this<00:04:28.530> is<00:04:28.740> about<00:04:29.120> recreating<00:04:30.120> a

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
alar since this is about recreating a

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.050 
alar since this is about recreating a
black-and-white<00:04:31.050> image<00:04:31.440> I<00:04:31.890> think<00:04:32.460> the<00:04:32.910> most

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
black-and-white image I think the most

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.530 
black-and-white image I think the most
challenging<00:04:33.690> part<00:04:34.040> comes<00:04:35.040> in<00:04:35.420> creating<00:04:36.420> the

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
challenging part comes in creating the

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.900 
challenging part comes in creating the
facial<00:04:36.960> features<00:04:37.370> so<00:04:38.370> for<00:04:38.610> the<00:04:38.700> facial

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
facial features so for the facial

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.530 
facial features so for the facial
features<00:04:39.120> you<00:04:39.720> could<00:04:39.870> actually<00:04:41.210> cut<00:04:42.210> them<00:04:42.390> out

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
features you could actually cut them out

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.160 
features you could actually cut them out
trace<00:04:43.110> them<00:04:43.350> and<00:04:43.470> cut<00:04:43.680> them<00:04:43.830> out<00:04:44.990> like<00:04:45.990> the

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
trace them and cut them out like the

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.050 
trace them and cut them out like the
lips<00:04:46.410> and<00:04:46.650> the<00:04:46.740> nose<00:04:46.920> and<00:04:46.950> attach<00:04:47.640> them<00:04:47.940> on

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
lips and the nose and attach them on

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.780 
lips and the nose and attach them on
their<00:04:48.420> own<00:04:48.470> rather<00:04:49.470> or<00:04:50.220> you<00:04:50.370> can<00:04:50.550> try<00:04:50.760> to

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
their own rather or you can try to

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.230 
their own rather or you can try to
recreate<00:04:51.540> them<00:04:51.840> using<00:04:52.200> small<00:04:52.560> bits<00:04:53.000> it's<00:04:54.000> also

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
recreate them using small bits it's also

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.120 
recreate them using small bits it's also
important<00:04:54.990> that<00:04:55.050> you<00:04:55.350> recreate<00:04:55.950> the

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
important that you recreate the

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.490 
important that you recreate the
background<00:04:56.670> and<00:04:57.030> for<00:04:57.690> the<00:04:57.780> background<00:04:57.990> you

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
background and for the background you

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.080 
background and for the background you
can<00:04:58.530> use<00:04:58.740> much<00:04:59.190> bigger<00:04:59.490> shapes<00:05:01.670> than<00:05:02.670> the<00:05:02.880> ones

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
can use much bigger shapes than the ones

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.870 
can use much bigger shapes than the ones
you<00:05:03.300> used<00:05:03.570> in<00:05:03.780> the<00:05:03.870> body

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
you used in the body

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.880 
you used in the body
just<00:05:05.880> remember<00:05:06.300> variety<00:05:06.870> is<00:05:06.930> important<00:05:07.650> and

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
just remember variety is important and

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.400 
just remember variety is important and
it<00:05:08.070> can<00:05:08.250> really<00:05:08.460> add<00:05:08.580> to<00:05:08.730> your<00:05:09.060> image<00:05:09.420> you<00:05:10.200> can

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
it can really add to your image you can

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.740 
it can really add to your image you can
create<00:05:10.680> the<00:05:10.890> background<00:05:11.370> using<00:05:11.610> strips<00:05:12.210> that

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
create the background using strips that

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.410 
create the background using strips that
are<00:05:12.810> vertical<00:05:13.410> or<00:05:13.500> horizontal<00:05:14.300> depending<00:05:15.300> on

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:15.420 
are vertical or horizontal depending on

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.540 
are vertical or horizontal depending on
what<00:05:15.600> you<00:05:15.720> see<00:05:15.960> in<00:05:16.080> your<00:05:16.200> image<00:05:16.620> and<00:05:17.070> once<00:05:17.310> you

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
what you see in your image and once you

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.830 
what you see in your image and once you
lay<00:05:17.730> your<00:05:18.060> entire<00:05:18.390> collage<00:05:18.840> out<00:05:19.200> you<00:05:19.440> can<00:05:20.840> take

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
lay your entire collage out you can take

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.730 
lay your entire collage out you can take
some<00:05:22.170> glue<00:05:22.700> some<00:05:23.700> white<00:05:23.940> glue<00:05:24.180> and<00:05:24.740> start

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
some glue some white glue and start

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.720 
some glue some white glue and start
gluing<00:05:25.950> these<00:05:26.430> in<00:05:26.610> place<00:05:28.100> just<00:05:29.100> remember<00:05:29.580> that

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730 
gluing these in place just remember that

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.790 
gluing these in place just remember that
you're<00:05:29.910> using<00:05:30.150> thicker<00:05:30.810> paper<00:05:31.140> such<00:05:31.590> as<00:05:31.770> a

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
you're using thicker paper such as a

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.550 
you're using thicker paper such as a
drawing<00:05:32.100> or<00:05:32.460> watercolor<00:05:32.970> paper<00:05:33.300> so<00:05:34.200> that<00:05:34.410> it's

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
drawing or watercolor paper so that it's

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.700 
drawing or watercolor paper so that it's
able<00:05:34.770> to<00:05:34.950> absorb<00:05:35.430> some<00:05:35.760> of<00:05:35.790> that<00:05:35.910> glue<00:05:36.330> and

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
able to absorb some of that glue and

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:42.770 
able to absorb some of that glue and
remember<00:05:37.710> you<00:05:37.830> don't<00:05:37.950> need<00:05:38.070> a<00:05:38.190> lot<00:05:40.220> and<00:05:41.780> then

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
remember you don't need a lot and then

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.420 
remember you don't need a lot and then
areas<00:05:43.380> that<00:05:43.710> you're<00:05:43.950> building<00:05:44.370> up<00:05:44.990> you<00:05:45.990> can

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
areas that you're building up you can

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:53.480 
areas that you're building up you can
add<00:05:47.430> one<00:05:47.700> piece<00:05:50.180> and<00:05:51.500> then<00:05:52.500> you<00:05:52.650> can<00:05:52.830> glue

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
add one piece and then you can glue

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:59.240 
add one piece and then you can glue
another<00:05:53.970> one<00:05:54.210> over<00:05:54.960> it<00:05:55.250> and<00:05:56.250> so<00:05:56.880> on<00:05:57.120> and<00:05:58.250> over

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
another one over it and so on and over

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.030 
another one over it and so on and over
time<00:06:00.030> as<00:06:00.390> you<00:06:00.630> develop<00:06:01.140> it<00:06:01.320> your<00:06:01.560> piece<00:06:01.800> will

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.040 
time as you develop it your piece will

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.670 
time as you develop it your piece will
develop<00:06:02.970> a<00:06:03.090> tactile<00:06:03.570> quality<00:06:04.260> it<00:06:04.350> will<00:06:04.470> look

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
develop a tactile quality it will look

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.090 
develop a tactile quality it will look
as<00:06:04.890> though<00:06:05.180> you<00:06:06.180> can<00:06:06.420> sense<00:06:07.050> and<00:06:07.350> feel<00:06:07.410> the

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100 
as though you can sense and feel the

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.350 
as though you can sense and feel the
surface<00:06:08.340> in<00:06:08.820> front<00:06:08.850> of<00:06:09.270> you<00:06:10.910> see<00:06:11.910> here<00:06:12.240> I'm

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
surface in front of you see here I'm

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.660 
surface in front of you see here I'm
building<00:06:13.020> up<00:06:13.670> this<00:06:14.670> collage<00:06:16.310> you<00:06:17.310> might<00:06:17.460> find

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:17.670 
building up this collage you might find

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:19.820 
building up this collage you might find
it<00:06:17.880> helpful<00:06:18.180> to<00:06:18.330> glue<00:06:18.990> some<00:06:19.290> of<00:06:19.440> the<00:06:19.560> shapes

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
it helpful to glue some of the shapes

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.980 
it helpful to glue some of the shapes
and<00:06:20.130> then<00:06:20.310> come<00:06:20.550> back<00:06:20.580> and<00:06:20.970> start<00:06:21.390> adding<00:06:21.840> more

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
and then come back and start adding more

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.230 
and then come back and start adding more
shapes<00:06:22.350> as<00:06:22.680> you<00:06:23.070> go<00:06:23.250> along<00:06:23.550> rather<00:06:23.910> than

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
shapes as you go along rather than

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.780 
shapes as you go along rather than
having<00:06:25.020> all<00:06:25.320> of<00:06:25.350> them<00:06:25.650> laid<00:06:25.920> out<00:06:25.950> in<00:06:26.370> front<00:06:26.610> of

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:26.790 
having all of them laid out in front of

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.870 
having all of them laid out in front of
you<00:06:26.910> so<00:06:27.210> try<00:06:27.690> this<00:06:27.750> out<00:06:28.050> and<00:06:28.350> see<00:06:28.560> how<00:06:28.700> you<00:06:29.700> like
