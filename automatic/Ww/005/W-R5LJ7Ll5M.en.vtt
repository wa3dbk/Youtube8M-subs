okay<00:00:02.520> so<00:00:02.580> I've<00:00:03.000> now<00:00:03.300> completed<00:00:03.510> the<00:00:04.609> building

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
okay so I've now completed the building

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.070 
okay so I've now completed the building
of<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:06.060> new<00:00:06.089> computer<00:00:06.359> with<00:00:06.839> all<00:00:06.960> the

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
of the new computer with all the

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.250 
of the new computer with all the
components<00:00:07.319> actual<00:00:07.830> Nana's<00:00:08.220> video<00:00:08.880> I<00:00:09.719> didn't

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
components actual Nana's video I didn't

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.009 
components actual Nana's video I didn't
show<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:11.429> wall<00:00:11.639> building<00:00:11.940> process<00:00:12.480> because

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
show the wall building process because

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.060 
show the wall building process because
I'm<00:00:13.380> by<00:00:13.980> myself<00:00:14.099> with<00:00:14.730> my<00:00:14.759> phone<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.750> my

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
I'm by myself with my phone and my

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.310 
I'm by myself with my phone and my
needed<00:00:17.070> micron's<00:00:17.580> so<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.750> I<00:00:18.810> didn't<00:00:19.050> wanted

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
needed micron's so and I didn't wanted

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.130 
needed micron's so and I didn't wanted
to<00:00:19.350> shoot<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.619> ceiling<00:00:19.890> again<00:00:20.010> so<00:00:20.880> as<00:00:21.720> you<00:00:21.960> can

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
to shoot the ceiling again so as you can

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.700 
to shoot the ceiling again so as you can
see<00:00:22.439> inside<00:00:23.060> it's<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.180> very<00:00:24.390> tight<00:00:24.810> fit<00:00:25.170> for<00:00:25.590> all

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
see inside it's a very tight fit for all

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.650 
see inside it's a very tight fit for all
the<00:00:25.859> components<00:00:26.189> but<00:00:26.550> everything<00:00:27.060> fits<00:00:27.330> very

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
the components but everything fits very

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.070 
the components but everything fits very
nicely<00:00:28.279> so<00:00:29.279> we<00:00:29.550> are<00:00:29.699> we<00:00:30.210> have<00:00:30.330> here<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.689> Radeon

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
nicely so we are we have here the Radeon

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.350 
nicely so we are we have here the Radeon
which<00:00:31.439> takes<00:00:31.740> pretty<00:00:32.130> much<00:00:32.250> all<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:33.120> pace

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
which takes pretty much all the the pace

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.799 
which takes pretty much all the the pace
that<00:00:33.750> he<00:00:34.469> can<00:00:34.710> take<00:00:35.989> and<00:00:36.989> at<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.230> back<00:00:38.629> so<00:00:39.629> from

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
that he can take and at the back so from

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.229 
that he can take and at the back so from
a<00:00:39.930> top<00:00:40.170> view<00:00:40.200> where<00:00:40.879> cables<00:00:41.879> are<00:00:42.030> kind<00:00:42.210> of

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
a top view where cables are kind of

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.069 
a top view where cables are kind of
messy<00:00:42.629> but<00:00:42.899> that's<00:00:43.680> what<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:44.390> this<00:00:45.390> i<00:00:45.570> have<00:00:45.840> our

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
messy but that's what is this i have our

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:54.319 
messy but that's what is this i have our
supply<00:00:48.379> and<00:00:49.379> everything<00:00:49.950> else<00:00:50.219> here<00:00:53.210> so<00:00:54.210> in

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
supply and everything else here so in

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.590 
supply and everything else here so in
order<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.600> get<00:00:54.809> everything<00:00:54.840> into<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.620> channel

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
order to get everything into a channel

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.630 
order to get everything into a channel
and<00:00:57.600> you'd<00:00:57.809> put<00:00:58.140> about<00:00:58.649> in<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.190> yellow

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
and you'd put about in the yellow

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.420 
and you'd put about in the yellow
another<00:01:00.449> red<00:01:00.690> one<00:01:01.039> otherwise<00:01:02.039> i<00:01:02.190> will<00:01:02.280> not

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
another red one otherwise i will not

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.759 
another red one otherwise i will not
have<00:01:02.640> gotten<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.390> dual<00:01:03.690> channels<00:01:04.080> at<00:01:04.589> least

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
have gotten the dual channels at least

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.480 
have gotten the dual channels at least
according<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.309> instruction<00:01:05.760> so

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
according to the instruction so

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.760 
according to the instruction so
basically<00:01:08.490> when<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.700> poured<00:01:08.909> this<00:01:09.150> baby<00:01:10.049> up<00:01:10.170> at

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
basically when I poured this baby up at

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.010 
basically when I poured this baby up at
like<00:01:11.040> this<00:01:11.220> little<00:01:11.490> button<00:01:11.729> there<00:01:11.960> there's<00:01:12.960> a

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
like this little button there there's a

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.310 
like this little button there there's a
slider<00:01:13.290> inside<00:01:14.360> that<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.420> can<00:01:15.570> adjust<00:01:15.659> that

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
slider inside that you can adjust that

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.289 
slider inside that you can adjust that
will<00:01:16.770> open<00:01:18.229> the<00:01:19.229> drive<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:20.759> comes<00:01:21.060> down

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
will open the drive and this comes down

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.070 
will open the drive and this comes down
and<00:01:21.740> you<00:01:22.740> Detroit<00:01:23.460> comes<00:01:23.520> out<00:01:23.880> which<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.900> kind

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
and you Detroit comes out which is kind

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.700 
and you Detroit comes out which is kind
of<00:01:25.110> nice<00:01:25.290> because<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.830> always<00:01:25.979> keep<00:01:26.369> an<00:01:26.580> ID<00:01:26.729> TD

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
of nice because you always keep an ID TD

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.120 
of nice because you always keep an ID TD
front<00:01:28.710> instead<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.700> all<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.450> messy<00:01:31.130> words

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
front instead of all the messy words

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.109 
front instead of all the messy words
that<00:01:32.430> they<00:01:32.490> put<00:01:32.759> in<00:01:33.030> front<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.509> those<00:01:33.869> players

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
that they put in front of those players

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.270 
that they put in front of those players
so<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.270> there<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:37.350> don't<00:01:37.470> receive<00:01:37.890> from<00:01:38.070> air

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
so in there you don't receive from air

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.140 
so in there you don't receive from air
but<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.850> actually<00:01:39.270> put<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:40.310> HDD<00:01:41.310> drive<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:41.909> i<00:01:41.970> got

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
but I actually put to HDD drive so i got

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.950 
but I actually put to HDD drive so i got
my<00:01:42.259> SSD<00:01:43.259> as<00:01:43.680> i<00:01:44.130> showed<00:01:44.310> earlier<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.850> i<00:01:45.630> put<00:01:45.840> in

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
my SSD as i showed earlier and i put in

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.969 
my SSD as i showed earlier and i put in
an<00:01:46.110> old<00:01:46.320> HDD<00:01:47.659> standard<00:01:48.659> as<00:01:48.840> well<00:01:49.259> just<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.860> add

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
an old HDD standard as well just to add

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.139 
an old HDD standard as well just to add
some<00:01:50.040> more<00:01:50.340> space<00:01:51.290> so<00:01:52.290> in<00:01:52.409> total<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:53.549> SSD<00:01:54.000> has

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
some more space so in total the SSD has

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.160 
some more space so in total the SSD has
120<00:01:54.689> gigs<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.860> other<00:01:55.979> drive<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.990> 200<00:01:57.990> gig

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
120 gigs and the other drive is 200 gig

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.560 
120 gigs and the other drive is 200 gig
so<00:01:58.409> i<00:01:58.469> got<00:01:58.619> about<00:01:58.740> 200<00:01:59.369> 20<00:01:59.610> gigs<00:01:59.820> of<00:02:00.149> space<00:02:00.270> in

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
so i got about 200 20 gigs of space in

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.050 
so i got about 200 20 gigs of space in
there<00:02:00.860> which<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:02.040> plenty<00:02:02.219> enough<00:02:02.549> considering

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
there which is plenty enough considering

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.499 
there which is plenty enough considering
that<00:02:03.299> i<00:02:03.360> have<00:02:03.659> an<00:02:03.960> ass<00:02:04.460> network<00:02:05.460> with<00:02:05.759> 1.5

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
that i have an ass network with 1.5

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.680 
that i have an ass network with 1.5
terabyte<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:07.350> space<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.330> just<00:02:09.509> big

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
terabyte of space so that it just big

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.960 
terabyte of space so that it just big
enough<00:02:10.069> so<00:02:11.069> I'm<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.310> show<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:11.550> this<00:02:11.730> side

enough so I'm to show you this side

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.680 
enough so I'm to show you this side
