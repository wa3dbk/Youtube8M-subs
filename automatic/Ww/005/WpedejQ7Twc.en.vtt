unique<00:01:19.030> way<00:01:19.270> now<00:01:19.780> in<00:01:19.899> order<00:01:20.020> to<00:01:20.140> do<00:01:20.409> that<00:01:20.590> I

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
unique way now in order to do that I

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:22.830 
unique way now in order to do that I
want<00:01:21.069> to<00:01:21.159> be<00:01:21.249> able<00:01:21.369> to<00:01:21.549> see<00:01:21.969> some<00:01:22.329> of<00:01:22.450> the<00:01:22.539> space

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 
that is to zoom out a bit I will say one

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:30.419 
that is to zoom out a bit I will say one
of<00:01:28.420> the<00:01:28.539> annoying<00:01:28.899> things<00:01:29.049> about<00:01:29.740> keynote<00:01:30.249> is

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:30.429 
of the annoying things about keynote is

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:32.459 
of the annoying things about keynote is
that<00:01:30.789> they<00:01:31.149> automatically<00:01:31.810> have<00:01:31.960> your<00:01:32.259> slide

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:32.469 
that they automatically have your slide

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:35.039 
that they automatically have your slide
hug<00:01:32.799> the<00:01:33.100> left<00:01:33.310> side<00:01:33.549> of<00:01:33.700> the<00:01:33.759> screen<00:01:33.939> here<00:01:34.240> as

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
hug the left side of the screen here as

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:37.410 
hug the left side of the screen here as
well<00:01:35.350> as<00:01:35.469> the<00:01:35.590> top<00:01:35.799> and<00:01:36.100> so<00:01:36.579> it's<00:01:36.789> very<00:01:36.999> hard<00:01:37.299> to

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
well as the top and so it's very hard to

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.889 
well as the top and so it's very hard to
animate<00:01:38.020> objects<00:01:38.530> onto<00:01:38.799> the<00:01:39.700> slide<00:01:39.969> from<00:01:40.780> the

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
animate objects onto the slide from the

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:42.749 
animate objects onto the slide from the
top<00:01:41.109> or<00:01:41.530> the<00:01:41.740> left<00:01:41.950> because<00:01:42.249> you<00:01:42.280> can't<00:01:42.579> really

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
top or the left because you can't really

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.160 
top or the left because you can't really
see<00:01:43.030> where<00:01:43.179> they<00:01:43.329> are<00:01:43.450> there's<00:01:43.659> a<00:01:43.719> way<00:01:43.869> to<00:01:43.899> do

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
see where they are there's a way to do

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.690 
see where they are there's a way to do
it<00:01:44.200> which<00:01:44.469> I<00:01:44.590> can<00:01:44.770> show<00:01:44.920> you<00:01:44.979> in<00:01:45.159> another<00:01:45.249> in

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
it which I can show you in another in

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.330 
it which I can show you in another in
another<00:01:46.469> video<00:01:47.469> but<00:01:47.679> for<00:01:47.740> now<00:01:47.889> what<00:01:48.189> I'm<00:01:48.249> going

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
to do is I'm going to bring an image in

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.730 
to do is I'm going to bring an image in
here<00:01:49.899> I<00:01:50.049> have<00:01:50.829> a<00:01:51.100> PNG<00:01:51.939> image<00:01:52.389> of<00:01:52.990> the<00:01:53.590> earth

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
here I have a PNG image of the earth

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.459 
here I have a PNG image of the earth
kind<00:01:54.249> of<00:01:54.399> an<00:01:54.490> icon<00:01:54.969> that<00:01:55.209> I'm<00:01:55.869> going<00:01:56.020> to<00:01:56.079> upload

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
kind of an icon that I'm going to upload

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:59.269 
kind of an icon that I'm going to upload
into<00:01:56.889> the<00:01:57.009> slide<00:01:57.249> here<00:01:57.490> it<00:01:57.579> is<00:01:57.700> right<00:01:58.209> here

00:01:59.269 --> 00:01:59.279 
into the slide here it is right here

00:01:59.279 --> 00:02:01.379 
into the slide here it is right here
computers<00:02:00.279> a<00:02:00.340> little<00:02:00.549> slow<00:02:00.759> today<00:02:00.969> for<00:02:01.270> some

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:01.389 
computers a little slow today for some

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:02.249 
computers a little slow today for some
reason<00:02:01.420> here<00:02:01.869> we<00:02:01.959> go

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
reason here we go

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.959 
reason here we go
and<00:02:02.350> we're<00:02:03.340> going<00:02:03.429> to<00:02:03.490> insert<00:02:03.909> that<00:02:04.179> right<00:02:05.969> and

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:06.969 
and we're going to insert that right and

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:09.120 
and we're going to insert that right and
there<00:02:07.179> it<00:02:07.299> is<00:02:07.420> now<00:02:07.719> very<00:02:08.440> important<00:02:08.860> for<00:02:09.009> this

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
there it is now very important for this

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.050 
there it is now very important for this
to<00:02:09.340> look<00:02:09.490> good

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
to look good

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.660 
to look good
you<00:02:10.300> want<00:02:10.509> a<00:02:10.690> PNG<00:02:11.470> file<00:02:11.740> what<00:02:12.069> that<00:02:12.250> means<00:02:12.459> it's

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
you want a PNG file what that means it's

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:13.890 
you want a PNG file what that means it's
going<00:02:12.790> to<00:02:12.849> have<00:02:12.940> a<00:02:13.060> transparent<00:02:13.750> background

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
going to have a transparent background

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.440 
going to have a transparent background
you<00:02:14.709> do<00:02:14.830> not<00:02:14.920> want<00:02:15.160> to<00:02:15.220> see<00:02:15.340> a<00:02:15.370> white<00:02:15.700> box<00:02:16.090> or<00:02:16.420> a

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
you do not want to see a white box or a

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.390 
you do not want to see a white box or a
black<00:02:16.690> box<00:02:17.050> around<00:02:17.290> your<00:02:17.650> object<00:02:17.770> it<00:02:18.190> just

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
black box around your object it just

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.280 
black box around your object it just
won't<00:02:18.700> look<00:02:18.849> right<00:02:19.180> so<00:02:19.420> when<00:02:20.140> you're

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
won't look right so when you're

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.750 
won't look right so when you're
searching<00:02:20.500> on<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:20.890> web<00:02:20.920> you<00:02:21.220> can<00:02:21.310> search<00:02:21.550> for

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
searching on the web you can search for

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.700 
searching on the web you can search for
PNG<00:02:22.270> files<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:22.780> they're<00:02:22.900> generally<00:02:23.290> going<00:02:23.410> to

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
PNG files and they're generally going to

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.370 
PNG files and they're generally going to
be<00:02:23.890> transparent<00:02:24.670> now<00:02:25.330> what<00:02:25.930> I<00:02:25.960> want<00:02:26.260> to

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
be transparent now what I want to

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.540 
be transparent now what I want to
achieve<00:02:26.530> is

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
achieve is

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.300 
achieve is
the<00:02:27.880> earth<00:02:28.090> to<00:02:28.600> appear<00:02:29.050> as<00:02:29.290> if<00:02:29.320> it's<00:02:29.650> rolling

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
the earth to appear as if it's rolling

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.150 
the earth to appear as if it's rolling
on<00:02:30.550> to<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:30.910> slide<00:02:31.150> and<00:02:31.570> so<00:02:32.380> to<00:02:32.470> start<00:02:32.800> that<00:02:32.980> I

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
on to the slide and so to start that I

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.950 
on to the slide and so to start that I
need<00:02:33.370> to<00:02:33.490> bring<00:02:33.610> it<00:02:33.760> off<00:02:33.910> the<00:02:34.360> slide<00:02:34.570> so<00:02:34.870> I'm

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
need to bring it off the slide so I'm

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.540 
need to bring it off the slide so I'm
going<00:02:35.110> to<00:02:35.140> drag<00:02:35.350> it<00:02:35.530> over<00:02:35.650> here<00:02:35.830> onto<00:02:36.220> the<00:02:36.340> side

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
going to drag it over here onto the side

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.010 
going to drag it over here onto the side
now<00:02:36.730> if<00:02:36.850> I<00:02:36.910> were<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.150> play<00:02:37.330> the<00:02:37.570> slide<00:02:37.750> right

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
now if I were to play the slide right

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.260 
now if I were to play the slide right
now<00:02:38.080> you<00:02:38.800> would<00:02:38.980> not<00:02:39.130> see<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.610> earth<00:02:39.730> I<00:02:40.000> want

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
now you would not see the earth I want

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.900 
now you would not see the earth I want
to<00:02:40.360> make<00:02:40.540> it<00:02:40.720> move<00:02:40.990> in<00:02:41.320> okay<00:02:42.130> I'm<00:02:42.790> actually

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
to make it move in okay I'm actually

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.160 
to make it move in okay I'm actually
going<00:02:43.180> to<00:02:43.270> start<00:02:43.510> with<00:02:43.660> it<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:43.840> little<00:02:44.020> bit

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
going to start with it a little bit

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.920 
going to start with it a little bit
smaller<00:02:44.530> because<00:02:44.770> as<00:02:45.100> I<00:02:45.520> make<00:02:45.730> it<00:02:45.760> move<00:02:46.090> in<00:02:46.390> I'm

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
smaller because as I make it move in I'm

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.080 
smaller because as I make it move in I'm
also<00:02:47.140> going<00:02:47.350> to<00:02:47.410> make<00:02:47.590> it<00:02:47.800> kind<00:02:48.340> of<00:02:48.520> roll<00:02:48.820> and

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
also going to make it kind of roll and

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.930 
also going to make it kind of roll and
grow<00:02:50.080> in<00:02:50.260> size<00:02:50.500> so<00:02:51.310> we're<00:02:51.460> actually<00:02:51.610> going<00:02:51.880> to

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
grow in size so we're actually going to

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.690 
grow in size so we're actually going to
be<00:02:52.030> using<00:02:52.360> three<00:02:52.750> build<00:02:53.050> effects<00:02:53.500> at<00:02:53.710> once<00:02:54.010> so

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
be using three build effects at once so

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.520 
be using three build effects at once so
here's<00:02:55.000> my<00:02:55.120> inspector<00:02:55.630> I'm<00:02:56.050> going<00:02:56.200> to<00:02:56.260> go<00:02:56.350> into

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
here's my inspector I'm going to go into

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.250 
here's my inspector I'm going to go into
the<00:02:56.620> build<00:02:56.800> tab<00:02:57.070> and<00:02:57.660> with<00:02:58.660> my<00:02:58.840> object

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
the build tab and with my object

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.810 
the build tab and with my object
selected<00:02:59.650> I'm<00:02:59.740> going<00:02:59.890> to<00:02:59.950> go<00:03:00.100> to<00:03:00.160> an<00:03:00.370> action

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
selected I'm going to go to an action

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.990 
selected I'm going to go to an action
now<00:03:01.510> like<00:03:01.690> I<00:03:01.780> said<00:03:01.840> we<00:03:01.990> need<00:03:02.230> to<00:03:02.290> add<00:03:02.500> three

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
now like I said we need to add three

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.730 
now like I said we need to add three
simultaneous<00:03:04.140> actions<00:03:05.140> here<00:03:05.350> and<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.530> first

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
simultaneous actions here and the first

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.340 
simultaneous actions here and the first
one<00:03:05.920> is<00:03:06.010> going<00:03:06.130> to<00:03:06.190> be<00:03:06.340> the<00:03:06.460> move<00:03:06.700> action<00:03:07.350> just

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
one is going to be the move action just

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.690 
one is going to be the move action just
move<00:03:08.560> this<00:03:08.740> out<00:03:08.890> of<00:03:08.920> the<00:03:09.010> way<00:03:09.160> and<00:03:09.400> I'm<00:03:09.580> going

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
move this out of the way and I'm going

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.230 
move this out of the way and I'm going
to<00:03:09.790> choose<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.350> move<00:03:11.350> action<00:03:11.800> and<00:03:12.310> you<00:03:13.000> see<00:03:13.150> it

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
to choose the move action and you see it

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.460 
to choose the move action and you see it
right<00:03:13.360> there<00:03:13.390> now<00:03:13.660> what<00:03:13.870> I<00:03:13.900> want<00:03:14.110> to<00:03:14.140> do<00:03:14.260> is<00:03:14.380> I

middle of the slide that looks pretty
good

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
good

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.280 
good
excellent<00:03:24.310> so<00:03:25.150> you<00:03:25.270> can<00:03:25.570> see<00:03:25.780> in<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:25.960> preview

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
excellent so you can see in the preview

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.630 
excellent so you can see in the preview
here<00:03:26.470> and<00:03:26.590> I'll<00:03:26.680> actually<00:03:26.980> play<00:03:27.220> it<00:03:27.370> for<00:03:27.520> you

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
here and I'll actually play it for you

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.980 
here and I'll actually play it for you
all<00:03:28.390> we<00:03:28.690> have<00:03:28.900> so<00:03:29.170> far<00:03:29.470> is<00:03:29.820> this<00:03:30.820> which<00:03:31.660> is<00:03:31.690> fine

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
all we have so far is this which is fine

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.320 
all we have so far is this which is fine
but<00:03:32.709> we<00:03:32.890> can<00:03:33.100> kind<00:03:33.490> of<00:03:33.580> dress<00:03:33.820> that<00:03:33.850> up<00:03:34.209> a

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
but we can kind of dress that up a

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.630 
but we can kind of dress that up a
little<00:03:34.480> bit<00:03:34.690> I'd<00:03:35.530> actually<00:03:35.980> like<00:03:36.130> to<00:03:36.190> make<00:03:36.490> it

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
little bit I'd actually like to make it

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.060 
little bit I'd actually like to make it
look<00:03:36.820> like<00:03:37.000> the<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:37.450> earth<00:03:37.630> is<00:03:37.900> rolling<00:03:38.470> as<00:03:38.650> it

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
look like the the earth is rolling as it

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.270 
look like the the earth is rolling as it
comes<00:03:39.310> in<00:03:39.550> so<00:03:40.330> now<00:03:40.540> with<00:03:41.110> my<00:03:41.140> earth<00:03:41.590> selected

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
comes in so now with my earth selected

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.240 
comes in so now with my earth selected
I'm<00:03:42.459> going<00:03:42.640> to<00:03:42.700> add<00:03:42.850> a<00:03:43.300> second<00:03:43.930> action<00:03:44.220> okay

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
I'm going to add a second action okay

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.090 
I'm going to add a second action okay
but<00:03:45.880> it's<00:03:46.180> by<00:03:46.480> default<00:03:46.720> a<00:03:47.170> second<00:03:47.590> move<00:03:47.800> but<00:03:48.070> I

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
but it's by default a second move but I

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.380 
but it's by default a second move but I
don't<00:03:48.370> want<00:03:48.580> that<00:03:48.730> so<00:03:48.910> I'm<00:03:48.970> going<00:03:49.090> to<00:03:49.180> change

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
don't want that so I'm going to change

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.420 
don't want that so I'm going to change
this<00:03:49.750> move<00:03:50.080> to<00:03:50.740> a<00:03:50.770> rotate<00:03:51.900> okay<00:03:52.900> and<00:03:53.170> I<00:03:54.040> want<00:03:54.310> it

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
this move to a rotate okay and I want it

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.090 
this move to a rotate okay and I want it
to<00:03:54.550> rotate<00:03:55.060> counterclockwise<00:03:55.810> to<00:03:56.800> look<00:03:56.950> like

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
to rotate counterclockwise to look like

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.100 
to rotate counterclockwise to look like
it's<00:03:57.250> rolling<00:03:57.430> to<00:03:57.760> the<00:03:57.850> left<00:03:58.060> and<00:03:58.300> I<00:03:58.780> want<00:03:58.990> to

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
it's rolling to the left and I want to

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.199 
it's rolling to the left and I want to
do<00:03:59.230> a<00:03:59.260> full<00:03:59.709> spin<00:04:00.100> so<00:04:00.670> I'm<00:04:00.760> going<00:04:00.910> to<00:04:00.970> make<00:04:01.090> the

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
do a full spin so I'm going to make the

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.220 
do a full spin so I'm going to make the
rotation<00:04:01.720> 360<00:04:02.530> degrees<00:04:03.750> let's<00:04:04.750> see<00:04:04.930> if<00:04:05.020> that's

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
rotation 360 degrees let's see if that's

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.710 
rotation 360 degrees let's see if that's
working<00:04:05.590> now<00:04:05.709> to<00:04:06.610> make<00:04:06.790> this<00:04:07.030> look<00:04:07.360> good

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
working now to make this look good

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.270 
working now to make this look good
see<00:04:07.990> here's<00:04:08.380> what<00:04:08.530> it<00:04:08.620> looks<00:04:08.770> like<00:04:08.920> right<00:04:09.130> now

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
see here's what it looks like right now

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.990 
see here's what it looks like right now
right<00:04:09.490> now<00:04:10.450> I<00:04:10.720> have<00:04:11.110> the<00:04:11.410> earth<00:04:11.590> move<00:04:12.459> in<00:04:12.730> and

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
right now I have the earth move in and

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.960 
right now I have the earth move in and
then<00:04:13.720> roll<00:04:14.410> now<00:04:15.340> we<00:04:15.400> don't<00:04:15.640> want<00:04:15.760> that<00:04:15.850> to

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
then roll now we don't want that to

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.520 
then roll now we don't want that to
happen<00:04:16.060> we<00:04:16.330> want<00:04:16.510> them<00:04:16.660> to<00:04:16.690> occur<00:04:17.020> at<00:04:17.140> the<00:04:17.200> same

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
happen we want them to occur at the same

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.199 
happen we want them to occur at the same
time<00:04:17.859> so<00:04:18.100> it<00:04:18.220> actually<00:04:18.549> looks<00:04:18.790> as<00:04:18.940> if<00:04:19.090> the

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
time so it actually looks as if the

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.500 
time so it actually looks as if the
earth<00:04:19.330> is<00:04:19.540> rolling<00:04:20.169> onto<00:04:20.680> the<00:04:20.799> screen<00:04:21.640> so<00:04:22.419> I'm

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
earth is rolling onto the screen so I'm

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.150 
earth is rolling onto the screen so I'm
going<00:04:22.660> to<00:04:22.720> select<00:04:22.840> that<00:04:23.080> second<00:04:23.650> build<00:04:23.860> and

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
going to select that second build and

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.909 
going to select that second build and
I'm<00:04:24.730> going<00:04:24.880> to<00:04:24.940> select<00:04:25.470> automatically<00:04:26.470> with

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
I'm going to select automatically with

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.150 
I'm going to select automatically with
build<00:04:27.370> one<00:04:27.730> and<00:04:28.110> so<00:04:29.110> now<00:04:29.380> it's<00:04:29.650> actually<00:04:29.830> going

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
build one and so now it's actually going

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.010 
build one and so now it's actually going
to<00:04:30.250> look<00:04:30.430> like<00:04:30.640> it's<00:04:30.880> rolling<00:04:31.150> in<00:04:31.540> let<00:04:31.750> me<00:04:31.840> show

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
to look like it's rolling in let me show

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.200 
to look like it's rolling in let me show
you<00:04:32.110> what<00:04:32.260> it<00:04:32.350> looks<00:04:32.530> like<00:04:32.710> now<00:04:32.919> so<00:04:33.820> here<00:04:34.120> we

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
you what it looks like now so here we

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.659 
you what it looks like now so here we
have<00:04:34.419> the<00:04:34.690> earth<00:04:34.810> and<00:04:35.050> it<00:04:35.350> is<00:04:35.500> rolling<00:04:36.100> in<00:04:36.280> that

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
have the earth and it is rolling in that

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:38.070 
have the earth and it is rolling in that
looks<00:04:36.910> pretty<00:04:37.060> good<00:04:37.180> that's<00:04:37.419> kind<00:04:37.660> of<00:04:37.750> neat<00:04:37.930> on

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
looks pretty good that's kind of neat on

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.290 
looks pretty good that's kind of neat on
its<00:04:38.260> own<00:04:38.410> but<00:04:39.160> now<00:04:39.310> I<00:04:39.340> want<00:04:39.550> to<00:04:39.610> add<00:04:39.729> some<00:04:40.000> depth

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
its own but now I want to add some depth

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.830 
its own but now I want to add some depth
and<00:04:40.570> to<00:04:40.660> do

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
and to do

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.720 
and to do
that<00:04:41.020> I<00:04:41.050> want<00:04:41.380> to<00:04:41.440> make<00:04:41.560> it<00:04:41.710> actually<00:04:41.889> grow<00:04:42.430> and

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
that I want to make it actually grow and

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.790 
that I want to make it actually grow and
actually<00:04:43.090> get<00:04:43.300> bigger<00:04:43.570> while<00:04:44.320> it's<00:04:44.590> moving

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
actually get bigger while it's moving

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.770 
actually get bigger while it's moving
and<00:04:45.190> rotating<00:04:45.520> so<00:04:46.300> I'm<00:04:46.360> going<00:04:46.510> to<00:04:46.540> go<00:04:46.630> ahead

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
and rotating so I'm going to go ahead

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.129 
and rotating so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:04:46.930> add<00:04:47.020> a<00:04:47.050> third<00:04:47.199> action<00:04:48.750> now<00:04:49.750> by<00:04:49.960> default

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
and add a third action now by default

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.980 
and add a third action now by default
it's<00:04:50.800> the<00:04:51.460> same<00:04:51.760> as<00:04:51.970> the<00:04:52.120> previous<00:04:52.360> one<00:04:52.600> so

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
it's the same as the previous one so

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.719 
it's the same as the previous one so
right<00:04:53.139> now<00:04:53.290> it's<00:04:53.440> added<00:04:53.800> a<00:04:53.889> rotate<00:04:54.280> again<00:04:54.520> but

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
right now it's added a rotate again but

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:57.689 
right now it's added a rotate again but
this<00:04:54.910> one<00:04:55.150> I<00:04:55.360> want<00:04:55.930> to<00:04:56.110> be<00:04:56.139> scale<00:04:56.889> I<00:04:57.160> want<00:04:57.580> to

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:57.699 
this one I want to be scale I want to

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.450 
this one I want to be scale I want to
make<00:04:57.850> it<00:04:57.970> bigger<00:04:58.270> and<00:04:58.630> I<00:04:59.470> want<00:04:59.979> to<00:05:00.040> actually

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
make it bigger and I want to actually

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.909 
make it bigger and I want to actually
make<00:05:00.699> it<00:05:00.910> about<00:05:01.510> two<00:05:01.990> times<00:05:02.320> bigger<00:05:02.590> so<00:05:02.860> I'm

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
make it about two times bigger so I'm

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:06.060 
make it about two times bigger so I'm
going<00:05:03.040> to<00:05:03.100> go<00:05:03.190> all<00:05:03.430> the<00:05:03.669> way<00:05:03.699> up<00:05:03.910> to<00:05:04.060> 200%<00:05:05.070> okay

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
going to go all the way up to 200% okay

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.360 
going to go all the way up to 200% okay
but<00:05:06.729> again<00:05:07.060> I<00:05:07.300> want<00:05:07.600> it<00:05:07.780> to<00:05:07.870> happen<00:05:08.050> with<00:05:08.590> build

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
but again I want it to happen with build

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.360 
but again I want it to happen with build
one<00:05:09.729> and<00:05:10.260> so<00:05:11.260> all<00:05:11.500> three<00:05:11.770> actions<00:05:12.220> are

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
one and so all three actions are

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.730 
one and so all three actions are
happening<00:05:12.520> at<00:05:12.790> the<00:05:12.940> same<00:05:13.210> time<00:05:13.270> here<00:05:13.930> I'm

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
happening at the same time here I'm

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.580 
happening at the same time here I'm
going<00:05:14.919> to<00:05:14.979> take<00:05:15.160> my<00:05:15.400> acceleration<00:05:16.000> off<00:05:16.419> on<00:05:16.840> all

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
going to take my acceleration off on all

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.510 
going to take my acceleration off on all
three<00:05:18.300> just<00:05:19.300> so<00:05:19.419> it's<00:05:19.600> a<00:05:19.660> kind<00:05:19.870> of<00:05:19.990> a<00:05:20.080> linear

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
three just so it's a kind of a linear

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.950 
three just so it's a kind of a linear
acceleration<00:05:21.520> and<00:05:21.700> then<00:05:22.510> that<00:05:22.690> way<00:05:22.840> it

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
acceleration and then that way it

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.690 
acceleration and then that way it
doesn't<00:05:23.139> kind<00:05:23.500> it<00:05:23.770> it<00:05:23.950> looks<00:05:24.250> a<00:05:24.340> little<00:05:24.460> bit

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:24.700 
doesn't kind it it looks a little bit

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.690 
doesn't kind it it looks a little bit
more<00:05:24.970> natural<00:05:25.600> okay<00:05:26.560> so<00:05:26.620> oh<00:05:27.040> sorry

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
more natural okay so oh sorry

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.659 
more natural okay so oh sorry
so<00:05:30.700> turn<00:05:31.000> that<00:05:31.210> off<00:05:31.479> and<00:05:31.750> same<00:05:32.289> with<00:05:32.470> move<00:05:32.740> I'm

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
so turn that off and same with move I'm

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:36.090 
so turn that off and same with move I'm
going<00:05:33.910> to<00:05:33.970> turn<00:05:34.150> the<00:05:34.450> acceleration<00:05:35.350> off<00:05:35.560> for

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 
going to turn the acceleration off for

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.300 
going to turn the acceleration off for
the<00:05:36.190> move<00:05:36.750> okay<00:05:37.750> and<00:05:37.990> I<00:05:38.560> think<00:05:38.830> also<00:05:39.010> I'm<00:05:39.190> going

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
the move okay and I think also I'm going

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.629 
the move okay and I think also I'm going
to<00:05:39.400> move<00:05:39.580> this<00:05:39.910> up<00:05:40.150> a<00:05:40.600> little<00:05:40.930> bit<00:05:41.080> and<00:05:41.639> over

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 
to move this up a little bit and over

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:46.590 
to move this up a little bit and over
and<00:05:43.050> let's<00:05:44.050> see<00:05:44.320> what<00:05:44.530> we<00:05:44.620> got<00:05:45.030> okay<00:05:46.030> so<00:05:46.240> here's

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
and let's see what we got okay so here's

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.070 
and let's see what we got okay so here's
my<00:05:46.660> slide<00:05:47.050> and<00:05:47.639> there's<00:05:48.639> the<00:05:48.850> build<00:05:49.090> now<00:05:49.780> if

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
my slide and there's the build now if

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.200 
my slide and there's the build now if
it's<00:05:50.350> if<00:05:50.620> it's<00:05:50.770> a<00:05:50.860> little<00:05:51.100> off<00:05:51.370> to<00:05:51.729> you<00:05:51.760> you<00:05:52.030> can

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
it's if it's a little off to you you can

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.850 
it's if it's a little off to you you can
tweak<00:05:52.539> it<00:05:52.690> one<00:05:52.900> of<00:05:53.020> the<00:05:53.080> things<00:05:53.289> I<00:05:53.440> like<00:05:53.590> to<00:05:53.740> do

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
tweak it one of the things I like to do

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.120 
tweak it one of the things I like to do
is<00:05:54.130> actually<00:05:54.750> move<00:05:55.750> the<00:05:56.050> starting<00:05:56.440> point<00:05:56.650> over

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.130 
is actually move the starting point over

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.640 
is actually move the starting point over
it<00:05:58.120> tends<00:05:58.450> to<00:05:58.630> make<00:05:58.780> it<00:05:58.810> look<00:05:59.080> a<00:05:59.200> little<00:05:59.410> bit

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
it tends to make it look a little bit

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.219 
it tends to make it look a little bit
more<00:05:59.979> natural<00:06:00.310> I<00:06:00.849> don't<00:06:01.630> see<00:06:01.780> what<00:06:01.900> that<00:06:02.050> looks

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:02.229 
more natural I don't see what that looks

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:07.290 
more natural I don't see what that looks
like<00:06:02.320> now<00:06:05.340> that's<00:06:06.340> pretty<00:06:06.639> good<00:06:06.820> right<00:06:06.880> there

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.300 
like now that's pretty good right there

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.260 
like now that's pretty good right there
of<00:06:08.110> course<00:06:08.470> then<00:06:08.710> what<00:06:08.919> you<00:06:09.070> could<00:06:09.220> do<00:06:09.400> is<00:06:09.669> you

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
of course then what you could do is you

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.469 
of course then what you could do is you
could<00:06:10.389> have<00:06:10.630> it<00:06:10.979> have<00:06:11.979> a<00:06:12.010> shadow<00:06:12.610> of<00:06:12.970> some<00:06:13.210> sort

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:13.479 
could have it have a shadow of some sort

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:16.350 
could have it have a shadow of some sort
or<00:06:13.720> a<00:06:14.340> reflection<00:06:15.340> I<00:06:15.520> think<00:06:15.820> what<00:06:16.150> I'm<00:06:16.240> going

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 
or a reflection I think what I'm going

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.029 
or a reflection I think what I'm going
to<00:06:16.450> do<00:06:16.570> is<00:06:16.810> give<00:06:17.050> it<00:06:17.139> a<00:06:17.200> little<00:06:17.440> bit<00:06:17.710> of<00:06:17.919> a

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:18.039 
to do is give it a little bit of a

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:20.610 
to do is give it a little bit of a
reflection<00:06:18.450> no<00:06:19.450> no<00:06:19.810> reflection<00:06:20.289> that's<00:06:20.440> not

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.620 
reflection no no reflection that's not

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.170 
reflection no no reflection that's not
working<00:06:20.830> so<00:06:20.979> well<00:06:21.310> with<00:06:21.460> this<00:06:21.610> image<00:06:21.910> but<00:06:22.090> I

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:22.180 
working so well with this image but I

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.750 
working so well with this image but I
can<00:06:22.360> give<00:06:22.479> it<00:06:22.570> a<00:06:22.599> little<00:06:22.630> bit<00:06:22.960> of<00:06:23.050> a<00:06:23.110> shadow

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:23.760 
can give it a little bit of a shadow

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.390 
can give it a little bit of a shadow
with<00:06:24.760> no<00:06:25.060> offset<00:06:25.750> and<00:06:26.110> let's<00:06:26.830> see<00:06:27.099> what<00:06:27.280> the

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 
with no offset and let's see what the

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.180 
with no offset and let's see what the
final<00:06:27.610> product<00:06:28.060> is<00:06:28.180> let's<00:06:28.660> take<00:06:28.870> a<00:06:28.900> look

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.190 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.400 

pretty<00:06:33.190> good<00:06:33.430> nice<00:06:34.030> little<00:06:34.330> nifty<00:06:34.630> animation

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:35.410 
pretty good nice little nifty animation

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.200 
pretty good nice little nifty animation
and<00:06:35.620> of<00:06:35.919> course<00:06:36.190> you<00:06:36.310> can<00:06:36.460> do<00:06:36.580> this<00:06:36.760> with<00:06:36.970> any

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.210 
and of course you can do this with any

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.270 
and of course you can do this with any
object<00:06:37.720> I<00:06:37.840> used<00:06:38.050> in<00:06:38.200> earth<00:06:38.380> as<00:06:38.620> an<00:06:38.740> example<00:06:39.190> I

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.280 
object I used in earth as an example I

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.610 
object I used in earth as an example I
teach<00:06:39.340> earth<00:06:39.940> science<00:06:40.330> but<00:06:41.080> it<00:06:41.169> could<00:06:41.320> be<00:06:41.410> any

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:41.620 
teach earth science but it could be any

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.140 
teach earth science but it could be any
object<00:06:41.800> at<00:06:42.099> all<00:06:42.160> you<00:06:42.340> could<00:06:42.430> animate<00:06:42.729> a<00:06:42.880> ball

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.150 
object at all you could animate a ball

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:44.790 
object at all you could animate a ball
and<00:06:43.450> coming<00:06:43.870> in<00:06:43.990> you<00:06:44.110> can<00:06:44.260> animate<00:06:44.470> a<00:06:44.590> ball

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 
and coming in you can animate a ball

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.980 
and coming in you can animate a ball
bouncing<00:06:45.310> in<00:06:45.430> by<00:06:45.580> using<00:06:45.760> curved<00:06:46.180> motion<00:06:46.750> paths

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:46.990 
bouncing in by using curved motion paths

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.719 
bouncing in by using curved motion paths
there's<00:06:47.620> really<00:06:47.800> no<00:06:47.979> limit<00:06:48.310> to<00:06:48.340> what<00:06:48.550> you<00:06:48.610> can

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:48.729 
there's really no limit to what you can

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:51.420
