00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
and it comes with it um you could build

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.210 
and it comes with it um you could build
the<00:00:29.980> car<00:00:30.250> as<00:00:30.429> well<00:00:31.140> out<00:00:32.140> of<00:00:32.380> the<00:00:32.500> two<00:00:32.680> of<00:00:32.830> them<00:00:33.040> I

the car as well out of the two of them I

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.220 
the car as well out of the two of them I
decided<00:00:33.940> to<00:00:34.120> build<00:00:34.300> the<00:00:34.450> quad<00:00:34.630> bike<00:00:34.900> because

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
decided to build the quad bike because

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.560 
decided to build the quad bike because
it<00:00:35.440> looked<00:00:35.620> better<00:00:36.130> so<00:00:37.090> I'll<00:00:37.180> turn<00:00:37.420> it<00:00:37.539> back

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
it looked better so I'll turn it back

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:45.720 
it looked better so I'll turn it back
over<00:00:37.780> for<00:00:38.050> you<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:39.340> is<00:00:39.969> aged<00:00:42.809> its<00:00:43.809> age<00:00:44.199> 9<00:00:45.010> to<00:00:45.579> 16

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
over for you it is aged its age 9 to 16

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.180 
over for you it is aged its age 9 to 16
and<00:00:46.300> it's<00:00:46.420> set<00:00:46.690> number<00:00:46.840> is<00:00:47.140> eight<00:00:47.410> two<00:00:47.770> six<00:00:47.800> two

and it's set number is eight two six two

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.020 
and it's set number is eight two six two
which<00:00:49.180> um<00:00:49.210> i<00:00:50.100> would<00:00:51.100> say<00:00:51.280> cool<00:00:51.520> because<00:00:51.730> ISIL

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
which um i would say cool because ISIL

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.200 
which um i would say cool because ISIL
o'leary<00:00:52.329> usually<00:00:52.690> say<00:00:53.340> now<00:00:54.340> to<00:00:54.399> the<00:00:55.000> set

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
o'leary usually say now to the set

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.029 
o'leary usually say now to the set
itself<00:00:55.769> this<00:00:56.769> is<00:00:57.039> a<00:00:57.579> pretty<00:00:57.969> cool<00:00:58.890> quad<00:00:59.890> bike

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:00.039 
itself this is a pretty cool quad bike

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:02.880 
itself this is a pretty cool quad bike
I'd<00:01:00.219> say<00:01:00.460> this<00:01:01.329> is<00:01:01.539> my<00:01:01.780> first<00:01:02.019> technique<00:01:02.559> I've

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
I'd say this is my first technique I've

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.110 
I'd say this is my first technique I've
done<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:04.570> so<00:01:04.960> it<00:01:05.110> was<00:01:05.230> pretty

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.120 
done and so it was pretty

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.880 
done and so it was pretty
straightforward<00:01:07.120> to<00:01:07.150> build<00:01:07.420> I<00:01:07.990> would

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
straightforward to build I would

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.179 
straightforward to build I would
recommend<00:01:09.759> this<00:01:10.180> I<00:01:10.479> would<00:01:11.259> recommend<00:01:11.439> this<00:01:11.950> to

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:12.189 
recommend this I would recommend this to

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:14.460 
recommend this I would recommend this to
beginners<00:01:12.820> because<00:01:13.509> I<00:01:13.750> managed<00:01:14.110> right<00:01:14.320> with

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
beginners because I managed right with

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.200 
beginners because I managed right with
it<00:01:14.500> and<00:01:14.619> this<00:01:14.799> is<00:01:15.009> my<00:01:15.130> first<00:01:15.400> technic<00:01:15.790> set<00:01:16.030> I

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
it and this is my first technic set I

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.510 
it and this is my first technic set I
wouldn't<00:01:17.020> recommend<00:01:17.710> it<00:01:18.040> to<00:01:18.100> really

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
wouldn't recommend it to really

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.700 
wouldn't recommend it to really
experienced<00:01:20.850> Technic<00:01:21.850> builders<00:01:22.780> because<00:01:23.439> if

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
experienced Technic builders because if

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.910 
experienced Technic builders because if
they<00:01:23.860> do<00:01:23.920> if<00:01:24.430> they<00:01:24.700> if<00:01:24.880> you<00:01:25.630> do<00:01:25.780> get<00:01:25.990> it<00:01:26.049> it<00:01:26.799> will

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
they do if they if you do get it it will

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.120 
they do if they if you do get it it will
probably<00:01:27.070> be<00:01:27.340> a<00:01:27.460> bit<00:01:27.700> too<00:01:27.909> easy<00:01:28.119> for<00:01:28.270> you<00:01:29.130> so

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
probably be a bit too easy for you so

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.789 
probably be a bit too easy for you so
yeah<00:01:30.340> there's<00:01:31.329> a<00:01:31.420> free<00:01:31.600> pieces<00:01:32.049> I<00:01:32.259> haven't
