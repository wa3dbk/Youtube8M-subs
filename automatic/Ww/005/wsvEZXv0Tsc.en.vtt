anything I'm trying to learn her hit
combos<00:01:56.580> and<00:01:56.610> stuff<00:01:57.000> so<00:01:57.780> we<00:01:58.470> love<00:01:58.650> tekken<00:01:59.010> six

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
and i think it has a really good setup

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.109 
and i think it has a really good setup
but<00:02:01.260> the<00:02:01.710> downside<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:02.280> for<00:02:02.460> my<00:02:02.580> mood<00:02:02.759> we<00:02:02.940> got<00:02:03.090> a

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
but the downside is for my mood we got a

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.560 
but the downside is for my mood we got a
bad<00:02:03.299> copy<00:02:03.570> but<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:03.930> freezes<00:02:04.170> so<00:02:04.650> much<00:02:04.920> yeah<00:02:05.759> and

the<00:02:06.900> Internet<00:02:07.259> can<00:02:07.350> be<00:02:07.409> kind<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.740> laggy<00:02:07.890> but

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
the Internet can be kind of laggy but

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.740 
the Internet can be kind of laggy but
that's<00:02:08.340> not<00:02:08.429> really<00:02:08.610> ever<00:02:08.880> a<00:02:08.970> big<00:02:09.149> deal<00:02:09.360> yeah
