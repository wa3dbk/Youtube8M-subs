this<00:00:38.659> is<00:00:39.289> the<00:00:39.589> shuttle's<00:00:40.070> fuel<00:00:40.489> tank<00:00:40.820> it<00:00:41.659> may

00:00:41.919 --> 00:00:41.929 
this is the shuttle's fuel tank it may

this is the shuttle's fuel tank it may
only<00:00:42.109> be<00:00:42.379> a<00:00:42.769> hundred<00:00:43.010> and<00:00:43.280> thirty<00:00:43.549> miles<00:00:43.879> to

only be a hundred and thirty miles to

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:46.660 
only be a hundred and thirty miles to
space<00:00:44.570> but<00:00:44.929> to<00:00:45.079> cover<00:00:45.379> that<00:00:45.589> distance<00:00:45.859> the

space but to cover that distance the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.450 
space but to cover that distance the
engines<00:00:47.149> will<00:00:47.359> use<00:00:47.659> half<00:00:48.229> a<00:00:48.440> million<00:00:48.799> gallons

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460

engines will use half a million gallons
of<00:00:49.699> fuel<00:00:49.760> and<00:00:50.390> that<00:00:51.019> works<00:00:51.350> out<00:00:51.710> at<00:00:52.519> two<00:00:52.939> feet

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:53.299 
of fuel and that works out at two feet

NASA<00:00:58.850> does<00:00:59.299> need<00:00:59.570> to<00:00:59.750> test<00:01:00.019> these<00:01:00.229> engines

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
NASA does need to test these engines

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.069 
NASA does need to test these engines
once<00:01:01.039> in<00:01:01.219> a<00:01:01.280> while<00:01:01.489> so<00:01:02.239> they<00:01:02.390> built<00:01:02.600> this<00:01:02.750> place

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
once in a while so they built this place

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:12.279 
once in a while so they built this place
in<00:01:03.469> the<00:01:03.739> wetlands<00:01:04.250> of<00:01:04.369> Mississippi<00:01:11.020> the<00:01:12.020> first

00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:12.289 
in the wetlands of Mississippi the first

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:14.279 
in the wetlands of Mississippi the first
thing<00:01:12.560> they<00:01:12.709> installed<00:01:13.220> was<00:01:13.549> a<00:01:13.580> huge

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:14.289 
thing they installed was a huge

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:16.840 
thing they installed was a huge
loudspeaker<00:01:15.289> through<00:01:16.069> which<00:01:16.280> they<00:01:16.580> played

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
loudspeaker through which they played

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.719 
loudspeaker through which they played
white<00:01:17.270> noise<00:01:17.569> to<00:01:17.990> simulate<00:01:18.259> the<00:01:18.679> sound<00:01:19.009> of<00:01:19.340> a

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
white noise to simulate the sound of a

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.930 
white noise to simulate the sound of a
rocket

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.690 

they<00:01:25.570> then<00:01:25.780> sent<00:01:26.140> a<00:01:26.410> number<00:01:26.890> of<00:01:27.010> trucks<00:01:27.340> in

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
they then sent a number of trucks in

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.270 
they then sent a number of trucks in
different<00:01:28.300> directions<00:01:28.600> out<00:01:29.190> into<00:01:30.190> the

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
different directions out into the

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.430 
different directions out into the
wilderness<00:01:30.490> and<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.570> drivers<00:01:31.990> were<00:01:32.110> ordered

wilderness and the drivers were ordered

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.680 
wilderness and the drivers were ordered
to<00:01:32.470> stop<00:01:32.950> when<00:01:33.250> leaf<00:01:33.460> noise<00:01:33.820> levels<00:01:34.270> became

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
to stop when leaf noise levels became

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.830 
to stop when leaf noise levels became
acceptable<00:01:35.320> this<00:01:36.130> gave<00:01:36.490> them<00:01:36.760> an<00:01:36.940> imaginary

is<00:02:36.049> the<00:02:36.349> loudest<00:02:36.680> sound<00:02:37.189> you<00:02:37.819> could<00:02:38.000> possibly

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
is the loudest sound you could possibly

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.520 
is the loudest sound you could possibly
conceive<00:02:39.379> and<00:02:40.280> as<00:02:40.730> it<00:02:40.879> turns<00:02:41.180> out

now<00:02:48.990> the<00:02:49.410> most<00:02:49.680> amazing<00:02:50.430> thing<00:02:50.670> is<00:02:50.850> that<00:02:50.880> that

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
now the most amazing thing is that that

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.420 
now the most amazing thing is that that
cloud<00:02:51.750> up<00:02:52.050> there<00:02:52.290> which<00:02:52.470> was<00:02:52.680> generated<00:02:53.400> by

cloud up there which was generated by

cloud up there which was generated by
the<00:02:53.670> engine<00:02:53.880> is<00:02:54.540> just<00:02:55.050> a<00:02:55.170> mixture<00:02:55.530> of<00:02:55.650> hydrogen

and oxygen it's water vapor and in about
an<00:02:59.490> hour's<00:02:59.790> time<00:02:59.820> someone<00:03:00.720> in<00:03:00.870> Mississippi<00:03:01.530> is

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
an hour's time someone in Mississippi is

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.320 
an hour's time someone in Mississippi is
going<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.040> get<00:03:02.220> wet<00:03:02.460> washing<00:03:02.760> it<00:03:03.090> will

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
going to get wet washing it will

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:10.250 
going to get wet washing it will
actually<00:03:03.630> rain

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:18.789 

I<00:03:10.290> told<00:03:11.069> you<00:03:14.390> that's<00:03:15.470> unbelievable

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.920 

lets's<00:03:19.799> believe<00:03:20.159> god<00:03:20.489> it's<00:03:21.299> making<00:03:21.659> it's<00:03:21.780> a
