00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.550
 I am Juan moral daily of our 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.349
 organization the sun of life 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.630
 and we are enjoying right now 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:28.310
 holding our corn with seeds 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.640
 a beautiful variety of seeds 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.110
 flavors in the meals in the drinks in 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.460
 different families are 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:39.250
 sharing that celebration 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.829
 is based on seeds and 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.769
 meals that families are bringing 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:47.800
 who share with us what they have inherited from 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:50.649
 his grandparents of his ancestors 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.590
 and for us it is very important that 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:56.470
 we can tell the world 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.240
 to other families that we do not want 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.950
 hybrid corn we do not want the 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.950
 genetically altered maize 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:08.090
 but that our option ours 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:10.910
 decisions with seeds and 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.370
 free seeds the seeds that do not 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:17.590
 are patented and the seeds that 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.590
 they are in the hands of each family 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.460
 how 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.069
 today is the day of nonviolence of 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.729
 direct nation and we have decided to dedicate 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:43.000
 to a very large network of fighters 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:45.220
 and guardians of seeds to come 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.860
 and share 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.990
 We claim the right to equality 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.439
 produce 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:57.119
 reproduce multiply interchange 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:02:00.020
 donald share sell and give away 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:03.500
 freely nails 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.369
 it is known to the organisms 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.379
 genetically modified and lipids 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.540
 degenerative as seeds since not 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:14.450
 promote the function of generating and 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.879
 sustain life therefore princess 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.269
 We have all forms of property 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:23.780
 intellectual about organisms are 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:26.330
 then the corporation control over the 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.780
 life since it generates a monopoly and 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.690
 dependence 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.970
 all show dreams and those 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.860
 technologies that impede reproduction 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.930
 and you give in it radio and cover 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.150
 planet without of victims are criminalized 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.239
 the free flow and multiplication of 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.250
 the seeds the illegitimate laws that 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.640
 they carry out practices that threaten life 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.489
 the use of broken agrochemicals 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.440
 crops and any policy and practice that 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.220
 helps people's lives against the 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.739
 Ecosystem health and conversion 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.510
 we propose agroecology with a 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.030
 solution to economic problems 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.340
 social and cultural issues that affect 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.580
 world us in the department of 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.770
 this tool 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:15.740
 in the municipality of santa cruz 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:18.200
 and policies and practices consistent with the 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.690
 environment that I think is part of what 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.190
 we want to support for our canton to 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.530
 Santa Cruz 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.960
 these manipulated transgenic seeds 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.090
 we were to understand 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.640
 towards crops and dependence 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.070
 towards transnational companies that 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.520
 they do not allow us to produce 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.520
 organized and others 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.310
 how 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.380
 ovidio fernÃ¡ndez I am the president of the 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:07.500
 national table final change and this 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.900
 today's activity with respect to corn is 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.250
 very interesting for us 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.250
 important and we have lost that culture 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.350
 to consume our products 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.209
 tropical countries 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.130
 we are consuming today and other 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.770
 things other flours that's why we have 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.290
 both nutritional imbalances in 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.620
 our children because we have this 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:31.290
 Excessive mood level as they are overweight 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.540
 and we also have malnutrition thing that 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.860
 turned on years ago we did not have it the 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.020
 preservation of cultural heritage 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.860
 we must see it beyond our 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.719
 dances 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.460
 but we must also focus on our 

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:44.620
 food safety with our 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.840
 cultural heritage are also our 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.919
 seeds but our food source 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.990
 food 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:52.590
 we have always had in the 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.500
 region of the Mesoamerican region a 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.030
 sustenance consider 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:00.190
 of seeds that have allowed us 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:02.129
 feed us for decades by the way 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.280
 we have that special moment in it 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:06.560
 we have to depend 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:11.170
 the improved seeds or seeds 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.170
 genetically engineered that are not 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:24.590
 enough to know its effects 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:29.020
 negative are less than the effects of 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:34.180
 laboratory in which it would be negative 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.180
 costa rica we have a shameful 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:40.410
 with a prominent position in the world 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:43.350
 We are one of the countries where they are most 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:46.110
 uses chemical poisons 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:49.830
 agriculture is a shame because it is 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:52.350
 a country that the image it projects is of 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:55.200
 an ecological country but it is the country with 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.570
 more consumption of chemical poisons and 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:02.250
 worst in the world 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:04.650
 historically and that we must rescue the 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:07.110
 producing our own seeds and 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.030
 native seeds are ideas beaches that 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.980
 They adapt very well to our climates to 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:14.430
 our conditions to inclement 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.960
 of time be drought or two excesses 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.509
 of water 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:21.210
 and contrary to what we are 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:23.250
 offering by selling in the market of 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.380
 trade let's say the ones that are most fragile 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:27.780
 and cost they need a package 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:31.910
 technology that farmers do not know 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.910
 use in costa rica we celebrate 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.420
 in the month of September the 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:38.480
 independence 

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:40.310
 but we can not be independent if we do not 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:44.210
 we have seeds and we do not have meals 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:47.960
 That's why we emphasize as 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:50.479
 the seed at the base of democracy 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:53.060
 seedless without agriculture without food 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:55.720
 there is no independence that's why it's very 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:07:00.229
 important what each family does 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:03.770
 every year is cultivate save 

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:06.229
 seeds exchange seeds do and 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:08.150
 eat of those same products and 

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:10.789
 share the seeds as has been done 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:12.949
 in this celebration that is the basis of 

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:15.400
 our culture that is the basis of the 

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:15.400
 sovereignty 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.030
 in front of
