00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
hip-hop and Gary's so it has a faster 10

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.550 
hip-hop and Gary's so it has a faster 10
good<00:02:30.489> and<00:02:30.849> we<00:02:31.180> know<00:02:31.689> that<00:02:31.720> because<00:02:31.900> we<00:02:32.260> listen

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
good and we know that because we listen

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.690 
good and we know that because we listen
to<00:02:32.680> beats<00:02:32.950> and<00:02:33.310> bars<00:02:33.519> right<00:02:34.230> so<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:36.250> reason<00:02:36.430> we

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
to beats and bars right so the reason we

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.339 
to beats and bars right so the reason we
have<00:02:36.819> to<00:02:36.939> count<00:02:37.090> meet<00:02:37.329> some<00:02:37.540> biases<00:02:37.870> so<00:02:38.079> we<00:02:38.200> can

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
have to count meet some biases so we can

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.440 
have to count meet some biases so we can
a<00:02:38.500> put<00:02:38.739> the<00:02:38.829> right<00:02:39.010> music<00:02:39.159> together<00:02:39.579> yeah
