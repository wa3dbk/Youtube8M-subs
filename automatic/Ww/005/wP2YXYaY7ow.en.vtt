I credit CrossFit to a lot of my
strength<00:03:45.659> gains<00:03:46.019> and<00:03:46.859> I<00:03:47.310> think<00:03:47.579> even<00:03:47.790> just

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
strength gains and I think even just

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.979 
strength gains and I think even just
like<00:03:48.390> kind<00:03:48.810> of<00:03:48.900> like<00:03:49.109> my<00:03:49.319> shoulders<00:03:49.620> and<00:03:50.989> make

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
like kind of like my shoulders and make

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.589 
like kind of like my shoulders and make
just<00:03:52.200> making<00:03:52.439> me<00:03:52.530> stronger<00:03:52.799> overall<00:03:53.129> and<00:03:53.459> more

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
just making me stronger overall and more

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.550 
just making me stronger overall and more
because<00:03:54.599> I<00:03:54.659> think<00:03:54.689> a<00:03:54.840> lot<00:03:54.870> of<00:03:55.019> bodybuilders

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
because I think a lot of bodybuilders

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.490 
because I think a lot of bodybuilders
and<00:03:55.889> people<00:03:56.730> that<00:03:56.790> compete<00:03:57.180> dog<00:03:57.870> CrossFit
