the echo a 2006 that's been on the road

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.310 
the echo a 2006 that's been on the road
for<00:06:31.640> four<00:06:31.820> years<00:06:32.030> it<00:06:32.180> is<00:06:32.210> gonna<00:06:32.420> have<00:06:32.630> some

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:33.320 
for four years it is gonna have some

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.960 
for four years it is gonna have some
little<00:06:33.470> little<00:06:34.010> bits<00:06:34.220> here<00:06:34.310> and<00:06:34.460> there<00:06:34.640> but

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:34.970 
little little bits here and there but

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.960 
little little bits here and there but

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:37.970 
overall I mean you really have to have

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.250 
overall I mean you really have to have
to<00:06:38.150> look<00:06:38.300> close<00:06:38.540> to<00:06:38.690> this<00:06:38.810> car<00:06:39.050> shows

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:39.260 
to look close to this car shows

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.190 
to look close to this car shows
extremely<00:06:40.130> well<00:06:40.280> and<00:06:41.000> only<00:06:41.810> twenty<00:06:42.050> three

extremely well and only twenty three

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.890 
extremely well and only twenty three
thousand<00:06:42.590> kilometers<00:06:42.620> so<00:06:43.310> gives<00:06:44.180> a<00:06:44.330> bit<00:06:44.720> of<00:06:44.750> an

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:44.900 
thousand kilometers so gives a bit of an

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.480 
thousand kilometers so gives a bit of an

indication as to who is owning it and
driving<00:06:46.700> it<00:06:46.880> they<00:06:47.030> really<00:06:47.210> took<00:06:47.300> some<00:06:47.480> pride

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:47.660 
driving it they really took some pride
