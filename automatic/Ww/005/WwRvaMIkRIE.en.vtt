00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
to test a few phone calls with it and

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.390 
to test a few phone calls with it and

but<00:03:36.530> the<00:03:36.650> microphone<00:03:36.980> quality<00:03:37.069> wasn't<00:03:37.489> the

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
but the microphone quality wasn't the

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:39.069 
but the microphone quality wasn't the
