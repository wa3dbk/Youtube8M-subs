I<00:01:00.859> have<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:02.100> high-resolution<00:01:02.879> monitor<00:01:03.359> up<00:01:03.629> in

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
I have a high-resolution monitor up in

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.219 
I have a high-resolution monitor up in
front<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.049> me<00:01:04.700> I'm<00:01:05.700> not<00:01:05.880> sure<00:01:05.939> if<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.570> in

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
front of me I'm not sure if that is in

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.620 
front of me I'm not sure if that is in
focus<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.830> then<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:07.979> have<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.790> 24<00:01:09.270> inches

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
focus and then I have to 24 inches

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.719 
focus and then I have to 24 inches
either<00:01:09.900> side<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.500> think<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.189> 30<00:01:11.490> inch

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
either side I think this is a 30 inch

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.270 
either side I think this is a 30 inch
could<00:01:12.119> be<00:01:12.240> 27<00:01:12.840> I'm<00:01:12.930> not<00:01:13.049> sure<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.830> then<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.130> have

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
could be 27 I'm not sure and then I have

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.910 
could be 27 I'm not sure and then I have
a<00:01:14.310> nm<00:01:15.299> audio<00:01:16.610> project<00:01:17.610> mix<00:01:17.790> IO<00:01:18.439> which<00:01:19.439> these

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
a nm audio project mix IO which these

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.999 
a nm audio project mix IO which these
are<00:01:20.100> automated<00:01:20.729> faders<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.330> if<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.540> was<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:22.009> just

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
are automated faders so if I was to just

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.539 
are automated faders so if I was to just
on<00:01:23.130> my<00:01:23.250> sequencer<00:01:23.820> here<00:01:24.090> if<00:01:24.240> I'm<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:25.159> that<00:01:26.159> so<00:01:26.520> I

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
on my sequencer here if I'm to that so I

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.340 
on my sequencer here if I'm to that so I
move<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.270> volume<00:01:29.210> on<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.270> sequencer<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.140> can

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
move the volume on the sequencer I can

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.760 
move the volume on the sequencer I can
turn<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.619> up<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.770> down<00:01:31.920> on<00:01:32.130> there<00:01:32.310> which<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.180> a

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
turn it up and down on there which is a

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.390 
turn it up and down on there which is a
not<00:01:34.770> necessary<00:01:35.280> but<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.610> know<00:01:37.130> it's<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.220> fun

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
not necessary but you know it's a fun

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.569 
not necessary but you know it's a fun
little<00:01:38.430> thing<00:01:38.820> has<00:01:39.689> eight<00:01:39.900> inputs<00:01:43.220> sure<00:01:44.220> well

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
little thing has eight inputs sure well

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.550 
little thing has eight inputs sure well
this<00:01:44.759> goes<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.270> I'm<00:01:45.360> going<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.540> have<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.750> manual

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
this goes so I'm going to have to manual

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.649 
this goes so I'm going to have to manual
focus<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:47.810> so<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.869> has<00:01:48.960> eight<00:01:49.500> inputs<00:01:50.299> we<00:01:51.299> all

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
focus this so it has eight inputs we all

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.330 
focus this so it has eight inputs we all
have<00:01:51.869> their<00:01:52.020> own<00:01:52.110> independent<00:01:52.680> gain<00:01:52.829> control

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
have their own independent gain control

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.100 
have their own independent gain control
up<00:01:53.700> here<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:55.310> then<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.850> know<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.450> can<00:01:57.719> do<00:01:57.869> like

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
up here and then you know I can do like

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.620 
up here and then you know I can do like
my<00:01:58.350> pause<00:01:59.250> play

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
my pause play

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.480 
my pause play
rewind<00:02:01.439> record<00:02:03.200> etc<00:02:04.200> on<00:02:04.470> there<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.430> will

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
rewind record etc on there and it will

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.710 
rewind record etc on there and it will
see<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:06.180> syncs<00:02:06.900> up<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.520> to<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.640> da<00:02:08.819> W<00:02:09.360> so

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
see that syncs up to the to the da W so

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.570 
see that syncs up to the to the da W so
I<00:02:09.750> can<00:02:10.020> you<00:02:10.560> know<00:02:10.679> move<00:02:10.890> this<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.520> will

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
I can you know move this and it will

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.870

can see the back they will come from
lineout<00:04:21.870> same<00:04:22.140> with<00:04:22.290> the<00:04:22.440> attacher<00:04:22.980> which<00:04:23.280> has

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
lineout same with the attacher which has
