this fireplace kit calls for the pavers

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.029 
this fireplace kit calls for the pavers
to<00:00:27.119> be<00:00:27.240> stacked<00:00:27.570> one<00:00:28.050> on<00:00:28.109> top<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.830> other

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
to be stacked one on top of the other

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.790 
to be stacked one on top of the other
with<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.670> bead<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.210> polyurethane<00:00:30.570> adhesive<00:00:31.140> in

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
with a bead of polyurethane adhesive in

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.920 
with a bead of polyurethane adhesive in
between<00:00:32.399> each<00:00:32.610> layer<00:00:32.910> but<00:00:33.450> fitting<00:00:33.780> them

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
between each layer but fitting them

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.260 
between each layer but fitting them
together<00:00:34.110> seems<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.980> be<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.370> little<00:00:35.730> more<00:00:35.880> like

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
together seems to be a little more like

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.630 
together seems to be a little more like
child's<00:00:36.719> play<00:00:36.750> it's<00:00:37.559> like<00:00:37.739> Legos<00:00:37.980> everything

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
child's play it's like Legos everything

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.700 
child's play it's like Legos everything
all<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.030> based<00:00:39.239> on<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:39.660> one<00:00:39.809> modular<00:00:40.350> at<00:00:40.530> all

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
all is based on that one modular at all

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.139 
all is based on that one modular at all
cute<00:00:41.010> oh<00:00:41.160> no<00:00:41.309> matter<00:00:41.460> how<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.640> turn<00:00:41.879> them<00:00:42.030> they

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
cute oh no matter how you turn them they

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.420 
cute oh no matter how you turn them they
all<00:00:42.270> feel<00:00:42.510> fit<00:00:42.899> same<00:00:43.469> idea<00:00:43.829> here<00:00:44.100> it's<00:00:44.309> all

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
all feel fit same idea here it's all

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.680 
all feel fit same idea here it's all
based<00:00:44.670> on<00:00:44.789> up<00:00:44.910> at<00:00:45.030> three<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.360> half<00:00:45.480> inch

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
based on up at three and a half inch

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.750 
based on up at three and a half inch
modular<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.890> reason<00:00:47.160> we<00:00:47.219> do<00:00:47.340> three<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.670> a

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
modular and the reason we do three and a

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.940 
modular and the reason we do three and a
half<00:00:47.879> inch<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.809> modulates<00:00:49.649> with<00:00:49.829> your

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
half inch is it modulates with your

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.799 
half inch is it modulates with your
dimensional<00:00:50.430> lumber<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.329> can<00:00:51.480> also<00:00:51.629> you

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
dimensional lumber so you can also you

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:52.970 
dimensional lumber so you can also you
know<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.140> right<00:00:52.260> there's<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.620> size<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.920> a

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
know that right there's the size of a

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.670 
know that right there's the size of a
2x4<00:00:53.579> right<00:00:53.940> that's<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.420> size<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.809> 4x4<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.530> you

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
2x4 right that's the size the 4x4 so you

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.410 
2x4 right that's the size the 4x4 so you
incorporate<00:00:56.250> posts<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:56.940> things<00:00:57.120> like<00:00:57.360> that

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
incorporate posts and things like that

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.830 
incorporate posts and things like that
make<00:00:58.050> benches<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.680> whatnot<00:00:59.039> so<00:00:59.640> yeah<00:01:00.210> all

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
make benches and whatnot so yeah all

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.549 
make benches and whatnot so yeah all
works<00:01:01.109> like<00:01:01.289> that

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
works like that

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.049 
works like that
pretty<00:01:02.100> much<00:01:02.219> everything<00:01:02.609> no<00:01:02.730> matter<00:01:02.760> how<00:01:03.000> you

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
pretty much everything no matter how you

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.179 
pretty much everything no matter how you
turn<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.480> it's<00:01:03.570> all<00:01:03.690> gonna<00:01:03.809> fit<00:01:04.290> together<00:01:04.949> the

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
turn it it's all gonna fit together the

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.609 
turn it it's all gonna fit together the
process<00:01:05.850> really<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.570> pretty<00:01:06.840> simple<00:01:07.140> but

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
process really is pretty simple but

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.320 
process really is pretty simple but
these<00:01:07.770> guys<00:01:08.100> were<00:01:08.340> able<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.729> show<00:01:09.030> us<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.299> few

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
these guys were able to show us a few

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.660 
these guys were able to show us a few
tricks<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:09.930> might<00:01:10.320> not<00:01:10.560> be<00:01:10.740> apparent<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.430> the

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
tricks that might not be apparent to the

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.880 
tricks that might not be apparent to the
casual<00:01:12.180> observer<00:01:12.320> ceiling<00:01:13.320> this<00:01:13.380> block<00:01:13.650> it's

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
casual observer ceiling this block it's

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.320 
casual observer ceiling this block it's
got<00:01:14.070> these<00:01:14.189> little<00:01:14.460> marks<00:01:14.729> on<00:01:14.850> them<00:01:15.000> those<00:01:15.210> are

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
got these little marks on them those are

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.880 
got these little marks on them those are
called<00:01:15.479> swipe<00:01:15.780> marks<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.409> that's<00:01:16.590> when<00:01:16.770> the

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
called swipe marks and that's when the

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.560 
called swipe marks and that's when the
block<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.220> actually<00:01:17.700> be<00:01:17.909> molded<00:01:18.330> from<00:01:18.450> the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
block is actually be molded from the

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.840 
block is actually be molded from the
factory<00:01:18.990> right<00:01:19.259> there<00:01:20.040> we<00:01:20.580> want<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.790> pay

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
factory right there we want to pay

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.980 
factory right there we want to pay
attention<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.420> when<00:01:21.540> we're<00:01:21.659> doing<00:01:21.780> this

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
attention to is when we're doing this

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.539 
attention to is when we're doing this
course<00:01:22.259> like<00:01:22.470> we're<00:01:22.680> doing<00:01:22.799> here<00:01:23.070> we<00:01:23.220> want<00:01:23.430> to

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
course like we're doing here we want to

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.340 
course like we're doing here we want to
lay<00:01:23.670> these<00:01:23.820> blocks<00:01:24.210> vertically<00:01:25.080> like<00:01:25.320> this

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
lay these blocks vertically like this

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.170 
lay these blocks vertically like this
but<00:01:25.830> we<00:01:25.920> want<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.250> swipe<00:01:26.610> mark<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.060> be

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
but we want that swipe mark to be

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.270 
but we want that swipe mark to be
horizontal<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.960> ground<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.770> reason<00:01:29.159> for

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
horizontal to the ground the reason for

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.530 
horizontal to the ground the reason for
that<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.640> gives<00:01:29.820> us<00:01:29.970> our<00:01:30.090> most<00:01:30.360> consistent

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
that that gives us our most consistent

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.350 
that that gives us our most consistent
height<00:01:31.229> in<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.710> block<00:01:31.920> okay<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:32.700> as<00:01:32.850> we<00:01:33.000> go<00:01:33.150> up

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
height in the block okay so as we go up

from getting off from blocks being just

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.690 
from getting off from blocks being just
a<00:01:37.049> little<00:01:37.079> bit<00:01:37.530> out<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.950> dementia<00:01:38.369> that
