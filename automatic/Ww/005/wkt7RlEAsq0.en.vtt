thanks to a small addition in the latest

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.840 
thanks to a small addition in the latest
snapshot<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:02.440> small<00:01:02.710> addition<00:01:03.100> but<00:01:03.400> it<00:01:03.460> makes

snapshot the small addition but it makes

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.000 
snapshot the small addition but it makes
so<00:01:04.180> many<00:01:04.449> things<00:01:04.809> possible<00:01:05.260> so<00:01:05.560> let's<00:01:05.740> have<00:01:05.950> a

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
so many things possible so let's have a

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.730 
so many things possible so let's have a
closer<00:01:06.310> look<00:01:06.430> at<00:01:06.670> what<00:01:06.940> happens<00:01:07.270> here

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.820 

in<00:01:10.250> 14<00:01:10.940> w20<00:01:11.840> we<00:01:12.049> got<00:01:12.200> the<00:01:12.320> addition<00:01:12.680> of

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
in 14 w20 we got the addition of

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.030 
in 14 w20 we got the addition of
selectors<00:01:13.549> inside<00:01:14.150> Tarot<00:01:14.630> commands<00:01:15.229> which

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
selectors inside Tarot commands which

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.680 
selectors inside Tarot commands which
means<00:01:16.280> we<00:01:16.460> can<00:01:16.640> now<00:01:16.760> target<00:01:16.820> individual

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
means we can now target individual

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.649 
means we can now target individual
players<00:01:17.990> and<00:01:18.350> print<00:01:18.890> out<00:01:19.010> their<00:01:19.280> names<00:01:19.659> which

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
players and print out their names which

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:22.840 
players and print out their names which
might<00:01:20.840> be<00:01:20.960> used<00:01:21.110> for<00:01:21.500> maybe<00:01:21.979> high<00:01:22.190> scores<00:01:22.610> or

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
might be used for maybe high scores or

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.789 
might be used for maybe high scores or
different<00:01:23.540> messages<00:01:24.020> specific<00:01:24.590> for

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
different messages specific for

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.280 
different messages specific for
different<00:01:25.070> players<00:01:25.630> things<00:01:26.630> that<00:01:26.990> weren't

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
different players things that weren't

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.560 
different players things that weren't
possible<00:01:27.560> with<00:01:28.040> just<00:01:28.400> a<00:01:28.580> say<00:01:28.790> comment<00:01:29.240> or<00:01:29.420> the

more you can do let's look at this

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.180 
more you can do let's look at this
two<00:01:35.479> identical<00:01:35.750> command<00:01:36.590> blocks<00:01:36.890> with

in<00:01:46.220> the<00:01:46.310> commander<00:01:46.729> said<00:01:46.940> identical<00:01:47.899> commands

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
in the commander said identical commands

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.100 
in the commander said identical commands
which<00:01:49.190> target<00:01:49.640> the<00:01:49.789> nearest<00:01:50.210> non<00:01:50.750> player

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
which target the nearest non player

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.499 
which target the nearest non player
entity<00:01:51.590> and<00:01:52.340> if<00:01:52.490> we<00:01:52.580> look<00:01:52.759> down<00:01:52.789> here<00:01:53.000> we<00:01:53.390> have

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
entity and if we look down here we have

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:56.050 
entity and if we look down here we have
one<00:01:53.810> squid<00:01:54.140> called<00:01:54.470> I<00:01:54.619> am<00:01:54.800> text<00:01:55.220> and<00:01:55.429> one<00:01:55.759> squid

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
I'm not so this command block will

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.660 
I'm not so this command block will
output<00:01:59.690> the<00:01:59.840> name<00:02:00.020> of<00:02:00.289> that<00:02:00.740> square<00:02:01.159> down<00:02:01.340> here

output the name of I am text and the
best<00:02:07.640> part<00:02:07.850> is<00:02:08.000> we're<00:02:08.600> not<00:02:08.690> limited<00:02:09.050> to<00:02:09.080> one

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
best part is we're not limited to one

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.380 
best part is we're not limited to one
selector<00:02:09.860> Patera<00:02:10.280> we<00:02:10.640> can<00:02:10.819> combine<00:02:11.030> several

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
selector Patera we can combine several

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.900 
selector Patera we can combine several
so<00:02:12.290> for<00:02:12.440> example<00:02:12.800> now<00:02:13.010> I<00:02:13.040> can<00:02:13.280> combine<00:02:13.489> the

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
so for example now I can combine the

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.270 
so for example now I can combine the
selector<00:02:14.390> for<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.870> newest<00:02:15.049> player<00:02:15.320> and<00:02:15.620> for

selector for the newest player and for

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.910

the<00:02:16.400> nearest<00:02:16.640> non<00:02:17.150> player<00:02:17.480> and<00:02:17.870> give<00:02:18.709> order

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
the nearest non player and give order

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.160 
the nearest non player and give order
text<00:02:19.160> like<00:02:19.280> this

this<00:02:21.800> means<00:02:22.040> that<00:02:22.400> instead<00:02:22.790> of<00:02:22.910> creating<00:02:23.390> one

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
this means that instead of creating one

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.050 
this means that instead of creating one
command<00:02:24.410> block<00:02:24.500> for<00:02:24.980> each<00:02:25.190> single<00:02:25.580> output

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
a few command blocks and would recombine

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.670 
a few command blocks and would recombine
