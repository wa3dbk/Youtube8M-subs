00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.539 
only got one star on to attack so that's
a<00:01:48.329> bit<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.869> shame<00:01:49.140> right<00:01:49.799> now<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.159> has<00:01:50.310> been

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
a bit of a shame right now it has been

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.010 
a bit of a shame right now it has been
pretty<00:01:50.759> good<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.180> consistent<00:01:51.479> through<00:01:51.899> the

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
pretty good and consistent through the

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.219 
pretty good and consistent through the
wards<00:01:52.290> he's<00:01:52.770> been<00:01:52.920> gangs<00:01:53.130> from<00:01:53.430> 46<00:01:54.090> stars<00:01:54.360> so<00:01:55.200> I

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
wards he's been gangs from 46 stars so I

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.420 
wards he's been gangs from 46 stars so I
that's<00:01:55.649> why<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:55.799> put<00:01:55.950> him<00:01:56.040> in<00:01:56.070> this<00:01:56.159> where<00:01:56.340> he

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
that's why I put him in this where he

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.639 
that's why I put him in this where he
struggled<00:01:56.610> his<00:01:56.880> first<00:01:57.060> attack<00:01:57.469> barely<00:01:58.469> gained

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
struggled his first attack barely gained

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.459 
struggled his first attack barely gained
the<00:01:58.740> two<00:01:58.890> star<00:01:59.630> polymorphic<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.899> don't<00:02:01.320> think

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
the two star polymorphic I don't think

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.690 
the two star polymorphic I don't think
he's<00:02:01.590> going<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.740> use<00:02:01.860> both<00:02:02.040> both<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.640> his

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
he's going to use both both of his

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.889 
he's going to use both both of his
attacks<00:02:03.000> so<00:02:03.210> he's<00:02:03.329> probably<00:02:03.450> not<00:02:03.659> going<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.840> be

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
attacks so he's probably not going to be

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.380 
attacks so he's probably not going to be
the<00:02:04.020> next<00:02:04.140> whore<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.880> mean<00:02:05.880> yeah<00:02:05.939> this<00:02:06.149> guy<00:02:06.329> who

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
the next whore I mean yeah this guy who

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.990 
the next whore I mean yeah this guy who
hasn't<00:02:06.689> used<00:02:06.899> this<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.170> attacks<00:02:07.439> yet<00:02:08.000> there's
