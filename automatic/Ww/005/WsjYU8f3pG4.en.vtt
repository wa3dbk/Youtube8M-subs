00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.910

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.710
 social 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.390
 when it gets close the crowd will not 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.519
 posting Christmas phrases when you arrive is from 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.500
 Easter someone please can you tell me 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:33.059
 a Christmas phrase that is not clichÃ© 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.000
 What are you doing there for the Christmas spirit? 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.399

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.840

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.760

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.859

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.180
 television specials to start anyone 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.129
 At least nobody watches that I 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.090
 I know to watch a Christmas day that goes 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.939
 want to stay in front of the television 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.200

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:13.530
 Leave it suck the rui paiva I got there and 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:16.320

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.450
 easier if years and years the person home 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.600

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.600

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.600
 because your grandfather talents 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.580

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.440

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.000

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.860

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.300

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.210
 food now I know with the feeling that 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.340
 the beggars when they will order food 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.020

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.610
 cannibal because they do not have as when 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.560
 People are hungry there. 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.960

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.820

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.400
 when the first sumbe appeared 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.760

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.050

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.050
 Then he started eating uff brains. 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.690
 to close could not miss that 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.340
 annoying christmas song what the 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.960
 then gave birth more when they are those 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:56.260
 little figures on duty before Santa 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:58.330
 Look at this little bit to close the year. 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.070
 seriously speaking has more annoying music 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.780
 that jingle bells have never seen anyone 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.970
 passing with the normal sound car for 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.740
 there playing for goubel I was never a 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.140

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:12.420

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.420
 noel should play all this from gogo girls 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:25.660

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.790

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.770
 underneath, it helps fucking spreading 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.330
 And then I like it when I see a side. 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.680
 the more I'm increasingly 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.930
 motivated to continue doing my 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.580

 red sign up motivates me a lot 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.690
 also every time I look there and have a 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.550
 number of enrollees is greater than what 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.630

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.630
