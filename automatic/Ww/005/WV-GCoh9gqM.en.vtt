 I let you know if I have Spanish 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.860

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:48.780
 then a lipstick 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.609

 You're back and I'm back home again 

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:32.909
 i hope i have my spanish today 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:34.199
 would get figures from the engine that it 

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:36.360
 the first lesson of spanish after the 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:38.220
 exam week but now have another 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.960
 teacher because we have this period and 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.280
 Spanish oral have totally drama 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.229
 but good being because of that we had ours 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.830
 key not yet for me can pass over 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:45.599
 three weeks 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.830
 but well then you get to next week 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:48.630
 somewhere a figure because it comes 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.220
 just being on the internet was a lot 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.020
 curious but had good fun at school 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.990
 she was really super there today 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.530
 and now we go 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:58.480
 to go eat pasta tasty so nice I have 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.150
 just a moment with tamara called my 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.040
 classmate with whom I go to Prague after 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.840
 the summer vacation and we found out 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.820
 that our master in prague pass on 1 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.560
 October starts and both had completely 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.270
 niels head that we there September 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.440
 would start because in the Netherlands 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.040
 the schools also simply start on 1 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.530
 September 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.240
 but there's been so and was an October 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.890
 actually another month longer 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.240
 yes prepare us for the village and 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.160
 actually a month longer summer 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.960
 vacation because then we can just half 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.750
 demand for such a direction in September and 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.800
 then we can sort everything out and watch 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.910
 of course there are none yet 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.800
 concrete but we have 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.330
 Today we had a message about us 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.760
 can sign up because we are then say 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.560
 but it is a whole procedure 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:39.100
 we are already selected for 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.030
 Prague and then there were already very happy 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.730
 with it 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:45.070
 And now is now about 5 weeks later 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:47.290

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:51.400
