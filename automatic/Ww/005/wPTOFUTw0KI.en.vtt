just<00:01:36.420> have<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.600> racks<00:01:36.869> as<00:01:37.079> well<00:01:37.229> as<00:01:37.320> that

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
just have the racks as well as that

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.870 
just have the racks as well as that
refinery<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:37.979> production<00:01:38.430> so<00:01:38.549> we<00:01:38.640> can<00:01:38.759> see

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
refinery in production so we can see

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.969 
refinery in production so we can see
that<00:01:39.000> probe<00:01:39.240> an<00:01:39.329> SUV<00:01:39.600> scalp<00:01:39.930> both<00:01:40.320> passing

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
that probe an SUV scalp both passing

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.319 
that probe an SUV scalp both passing

each other on the way to the opposing
players<00:01:42.540> base<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.079> here<00:01:43.439> we<00:01:43.530> go<00:01:43.590> stock<00:01:43.890> moving

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
players base and here we go stock moving

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.740 
players base and here we go stock moving
right<00:01:44.310> on<00:01:44.399> in<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.700> do<00:01:44.759> expect<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.299> little<00:01:45.570> bit<00:01:45.659> of

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
right on in I do expect a little bit of

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.510 
right on in I do expect a little bit of
SCV<00:01:46.020> her<00:01:46.259> ass<00:01:46.439> here<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:47.070> there<00:01:47.220> we<00:01:47.280> go<00:01:47.310> the

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
SCV her ass here so there we go the

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.130 
SCV her ass here so there we go the
probe<00:01:47.729> will<00:01:47.939> be<00:01:48.030> engaging<00:01:48.329> that<00:01:48.540> SUV<00:01:48.869> getting

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
probe will be engaging that SUV getting

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.660 
probe will be engaging that SUV getting
a<00:01:49.200> few<00:01:49.320> shots<00:01:49.530> off<00:01:49.799> but<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.100> course<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.399> little

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
a few shots off but of course a little

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.760 
a few shots off but of course a little
one<00:01:50.790> being<00:01:51.479> fully<00:01:51.720> prepared<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.320> able<00:01:52.439> to

one being fully prepared and able to

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.929 
one being fully prepared and able to
deal<00:01:52.920> with<00:01:53.070> this<00:01:53.159> type<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.369> her<00:01:53.549> ass<00:01:53.640> pulling

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
deal with this type of her ass pulling

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.910 
deal with this type of her ass pulling
down<00:01:54.180> with<00:01:54.360> his<00:01:54.509> SUV<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:55.110> try<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.350> engage<00:01:55.680> that

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
down with his SUV to try to engage that

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.709 
down with his SUV to try to engage that
probe<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.430> then<00:01:56.850> he<00:01:56.939> should<00:01:57.090> be<00:01:57.180> pulling<00:01:57.420> back

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
probe and then he should be pulling back

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.510 
probe and then he should be pulling back
because<00:01:58.350> as<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.710> probe<00:01:58.920> recharges<00:01:59.399> his

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
because as that probe recharges his

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.950 
because as that probe recharges his
shields<00:01:59.909> he<00:02:00.000> will<00:02:00.149> be<00:02:00.240> happy<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.689> turn<00:02:00.810> around

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
shields he will be happy to turn around

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.139 
shields he will be happy to turn around
and<00:02:01.229> engage<00:02:01.590> now<00:02:02.130> back<00:02:02.310> over<00:02:02.460> here<00:02:02.610> inside<00:02:03.000> of

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
and engage now back over here inside of

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.429 
and engage now back over here inside of
socks<00:02:03.360> maybe<00:02:03.570> base<00:02:03.719> we<00:02:03.869> can't<00:02:04.110> see<00:02:04.320> the

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
socks maybe base we can't see the

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.899 
socks maybe base we can't see the
gateways<00:02:04.770> up<00:02:05.040> but<00:02:05.189> they're<00:02:05.340> real<00:02:05.460> finally

dropping<00:02:06.149> down<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:06.540> cybernetics<00:02:07.020> core<00:02:07.200> just

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
dropping down that cybernetics core just

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.710 
dropping down that cybernetics core just
a<00:02:07.920> tad<00:02:08.160> bit<00:02:08.340> later<00:02:08.550> than<00:02:08.729> he<00:02:08.849> could<00:02:09.000> have<00:02:09.149> had

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
a tad bit later than he could have had

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.300 
a tad bit later than he could have had
about<00:02:09.869> 30<00:02:10.170> extra<00:02:10.410> resources<00:02:10.890> when<00:02:11.069> he<00:02:11.160> did

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
about 30 extra resources when he did

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.589 
about 30 extra resources when he did
drop<00:02:11.520> that<00:02:11.670> down<00:02:11.849> so<00:02:12.060> we<00:02:12.120> could<00:02:12.239> have<00:02:12.360> got<00:02:12.450> down

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
drop that down so we could have got down

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.370 
drop that down so we could have got down
a<00:02:12.629> little<00:02:12.930> bit

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380
