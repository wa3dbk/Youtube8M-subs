00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
should all hit them with

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.910 
should all hit them with
the<00:02:06.270> same<00:02:06.570> game<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.200> moment<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.650> start

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
the same game the moment you start

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.980 
the same game the moment you start
hitting<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.400> girl<00:02:08.580> with<00:02:08.880> the<00:02:09.000> special<00:02:09.450> game<00:02:09.690> is

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
hitting a girl with the special game is

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.480 
hitting a girl with the special game is
the<00:02:10.170> moment<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.800> get<00:02:10.950> farther<00:02:11.280> away

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
the moment that you get farther away

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.670 
the moment that you get farther away
from<00:02:11.790> her<00:02:11.910> that<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:13.020> don't<00:02:13.200> get<00:02:13.410> what<00:02:13.650> you

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680
