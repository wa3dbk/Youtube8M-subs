that's<00:01:45.570> why<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.780> game's<00:01:46.020> not<00:01:46.200> called<00:01:46.500> sonic

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
that's why the game's not called sonic

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.639 
that's why the game's not called sonic
and<00:01:47.520> sega<00:01:47.790> all-stars<00:01:48.180> racing<00:01:48.869> transformed

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
it's just called all-stars racing

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.020 
it's just called all-stars racing
transformed<00:01:52.409> so<00:01:53.100> it's<00:01:53.280> um<00:01:53.520> it's<00:01:53.850> pretty

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
I'm not so sure if they're really gonna

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:59.289 
I'm not so sure if they're really gonna
go<00:03:57.230> with<00:03:57.440> the<00:03:57.819> now<00:03:58.819> you<00:03:58.880> can<00:03:59.030> play<00:03:59.180> his

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299

knuckles and Tails type of thing um

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.880 
knuckles and Tails type of thing um
maybe<00:04:02.690> that's<00:04:03.049> why<00:04:03.230> they're<00:04:03.410> making<00:04:03.709> the

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
maybe that's why they're making the

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.970 
maybe that's why they're making the
sonic<00:04:04.519> adventure<00:04:04.850> 2<00:04:05.000> re-release<00:04:05.510> now<00:04:05.980> whom

sonic adventure 2 re-release now whom
really<00:04:07.549> i<00:04:07.579> really<00:04:07.730> don't<00:04:08.269> know<00:04:08.359> for<00:04:08.750> sure<00:04:08.780> but

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
really i really don't know for sure but

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.069 
really i really don't know for sure but
um<00:04:09.859> that's<00:04:10.190> my<00:04:10.340> speculation<00:04:11.180> but<00:04:11.329> right<00:04:11.900> now

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
um that's my speculation but right now

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:13.960 
um that's my speculation but right now
the<00:04:12.139> psychometric<00:04:12.920> three<00:04:13.160> domains<00:04:13.489> aren't

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
the psychometric three domains aren't

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.970 
the psychometric three domains aren't
registered<00:04:14.780> by<00:04:14.959> someone<00:04:15.470> maybe<00:04:15.709> it's<00:04:15.889> someone

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
registered by someone maybe it's someone

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.580 
registered by someone maybe it's someone
doing<00:04:16.340> a<00:04:16.549> trolling<00:04:17.030> the<00:04:17.209> entire<00:04:17.570> internet<00:04:18.109> and
