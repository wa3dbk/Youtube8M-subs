i<00:03:26.730> may<00:03:26.970> just<00:03:27.000> look<00:03:27.420> at<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:27.750> tech<00:03:28.080> right<00:03:28.560> there

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
i may just look at the tech right there

really<00:03:47.610> good<00:03:47.760> as<00:03:47.880> well<00:03:47.910> because<00:03:48.330> he<00:03:48.420> has<00:03:48.540> high

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
really good as well because he has high

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.900 
really good as well because he has high
agility<00:03:48.989> and<00:03:49.650> she'd<00:03:49.860> be<00:03:49.950> high<00:03:50.130> high

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
agility and she'd be high high

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
acceleration his sprint speed is have

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.710 
acceleration his sprint speed is have
been<00:03:53.250> on<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:53.430> lower<00:03:53.610> side<00:03:53.910> but<00:03:54.239> his

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
been on the lower side but his

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.300 
been on the lower side but his
acceleration<00:03:55.200> more<00:03:55.620> than<00:03:55.799> makes<00:03:55.950> up<00:03:56.100> for<00:03:56.160> that

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
acceleration more than makes up for that

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.100 
acceleration more than makes up for that
just<00:03:56.610> because<00:03:56.910> once<00:03:57.390> he<00:03:57.480> has<00:03:57.570> that<00:03:57.720> big<00:03:57.900> burst

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
just because once he has that big burst

just because once he has that big burst
of<00:03:58.230> speed<00:03:58.700> defenders<00:03:59.700> are<00:03:59.730> gonna<00:03:59.910> have<00:04:00.030> a<00:04:00.090> hard

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
of speed defenders are gonna have a hard

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:01.280 
of speed defenders are gonna have a hard
time<00:04:00.450> trying<00:04:00.630> to<00:04:00.720> catch<00:04:00.900> up<00:04:00.930> with<00:04:01.080> them

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
time trying to catch up with them

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.750 
time trying to catch up with them
anyways<00:04:01.680> because<00:04:01.920> bout<00:04:02.310> time<00:04:02.489> they<00:04:02.580> reach

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
anyways because bout time they reach

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.460 
anyways because bout time they reach
their<00:04:02.880> full<00:04:03.090> sprint<00:04:03.360> speed<00:04:03.540> he's<00:04:04.170> kinda

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
their full sprint speed he's kinda

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.380 
their full sprint speed he's kinda
already<00:04:04.560> passed<00:04:05.100> everybody<00:04:05.519> so<00:04:05.940> that's<00:04:06.209> one

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
already passed everybody so that's one

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.729 
already passed everybody so that's one
thing<00:04:06.510> I<00:04:06.630> definitely<00:04:06.690> like<00:04:07.230> about<00:04:07.470> him<00:04:07.560> and

thing I definitely like about him and
overall<00:04:08.370> I<00:04:08.400> mean<00:04:08.640> he<00:04:08.790> was<00:04:08.940> just<00:04:09.120> a<00:04:09.209> really

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
overall I mean he was just a really

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.420 
overall I mean he was just a really
excellent<00:04:09.930> player<00:04:10.709> and<00:04:10.860> look<00:04:10.950> at<00:04:11.070> that<00:04:11.190> shot

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
excellent player and look at that shot

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.580 
excellent player and look at that shot
right<00:04:11.610> there<00:04:11.640> just<00:04:11.970> absolutely<00:04:12.570> saying<00:04:12.930> only

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
right there just absolutely saying only

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.949 
right there just absolutely saying only
uh<00:04:13.739> the<00:04:14.250> only<00:04:14.430> downside<00:04:14.700> with<00:04:15.390> them<00:04:15.540> it's

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
uh the only downside with them it's

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.719 
uh the only downside with them it's
really<00:04:16.200> that<00:04:16.350> he<00:04:16.440> has<00:04:16.590> to<00:04:16.890> start<00:04:17.190> weak<00:04:17.459> foot

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
really that he has to start weak foot

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.509 
really that he has to start weak foot
and<00:04:17.880> that<00:04:18.239> he<00:04:18.390> is<00:04:18.540> still<00:04:18.959> a<00:04:18.989> bit<00:04:19.260> weak<00:04:19.290> so<00:04:20.100> over

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
and that he is still a bit weak so over

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.920 
and that he is still a bit weak so over
I<00:04:20.549> mean<00:04:20.850> this<00:04:20.940> guy<00:04:21.150> was<00:04:21.180> really<00:04:21.540> great

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
I mean this guy was really great

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.900 
I mean this guy was really great
considering<00:04:22.620> as<00:04:22.740> a<00:04:22.770> 70k<00:04:23.160> difference<00:04:23.669> with

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
considering as a 70k difference with

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.460 
considering as a 70k difference with
them<00:04:24.090> I<00:04:24.300> would<00:04:24.599> definitely<00:04:24.810> suggest<00:04:25.140> getting

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
them I would definitely suggest getting

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.930 
them I would definitely suggest getting
just<00:04:25.830> getting<00:04:26.070> a<00:04:26.099> second<00:04:26.460> and<00:04:26.580> form<00:04:26.760> just

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
just getting a second and form just

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.210 
just getting a second and form just
because

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
because

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.760 
because
you're<00:04:27.880> paying<00:04:28.180> a<00:04:28.300> 70k<00:04:28.630> difference<00:04:29.170> but<00:04:29.650> he

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
you're paying a 70k difference but he

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.410 
you're paying a 70k difference but he
feels<00:04:30.010> even<00:04:30.220> better<00:04:30.400> if<00:04:30.760> you<00:04:30.880> ask<00:04:31.090> me<00:04:31.240> I<00:04:31.300> me

feels even better if you ask me I me

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.390 
feels even better if you ask me I me
driven<00:04:32.140> why's<00:04:32.290> he<00:04:32.410> feels<00:04:32.650> very<00:04:32.950> excellent

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
driven why's he feels very excellent
