00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
think but in this case no I don't think

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.850 
think but in this case no I don't think
so<00:01:52.860> but<00:01:53.930> why<00:01:54.930> would<00:01:55.110> they<00:01:55.200> use<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.380> commercial

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860

vehicle you know if it was such was so

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.490 
vehicle you know if it was such was so
important<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.270> dangerous<00:02:00.570> why<00:02:01.079> would<00:02:01.409> you

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
establishment is preparing for this

thing<00:02:51.800> isn't<00:02:52.800> that<00:02:53.100> kind<00:02:53.370> of<00:02:53.459> interesting<00:02:54.380> now

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
thing isn't that kind of interesting now

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.710 
thing isn't that kind of interesting now
the<00:02:55.440> question<00:02:55.650> here<00:02:56.100> is<00:02:56.510> if<00:02:57.510> the

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
the question here is if the

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.199 
the question here is if the
establishment<00:02:58.530> is<00:02:58.740> working<00:02:59.490> to<00:02:59.610> try<00:02:59.790> to<00:02:59.850> wipe

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
establishment is working to try to wipe

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.330 
establishment is working to try to wipe
out<00:03:00.390> most<00:03:00.630> of<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:01.140> population<00:03:01.650> in<00:03:01.950> it<00:03:02.070> and

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
out most of the population in it and

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.180 
out most of the population in it and
they're<00:03:02.459> doing<00:03:02.670> this<00:03:02.730> intentionally<00:03:04.190> what

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
they're doing this intentionally what

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.040 
they're doing this intentionally what
why<00:03:05.580> on<00:03:05.820> earth<00:03:07.640> would<00:03:08.640> they<00:03:08.880> be<00:03:09.180> preparing<00:03:09.840> the

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
why on earth would they be preparing the

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.670 
why on earth would they be preparing the
medical<00:03:10.560> establishment<00:03:10.680> for<00:03:11.580> it<00:03:12.470> it<00:03:13.470> just

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
medical establishment for it it just

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.300 
medical establishment for it it just
doesn't<00:03:13.860> make<00:03:14.010> a<00:03:14.130> lot<00:03:14.340> of<00:03:14.400> sense<00:03:14.519> you<00:03:15.060> know<00:03:16.310> and

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
doesn't make a lot of sense you know and

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.460 
doesn't make a lot of sense you know and
it's<00:03:17.459> a<00:03:17.550> lot<00:03:17.700> of<00:03:17.850> evidence<00:03:17.970> to<00:03:18.300> the<00:03:19.170> links<00:03:19.440> that

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
it's a lot of evidence to the links that

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.430 
it's a lot of evidence to the links that
I<00:03:19.590> have<00:03:19.860> to<00:03:20.580> show<00:03:20.790> that<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:21.239> american<00:03:21.870> medical

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
I have to show that the american medical

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.090 
I have to show that the american medical
establishments<00:03:23.400> also<00:03:23.700> being<00:03:23.910> prepared<00:03:24.269> and

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
establishments also being prepared and

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.080 
establishments also being prepared and
again<00:03:26.100> that<00:03:26.910> just<00:03:27.120> doesn't<00:03:27.209> add<00:03:27.450> up<00:03:27.769> now<00:03:29.090> Bush

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
again that just doesn't add up now Bush

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.090 
again that just doesn't add up now Bush
did<00:03:30.810> say<00:03:31.080> that<00:03:31.350> in<00:03:31.890> the<00:03:32.340> event<00:03:32.459> of<00:03:33.019> a<00:03:34.100> deadly

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
did say that in the event of a deadly

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.720 
did say that in the event of a deadly
flu<00:03:35.489> epidemic<00:03:36.350> he<00:03:37.350> would<00:03:37.590> use<00:03:37.920> troops<00:03:38.489> to

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
flu epidemic he would use troops to

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.030 
flu epidemic he would use troops to
impose<00:03:39.030> a<00:03:39.060> quarantine<00:03:39.620> and<00:03:40.620> that<00:03:40.739> makes<00:03:40.890> me

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
impose a quarantine and that makes me

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.699 
impose a quarantine and that makes me
kind<00:03:41.310> of<00:03:41.340> wonder<00:03:41.400> book<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:41.820> painting<00:03:42.090> camps<00:03:42.420> I

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
kind of wonder book to painting camps I

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.910 
kind of wonder book to painting camps I
mean<00:03:43.709> I<00:03:44.660> don't<00:03:45.660> I<00:03:45.930> don't<00:03:46.019> maybe<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.709> whole

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
mean I don't I don't maybe the whole

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.350 
mean I don't I don't maybe the whole
Fema<00:03:47.220> camp<00:03:47.250> they<00:03:47.550> hasn't<00:03:47.820> been<00:03:47.910> proven<00:03:48.150> yet

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
Fema camp they hasn't been proven yet

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.910 
Fema camp they hasn't been proven yet
but<00:03:48.720> there's<00:03:48.900> a<00:03:48.930> lot<00:03:49.140> of<00:03:49.170> evidence<00:03:50.030> for<00:03:51.030> that

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
but there's a lot of evidence for that

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.650 
but there's a lot of evidence for that
so<00:03:52.920> that<00:03:53.730> kinda<00:03:53.970> makes<00:03:54.030> me<00:03:54.150> wonder<00:03:54.390> if<00:03:54.630> the

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
so that kinda makes me wonder if the

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.449 
so that kinda makes me wonder if the
FEMA<00:03:54.930> camps<00:03:55.260> are<00:03:55.560> being<00:03:55.769> prepared<00:03:56.160> is<00:03:56.400> a

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
FEMA camps are being prepared is a

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.050 
FEMA camps are being prepared is a
quarantine<00:03:56.910> the<00:03:57.570> quarantine<00:03:58.110> centers<00:03:59.060> and

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
quarantine the quarantine centers and

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.420 
quarantine the quarantine centers and
all<00:04:00.209> these<00:04:00.330> coffin<00:04:01.140> liners<00:04:01.440> and<00:04:01.650> stuff<00:04:01.860> you

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
all these coffin liners and stuff you

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.970 
all these coffin liners and stuff you
know<00:04:02.550> maybe<00:04:03.060> it's<00:04:03.239> not<00:04:03.390> to<00:04:03.720> do<00:04:03.930> with<00:04:03.959> a<00:04:04.500> nuclear

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
know maybe it's not to do with a nuclear

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.050 
know maybe it's not to do with a nuclear
war<00:04:05.160> harder<00:04:05.400> that<00:04:05.519> just<00:04:05.700> didn't<00:04:05.910> make<00:04:05.940> any

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
war harder that just didn't make any

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.479 
war harder that just didn't make any
sense<00:04:06.239> to<00:04:06.510> me<00:04:06.600> but<00:04:07.590> you<00:04:07.650> know<00:04:07.830> make<00:04:08.220> a<00:04:08.310> lot<00:04:08.459> more

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
sense to me but you know make a lot more

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:09.800 
sense to me but you know make a lot more
sense<00:04:08.880> if<00:04:09.060> they're<00:04:09.120> expecting<00:04:09.480> people<00:04:09.540> die

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
sense if they're expecting people die

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.050 
sense if they're expecting people die
from<00:04:09.840> some<00:04:10.230> kind<00:04:10.410> of<00:04:10.530> sickness<00:04:11.010> and<00:04:11.730> again<00:04:11.970> I'm

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
from some kind of sickness and again I'm

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.240 
from some kind of sickness and again I'm
not<00:04:12.090> saying<00:04:12.630> for<00:04:12.720> sure<00:04:12.900> that<00:04:13.350> this<00:04:13.830> is<00:04:14.040> not

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
not saying for sure that this is not

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
to find a cure for the problem so if if

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.530 
to find a cure for the problem so if if
there's<00:04:57.860> a<00:04:57.890> small<00:04:58.190> amount<00:04:58.550> you<00:04:59.030> know<00:04:59.150> and

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
there's a small amount you know and

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:04.150 
there's a small amount you know and
small<00:04:59.990> well<00:05:00.320> I<00:05:00.350> don't<00:05:00.500> know<00:05:02.860> and<00:05:03.860> I<00:05:03.950> guess<00:05:04.070> I

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
small well I don't know and I guess I

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.410 
small well I don't know and I guess I
could<00:05:04.310> show<00:05:04.400> how<00:05:04.490> to<00:05:04.550> judge<00:05:04.820> that<00:05:05.030> there's

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.420 
could show how to judge that there's

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.450 
could show how to judge that there's
only<00:05:05.570> law<00:05:05.840> of<00:05:06.200> pounds<00:05:06.770> I<00:05:06.950> mean<00:05:07.130> if<00:05:07.250> there's

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
only law of pounds I mean if there's

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.000 
only law of pounds I mean if there's
tons<00:05:07.790> and<00:05:08.030> tons<00:05:08.240> of<00:05:08.570> of<00:05:08.810> this<00:05:09.440> stuff<00:05:09.710> going

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
tons and tons of of this stuff going

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.440 
tons and tons of of this stuff going
through<00:05:10.190> it<00:05:10.310> and<00:05:10.400> that's<00:05:10.550> very<00:05:10.760> suspicious

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
through it and that's very suspicious

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.990 
through it and that's very suspicious
you<00:05:11.720> know<00:05:11.780> obviously<00:05:12.700> but<00:05:13.700> it<00:05:13.730> kind<00:05:13.970> of

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
you know obviously but it kind of

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.340 
you know obviously but it kind of
depends<00:05:14.240> on<00:05:14.390> the<00:05:14.480> amount<00:05:14.570> of<00:05:14.870> the<00:05:14.990> stuffing

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
depends on the amount of the stuffing

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:16.630 
depends on the amount of the stuffing
ship<00:05:15.560> but<00:05:15.710> then<00:05:15.830> again<00:05:15.950> we<00:05:16.160> don't<00:05:16.310> really<00:05:16.400> know

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
ship but then again we don't really know

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.150 
ship but then again we don't really know
this<00:05:16.970> is<00:05:17.180> really<00:05:17.360> helping<00:05:17.720> to<00:05:17.840> begin<00:05:18.140> with<00:05:18.350> now

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
this is really helping to begin with now

this point that I can see I mean you can

00:07:59.460 --> 00:07:59.470 
look at you know listen to witness

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:02.580 
look at you know listen to witness

testimony and reach you know while

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:04.620 
testimony and reach you know while
conclusions<00:08:03.250> but<00:08:03.460> there's<00:08:04.180> nothing<00:08:04.480> to

conclusions but there's nothing to
really<00:08:04.840> prove<00:08:05.230> it<00:08:05.440> that's<00:08:05.590> the<00:08:05.770> case<00:08:05.950> so

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:06.370 
really prove it that's the case so

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:08.910 
really prove it that's the case so
there's<00:08:06.640> no<00:08:06.730> reason<00:08:06.910> to<00:08:07.060> panic<00:08:07.120> right<00:08:07.960> now<00:08:08.200> but

there's no reason to panic right now but

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:09.840 
there's no reason to panic right now but
certainly<00:08:09.220> this<00:08:09.340> is<00:08:09.460> a<00:08:09.490> very<00:08:09.610> interesting

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:09.850 
certainly this is a very interesting

certainly this is a very interesting
subject<00:08:10.240> we<00:08:10.630> should<00:08:10.810> be<00:08:10.870> looking<00:08:10.990> into<00:08:11.290> it<00:08:11.500> a
