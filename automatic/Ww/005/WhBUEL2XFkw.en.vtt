00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.010 
anymore i'm running off of an actual
thing<00:02:19.640> this<00:02:20.640> computer<00:02:21.209> i<00:02:21.240> found<00:02:21.630> out<00:02:21.810> it

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
thing this computer i found out it

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.610 
thing this computer i found out it
actually<00:02:22.200> is<00:02:22.560> made<00:02:22.980> for<00:02:23.250> windows<00:02:23.520> vista<00:02:23.940> basic

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
actually is made for windows vista basic

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.270 
actually is made for windows vista basic
so<00:02:25.620> it<00:02:25.890> is<00:02:26.580> running<00:02:26.880> what<00:02:27.480> it's<00:02:27.600> supposed<00:02:27.870> to

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
so it is running what it's supposed to

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.530 
so it is running what it's supposed to
but<00:02:30.620> until<00:02:31.620> pentium<00:02:32.190> inside<00:02:32.550> that's<00:02:32.790> fake<00:02:33.270> I

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
but until pentium inside that's fake I

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.350 
but until pentium inside that's fake I
got<00:02:33.780> these<00:02:33.930> stickers<00:02:34.230> from<00:02:34.530> my<00:02:34.770> friends

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
got these stickers from my friends

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.960 
got these stickers from my friends
that's<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.480> basic<00:02:36.930> that's<00:02:37.320> true<00:02:37.709> the<00:02:38.580> Pentium

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
that's the basic that's true the Pentium

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.290 
that's the basic that's true the Pentium
inside<00:02:39.300> I<00:02:39.330> planned<00:02:39.840> on<00:02:40.050> if<00:02:41.010> you<00:02:41.610> guys<00:02:41.760> can<00:02:42.030> tell

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
inside I planned on if you guys can tell

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.600 
inside I planned on if you guys can tell
me<00:02:42.450> or<00:02:42.660> do<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.290> little<00:02:43.590> bit<00:02:43.739> of<00:02:43.770> research<00:02:44.130> for<00:02:44.430> me

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
me or do a little bit of research for me

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.640 
me or do a little bit of research for me
and<00:02:44.850> and<00:02:45.480> find<00:02:46.110> out<00:02:46.290> if<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.880> second<00:02:48.500> find<00:02:49.500> out

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
and and find out if the second find out

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:56.920 
and and find out if the second find out
if<00:02:49.830> this<00:02:50.670> computer<00:02:52.100> which<00:02:53.100> i<00:02:53.340> believe<00:02:53.400> is<00:02:54.920> a<00:02:55.920> DC

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
if this computer which i believe is a DC

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:03.170 
if this computer which i believe is a DC
what<00:02:57.930> is<00:02:58.050> it<00:02:58.760> there's<00:02:59.760> a<00:02:59.910> DC<00:03:00.830> 7100<00:03:01.830> it<00:03:02.150> has<00:03:03.150> a

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
what is it there's a DC 7100 it has a

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.890 
what is it there's a DC 7100 it has a

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
pentium 4 hyper-threading can it support

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.759 
pentium 4 hyper-threading can it support

um a pendant pentium dual-core because

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.470 
um a pendant pentium dual-core because
right<00:03:10.980> now<00:03:11.010> as<00:03:11.340> it<00:03:11.370> is<00:03:11.549> it<00:03:11.850> it<00:03:12.030> technically<00:03:12.390> is

right now as it is it it technically is

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.970 
right now as it is it it technically is
a<00:03:12.600> pentium<00:03:12.989> dual-core<00:03:13.170> because<00:03:13.590> it<00:03:13.680> has<00:03:13.799> two

this<00:03:19.560> computer<00:03:19.799> I<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.580> modifications<00:03:21.299> I<00:03:21.390> did

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
this computer I the modifications I did

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.930 
this computer I the modifications I did
is<00:03:22.230> there<00:03:22.560> see<00:03:22.709> Nova<00:03:22.890> CP<00:03:23.280> cooler<00:03:23.549> right<00:03:23.730> here

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
is there see Nova CP cooler right here

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.460 
is there see Nova CP cooler right here
in<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.239> actual<00:03:24.690> fan<00:03:24.930> right<00:03:25.110> they<00:03:25.290> have

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
in the actual fan right they have

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.539 
in the actual fan right they have
reversed<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:26.040> fan<00:03:27.530> so<00:03:28.530> it<00:03:28.650> blows<00:03:28.830> out<00:03:29.070> instead

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
reversed the fan so it blows out instead

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.590 
reversed the fan so it blows out instead
of<00:03:29.610> sucking<00:03:30.120> in<00:03:30.950> and<00:03:31.950> as<00:03:32.250> you<00:03:32.430> can<00:03:32.580> see<00:03:32.610> is<00:03:33.090> two

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
of sucking in and as you can see is two

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.380 
of sucking in and as you can see is two
core<00:03:33.900> cpu<00:03:36.680> i'll<00:03:37.680> go<00:03:37.860> like<00:03:37.980> that<00:03:38.250> start<00:03:39.209> task

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.640 
core cpu i'll go like that start task
manager

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:49.309 

as<00:03:43.650> you<00:03:44.129> can<00:03:44.250> see<00:03:44.580> their<00:03:44.760> cpu<00:03:45.360> usage<00:03:45.569> too<00:03:48.319> so

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
as you can see their cpu usage too so

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:54.020 
as you can see their cpu usage too so
yeah<00:03:51.409> you<00:03:52.409> guys<00:03:52.620> can<00:03:52.799> see<00:03:53.069> is<00:03:53.400> running

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
yeah you guys can see is running

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.210 
yeah you guys can see is running
actually<00:03:54.330> pretty<00:03:54.480> good<00:03:54.690> everyone<00:03:55.620> says<00:03:55.860> oh

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
actually pretty good everyone says oh

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.039 
actually pretty good everyone says oh
when<00:03:56.640> does<00:03:56.790> this<00:03:56.970> sucks<00:03:57.450> it's<00:03:57.690> not<00:03:57.750> going<00:03:57.930> to

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
when does this sucks it's not going to

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.259 
when does this sucks it's not going to
run<00:03:58.140> well<00:03:58.319> on<00:03:58.349> your<00:03:58.620> computer<00:03:58.980> bullcrap<00:03:59.910> as

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
run well on your computer bullcrap as

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.479 
run well on your computer bullcrap as
you<00:04:00.780> guys<00:04:00.930> can<00:04:01.110> see<00:04:01.170> it<00:04:01.560> is<00:04:01.650> running<00:04:02.010> actually

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
you guys can see it is running actually

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.470 
you guys can see it is running actually
decently<00:04:03.239> well<00:04:03.540> I<00:04:04.730> mean<00:04:05.730> I<00:04:05.849> can<00:04:06.030> do<00:04:06.120> everything

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
decently well I mean I can do everything

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.400 
decently well I mean I can do everything
perfectly<00:04:07.319> fine<00:04:08.690> so<00:04:09.690> put<00:04:09.870> off<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:09.989> Welcome

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
perfectly fine so put off the Welcome

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.009 
perfectly fine so put off the Welcome
Center<00:04:10.739> it<00:04:10.980> opens<00:04:11.610> up<00:04:11.730> within<00:04:11.940> four<00:04:12.510> seconds

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
Center it opens up within four seconds

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.650 
Center it opens up within four seconds
