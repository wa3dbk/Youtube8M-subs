00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
and just heat around the swing arm a

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.130 
and just heat around the swing arm a
little<00:00:44.670> bit<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.450> then<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.690> just<00:00:45.750> find<00:00:46.020> the

just<00:01:38.759> set<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:39.360> here<00:01:39.600> or<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.320> cannot<00:01:40.560> do

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
just set this in here or you cannot do

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.830 
just set this in here or you cannot do
is<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.009> cannot<00:01:41.159> hammer<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:41.759> even<00:01:42.659> if<00:01:42.750> you

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
is you cannot hammer it in even if you

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.929 
is you cannot hammer it in even if you
get<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.049> right<00:01:43.140> size<00:01:43.200> socket<00:01:43.729> it'll<00:01:44.729> bend

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
get the right size socket it'll bend

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.090 
get the right size socket it'll bend
this<00:01:45.259> in<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.380> little<00:01:46.590> bit<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.740> it'll<00:01:46.890> pinch

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
this in a little bit and it'll pinch

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.670 
this in a little bit and it'll pinch
your<00:01:47.250> bearings<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.610> they<00:01:47.700> won't<00:01:47.880> spin<00:01:48.619> so<00:01:49.619> you

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
your bearings and they won't spin so you

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.840 
your bearings and they won't spin so you
got<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.920> make<00:01:50.009> sure<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.369> press<00:01:50.549> them<00:01:50.759> in

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
got to make sure that you press them in

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.850 
got to make sure that you press them in
now<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.659> don't<00:01:51.930> need<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.110> buy<00:01:52.259> press<00:01:53.570> my<00:01:54.570> press

going to take all this stuff and we're
just<00:02:36.850> going<00:02:37.000> to<00:02:37.030> slide<00:02:37.930> it<00:02:38.050> down<00:02:38.080> into<00:02:38.350> here

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
just going to slide it down into here

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:45.320 
just going to slide it down into here
now<00:02:43.350> we're<00:02:44.350> just<00:02:44.410> going<00:02:44.590> to<00:02:44.620> start<00:02:44.830> tightening

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
now we're just going to start tightening

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.070 
now we're just going to start tightening
and<00:02:46.330> we're<00:02:46.510> going<00:02:46.630> to<00:02:46.660> make<00:02:46.750> sure<00:02:46.930> that

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
and we're going to make sure that

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.930 
and we're going to make sure that
everything's<00:02:47.470> straight<00:02:49.620> so<00:02:50.620> slowly<00:02:51.550> start

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
everything's straight so slowly start

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:58.140 
everything's straight so slowly start
tightening<00:02:56.130> it's<00:02:57.130> not<00:02:57.250> perfectly<00:02:58.030> straight

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
tightening it's not perfectly straight

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.020 
tightening it's not perfectly straight
it<00:02:58.510> will<00:02:58.600> Center<00:02:58.930> itself<00:02:59.520> but<00:03:00.520> if<00:03:00.670> it's<00:03:00.820> really

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
it will Center itself but if it's really

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.520 
it will Center itself but if it's really
crooked<00:03:01.330> then<00:03:01.480> obviously<00:03:01.630> Scott<00:03:02.170> is<00:03:02.320> cutting

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
crooked then obviously Scott is cutting

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.190 
crooked then obviously Scott is cutting
it<00:03:02.620> out<00:03:02.650> by<00:03:02.830> hand<00:03:04.140> okay<00:03:05.140> and<00:03:05.170> let's<00:03:05.470> do<00:03:05.590> this

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
it out by hand okay and let's do this

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.510 
it out by hand okay and let's do this
that's<00:03:08.200> how<00:03:08.530> you<00:03:08.590> got<00:03:08.800> that<00:03:08.920> bearing<00:03:09.190> flush

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
that's how you got that bearing flush

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.729 
that's how you got that bearing flush
with<00:03:10.450> the<00:03:10.570> end<00:03:10.690> of<00:03:10.750> the<00:03:10.810> swing<00:03:11.049> on<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:14.470> I<00:03:14.530> can

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
with the end of the swing on and I can

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.539 
with the end of the swing on and I can
see<00:03:14.950> this<00:03:15.880> takes<00:03:16.180> almost<00:03:16.360> no<00:03:16.540> effort<00:03:16.780> at<00:03:17.049> all

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
see this takes almost no effort at all

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:25.890 
see this takes almost no effort at all
goes<00:03:18.549> down<00:03:18.700> very<00:03:18.730> quickly<00:03:19.090> I<00:03:24.480> can<00:03:25.480> see<00:03:25.660> here

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
goes down very quickly I can see here

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.870 
goes down very quickly I can see here
that<00:03:26.080> it's<00:03:27.010> going<00:03:27.190> in<00:03:29.459> it's<00:03:30.459> going<00:03:30.760> in<00:03:30.850> very

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
that it's going in it's going in very

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:51.750 
that it's going in it's going in very
easily<00:03:31.299> and<00:03:31.930> it's<00:03:32.470> going<00:03:32.620> in<00:03:33.000> straight

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.070 

once<00:03:52.760> you<00:03:52.880> have<00:03:53.000> it<00:03:53.090> flush<00:03:53.360> go<00:03:53.840> ahead<00:03:53.989> and

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
once you have it flush go ahead and

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.449 
once you have it flush go ahead and
remove<00:03:54.200> the<00:03:54.819> setup<00:03:55.819> without<00:03:55.910> here<00:03:57.310> so<00:03:58.310> now<00:03:58.400> the

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
remove the setup without here so now the

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.070 
remove the setup without here so now the
bearings<00:03:58.880> in<00:03:59.000> there<00:03:59.150> and<00:03:59.330> it's<00:03:59.690> flush<00:03:59.930> with

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
bearings in there and it's flush with

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.750 
bearings in there and it's flush with
the<00:04:00.200> end<00:04:00.350> but<00:04:00.709> we<00:04:00.800> need<00:04:00.950> to<00:04:01.130> countersink<00:04:01.550> it<00:04:01.730> a

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
the end but we need to countersink it a

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.940 
the end but we need to countersink it a
little<00:04:01.940> bit<00:04:02.060> so<00:04:02.900> you<00:04:02.959> need<00:04:03.260> to<00:04:03.380> find<00:04:03.590> out<00:04:03.739> what

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
little bit so you need to find out what

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.170 
little bit so you need to find out what
the<00:04:04.100> measurement<00:04:04.489> is<00:04:04.610> that<00:04:04.790> it's<00:04:04.910> supposed<00:04:05.000> to

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
the measurement is that it's supposed to

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.479 
the measurement is that it's supposed to
be<00:04:05.239> counter<00:04:05.569> suckin<00:04:05.780> and<00:04:06.200> here's<00:04:07.040> what<00:04:07.190> I<00:04:07.220> have

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:21.969 
the end of the phone now
we<00:04:20.660> need<00:04:20.780> to<00:04:20.870> make<00:04:20.989> sure<00:04:21.019> this<00:04:21.410> is<00:04:21.620> centered

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
we need to make sure this is centered

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.940 
we need to make sure this is centered
otherwise<00:04:22.520> it<00:04:22.729> can<00:04:23.290> possibly<00:04:24.290> damage<00:04:24.830> the

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
otherwise it can possibly damage the

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.070 
otherwise it can possibly damage the
bearings<00:04:25.310> so<00:04:25.639> now<00:04:26.600> we're<00:04:26.720> going<00:04:26.810> to<00:04:26.870> start

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
bearings so now we're going to start

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:34.270 
bearings so now we're going to start
tightening<00:04:27.290> this<00:04:27.560> down<00:04:27.620> as<00:04:27.919> well<00:04:33.160> all<00:04:34.160> right

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280

tightening this down as well all right
so<00:04:34.430> now<00:04:34.550> we're<00:04:34.669> getting<00:04:34.729> close<00:04:35.060> to<00:04:35.270> that<00:04:35.540> piece

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
so now we're getting close to that piece

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.340 
so now we're getting close to that piece
of<00:04:35.840> tape<00:04:36.169> we<00:04:36.800> will<00:04:37.210> go<00:04:38.210> and<00:04:38.389> top<00:04:38.570> lines<00:04:39.020> up

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
of tape we will go and top lines up

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.730 
of tape we will go and top lines up
there<00:04:40.570> now<00:04:41.570> you<00:04:41.630> go<00:04:41.780> ahead<00:04:41.870> and<00:04:42.110> buy<00:04:42.260> back<00:04:42.590> it

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
there now you go ahead and buy back it

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.950 
there now you go ahead and buy back it
all<00:04:42.830> off<00:04:45.100> there<00:04:46.100> you<00:04:46.190> can<00:04:46.340> see<00:04:46.460> the<00:04:46.550> bearing

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
all off there you can see the bearing

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.960 
all off there you can see the bearing
installed<00:04:47.960> centered<00:04:48.740> in<00:04:48.830> the<00:04:48.919> swing<00:04:49.100> arm<00:04:49.220> the

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
installed centered in the swing arm the

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.930 
installed centered in the swing arm the
next<00:04:50.150> step<00:04:50.419> is<00:04:50.600> the<00:04:50.780> seal<00:04:51.380> goes<00:04:51.650> on<00:04:52.520> the<00:04:52.640> inside

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
next step is the seal goes on the inside

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.029 
next step is the seal goes on the inside
of<00:04:52.970> the<00:04:53.120> swing<00:04:53.330> arm<00:04:53.419> on<00:04:53.600> the<00:04:53.690> other<00:04:53.810> side<00:04:54.050> so

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 
of the swing arm on the other side so

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:57.630 
of the swing arm on the other side so
what<00:04:55.130> you<00:04:55.190> want<00:04:55.340> to<00:04:55.400> do<00:04:55.490> with<00:04:56.300> the<00:04:56.419> seal<00:04:56.780> is

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640 
what you want to do with the seal is

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.540 
what you want to do with the seal is
just<00:04:58.640> a<00:04:59.530> bit<00:05:00.530> of<00:05:00.620> grease<00:05:00.770> on<00:05:00.950> the<00:05:01.039> outside<00:05:01.370> of

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
just a bit of grease on the outside of

contaminate it you know don't wash it in
your<00:06:37.210> bearings<00:06:37.510> so<00:06:38.070> then<00:06:39.070> go<00:06:39.520> ahead<00:06:39.730> and<00:06:41.940> slide
