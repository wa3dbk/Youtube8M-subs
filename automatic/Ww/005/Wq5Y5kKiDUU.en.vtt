00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
to kill so gracefully and while

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.080 
to kill so gracefully and while
literally<00:02:11.780> he<00:02:12.050> could<00:02:12.290> literally<00:02:13.040> take<00:02:13.489> on

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
literally he could literally take on

literally he could literally take on
almost<00:02:14.569> all<00:02:14.780> of<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.319> Autobots<00:02:15.790> no<00:02:16.790> I'm<00:02:16.880> just

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
almost all of the Autobots no I'm just

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.510 
almost all of the Autobots no I'm just
saying<00:02:17.270> you<00:02:17.660> know<00:02:17.810> it<00:02:18.170> was<00:02:18.349> just<00:02:18.380> amazing<00:02:18.800> fall

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
saying you know it was just amazing fall

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.280 
saying you know it was just amazing fall
of<00:02:19.640> Cybertron<00:02:20.180> actually<00:02:20.599> took<00:02:20.750> place<00:02:20.810> during

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
of Cybertron actually took place during

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.600 
of Cybertron actually took place during
the<00:02:21.739> end<00:02:21.950> of<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:23.380> life<00:02:24.380> cycle<00:02:24.410> of<00:02:24.830> Cybertron

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
the end of the life cycle of Cybertron

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.339 
the end of the life cycle of Cybertron
to<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:26.090> point<00:02:26.330> where<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:26.630> war<00:02:26.870> literally

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
to the point where the war literally

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.589 
to the point where the war literally
ravaged<00:02:27.770> it<00:02:27.890> so<00:02:28.069> much<00:02:28.370> it<00:02:28.640> became<00:02:28.940> a<00:02:29.120> lifeless

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
ravaged it so much it became a lifeless

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.600 
ravaged it so much it became a lifeless
husk<00:02:29.870> and<00:02:30.140> they<00:02:30.560> had<00:02:30.739> to<00:02:30.860> go<00:02:30.980> ahead<00:02:31.040> and<00:02:31.250> escape

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
husk and they had to go ahead and escape

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.309 
husk and they had to go ahead and escape
it<00:02:31.819> now<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.239> new<00:02:32.510> one<00:02:32.750> is<00:02:32.900> supposed<00:02:33.020> to<00:02:33.230> be

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
it now the new one is supposed to be

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.039 
it now the new one is supposed to be
called<00:02:33.560> rise<00:02:33.860> of<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.280> dark<00:02:34.580> spark<00:02:34.939> which<00:02:35.239> does

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
called rise of the dark spark which does

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:37.959 
called rise of the dark spark which does
make<00:02:36.079> sense<00:02:36.560> now<00:02:36.829> on<00:02:37.430> for<00:02:37.640> those<00:02:37.730> who<00:02:37.879> don't

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:37.969 
make sense now on for those who don't

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:40.120 
make sense now on for those who don't
know<00:02:38.090> dark<00:02:38.480> spark<00:02:38.810> usually<00:02:39.409> consists

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
know dark spark usually consists

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.720 
know dark spark usually consists
of<00:02:41.050> talking<00:02:42.050> about<00:02:42.140> Unicron<00:02:42.890> that's<00:02:43.340> usually

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
of talking about Unicron that's usually

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.180 
of talking about Unicron that's usually
where<00:02:44.330> Unicron<00:02:44.870> tark<00:02:45.260> comes<00:02:45.800> into<00:02:45.980> play<00:02:46.160> there

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
where Unicron tark comes into play there

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.220 
where Unicron tark comes into play there
so<00:02:46.880> this<00:02:47.090> could<00:02:47.240> be<00:02:47.300> a<00:02:47.390> chance<00:02:47.660> that<00:02:47.780> we<00:02:48.080> are

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
so this could be a chance that we are

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.990 
so this could be a chance that we are
not<00:02:48.410> just<00:02:48.470> fighting<00:02:48.890> Megatron<00:02:49.730> in<00:02:49.880> this

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
not just fighting Megatron in this

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.970 
not just fighting Megatron in this
particular<00:02:50.150> one<00:02:50.540> but<00:02:50.690> Unicron<00:02:51.140> as<00:02:51.260> well<00:02:51.530> for

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
particular one but Unicron as well for

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.100 
particular one but Unicron as well for
those<00:02:52.070> no<00:02:52.310> no<00:02:52.490> Unicron<00:02:53.060> is<00:02:53.240> literally<00:02:53.870> the

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
those no no Unicron is literally the

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.610 
those no no Unicron is literally the
quintessential<00:02:54.890> Satan<00:02:55.820> of<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.660> Cybertronian

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
quintessential Satan of the Cybertronian

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.820 
quintessential Satan of the Cybertronian

arm life whatever and so um it's

actually going to be I'm not looking

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:06.880 
actually going to be I'm not looking
forward<00:03:05.750> to<00:03:05.870> this<00:03:05.960> I<00:03:06.080> really<00:03:06.230> am<00:03:06.470> now<00:03:06.620> the

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
forward to this I really am now the

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.010 
forward to this I really am now the
thing<00:03:07.250> about<00:03:07.280> this<00:03:07.610> is<00:03:07.670> that<00:03:07.850> one<00:03:08.510> we<00:03:08.750> don't

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
thing about this is that one we don't

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.590 
thing about this is that one we don't
know<00:03:09.140> who's<00:03:09.290> developing<00:03:09.770> it<00:03:10.360> there's<00:03:11.360> a<00:03:11.450> good

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
know who's developing it there's a good

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.540 
know who's developing it there's a good
chance<00:03:11.810> that<00:03:12.020> activation<00:03:12.500> will<00:03:12.830> publish<00:03:13.340> it

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
chance that activation will publish it

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.850 
chance that activation will publish it
but<00:03:13.970> we<00:03:14.120> don't<00:03:14.420> know<00:03:14.690> who<00:03:15.110> is<00:03:15.170> developing<00:03:15.500> it

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
but we don't know who is developing it

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.220 
but we don't know who is developing it
no<00:03:16.010> one<00:03:16.550> want<00:03:16.910> to<00:03:17.000> say<00:03:17.210> well<00:03:17.450> we<00:03:17.630> already<00:03:17.840> know

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
no one want to say well we already know

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.580 
no one want to say well we already know
that<00:03:18.500> the<00:03:19.010> developers<00:03:19.550> of<00:03:19.840> fall<00:03:20.840> of<00:03:20.990> Cybertron

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
that the developers of fall of Cybertron

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.560 
that the developers of fall of Cybertron
could<00:03:22.160> be<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.400> ones<00:03:22.580> behind<00:03:22.760> it<00:03:23.120> which<00:03:23.270> it

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
could be the ones behind it which it

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.570 
could be the ones behind it which it
definitely<00:03:23.720> is<00:03:24.050> true<00:03:24.350> but<00:03:24.950> that<00:03:25.250> being<00:03:25.460> said

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
definitely is true but that being said

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.070 
definitely is true but that being said
though<00:03:26.000> there<00:03:26.300> is<00:03:26.420> no<00:03:26.570> proof<00:03:26.810> that<00:03:26.960> they're

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
though there is no proof that they're

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.920 
though there is no proof that they're
behind<00:03:27.380> it<00:03:27.620> so<00:03:27.860> there's<00:03:28.340> that<00:03:28.700> it<00:03:29.510> could<00:03:29.750> also

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
behind it so there's that it could also

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.780 
behind it so there's that it could also
be<00:03:30.080> mercenary<00:03:30.740> technologies<00:03:31.370> who<00:03:31.550> actually

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
be mercenary technologies who actually

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.840 
be mercenary technologies who actually
did<00:03:32.180> the<00:03:32.240> pc<00:03:32.810> version<00:03:32.840> but<00:03:33.410> once<00:03:34.100> again<00:03:34.250> we

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
did the pc version but once again we

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.070

realized there's a new of dlc that came

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.590 
realized there's a new of dlc that came
out<00:03:44.780> from<00:03:45.550> for<00:03:46.550> transformers<00:03:47.360> fall<00:03:47.510> of

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
out from for transformers fall of

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.510 
out from for transformers fall of
Cybertron<00:03:48.020> I<00:03:48.140> didn't<00:03:48.380> even<00:03:48.470> know<00:03:48.770> but<00:03:49.310> anyway

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
Cybertron I didn't even know but anyway

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.040 
Cybertron I didn't even know but anyway
go<00:03:49.760> back<00:03:50.000> to<00:03:50.150> without<00:03:50.300> some<00:03:50.600> up<00:03:50.720> before

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
go back to without some up before

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.660 
go back to without some up before
there's<00:03:51.500> a<00:03:51.560> good<00:03:51.680> chance<00:03:51.920> that<00:03:52.190> on<00:03:52.310> it<00:03:52.490> could

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
there's a good chance that on it could

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.220 
there's a good chance that on it could
be<00:03:52.760> made<00:03:52.880> by<00:03:53.030> one<00:03:53.180> of<00:03:53.210> those<00:03:53.330> guys<00:03:53.480> but<00:03:53.840> most

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
be made by one of those guys but most

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.440 
be made by one of those guys but most
likely<00:03:54.380> not<00:03:54.590> now<00:03:55.160> we<00:03:55.220> also<00:03:55.490> know<00:03:55.910> that<00:03:55.940> um

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
likely not now we also know that um

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.420 
likely not now we also know that um
transformers<00:03:57.350> universe<00:03:57.380> is<00:03:57.950> actually<00:03:58.250> coming

before I still am actually um and I

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.480 
before I still am actually um and I
don't<00:04:06.230> think<00:04:06.380> this<00:04:06.530> is<00:04:06.590> a<00:04:06.860> so<00:04:06.920> I<00:04:07.100> think<00:04:07.190> it

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
don't think this is a so I think it

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.390 
don't think this is a so I think it
could<00:04:08.090> be<00:04:08.330> that<00:04:08.680> but<00:04:09.680> I<00:04:09.709> don't<00:04:10.010> really<00:04:10.280> think

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
could be that but I don't really think

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.340 
could be that but I don't really think
that<00:04:10.820> that's<00:04:11.000> what<00:04:11.480> is<00:04:11.600> I<00:04:11.720> think<00:04:11.780> Transformers

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
that that's what is I think Transformers

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.949 
that that's what is I think Transformers
Universe<00:04:12.470> and<00:04:12.950> transformers<00:04:13.790> though<00:04:14.390> the

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
Universe and transformers though the

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.630 
Universe and transformers though the
rise<00:04:15.140> of<00:04:15.380> dark<00:04:15.590> spark<00:04:15.860> is<00:04:16.040> in<00:04:16.190> fact<00:04:16.370> two

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
rise of dark spark is in fact two

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.210 
rise of dark spark is in fact two
different<00:04:17.060> things<00:04:17.239> so<00:04:17.900> being<00:04:18.530> a<00:04:18.680> big<00:04:18.920> fan<00:04:19.190> of
