in this tutorial you're going to learn
how<00:00:05.790> to<00:00:05.819> draw<00:00:06.120> a<00:00:06.359> very<00:00:06.690> easy<00:00:07.049> star<00:00:07.790> begin<00:00:08.790> by

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
how to draw a very easy star begin by

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.350 
how to draw a very easy star begin by
drawing<00:00:09.240> one<00:00:09.870> vertical<00:00:10.410> line<00:00:11.120> next<00:00:12.120> you're

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
drawing one vertical line next you're

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.879 
drawing one vertical line next you're
going<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:12.540> draw<00:00:12.780> in<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.019> sides<00:00:13.440> of<00:00:13.740> the

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
going to draw in the sides of the

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.039 
going to draw in the sides of the
triangle<00:00:14.519> now<00:00:15.059> I'm<00:00:15.330> drawing<00:00:15.599> this<00:00:15.750> freehand

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
triangle now I'm drawing this freehand

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.260 
triangle now I'm drawing this freehand
feel<00:00:16.590> free<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:16.890> use<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.369> ruler<00:00:17.730> if<00:00:17.970> you're<00:00:18.119> more

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
feel free to use a ruler if you're more

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.340 
feel free to use a ruler if you're more
comfortable<00:00:18.300> with<00:00:18.810> that

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
comfortable with that

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.740 
comfortable with that
I'm<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.369> balling<00:00:20.850> these<00:00:21.000> things<00:00:21.240> but<00:00:21.480> you<00:00:21.570> do

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
I'm a balling these things but you do

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.290 
I'm a balling these things but you do
want<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:21.990> make<00:00:22.140> sure<00:00:22.199> that<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.279> each<00:00:23.609> corner

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
want to make sure that the each corner

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.960 
want to make sure that the each corner
on<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.779> bottom<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.140> your<00:00:25.170> triangle<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:26.730> an

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
on the bottom of your triangle is an

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.509 
on the bottom of your triangle is an
equal<00:00:27.269> distance<00:00:27.630> from<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.109> line<00:00:29.070> on<00:00:29.369> each

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
equal distance from the line on each

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.319 
equal distance from the line on each
side<00:00:29.900> so<00:00:30.900> once<00:00:31.320> you've<00:00:31.560> done<00:00:32.000> you<00:00:33.000> finish

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
side so once you've done you finish

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.760 
side so once you've done you finish
drawing<00:00:33.540> that<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.140> can<00:00:34.290> erase<00:00:34.530> that

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
drawing that and you can erase that

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:35.959 
drawing that and you can erase that
middle<00:00:35.010> line<00:00:35.160> that's<00:00:35.460> just<00:00:35.640> there<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.910> make

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
middle line that's just there to make

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.080 
middle line that's just there to make
sure<00:00:36.090> your<00:00:36.480> triangle<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.079> symmetrical<00:00:38.090> next

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
sure your triangle is symmetrical next

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.670 
sure your triangle is symmetrical next
you're<00:00:39.360> going<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.719> draw<00:00:39.930> in<00:00:40.110> line<00:00:40.290> straight

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
you're going to draw in line straight

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.490 
you're going to draw in line straight
through<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.010> middle<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.489> one<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.480> your<00:00:42.719> bottom

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
through the middle of one of your bottom

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.310 
through the middle of one of your bottom
corners<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.160> your<00:00:44.250> triangle<00:00:45.079> you're<00:00:46.079> going<00:00:46.230> to

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
corners of your triangle you're going to

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.830 
corners of your triangle you're going to
draw<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.590> all<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.890> way<00:00:46.980> past<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.670> line<00:00:47.910> there

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
draw it all the way past the line there

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.150 
draw it all the way past the line there
on<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.230> outside<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.710> triangle<00:00:49.950> and

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
on the outside of the triangle and

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.979 
on the outside of the triangle and
you're<00:00:50.250> going<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.430> do<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.700> same<00:00:50.910> thing<00:00:51.210> on<00:00:51.449> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
you're going to do the same thing on the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.709 
you're going to do the same thing on the
other<00:00:52.020> side<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:53.420> then<00:00:54.420> you're<00:00:54.570> going<00:00:54.660> to

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
other side and then you're going to

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.650 
other side and then you're going to
connect<00:00:55.050> those<00:00:55.199> two<00:00:55.469> lines<00:00:55.739> with<00:00:56.640> one<00:00:57.059> single

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
connect those two lines with one single

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.470 
connect those two lines with one single
horizontal<00:00:58.170> line<00:00:58.739> connecting<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.820> two<00:01:00.030> ends

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
horizontal line connecting the two ends

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.900 
horizontal line connecting the two ends
and<00:01:00.660> there<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.440> can<00:01:01.559> already<00:01:01.770> see<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.280> have<00:01:02.579> a

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
and there you can already see you have a

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.219 
and there you can already see you have a
star<00:01:04.729> now<00:01:05.729> here<00:01:06.000> because<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.420> free-handed<00:01:07.110> it

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
star now here because I free-handed it

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.130 
star now here because I free-handed it
it's<00:01:07.470> not<00:01:07.770> perfectly<00:01:08.490> even<00:01:08.760> on<00:01:09.180> all<00:01:09.390> five

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
it's not perfectly even on all five

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.560 
it's not perfectly even on all five
points<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:10.860> I'm<00:01:11.040> just<00:01:11.189> going<00:01:11.369> in<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.850> as<00:01:12.060> I

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
points so I'm just going in and as I

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.789 
points so I'm just going in and as I
said<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.960> like<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.200> eyeball<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:15.560> and<00:01:16.560> that's

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
said I like to eyeball it and that's

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.130 
said I like to eyeball it and that's
just<00:01:16.860> my<00:01:17.340> personal<00:01:18.030> comfort<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.869> know<00:01:18.990> I've

just my personal comfort you know I've
never<00:01:19.650> really<00:01:19.979> enjoyed<00:01:20.009> drawing<00:01:20.610> with<00:01:20.970> a

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
never really enjoyed drawing with a

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.440 
never really enjoyed drawing with a
ruler<00:01:21.920> but<00:01:22.920> if<00:01:23.009> you're<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.220> stickler<00:01:23.700> for<00:01:23.759> for

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
so I'm done now getting all the lines

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.859 
so I'm done now getting all the lines
right<00:01:30.030> where<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.210> want<00:01:30.390> them<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:30.630> I'm<00:01:30.750> just

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:34.289 
my sharpie marker and I'm just going

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:37.580 
my sharpie marker and I'm just going
from<00:01:34.500> one<00:01:34.590> point<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.369> next<00:01:35.579> point<00:01:36.590> pulling

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
from one point to the next point pulling

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.330 
from one point to the next point pulling
it<00:01:37.710> across<00:01:41.899> and<00:01:42.899> I'm<00:01:43.380> not<00:01:43.590> even<00:01:43.860> being<00:01:44.159> that
