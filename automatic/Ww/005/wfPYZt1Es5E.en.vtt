kind<00:03:41.840> of<00:03:41.930> natural<00:03:43.090> texture<00:03:44.090> I<00:03:44.510> think<00:03:44.810> what<00:03:45.440> is

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
kind of natural texture I think what is

kind of natural texture I think what is
it<00:03:46.720> NYC<00:03:47.720> I<00:03:48.079> think<00:03:48.560> it's<00:03:48.680> their<00:03:48.859> name<00:03:49.069> they<00:03:49.370> have

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
it NYC I think it's their name they have

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.390 
it NYC I think it's their name they have
a<00:03:49.549> pretty<00:03:49.880> good<00:03:49.970> I<00:03:50.959> think<00:03:51.859> it's<00:03:51.980> like<00:03:52.099> a<00:03:52.130> light

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
a pretty good I think it's like a light

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.970 
a pretty good I think it's like a light
perm<00:03:52.669> and<00:03:52.700> then<00:03:53.150> and<00:03:53.480> then<00:03:53.690> a<00:03:53.810> perm<00:03:54.079> that<00:03:54.859> I've

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
perm and then and then a perm that I've

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.250 
perm and then and then a perm that I've
been<00:03:55.160> kind<00:03:55.400> of<00:03:55.489> I<00:03:55.609> in<00:03:55.879> and<00:03:56.209> I<00:03:56.870> think<00:03:57.109> that<00:03:57.230> that

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
been kind of I in and I think that that

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.110 
been kind of I in and I think that that
will<00:03:57.530> match<00:03:57.769> my<00:03:57.799> hair<00:03:58.160> texture<00:03:58.579> really<00:03:58.760> well

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
will match my hair texture really well

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.890 
will match my hair texture really well
so<00:03:59.599> if<00:03:59.959> you<00:04:00.139> guys<00:04:00.290> know<00:04:00.530> of<00:04:00.709> any<00:04:00.950> good<00:04:01.900> hair
