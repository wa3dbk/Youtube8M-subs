your<00:00:00.570> skin<00:00:01.020> is<00:00:01.909> the<00:00:02.909> last<00:00:03.210> frontier<00:00:03.959> of<00:00:03.990> health

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
your skin is the last frontier of health

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.550 
your skin is the last frontier of health
in<00:00:04.799> my<00:00:05.190> opinion<00:00:05.670> it's<00:00:06.569> one<00:00:06.779> of<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:07.020> largest

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
in my opinion it's one of the largest

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.560 
in my opinion it's one of the largest
organs<00:00:08.130> in<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.400> body<00:00:08.429> and<00:00:08.970> it's<00:00:09.240> certainly

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
organs in the body and it's certainly

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.690 
organs in the body and it's certainly
the<00:00:09.690> largest<00:00:09.990> as<00:00:10.530> far<00:00:10.800> as<00:00:10.980> being<00:00:11.250> one<00:00:11.519> of<00:00:11.610> the

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
the largest as far as being one of the

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.509 
the largest as far as being one of the
organs<00:00:12.450> for<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.840> excretion<00:00:13.290> of<00:00:13.590> waste<00:00:13.650> along

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
organs for the excretion of waste along

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.660 
organs for the excretion of waste along
with<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.880> kidneys<00:00:15.389> lungs<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:16.170> colon<00:00:16.619> so<00:00:17.460> that

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
with the kidneys lungs and colon so that

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.939 
with the kidneys lungs and colon so that
means<00:00:18.029> that<00:00:18.330> your<00:00:18.539> skin<00:00:18.990> is<00:00:19.020> going<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.619> reflect

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
means that your skin is going to reflect

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.890

what you're eating and what you're not
eating<00:00:22.350> it's<00:00:23.160> also<00:00:23.460> reflecting<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.510> amount

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
eating it's also reflecting the amount

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.189 
eating it's also reflecting the amount
of<00:00:24.810> waste<00:00:25.109> you're<00:00:25.619> retaining<00:00:26.189> in<00:00:26.310> your<00:00:26.460> body

it helps the skin to retain the water

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.310 
it helps the skin to retain the water
better<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:30.329> improves<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.049> circulation

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
better and it improves the circulation

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.399 
better and it improves the circulation
to<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.100> skin<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:32.670> your<00:01:32.820> skin<00:01:33.060> glows<00:01:33.420> more<00:01:33.750> it

to the skin so your skin glows more it
also<00:01:34.729> increases<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.939> density<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.960> skin

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
also increases the density of the skin

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.069 
also increases the density of the skin
that<00:01:37.470> means<00:01:38.070> your<00:01:38.310> pore<00:01:38.610> sizes<00:01:38.939> look<00:01:39.810> much

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
that means your pore sizes look much

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.679 
that means your pore sizes look much
smaller<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.860> outside<00:01:41.310> world<00:01:41.549> all<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:42.540> this

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
smaller to the outside world all of this

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.069 
smaller to the outside world all of this
means<00:01:43.020> more<00:01:43.500> beautiful<00:01:44.100> glowing<00:01:44.340> skin<00:01:44.490> all<00:01:45.149> of

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
means more beautiful glowing skin all of

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.960 
means more beautiful glowing skin all of
this<00:01:46.229> makes<00:01:46.560> us<00:01:46.770> look<00:01:46.829> younger<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.579> who

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
this makes us look younger and who
