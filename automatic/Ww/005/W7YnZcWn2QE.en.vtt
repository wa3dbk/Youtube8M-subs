00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:15.189 
so we can move on but just in tipping

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:21.300 
so we can move on but just in tipping
point<00:02:19.079> any<00:02:20.079> specifications<00:02:20.920> that<00:02:21.010> don't

this particular template had this area
custom<00:04:03.579> built<00:04:03.819> in<00:04:04.000> so<00:04:04.949> that's<00:04:05.949> not<00:04:06.159> something

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
custom built in so that's not something

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.830
