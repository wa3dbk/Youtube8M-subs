00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.060
 of a kitchen and moves them to the street 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.450

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.300
 hot spicy 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.400
 in the descent the Mexican is an idea of 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.410
 a trip when I lived in Mexico that 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.210

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:42.459
 background that special we have 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.459

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.870
 what price has 295 we are 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.010
 aware that we are on the street and the 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.500
 that you have to make people come 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.120
 and not being a site is not I do not like to be 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.970
 something that can come here there are people who 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.290

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.500
 us that is a homemade Bolognese here 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.810
 we have our homemade caldito 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.820
 here we have a racket that we are 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.170
 we have also made natural not what 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.720
 we try to make them natural products 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.030
 but made for this type of products 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.620
 No haute cuisine are not counted but many 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.810
 times of the great cooks in many 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.150
 times we have fire dishes because the 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.160
 here they are smaller than inside 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.140
 everything is not so much joy that here 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.500
 the same joys remain in another 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.550
 site and penalties also what the 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.470
 Unlike here sometimes you do not have 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.660
 what to take and work to get 17 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.670
 salaries have a lot of money is fine 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.410
 but it is also more important not to see 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.410
 and it has been my speaker I am Basque 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:23.420
 we do not have children then lets you that 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.800
 and if it is accurate, this demands my wife is 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.700
 hospitality 99 percent of the 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:31.090
 one-level chefs and women who have 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:34.090

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.860
 years 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.760
 it's as if we would have been the same 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.760
 we touch and put them on 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.569
 the relationship with the street is always 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.719
 patent our lives 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:01.909
