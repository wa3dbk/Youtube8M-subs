00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:04.679
 sweet and mint min 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:13.849
 hello programs and we are in minecraft 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.550
 as you can see but I'm in good as 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:18.380
 you see in the title is the real dan you can 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.560
 make a server slam better than 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:25.340
 come you know that minecraft is a 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:28.400
 element an option to create server 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.869
 slam pos with this mode adds commands and 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.059
 Add enough things to play with 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.010
 your friends really easy the 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.710
 truth we give here we configure and as 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.740
 you see these are the commands that you 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.530
 they can put already come standard 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.600
 you can say for example this that only 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:50.270
 be the opep for example this same 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:52.750
 this one is not no neither does it like that anymore 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.330
 or less are we going to put all 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:59.230
 we accept how we see a server a 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.230
 world any 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.530
 tatary torito 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:13.060
 the snow is something more ajeros or yes 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.950
 the ship really are not two things that 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.570
 I can not stand as you see is a normal world 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.880
 it's just created now 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.650
 and now here we give open the land and 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:26.170
 this is 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:30.380
 I'm not seeing this, I'm not going to give 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.840
 but well here you can see how you see 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.700
 it comes out differently it does not come out as always 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:39.290
 then you can choose the world of 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.580
 I play as you like but like that 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.940
 you do not want it to be all the shoppers 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.940
 basically here the idea of the island 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.590
 the ip and that is already quite simple 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.530
 the ip 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:58.280
 if you give to your friends it has left 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:01.369
 down in the chat and that's simple 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:05.560
 ok guys here I am in more or less the 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.560
 Bank menu no towels 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.950
 in the bank menu as you can see 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.890
 choose many options 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.440
 so I can create a bank for this 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.120
 to get money 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.489
 let's understand 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.110
 yes I believe this server because it's coming 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:30.739
 with a plugin that is supposed to be 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.690
 money and basically the bank does 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.690
 feel different things then we can 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.060
 look more over here 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.610
 options 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.970
 commands for example we can sell 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.200
 we can not because I do not have spawn 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:49.730
 goal bar 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:52.880
 gold and now I suppose you can not 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.530
 kill and I hurt myself 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.720
 How nice it is how it would be like 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.700
 creative but without hurting me in theory 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.840
 I think it 's that command that you made 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.430
 the best I'm wrong and I'm going to 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:06.980
 hit then not because I do not know why 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.200
 so I do not know what the wat is for 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.760
 well the one neither the commands the 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.460
 You can investigate the world you who 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.050
 neither and it's quite simple the truth 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.730
 I liked it because they already come with 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.380
 commands and you can have fun with friends 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.010
 pretty magical on a normal server 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:24.490
 apart from letting us get off the 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:28.160
 minecraft server file from minecraft 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.980
 to make a server you need to download 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.420
 the minecraft server file on your page 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.190
 and create a folder to change the 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.800
 options and all that because with this no 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.270
 they need nothing this they get in and that's it and 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.470
 I hope you liked it and see you 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.470
 in the next until next time
