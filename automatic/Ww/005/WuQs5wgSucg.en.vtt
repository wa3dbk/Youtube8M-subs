00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:05.190
 on Halloween weekend was the big e 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.960
 wolf alpha and some happy and me 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.639
 We also had a key and what I have there 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.420
 everything is so experienced on the servers 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.420
 you see in the video now 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.680
 the wolff on halloween weekend gave it 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.210
 finally the big alpha in the us and 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.650
 many happy al fakih winners in 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.240
 the various roles of the hunter and 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.720
 also slip into the skin of the monster 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.550
 were allowed 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.079
 the basic principle of the consequence should be 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.880
 meanwhile, everybody should be familiar with it 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:33.800
 four hunter controlled by four players 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.690
 fight in a arena full of neutral 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.309
 Pug against a fifth player of the one 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:42.020
 big strong monster controls which 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:43.640
 Slowly the team of the 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.470
 hunter consists of four classes which 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.300
 each with their own characters 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.670
 possess own abilities and weapons 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.300
 the game can be roughly divided into two phases 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.950
 subdivide 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.210
 In the beginning, the monster will be there as long as it is 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.460
 still weak and defenseless is wanted 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.600
 caught and fought in the endgame then 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.329
 have to hand because your base 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.410
 First we throw one 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.739
 look at the handtor team 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.420
 We continue to bring is class 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.070
 the assault is the damage dealer in the 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.840
 team he owns two weapons with those 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.079
 Aligning extreme fischer anna monster 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.880
 can 

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:12.350
 with the lightning then he can out 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.210
 close up lightning on the monster 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.100
 or shoot other enemies nearby 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.050
 and thus constantly align damage 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.550
 his doubt is thanks to the low 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.630
 Residue well around goals in further 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.850
 distance to meet 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.140
 come to that yet explosive them 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.060
 can place on the map 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.770
 These activate after a short time 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.540
 by itself and explode once 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.560
 opponent over it runs as last 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.270
 he still has one 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.600
 activate temporary shield 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.880
 can 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.440
 as soon as he gets into danger when he gets the 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.790
 you should play salt in the team case 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.530
 Make sure that you are always close 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.610
 from mendig and support stays there 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.590
 you get alive 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.060
 a monster will often try first 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.650
 a poorly positioned the wood 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.270
 to kill for the most part of 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.900
 harm that the team can do too 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.340
 prevent 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.049
 if this is good of the 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.180
 defensive classes has been protected 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.610
 the monster does not stand a chance that brings us 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.260
 then to the next class the medic the 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.810
 medic character first in the 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.760
 hiesfeld was allowed to play her big games 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.619
 task is to cure the goal though 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.299
 it just plugged in and 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.340
 also the monster from the clean up 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.780
 should be able to with the complain she often 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.800
 some distance the life of her 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.300
 heal player 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.920
 she also owns a heli world 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.660
 with whom they allied themselves and all 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.440
 close to a part of life 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.090
 can play 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.440
 when the team can track the monster 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.210
 The man with his stun weapon 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.650
 the monster sloane and it for one 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.690
 short period even through walls 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.190
 make visible in the fight itself can the 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.460
 manic when he is not sharing himself 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.260
 got to 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.060
 with your sniper rifle holes in the 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.470
 shoot monster of the monster if that 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.210
 Meet team members provide this 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.160
 they cause more harm than usual 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.750
 The medic should be careful that he 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.160
 in the team if the right eye for 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.990
 he should own his team members 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.340
 inconspicuous in the background to stay around 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.640
 prevent the monster in the early 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.810
 turns off the support character hangs 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.280
 deals with the damage 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.230
 shield his team 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.880
 He should always be in combination with the 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.260
 magic focus on the person 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.390
 those of monster in the lack taken 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.590
 is protected with its switches can 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.360
 the team members in which he has one 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.490
 much of the damage done to them 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.080
 should take with him prevented 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.520
 laser katar can close the supportzone 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.240
 to him are meeting for the damage 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.070
 to feel 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.480
 the monster should be just caught 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.190
 and can not move from the spot 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.270
 the support is in the position a rather 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.860
 strike request 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.750
 the several on a small area 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.239
 Bomb damage extremely bad 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.040
 can cause 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.810
 as a fourth support has the ability 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.850
 to make oneself and others invisible 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.620
 This is especially useful overturned 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.910
 to help teams up or before 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.160
 monster to flee if you are the last 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.810
 living team member is the support 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.520
 should be similar to the medic in the 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.230
 Team felt restrained and on the salt 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.480
 &amp; pepper do not pay attention to this 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.340
 he has to fall early in the right moment 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.530
 his first work was the monster 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.640
 deduct massive life when the fight 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.020
 he should tip over quickly 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.459
 make invisible around members again 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.330
 high to help or at the right moment 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.860
 run away 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.870
 the last class in the team of the hand there 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.400
 is the hit in the alpha we were allowed 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.170
 First, try the maggie directly 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.570
 a fifth team joins the group of 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.250
 hand brings your dog is daisy 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.140
 extremely useful, even if you do that directly 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.670
 Not at all noticed if that 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.140
 Monster can not refrain from football 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.190
 the isi take the track and that 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.910
 team back in the right direction 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.440
 use 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.850
 likewise the dog can fallen 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.750
 revive handball if the monster 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.970
 and be careful 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.310
 with the mobile arena of the body can 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.080
 team if in gate 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.819
 once the monster has been found 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.530
 they are set up and they will 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.209
 as long as the stairs live on is some 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.069
 to hold blood as a monster 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.079
 the premiere weapon of the offender is a 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.090
 machine gun with which he is in close combat 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.410
 his opponent can attack and that 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.300
 last body of the body are the 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.770
 Harpoon cable with which he is the monster 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.300
 can hold on while the hunter is doing that 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.919
 Monster should always seek the hit 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.490
 busy harpoon cable on the map 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.139
 to distribute 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.610
 once you are in reach the 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.169
 Mobile arena to be activated 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.669
 while the good case i recommend 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:35.200
 too many fall as possible 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:36.580
 to place on the floor around the 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.330
 move the monster as best it can 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.940
 limit 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.810
 So now the monster class that is one 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.669
 art for yourself 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.139
 to know that you are not team members 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:45.820
 has the back one strengthens 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:47.500
 you from the beginning to every round 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.060
 Stressed by the jungle rushing up 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.130
 looking for food and water 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.229
 the first monster meets charlie 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.620
 is a huge colossus called clock 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:55.960
 live 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.460
 He has four important skills around the 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.139
 Hand on really hard damage 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.639
 handing out with his celebration board 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:02.380
 he burns everything in a certain way 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:03.669
 range the dearest person is perfect around 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.900
 to approach his opponents quickly 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.270
 and to do a lot of harm 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.250
 go live with the kangoo live or in 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.870
 out sprint, and last but not least, there are 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.520
 the rock straw works similarly 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.650
 like the rock roll is tanks in left for 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.120
 Dead or alive should be in the early game 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.740
 play with care and try many 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.479
 to go wrong with big ones 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.130
 cracks creep and move in 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:22.510
 you leave no water 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.030
 footprints can turn the hunter into one 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.310
 wrong direction lead on stage 1 is 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.910
 cool as a relatively scusi so prone to 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.530
 damage 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.510
 important for the monster class yours 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.620
 life does not recharge on her 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.270
 you can only sign up 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.070
 Eat the hand first 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.289
 have to destroy before they live your life 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.970
 can hurt at the beginning of the game and 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:41.950
 every time you get one level 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.660
 further developed you can get 30 points 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.729
 to distribute your skills 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.990
 you would be important wolfens you can 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:48.610
 do not move or would be 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.289
 So look for a quiet place where you 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.300
 be undisturbed for about ten seconds 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:53.860
 could be the monster in the second level 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.300
 you are already essential 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.650
 dangerous and can easily a 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.180
 badly positioned that hunter team 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.889
 take apart the maximum level 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.840
 which can reach the monster is the 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:03.190
 third stage here you should with you 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.910
 a full shield is best still with 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.890
 a thing armed by a brook 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.810
 nightlife mock gets you into the endgame 

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:11.180
 go you win if all four 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:13.600
 hunter plus dog are dead or if you are 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:17.330
 could attack the powerplay of the hand 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:19.550
 So my conclusion is the 4 versus 1 kracher e 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.750
 wolf the game brings a lot of fun 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.310
 and if it is initially confusing 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.900
 it appears that you climb very fast into the 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.850
 classes and their skills a 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.320
 a good monster to play much more 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.580
 initially the hardest at the beginning 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.860
 but even there you understand quickly 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.180
 the important mechanics and tactics in the 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.620
 Above all, the trade team really enjoys it 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.120
 if you play together with friends 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.860
 can because nothing is more annoying than a 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.270
 hit which always hangs behind and 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.010
 The monster does not catch in time 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:43.010
 or a support of the minute one 

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:44.390
 afk is the game has great potential 

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:46.370
 and if there are still individual characters 

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:48.110
 adapts and maybe nerds then stands 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.770
 for hours, the fun monsters nothing 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.750
 more in the way 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.730
 it continues with the wolf then in 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.860
 january with the open beta on the xbox 

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:56.090
 one again a closed beta on the 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.990
 other system appears so far 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.960
 not clear yet 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:01.430

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.940
 implemented by me already for one 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.940
 safe purchase 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.610
 that was my big test for 

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.419
 big alpha from evolve i hope you 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.610
 had fun with it 

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:19.110
 what you think of the wolf alpha or 

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:20.580
 Generally from the game you can me in 

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:21.990
 I wanted to tell the comments 

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:24.380

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:26.430

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.620
