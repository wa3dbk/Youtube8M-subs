Mrs. Roshini what are you going to make for us?
Chicken Seekh Kabab

00:00:50.787 --> 00:00:57.747
Normally you would use a grill but we're going to use a frying pan

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:24.108
Ingredients required to make Chicken Seekh Kabab

00:01:24.328 --> 00:01:30.952
Chicken, Pepper, Cinnamon, Cloves, Mint Leaves, Coriander, Green Chillies,

00:01:31.092 --> 00:01:40.975
Onions, Ginger-Garlic Paste, Roasted Chick Pea Powder, Coriander Seeds Powder,
 Sambar Powder, Salt, Chilli Powder, Turmeric, Oil

00:01:47.236 --> 00:02:04.155
First take 1/2 kg boneless chicken and grind it in a mixer (raw). 
Then add some roasted chick pea powder (5 tbsp)

00:02:11.124 --> 00:02:20.497
Add 8 cloves, 8 cinnamon pieces, 1 tbsp coriander seeds powder,
 some chopped mint and coriander leaves.

00:02:21.775 --> 00:02:42.351
Add a pinch of turmeric and pepper. Finely chopped onions and green chillies.
Add little sambar masala and some ginger-garlic paste.

00:02:43.227 --> 00:02:45.924
Now, mix all these ingredients well with the ground chicken

00:02:55.964 --> 00:03:05.548
Take some ground chicken and make a thin and long tube like kabab

00:03:07.458 --> 00:03:25.261
Take a barbeque skew or a cooking metal skew and place it within the tube like chicken kabab
so as to make sure the chicken binds to the skew and roll it.

00:03:47.046 --> 00:03:52.494
Take a pan and heat some oil

00:04:11.517 --> 00:04:19.681
Fry the kababs with the skews till the chicken is properly cooked.
Keep turning the skew to make sure the chicken cooks evenly

00:04:38.797 --> 00:04:41.737
Serve with garnishing of your choice
