tutorial<00:00:14.960> while<00:00:15.889> you've<00:00:16.070> gone<00:00:16.250> I<00:00:16.460> made<00:00:16.670> some

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:16.850 
tutorial while you've gone I made some

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.290 
tutorial while you've gone I made some
changes<00:00:17.120> to<00:00:17.450> the<00:00:17.840> C<00:00:18.520> well<00:00:19.520> I<00:00:19.550> changed<00:00:19.910> it<00:00:20.180> into

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
changes to the C well I changed it into

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.359 
changes to the C well I changed it into
like<00:00:20.720> a<00:00:20.750> tub<00:00:21.110> of<00:00:21.140> water<00:00:21.440> just<00:00:21.890> because<00:00:22.070> it's

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
like a tub of water just because it's

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.360 
like a tub of water just because it's
easier<00:00:23.150> to<00:00:23.510> do<00:00:24.080> so<00:00:24.710> you<00:00:24.800> don't<00:00:24.980> have<00:00:25.040> to<00:00:25.160> worry

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:25.370 
easier to do so you don't have to worry

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.520 
easier to do so you don't have to worry
about<00:00:25.460> the<00:00:25.880> edges<00:00:26.000> and<00:00:26.420> stuff<00:00:26.600> and<00:00:27.020> also<00:00:27.410> it

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:27.530 
about the edges and stuff and also it

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.380 
about the edges and stuff and also it
looks<00:00:27.740> a<00:00:27.980> bit<00:00:28.010> better<00:00:28.430> when<00:00:28.670> the<00:00:28.910> water<00:00:29.120> is

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
looks a bit better when the water is

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.709 
looks a bit better when the water is
pouring<00:00:29.690> in<00:00:30.100> like<00:00:31.100> I'll<00:00:31.280> show<00:00:31.310> you<00:00:31.550> it<00:00:32.419> looks<00:00:32.630> a

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
pouring in like I'll show you it looks a

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:36.729 
pouring in like I'll show you it looks a
bit<00:00:32.750> better<00:00:34.809> alright<00:00:35.809> so<00:00:36.290> I'm<00:00:36.350> just<00:00:36.379> gonna<00:00:36.530> get

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
bit better alright so I'm just gonna get

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:38.470 
bit better alright so I'm just gonna get
started<00:00:37.190> so<00:00:37.700> you<00:00:37.730> want<00:00:38.059> to<00:00:38.149> make<00:00:38.270> a<00:00:38.300> new

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
started so you want to make a new

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.599 
started so you want to make a new
document<00:00:38.660> for<00:00:39.260> now<00:00:39.379> this<00:00:39.769> just<00:00:40.039> so<00:00:40.280> we<00:00:40.429> don't

00:00:40.599 --> 00:00:40.609 
document for now this just so we don't

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:42.610 
document for now this just so we don't
have<00:00:40.670> to<00:00:40.850> fiddle<00:00:41.059> with<00:00:41.239> all<00:00:41.539> the<00:00:41.749> moving<00:00:42.469> and

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
have to fiddle with all the moving and

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.970 
have to fiddle with all the moving and
stuff<00:00:42.859> later<00:00:43.160> on<00:00:43.399> it's<00:00:43.730> just<00:00:43.879> easier<00:00:44.269> to<00:00:44.390> see

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
stuff later on it's just easier to see

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.139 
stuff later on it's just easier to see
so<00:00:45.980> you'll<00:00:46.219> just<00:00:46.370> want<00:00:46.519> to<00:00:46.550> create<00:00:46.820> five

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
so you'll just want to create five

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.060 
so you'll just want to create five
spheres<00:00:47.629> and<00:00:47.929> you'll<00:00:48.320> just<00:00:48.469> do<00:00:48.649> that<00:00:48.859> by

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
spheres and you'll just do that by

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.970 
spheres and you'll just do that by
creating<00:00:49.940> one<00:00:50.390> pressing<00:00:50.960> ctrl<00:00:51.350> C<00:00:51.620> and<00:00:51.829> just

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
creating one pressing ctrl C and just

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.029 
creating one pressing ctrl C and just
pasting<00:00:52.429> it<00:00:52.550> four<00:00:52.789> times<00:00:53.800> you<00:00:54.800> want<00:00:54.949> to

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
pasting it four times you want to

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.549 
pasting it four times you want to
highlight<00:00:55.249> all<00:00:55.609> of<00:00:55.640> them<00:00:57.339> one<00:00:58.339> second

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
highlight all of them one second

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.349 
highlight all of them one second
highlight<00:01:00.559> all<00:01:00.949> of<00:01:00.979> them<00:01:01.309> I<00:01:01.550> don't<00:01:02.179> want<00:01:02.300> to

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
highlight all of them I don't want to

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:07.230 
highlight all of them I don't want to
scale<00:01:02.629> them<00:01:02.870> down<00:01:02.899> to<00:01:03.409> about<00:01:04.210> that<00:01:05.210> size<00:01:05.950> and

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
scale them down to about that size and

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.740 
scale them down to about that size and
then<00:01:08.240> you<00:01:08.330> go<00:01:08.450> spread<00:01:08.900> each<00:01:09.260> each<00:01:10.010> one

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
then you go spread each each one

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.819 
then you go spread each each one
outwards<00:01:11.979> from<00:01:12.979> where<00:01:13.250> it<00:01:13.430> was<00:01:13.610> now<00:01:14.649> so<00:01:15.649> it's

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:15.829 
outwards from where it was now so it's

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:20.109 
outwards from where it was now so it's
like<00:01:16.040> in<00:01:16.340> a<00:01:16.780> shape<00:01:17.780> of<00:01:18.159> like<00:01:19.159> a<00:01:19.219> diamond<00:01:19.909> if<00:01:20.030> you

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
like in a shape of like a diamond if you

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.120 
like in a shape of like a diamond if you
know<00:01:20.270> I<00:01:20.299> mean<00:01:20.600> like<00:01:21.290> say<00:01:21.619> after<00:01:21.860> spreading

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
know I mean like say after spreading

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.459 
know I mean like say after spreading
them<00:01:22.369> out<00:01:22.549> one<00:01:23.270> by<00:01:23.299> one<00:01:23.750> like<00:01:24.560> this<00:01:26.320> you<00:01:27.320> get

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:27.469 
them out one by one like this you get

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:36.320 
them out one by one like this you get
I'm<00:01:27.680> in<00:01:28.719> logically<00:01:29.719> speeding<00:01:29.990> it<00:01:30.049> up

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.260 

all<00:01:36.870> right<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.230> there<00:01:37.380> we<00:01:37.470> have<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.910> you<00:01:38.910> go

all right so there we have it you go
back<00:01:39.450> onto<00:01:39.600> perspective<00:01:40.550> and<00:01:41.550> there<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:41.970> go

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
back onto perspective and there you go

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.940 
back onto perspective and there you go
for<00:01:42.480> now<00:01:43.070> so<00:01:44.540> you<00:01:45.540> want<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.810> go<00:01:45.930> up<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.470> where

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
for now so you want to go up to where

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.320 
for now so you want to go up to where
this<00:01:47.280> emitter<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:48.030> also<00:01:48.810> know<00:01:48.990> this<00:01:49.170> bit<00:01:49.440> and

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
this emitter is also know this bit and

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.140 
this emitter is also know this bit and
you<00:01:51.330> will<00:01:51.420> go<00:01:51.690> to<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.960> meter<00:01:52.350> ball<00:01:52.710> here<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.160> you

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
you will go to a meter ball here and you

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.730 
you will go to a meter ball here and you
all<00:01:54.360> know<00:01:54.510> group<00:01:55.110> your<00:01:56.070> spheres<00:01:57.530> so<00:01:58.530> right

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
all know group your spheres so right

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.010 
all know group your spheres so right
click<00:01:58.950> group<00:01:59.640> objects<00:02:00.150> and<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.630> will<00:02:00.750> drag

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.920 
click group objects and you will drag
this<00:02:01.170> under<00:02:01.620> the<00:02:01.740> meter<00:02:01.920> ball<00:02:02.190> and<00:02:02.660> as<00:02:03.660> you<00:02:03.780> can

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
this under the meter ball and as you can

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.510 
this under the meter ball and as you can
see<00:02:04.110> it's<00:02:04.260> already<00:02:04.470> grouped<00:02:04.980> them<00:02:05.190> up<00:02:05.340> into

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
see it's already grouped them up into

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.680 
see it's already grouped them up into
some<00:02:06.290> liquid<00:02:07.290> sort<00:02:07.650> shape<00:02:08.300> obviously<00:02:09.300> you're

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
some liquid sort shape obviously you're

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.140 
some liquid sort shape obviously you're
gonna<00:02:09.810> have<00:02:09.960> two<00:02:10.080> hypernurb<00:02:10.710> it<00:02:12.920> and<00:02:14.150> that

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
gonna have two hypernurb it and that

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.040 
gonna have two hypernurb it and that
makes<00:02:15.420> it<00:02:15.510> all<00:02:15.660> smooth<00:02:17.510> so<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:18.630> might<00:02:18.810> want<00:02:18.990> to

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
makes it all smooth so you might want to

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.020

fiddle<00:02:19.440> around<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:20.010> drag<00:02:20.280> them<00:02:20.460> in<00:02:20.580> a<00:02:20.610> bit<00:02:20.820> but

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
fiddle around and drag them in a bit but

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.690 
fiddle around and drag them in a bit but
I'm<00:02:21.090> not<00:02:21.240> gonna<00:02:21.360> do<00:02:21.540> that<00:02:21.570> for<00:02:21.900> now<00:02:22.020> so<00:02:22.700> there

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
and you will go back to your original

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.780 
and you will go back to your original
document<00:02:33.740> all<00:02:34.740> right<00:02:34.920> to<00:02:35.040> get<00:02:35.190> started<00:02:35.640> you

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
document all right to get started you

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.120 
document all right to get started you
want<00:02:35.970> to<00:02:36.030> make<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.180> sphere<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:37.350> you<00:02:37.770> want<00:02:37.950> that

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
want to make a sphere and you want that

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.720 
want to make a sphere and you want that
to<00:02:38.190> make<00:02:38.550> that<00:02:38.790> radius<00:02:39.300> about<00:02:39.530> 50<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:40.730> genève

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
to make that radius about 50 and genève

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.060 
to make that radius about 50 and genève
is<00:02:41.850> that<00:02:42.120> so<00:02:42.930> you<00:02:43.020> only<00:02:43.170> make<00:02:43.320> an<00:02:43.440> emitter<00:02:43.680> and

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
is that so you only make an emitter and

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.150 
is that so you only make an emitter and
you<00:02:44.670> will<00:02:44.790> drag<00:02:45.060> your<00:02:45.209> emitter<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:46.440> like<00:02:46.709> how

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
you will drag your emitter to like how

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.310 
you will drag your emitter to like how
you<00:02:47.220> want<00:02:47.520> the<00:02:47.640> water<00:02:47.850> to<00:02:48.060> come<00:02:48.390> out<00:02:48.450> of<00:02:48.840> like

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
you want the water to come out of like

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.430 
you want the water to come out of like
legit<00:02:49.739> or<00:02:50.010> whatever<00:02:50.720> so<00:02:51.720> I'm<00:02:52.110> just<00:02:52.230> going<00:02:52.410> to

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
legit or whatever so I'm just going to

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.260 
legit or whatever so I'm just going to
drag<00:02:52.560> it<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:52.860> edge<00:02:53.150> and<00:02:55.459> we<00:02:56.459> rotate<00:02:57.090> it

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
drag it to the edge and we rotate it

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.240 
drag it to the edge and we rotate it
down<00:02:57.300> so<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:57.959> ends<00:02:58.290> up<00:02:58.380> falling<00:02:58.650> down<00:02:58.830> like

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
down so it ends up falling down like

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.979 
down so it ends up falling down like
that<00:03:01.459> all<00:03:02.459> right<00:03:02.700> so<00:03:02.850> it's<00:03:02.970> good<00:03:03.209> drag<00:03:03.660> the

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
that all right so it's good drag the

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:09.860 
that all right so it's good drag the
sphere<00:03:04.470> as<00:03:04.800> a<00:03:05.180> child<00:03:06.180> of<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.540> emitter<00:03:07.160> and<00:03:08.870> if

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
sphere as a child of the emitter and if

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.720 
sphere as a child of the emitter and if
I<00:03:10.050> play<00:03:10.350> that<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:10.800> click<00:03:11.070> show<00:03:11.459> objects<00:03:13.730> it

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
I play that and click show objects it

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.949 
I play that and click show objects it
just<00:03:14.940> shows<00:03:15.150> how<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.739> Bulls<00:03:16.739> just<00:03:17.900> sort<00:03:18.900> of

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
just shows how the Bulls just sort of

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.040 
just shows how the Bulls just sort of
hover<00:03:19.680> in<00:03:20.010> midair<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:20.700> just<00:03:20.910> blob<00:03:21.480> like<00:03:21.780> that

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
hover in midair and just blob like that

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.260 
hover in midair and just blob like that
it<00:03:22.320> doesn't<00:03:22.680> look<00:03:22.800> like<00:03:22.980> water<00:03:23.190> yet<00:03:23.489> that's

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
it doesn't look like water yet that's

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.199 
it doesn't look like water yet that's
where<00:03:24.480> meter<00:03:24.690> balls<00:03:24.989> comes<00:03:25.290> in<00:03:25.610> you<00:03:26.610> just<00:03:26.880> get

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
where meter balls comes in you just get

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.610 
where meter balls comes in you just get
the<00:03:27.360> meter<00:03:27.570> ball<00:03:27.840> when<00:03:28.020> you<00:03:28.080> inject<00:03:28.440> the

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
the meter ball when you inject the

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.240 
the meter ball when you inject the
emitter<00:03:28.890> as<00:03:29.190> a<00:03:29.220> child<00:03:29.640> of<00:03:29.820> the<00:03:29.880> meatball

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
emitter as a child of the meatball

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.220 
emitter as a child of the meatball
and<00:03:32.400> as<00:03:32.820> you<00:03:32.940> can<00:03:33.030> see<00:03:33.270> it's<00:03:33.450> already<00:03:33.810> kind<00:03:34.140> of

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
and as you can see it's already kind of

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.350 
and as you can see it's already kind of
looking<00:03:34.590> a<00:03:34.830> bit<00:03:35.280> water<00:03:35.520> like<00:03:35.850> but<00:03:36.120> it's<00:03:36.330> kind

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
looking a bit water like but it's kind

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.690 
looking a bit water like but it's kind
of<00:03:36.660> blocking<00:03:37.170> up<00:03:37.380> but<00:03:38.160> you<00:03:38.220> can<00:03:38.370> sort<00:03:38.550> that<00:03:38.640> out

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
of blocking up but you can sort that out

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.470 
of blocking up but you can sort that out
by<00:03:39.800> changing<00:03:40.800> a<00:03:40.860> few<00:03:41.100> emitter<00:03:41.400> six<00:03:41.730> settings

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
by changing a few emitter six settings

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.170 
by changing a few emitter six settings
like<00:03:42.960> the<00:03:43.110> speed<00:03:43.470> and<00:03:43.830> the<00:03:44.760> lifetime<00:03:47.180> so

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
like the speed and the lifetime so

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.770 
like the speed and the lifetime so
change<00:03:48.480> that<00:03:48.630> to<00:03:48.810> about<00:03:49.020> 300<00:03:49.740> maybe<00:03:49.950> and

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
change that to about 300 maybe and

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:58.310 
change that to about 300 maybe and
lifetime<00:03:51.780> to<00:03:52.050> about<00:03:55.490> 100<00:03:56.490> I<00:03:56.610> know<00:03:57.170> and<00:03:58.170> just

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
lifetime to about 100 I know and just

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.050 
lifetime to about 100 I know and just
press<00:03:58.560> play<00:04:00.440> it's<00:04:01.440> not<00:04:01.620> as<00:04:01.740> bad<00:04:01.950> but<00:04:02.030> you<00:04:03.030> can

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
press play it's not as bad but you can

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.040 
press play it's not as bad but you can
fill<00:04:03.420> around<00:04:03.750> with<00:04:03.900> some<00:04:04.080> settings<00:04:05.660> so<00:04:06.660> now

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
fill around with some settings so now

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.770 
fill around with some settings so now
you<00:04:07.110> want<00:04:07.320> to<00:04:07.350> add<00:04:07.530> a<00:04:07.800> gravity<00:04:08.460> object<00:04:09.000> that's

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
you want to add a gravity object that's

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.870 
you want to add a gravity object that's
in<00:04:09.990> the<00:04:10.080> same<00:04:10.350> pause<00:04:10.710> and<00:04:11.070> metallics<00:04:11.640> that<00:04:11.730> you

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
in the same pause and metallics that you

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.410 
in the same pause and metallics that you
have<00:04:12.000> to<00:04:12.120> hold<00:04:12.300> down<00:04:12.390> you<00:04:12.690> get<00:04:12.900> the<00:04:12.990> menu<00:04:13.350> and

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
have to hold down you get the menu and

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.050 
have to hold down you get the menu and
usually<00:04:15.420> like<00:04:15.600> them<00:04:16.670> you<00:04:17.670> don't<00:04:17.940> need

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
usually like them you don't need

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.740 
usually like them you don't need
trekking<00:04:18.420> meter<00:04:18.630> bombs<00:04:18.900> or<00:04:19.310> and<00:04:20.540> that<00:04:21.540> just

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
trekking meter bombs or and that just

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.560 
trekking meter bombs or and that just
applies<00:04:22.049> gravity<00:04:22.640> and<00:04:23.640> makes<00:04:23.970> it<00:04:24.120> fall<00:04:24.360> down

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
applies gravity and makes it fall down

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:30.740 
applies gravity and makes it fall down
like<00:04:25.500> that<00:04:25.740> so<00:04:27.410> I'll<00:04:28.410> apply<00:04:28.680> like<00:04:29.130> a<00:04:29.750> texture

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
like that so I'll apply like a texture

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.990 
like that so I'll apply like a texture
to<00:04:30.780> that<00:04:30.960> maybe<00:04:31.440> the<00:04:31.680> same<00:04:31.950> texture<00:04:32.790> as<00:04:32.970> the

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
to that maybe the same texture as the

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.420 
to that maybe the same texture as the
water<00:04:33.720> you<00:04:34.050> had<00:04:34.230> although<00:04:34.800> I<00:04:34.950> recommend

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
water you had although I recommend

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.260 
water you had although I recommend
making<00:04:35.850> it<00:04:36.120> a<00:04:36.180> bit<00:04:36.360> lighter<00:04:36.720> because<00:04:37.650> it's

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
making it a bit lighter because it's

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.600 
making it a bit lighter because it's
illuminated<00:04:39.270> by<00:04:39.480> the<00:04:39.510> Sun<00:04:39.720> all<00:04:40.350> around<00:04:40.800> unlike

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
illuminated by the Sun all around unlike

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.670 
illuminated by the Sun all around unlike
that<00:04:41.850> pull<00:04:42.180> so<00:04:42.960> you<00:04:43.020> won't<00:04:43.169> make<00:04:43.260> a<00:04:43.320> texture

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
that pull so you won't make a texture

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.560 
that pull so you won't make a texture
that's<00:04:43.770> slightly<00:04:44.430> lighter<00:04:44.700> then<00:04:45.060> your<00:04:45.390> water

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
that's slightly lighter then your water

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.860 
that's slightly lighter then your water
color<00:04:46.020> and<00:04:46.910> you're<00:04:47.910> just<00:04:48.030> gonna<00:04:48.210> drag<00:04:48.570> that

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
color and you're just gonna drag that

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.190 
color and you're just gonna drag that
onto<00:04:49.169> your<00:04:49.650> meter<00:04:49.890> ball<00:04:50.190> or<00:04:50.490> emitter<00:04:50.790> oh<00:04:51.200> the

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
onto your meter ball or emitter oh the

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.050 
onto your meter ball or emitter oh the
sphere<00:04:52.470> and

emitter<00:05:36.180> or<00:05:36.330> something<00:05:36.780> to<00:05:36.900> make<00:05:37.020> it<00:05:37.080> look

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:37.230
