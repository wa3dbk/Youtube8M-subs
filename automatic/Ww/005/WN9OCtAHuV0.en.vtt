youtube<00:00:41.879> because<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:43.280> went<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.430> UM<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:45.000> do<00:00:45.120> the

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
youtube because I went to UM to do the

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.010 
youtube because I went to UM to do the
collectibles<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:46.579> Whiterun<00:00:47.660> and<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.780> turns

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
collectibles of Whiterun and it turns

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.690 
collectibles of Whiterun and it turns
out<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.230> most<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.860> these<00:00:49.980> collectibles

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
out that most of these collectibles

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.139 
out that most of these collectibles
these<00:00:51.149> unique<00:00:51.570> items<00:00:52.079> are<00:00:52.230> part<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.190> quests<00:00:53.730> so

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
these unique items are part of quests so

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.090 
these unique items are part of quests so
there<00:00:54.809> really<00:00:54.930> isn't<00:00:55.199> any<00:00:55.500> point<00:00:55.770> in<00:00:55.920> putting

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
there really isn't any point in putting

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.369 
there really isn't any point in putting
that<00:00:56.280> on<00:00:56.430> youtube<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.539> was<00:00:57.690> an<00:00:57.809> absolute

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
that on youtube so it was an absolute

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.639 
that on youtube so it was an absolute
waste<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:59.039> my<00:00:59.219> time<00:00:59.930> why<00:01:00.930> I'm<00:01:01.140> going<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.410> put<00:01:01.559> on

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
waste of my time why I'm going to put on

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.399 
waste of my time why I'm going to put on
YouTube<00:01:02.039> though<00:01:02.600> and<00:01:03.600> that's<00:01:03.780> if<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:03.960> can<00:01:03.989> do<00:01:04.260> it

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
YouTube though and that's if I can do it

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.940
