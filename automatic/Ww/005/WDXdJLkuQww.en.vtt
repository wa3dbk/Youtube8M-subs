it's been absolutely sick deck I mean
for<00:00:15.839> carving<00:00:16.199> you<00:00:16.350> don't<00:00:16.529> have<00:00:16.680> trucks<00:00:17.070> pretty

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
for carving you don't have trucks pretty

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
top at the top where the deck is mounted

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.900 
top at the top where the deck is mounted
on<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.750> trucks<00:00:34.079> it's<00:00:34.380> high<00:00:34.739> up<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.190> then<00:00:35.790> the

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
on the trucks it's high up and then the

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.970 
on the trucks it's high up and then the
deck<00:00:36.120> actually<00:00:36.480> drops<00:00:36.870> down<00:00:37.290> as<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.710> can<00:00:37.860> see

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
deck actually drops down as you can see

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.000 
deck actually drops down as you can see
here<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.570> it<00:00:39.570> had<00:00:40.500> these<00:00:40.710> things<00:00:40.860> called

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
here and it had these things called

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.510 
here and it had these things called
thing<00:00:41.489> called<00:00:41.640> narrow<00:00:41.910> bars<00:00:42.149> where<00:00:42.989> there's

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
thing called narrow bars where there's

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.979 
thing called narrow bars where there's
practically<00:00:44.520> no<00:00:44.850> con<00:00:45.180> game<00:00:45.450> it's<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.750> little

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
practically no con game it's a little

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.869 
practically no con game it's a little
bit<00:00:46.110> lower<00:00:46.350> than<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.800> rest<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.219> platform

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
bit lower than the rest of the platform

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.209 
bit lower than the rest of the platform
and<00:00:48.090> right<00:00:48.989> here<00:00:49.230> it's<00:00:49.530> like<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.739> good<00:00:49.920> place<00:00:50.039> to

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
and right here it's like a good place to

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.459 
and right here it's like a good place to
plant<00:00:50.399> your<00:00:50.520> feet<00:00:50.789> for<00:00:51.030> stand<00:00:51.270> up<00:00:51.390> slides<00:00:51.690> and

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
plant your feet for stand up slides and

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.279 
plant your feet for stand up slides and
also<00:00:52.739> just<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.129> lot<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.460> different<00:00:53.489> sides<00:00:53.910> also

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
also just a lot of different sides also

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:57.229 
also just a lot of different sides also
but<00:00:55.289> as<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.559> deck<00:00:55.739> progresses<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.789> concave

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
but as the deck progresses the concave

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.099 
but as the deck progresses the concave
slowly<00:00:57.829> if<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.370> concave<00:00:59.820> slowly<00:01:00.329> builds<00:01:00.960> up

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
slowly if the concave slowly builds up

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.560 
slowly if the concave slowly builds up
and<00:01:01.410> at<00:01:02.399> one<00:01:02.640> point<00:01:02.670> in<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.030> middle<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.420> the

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
and at one point in the middle of the

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.509 
and at one point in the middle of the
deck<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.320> concave<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:04.860> actually<00:01:05.220> really

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
deck the concave is actually really

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.260 
deck the concave is actually really
extreme<00:01:06.290> but<00:01:07.290> this<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:07.890> w<00:01:08.369> part<00:01:08.760> in<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:08.939> middle

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
extreme but this is w part in the middle

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.149 
extreme but this is w part in the middle
where<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.600> actually<00:01:09.750> goes<00:01:10.110> up<00:01:10.320> which<00:01:10.920> helps

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
where it actually goes up which helps

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.060 
where it actually goes up which helps
you<00:01:11.220> keep<00:01:11.400> your<00:01:11.610> feet<00:01:11.820> secure<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.080> now<00:01:13.590> I'm

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
you keep your feet secure and now I'm

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.499 
you keep your feet secure and now I'm
comfortable<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.939> middle<00:01:15.180> part<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.420> the

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
comfortable in the middle part of the

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.120 
comfortable in the middle part of the
day<00:01:15.630> but<00:01:15.930> usually<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.530> don't<00:01:16.650> put<00:01:16.860> your<00:01:16.920> feet

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
day but usually you don't put your feet

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.840 
day but usually you don't put your feet
there<00:01:17.369> anyways<00:01:18.020> so<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.439> then<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.580> gradually

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
there anyways so and then it gradually

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.120 
there anyways so and then it gradually
goes<00:01:21.240> back<00:01:21.509> down<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.560> each<00:01:22.830> side<00:01:23.100> is

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
goes back down and each side is

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.550 
goes back down and each side is
symmetrical<00:01:23.970> each<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.869> helps<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.409> when

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
symmetrical each so that helps you when

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.980 
symmetrical each so that helps you when
you're<00:01:25.710> doing<00:01:25.890> Peggy's<00:01:26.280> or<00:01:26.430> whities<00:01:26.880> if<00:01:27.119> you

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
you're doing Peggy's or whities if you

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.390 
you're doing Peggy's or whities if you
don't<00:01:28.140> when<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.650> have<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.829> pen<00:01:29.009> d<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.280> don't

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
don't when you have a pen d you don't

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.219 
don't when you have a pen d you don't
have<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.729> Opera<00:01:30.030> feel<00:01:30.210> if<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.509> do<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.780> 180

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
have the Opera feel if you do the 180

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.929 
have the Opera feel if you do the 180
hook<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.770> board<00:01:32.009> going<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.310> long<00:01:32.460> way<00:01:32.670> that

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
hook the board going to long way that

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.450 
hook the board going to long way that
and<00:01:33.210> we<00:01:33.990> just<00:01:34.020> do<00:01:34.290> 180<00:01:34.710> it's<00:01:34.920> much<00:01:35.040> easier<00:01:35.070> to

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
and we just do 180 it's much easier to

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.890 
and we just do 180 it's much easier to
write<00:01:35.670> out<00:01:35.820> switch<00:01:36.150> because<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.630> board<00:01:36.810> is

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
write out switch because the board is

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.810 
write out switch because the board is
still<00:01:37.049> normal<00:01:37.320> because<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:38.280> deck<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.549> made

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
still normal because this deck is made

52 so i got this board but if you're
taller<00:02:33.450> you<00:02:33.750> can<00:02:33.930> always<00:02:34.170> just<00:02:34.290> go<00:02:34.349> get<00:02:34.530> this

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
taller you can always just go get this

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.740 
taller you can always just go get this

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
switch because this board really isn't

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.380 
switch because this board really isn't
that<00:02:36.900> long<00:02:37.140> so<00:02:37.530> if<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:38.549> need<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:38.760> longer<00:02:39.060> board

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
how well they slide compared to these

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.930 
how well they slide compared to these
wheels<00:03:26.639> and<00:03:27.560> they<00:03:28.560> just<00:03:28.709> they<00:03:29.489> breaking<00:03:29.760> this

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
wheels and they just they breaking this

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.699 
wheels and they just they breaking this
like<00:03:30.120> so<00:03:30.480> easily<00:03:30.750> and<00:03:31.200> they<00:03:31.290> maintain<00:03:31.680> a

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
like so easily and they maintain a

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.740 
like so easily and they maintain a
really<00:03:32.040> well<00:03:32.190> so<00:03:32.519> but<00:03:33.329> even<00:03:33.450> though<00:03:33.569> they're

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
really well so but even though they're

really well so but even though they're
really<00:03:33.959> good<00:03:34.109> sliding<00:03:34.380> wheels<00:03:34.709> they're<00:03:34.920> not

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
really good sliding wheels they're not

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
worn out wheels there's like but there's

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.220 
worn out wheels there's like but there's
little<00:04:10.530> ruts<00:04:10.829> on<00:04:11.040> the<00:04:11.160> top<00:04:11.340> of<00:04:11.370> it<00:04:11.669> and<00:04:12.230> right

little ruts on the top of it and right
right<00:04:13.709> off<00:04:13.829> the<00:04:13.859> bat<00:04:14.160> they<00:04:14.340> slide<00:04:14.549> perfectly

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
right off the bat they slide perfectly

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.090 
right off the bat they slide perfectly
like<00:04:15.180> they<00:04:15.299> were<00:04:15.360> worn<00:04:15.569> down<00:04:15.750> maybe

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
like they were worn down maybe

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.130 
like they were worn down maybe
but<00:04:17.880> maybe<00:04:18.120> you<00:04:18.330> might<00:04:18.510> get<00:04:18.690> a<00:04:18.720> couple<00:04:19.050> of

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
but maybe you might get a couple of

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.570 
but maybe you might get a couple of
little<00:04:19.350> chunks<00:04:19.680> out<00:04:19.890> of<00:04:19.950> the<00:04:20.100> sides<00:04:20.310> if<00:04:20.520> you

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
little chunks out of the sides if you

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.130 
little chunks out of the sides if you
don't<00:04:20.730> like<00:04:20.910> Ryan<00:04:21.570> for<00:04:21.780> a<00:04:21.810> couple<00:04:22.050> days

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
don't like Ryan for a couple days

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.260 
don't like Ryan for a couple days
beforehand<00:04:22.710> but<00:04:22.950> I<00:04:23.220> mean<00:04:23.700> I<00:04:23.910> don't<00:04:24.240> really

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
beforehand but I mean I don't really

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.640 
beforehand but I mean I don't really
care<00:04:24.570> i<00:04:24.630> just<00:04:24.720> want<00:04:24.900> to<00:04:25.050> ride<00:04:25.260> i'm<00:04:25.380> straight<00:04:25.560> up

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
care i just want to ride i'm straight up

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.570 
care i just want to ride i'm straight up
with<00:04:25.800> that<00:04:25.920> because<00:04:26.040> these<00:04:26.190> things<00:04:26.400> were

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
with that because these things were

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.700 
with that because these things were
three<00:04:26.760> these<00:04:27.540> rules<00:04:27.780> are<00:04:27.930> definitely<00:04:28.380> really

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
three these rules are definitely really

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.040 
three these rules are definitely really
hard<00:04:28.980> if<00:04:29.310> you<00:04:29.670> don't<00:04:30.090> want<00:04:30.360> wheels<00:04:30.810> that<00:04:31.020> are

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
hard if you don't want wheels that are

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.330 
hard if you don't want wheels that are
as<00:04:31.200> hard<00:04:31.410> but<00:04:31.590> you<00:04:31.680> still<00:04:31.920> want<00:04:32.100> the<00:04:32.160> right

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
as hard but you still want the right

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.480 
as hard but you still want the right

just<00:04:44.220> get<00:04:44.340> the<00:04:44.870> orangatang<00:04:45.870> Darien's<00:04:46.470> or<00:04:46.710> the

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:46.920 
just get the orangatang Darien's or the

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.980 
just get the orangatang Darien's or the
fat-free<00:04:47.490> wheels<00:04:47.910> the<00:04:48.150> same<00:04:48.330> as<00:04:48.480> that<00:04:48.570> model

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
fat-free wheels the same as that model

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.710 
fat-free wheels the same as that model
but<00:04:49.590> the<00:04:49.860> there's<00:04:50.400> bigger<00:04:50.700> smaller<00:04:51.240> I<00:04:51.510> mean<00:04:51.690> I

but the there's bigger smaller I mean I

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.880 
but the there's bigger smaller I mean I
chose<00:04:51.990> this<00:04:52.020> field<00:04:52.350> because<00:04:52.500> it<00:04:52.710> was<00:04:52.800> in

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
chose this field because it was in

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.370 
chose this field because it was in
between<00:04:53.010> because<00:04:53.850> I<00:04:54.300> just<00:04:54.870> felt<00:04:55.020> like<00:04:55.080> I<00:04:55.260> have

between because I just felt like I have

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.290 
between because I just felt like I have
like<00:04:55.410> a<00:04:55.590> mid-sized<00:04:55.980> board<00:04:56.370> now<00:04:56.910> I<00:04:56.940> kind<00:04:57.270> of

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
like a mid-sized board now I kind of

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.400 
like a mid-sized board now I kind of
think<00:04:57.420> I<00:04:57.540> should<00:04:57.570> have<00:04:57.780> got<00:04:57.870> the<00:04:57.990> Dorian's

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
think I should have got the Dorian's

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.230 
think I should have got the Dorian's
because<00:04:58.800> its<00:04:58.980> board<00:04:59.250> they<00:04:59.730> seem<00:04:59.970> a<00:05:00.000> little

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
because its board they seem a little

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.570 
because its board they seem a little
small<00:05:00.600> on<00:05:00.630> it<00:05:00.900> but<00:05:01.140> so<00:05:01.920> they<00:05:02.100> fit<00:05:02.280> pretty<00:05:02.460> well

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
small on it but so they fit pretty well

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.700 
small on it but so they fit pretty well
overall<00:05:03.330> for<00:05:03.720> what<00:05:03.840> they<00:05:03.990> are<00:05:04.020> I'd<00:05:04.380> give<00:05:04.560> these

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
overall for what they are I'd give these

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.980 
overall for what they are I'd give these
wheels<00:05:04.950> a<00:05:05.040> 10<00:05:05.220> out<00:05:05.370> of<00:05:05.430> 10<00:05:05.520> because<00:05:05.880> I<00:05:06.330> mean

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
wheels a 10 out of 10 because I mean

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
wheels a 10 out of 10 because I mean
there<00:05:07.800> it's<00:05:08.670> like<00:05:08.940> great<00:05:09.360> for<00:05:09.690> any<00:05:09.930> 486<00:05:10.560> and

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
there it's like great for any 486 and

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.650 
there it's like great for any 486 and
they<00:05:11.100> definitely<00:05:11.310> slide<00:05:11.820> really<00:05:12.210> well<00:05:12.390> you

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
they definitely slide really well you

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.150 
they definitely slide really well you
can<00:05:13.110> hold<00:05:13.290> slides<00:05:13.530> for<00:05:13.740> a<00:05:13.770> really<00:05:14.010> long<00:05:14.040> time

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
can hold slides for a really long time

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.650 
can hold slides for a really long time
and<00:05:14.430> right<00:05:14.910> now<00:05:15.060> they<00:05:15.240> look<00:05:15.390> like<00:05:15.450> they

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
and right now they look like they

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.330 
and right now they look like they
haven't<00:05:15.840> really<00:05:15.960> been<00:05:16.140> used<00:05:16.500> because<00:05:17.220> I<00:05:17.310> was

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
haven't really been used because I was

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.520 
haven't really been used because I was
just<00:05:17.580> outside<00:05:17.970> and<00:05:18.330> sliding<00:05:18.990> and<00:05:19.170> it's<00:05:19.260> kind

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
just outside and sliding and it's kind

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.090 
just outside and sliding and it's kind
of<00:05:19.590> wet<00:05:19.800> so<00:05:20.460> it<00:05:20.490> took<00:05:20.730> the<00:05:20.910> dirt<00:05:21.090> off<00:05:21.300> but<00:05:21.690> I

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
of wet so it took the dirt off but I

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.070 
of wet so it took the dirt off but I
mean<00:05:23.100> they<00:05:23.280> they<00:05:23.580> definitely<00:05:24.420> slide<00:05:24.750> really

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
mean they they definitely slide really

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.190 
mean they they definitely slide really
well<00:05:25.350> right<00:05:25.650> from<00:05:25.800> the<00:05:25.950> bath<00:05:26.250> of<00:05:26.520> that<00:05:26.670> and<00:05:27.200> but

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
well right from the bath of that and but

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.620 
well right from the bath of that and but
they're<00:05:28.320> not<00:05:28.500> like<00:05:28.770> saying<00:05:29.700> slides<00:05:30.120> I<00:05:30.450> got

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630

like a really intense lime wheel but
definitely<00:05:34.230> completely<00:05:35.100> worth<00:05:35.460> the<00:05:35.580> price

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790
