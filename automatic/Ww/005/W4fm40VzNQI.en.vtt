play in there you know so I took my two
by<00:00:38.850> ten

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
by ten

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.830 
by ten
I<00:00:39.420> cut<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.960> front<00:00:40.110> off<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:41.780> you<00:00:42.780> know

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
I cut the front off of it and you know

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.020 
I cut the front off of it and you know
dumped<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.590> Celestion<00:00:44.160> he<00:00:44.730> kept<00:00:44.940> the

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
dumped the Celestion he kept the

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.549 
dumped the Celestion he kept the
Eminence<00:00:45.420> which<00:00:45.600> he<00:00:45.719> would<00:00:45.809> ask<00:00:45.960> why<00:00:46.260> would<00:00:46.320> I

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
Eminence which he would ask why would I

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.190 
Eminence which he would ask why would I
do<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.770> slaw<00:00:47.219> scenes<00:00:47.460> are<00:00:47.610> great<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:48.050> did<00:00:49.050> that

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
do that slaw scenes are great I did that

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.229 
do that slaw scenes are great I did that
mostly<00:00:49.800> because<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:50.010> speaker<00:00:50.399> design<00:00:50.579> they

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
mostly because of speaker design they

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.130 
mostly because of speaker design they
had<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.420> GL<00:00:51.870> 1035<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:53.010> then<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.899> immense<00:00:54.899> 10

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
had a GL 1035 and then the immense 10

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.869 
had a GL 1035 and then the immense 10
inch<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.350> had<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.649> there<00:00:55.829> then<00:00:56.309> instead<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.670> much

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
inch I had in there then instead a much

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.400 
inch I had in there then instead a much
tighter<00:00:57.210> cone<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:57.899> figured<00:00:58.230> with<00:00:58.379> the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
tighter cone and I figured with the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.529 
tighter cone and I figured with the
pressures<00:00:59.340> inside<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.730> cabinet<00:01:00.059> that

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
pressures inside the cabinet that

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.270 
pressures inside the cabinet that
speaker<00:01:00.930> would<00:01:01.020> hold<00:01:01.260> up<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.559> lot<00:01:01.859> better<00:01:02.129> at

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
speaker would hold up a lot better at

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.700 
speaker would hold up a lot better at
high<00:01:02.370> volume<00:01:02.760> than<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.480> soft<00:01:04.080> paper<00:01:04.350> cone

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
high volume than the soft paper cone

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.609 
high volume than the soft paper cone
Celestine<00:01:05.489> would<00:01:05.670> well<00:01:06.450> anyway<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:07.020> cab

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
Celestine would well anyway this cab

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.080 
Celestine would well anyway this cab
isn't<00:01:07.799> finished<00:01:08.010> yet<00:01:08.189> but<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.549> figured<00:01:09.000> I'd

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
isn't finished yet but I figured I'd

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.300 
isn't finished yet but I figured I'd
show<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.900> beginnings<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.890> cabinet

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
show you the beginnings of the cabinet

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.090 
show you the beginnings of the cabinet
there's<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.119> speaker<00:01:12.390> inside<00:01:12.869> some<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.830> create

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
there's a speaker inside some a create

there's a speaker inside some a create
foam<00:01:14.369> here<00:01:14.790> some<00:01:15.780> some<00:01:16.500> window<00:01:16.770> latches<00:01:16.979> I

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
foam here some some window latches I

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.920 
foam here some some window latches I
chose<00:01:17.610> these<00:01:17.880> because<00:01:17.939> as<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.479> turn<00:01:18.720> them

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
chose these because as you turn them

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.749 
chose these because as you turn them
they<00:01:19.409> tighten<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:19.920> pull<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.220> door<00:01:20.369> snug

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
they tighten and pull the door snug

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.090 
they tighten and pull the door snug
anyway<00:01:21.540> real<00:01:22.170> quick<00:01:22.350> I'll<00:01:22.500> show<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.890> proof

anyway real quick I'll show you a proof

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.310 
anyway real quick I'll show you a proof
of<00:01:23.220> concept<00:01:23.630> don't<00:01:24.630> have<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.840> mic<00:01:25.049> in<00:01:25.200> it

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320

the volume this guitar has no tone
circuit<00:01:38.850> it's<00:01:39.299> just<00:01:39.509> three<00:01:39.750> volumes<00:01:40.170> the

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
circuit it's just three volumes the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.499 
circuit it's just three volumes the
third<00:01:40.619> being<00:01:40.799> my<00:01:40.950> graphtec<00:01:41.369> ghost<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:42.240> this

third being my graphtec ghost and this
is<00:01:42.659> just<00:01:42.840> nothing<00:01:43.170> just<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.560> knob<00:01:43.770> that'll<00:01:44.460> be

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
is just nothing just a knob that'll be

going<00:01:44.610> straight<00:01:44.820> my<00:01:44.970> bugera<00:01:45.390> 1990<00:01:46.170> with<00:01:46.350> the

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
going straight my bugera 1990 with the

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.730 
going straight my bugera 1990 with the
volume<00:01:46.860> at<00:01:46.979> about<00:01:47.159> four<00:01:47.460> on<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.729> game<00:01:47.909> channel

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740

volume at about four on the game channel
my<00:01:49.740> camera<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.579> sitting<00:01:50.850> in<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.180> music<00:01:51.450> stand<00:01:51.630> so

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
my camera is sitting in a music stand so

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.480 
my camera is sitting in a music stand so
might<00:01:52.049> sound<00:01:52.290> funny<00:01:52.470> but<00:01:52.799> again<00:01:53.159> this<00:01:53.310> is

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
might sound funny but again this is

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:15.190 
might sound funny but again this is
proof<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.850> concept

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.860 

so<00:02:16.550> yeah<00:02:17.550> I<00:02:17.790> need<00:02:17.970> to<00:02:18.000> get<00:02:18.180> some<00:02:18.330> more<00:02:18.420> foam<00:02:18.690> in

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
so yeah I need to get some more foam in

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.780 
so yeah I need to get some more foam in
