00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:48.249 
surprising amount of confidence oozing a

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:51.149

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
better look see it sort of gone more

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.500

like<00:04:05.690> a<00:04:05.870> gravy<00:04:06.489> so<00:04:07.489> now<00:04:07.730> I'm<00:04:07.880> gonna<00:04:08.000> turn<00:04:08.300> the

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
like a gravy so now I'm gonna turn the

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.570 
like a gravy so now I'm gonna turn the
heat<00:04:08.540> off<00:04:11.470> it's<00:04:12.470> really<00:04:12.739> important<00:04:13.190> that<00:04:13.220> you

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
heat off it's really important that you

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:23.680 
heat off it's really important that you
do<00:04:19.720> basically<00:04:20.720> this<00:04:21.350> stuff<00:04:21.709> because<00:04:22.639> I<00:04:22.970> think

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
do basically this stuff because I think

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.719 
do basically this stuff because I think
this<00:04:23.900> is<00:04:24.050> a<00:04:24.080> reason<00:04:24.440> because<00:04:24.560> it's<00:04:24.919> low<00:04:25.280> in<00:04:25.430> fat

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
this is a reason because it's low in fat

00:04:25.729 --> 00:05:37.210 
this is a reason because it's low in fat
it's

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:06:05.810 

-<00:06:02.030> because<00:06:03.030> the<00:06:03.930> oxide<00:06:04.530> cubes<00:06:04.830> will<00:06:05.070> be<00:06:05.580> quite

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820 
- because the oxide cubes will be quite

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:15.800 
- because the oxide cubes will be quite
salty<00:06:06.120> and<00:06:06.510> even<00:06:06.960> more<00:06:07.140> so<00:06:07.350> after<00:06:07.460> reduce<00:06:14.810> and

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:15.810 
salty and even more so after reduce and

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.110 
salty and even more so after reduce and
there<00:06:16.110> we<00:06:16.229> have<00:06:16.380> it<00:06:16.410> a<00:06:16.889> nice<00:06:17.190> creamy<00:06:17.790> pasta

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120
