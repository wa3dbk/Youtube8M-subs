00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 hall youtube and welcome to one 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.730
 new technique sloth video 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.799
 Today there is a long-term report 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.500
 to the end of rain design 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.420
 this is such a stand for your notebook 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.790
 the presentation is clear 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.820
 the direction macbook of apple and her 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.490
 just see a true 13 inch macbook 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.100
 air from you from the year 2011 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.980
 that I've been around for about a minute now 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.490
 year together with the emsland at home 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.740
 in addition to the external monitor always use 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.460
 I have the external monitor that is 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.329
 a 720 counter from acer something to the side 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.430
 pushed 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.960
 because the camera starts here 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.090
 slight flicker 1 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.620
 that irritates I move now times the 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.660
 Camera do not scare there you see 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.850
 now that's flickering around that 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.520
 size ratio to show 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.260
 between the 27-inch monitor now he gets 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.329
 the full booming flicker but that is 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.030
 as I said only on the camera to see 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.879
 not with the normal eye and experience 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.590
 then really and small 13 counter too 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.809
 home, of course, just as 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.770
 Supplement monitor will then the macbook 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.900
 used by me to stop programs 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.320
 status message twitter a video or something 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.130
 always 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.710
 In addition to show I am very 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.000
 very satisfied with the stand 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.009
 I honestly say the thing I have 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.009
 At that time I think for 50 euros shot 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.770
 current Amazon price is 58 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.950
 and I would buy it again anytime 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.439
 quite honest i like the presentation 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.079
 i like the design very clearly it is 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.880
 naturally desk for an apple 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.829
 even if you are not really 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.259
 on it stands I think just of the design 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.439
 but appealing I take a macbook 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.920
 Just down and then you go 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.140
 right now I have the monitor 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.360
 cables behind it just fold something 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.399
 too we are here still the hdmi cable 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.350
 Just fly around and ignore it 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.090
 then we have the poorest on the 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.860
 foot underneath then I have the 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.200
 external an external hard drive 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.700
 I could do that too 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.409
 actually from the cable you see here 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.060
 behind the opening I could 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.350
 actually the USB cable still through 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.690
 push and then back around at the 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.479
 side so i do not have any cables in front 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.930
 boost've 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.459
 but I do not really use the emster 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.040
 I do not have much to do with the design 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.659
 explain so sees the thing looks 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.610
 nice but has the disadvantage it is 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:23.110
 you can change the angle again 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.670
 where I have to say why should 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.409
 you want to change the angle with the 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.910
 keyboard from the notebook you type there 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:30.250
 certainly not on top if the box 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.620
 stands on it and around the monitor angle too 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.660
 change well here comes the notebook 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.900
 can you change the angle as well 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.760
 that bothers less for many more 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.069
 problem that the thing does not hear 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.230
 is adjustable if it means you too 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.970
 Low is something that just needs to know 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.769
 I bake a phone book two underneath 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.560
 it looks natural from 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:54.250
 design technically not so nice 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.349
 The thing has so little rubber feet with it 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.569
 not the poorest scratched and also 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:00.790
 not your macbook or other 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.890
 notebook and here in front again two 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.569
 mounts so nothing slides down 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.030
 and now I'm ready for a good ten 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:09.370
 months in duration use to say I 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.049
 The thing is true after 1000 times up 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.970
 and packed again and again 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.950
 I have it on my macbook 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.930
 no scratches get here are none 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.910
 corners did not come down here either 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.540
 again rubbers apple tuned 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.459
 At first I was a bit afraid that 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.799
 my macbook was always nice too 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.060
 reasonable on it you have to stop 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.010
 just watch that you put the thing on the 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.359
 get on well here and not 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.069
 over it then it starts slowly 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:36.190
 but to slip even then slips it 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:38.079
 I do not have to go down that was mine 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.120
 main criticism or not critical point 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:42.160
 but my main fear point is me 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.349
 because possibly the macbook scratched with 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.269
 if I know something like that, I know in the morning 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:48.069
 entrepreneur in the evening pack again 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.910
 and such games are no good 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.700
 fear 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.500
 I am really with the product 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.299
 satisfied that fits everything with me 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.060
 Of course you want or you can 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.739
 say it would be cheaper 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.079
 I was not in question at all for me 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.120
 then for the 50 euro super too 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:06.069
 I am still happy and happy 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.489
 happy after I know you twice 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:12.730
 Doubled up that I feel that way 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.049
 I would and would do it again 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.519
 buy again so if I have one 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.799
 product has where I really so happy 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:19.840
 I do not have to be that too 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.350
 out and now here next to again 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.330
 the 27 counter 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.810
 yes there is the size difference above 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.100
 recognize it with a 24 inch watch 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.690
 already different from the close 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.290
 usually also with the top 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:36.110
 the height then nice off so that it should 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.920
 its actually been having a bit longer 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.020
 lasted 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.700
 I noticed recently that 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.520
 I never among the poorest ones 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.140
 wrote the final report that was 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.490
 Thank you very much for watching it 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.490
 good and see you next video
