Cooper fault or as in this case we are

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.460 
Cooper fault or as in this case we are
using<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.769> seedbed<00:00:29.130> for<00:00:29.340> type<00:00:29.760> design<00:00:30.570> long

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
using a seedbed for type design long

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.090 
using a seedbed for type design long
time<00:00:31.800> ago<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:32.550> let's<00:00:32.759> see<00:00:33.090> how<00:00:34.100> any

can add so root as in this case we use

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.430 
can add so root as in this case we use
strawberry<00:00:50.940> then<00:00:51.329> another<00:00:51.570> ingredient<00:00:51.930> very

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
strawberry then another ingredient very

strawberry then another ingredient very
important<00:00:52.980> which<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.129> not<00:00:53.460> an<00:00:53.610> ingredient<00:00:53.850> is

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
important which is not an ingredient is

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.889 
important which is not an ingredient is
that<00:00:54.570> loser<00:00:55.610> Cooper<00:00:56.610> or<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.789> silver<00:00:57.270> pot<00:00:57.480> as<00:00:57.750> in

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
that loser Cooper or a silver pot as in

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.819 
that loser Cooper or a silver pot as in
this<00:00:58.140> case<00:00:58.379> so<00:00:59.309> let's<00:00:59.870> move<00:01:00.870> in<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.320> kitchen

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
this case so let's move in the kitchen

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.950 
this case so let's move in the kitchen
and<00:01:02.160> see<00:01:02.850> how<00:01:03.300> we<00:01:03.570> can<00:01:03.809> do<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:05.479> well<00:01:06.510> again

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
and see how we can do this well again

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.530 
and see how we can do this well again
the<00:01:07.830> most<00:01:08.040> important<00:01:08.700> thing<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.390> find<00:01:11.540> good

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
the most important thing is to find good

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.789 
the most important thing is to find good
good<00:01:14.299> Cooper<00:01:15.299> or<00:01:15.570> silver<00:01:16.020> pot<00:01:16.290> as<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.650> is

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
good Cooper or silver pot as it is

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.710 
good Cooper or silver pot as it is
change<00:01:18.290> this<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.560> because<00:01:20.040> if<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:21.000> get<00:01:21.420> used

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
change this is because if you get used

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.050 
change this is because if you get used
to<00:01:21.869> use<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:22.409> pot<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:23.009> can<00:01:23.220> do<00:01:23.400> there's<00:01:23.939> a

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
to use this pot you can do there's a

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.749 
to use this pot you can do there's a
very<00:01:24.240> only<00:01:24.600> order<00:01:24.960> other<00:01:25.560> things<00:01:26.040> very<00:01:26.280> easily

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
very only order other things very easily

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.999 
very only order other things very easily
just<00:01:27.560> taking<00:01:28.850> five<00:01:29.850> six<00:01:30.450> minutes<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.320> do<00:01:31.890> it

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
just taking five six minutes and do it

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.560 
just taking five six minutes and do it
straight<00:01:32.340> away<00:01:32.670> on<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:33.000> fire

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
straight away on the fire

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.039 
straight away on the fire
otherwise<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.470> should<00:01:34.740> use<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:36.150> band<00:01:36.810> money

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
otherwise you should use a band money

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.520 
otherwise you should use a band money
which<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.920> will<00:01:38.189> takes<00:01:38.520> longer<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:39.720> let's<00:01:40.320> get

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
which it will takes longer so let's get

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.690 
which it will takes longer so let's get
a<00:01:40.770> very<00:01:41.700> good<00:01:42.259> Cooper<00:01:43.259> pot<00:01:43.560> or<00:01:43.860> silver<00:01:44.430> water

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
a very good Cooper pot or silver water

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.690 
a very good Cooper pot or silver water
and<00:01:45.030> let's<00:01:45.509> start<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.990> exercise<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:47.490> first

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
and let's start to exercise the first

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.330 
and let's start to exercise the first
time<00:01:47.970> we<00:01:48.119> have<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.479> be<00:01:48.630> careful<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.350> use<00:01:49.950> very

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
time we have to be careful and use very

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.280 
time we have to be careful and use very
low<00:01:50.970> beating<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.780> then<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:53.520> can<00:01:54.149> be<00:01:54.659> faster

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
low beating and then you can be faster

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.130 
low beating and then you can be faster
the<00:01:55.470> next<00:01:55.619> time<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.460> let's<00:01:57.000> start<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.450> put<00:01:57.479> all

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
the next time so let's start to put all

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.730 
the next time so let's start to put all
the<00:01:58.680> ingredients<00:01:59.610> together<00:02:00.299> in<00:02:01.159> inside<00:02:02.159> this

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
the ingredients together in inside this

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.980 
the ingredients together in inside this
silver<00:02:04.740> pot<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.490> then<00:02:06.149> we<00:02:06.450> will<00:02:06.659> start<00:02:06.899> to

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
silver pot and then we will start to

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.949 
silver pot and then we will start to
whisk<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.560> on<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.860> fire<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.489> very<00:02:09.149> slowly<00:02:09.569> and

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
whisk it on the fire and very slowly and

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.190 
whisk it on the fire and very slowly and
as<00:02:10.410> you

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
as you

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.580 
as you
we'll<00:02:11.560> see<00:02:11.890> it<00:02:12.280> will<00:02:12.640> whisk<00:02:13.300> in<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.750> same<00:02:14.290> time

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
we'll see it will whisk in the same time

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.839 
we'll see it will whisk in the same time
the<00:02:14.920> egg<00:02:15.099> yolk<00:02:15.370> will<00:02:16.030> will<00:02:16.650> will<00:02:17.650> cook<00:02:17.920> we

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
the egg yolk will will will cook we

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.710 
the egg yolk will will will cook we
cooked<00:02:19.090> it<00:02:19.300> and<00:02:19.680> but<00:02:20.680> we<00:02:20.890> are<00:02:21.010> not<00:02:21.190> going<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.450> do

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
cooked it and but we are not going to do

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.530 
cooked it and but we are not going to do
it<00:02:22.750> too<00:02:23.440> strongly<00:02:23.770> otherwise<00:02:24.370> it<00:02:25.060> would<00:02:25.330> be

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
it too strongly otherwise it would be

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.990 
it too strongly otherwise it would be
more<00:02:26.260> like<00:02:26.610> scrambled<00:02:27.610> eggs

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
more like scrambled eggs

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.630 
more like scrambled eggs
so<00:02:28.150> sugar<00:02:29.280> 4<00:02:30.280> egg<00:02:30.580> yolks<00:02:31.590> some<00:02:32.590> white<00:02:33.340> wine

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
so sugar 4 egg yolks some white wine

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
as Marsala for example but this is very

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:59.490 
as Marsala for example but this is very
light<00:03:21.130> is<00:03:21.340> very<00:03:21.579> interesting<00:03:57.630> so<00:03:58.630> you<00:03:58.690> see<00:03:59.260> is

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500

getting thicker and thicker and this

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.440 
getting thicker and thicker and this
point<00:04:04.329> I<00:04:04.510> would<00:04:04.780> say<00:04:04.959> is<00:04:05.260> is<00:04:05.799> nearly<00:04:06.220> ready<00:04:06.579> and

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
point I would say is is nearly ready and

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.449 
point I would say is is nearly ready and
depends<00:04:08.019> if<00:04:08.290> you<00:04:08.530> have<00:04:08.560> to<00:04:08.799> grating<00:04:09.160> it<00:04:09.280> is

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
depends if you have to grating it is

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.270 
depends if you have to grating it is
better<00:04:09.670> to<00:04:09.880> cook<00:04:10.359> it<00:04:10.540> a<00:04:10.690> bit<00:04:10.720> more<00:04:11.170> and<00:04:11.590> get<00:04:12.040> it

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
better to cook it a bit more and get it

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.250 
better to cook it a bit more and get it
bit<00:04:12.579> more<00:04:12.790> thick<00:04:13.030> so<00:04:13.269> if<00:04:13.510> you<00:04:13.720> put<00:04:13.900> the<00:04:14.019> fruit

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
bit more thick so if you put the fruit

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.140 
bit more thick so if you put the fruit
on<00:04:14.440> top<00:04:14.470> the<00:04:15.100> fruit<00:04:15.310> will<00:04:15.519> stand<00:04:15.910> on<00:04:16.180> it<00:04:16.660> will

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
on top the fruit will stand on it will

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.090 
on top the fruit will stand on it will
come<00:04:19.150> to<00:04:19.330> fall<00:04:19.599> down

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
come to fall down

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.330 
come to fall down
