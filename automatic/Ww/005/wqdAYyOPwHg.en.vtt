 there 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.450
 these guys this new video a 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.120
 new tutorial we will do today and to do 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.520
 williams a very little outgoing song 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.000
 long ago I believe a maximum of two years ago 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.650
 a year and a half ago and has so many 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.390
 views on youtube has become 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.790
 very famous or more catchphrase 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.050
 of the summer the winter a torment in 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.910
 general 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.770
 let's go immediately to learn it for whom 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.570
 want then it is not difficult is not so much 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.790
 difficult but it takes enough 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.920
 mastery in the sense that we immediately see the 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.920
 initial part then the partition 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:26.380
 the greater me the greater 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.610
 yes greater the greater 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.000
 and me major 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.000
 ok 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:38.430
 practically we start with mine 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:41.900
 greater than we know so far 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.480
 ok the major how it is formed 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.460
 first finger on the first key of the third 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.070
 rope wounded on the second stretch 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.510
 of the A4 door 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.880
 second finger on century rates 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.840
 fifth string 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.590
 no 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:00.509
 what we do from here we make gods 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.509
 beats that will be in our triplets 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.580
 we will do this her 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:22.140
 this will be our ok time then what 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.060
 let's make 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.270
 images me major 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.380
 greater 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:31.400
 and yes greater in line or volumes 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.400
 with this writing 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:44.209
 hence the greater how it is formed 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.190
 first second third elite actually 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.310
 on the fourth third second string that 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.370
 according to taxes 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.180
 then we have the major yes then the tav 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.709
 it would be this 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.659
 however it is very difficult for i 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.709
 beginners therefore do not prepare a 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:04.200
 sort of power chords open in 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:06.030
 feelings of this agreement the first 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.739
 finger on the second rate of the fifth 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:13.409
 string the third finger on the fourth fret 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.659
 of the fourth heart and what it says on 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:17.219
 fourth key of the third string then 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.430
 it will come out so unfortunate what it must 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:19.430
 happen 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.019
 Yup 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.430
 all right 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.800
 then we move on to the refrain we have a 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.270
 seventh plus 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.270
 ok then the position of the C major 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:44.790
 that is this we are simply 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.790
 we remove the first I say ok 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.310
 si minor similar to the seventh 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.140
 san g 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.410
 increased four times 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.940
 no hear but more minor me as i am 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.190
 remained minor 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.730
 this is the plate we can manage 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:07.879
 make the gentleman easier 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.890
 she would be this thing to us 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:11.420
 we carry the first ritual that it would be 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.970
 the bar well on if you brought the first one 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.350
 rope 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.350
 so what 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.130
 ok you if you could principiando 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.860
 also avoid doing 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.020
 yes minor seventh you can stay on 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:33.870
 less ease is not enough if me 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.870
 major then original 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.180
 b 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:43.599
 instead you can do it a version 

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:43.599
 facilitated 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.170
 Yup 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.750
 Well 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.750
 and then it starts again 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:11.819
 the boys the video is finished 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:18.240
 I remember to register in the comments and 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:20.219
 on facebook because they are founded racist and 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.030
 see you in the next ontario 

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:23.030
 beautiful
