00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
Justice League movie by like 2019 I

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.130 
Justice League movie by like 2019 I
think<00:00:47.969> that's<00:00:48.300> exactly<00:00:48.510> what<00:00:48.899> they're

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
think that's exactly what they're

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.479 
think that's exactly what they're
building<00:00:49.320> up<00:00:49.530> towards<00:00:49.890> right<00:00:50.190> now<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.340> think

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
building up towards right now I think

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.920 
building up towards right now I think
that's<00:00:50.730> why<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:50.940> have<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.239> Batman<00:00:51.660> vs.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
that's why you have a Batman vs.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.069 
that's why you have a Batman vs.
Superman<00:00:51.960> movie<00:00:52.500> even<00:00:53.489> though<00:00:53.699> I'm<00:00:54.420> more<00:00:54.809> into

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
need to have something that's really

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.310 
need to have something that's really
going<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.150> differentiate<00:01:42.810> him<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.140> make<00:01:43.229> him

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
going to differentiate him and make him

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.569 
going to differentiate him and make him
stand<00:01:43.500> above<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.770> rest<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.250> think<00:01:44.460> making

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
stand above the rest and I think making

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:45.649 
stand above the rest and I think making
him<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.909> leader<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.329> Justice<00:01:45.600> League

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
him the leader of the Justice League

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.620 
him the leader of the Justice League
makes<00:01:45.930> sense<00:01:46.110> my<00:01:47.070> mind<00:01:47.670> has<00:01:47.850> changed<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.540> little

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
makes sense my mind has changed a little

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.240 
makes sense my mind has changed a little
bit<00:01:48.810> recently<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.290> now<00:01:49.619> kind<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:49.979> think<00:01:50.130> that

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
bit recently I now kind of think that

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.380 
bit recently I now kind of think that
they<00:01:50.520> might<00:01:50.640> set<00:01:50.850> up<00:01:50.880> Batman<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.299> Superman

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
they might set up Batman and Superman

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.850 
they might set up Batman and Superman
establishing<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.290> Justice<00:01:52.560> League<00:01:52.740> together

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
establishing the Justice League together

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.130 
establishing the Justice League together
and<00:01:53.430> maybe<00:01:53.939> they<00:01:54.270> kind<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.479> like<00:01:54.630> co-lead<00:01:55.020> it

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
and maybe they kind of like co-lead it

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.039 
and maybe they kind of like co-lead it
you<00:01:55.229> have<00:01:55.380> more<00:01:56.090> the<00:01:57.090> let's<00:01:57.450> face<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.659> Superman

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
you have more the let's face it Superman

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.530 
you have more the let's face it Superman
and<00:01:58.140> Batman<00:01:58.170> are<00:01:58.710> two<00:01:59.579> very<00:02:00.000> different<00:02:00.210> sides

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
and Batman are two very different sides

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.780 
and Batman are two very different sides
of<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:00.960> same<00:02:01.049> coin<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:02.340> think<00:02:02.610> maybe

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
of the same coin and I think maybe

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.910 
of the same coin and I think maybe
setting<00:02:03.180> them<00:02:03.299> up<00:02:03.509> as<00:02:03.780> like<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.200> dual<00:02:04.439> leaders

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
setting them up as like the dual leaders

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.109 
setting them up as like the dual leaders
of<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.100> Justice<00:02:05.399> League<00:02:05.460> makes<00:02:05.850> sense

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
of the Justice League makes sense

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.969 
of the Justice League makes sense
because<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.479> their<00:02:06.689> differences<00:02:07.170> but<00:02:07.799> that's

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
because of their differences but that's

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.070 
because of their differences but that's
just<00:02:08.069> my<00:02:08.250> thought<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:08.789> would<00:02:09.509> love<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.929> see

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
just my thought I would love to see

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.170 
just my thought I would love to see
Batman<00:02:10.410> as<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.830> leader<00:02:11.069> I<00:02:11.370> think<00:02:11.670> it's<00:02:11.970> either

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
Batman as the leader I think it's either

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.250 
Batman as the leader I think it's either
going<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.420> be<00:02:12.510> that<00:02:12.660> or<00:02:12.870> that

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
going to be that or that

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.539 
going to be that or that
them<00:02:13.470> leading<00:02:13.650> together<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.220> that's<00:02:14.340> just<00:02:14.459> my

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
them leading together and that's just my

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:16.850 
them leading together and that's just my
thought<00:02:14.730> Shep<00:02:15.030> what<00:02:15.150> do<00:02:15.209> you<00:02:15.269> think<00:02:15.709> well<00:02:16.709> when

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
thought Shep what do you think well when

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.619
