so<00:04:44.520> the<00:04:44.700> ethical<00:04:45.150> questions<00:04:45.600> raised<00:04:45.900> by<00:04:46.050> these

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
so the ethical questions raised by these

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.320 
so the ethical questions raised by these
technologies<00:04:46.950> are<00:04:47.220> ones<00:04:47.490> we<00:04:47.700> will<00:04:47.790> all<00:04:48.030> have

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
technologies are ones we will all have

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.230 
technologies are ones we will all have
to<00:04:48.450> face<00:04:48.630> soon<00:04:49.520> analysis<00:04:50.520> in<00:04:50.700> consideration

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
to face soon analysis in consideration

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.680 
to face soon analysis in consideration
of<00:04:51.570> these<00:04:51.720> ethical<00:04:52.170> issues<00:04:52.320> is<00:04:53.130> really

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
of these ethical issues is really

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.870 
of these ethical issues is really
playing<00:04:54.690> catch-up<00:04:55.020> to<00:04:55.500> the<00:04:55.880> technologies

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
playing catch-up to the technologies

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.360 
playing catch-up to the technologies
themselves<00:04:57.090> these<00:04:57.960> human<00:04:58.440> enhancements<00:04:59.100> can

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
themselves these human enhancements can

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.450 
themselves these human enhancements can
they<00:04:59.550> be<00:04:59.610> reversed<00:05:00.300> yes<00:05:01.020> or<00:05:01.200> no<00:05:01.470> so<00:05:02.010> it's<00:05:02.220> one

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
they be reversed yes or no so it's one

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.130 
they be reversed yes or no so it's one
thing<00:05:02.490> if<00:05:02.880> you're<00:05:02.910> taking<00:05:03.360> a<00:05:03.450> drug<00:05:03.750> like<00:05:03.960> an

thing if you're taking a drug like an

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.800 
thing if you're taking a drug like an

we<00:05:18.750> can't<00:05:19.140> wait<00:05:19.530> for<00:05:19.560> these<00:05:19.980> technologies<00:05:20.940> to

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
we can't wait for these technologies to

we can't wait for these technologies to
be<00:05:21.300> just<00:05:21.540> dumped<00:05:21.900> in<00:05:21.990> our<00:05:22.110> lap<00:05:22.380> what<00:05:23.010> you<00:05:23.130> have

be just dumped in our lap what you have

be just dumped in our lap what you have
to<00:05:23.640> do<00:05:23.790> is<00:05:24.000> start<00:05:24.570> figuring<00:05:25.140> out<00:05:25.500> what<00:05:25.980> we

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
to do is start figuring out what we

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.780 
to do is start figuring out what we
