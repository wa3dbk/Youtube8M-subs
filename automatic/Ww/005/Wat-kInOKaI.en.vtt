00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
them new shoots who are developed so

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.360 
them new shoots who are developed so
this<00:03:46.209> is<00:03:46.389> a<00:03:46.419> grass<00:03:46.780> if<00:03:47.319> you<00:03:47.500> cut<00:03:47.739> a<00:03:47.769> fruit<00:03:48.099> tree

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
this is a grass if you cut a fruit tree

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.629 
this is a grass if you cut a fruit tree
it's<00:03:49.060> dead<00:03:49.449> once<00:03:49.989> you<00:03:50.109> cut<00:03:50.349> the<00:03:51.010> apple<00:03:51.430> tree

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:51.639 
it's dead once you cut the apple tree

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:52.649 
it's dead once you cut the apple tree

it's gone forever

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:54.839 
it's gone forever
another<00:03:53.139> apple<00:03:53.530> tree<00:03:53.709> won't<00:03:53.949> grow<00:03:54.129> but

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
another apple tree won't grow but

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:56.789 
another apple tree won't grow but
bananas<00:03:55.239> will<00:03:55.720> because<00:03:56.109> these<00:03:56.259> out<00:03:56.470> through

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
bananas will because these out through

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.860 
bananas will because these out through
this<00:03:57.430> is<00:03:57.669> more<00:03:57.939> like<00:03:58.150> if<00:03:58.329> you<00:03:58.419> think<00:03:58.659> of<00:03:58.750> this

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
this is more like if you think of this

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.259 
this is more like if you think of this
as<00:03:59.049> a<00:03:59.079> big<00:03:59.349> grass<00:03:59.709> this<00:04:00.489> would<00:04:00.759> be<00:04:00.849> the<00:04:01.000> flower

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
as a big grass this would be the flower

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.360 
as a big grass this would be the flower
of<00:04:01.509> the<00:04:01.569> grass<00:04:01.599> and<00:04:02.349> this<00:04:02.680> would<00:04:02.859> be<00:04:03.009> like<00:04:03.220> the

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
of the grass and this would be like the

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.830 
of the grass and this would be like the
little<00:04:03.519> seedlings<00:04:04.180> that<00:04:04.449> happen<00:04:04.780> on<00:04:04.900> a<00:04:04.930> grass

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
little seedlings that happen on a grass

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.339 
little seedlings that happen on a grass
example<00:04:07.840> this<00:04:08.439> would<00:04:08.680> be<00:04:09.209> this<00:04:10.209> would<00:04:10.449> be<00:04:10.509> the

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.349 
example this would be this would be the

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:13.409 
example this would be this would be the
leaves<00:04:11.560> would<00:04:12.159> be<00:04:12.310> similar<00:04:12.879> to<00:04:12.909> the<00:04:13.180> leaves

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:13.419 
leaves would be similar to the leaves

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:18.270 
leaves would be similar to the leaves
there's<00:04:14.259> the<00:04:14.530> flower<00:04:14.829> and<00:04:15.310> then<00:04:16.209> the<00:04:16.359> seeds<00:04:17.280> so

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
there's the flower and then the seeds so

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.490 
there's the flower and then the seeds so
that's

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.910 

from<00:04:23.160> earth<00:04:23.370> rose<00:04:23.700> farm

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:34.290 

I<00:04:30.360> always<00:04:31.360> walk

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.980 

now<00:04:35.300> the<00:04:35.360> GPS<00:04:35.899> is<00:04:36.050> telling<00:04:36.080> us<00:04:36.409> make<00:04:37.309> a<00:04:37.339> u-turn

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
now the GPS is telling us make a u-turn

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.899 
now the GPS is telling us make a u-turn
Yeah<00:04:38.990> right<00:04:39.319> just<00:04:39.949> goes<00:04:40.159> to<00:04:40.339> show<00:04:40.520> you<00:04:40.580> how<00:04:40.879> a

Yeah right just goes to show you how a

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:42.730 
Yeah right just goes to show you how a
GPS<00:04:41.419> is<00:04:41.629> you<00:04:42.169> don't<00:04:42.349> know<00:04:42.469> what<00:04:42.589> they're

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740
