clearance<00:05:29.600> $40<00:05:30.260> I<00:05:30.410> think<00:05:30.590> I<00:05:30.650> paid<00:05:30.860> less<00:05:31.070> than

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
clearance $40 I think I paid less than

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.630 
clearance $40 I think I paid less than
that<00:05:31.430> for<00:05:31.760> it<00:05:31.910> but<00:05:32.260> they<00:05:33.260> still<00:05:33.530> even<00:05:33.980> at<00:05:34.190> 40<00:05:34.610> I

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:34.640 
that for it but they still even at 40 I

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.540 
that for it but they still even at 40 I
think<00:05:34.730> it's<00:05:35.090> kind<00:05:35.360> of<00:05:35.390> expensive<00:05:36.340> but<00:05:37.340> it<00:05:37.400> does

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
think it's kind of expensive but it does

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.130 
think it's kind of expensive but it does
have<00:05:37.730> four<00:05:37.760> hundred<00:05:38.180> and<00:05:38.270> sixty-five<00:05:38.630> pieces

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.140 
have four hundred and sixty-five pieces

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.680 
have four hundred and sixty-five pieces
so<00:05:39.410> I<00:05:39.680> guess<00:05:39.919> 45<00:05:40.610> to<00:05:40.850> 50<00:05:41.090> dollars<00:05:41.360> we<00:05:41.480> have<00:05:41.570> been

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
so I guess 45 to 50 dollars we have been

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.050 
so I guess 45 to 50 dollars we have been
a<00:05:41.720> better<00:05:41.870> price<00:05:42.200> I<00:05:43.360> don't<00:05:44.360> know<00:05:44.510> it's<00:05:44.720> just
