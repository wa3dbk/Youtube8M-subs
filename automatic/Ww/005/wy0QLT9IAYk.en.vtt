following the series i've made a lot of

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.460 
following the series i've made a lot of
maple<00:00:11.700> syrup<00:00:12.059> this<00:00:12.480> year<00:00:12.780> and<00:00:12.990> i<00:00:13.080> made<00:00:13.260> a<00:00:13.290> lot

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:13.470 
maple syrup this year and i made a lot

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.089 
maple syrup this year and i made a lot
of<00:00:13.500> boxelder<00:00:13.980> syrup<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:15.260> now<00:00:16.260> that<00:00:16.470> season<00:00:16.980> is

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:17.099 
of boxelder syrup and now that season is

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:19.700 
of boxelder syrup and now that season is
kind<00:00:17.340> of<00:00:17.430> starting<00:00:17.700> to<00:00:17.790> wind<00:00:18.000> down<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.710> the

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
kind of starting to wind down and the

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.710 
kind of starting to wind down and the
birch<00:00:19.890> season<00:00:20.310> is<00:00:20.430> just<00:00:20.730> starting<00:00:21.210> normally

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
birch season is just starting normally

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.720 
birch season is just starting normally
the<00:00:21.869> birch<00:00:22.050> trees<00:00:22.440> will<00:00:22.800> start<00:00:23.160> running<00:00:23.340> sap

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
the birch trees will start running sap

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.700 
the birch trees will start running sap
about<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.390> time<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.750> maples<00:00:25.080> get<00:00:25.289> done<00:00:25.500> or

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
about the time the maples get done or

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.830 
about the time the maples get done or
start<00:00:25.920> getting<00:00:26.190> the<00:00:26.310> buddy<00:00:26.520> flavor<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.750> them

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
start getting the buddy flavor to them

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.330 
start getting the buddy flavor to them
and<00:00:28.020> I<00:00:28.050> start<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.380> bud<00:00:28.560> out<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.949> it's<00:00:29.039> not<00:00:29.190> as

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
and I start to bud out and it's not as

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.099 
and I start to bud out and it's not as
good<00:00:29.520> anymore<00:00:29.550> but<00:00:30.420> it's<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.630> little<00:00:30.840> bit<00:00:30.930> of<00:00:31.020> a

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
good anymore but it's a little bit of a

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.840 
good anymore but it's a little bit of a
different<00:00:31.380> process<00:00:31.470> making<00:00:32.040> this<00:00:32.309> syrup<00:00:32.669> than

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
different process making this syrup than

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.530 
different process making this syrup than
it<00:00:32.970> is<00:00:33.090> making<00:00:33.449> the<00:00:33.570> others<00:00:38.210> when<00:00:39.210> we<00:00:39.360> make

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
it is making the others when we make

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.270 
it is making the others when we make
maple<00:00:40.020> syrup<00:00:40.410> we're<00:00:40.920> talking<00:00:41.370> forty<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.149> one

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
maple syrup we're talking forty to one

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.889 
maple syrup we're talking forty to one
ratio<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.520> forty<00:00:44.880> gallons<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.300> water<00:00:45.450> equals

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
ratio so forty gallons of water equals

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.200 
ratio so forty gallons of water equals
one<00:00:46.140> gallon<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:46.620> syrup<00:00:46.829> roughly<00:00:47.460> when<00:00:47.969> we<00:00:48.059> did

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
one gallon of syrup roughly when we did

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.540 
one gallon of syrup roughly when we did
the<00:00:48.300> boxelder<00:00:48.750> we<00:00:48.989> were<00:00:49.110> at<00:00:49.260> sixty<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.860> one<00:00:49.890> but

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
the boxelder we were at sixty to one but

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.979 
the boxelder we were at sixty to one but
when<00:00:50.640> we<00:00:50.730> run<00:00:50.910> up<00:00:50.940> into<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.390> birch<00:00:51.600> we're<00:00:51.899> up

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
when we run up into the birch we're up

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.229 
when we run up into the birch we're up
to<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.200> hundred<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.710> one<00:00:53.040> and<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.850> makes<00:00:54.090> it

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
to a hundred and one and that makes it

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.660 
to a hundred and one and that makes it
real<00:00:54.559> labor-intensive<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:56.190> just<00:00:56.370> really

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
real labor-intensive and you just really

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.369 
real labor-intensive and you just really
can't<00:00:56.910> find<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.329> much<00:00:57.510> birch<00:00:57.780> syrup<00:00:58.020> around

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
can't find that much birch syrup around

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.400 
can't find that much birch syrup around
to<00:00:58.500> buy<00:00:58.680> ah<00:00:59.270> but<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.539> really<00:01:00.870> want<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.170> know<00:01:01.230> how

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
to buy ah but I really want to know how

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.740 
to buy ah but I really want to know how
to<00:01:01.469> do<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:01.890> well<00:01:02.160> because<00:01:02.430> if<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.210> was<00:01:03.390> living

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
to do this well because if I was living

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.010 
to do this well because if I was living
up<00:01:03.870> at<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.830> tent<00:01:05.450> there's<00:01:06.450> not<00:01:06.600> gonna<00:01:06.690> be<00:01:06.780> any

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
up at the tent there's not gonna be any

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.359 
up at the tent there's not gonna be any
boxelder<00:01:07.440> trees<00:01:07.770> there's<00:01:07.979> not<00:01:08.130> going<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.310> be

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
boxelder trees there's not going to be

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.240 
boxelder trees there's not going to be
any<00:01:08.640> maple<00:01:09.420> trees<00:01:09.840> but<00:01:10.200> there<00:01:10.649> are<00:01:10.890> literally

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
any maple trees but there are literally

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.650 
any maple trees but there are literally
thousands<00:01:11.910> and<00:01:12.060> thousands<00:01:12.509> of<00:01:12.569> birch<00:01:12.780> trees

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
thousands and thousands of birch trees

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.930 
thousands and thousands of birch trees
the<00:01:15.660> difference<00:01:16.050> in<00:01:16.289> the<00:01:16.530> types<00:01:17.160> of<00:01:17.340> syrup<00:01:17.700> is

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
the difference in the types of syrup is

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.820 
the difference in the types of syrup is
with<00:01:18.179> the<00:01:18.330> boxelder<00:01:18.810> or<00:01:19.050> the<00:01:19.170> maple<00:01:19.500> which<00:01:19.649> are

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
with the boxelder or the maple which are

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.309 
with the boxelder or the maple which are
in<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.069> same<00:01:20.280> maple<00:01:20.700> family<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.690> main<00:01:21.929> sugar

00:01:22.309 --> 00:01:22.319 
in the same maple family the main sugar

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:26.660 
in the same maple family the main sugar
in<00:01:22.679> that<00:01:23.099> syrup<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.910> sucrose<00:01:25.250> when<00:01:26.250> we<00:01:26.340> come<00:01:26.520> to

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
in that syrup is sucrose when we come to

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.240 
in that syrup is sucrose when we come to
the<00:01:26.759> birch<00:01:27.000> now<00:01:27.270> it's<00:01:27.690> fructose<00:01:28.289> which<00:01:29.009> is

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
the birch now it's fructose which is

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.919 
the birch now it's fructose which is
completely<00:01:29.819> different<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.509> kind<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.869> a

00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:30.929 
completely different this kind of a

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:33.589 
completely different this kind of a
syrup<00:01:31.289> would<00:01:31.619> be<00:01:31.830> good<00:01:32.179> for<00:01:33.179> somebody<00:01:33.390> with

00:01:33.589 --> 00:01:33.599 
syrup would be good for somebody with

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:35.059 
syrup would be good for somebody with
diabetes<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.289> there<00:01:34.410> something<00:01:34.709> like<00:01:34.830> that

00:01:35.059 --> 00:01:35.069 
diabetes is there something like that

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.960 
diabetes is there something like that
because<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.429> sugar<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.819> completely

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
because the sugar is completely

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.180 
because the sugar is completely
different<00:01:36.660> the<00:01:37.140> problem<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:37.679> this<00:01:37.920> stuff

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
different the problem is this stuff

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.999 
different the problem is this stuff
burns<00:01:38.550> real<00:01:38.970> easy<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:39.569> with<00:01:40.140> when<00:01:40.440> I<00:01:40.530> do<00:01:40.590> maple

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
burns real easy so with when I do maple

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:41.779 
burns real easy so with when I do maple
in<00:01:41.099> boxelder

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
in boxelder

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:44.210 
in boxelder
I<00:01:41.970> have<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.149> do<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.270> hard<00:01:42.660> boil<00:01:43.050> until<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.950> gets

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
I have to do a hard boil until it gets

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.130 
I have to do a hard boil until it gets
down<00:01:44.429> and<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.789> can<00:01:44.940> watch<00:01:45.149> those<00:01:45.420> bubbles<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.080> I

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
down and I can watch those bubbles and I

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.330 
down and I can watch those bubbles and I
know<00:01:46.200> when<00:01:46.440> it's<00:01:46.590> getting<00:01:46.830> close<00:01:47.039> and<00:01:47.069> I'll

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
know when it's getting close and I'll

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.010 
know when it's getting close and I'll
drop<00:01:47.580> it<00:01:47.789> down<00:01:47.940> so<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.330> doesn't<00:01:48.390> bubble<00:01:48.810> over

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
drop it down so it doesn't bubble over

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.260 
drop it down so it doesn't bubble over
and<00:01:49.319> burn<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:50.310> stuff<00:01:50.459> here<00:01:50.759> we'll<00:01:50.880> take<00:01:51.060> on<00:01:51.239> a

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
and burn this stuff here we'll take on a

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.510 
and burn this stuff here we'll take on a
burnt<00:01:51.599> taste<00:01:51.720> if<00:01:52.410> you're<00:01:52.770> boiling<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.340> just

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
burnt taste if you're boiling it just

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.029 
burnt taste if you're boiling it just
going<00:01:53.700> through<00:01:53.789> the<00:01:54.119> process<00:01:54.500> so<00:01:55.500> what<00:01:55.890> you

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
going through the process so what you

going through the process so what you
have<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.220> do<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.580> more<00:01:56.729> evaporate<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.780> as<00:01:57.869> you

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
have to do is more evaporate and as you

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.139 
have to do is more evaporate and as you
can<00:01:58.140> see<00:01:58.200> here<00:01:58.679> now<00:01:58.800> I've<00:01:58.920> got<00:01:59.069> it<00:01:59.099> just<00:01:59.670> under

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
fact that that hot plate has been abused

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.420 
fact that that hot plate has been abused
smoking<00:02:10.229> stuff<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.619> just<00:02:10.649> doesn't<00:02:11.099> get<00:02:11.160> hot

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
smoking stuff it just doesn't get hot

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.920 
smoking stuff it just doesn't get hot
enough<00:02:11.640> so<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:11.910> just<00:02:12.120> sits<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.480> I'll<00:02:12.540> just<00:02:12.599> turn

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
enough so it just sits it I'll just turn

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.640 
enough so it just sits it I'll just turn
it<00:02:13.019> on<00:02:13.110> in<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.290> morning

let the thing run all day and it'll just

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.830 
let the thing run all day and it'll just
slowly<00:02:16.549> evaporate<00:02:17.549> it<00:02:17.670> away<00:02:17.909> so<00:02:18.540> what<00:02:18.720> we're

gonna<00:02:18.900> do<00:02:19.170> is<00:02:19.319> we're<00:02:19.439> gonna<00:02:19.500> evaporate<00:02:19.920> this

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
gonna do is we're gonna evaporate this

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.940 
gonna do is we're gonna evaporate this

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.259 
here we are a day later and I'm still
just<00:03:22.590> evaporating<00:03:23.340> this<00:03:23.519> real<00:03:23.790> slow<00:03:24.030> I've

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
just evaporating this real slow I've

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.839 
just evaporating this real slow I've
added<00:03:24.540> a<00:03:24.690> bunch<00:03:24.870> to<00:03:25.230> it<00:03:25.379> and<00:03:25.650> just<00:03:26.220> slowly<00:03:26.549> let

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
added a bunch to it and just slowly let

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:38.250 
added a bunch to it and just slowly let
me<00:03:27.060> go<00:03:27.269> down

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260

okay<00:03:39.129> so<00:03:39.190> we're<00:03:39.430> getting<00:03:39.640> to<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:39.879> end<00:03:39.909> of<00:03:40.269> the

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
okay so we're getting to the end of the

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.890 
okay so we're getting to the end of the
birch<00:03:40.629> here<00:03:40.989> I've<00:03:41.319> been<00:03:41.560> doing<00:03:41.860> this<00:03:42.010> for<00:03:42.310> oh

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
birch here I've been doing this for oh

man I don't know three days maybe maybe
four<00:03:46.450> now<00:03:46.629> before<00:03:47.230> one<00:03:47.379> since<00:03:47.620> I<00:03:47.709> started<00:03:47.920> this

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:48.159 
four now before one since I started this

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:50.789 
four now before one since I started this
video<00:03:48.310> but<00:03:49.150> like<00:03:49.360> I<00:03:49.540> never<00:03:49.810> have<00:03:50.319> boiled<00:03:50.680> it

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
video but like I never have boiled it

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.369 
video but like I never have boiled it
yet<00:03:51.010> it's<00:03:51.220> just<00:03:51.310> been<00:03:51.580> real<00:03:51.790> low<00:03:52.379> just

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
yet it's just been real low just

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:55.050 
yet it's just been real low just
evaporating<00:03:54.069> and<00:03:54.159> evaporates<00:03:54.610> about<00:03:54.790> an<00:03:54.879> inch

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
evaporating and evaporates about an inch

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.119 
evaporating and evaporates about an inch
an<00:03:55.209> hour<00:03:55.330> out<00:03:55.599> of<00:03:55.629> this<00:03:55.840> pan<00:03:56.110> but<00:03:56.769> I'm<00:03:56.950> gonna

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
an hour out of this pan but I'm gonna

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:58.650 
an hour out of this pan but I'm gonna
now<00:03:57.310> get<00:03:57.640> it<00:03:57.730> down<00:03:57.910> were<00:03:58.090> at<00:03:58.150> the<00:03:58.239> very<00:03:58.390> end

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
now get it down were at the very end

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.410 
now get it down were at the very end
party<00:03:59.110> or<00:03:59.230> so<00:03:59.500> and<00:04:00.370> I<00:04:00.489> filtered<00:04:00.910> this<00:04:01.030> once<00:04:01.269> in

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
party or so and I filtered this once in

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.630 
party or so and I filtered this once in
the<00:04:01.510> middle<00:04:01.750> to<00:04:01.959> the<00:04:02.230> birch<00:04:02.860> seems<00:04:03.220> to<00:04:03.459> get

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
the middle to the birch seems to get

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.050 
the middle to the birch seems to get
almost<00:04:04.120> a<00:04:04.410> like<00:04:05.410> a<00:04:05.440> city<00:04:05.950> see<00:04:06.549> if<00:04:06.610> you<00:04:06.700> can<00:04:06.849> see

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
almost a like a city see if you can see

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:13.400 
almost a like a city see if you can see
it<00:04:07.150> on<00:04:07.299> here<00:04:10.620> it's<00:04:11.620> a<00:04:11.709> real<00:04:11.890> getting<00:04:12.549> real<00:04:12.730> dark

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
it on here it's a real getting real dark

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.409 
it on here it's a real getting real dark
normally<00:04:14.410> if<00:04:14.530> you<00:04:14.680> did<00:04:14.890> the<00:04:15.220> maple<00:04:15.849> syrup<00:04:16.060> this

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
normally if you did the maple syrup this

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.000 
normally if you did the maple syrup this
would<00:04:16.600> be<00:04:16.750> really<00:04:17.019> sweet<00:04:17.229> by<00:04:17.530> now<00:04:17.709> and<00:04:17.919> this

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
would be really sweet by now and this

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.819 
would be really sweet by now and this
stuff<00:04:18.250> it<00:04:19.030> isn't<00:04:19.299> all<00:04:19.389> that<00:04:19.419> sweet<00:04:19.959> but<00:04:20.289> it's

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
stuff it isn't all that sweet but it's

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.290 
stuff it isn't all that sweet but it's
gonna<00:04:20.979> be<00:04:21.130> very<00:04:21.340> interesting<00:04:21.489> to<00:04:22.060> see<00:04:22.150> how

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
gonna be very interesting to see how

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.020 
gonna be very interesting to see how
this<00:04:22.600> turns<00:04:22.660> out<00:04:23.550> anyway<00:04:24.550> I'm<00:04:24.639> gonna<00:04:24.729> filter

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
this turns out anyway I'm gonna filter

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.600 
this turns out anyway I'm gonna filter
this<00:04:25.330> into<00:04:25.630> this<00:04:25.780> smaller<00:04:26.110> pan<00:04:26.470> and<00:04:27.430> then

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
this into this smaller pan and then

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.210 
this into this smaller pan and then
we'll<00:04:27.789> get<00:04:28.000> this<00:04:28.240> completely<00:04:29.220> evaporated

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
we'll get this completely evaporated

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.480 
we'll get this completely evaporated
down<00:04:30.990> tell<00:04:31.990> it's<00:04:32.139> a<00:04:32.260> consistency<00:04:33.070> that's<00:04:33.250> like

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
down tell it's a consistency that's like

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.790 
down tell it's a consistency that's like
syrup<00:04:36.690> I'm<00:04:37.690> not<00:04:37.900> sure<00:04:38.080> if<00:04:38.169> you<00:04:38.260> can<00:04:38.350> really<00:04:38.500> see

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
syrup I'm not sure if you can really see

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.900 
syrup I'm not sure if you can really see
that<00:04:38.830> when<00:04:39.100> I<00:04:39.130> was<00:04:39.220> talking<00:04:39.580> about<00:04:39.639> it<00:04:39.820> but

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
that when I was talking about it but

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.090 
that when I was talking about it but
it's<00:04:40.030> almost<00:04:40.150> like<00:04:40.449> a<00:04:40.479> fine<00:04:41.139> dust<00:04:41.560> or<00:04:41.889> a<00:04:41.949> really

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
it's almost like a fine dust or a really

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.250 
it's almost like a fine dust or a really
fine<00:04:42.490> coffee<00:04:42.940> ground<00:04:43.360> or<00:04:43.599> whatever<00:04:43.870> that<00:04:44.020> gets

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
fine coffee ground or whatever that gets

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.409 
fine coffee ground or whatever that gets
into<00:04:44.530> that<00:04:44.560> birch<00:04:44.979> sap<00:04:45.910> when<00:04:46.150> you're<00:04:46.300> boiling

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
into that birch sap when you're boiling

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.089 
into that birch sap when you're boiling
it<00:04:46.690> down<00:04:46.840> this<00:04:46.990> is<00:04:47.139> the<00:04:47.260> second<00:04:47.650> time<00:04:47.830> that<00:04:47.860> I

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:48.099 
it down this is the second time that I

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:49.529 
it down this is the second time that I
have<00:04:48.250> filtered<00:04:48.639> it<00:04:48.760> with<00:04:48.880> a<00:04:48.910> coffee<00:04:49.240> filter

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
have filtered it with a coffee filter

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.930 
have filtered it with a coffee filter
but<00:04:50.380> and<00:04:50.680> then<00:04:50.800> it<00:04:50.979> clears<00:04:51.400> it<00:04:51.550> up<00:04:51.639> pretty<00:04:51.849> good

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
but and then it clears it up pretty good

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.690 
but and then it clears it up pretty good
so<00:04:52.300> that's<00:04:53.200> what<00:04:53.440> we<00:04:53.530> got<00:04:53.650> right<00:04:53.889> now<00:04:54.130> and

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
so that's what we got right now and

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.140 
so that's what we got right now and
we're<00:04:54.910> gonna<00:04:55.030> now<00:04:55.349> like<00:04:56.349> I<00:04:56.500> said<00:04:56.560> get<00:04:56.979> that

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
we're gonna now like I said get that

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.350 
we're gonna now like I said get that
evaporated<00:04:58.150> down<00:04:58.419> to<00:04:58.690> syrup

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
evaporated down to syrup

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.879 
evaporated down to syrup
okay<00:05:01.360> everyone<00:05:01.570> well<00:05:01.870> this<00:05:02.050> is<00:05:02.229> just<00:05:02.260> about

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
ready to be put into the jar now birch

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.240 
ready to be put into the jar now birch
sap<00:05:07.360> that's<00:05:08.020> made<00:05:08.200> into<00:05:08.380> syrup<00:05:08.650> is<00:05:08.889> not<00:05:09.070> as

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
sap that's made into syrup is not as

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.610 
sap that's made into syrup is not as
thick<00:05:09.550> as<00:05:09.729> like<00:05:09.910> maple<00:05:10.389> and<00:05:10.990> it's<00:05:11.229> starting<00:05:11.530> to

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
thick as like maple and it's starting to

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.830 
thick as like maple and it's starting to
foam<00:05:11.830> a<00:05:11.860> little<00:05:11.979> bit<00:05:12.539> luckily<00:05:13.539> it<00:05:13.660> never

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
foam a little bit luckily it never

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.050 
foam a little bit luckily it never
boiled<00:05:14.289> there<00:05:14.470> is<00:05:14.560> no<00:05:14.740> burnt<00:05:15.160> taste<00:05:15.430> to<00:05:15.729> it<00:05:15.760> but
