00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.550
 flash on this day I will teach you to 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.019
 flashing or daring motorola with a 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.040
 tool called the phone flyer 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.040
 let's start with the video 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.260
 today fly we will make a firmware 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.120
 any on any engine hello the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.840
 first thing to do is enter 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.840
 facebook mode 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.690
 Well the first thing we should do is 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.690
 turn off the device 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.170
 and once turned off we should do 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.600
 is to press 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.810
 the power key and the volume key - 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.060
 for about 3 or 5 seconds and release the 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.750
 same time and we proceed to connect it to 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.750
 Computer 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.460
 once connected on facebook what 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:25.469
 we must do is download a firmware 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.200
 like the one that I have here and also 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:32.509
 we must decompress it as we are going to 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.509
 give right click to extract here 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.840
 and once it 's compressed they'll have one 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.420
 folder with all these files that 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.400
 it will be all the firmware 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.240
 once downloaded we will open 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.240
 our application 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.450
 but we will not proceed to flash since 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.369
 will mark us an error like the one that goes 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.229
 to appear below we choose 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.549
 our device in this case a 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.670
 motor or the bike that first 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.670
 generation 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:05.530
 and we select the option to flash a 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.780
 firmware we give in du and we can see 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.460
 that marks us an error because 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.810
 it says we should put a firmware 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.720
 inside the folder of our 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.990
 device in the directory of the 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.990

 let's go to local disk c 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.959
 let's go to program files 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.959

 folder we are going to copy all the 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.930
 files in our word end 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:52.370
 we are going to copy inside the folder 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.370
 of your device's firmware 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.080
 We are going to copy and we will give 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:58.080
 continue 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.710
 once they are already copied we can 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.680
 close the windows and we can continue 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:16.620

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.110
