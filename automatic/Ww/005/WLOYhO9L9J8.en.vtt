00:00:59.940 --> 00:00:59.950 
going to first fold in half so that I

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.770 
going to first fold in half so that I
know<00:01:00.040> where<00:01:00.310> my<00:01:00.340> center<00:01:00.850> is<00:01:01.000> I'm<00:01:01.600> just<00:01:01.690> going

flip<00:01:31.569> everything<00:01:31.840> over<00:01:32.289> and<00:01:32.950> I'm<00:01:33.069> going<00:01:33.219> to

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
flip everything over and I'm going to

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.669 
flip everything over and I'm going to
take<00:01:33.579> that<00:01:33.909> top<00:01:34.210> edge<00:01:34.479> and<00:01:34.780> roll<00:01:35.049> it<00:01:35.200> down<00:01:35.409> so

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:35.679 
take that top edge and roll it down so

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:37.169 
take that top edge and roll it down so
that<00:01:35.710> it's<00:01:35.979> even<00:01:36.280> with<00:01:36.579> the<00:01:36.700> center<00:01:36.999> that<00:01:37.149> i

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 
that it's even with the center that i

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:40.080 
that it's even with the center that i
have<00:01:37.389> here<00:01:37.420> and<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:39.009> want<00:01:39.100> to<00:01:39.249> try<00:01:39.399> to<00:01:39.429> keep

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
have here and you want to try to keep

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.300 
have here and you want to try to keep
everything<00:01:40.240> nice<00:01:40.600> and<00:01:40.659> straight<00:01:41.319> you<00:01:42.100> don't

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
everything nice and straight you don't

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.950 
everything nice and straight you don't
want<00:01:42.429> to<00:01:42.490> have<00:01:42.639> too<00:01:43.060> much<00:01:43.090> space<00:01:43.600> down<00:01:43.929> here

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
want to have too much space down here

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.199 
want to have too much space down here
now<00:01:44.409> if<00:01:44.740> you<00:01:44.889> happen<00:01:45.219> to<00:01:45.369> be<00:01:45.490> using<00:01:45.670> some<00:01:45.969> paper

00:01:46.199 --> 00:01:46.209 
now if you happen to be using some paper

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:48.300 
now if you happen to be using some paper
that<00:01:46.479> was<00:01:46.569> a<00:01:46.630> little<00:01:46.990> narrow<00:01:47.200> and<00:01:47.499> you<00:01:48.039> get<00:01:48.189> to

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
that was a little narrow and you get to

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.129 
that was a little narrow and you get to
this<00:01:48.429> point<00:01:48.789> you<00:01:49.090> notice<00:01:49.450> that<00:01:49.479> down<00:01:49.869> here

00:01:50.129 --> 00:01:50.139 
this point you notice that down here

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:51.929 
this point you notice that down here
you've<00:01:50.289> got<00:01:50.319> like<00:01:50.770> a<00:01:50.799> lot<00:01:51.130> of<00:01:51.249> excess<00:01:51.609> paper

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
you've got like a lot of excess paper

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:54.090 
you've got like a lot of excess paper
then<00:01:52.719> you<00:01:52.810> can<00:01:52.959> go<00:01:53.079> ahead<00:01:53.139> and<00:01:53.259> trim<00:01:53.530> it<00:01:53.679> up<00:01:53.770> but

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
then you can go ahead and trim it up but

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.969 
then you can go ahead and trim it up but
ideally<00:01:54.759> you<00:01:54.909> should<00:01:54.939> have<00:01:55.270> about<00:01:55.539> here<00:01:56.289> about

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
ideally you should have about here about

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.499 
ideally you should have about here about
the<00:01:57.130> same<00:01:57.310> width<00:01:57.579> is<00:01:57.759> what<00:01:57.939> we<00:01:58.030> kind<00:01:58.240> of<00:01:58.270> fold

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
the same width is what we kind of fold

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.899 
the same width is what we kind of fold
it<00:01:58.659> over<00:01:58.779> mine's<00:01:59.709> just<00:01:59.950> a<00:02:00.100> tad<00:02:00.310> bit<00:02:00.520> wider<00:02:00.700> and

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
it over mine's just a tad bit wider and

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:02.699 
it over mine's just a tad bit wider and
that's<00:02:01.060> not<00:02:01.209> a<00:02:01.270> problem<00:02:01.509> but<00:02:02.079> if<00:02:02.200> it<00:02:02.289> was<00:02:02.409> a<00:02:02.439> lot

00:02:02.699 --> 00:02:02.709 
that's not a problem but if it was a lot

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:04.739 
that's not a problem but if it was a lot
a<00:02:02.950> whole<00:02:03.549> lot<00:02:03.759> wider<00:02:03.999> than<00:02:04.149> you<00:02:04.389> might<00:02:04.539> want<00:02:04.689> to

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:04.749 
a whole lot wider than you might want to

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:07.109 
a whole lot wider than you might want to
just<00:02:04.840> trim<00:02:05.079> it<00:02:05.139> off<00:02:05.259> a<00:02:05.319> little<00:02:05.439> bit<00:02:05.969> so<00:02:06.969> then

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
just trim it off a little bit so then

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.029 
just trim it off a little bit so then
we've<00:02:07.389> got<00:02:07.420> this<00:02:07.749> whole<00:02:07.990> part<00:02:08.259> here<00:02:08.590> I'm<00:02:08.770> just

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
we've got this whole part here I'm just

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.889 
we've got this whole part here I'm just
going<00:02:09.160> to<00:02:09.190> take<00:02:09.490> the<00:02:09.759> very<00:02:10.030> first<00:02:10.390> layer<00:02:10.689> of

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
going to take the very first layer of

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.869 
going to take the very first layer of
paper<00:02:11.080> and<00:02:11.439> fold<00:02:12.129> snug<00:02:12.580> against<00:02:13.030> this<00:02:13.269> edge

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:18.860 

and<00:02:17.879> then<00:02:18.000> I'm<00:02:18.090> going<00:02:18.209> to<00:02:18.299> flip<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:18.569> over<00:02:18.719> and

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
and then I'm going to flip it over and

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:25.190 
and then I'm going to flip it over and
fold<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.409> other<00:02:19.439> side<00:02:19.859> up<00:02:20.069> to<00:02:23.989> then<00:02:24.989> real

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
fold the other side up to then real

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.690 
fold the other side up to then real
quick<00:02:25.230> I'm<00:02:25.560> just<00:02:25.739> going<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:25.950> fold<00:02:26.189> that<00:02:26.400> part

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
quick I'm just going to fold that part

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.610 
quick I'm just going to fold that part
down<00:02:26.879> for<00:02:27.239> a<00:02:27.269> second<00:02:27.689> and<00:02:27.870> what<00:02:28.109> I<00:02:28.140> want<00:02:28.319> to<00:02:28.469> do

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
down for a second and what I want to do

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.179 
down for a second and what I want to do
is<00:02:29.269> take<00:02:30.269> this<00:02:30.930> little<00:02:31.170> excess<00:02:31.680> that<00:02:31.829> you<00:02:32.010> see

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:32.189 
is take this little excess that you see

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:34.690 
is take this little excess that you see
here<00:02:32.459> and<00:02:32.519> fold<00:02:32.849> it<00:02:33.000> snug<00:02:33.359> against<00:02:33.659> the<00:02:33.750> edge

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
here and fold it snug against the edge

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.940 
here and fold it snug against the edge
keep<00:02:35.700> that<00:02:35.879> stuck<00:02:36.269> behind<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:37.049> then<00:02:37.859> I'm

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
keep that stuck behind and then I'm

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.289 
keep that stuck behind and then I'm
going<00:02:38.099> to<00:02:38.129> do<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.370> same<00:02:38.549> thing<00:02:38.790> with<00:02:38.939> this<00:02:39.060> one

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
going to do the same thing with this one

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.199 
going to do the same thing with this one
here<00:02:39.599> to<00:02:40.340> what<00:02:41.340> I<00:02:41.370> actually<00:02:41.549> want<00:02:41.909> to<00:02:42.000> do<00:02:42.090> is

here to what I actually want to do is

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.599 
here to what I actually want to do is
pop<00:02:42.510> that<00:02:42.810> right<00:02:43.200> in<00:02:43.409> front<00:02:43.829> so<00:02:44.310> that<00:02:44.340> its

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609 
pop that right in front so that its

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:51.229 
pop that right in front so that its
resting<00:02:45.329> right<00:02:45.480> in<00:02:45.659> front<00:02:46.790> this<00:02:47.790> one<00:02:47.849> too<00:02:50.239> then

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
resting right in front this one too then

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.360 
resting right in front this one too then
when<00:02:51.810> I<00:02:51.840> turn<00:02:52.169> it<00:02:52.349> over<00:02:52.439> and<00:02:52.650> I<00:02:52.799> put<00:02:53.010> that<00:02:53.159> part

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
when I turn it over and I put that part

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.520 
when I turn it over and I put that part
back<00:02:53.579> up<00:02:53.790> again<00:02:54.120> I<00:02:54.329> can<00:02:54.689> do<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.959> similar<00:02:55.169> kind

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
back up again I can do the similar kind

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.409 
back up again I can do the similar kind
of<00:02:55.680> thing<00:02:55.739> here<00:02:56.129> I'm<00:02:56.220> just<00:02:56.250> going<00:02:56.430> to<00:02:56.579> go<00:02:56.819> snug

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:57.419 
of thing here I'm just going to go snug

00:02:57.419 --> 00:02:58.729 
of thing here I'm just going to go snug
against<00:02:57.689> those<00:02:57.810> edges<00:02:58.169> to<00:02:58.319> get<00:02:58.409> a<00:02:58.470> crease

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
against those edges to get a crease

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.360 
against those edges to get a crease
started<00:02:59.220> and<00:02:59.840> then<00:03:00.840> this<00:03:01.019> time<00:03:01.379> when<00:03:01.889> I<00:03:01.919> take

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
started and then this time when I take

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.420 
started and then this time when I take
this<00:03:02.730> I<00:03:03.060> can<00:03:03.389> then<00:03:03.659> let<00:03:04.169> it<00:03:04.200> rest<00:03:04.590> right<00:03:05.219> in

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
this I can then let it rest right in

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.179 
this I can then let it rest right in
here<00:03:06.079> and<00:03:07.079> matching<00:03:07.650> up<00:03:07.769> with<00:03:07.799> that<00:03:08.040> other

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:08.189 
here and matching up with that other

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:09.800 
here and matching up with that other
creased<00:03:08.579> edge<00:03:08.790> and<00:03:09.120> that'll<00:03:09.359> keep<00:03:09.510> everything

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
creased edge and that'll keep everything

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.649 
creased edge and that'll keep everything
looking<00:03:10.290> kind<00:03:10.500> of<00:03:10.590> nice<00:03:10.739> and<00:03:12.469> smooth<00:03:14.659> once

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 
looking kind of nice and smooth once

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.339 
looking kind of nice and smooth once
I've<00:03:15.810> gotten<00:03:16.139> those<00:03:16.290> two<00:03:16.680> parts<00:03:17.310> folded<00:03:18.030> over

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 
I've gotten those two parts folded over

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.110 
I've gotten those two parts folded over
then<00:03:19.349> I'm<00:03:19.500> going<00:03:19.650> to<00:03:19.739> take<00:03:19.979> these<00:03:20.280> tips<00:03:20.790> and

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
then I'm going to take these tips and

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.390 
then I'm going to take these tips and
tuck<00:03:21.629> them<00:03:21.659> into<00:03:22.169> this<00:03:22.500> little<00:03:22.709> bit<00:03:22.889> of<00:03:22.979> pocket

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
tuck them into this little bit of pocket

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.119 
tuck them into this little bit of pocket
that<00:03:23.549> you<00:03:23.699> see<00:03:23.909> right<00:03:24.060> there<00:03:24.389> and<00:03:24.919> this<00:03:25.919> is

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
that you see right there and this is

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:27.890 
that you see right there and this is
another<00:03:26.370> part<00:03:26.729> where<00:03:26.970> you<00:03:27.120> can<00:03:27.299> kind<00:03:27.479> of<00:03:27.629> play

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
another part where you can kind of play

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.930 
another part where you can kind of play
around<00:03:27.930> with<00:03:28.560> how<00:03:29.159> much<00:03:29.310> space<00:03:29.639> you're<00:03:29.909> going

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
around with how much space you're going

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.429 
around with how much space you're going
to<00:03:30.090> give<00:03:30.239> yourself<00:03:30.359> down<00:03:30.780> here<00:03:30.989> to<00:03:31.109> give<00:03:31.290> you

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:31.439 
to give yourself down here to give you

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:33.439 
to give yourself down here to give you
the<00:03:31.590> width<00:03:31.829> of<00:03:32.099> everything<00:03:32.609> I'm<00:03:33.090> just<00:03:33.329> going

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:33.449 
the width of everything I'm just going

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:35.149 
the width of everything I'm just going
to<00:03:33.479> try<00:03:33.720> to<00:03:33.750> fold<00:03:34.049> this<00:03:34.229> up<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.530> little<00:03:34.650> bit<00:03:34.919> at<00:03:35.129> a

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:35.159 
to try to fold this up a little bit at a

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:36.920 
to try to fold this up a little bit at a
little<00:03:35.489> angle<00:03:35.849> so<00:03:36.030> that<00:03:36.060> gets<00:03:36.329> snug<00:03:36.659> right

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
little angle so that gets snug right

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.969 
little angle so that gets snug right
with<00:03:37.109> this<00:03:37.290> white<00:03:38.040> paper<00:03:38.430> edge<00:03:38.790> and<00:03:39.889> then<00:03:40.889> you

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:40.979 
with this white paper edge and then you

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:42.379 
with this white paper edge and then you
want<00:03:41.129> to<00:03:41.220> try<00:03:41.400> of<00:03:41.459> course<00:03:41.549> to<00:03:41.970> do<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.209> same

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
want to try of course to do the same

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.679 
want to try of course to do the same
thing<00:03:42.720> for<00:03:42.959> the<00:03:43.019> other<00:03:43.109> side<00:03:43.590> too<00:03:44.329> so<00:03:45.329> try<00:03:45.659> to

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:45.689 
thing for the other side too so try to

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:48.949 
thing for the other side too so try to
get<00:03:46.099> you<00:03:47.099> know<00:03:47.220> similar<00:03:47.699> shape<00:03:48.000> going<00:03:48.540> coming

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
get you know similar shape going coming

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:55.460 
get you know similar shape going coming
in<00:03:49.079> a<00:03:49.229> similar<00:03:49.590> angle<00:03:53.840> you<00:03:54.840> can<00:03:55.019> kind<00:03:55.229> of<00:03:55.290> play

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
in a similar angle you can kind of play

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.020 
in a similar angle you can kind of play
with<00:03:55.500> that<00:03:55.829> to<00:03:56.069> see<00:03:56.280> you<00:03:56.639> know<00:03:56.729> that<00:03:56.849> you<00:03:56.909> get

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
with that to see you know that you get

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.390 
with that to see you know that you get
similar<00:03:57.329> shapes<00:03:57.720> here<00:03:58.079> if<00:03:58.259> you<00:03:58.349> can<00:03:58.560> so<00:03:59.280> that

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
similar shapes here if you can so that

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.999 
similar shapes here if you can so that
we<00:03:59.549> get<00:03:59.699> something<00:04:00.299> like<00:04:00.659> this<00:04:00.900> and<00:04:01.259> that's

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:02.009 
we get something like this and that's

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:05.509 
we get something like this and that's
your<00:04:02.370> completed<00:04:02.790> nature<00:04:03.689> so<00:04:04.290> in<00:04:05.129> terms<00:04:05.310> of

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
your completed nature so in terms of

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.610 
your completed nature so in terms of
dimensions<00:04:06.180> I<00:04:06.389> suppose<00:04:06.780> you<00:04:07.290> know<00:04:07.409> basically

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
dimensions I suppose you know basically

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.770 
dimensions I suppose you know basically
in<00:04:08.129> terms<00:04:08.340> of<00:04:08.459> just<00:04:08.669> as<00:04:08.849> a<00:04:08.879> flat<00:04:09.209> shape<00:04:09.599> if

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
in terms of just as a flat shape if

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:10.879 
in terms of just as a flat shape if
you're<00:04:09.900> just<00:04:10.079> doing<00:04:10.259> a<00:04:10.290> two<00:04:10.470> dimensional

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
you're just doing a two dimensional

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:14.899 
you're just doing a two dimensional
piece<00:04:11.129> this<00:04:11.939> is<00:04:12.209> six<00:04:12.720> by<00:04:13.019> five<00:04:13.290> centimeters<00:04:13.979> so

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:14.909 
piece this is six by five centimeters so

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:18.860 
piece this is six by five centimeters so
it's<00:04:15.060> six<00:04:15.629> centimeters<00:04:16.470> wide<00:04:16.739> and<00:04:17.870> five

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
it's six centimeters wide and five

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.370 
it's six centimeters wide and five
centimeters<00:04:19.530> tall<00:04:19.940> now<00:04:20.940> the<00:04:21.000> of<00:04:21.930> course

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
centimeters tall now the of course

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.689 
centimeters tall now the of course
important<00:04:22.830> thing<00:04:22.949> if<00:04:23.039> you're<00:04:23.159> using<00:04:23.310> this<00:04:23.490> is

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 
important thing if you're using this is

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:25.219 
important thing if you're using this is
a<00:04:23.729> three<00:04:24.090> dimensional<00:04:24.210> piece<00:04:24.779> you<00:04:24.990> want<00:04:25.080> to

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
a three dimensional piece you want to

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:25.640 
a three dimensional piece you want to
know<00:04:25.320> how

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
know how

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.460 
know how
big<00:04:25.940> the<00:04:26.940> space<00:04:27.330> will<00:04:27.570> be<00:04:27.690> for<00:04:27.900> the<00:04:27.930> head<00:04:28.169> and

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
big the space will be for the head and

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.850 
big the space will be for the head and
the<00:04:28.949> opening<00:04:29.639> for<00:04:30.030> the<00:04:30.060> head<00:04:30.360> is<00:04:30.860> 4

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
the opening for the head is 4

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:39.200 
the opening for the head is 4
centimeters<00:04:36.229> so<00:04:37.229> of<00:04:37.380> course<00:04:37.560> if<00:04:37.800> you<00:04:38.210> times

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
centimeters so of course if you times

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.900 
centimeters so of course if you times
that<00:04:39.330> by<00:04:39.449> 2<00:04:39.630> that's<00:04:40.590> your<00:04:40.830> diameter<00:04:41.340> then<00:04:41.490> so

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
that by 2 that's your diameter then so

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.310 
that by 2 that's your diameter then so
you<00:04:41.970> know<00:04:42.060> you<00:04:42.210> have<00:04:42.300> eight<00:04:42.600> centimeters<00:04:43.169> to
