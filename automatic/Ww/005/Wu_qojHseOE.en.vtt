00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:08.609
 but 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.609
 how wolves change rivers 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:30.390
 he is one of the most exciting scientific 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.489
 discoveries over the past half century of affection 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.460
 detection of widespread 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.699
 trophic cascades 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.430
 trophic cascade environmental process 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:43.580
 beginning at the top of the food now 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.080
 descending to its very foundation 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.440
 classic example is what happened in 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:52.650
 Yellowstone National Park in the USA 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:55.260
 when in 1995 wolves were brought back 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:58.260
 there of course we all know that in 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.479
 call different types of animals but that's what 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:06.330
 not so well known is that 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:08.070
 they give life to many other ass to 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.280
 how wolves reappeared 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.869
 since they were absent as much as 70 years 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.520
 deer population due to the fact that they are 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.400
 there was no one to hunt in the park 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.740
 yellowstone grew and grew despite 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.850
 all the efforts of people to control and they 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.400
 managed to reduce the number 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.860
 vegetation little land they 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.869
 just plucked it cleaned but how 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.619
 only wolves came despite their small 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.999
 number 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.020
 they began to render astounding 

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:35.189
 effects in the first place due to the fact that they 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.289
 killed some deer 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.179
 but it was not the most important world much 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.240
 more they radically changed 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:45.210
 deer behavior on giving has become 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.759
 avoid certain areas of the park where 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.700
 they could track down the easiest especially 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.189
 hollow and tissen and immediately these places 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.439
 began to recover in some 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.630
 areas tree height increased in 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.539
 five times in just six years 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:04.170
 ruined slopes of hollows how fast 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:07.020
 thickets of aspen and poplar forests 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.569
 bags as soon as it happened became 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.400
 populated by birds the number of choristers and 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.069
 migratory birds and start abruptly 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.380
 increase by the number of beavers became 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.380
 grow up because beavers love flattery and 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.080
 trees and both breaks and wolves are 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.540
 the designer have and the systems they create 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.160
 niches for other species 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.069
 dams that they build in rivers 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.300
 give home in the muskrat games and more 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.660
 ducks fish 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.910
 reptiles and amphibians dubovsky wolves 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.690
 coyotes were killed and as a result began to grow 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:42.180
 the number of rabbits and mice which meant 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.239
 more hawks weasels foxes and 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.239
 badgers 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.200
 the crows and eagles descended to earth 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.480
 to eat carrion left over 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.060
 wolves bears ate it too 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.860
 their population began to grow in part 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.720
 the reason for this growth is that in growing 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.730
 shrubs became more berries 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.190
 press pro bears increased influence 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.360
 the appearance of wolves due to the killing 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:09.680
 some parts of deer 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:15.030
 and here begins the most interesting 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:17.880
 wolves changed smoke rarely grew in 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.920
 America began to squirm eye became Alyosha 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.320
 erosion just narrowed 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.370
 formed more creeks on them became 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.900
 more rapids all this 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.709
 favorably affected the ranges of wild 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.049
 of nature 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.329
 way and the rivers changed in response to 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.670
 the appearance of wolves and the reason was 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:38.459
 that the regenerating forests strengthened 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.890
 shores reducing their shedding so 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.870
 way the river beds became more 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.150
 constant in a similar way this 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.920
 affected the ravines forcing out the deer 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.530
 from some places they gave 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.049
 vegetation on the slopes of hollows where too 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.500
 there was soil erosion recover and so 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:57.299
 a small number of wolves transformed 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.069
 the floor is not only national ecosystems 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.079
 yellowstone park this huge 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.850
 land territory but also 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.000
 transformed and and physical 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.000
 geography
