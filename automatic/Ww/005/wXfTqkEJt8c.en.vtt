unnecessary<00:03:41.599> in<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:41.780> grand<00:03:41.989> scheme<00:03:42.199> of

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
unnecessary in the grand scheme of

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.349 
unnecessary in the grand scheme of
things<00:03:42.379> animation<00:03:43.340> is<00:03:43.489> the<00:03:43.519> same<00:03:43.760> style<00:03:44.060> last

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
things animation is the same style last

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.119 
things animation is the same style last
time<00:03:44.690> but<00:03:44.900> I<00:03:44.959> think<00:03:45.109> they<00:03:45.530> made<00:03:45.709> the<00:03:45.799> ponies

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:46.129 
time but I think they made the ponies

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:47.830 
time but I think they made the ponies
less<00:03:46.459> horse<00:03:46.819> like<00:03:47.030> as<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.299> body<00:03:47.480> seemed<00:03:47.810> a

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
less horse like as the body seemed a

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.410 
less horse like as the body seemed a
little<00:03:48.199> whiter<00:03:48.530> than<00:03:48.799> usual

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.840 

now<00:03:52.380> for<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:52.620> comparison<00:03:53.010> and<00:03:53.310> if<00:03:53.520> you<00:03:53.610> didn't

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
now for the comparison and if you didn't

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:54.950 
now for the comparison and if you didn't
guess<00:03:54.030> we'll<00:03:54.270> be<00:03:54.390> comparing<00:03:54.840> it<00:03:54.900> to

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:54.960 
guess we'll be comparing it to

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.480 
guess we'll be comparing it to
inspiration<00:03:55.530> manifestation<00:03:56.160> and<00:03:56.280> it's

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.490 
inspiration manifestation and it's

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.280 
inspiration manifestation and it's
conflict<00:03:56.910> with<00:03:57.000> spike<00:03:57.209> and<00:03:57.330> rarity<00:03:57.510> -<00:03:58.110> rapa

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
well the resolution inspiration

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.870 
well the resolution inspiration
manifestation<00:04:09.600> is<00:04:09.959> more<00:04:10.290> believable

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
manifestation is more believable

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.850

was past the point of no return
or<00:04:22.710> more<00:04:23.220> specifically<00:04:23.669> past<00:04:24.150> the<00:04:24.300> point

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
we're just talking about it would be

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.220 
we're just talking about it would be
enough<00:04:26.430> to<00:04:26.460> break<00:04:26.760> her<00:04:26.940> out<00:04:27.060> of<00:04:27.210> her<00:04:27.300> addiction
