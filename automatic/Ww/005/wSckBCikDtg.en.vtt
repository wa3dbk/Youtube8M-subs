00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.290
 editorial infotainment 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.870
 portal game mail ru with the participation of 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:31.720
 fx and studio presents new release 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.310
 our traditional video reviews today 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.680
 we will tell you about the fifth part 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.100
 the elder epic role-playing series 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.230
 scrolls 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.230
 wearing the subtitle skyrim 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.710
 but 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.430
 elder scrolls are incredibly popular and 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.710
 series of role-playing games in the genre of fantasy 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.259
 4 her part has somewhat lost ground 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.869
 got enough critical ratings 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.540
 but 5 rehabilitated the series in the eyes 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.580
 fans judge for just two 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.920
 day was sold half circulation 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.560
 games over seven million copies 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.560
 the reason for this popularity is 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.479
 freedom which gives the player skyrim here 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.210
 you can wander around the vast world for hours 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.880
 castles knights and other medieval 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.220
 attribution is allowed by the fact that 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.360
 you are interested in fishing for example or 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.280
 admire the stars 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.990
 Well, if you wish, you can perform quests 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.250
 which there are hundreds and unravel the tangle 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.250
 plot entry 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:53.390
 so turn of epochs and appears 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.390
 Dovakin 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.009
 action of the fifth part of the game 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.299
 takes place in the northern province 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.299
 empire tamriel 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:03.250
 Skyrim it is populated by drivers who 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.140
 clearly written off the Vikings and because 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.209
 differ very specific 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.220
 temperament that is if at night you 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:11.470
 ask the first comer how to pass 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.519
 to the library, instead of answering, you risk 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.519
 get hit yes beards 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.120
 in a brief introduction to you as usual 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.519
 asked to name the hero and choose for him 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.909
 race and then down on all four 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.010
 parties 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:27.019
 since in all corners of skyrim 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.540
 something is constantly going on 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:32.170
 the main character will not remain snow-covered 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.610
 the region is generally very interesting to explore 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.709
 attractions here are enough for 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.900
 the top of the highest mountain can be found 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.930
 monastery of elders who are hermits 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.390
 master the magic of words underground hidden 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.209
 the ruins of the civilization of the gnomes of the inventors 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.640
 their secrets reliably guard the mechanical 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.739
 countries as befits a large-scale role-playing 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.450
 the world of Skyrim is not strong in hundreds 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.640
 convincingly voiced characters with 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.140
 most developed characters 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.269
 of them are ready at the first meeting 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.150
 pour out your soul and give some 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.069
 request thank you very much for the fact that 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.709
 took care of these wars 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:09.109
 bring me some tasks from discharge 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.780
 something pretty straightforward and others 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:13.909
 open up whole storylines so as not to 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.069
 get tangled in them the hero has a diary 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:19.510
 and not to get lost in a huge world 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.510
 there is a convenient compass 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:27.650
 skyrim is simpler and more convenient than 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.079
 previous parts but in general everything is in it 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.459
 stayed the same as before 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.810
 contemplate the world around will have to 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.909
 first-person view 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.640
 view from the back are also present but 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:39.379
 implemented traditionally nasty reflexes 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.780
 and accuracy when passing skyrim 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:44.360
 the main thing is not important 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.099
 pick up equipment and skills all skills 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.349
 must be manually pumped 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.390
 for example to become a virtuoso swordsman 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:52.760
 need to constantly hack someone 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.590
 into pieces to improve other qualities 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.709
 they also need to use as much as possible 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.709
 more often 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:02.269
 find flaws in skyrim difficult 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.760
 honestly don't even want to try 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.299
 unless the type from 1 person is not so convenient 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.000
 in battle 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:10.069
 but millions of fans of the series over the years 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.629
 accustomed to this feature and for sure 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:14.030
 will accept changes to bayonets 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:16.340
 in fact the only thing that has 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.549
 value is how much the game carries 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.199
 and new creation studio bethesda 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.270
 delays the game so much 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:25.460
 scale that can easily carry on 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.500
 few weeks so if you buy 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.449
 box or order skyrim digital 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.520
 steam service do not forget to warn 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.440
 about it relatives and friends let them not 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.970
 wondering why you do not answer the phone 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.970
 and do not appear on the street 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:53.120
 skyrim can be repeated 

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:55.430
 every time you will discover something 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.470
 new hope the authors of the series and beyond 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:01.449
 will follow the same course and we still 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.449
 We will be in the vastness of Tamriel
