00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
alright so this last little bit of demo

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.559 
alright so this last little bit of demo
I<00:00:03.959> guess<00:00:04.319> is<00:00:04.790> Iran<00:00:05.790> at<00:00:05.940> a<00:00:06.000> time<00:00:06.180> on<00:00:06.330> the<00:00:06.420> last

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
I guess is Iran at a time on the last

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.950 
I guess is Iran at a time on the last
one<00:00:06.899> and<00:00:10.700> show<00:00:11.700> you<00:00:11.759> how<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:12.000> decipher<00:00:12.389> shapes

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
one and show you how to decipher shapes

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.779 
one and show you how to decipher shapes
within<00:00:13.290> hair<00:00:15.529> so<00:00:16.529> it's<00:00:16.740> like<00:00:16.830> yeah<00:00:17.100> I<00:00:17.130> might<00:00:17.400> be

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
within hair so it's like yeah I might be

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.400 
within hair so it's like yeah I might be
drawing<00:00:18.180> you<00:00:18.720> know<00:00:18.840> something<00:00:19.109> like<00:00:19.260> this

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
drawing you know something like this

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.060 
drawing you know something like this
which<00:00:19.680> looks<00:00:19.980> all<00:00:20.960> JP<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.170> design<00:00:22.800> ii<00:00:22.830> and

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
which looks all JP and design ii and

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.200 
which looks all JP and design ii and
whatnot<00:00:24.619> but<00:00:25.640> the<00:00:26.640> thing<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:26.849> that<00:00:27.060> when<00:00:27.180> i

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
whatnot but the thing is that when i

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.540 
whatnot but the thing is that when i
look<00:00:27.510> at<00:00:27.689> this<00:00:28.230> kind<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.619> shape<00:00:28.939> and<00:00:29.939> i<00:00:30.060> can<00:00:30.300> see

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
look at this kind of shape and i can see

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.350 
look at this kind of shape and i can see
can<00:00:32.550> see<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.850> form<00:00:33.120> in<00:00:33.329> this<00:00:33.570> shape<00:00:33.899> like<00:00:35.360> I'll

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
can see the form in this shape like I'll

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:45.350 
can see the form in this shape like I'll
just<00:00:36.660> start<00:00:37.350> gridding<00:00:37.770> things<00:00:42.500> and<00:00:44.360> so

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
just start gridding things and so

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.750 
just start gridding things and so
whenever<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.899> are<00:00:46.190> you<00:00:47.190> know<00:00:47.280> going<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.520> paint

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
whenever you are you know going to paint

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.500 
whenever you are you know going to paint
up<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.210> shape<00:00:49.110> like<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.789> it's<00:00:50.789> important<00:00:51.329> that

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
up a shape like this it's important that

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.209 
up a shape like this it's important that
you<00:00:51.539> can<00:00:52.110> see<00:00:54.230> the<00:00:55.230> actual<00:00:55.379> dimension<00:00:56.070> within

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
you can see the actual dimension within

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:59.690 
you can see the actual dimension within
the<00:00:56.460> shape

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.469 

even<00:02:00.630> though<00:02:00.780> it's<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.049> cutout<00:02:02.149> you<00:02:03.149> know<00:02:03.270> a

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
even though it's a cutout you know a

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.109 
even though it's a cutout you know a
flat<00:02:03.930> cut<00:02:04.289> out<00:02:04.439> it's<00:02:05.189> something<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.850> has

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
flat cut out it's something that has

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:19.200 
flat cut out it's something that has
within<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.259> three-dimensional<00:02:08.160> form<00:02:15.140> there

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.470 

if<00:02:19.570> i<00:02:19.690> go<00:02:19.840> ahead<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:20.110> shade<00:02:20.830> this<00:02:21.100> then<00:02:21.670> you

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
if i go ahead and shade this then you

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:34.330 
if i go ahead and shade this then you
know<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:22.720> result<00:02:23.050> is<00:02:24.450> something<00:02:25.450> like<00:02:25.750> this

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.300 

now

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
now

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.370 
now
I'm<00:02:36.580> going<00:02:36.970> into<00:02:37.120> each<00:02:37.360> and<00:02:37.660> every<00:02:37.840> individual

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
I'm going into each and every individual

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.250 
I'm going into each and every individual
piece<00:02:38.709> and<00:02:38.980> shading<00:02:39.370> it<00:02:39.489> but<00:02:39.940> you<00:02:40.900> know<00:02:40.959> all

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
piece and shading it but you know all

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.839 
piece and shading it but you know all
the<00:02:41.440> pieces<00:02:41.650> on<00:02:41.890> this<00:02:42.099> side<00:02:42.370> of<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:42.640> head<00:02:42.819> I

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
the pieces on this side of the head I

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:44.190 
the pieces on this side of the head I
think<00:02:43.030> I'm<00:02:43.360> probably<00:02:43.450> going<00:02:43.690> to<00:02:43.780> just<00:02:43.930> plunge

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
think I'm probably going to just plunge

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.520 
think I'm probably going to just plunge
the<00:02:44.380> minute<00:02:44.620> it<00:02:45.690> in<00:02:46.690> a<00:02:46.810> dark<00:02:47.080> there<00:02:49.440> so<00:02:50.440> you

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
the minute it in a dark there so you

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.870 
the minute it in a dark there so you
have<00:02:50.709> to<00:02:50.860> keep<00:02:51.040> in<00:02:51.280> mind<00:02:51.310> you<00:02:51.640> know<00:02:51.760> the

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
have to keep in mind you know the

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.780 
have to keep in mind you know the
overall<00:02:52.390> shape<00:02:52.750> of<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:53.050> head<00:02:53.080> don't<00:02:53.620> just<00:02:53.860> you

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
overall shape of the head don't just you

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.690 
overall shape of the head don't just you
know<00:02:56.010> like<00:02:57.010> you<00:02:57.160> can<00:02:57.310> shade<00:02:57.550> them

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
know like you can shade them

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.100 
know like you can shade them
individually<00:02:57.910> but<00:02:58.480> then<00:02:58.690> at<00:02:58.900> some<00:02:59.050> point

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
individually but then at some point

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.780 
individually but then at some point
you're<00:02:59.470> going<00:02:59.590> to<00:02:59.650> wind<00:02:59.860> up<00:02:59.920> just<00:02:59.980> plunging<00:03:00.550> a

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
you're going to wind up just plunging a

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
you're going to wind up just plunging a
large<00:03:01.690> part<00:03:02.080> of<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.200> head<00:03:02.410> in<00:03:02.650> darkness

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
large part of the head in darkness

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.690 
large part of the head in darkness
meanwhile<00:03:04.810> you'll<00:03:04.989> be<00:03:05.310> lighting<00:03:06.310> up<00:03:06.430> other

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
meanwhile you'll be lighting up other

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:15.990 
meanwhile you'll be lighting up other
sections<00:03:07.510> of<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:07.750> head<00:03:07.930> or<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:09.030> air<00:03:14.400> and<00:03:15.400> of

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
sections of the head or the air and of

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.009 
sections of the head or the air and of
course<00:03:16.209> you<00:03:16.360> know<00:03:16.480> you'd<00:03:16.630> be<00:03:16.660> using<00:03:16.870> a

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
course you know you'd be using a

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.680 
course you know you'd be using a
striated<00:03:17.350> brush<00:03:17.860> as<00:03:18.069> opposed<00:03:18.459> to<00:03:18.760> a<00:03:18.970> hard

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
striated brush as opposed to a hard

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.620 
striated brush as opposed to a hard
circle<00:03:20.080> brush<00:03:20.260> but<00:03:20.790> this<00:03:21.790> is<00:03:22.030> just<00:03:22.060> for

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
circle brush but this is just for

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.920 
circle brush but this is just for
demonstration<00:03:24.569> purposes<00:03:27.239> plus<00:03:28.239> I<00:03:28.390> am<00:03:28.510> not

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
demonstration purposes plus I am not

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.789 
demonstration purposes plus I am not
breaking<00:03:29.440> any<00:03:29.769> of<00:03:29.920> this<00:03:30.040> stuff<00:03:30.190> up<00:03:30.489> I'm<00:03:31.480> just

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.860 

in<00:03:35.799> the<00:03:36.160> shadowed<00:03:36.580> area<00:03:36.910> you<00:03:37.090> know<00:03:37.209> i'm<00:03:37.510> using

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
in the shadowed area you know i'm using

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.770 
in the shadowed area you know i'm using
a<00:03:40.320> crevice<00:03:42.000> going<00:03:43.000> in<00:03:43.090> there<00:03:43.269> with<00:03:43.359> a<00:03:43.390> crevice

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
a crevice going in there with a crevice

00:03:43.780 --> 00:04:17.240 
a crevice going in there with a crevice
tool<00:03:45.150> this<00:03:46.150> is<00:03:46.269> a<00:03:46.299> hard<00:03:46.450> circle<00:03:46.780> brush

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.030 

I<00:04:17.340> might<00:04:17.790> still<00:04:18.060> go<00:04:18.239> in<00:04:18.390> there<00:04:18.540> and<00:04:18.660> knock<00:04:19.140> this

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
I might still go in there and knock this

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.970 
I might still go in there and knock this
down<00:04:20.959> just<00:04:21.959> a<00:04:22.109> little<00:04:22.230> bit<00:04:22.320> further<00:04:22.680> and<00:04:22.830> make

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 
down just a little bit further and make

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:31.220 
down just a little bit further and make
it<00:04:23.100> a<00:04:23.130> little<00:04:23.220> less<00:04:23.400> flat<00:04:29.600> just<00:04:30.600> gets<00:04:30.840> more

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
it a little less flat just gets more

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:37.790 
it a little less flat just gets more
overall<00:04:31.650> shape<00:04:32.250> and<00:04:32.550> form<00:04:36.410> I'm<00:04:37.410> going<00:04:37.650> in

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
overall shape and form I'm going in

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.710 
overall shape and form I'm going in
there<00:04:37.920> fairly<00:04:38.340> large<00:04:38.670> brush<00:04:39.000> strokes<00:04:39.330> assess
