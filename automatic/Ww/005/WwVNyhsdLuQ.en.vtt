00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
was it just a matter of fixing the elbow

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.100 
was it just a matter of fixing the elbow
or<00:02:36.760> is<00:02:36.970> it<00:02:37.060> fixing<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.450> elbow<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:37.720> then<00:02:37.900> once

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
or is it fixing the elbow and then once

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.840 
or is it fixing the elbow and then once
that<00:02:38.200> was<00:02:38.440> kind<00:02:38.680> of<00:02:38.740> healed<00:02:39.640> then<00:02:39.760> you

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
that was kind of healed then you

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.580 
that was kind of healed then you
actually<00:02:40.030> rebuild<00:02:40.780> your<00:02:40.930> jump<00:02:41.170> shot<00:02:41.230> or<00:02:41.500> did

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
actually rebuild your jump shot or did

actually rebuild your jump shot or did
you<00:02:41.680> have<00:02:41.740> to<00:02:41.830> fix<00:02:42.100> the<00:02:42.250> shot<00:02:42.459> itself<00:02:42.790> it<00:02:43.060> was

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
you have to fix the shot itself it was

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.980 
you have to fix the shot itself it was
it<00:02:43.270> just<00:02:43.540> from<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.290> medical<00:02:44.620> side<00:02:44.770> yeah<00:02:45.990> it

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
it just from the medical side yeah it

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.900 
it just from the medical side yeah it
was<00:02:47.140> his<00:02:47.260> combination<00:02:47.920> of<00:02:48.040> both<00:02:48.160> had<00:02:48.610> to<00:02:48.700> fix

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
was his combination of both had to fix

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.770 
was his combination of both had to fix
the<00:02:49.270> the<00:02:49.810> elbow<00:02:50.110> first<00:02:51.330> then<00:02:52.330> the<00:02:52.450> strength

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
the the elbow first then the strength

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.340 
the the elbow first then the strength
came<00:02:52.990> in<00:02:53.260> and<00:02:53.470> because<00:02:53.950> of<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:55.810> injury<00:02:56.200> before

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
came in and because of the injury before

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.490 
came in and because of the injury before
I<00:02:56.620> was<00:02:56.890> doing<00:02:57.190> some<00:02:57.400> weird<00:02:57.670> thing<00:02:58.570> shooting

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
I was doing some weird thing shooting

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.800 
I was doing some weird thing shooting
why<00:02:59.680> so<00:02:59.920> I<00:02:59.950> had<00:03:00.100> to<00:03:00.130> retrain<00:03:00.640> myself<00:03:00.910> back<00:03:01.600> to

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
why so I had to retrain myself back to

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.470 
why so I had to retrain myself back to
normal<00:03:02.170> shooting<00:03:02.470> form<00:03:02.800> and<00:03:03.760> that's<00:03:03.910> probably

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
normal shooting form and that's probably

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.750 
normal shooting form and that's probably
been<00:03:04.810> probably<00:03:05.440> what's<00:03:06.070> been<00:03:06.250> taking<00:03:06.550> the

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
been probably what's been taking the

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.940 
been probably what's been taking the
longest<00:03:06.970> that<00:03:07.840> and<00:03:08.200> just<00:03:08.470> building<00:03:08.920> the

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
longest that and just building the

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.550 
longest that and just building the
strength<00:03:09.160> back<00:03:09.430> as<00:03:09.700> nerves<00:03:10.480> take<00:03:10.930> forever<00:03:11.260> and

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
strength back as nerves take forever and

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.830 
strength back as nerves take forever and
obviously<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.519> muscles<00:03:12.880> speed<00:03:13.600> from<00:03:13.810> the

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
obviously the muscles speed from the

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.720 
obviously the muscles speed from the
nerve<00:03:14.080> so<00:03:14.620> as<00:03:14.800> soon<00:03:14.950> as<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.100> nerve<00:03:15.250> turns<00:03:15.519> back

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
nerve so as soon as the nerve turns back

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.940 
nerve so as soon as the nerve turns back
then<00:03:16.090> the<00:03:16.209> muscles<00:03:16.570> it's<00:03:17.470> a<00:03:17.530> building<00:03:17.860> block

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
then the muscles it's a building block

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.840 
then the muscles it's a building block
type<00:03:18.430> of<00:03:18.580> thing

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
type of thing

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.790 
type of thing
the<00:03:20.360> biggest<00:03:20.540> issue<00:03:20.870> of<00:03:21.170> a<00:03:21.230> lot<00:03:21.410> of<00:03:21.530> people

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
the biggest issue of a lot of people

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.650 
the biggest issue of a lot of people
shooting<00:03:22.220> is<00:03:22.310> a<00:03:22.400> straight<00:03:22.670> conference<00:03:22.970> yeah

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
shooting is a straight conference yeah

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.860 
shooting is a straight conference yeah
bill<00:03:24.650> to<00:03:24.830> find<00:03:25.100> some<00:03:25.520> of<00:03:25.640> that<00:03:25.760> as<00:03:26.450> the<00:03:26.480> hilan

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
bill to find some of that as the hilan

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.710 
bill to find some of that as the hilan
courses<00:03:27.260> yeah<00:03:27.980> that's<00:03:28.340> I<00:03:28.730> think<00:03:29.180> that's<00:03:29.330> been

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
courses yeah that's I think that's been

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.690 
courses yeah that's I think that's been
probably<00:03:30.140> the<00:03:30.320> biggest<00:03:30.560> thing<00:03:30.770> for<00:03:30.800> me<00:03:31.070> is<00:03:31.340> now

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
probably the biggest thing for me is now

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.180 
probably the biggest thing for me is now

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
change in the composition of the team

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:51.990 
change in the composition of the team
from<00:05:48.190> last<00:05:48.250> year<00:05:48.790> how<00:05:49.660> is<00:05:49.810> this<00:05:50.400> you<00:05:51.400> just<00:05:51.550> kind

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
from last year how is this you just kind

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.520 
from last year how is this you just kind
of<00:05:52.120> understanding<00:05:52.750> each<00:05:52.900> other<00:05:53.080> i<00:05:53.169> think<00:05:53.410> we

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
of understanding each other i think we

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.129 
of understanding each other i think we
brought<00:05:53.770> in<00:05:53.950> some<00:05:54.280> really<00:05:54.910> good<00:05:55.120> pieces<00:05:55.419> guys

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:56.139 
brought in some really good pieces guys

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:58.740 
brought in some really good pieces guys
that<00:05:56.500> work<00:05:56.980> well<00:05:57.310> at<00:05:57.700> what<00:05:57.850> they<00:05:58.000> do<00:05:58.060> and<00:05:58.419> they

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.750 
that work well at what they do and they

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.810 
that work well at what they do and they
complement<00:05:59.200> our<00:05:59.260> big<00:05:59.500> guns<00:05:59.680> tomorrow<00:06:00.250> Kyle

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:00.820 
complement our big guns tomorrow Kyle

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:04.050 
complement our big guns tomorrow Kyle
Rudy<00:06:01.660> and<00:06:02.130> you<00:06:03.130> know<00:06:03.220> it's<00:06:03.610> always<00:06:03.790> great<00:06:04.030> when

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
Rudy and you know it's always great when

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.360 
Rudy and you know it's always great when
you<00:06:04.270> have<00:06:04.419> our<00:06:04.630> core<00:06:04.930> pieces<00:06:05.200> together<00:06:05.800> a

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
you have our core pieces together a

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.550 
you have our core pieces together a
whole<00:06:06.940> season<00:06:07.150> last<00:06:07.479> year<00:06:07.570> Rudy<00:06:07.870> came<00:06:08.080> in<00:06:08.290> and

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 
whole season last year Rudy came in and

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.200 
whole season last year Rudy came in and
you<00:06:08.919> know<00:06:09.040> it<00:06:09.100> was<00:06:09.190> a<00:06:09.220> big<00:06:09.400> spark<00:06:09.669> for<00:06:09.910> us<00:06:09.970> but

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 
you know it was a big spark for us but

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:11.790 
you know it was a big spark for us but
we<00:06:10.330> didn't<00:06:10.570> have<00:06:10.750> that<00:06:11.169> kind<00:06:11.200> of<00:06:11.530> chemistry

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
we didn't have that kind of chemistry

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.280 
we didn't have that kind of chemistry
that<00:06:12.100> we<00:06:12.460> kind<00:06:12.639> of<00:06:12.760> do<00:06:12.880> have<00:06:13.270> now<00:06:13.479> and<00:06:13.810> going

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:14.290 
that we kind of do have now and going

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.650 
that we kind of do have now and going
into<00:06:14.620> this<00:06:14.740> training<00:06:15.160> camp<00:06:15.400> I<00:06:16.120> think<00:06:16.540> we

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:16.660 
into this training camp I think we

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.150 
into this training camp I think we
understand<00:06:17.139> each<00:06:17.229> other<00:06:17.410> a<00:06:17.530> lot<00:06:17.710> better<00:06:17.770> and<00:06:18.100> I

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160 
understand each other a lot better and I

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.710 
understand each other a lot better and I
think<00:06:18.340> it<00:06:18.430> started<00:06:18.729> with<00:06:19.030> our<00:06:19.060> core<00:06:19.450> group<00:06:19.479> of

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 
think it started with our core group of

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.940 
think it started with our core group of
guys<00:06:19.870> and<00:06:20.139> everybody<00:06:20.229> else<00:06:20.620> is<00:06:20.740> kind<00:06:20.830> of

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:20.950 
guys and everybody else is kind of

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:24.060 
guys and everybody else is kind of
falling<00:06:21.840> how<00:06:22.840> hard<00:06:23.110> is<00:06:23.260> it<00:06:23.290> the<00:06:23.500> building<00:06:23.830> I

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.070 
falling how hard is it the building I

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.770 
falling how hard is it the building I
chemistry<00:06:24.610> with<00:06:24.760> the<00:06:24.880> new<00:06:25.000> group<00:06:25.270> is<00:06:25.450> it<00:06:25.570> is

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:25.780 
chemistry with the new group is it is

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.900 
chemistry with the new group is it is
this<00:06:25.930> something<00:06:26.200> we<00:06:26.260> can<00:06:26.440> it's<00:06:27.160> already<00:06:27.669> well

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:27.910 
this something we can it's already well

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:29.909 
this something we can it's already well
underway<00:06:28.240> or<00:06:28.600> it<00:06:29.050> really<00:06:29.350> depends<00:06:29.800> on

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:29.919 
underway or it really depends on

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:32.700 
underway or it really depends on
individuals<00:06:30.639> and<00:06:30.970> what<00:06:31.450> they're<00:06:31.690> about<00:06:32.080> and<00:06:32.500> I

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:32.710 
individuals and what they're about and I

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.909 
individuals and what they're about and I
think<00:06:32.950> with<00:06:33.070> this<00:06:33.220> team<00:06:33.430> you<00:06:33.610> got<00:06:33.729> great<00:06:34.030> guys

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:34.919 
think with this team you got great guys

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:37.350 
think with this team you got great guys
everybody's<00:06:35.919> down<00:06:36.070> to<00:06:36.220> earth<00:06:36.370> and<00:06:36.700> get<00:06:37.270> it

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 
everybody's down to earth and get it

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.300 
everybody's down to earth and get it
gets<00:06:37.690> along<00:06:37.960> with<00:06:38.110> each<00:06:38.260> other<00:06:38.440> you<00:06:39.100> know<00:06:39.220> if

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:39.310 
gets along with each other you know if

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.850 
gets along with each other you know if
you<00:06:39.430> had<00:06:39.580> guys<00:06:39.820> that<00:06:39.880> were<00:06:40.440> not<00:06:41.440> such<00:06:41.620> great

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:41.860 
you had guys that were not such great

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.620 
you had guys that were not such great
guys<00:06:42.039> the<00:06:42.280> chemistry<00:06:42.669> would<00:06:42.789> be<00:06:42.940> messed<00:06:43.419> up

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:43.630 
guys the chemistry would be messed up

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.770 
guys the chemistry would be messed up
but<00:06:43.900> with<00:06:44.350> with<00:06:44.800> these<00:06:45.090> these<00:06:46.090> core<00:06:46.510> group<00:06:46.690> of
