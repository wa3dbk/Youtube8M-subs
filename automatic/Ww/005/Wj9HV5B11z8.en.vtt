00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:14.820
 greetings from subscribers as well as 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.539
 You can see and we have risk that in the 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.430
 truth is a game of an off right in English 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:25.080
 when it was first released 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.340
 called times that I believe to be something 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:33.420
 as risk 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:36.860
 but right to run risk so good risk 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.140
 You can see there we have is version 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.860
 Portuguese in the Portuguese case because 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.379
 Portuguese of Portugal 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:52.410
 anahi apparently Russian English French 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:54.360
 German Spanish Dutch and protected from 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.800
 So, here's the Portuguese from 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:03.769
 portal is to see is the second in this series of 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:07.439
 because it has monopoly and now has 1 ens 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:11.640
 It's true that I'm particularly 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:19.170
 I really like this game. 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:24.540
 to leave the board when the hasbro is 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:30.090
 releasing together with the in truth all 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:31.380
 are dams released for xbox a well 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.009
 cool huh 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.250
 so who never wanted to play with an inter 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.990
 activity or monopoly in the monopoly 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:45.330
 So we help in the middle of the channel. 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:48.510
 very cool man, look, this is it 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.300
 what madness looks only contextualizes saint 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.250
 They put here involving problems 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.750
 Environmental might come with is the increase 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.870
 at the sea level 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.580
 Local conflicts are spreading 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.040
 to neighboring countries 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.280
 I as a geography teacher see this. 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.360
 is pure geopolitics came into Nelmo 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.570
 pure geopolitical war 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.570
 very interesting, right? 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.650
 there they used global forces and 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.920
 I particularly think that it would be a man 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:29.660
 right 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:29.660
 Hey, look at this, guys. 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:38.690
 Smashing guy, you're fantastic. 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:47.660
 awesome awesome 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:57.870
 good come on, brs 101 ninja and pick me up 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:03:02.610
 and they connect and they already had said that it is 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.800
 Hard to shock anybody cool I like 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.440
 here we have some missions seeing 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.700
 there the eight territories in all destroy 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:14.489
 15 enemy troops in shifts were 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:20.100
 those boxes with the objective not to 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:23.400
 I know the secondary missions and as 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.750
 enter here no players that in a limit 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.510
 and not from hasbro 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.510
 Let's go straight to the game, how's it going? 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.810
 in case you play against others 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:42.630
 players have nothing the first time 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:48.120
 playing here can see it n saw a right 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:50.790
 So let's go straight to the game and that's it. 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.340
 then they continue to play against the 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.550
 yen and other players locally 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.150
 Are you going to play? 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.019
 get 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:03.510
 the hotel that the world conquest is not 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:05.640
 capital secret missions won 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.959
 world would be the whole world as I said 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.170
 he who tomorrow 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:12.090
 The excuse is the world conquest. 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.480
 conquered all the territories to 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.400
 winning would take your mission a lot 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.539
 secret to win needed three more 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.900
 players 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:24.389
 I do not know if you can play against the machine. 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.000
 and all opponents' capitals for 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:29.430
 win needed 31 more players 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.100
 the lease of territories automatic or 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:35.570
 manual for you to choose where 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:38.580
 will know its territory rules of 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.260
 fortification with you fortifier 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.050
 any allied territories is 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.340
 adjacent 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.710
 then it would not have that issue of 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.180
 border now already feels the border 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.280
 border understood 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.780
 I'm going back here for you to see the continuum 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.720
 for example has a territory that I 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:58.590
 Can I jump to another territory? 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:01.620
 away from me in the adjoining I can only jump 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:06.320
 It is for another territory that is is do 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.320
 border in the territory to which I am 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:19.810
