00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.990 

now<00:02:57.470> guess<00:02:57.769> by<00:02:57.980> now<00:02:58.189> you<00:02:58.250> should<00:02:58.610> understand

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
now guess by now you should understand

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.270 
now guess by now you should understand
why<00:02:59.239> you<00:02:59.299> do<00:02:59.659> not<00:02:59.810> want<00:03:00.049> to<00:03:00.140> use<00:03:00.349> regular<00:03:00.860> base

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
why you do not want to use regular base

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.069 
why you do not want to use regular base
simply<00:03:01.879> because<00:03:02.150> it<00:03:02.329> will<00:03:02.480> not<00:03:02.659> handle<00:03:02.930> the

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
simply because it will not handle the

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:03.550 
simply because it will not handle the
heat

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
heat

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.390 
heat
or<00:03:03.739> the<00:03:03.860> boiling<00:03:04.040> process<00:03:05.799> and<00:03:06.799> basically

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
or the boiling process and basically

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.420 
or the boiling process and basically
just<00:03:07.610> let<00:03:07.849> it<00:03:07.909> boil<00:03:08.090> for<00:03:08.329> a<00:03:08.420> while<00:03:09.099> that<00:03:10.099> I

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
just let it boil for a while that I

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.009 
just let it boil for a while that I
can't<00:03:10.970> give<00:03:11.120> you<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.360> exact<00:03:11.629> time<00:03:11.870> because

camping you would actually take that

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.900 
camping you would actually take that
take<00:05:34.930> it<00:05:35.050> off<00:05:35.139> the<00:05:35.260> heat<00:05:35.410> take<00:05:35.650> off<00:05:35.830> a<00:05:35.860> fire<00:05:36.130> so

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
take it off the heat take off a fire so

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.279 
take it off the heat take off a fire so
here's<00:05:37.180> where<00:05:37.270> they<00:05:37.510> look<00:05:37.690> and<00:05:37.810> slide<00:05:38.110> this

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289 
here's where they look and slide this

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:46.330 
here's where they look and slide this
over<00:05:38.440> to<00:05:38.620> the<00:05:38.710> plate

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:54.589 

and<00:05:47.340> we'll<00:05:47.580> take<00:05:47.819> this<00:05:47.910> back<00:05:48.120> up<00:05:53.270> get<00:05:54.270> the<00:05:54.389> bag
