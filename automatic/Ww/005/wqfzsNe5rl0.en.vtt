00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.210 
i did break one of my favorites that i
want<00:01:43.970> a<00:01:44.060> bit<00:01:44.210> on<00:01:44.390> a<00:01:44.630> bells<00:01:44.930> beach<00:01:45.200> and<00:01:45.530> that<00:01:46.130> was

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
want a bit on a bells beach and that was

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.609 
want a bit on a bells beach and that was
a<00:01:46.280> bummer<00:01:46.430> i<00:01:46.640> took<00:01:46.880> it<00:01:46.940> to<00:01:47.060> Tahiti<00:01:47.750> and<00:01:48.020> i<00:01:48.470> broke

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
a bummer i took it to Tahiti and i broke

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.200 
a bummer i took it to Tahiti and i broke
it<00:01:48.680> there<00:01:48.920> so<00:01:49.130> it's<00:01:49.250> quite<00:01:49.369> understandable<00:01:49.580> we

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
it there so it's quite understandable we

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.380 
it there so it's quite understandable we
can<00:01:50.390> design<00:01:50.600> boards<00:01:51.640> suited<00:01:52.640> for<00:01:52.880> bells<00:01:53.060> bowl

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
can design boards suited for bells bowl

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.999 
can design boards suited for bells bowl
and<00:01:53.780> then<00:01:53.840> you<00:01:53.960> can<00:01:54.080> also<00:01:54.200> design<00:01:54.500> one<00:01:54.830> that's

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
and then you can also design one that's

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.609 
and then you can also design one that's
more<00:01:55.220> suited<00:01:55.250> to<00:01:55.550> j-bay<00:01:55.840> and<00:01:56.840> then<00:01:57.080> trestles

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
more suited to j-bay and then trestles

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.260 
more suited to j-bay and then trestles
is<00:01:57.770> different<00:01:58.429> again<00:01:58.490> because<00:01:58.940> you<00:01:59.060> know<00:01:59.149> the

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
is different again because you know the

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.300 
is different again because you know the
waves<00:01:59.450> move<00:02:00.140> it<00:02:00.289> a<00:02:00.320> little<00:02:00.350> bit<00:02:00.679> slower<00:02:00.950> speed

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
waves move it a little bit slower speed

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.740 
waves move it a little bit slower speed
and<00:02:01.610> for<00:02:02.060> me<00:02:02.210> I<00:02:02.539> kind<00:02:03.380> of<00:02:03.470> ride<00:02:04.210> the<00:02:05.210> same<00:02:05.479> board

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
and for me I kind of ride the same board

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.620 
and for me I kind of ride the same board
in<00:02:05.899> all<00:02:06.320> places<00:02:06.440> really<00:02:07.070> one<00:02:07.729> thing<00:02:07.910> it<00:02:08.060> feel

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
in all places really one thing it feel

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.540 
in all places really one thing it feel
immediately<00:02:09.259> it<00:02:09.500> feels<00:02:09.860> good<00:02:10.009> to<00:02:10.070> be<00:02:10.160> is<00:02:10.429> if

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
immediately it feels good to be is if

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.670 
immediately it feels good to be is if
it's<00:02:10.670> balanced<00:02:11.060> really<00:02:11.300> nice<00:02:11.480> and<00:02:11.840> as<00:02:12.320> well<00:02:12.470> as

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
it's balanced really nice and as well as

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.610 
it's balanced really nice and as well as
the<00:02:12.860> volumes<00:02:13.280> distribution<00:02:14.239> is<00:02:14.330> fun<00:02:14.620> but

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
the volumes distribution is fun but

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.590 
the volumes distribution is fun but
looks<00:02:16.010> nice<00:02:16.220> like<00:02:16.250> a<00:02:16.519> double<00:02:16.880> state<00:02:17.090> speak<00:02:17.390> for

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
looks nice like a double state speak for

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.030 
looks nice like a double state speak for
too<00:02:17.750> long<00:02:17.959> you<00:02:18.230> kind<00:02:18.440> of<00:02:18.500> just<00:02:18.680> tapers

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
too long you kind of just tapers

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.330 
too long you kind of just tapers
perfectly

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
perfectly

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.130 
perfectly
trying<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:20.790> look<00:02:20.879> at<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.090> that's<00:02:21.959> one<00:02:22.110> thing

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140
