tightening<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.649> screw<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:37.309> thought<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.340> lot

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
tightening the screw I thought a lot

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.280 
tightening the screw I thought a lot
about<00:00:38.670> how<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.090> mount<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.600> camera<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:40.170> the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
about how to mount the camera to the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.889 
about how to mount the camera to the
helmet<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:41.270> didn't<00:00:42.270> want<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.510> drill<00:00:42.690> any<00:00:42.870> holes

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
helmet I didn't want to drill any holes

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.350 
helmet I didn't want to drill any holes
in<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.620> helmet<00:00:43.950> because<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.670> was<00:00:44.820> sacrifice

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
in the helmet because that was sacrifice

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.750 
in the helmet because that was sacrifice
its<00:00:45.719> structure<00:00:46.410> in<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:47.100> event<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.550> crash

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
its structure in the event of a crash

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.340 
its structure in the event of a crash
and<00:00:48.260> I<00:00:49.260> didn't<00:00:49.739> have<00:00:49.860> any<00:00:50.010> straps<00:00:50.399> or<00:00:51.350> adhesive

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
and I didn't have any straps or adhesive

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.209 
and I didn't have any straps or adhesive
type<00:00:52.649> material<00:00:53.390> to<00:00:54.390> mount<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.649> camera<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.129> the

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
type material to mount the camera to the

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.900 
type material to mount the camera to the
helmet<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:57.480> what<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:57.750> decided<00:00:58.230> on<00:00:58.469> was<00:00:58.910> drilling

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
helmet so what I decided on was drilling

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.700 
helmet so what I decided on was drilling
a<00:01:00.140> 5/16<00:01:01.140> inch<00:01:01.350> hole<00:01:01.590> in<00:01:01.910> the<00:01:02.910> face<00:01:03.120> shield<00:01:03.710> so

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
a 5/16 inch hole in the face shield so

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.039 
a 5/16 inch hole in the face shield so
that<00:01:04.979> when<00:01:05.220> it's<00:01:05.729> flipped<00:01:06.090> up<00:01:06.299> it's<00:01:06.780> in<00:01:06.960> the

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
that when it's flipped up it's in the

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.130 
that when it's flipped up it's in the
correct<00:01:07.200> position<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:08.040> mount<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.760> camera<00:01:09.140> the

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
correct position to mount the camera the

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.219 
correct position to mount the camera the
disadvantages<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.100> this<00:01:11.280> are<00:01:11.780> you<00:01:12.780> have<00:01:12.990> a

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
disadvantages to this are you have a

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.760 
disadvantages to this are you have a
hole<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.710> your<00:01:13.830> face<00:01:14.430> shield<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.140> also<00:01:16.140> that

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
hole in your face shield and also that

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.640 
hole in your face shield and also that
you<00:01:17.070> can't<00:01:17.369> film<00:01:17.790> with<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.930> face<00:01:19.110> shield<00:01:19.350> down

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
you can't film with the face shield down

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.230 
you can't film with the face shield down
so<00:01:19.950> you'd<00:01:20.100> have<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.250> wear<00:01:20.490> goggles<00:01:20.670> or<00:01:21.060> just

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
so you'd have to wear goggles or just

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.200 
so you'd have to wear goggles or just
ride<00:01:21.450> with<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:22.409> face<00:01:22.650> shield<00:01:22.920> up<00:01:23.189> but<00:01:23.970> in<00:01:24.060> my

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
ride with the face shield up but in my

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.100 
ride with the face shield up but in my
case<00:01:24.710> this<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.770> just<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:27.090> second<00:01:27.659> helmet<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.049> I

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
case this is just a second helmet that I

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.499 
case this is just a second helmet that I
have<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:29.960> it<00:01:30.960> was<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.650> free<00:01:32.180> project<00:01:33.180> because<00:01:33.479> I

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
have and it was a free project because I

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.600 
have and it was a free project because I
already<00:01:33.840> had<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.140> nuts<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.470> bolts<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:35.579> I

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
already had the nuts and bolts so I

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.969 
already had the nuts and bolts so I
decided<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.090> go<00:01:36.540> for<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:37.790> drilled<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.880> hole

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
decided to go for it I drilled the hole

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.850 
decided to go for it I drilled the hole
about<00:01:40.979> 3/16<00:01:41.880> inch<00:01:42.090> down<00:01:42.509> from<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:43.140> top<00:01:43.290> edge

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
about 3/16 inch down from the top edge

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.630 
about 3/16 inch down from the top edge
of<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.490> face<00:01:44.939> shield<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.509> didn't<00:01:45.960> want<00:01:46.140> to

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
of the face shield I didn't want to

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.429 
of the face shield I didn't want to
drill<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.759> too<00:01:48.210> high<00:01:48.479> because<00:01:48.840> then<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.290> might

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
drill it too high because then it might

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.230 
drill it too high because then it might
crack<00:01:49.799> but<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.310> didn't<00:01:50.610> want<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.790> drill<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.090> too

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
crack but I didn't want to drill it too

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.690 
crack but I didn't want to drill it too
low<00:01:51.450> because<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.799> don't<00:01:53.100> want<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.340> hole<00:01:53.490> right

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
low because I don't want to hole right

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.090 
low because I don't want to hole right
in<00:01:53.820> front<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.090> my<00:01:54.180> nose<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:56.659> drilled<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.750> with

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
in front of my nose I drilled it with

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.429 
in front of my nose I drilled it with
the<00:01:59.100> face<00:01:59.340> shield<00:01:59.610> up<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.960> piece<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.170> metal

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
the face shield up and a piece of metal

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.080 
the face shield up and a piece of metal
slid<00:02:01.920> underneath<00:02:02.310> here<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:02.969> that<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:03.600> wouldn't

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
slid underneath here so that I wouldn't

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.880 
slid underneath here so that I wouldn't
drill<00:02:06.090> into<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.420> helmet<00:02:06.630> by<00:02:07.469> mistake

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.740 

after<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:12.010> hole<00:02:12.159> is<00:02:12.340> drilled<00:02:12.519> I<00:02:12.879> can<00:02:13.420> insert

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
after the hole is drilled I can insert

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:21.420 
after the hole is drilled I can insert
the<00:02:14.019> bolt<00:02:14.290> from<00:02:14.799> the<00:02:14.920> other<00:02:15.790> side<00:02:18.629> and<00:02:20.430> after

the bolt from the other side and after

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
the bolt from the other side and after
the<00:02:21.549> bolt<00:02:21.760> is<00:02:22.349> installed<00:02:23.349> I<00:02:23.730> can<00:02:24.730> put<00:02:25.060> on<00:02:25.209> a

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
the bolt is installed I can put on a

the bolt is installed I can put on a
washer<00:02:26.170> and<00:02:26.739> a<00:02:28.799> nut<00:02:32.909> and<00:02:33.959> then<00:02:34.959> I'll<00:02:35.079> tighten

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
washer and a nut and then I'll tighten

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:42.080 
washer and a nut and then I'll tighten
this<00:02:35.650> nut<00:02:36.299> so<00:02:37.299> that<00:02:37.569> the<00:02:37.690> bolt<00:02:37.900> is<00:02:38.310> secure<00:02:39.310> I

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.089 

can<00:02:43.090> use<00:02:43.209> a<00:02:43.239> screwdriver<00:02:43.540> to<00:02:43.930> access<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.890> bolt

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 
can use a screwdriver to access the bolt

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:47.940 
can use a screwdriver to access the bolt
from<00:02:45.579> the<00:02:45.700> back<00:02:45.910> side<00:02:46.269> and<00:02:46.690> a<00:02:47.650> wrench<00:02:47.859> to

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
tighten it on the front I'm just making

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.080 
tighten it on the front I'm just making
this<00:02:50.709> snug<00:02:51.129> I<00:02:51.340> don't<00:02:51.489> want<00:02:51.640> to<00:02:51.700> torque<00:02:51.940> it<00:02:52.030> down

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
this snug I don't want to torque it down

00:02:52.090 --> 00:03:03.630 
this snug I don't want to torque it down
too<00:02:52.450> much<00:02:52.629> or<00:02:52.840> it'll<00:02:52.959> crack<00:02:53.920> my<00:02:54.359> face<00:02:55.359> shield

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:10.360 

the<00:03:04.640> next<00:03:04.970> step<00:03:05.180> is<00:03:05.900> to<00:03:08.530> install<00:03:09.530> the<00:03:09.950> second

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
the next step is to install the second

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.360 
the next step is to install the second
nut<00:03:10.810> this<00:03:11.810> one<00:03:12.050> has<00:03:12.260> one<00:03:12.920> side<00:03:13.220> that's<00:03:13.900> flat<00:03:14.900> on

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
nut this one has one side that's flat on

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:28.180 
nut this one has one side that's flat on
stall<00:03:16.370> that<00:03:16.640> side<00:03:17.030> up<00:03:22.630> and<00:03:23.630> then<00:03:26.890> just<00:03:27.890> put<00:03:28.069> the

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
stall that side up and then just put the

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:35.770 
stall that side up and then just put the
camera<00:03:28.430> on<00:03:30.310> and<00:03:31.810> I'll<00:03:32.810> tighten<00:03:33.440> up<00:03:34.510> the<00:03:35.510> nut

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
camera on and I'll tighten up the nut

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:50.170 
camera on and I'll tighten up the nut
underneath<00:03:38.650> to<00:03:39.650> secure<00:03:39.830> the<00:03:40.130> camera<00:03:49.180> this

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
underneath to secure the camera this

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.640 
underneath to secure the camera this
doesn't<00:03:50.569> need<00:03:50.630> to<00:03:50.750> be<00:03:50.870> extremely<00:03:51.260> tight

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
doesn't need to be extremely tight

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:58.229 
doesn't need to be extremely tight
either<00:03:51.890> we're<00:03:52.610> dealing<00:03:52.910> with<00:03:53.019> plastic<00:03:54.019> here

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:04.270 

once<00:03:59.239> the<00:03:59.420> camera<00:03:59.810> is<00:03:59.840> snug<00:04:02.799> you<00:04:03.799> can<00:04:03.980> flip<00:04:04.250> up

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
once the camera is snug you can flip up

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:13.150 
once the camera is snug you can flip up
the<00:04:04.430> visor<00:04:10.209> and<00:04:11.209> in<00:04:11.480> my<00:04:11.630> case

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
the visor and in my case

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.400 
the visor and in my case
it's<00:04:13.850> the<00:04:14.120> correct<00:04:15.130> angle<00:04:16.130> for<00:04:16.700> filming<00:04:17.120> in

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
it's the correct angle for filming in

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:23.410 
it's the correct angle for filming in
this<00:04:18.410> position<00:04:19.060> but<00:04:20.060> it<00:04:20.209> can<00:04:20.360> be<00:04:20.450> adjusted<00:04:22.420> if

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420 
this position but it can be adjusted if

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:29.050 
this position but it can be adjusted if
the<00:04:23.690> need<00:04:23.900> arises<00:04:26.140> so<00:04:27.140> this<00:04:27.350> was<00:04:27.560> a<00:04:28.060> cheap

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
the need arises so this was a cheap

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.660 
the need arises so this was a cheap
alternative<00:04:29.240> to<00:04:29.960> buying<00:04:30.140> a<00:04:30.530> camera<00:04:31.460> mount

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.670 
alternative to buying a camera mount

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.480 
alternative to buying a camera mount
because<00:04:32.480> I<00:04:32.630> didn't<00:04:32.960> mind<00:04:33.370> defacing<00:04:34.370> this

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
because I didn't mind defacing this

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.200 
because I didn't mind defacing this
helmet<00:04:34.700> a<00:04:34.880> little<00:04:35.120> bit<00:04:36.490> let's<00:04:37.490> try<00:04:37.790> it<00:04:37.880> out<00:04:37.970> and

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
helmet a little bit let's try it out and

00:04:38.210 --> 00:07:43.330 
helmet a little bit let's try it out and
see<00:04:38.600> how<00:04:38.720> it<00:04:38.870> works

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:43.340 

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.670 

well<00:07:44.340> that<00:07:44.550> was<00:07:44.730> exciting<00:07:45.560> thanks<00:07:46.560> for
