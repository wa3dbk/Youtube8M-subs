the<00:05:26.650> answer<00:05:26.830> with<00:05:27.400> a<00:05:27.430> cute<00:05:27.820> little<00:05:27.850> bicycle

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
the answer with a cute little bicycle

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.750 
the answer with a cute little bicycle
and<00:05:29.610> I<00:05:30.610> think<00:05:31.120> this<00:05:31.330> is<00:05:31.600> so<00:05:32.070> cute<00:05:33.070> and<00:05:33.370> then<00:05:33.520> the

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
and I think this is so cute and then the

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:39.360 
and I think this is so cute and then the
back<00:05:35.310> is<00:05:36.310> like<00:05:37.180> see-through<00:05:37.630> so<00:05:38.470> I'd<00:05:39.010> probably

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
back is like see-through so I'd probably

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.140 
back is like see-through so I'd probably
wear<00:05:39.669> a<00:05:39.850> t-shirt<00:05:40.330> under<00:05:40.600> it<00:05:41.550> to<00:05:42.550> show<00:05:42.880> you<00:05:42.940> the

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
wear a t-shirt under it to show you the

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.140 
wear a t-shirt under it to show you the
back<00:05:43.330> of<00:05:43.360> it<00:05:43.660> so<00:05:44.169> the<00:05:44.380> back<00:05:44.530> of<00:05:44.740> these<00:05:44.950> just<00:05:45.520> our

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
back of it so the back of these just our

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.050 
back of it so the back of these just our
normal<00:05:46.330> hair<00:05:46.780> okay<00:05:47.110> what<00:05:47.290> a<00:05:47.320> Rea<00:05:47.500> don't<00:05:47.710> care

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
normal hair okay what a Rea don't care

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.000 
normal hair okay what a Rea don't care
so<00:05:49.060> yeah<00:05:49.210> this<00:05:49.450> is<00:05:49.510> the<00:05:49.750> back<00:05:50.080> which<00:05:50.470> I<00:05:50.680> think

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.010 
so yeah this is the back which I think

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:53.760 
so yeah this is the back which I think
will<00:05:51.190> go<00:05:51.419> adorable<00:05:52.419> with<00:05:52.630> any<00:05:53.050> of<00:05:53.530> those

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
will go adorable with any of those

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.740 
will go adorable with any of those
shorts<00:05:54.160> probably<00:05:54.910> most<00:05:55.150> likely<00:05:55.330> the<00:05:55.600> black

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
shorts probably most likely the black

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:04.080 
shorts probably most likely the black
ones<00:05:56.020> or<00:05:56.320> the<00:05:56.950> pink<00:05:57.190> ones<00:05:59.490> and<00:06:00.490> then<00:06:01.060> I<00:06:02.880> got<00:06:03.880> the

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
ones or the pink ones and then I got the

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.380 
ones or the pink ones and then I got the
super<00:06:04.720> duper<00:06:05.380> cute<00:06:05.710> dress

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:07.390

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.570 
super duper cute dress
um<00:06:08.390> I<00:06:09.200> know<00:06:09.620> it<00:06:09.800> probably<00:06:09.950> doesn't<00:06:10.160> look<00:06:10.430> like

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
um I know it probably doesn't look like

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.930 
um I know it probably doesn't look like
it<00:06:10.700> fit<00:06:11.030> maybe<00:06:11.300> but<00:06:11.540> does<00:06:11.890> it<00:06:12.890> has<00:06:13.070> this<00:06:13.250> really

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940 
it fit maybe but does it has this really

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.000 
it fit maybe but does it has this really
cute<00:06:14.210> cut<00:06:14.540> out<00:06:14.660> in<00:06:14.900> the<00:06:14.930> front
