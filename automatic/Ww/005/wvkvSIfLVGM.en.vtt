here<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:27.060> can<00:00:27.180> move<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.420> farther<00:00:27.630> away<00:00:27.840> or

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
here you can move it farther away or

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.169 
here you can move it farther away or
closer<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.470> your<00:00:28.650> face<00:00:28.910> but<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:29.970> really

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
muzzle is the technology in the sides of

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.110 
muzzle is the technology in the sides of
it<00:00:35.760> here<00:00:35.910> it's<00:00:36.480> magnetic<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.469> comes<00:00:37.710> right

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
it here it's magnetic and it comes right

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.639 
it here it's magnetic and it comes right
off<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.420> pull<00:00:39.629> up<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.020> away<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.350> it'll<00:00:40.559> come

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
off you pull up and away and it'll come

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.350 
off you pull up and away and it'll come
off<00:00:40.739> but<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.070> neat<00:00:41.250> thing<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:42.000> don't<00:00:42.270> have

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
off but the neat thing is you don't have

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.850 
off but the neat thing is you don't have
to<00:00:42.570> put<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.780> back<00:00:42.870> on<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.200> same<00:00:43.379> way<00:00:43.620> it's

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
to put it back on the same way it's

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.160 
to put it back on the same way it's
magnetic<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.579> it'll<00:00:44.910> actually<00:00:45.030> push<00:00:45.480> back

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
magnetic and it'll actually push back

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.799 
magnetic and it'll actually push back
into<00:00:46.829> there<00:00:47.820> without<00:00:48.000> raising<00:00:48.450> up<00:00:48.570> over<00:00:48.719> the

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
into there without raising up over the

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.479 
into there without raising up over the
top<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.230> get<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.410> off<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:50.010> have<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.190> go<00:00:50.309> up

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
top so to get it off you have to go up

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.549 
top so to get it off you have to go up
and<00:00:50.640> out<00:00:50.760> heat<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.480> back<00:00:51.600> on<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:52.260> have<00:00:52.350> gloves

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
and out heat it back on you have gloves

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.439 
and out heat it back on you have gloves
on<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:53.190> know<00:00:53.309> you're<00:00:53.460> on<00:00:53.550> your<00:00:53.640> bike<00:00:53.789> he's<00:00:54.300> got

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
to get it close to it snaps right back

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.920 
to get it close to it snaps right back
on<00:00:56.449> the<00:00:57.449> muzzle<00:00:58.309> just<00:00:59.309> besides<00:00:59.699> being<00:01:00.210> badass
