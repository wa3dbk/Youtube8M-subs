word up how long it takes but you have
to<00:01:17.230> bear<00:01:17.350> in<00:01:17.410> mind<00:01:17.650> that<00:01:17.830> this<00:01:18.100> notebook<00:01:18.510> comes

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
to bear in mind that this notebook comes

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.840 
to bear in mind that this notebook comes
with<00:01:20.170> 1<00:01:20.380> gig<00:01:20.590> of<00:01:20.680> ram<00:01:20.740> however<00:01:21.400> I<00:01:21.490> have

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
with 1 gig of ram however I have

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.200 
with 1 gig of ram however I have
installed<00:01:22.840> two<00:01:23.470> legal<00:01:23.800> RAM<00:01:23.979> in<00:01:24.340> his<00:01:24.520> notebooks

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
installed two legal RAM in his notebooks

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.920 
installed two legal RAM in his notebooks
which<00:01:25.590> would<00:01:26.590> cost<00:01:26.860> about<00:01:27.130> 10<00:01:27.340> pound<00:01:27.930> so

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
which would cost about 10 pound so

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.330 
which would cost about 10 pound so
here's<00:01:29.140> where<00:01:29.350> they<00:01:29.590> open<00:01:29.860> fairly<00:01:30.160> quickly

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
here's where they open fairly quickly

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.520 
here's where they open fairly quickly
and<00:01:30.670> just<00:01:31.060> have<00:01:31.540> something<00:01:33.509> people<00:01:34.530> works

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
and just have something people works

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.940 
and just have something people works
okay<00:01:35.860> and<00:01:35.890> you<00:01:36.250> know<00:01:36.340> there's<00:01:36.820> no<00:01:37.680> too<00:01:38.680> much<00:01:38.830> of

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
okay and you know there's no too much of

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:48.560 
okay and you know there's no too much of
a<00:01:39.009> lag<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:40.270> it's<00:01:40.390> okay<00:01:44.520> now

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:56.780 

just<00:01:49.570> move<00:01:49.810> into<00:01:49.960> the<00:01:50.290> internet<00:01:51.280> browsing

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.420 

so<00:01:57.330> let's<00:01:57.780> go<00:01:58.320> with<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.650> conventional<00:01:59.220> to

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
so let's go with the conventional to

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.310 
so let's go with the conventional to
next<00:01:59.640> Laura<00:02:01.100> opened<00:02:02.100> up<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:03.090> this<00:02:04.050> is<00:02:04.230> how

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
next Laura opened up and this is how

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.860 
next Laura opened up and this is how
long<00:02:04.470> with<00:02:04.650> eggs<00:02:04.830> and<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:06.570> internet

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
long with eggs and the internet

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.520 
long with eggs and the internet
connection<00:02:07.110> we're<00:02:07.440> using<00:02:07.620> is<00:02:07.950> about<00:02:08.899> 30<00:02:09.899> mega

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
connection we're using is about 30 mega

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.950 
connection we're using is about 30 mega
plot<00:02:10.770> megabytes<00:02:11.280> per<00:02:11.370> second<00:02:13.490> so<00:02:14.750> this<00:02:15.750> is

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
plot megabytes per second so this is

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.850 
plot megabytes per second so this is
with<00:02:16.410> one<00:02:16.590> tab<00:02:16.800> open<00:02:17.160> just<00:02:17.510> type<00:02:18.510> in<00:02:19.460> anything

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
with one tab open just type in anything

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.480 
with one tab open just type in anything
generally<00:02:22.860> such<00:02:23.130> is<00:02:23.430> quite<00:02:23.790> fast<00:02:25.280> no<00:02:26.280> much

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
generally such is quite fast no much

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:34.720 
generally such is quite fast no much
time<00:02:26.730> taking<00:02:29.180> despite<00:02:30.180> being<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.780> notebook<00:02:31.200> of

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:46.760 

the<00:02:35.730> open<00:02:35.970> two<00:02:36.300> tabs<00:02:36.570> up<00:02:41.300> up<00:02:42.300> there

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:58.060 

wait<00:02:47.370> a<00:02:47.400> second<00:02:50.150> you<00:02:51.150> go<00:02:52.340> let<00:02:53.340> me<00:02:53.370> open<00:02:53.520> up<00:02:53.910> here

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.750 

so<00:02:59.070> okay<00:02:59.340> with<00:02:59.850> two<00:03:00.030> tabs<00:03:00.240> open<00:03:01.370> let's<00:03:02.370> try<00:03:02.610> one

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
so okay with two tabs open let's try one

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.310 
so okay with two tabs open let's try one
more<00:03:02.790> tab<00:03:03.180> and<00:03:05.630> this<00:03:06.630> time<00:03:06.810> they<00:03:06.930> opened<00:03:07.170> a<00:03:07.200> bit

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
more tab and this time they opened a bit

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:16.460 
more tab and this time they opened a bit
faster<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:09.770> stopping<00:03:10.770> so<00:03:14.990> as<00:03:15.990> you<00:03:16.110> can<00:03:16.230> see<00:03:16.290> I

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
faster and stopping so as you can see I

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.230 
faster and stopping so as you can see I
mean<00:03:16.770> you<00:03:16.830> can<00:03:17.100> browse<00:03:17.760> through<00:03:18.150> different

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
mean you can browse through different

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.260 
mean you can browse through different
tabs<00:03:19.130> it<00:03:20.130> doesn't<00:03:20.550> have<00:03:20.700> too<00:03:20.880> much<00:03:20.940> a<00:03:21.060> problem

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
tabs it doesn't have too much a problem

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:31.250 
tabs it doesn't have too much a problem
and<00:03:23.150> you<00:03:24.150> need<00:03:24.180> to<00:03:24.480> go<00:03:24.660> on<00:03:24.810> YouTube

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.430 

I<00:03:31.290> mean<00:03:31.980> it<00:03:32.099> certainly<00:03:32.310> isn't<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.819> quickest

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
I mean it certainly isn't the quickest

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.839 
I mean it certainly isn't the quickest
but<00:03:36.050> considering<00:03:37.050> the<00:03:38.010> amount<00:03:38.220> of<00:03:38.310> power<00:03:38.519> it

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
but considering the amount of power it

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:48.400 
but considering the amount of power it
has<00:03:39.530> this<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:41.129> job<00:03:41.340> done

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.770 

there<00:03:49.410> you<00:03:49.470> go<00:03:49.560> YouTube<00:03:49.890> loads<00:03:50.129> up<00:03:51.080> and<00:03:52.080> just

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
there you go YouTube loads up and just

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:14.920 
there you go YouTube loads up and just
check<00:03:54.780> this<00:03:54.870> video<00:03:54.989> here

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.740 

so<00:04:15.530> this<00:04:15.709> with<00:04:15.950> three<00:04:16.190> tabs<00:04:16.430> open<00:04:16.850> and<00:04:17.120> now

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
so this with three tabs open and now

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:37.680 
so this with three tabs open and now
it's<00:04:17.930> loading<00:04:18.259> up<00:04:18.320> a<00:04:18.440> video

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:44.280 

it's<00:04:38.690> not<00:04:38.840> the<00:04:38.930> most<00:04:39.080> hot<00:04:39.350> spot<00:04:39.860> okay

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.540
