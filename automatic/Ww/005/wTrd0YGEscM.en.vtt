00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
just wish that they would have the

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.899 
just wish that they would have the
pocket<00:01:30.900> clip<00:01:31.110> would<00:01:31.350> be<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.880> stainless<00:01:32.880> steel

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
pocket clip would be a stainless steel

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.149 
pocket clip would be a stainless steel
you<00:01:33.630> know<00:01:33.750> nice<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.259> shiny<00:01:34.470> instead<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:34.979> black

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
you know nice and shiny instead of black

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.890 
you know nice and shiny instead of black
i<00:01:35.310> think<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:35.670> would<00:01:35.759> match<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.060> bleed<00:01:36.630> a

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
i think that would match the bleed a

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.649 
i think that would match the bleed a
little<00:01:37.500> better<00:01:37.799> but<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.189> know<00:01:38.420> maybe<00:01:39.420> i<00:01:39.570> can

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
little better but you know maybe i can

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.539 
little better but you know maybe i can
get<00:01:39.810> with<00:01:39.990> one<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.350> them<00:01:40.439> buffers<00:01:40.860> or<00:01:41.100> grinders

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
get with one of them buffers or grinders

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.270 
get with one of them buffers or grinders
and<00:01:42.000> try<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.240> make<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:43.140> match<00:01:43.409> later<00:01:44.009> on

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
and try to make that match later on

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.830 
and try to make that match later on
that's<00:01:44.790> not<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.210> important<00:01:45.659> right<00:01:45.689> now

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
that's not that important right now

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.280
