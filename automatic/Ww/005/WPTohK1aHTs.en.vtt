it's I think a certain up to a certain
denomination<00:02:45.400> there's<00:02:45.549> some<00:02:45.700> 20s<00:02:46.120> some<00:02:47.049> more

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
denomination there's some 20s some more

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.699 
denomination there's some 20s some more
ones<00:02:48.989> so<00:02:49.989> this<00:02:50.079> is<00:02:50.230> all<00:02:50.380> the<00:02:50.410> number<00:02:50.950> sides<00:02:52.709> so

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
ones so this is all the number sides so

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.120 
ones so this is all the number sides so
there's<00:02:53.890> ones<00:02:54.750> there's<00:02:55.750> a<00:02:55.840> one<00:02:56.079> there's<00:02:56.980> the

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
there's ones there's a one there's the

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.009 
there's ones there's a one there's the
20s<00:02:57.579> and<00:02:57.880> the<00:02:57.940> 50s<00:02:58.590> and<00:03:00.359> then<00:03:01.359> the<00:03:01.450> other<00:03:01.630> sides

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
20s and the 50s and then the other sides

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.819 
20s and the 50s and then the other sides
now<00:03:02.430> can<00:03:03.430> is<00:03:03.579> that<00:03:03.700> a<00:03:03.850> good<00:03:04.000> enough<00:03:04.120> shot<00:03:04.829> hope

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
now can is that a good enough shot hope

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:12.840 
now can is that a good enough shot hope
so<00:03:06.100> I<00:03:06.660> will<00:03:07.660> flip<00:03:07.870> them<00:03:08.079> I<00:03:11.400> know<00:03:12.400> there's<00:03:12.730> some

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
so I will flip them I know there's some

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.210 
so I will flip them I know there's some
really<00:03:12.880> knowledgeable<00:03:13.690> candy<00:03:14.680> money<00:03:14.920> people

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
the next denominations I'll put those

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.080 
the next denominations I'll put those
off<00:03:30.519> to<00:03:30.700> the<00:03:30.730> side

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
off to the side

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:45.339 
off to the side
this<00:03:32.079> was<00:03:32.260> the<00:03:32.410> 50<00:03:32.950> so<00:03:33.670> let's<00:03:33.850> open<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.239> 50

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:47.630 

now<00:03:46.349> that's<00:03:46.560> interesting<00:03:47.099> because<00:03:47.280> there's

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
now that's interesting because there's

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.720 
now that's interesting because there's
some<00:03:47.989> US<00:03:48.989> money<00:03:49.319> in<00:03:49.530> their<00:03:51.950> quarters<00:03:52.950> you<00:03:53.550> get

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
some US money in their quarters you get

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.390 
some US money in their quarters you get
them<00:03:53.819> all<00:03:54.200> so<00:03:55.200> what<00:03:55.319> I'm<00:03:55.410> sensing<00:03:55.650> here<00:03:56.099> at

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
them all so what I'm sensing here at

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.880 
them all so what I'm sensing here at
this<00:03:56.610> point<00:03:56.940> is<00:03:57.209> there's<00:03:57.989> really<00:03:58.080> no

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
this point is there's really no

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.920 
this point is there's really no
consistency<00:03:59.819> here<00:04:00.209> I<00:04:00.239> was<00:04:00.480> thinking<00:04:00.510> that<00:04:00.810> I

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
consistency here I was thinking that I

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.559 
consistency here I was thinking that I
would<00:04:01.140> have<00:04:01.290> a<00:04:01.319> box<00:04:01.650> of<00:04:01.890> the<00:04:02.010> same<00:04:02.250> coins<00:04:02.970> and

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
would have a box of the same coins and

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.759 
would have a box of the same coins and
now<00:04:04.200> I<00:04:04.230> have<00:04:04.620> some<00:04:05.340> US<00:04:05.700> quarters<00:04:06.269> in<00:04:06.450> there<00:04:06.769> and

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
now I have some US quarters in there and

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.710 
now I have some US quarters in there and
they're<00:04:07.980> dated<00:04:08.660> 1993<00:04:10.819> the<00:04:11.819> Eagle<00:04:12.239> on<00:04:12.360> the<00:04:12.390> back

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
they're dated 1993 the Eagle on the back

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.780 
they're dated 1993 the Eagle on the back
and<00:04:13.410> here's<00:04:13.680> some<00:04:13.890> of<00:04:13.920> the<00:04:14.040> ones<00:04:14.280> we<00:04:14.489> had<00:04:14.640> in

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
designs cuz the designs are the same

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:26.570 
designs cuz the designs are the same
there's<00:04:21.239> a<00:04:21.329> 50<00:04:24.169> hmm<00:04:25.169> interesting<00:04:25.620> kind<00:04:26.430> of<00:04:26.520> the

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
there's a 50 hmm interesting kind of the

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.350 
there's a 50 hmm interesting kind of the
same<00:04:26.790> coins<00:04:28.250> but<00:04:29.250> then<00:04:29.460> we<00:04:29.550> add<00:04:29.729> some<00:04:29.760> weird

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
same coins but then we add some weird

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.719 
same coins but then we add some weird
lots<00:04:30.720> of<00:04:30.900> ones<00:04:31.200> in<00:04:31.380> there<00:04:31.560> and<00:04:31.650> only<00:04:31.800> 150<00:04:32.610> in

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
lots of ones in there and only 150 in

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:34.520 
lots of ones in there and only 150 in
the<00:04:32.850> box<00:04:33.139> hmm

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
the box hmm

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.670 
the box hmm
let's<00:04:35.130> push<00:04:35.400> those<00:04:35.639> off<00:04:35.880> to<00:04:36.030> the<00:04:36.060> back<00:04:36.300> now<00:04:36.680> now

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
let's push those off to the back now now

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.860 
let's push those off to the back now now
the<00:04:37.770> plot<00:04:38.100> thickens<00:04:38.610> from<00:04:39.330> what<00:04:39.450> I<00:04:39.479> thought<00:04:39.570> I

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
the plot thickens from what I thought I

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.000 
the plot thickens from what I thought I
was<00:04:40.110> gonna<00:04:40.260> get<00:04:40.530> to<00:04:41.070> what<00:04:41.250> I'm<00:04:41.400> getting<00:04:43.010> and

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
was gonna get to what I'm getting and

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.560 
was gonna get to what I'm getting and
these<00:04:44.250> are<00:04:44.370> made<00:04:44.520> in<00:04:44.760> the<00:04:44.789> Netherlands<00:04:45.539> so

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
these are made in the Netherlands so

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:53.950 
these are made in the Netherlands so
maybe<00:04:45.870> this<00:04:46.050> is<00:04:46.260> uh<00:04:49.280> just<00:04:50.280> how<00:04:50.400> they<00:04:50.550> do<00:04:50.610> it

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.100 

there's<00:04:54.960> 50s<00:04:55.970> does<00:04:56.970> it<00:04:57.150> all<00:04:57.300> total<00:04:57.720> up<00:04:57.870> to<00:04:57.900> a

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
there's 50s does it all total up to a

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.779 
there's 50s does it all total up to a
hundred<00:04:58.590> I<00:04:58.800> don't<00:04:59.190> know<00:04:59.310> cuz<00:04:59.550> you<00:04:59.639> got

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
hundred I don't know cuz you got

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:02.020 
hundred I don't know cuz you got
American<00:05:00.780> money<00:05:00.960> in<00:05:01.110> there

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
American money in there

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:09.260 
American money in there
so<00:05:03.030> here<00:05:03.240> ones<00:05:03.630> 20s<00:05:04.410> a<00:05:06.260> fifty<00:05:07.970> this<00:05:08.970> is<00:05:09.150> the

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
so here ones 20s a fifty this is the

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.950 
so here ones 20s a fifty this is the
hundred-year-old<00:05:09.870> pack<00:05:11.690> I'm<00:05:12.690> really

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
hundred-year-old pack I'm really

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.980 
hundred-year-old pack I'm really
confused

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:23.960 

so<00:05:18.990> nothing<00:05:19.380> different<00:05:19.830> in<00:05:20.100> here<00:05:20.340> I<00:05:22.880> wonder<00:05:23.880> if

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
so nothing different in here I wonder if

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.610 
so nothing different in here I wonder if
it<00:05:24.060> just<00:05:24.180> totals<00:05:24.599> up<00:05:24.750> to<00:05:24.780> a<00:05:24.990> hundred<00:05:25.410> so

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
it just totals up to a hundred so

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.860 
it just totals up to a hundred so
someone<00:05:26.580> else<00:05:26.700> do<00:05:26.849> the<00:05:26.970> math<00:05:27.150> there<00:05:27.419> I<00:05:27.450> can't

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
someone else do the math there I can't

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.270 
someone else do the math there I can't
do<00:05:28.020> the<00:05:28.139> math<00:05:28.910> not<00:05:29.910> right<00:05:30.090> now<00:05:30.240> anyway

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
do the math not right now anyway

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.180 
do the math not right now anyway
so<00:05:32.280> there's<00:05:32.460> the<00:05:32.580> other<00:05:32.610> sides<00:05:33.060> of<00:05:33.300> these

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
so there's the other sides of these

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.029 
so there's the other sides of these
getting<00:05:35.190> a<00:05:35.220> good<00:05:35.400> shot<00:05:36.440> time<00:05:37.440> I<00:05:37.590> try<00:05:37.830> one

10<00:06:35.890> 12<00:06:35.950> 14<00:06:37.470> so<00:06:38.470> that's<00:06:38.680> the<00:06:38.860> 500<00:06:39.730> year<00:06:40.270> old<00:06:40.300> box

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160 
10 12 14 so that's the 500 year old box

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.770 
10 12 14 so that's the 500 year old box
and<00:06:42.160> it's<00:06:42.700> the<00:06:42.820> same<00:06:43.060> coins<00:06:43.390> 50<00:06:43.870> 20s<00:06:44.410> and<00:06:44.950> ones

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:45.780 
and it's the same coins 50 20s and ones

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.090 
and it's the same coins 50 20s and ones
maybe<00:06:46.780> the<00:06:46.990> backs<00:06:47.230> are<00:06:47.380> different<00:06:47.740> on<00:06:47.800> this<00:06:47.890> so

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:48.100 
maybe the backs are different on this so

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.130 
maybe the backs are different on this so
I'm<00:06:48.190> just<00:06:48.370> flipping<00:06:48.580> them<00:06:48.760> over<00:06:48.880> I<00:06:49.240> kind<00:06:50.080> of

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:50.140 
I'm just flipping them over I kind of

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:52.770 
I'm just flipping them over I kind of
have<00:06:50.290> to<00:06:50.410> look<00:06:50.560> later<00:06:50.970> in<00:06:51.970> the<00:06:52.150> video<00:06:52.450> and<00:06:52.720> then

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:52.780 
have to look later in the video and then

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.690 
have to look later in the video and then
large<00:06:52.990> it<00:06:53.260> so<00:06:53.380> I<00:06:53.440> can<00:06:53.680> get<00:06:54.340> a<00:06:54.400> really<00:06:54.580> good

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:54.700 
large it so I can get a really good

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.980 
large it so I can get a really good
perspective<00:06:57.390> when<00:06:58.390> I'm<00:06:58.480> moving<00:06:58.630> around<00:06:58.750> like

00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:58.990 
perspective when I'm moving around like

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:00.120 
perspective when I'm moving around like
this<00:06:59.110> is<00:06:59.290> just<00:06:59.470> so<00:06:59.560> that<00:06:59.710> you<00:06:59.830> can<00:06:59.980> get

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:00.130 
this is just so that you can get

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.580 
this is just so that you can get
different<00:07:01.030> angles<00:07:01.390> and<00:07:01.600> views<00:07:02.020> so<00:07:02.230> that<00:07:02.260> is

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:02.590 
different angles and views so that is

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:06.540 
different angles and views so that is
the<00:07:02.800> 500<00:07:04.170> so<00:07:05.170> what<00:07:05.290> do<00:07:05.380> you<00:07:05.440> think<00:07:05.620> of<00:07:05.710> the<00:07:05.800> 500

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:06.550 
the 500 so what do you think of the 500

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.230 
the 500 so what do you think of the 500
huh<00:07:06.790> not<00:07:07.270> what<00:07:07.420> I<00:07:07.450> was<00:07:07.660> expecting<00:07:07.740> I<00:07:09.120> have<00:07:10.120> them

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:10.240 
huh not what I was expecting I have them

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.560 
huh not what I was expecting I have them
all<00:07:10.360> nicely<00:07:11.200> set<00:07:11.980> out<00:07:12.160> here<00:07:12.490> because<00:07:13.390> it's

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:13.570 
all nicely set out here because it's

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:15.750 
all nicely set out here because it's
still<00:07:13.780> impressive<00:07:14.140> I<00:07:14.500> still<00:07:14.800> like<00:07:15.550> the

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:15.760 
still impressive I still like the

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.060 
still impressive I still like the
individual<00:07:16.390> boxes<00:07:16.870> they're<00:07:17.080> unique<00:07:17.380> the

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:18.070 
individual boxes they're unique the

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.460 
individual boxes they're unique the
coins<00:07:18.370> are<00:07:18.580> really<00:07:18.810> different<00:07:19.810> in<00:07:20.050> regards<00:07:20.410> to

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:20.470 
coins are really different in regards to

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:22.680 
coins are really different in regards to
what<00:07:21.190> you're<00:07:21.430> getting<00:07:21.790> they're<00:07:21.970> all

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:22.690 
what you're getting they're all

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:25.320 
what you're getting they're all
different<00:07:23.200> kinds<00:07:23.740> but<00:07:23.800> it<00:07:24.280> seems<00:07:24.610> like<00:07:24.820> a<00:07:25.030> lot

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:25.330 
different kinds but it seems like a lot

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.240 
different kinds but it seems like a lot
of<00:07:25.480> repeats<00:07:25.990> so<00:07:26.140> I<00:07:26.230> was<00:07:26.350> expecting<00:07:26.770> all<00:07:27.100> these

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:27.250 
of repeats so I was expecting all these

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:30.030 
of repeats so I was expecting all these
to<00:07:27.370> be<00:07:27.490> 20<00:07:27.880> all<00:07:28.300> these<00:07:28.600> to<00:07:28.750> be<00:07:28.870> 50<00:07:29.290> all<00:07:29.650> these<00:07:29.920> to

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:30.040 
to be 20 all these to be 50 all these to

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.800 
to be 20 all these to be 50 all these to
be<00:07:30.130> a<00:07:30.160> hundred<00:07:30.400> and<00:07:30.550> five<00:07:31.120> hundred<00:07:31.180> even

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:31.810 
be a hundred and five hundred even

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.290 
be a hundred and five hundred even
though<00:07:32.020> those<00:07:32.590> denominations<00:07:33.220> may<00:07:33.580> not<00:07:33.820> exist

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:34.300 
though those denominations may not exist

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.780 
though those denominations may not exist

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:36.790 
I was thinking they were gonna do

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.490
