00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.800
 who would like to be an animal keeper who is exactly in the Magdeburg zoo currently 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.330
 two snow leopard babies are waiting for you and you can do that 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.270
 six weeks old small cats look directly into their mouth or they 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.519
 Carefully put on the scale with the action, the zoo wants to donate 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:25.060
 Collecting wildlife conservation project in India Colleague Marina pulls out he has never 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.640
 Wolter offender views behind the scenes Mutti is something 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.480
 nice cuddling lie 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.000
 and know and promote 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.340
 that also belongs to the everyday life of animal keeper Peter Oppermann 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.050
 not on the diet of the little big cats but Michael Anger so one 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.520
 In the next few weeks, they would have to start bracing the financial sector 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.040
 but still it is not mainly promoted one these promoted ones 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.850
 adequate Marshall they are also pretty impossible here you can see yes 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.940
 so far it is quiet in the nursery because the little cats are sleeping 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.350
 still missing but when they are awake then action is announced 

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:05.860
 And this is becoming more and more of the Bauverein from day to day because of course even more 

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:07.370
 because that's open 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.830
 are former First one helped one another or brawls which also for life 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.450
 Form you also have to defend and enforce and that is why 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.000
 something is clear so for two years can now together and who against 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.150
 even small miniskirt cats want to experience up close the can at the zoo now 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.479
 Animal care easy Special book 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.420
 Weighing out all this is possible says school director Kai Perret one can 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.530
 you can scratch 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.990
 sometimes place one can take on the arm 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.350
 Percent of a millennium, of course, the animals are not on the scales 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.870
 you have to take them in the hand 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.350
 So when does the animals get very close and I think it absolutely 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.960
 unique feeling and experience with the action snow and zookeeper 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.140
 is sponsoring a sponsorship project in India the snow leopards are from the 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.409
 threatened extinction 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.009
 so it is important to educate early on the animals that they 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.159
 Kids did it that they learn so playfully we environment looks what's in there 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:02.720
 lives 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.790
 and so, hopefully, the first Grand has been set for 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:07.630
 to protect sustainably
