00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:13.080
 my name is fact 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.910
 I am a plastic artist for training and 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.350
 origami came into my life with a 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.140
 very unexpected thing 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.210
 I was raising children by being bank and one day 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.410
 a co-worker arrived with a 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:28.050
 That 's exactly what this flower is. 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.699
 a lily with a little flower in this yes 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.490
 paperback as soon as your Japanese paper 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.980
 specific to flowers and showed me that 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.870
 she had won this little flower at the point 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.180
 by bus and I was delighted I never had 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.970
 I saw this and decided that I wanted to do 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.970
 and there I was saying that the universe thing 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:48.290
 was very extensive and people 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:51.620
 organists are a very 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:54.480
 very participative very lively 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.280
 collaborator and I was feeling very 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.140
 in this group and I was seeing things 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.900
 wonderful wonderful works and was 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.330
 getting origami is much more than just 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.470
 he has a whole lot of 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.909
 philosophy has people who consider 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.130
 crafts and now I can not look 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.289
 it here and saw something so 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.479
 magic, because the result is 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:18.689
 very magical and I can not see it with 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.259
 a simple handicraft the origin is that 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.060
 thing that there is controversy even ne 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:27.960
 That thing is so China does not 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:31.829
 It's Japan, how did China create the 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.979
 role that faced the role then there is 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.799
 many people say no studies say 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.289
 that thing started there and that japan 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.119
 would have developed the art 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:46.289
 we have a line of organisms that 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:50.880
 people call tourists who only accept 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:53.579
 Folding origami with square sheet no 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.859
 accepts glue and does not accept record 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.380
 now we only have origami folding with 

00:01:55.859 --> 00:02:01.289
 the paper round we have origami 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.139
 folding with the triangular paper with 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.389
 paper has had many 

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:08.100
 many flowers coming out in the pentagon 

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:11.160
 this here for example is done with a 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.660
 single sheet of square paper be 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.439
 record without glue 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.470
 now I'm here already modular ne 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:22.560
 in this one there are 30 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.770
 30 modules plus the little flowers all to 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.470
 You assemble a piece right then we have 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.230
 decorative we have this utility 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.690
 here is an origami box he does not 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.820
 there is a specific role for you 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.730
 doubling is so much that when we start 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.980
 The folding gets so addicted it does not 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.290
 can see a little leaf close to us 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.060
 I was already looking, so I already had meetings. 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.800
 We folded the table cloth 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.820
 restaurant before in that city 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.940
 paper 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:54.050
 so it does not have a specific role 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:57.630
 It's over time as you go. 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:00.360
 working and developing in xii 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.090
 learning more you get to 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.850
 identify which role is best for the 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.690
 we have Japanese paper that paper 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:12.690
 also within the role of the 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.160
 Japanese have a myriad of types of 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.380
 paper has a weight 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.570
 has some specific roles. 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.150
 for flowers they are already stamped 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.670
 to give a beautiful result that is this 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.610
 here it is until a paper stamped it 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.590
 is already suitable for flower, right? 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.510
 so we have the paper stamped on 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.630
 people have the finest papers as well. 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.720
 to make flowers seem to have been then 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:39.420
 with time and with your experience you 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.060
 Try experimenting, and you'll see what 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.700
 it is better because larger parts require the 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.590
 paper weight is tests. 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.690
 which has many works will not be many 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.310
 works you can not use too much paper 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.870
 Thick because it comes in the end you do not 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.610
 can double more 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.680
 so this is all you will learn 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.660
 testing is different than women 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.140
 fold than men fold from a 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.100
 In general, women are very fond of 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.470
 flower utility 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.120
 men are very fond of animals bend 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.700
 the dragons 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.830
 the insects the perfect origami I guess 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.470
 than the one who just made it to 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:16.560
 people get there I believe because 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.810
 reaction of people entering people I 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.269
 I got this is the perfect origami 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.850
 understood the time he shows you what 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:27.930
 you can get the result but the 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:30.120
 people are paper the american paper 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.110
 has a useful life and people so people but it is 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.510
 paper is 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.230
 tel now you also have a cup of 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:40.330
 porcelain owner will last a lifetime 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:43.420
 So it's not supposed to save to use the time. 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.610
 which eventually makes others but the other knows 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.710
 because pleasure in it does not even do 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.750
 other does not produce the other giving of 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.250
 This present is not for life. 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.580
 whole is for you to work this 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.650
 question is also detachment knowing 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.810
 I just get everything, it comes, it goes away. 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:02.320
 fulfilled that role in that period 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:05.350
 ready and gone and was cool 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:08.100
 let's pass between the universe is so 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.100
 large gaps
