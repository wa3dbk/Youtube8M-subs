00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.610
 both welcome pointing to 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:16.030
 a channel today shows how to get here 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:20.200
 the bumper or the ptc sensor 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:22.840
 changes at audi a 6 411 at the 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:31.420
 rear bumper and that is 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:34.540
 actually quite simply we have the pc 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:38.290
 sensor and here it is taking here now 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.120
 one with 10 - and they are three 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:45.969
 screw 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:50.260
 that means this screw this and 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:54.840
 which is in butter 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:58.359
 that would have to unscrew it is 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.030
 page part many pages wrong here 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:06.550
 completely relaxed after doing it here 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:11.799
 these torx screws are making themselves 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:13.509
 some also see this on the page 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:15.729
 I already did that because I did 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:19.590
 only with one hand can work here 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:21.610
 and that's exactly what it's all about 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.979
 can you already see that here 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.490
 Snake is loose then pull here 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:33.549
 just gone 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:42.250
 Back there you see it is dissolving China 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:44.549
 here are of course the screws we 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.549
 see 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.740
 if you, of course, more space 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:02.060
 Of course you need it below 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:04.300
 down the screws also loose 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.300
 do 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.510
 but me personally reached three place 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.630
 now easy to switch s.pc are like that 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:24.080
 because I'm just after that now 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:26.890
 pull forward to see you 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:32.560
 now that you come out already 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.560
 namely, for example, this band now 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.220
 do it here 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:50.380
 and as I said now I come 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:55.299
 actually here already for the pdc sensor 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.299
 and taken that's how we do it now 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:07.890
 that for us there is a small clips 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.090
 so best what it actually if you 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.850
 the complete pc be immediately as 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:32.200
 First and foremost , they are here 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:36.800
 a petition will be here 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:41.240
 here on the side of the bumper so 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:45.680
 a bracket and the clips this 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:51.370
 take out the thick that we can 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.370
 get complete pc sensor animal out 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.500
 so now I have to first the camera 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:12.360
 switch off because I with a hand 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:15.290
 I can not handle it now so patience 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:27.060
 I pulled it out a bit now 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:33.090
 we we take a completely out of the 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:41.370
 we have the complete pc are here 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:43.940
 It's easy to see on the clubs 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.940
 meet up 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:59.900
 loose the old pc sensor the new me 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:04.550
 have now falsely now a 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:06.169
 bought with the angle and exactly the construction 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.680
 I'm still here anyway because we're here 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:11.889
 but quite a lot of room to move 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.889
 and enough
