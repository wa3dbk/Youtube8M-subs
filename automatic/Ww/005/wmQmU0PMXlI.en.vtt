00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.559
 I'm taking a little break on the sleeve 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.210
 32 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.190
 we had more ammunition beaver is 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.320
 death we had fun at the fact quite a lot of 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.760
 zombies in point a taser you the 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.470
 see the pointer before I take 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.489
 two rooms and tickles at that makes them 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:53.540
 a little laugh even when they are in 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:54.680
 flames just before she's her 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.000
 banter and its usefulness the pointing on 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.409
 never know we can invest completed a 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.120
 zombie and they have ammo 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:01.149
 with a little luck or a good taste the 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.610
 head remains after all why not 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.490
 So here you are excuse me for this little 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.600
 parenthesis and placement following adam 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.039
 mp5 case it is still on the wall 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.250
 from the beginning and we do that at the 

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:16.070
 end the mp5 case once it is 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.979
 improved becomes the mp 115 collisions 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.300
 so the p5 ab I really like this 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.710
 weapon already because she's on hard and 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.619
 which allows us to publish the 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.980
 point and you have to improve fight you 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.230
 just win 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.200
 parole or more 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.180
 basic to a bagre focus 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.920
 no more not more crazy and a little more I 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.600
 find and I find damage 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.490
 on this amateur blow she does 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.409
 part of the few pretty much drinking is 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.240
 on the desk 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:46.020
 it is once improved ammunition 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:49.319
 costs 5000 to make it a little expensive 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.069
 to the great pleasure of restocking 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:54.990
 by going to me jeans but it remains that we 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:56.130
 still sees a train of flax 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.270
 with which one can easily do 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.220
 points and easily make the 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.220
 headshot so here I am you this weapon 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.570
 even though I'm dead how of the same if 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.430
 she does not do damage 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.380
 considerable for some 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.920
 it nevertheless allows to do a lot 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.450
 of points and course have a little bit 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.460
 money to redeem itself in equipment 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.720
 drinking so here it is I like 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:24.700
 it's a frankly besides caste 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.959
 have the same noted that he did not even 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.480
 improved I think it's from elsewhere 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.750
 thanks to this weapon he could have waited 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.400
 summits in you remind me me 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.790
 restocking eating semolina 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.530
 myself so here's the p5 they do not 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.970
 improves only once and there this 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.370
 would be nice to see several things 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:46.989
 but hey that's not the case so much 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.800
 let's go to the pin to the man then 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.120
 you have as you have seen 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.830
 my bastille knife that improve 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.540
 becomes the defibrillator the growth 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.510
 so its aptly bears its name to animate 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.560
 the people we see then that's 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.510
 a shame because we saw in 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.370
 still made of three weapons in softer 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.690
 the laser pistol laser gun that we got 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.730
 had that from the 34th inning when 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.830
 even so you do not have to be in a hurry 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.470
 safe when he wants to play his years there 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.700
 play well in short so that we have not been 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.440
 seen that the 36th sleeve have done again 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.810
 some but the studio coach him 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.220
 stopped at run 33 so we're going 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.420
 stop there for today and then 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.070
 I'll see you soon for more 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.720
 disarm in the hope that these videos 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.860
 you and more so voili voilou the 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.930
 little wolves full of mud play a 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.830
 pilot also we all survived the end 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.830
