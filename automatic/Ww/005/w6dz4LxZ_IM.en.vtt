a<00:02:35.340> story<00:02:35.849> slide<00:02:36.859> if<00:02:37.859> it<00:02:38.099> works<00:02:38.519> for<00:02:38.819> the

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:39.359 
a story slide if it works for the

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:43.220 
a story slide if it works for the
character<00:02:41.540> which<00:02:42.540> is<00:02:42.689> why<00:02:42.840> it's<00:02:43.019> such<00:02:43.109> a

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
character which is why it's such a

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.390 
character which is why it's such a
problem<00:02:43.409> with<00:02:43.590> our<00:02:43.769> rewards<00:02:44.280> was<00:02:44.970> because<00:02:45.299> I

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
problem with our rewards was because I

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.039 
problem with our rewards was because I
didn't<00:02:47.400> get<00:02:47.549> behind<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.120> character<00:02:48.720> of<00:02:48.750> Tony

Stark<00:02:49.440> in<00:02:49.590> that<00:02:49.739> story<00:02:49.980> which<00:02:50.159> made<00:02:50.970> it<00:02:51.090> really

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
Stark in that story which made it really

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.300 
Stark in that story which made it really
hard<00:02:51.389> to<00:02:51.569> me<00:02:51.659> enjoy<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.230> story<00:02:52.739> because<00:02:53.129> I

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
hard to me enjoy the story because I

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.479 
hard to me enjoy the story because I
felt<00:02:53.579> like<00:02:54.560> the<00:02:55.560> writing<00:02:55.920> tried<00:02:56.129> to<00:02:56.250> push

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
felt like the writing tried to push

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.339 
felt like the writing tried to push
turning<00:02:57.000> this<00:02:57.150> edge<00:02:57.389> in<00:02:57.629> the<00:02:57.750> character<00:02:58.230> and

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
turning this edge in the character and

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:59.869 
turning this edge in the character and
what<00:02:58.470> isn't<00:02:58.680> in<00:02:59.010> what<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.310> character<00:02:59.609> didn't

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
what isn't in what the character didn't

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:05.420 
what isn't in what the character didn't
didn't<00:03:00.150> support<00:03:00.599> that<00:03:02.299> so<00:03:04.040> like<00:03:05.040> like<00:03:05.250> that's

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
didn't support that so like like that's

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.069 
didn't support that so like like that's
why<00:03:05.639> I<00:03:05.670> never<00:03:05.879> really<00:03:06.060> gotten<00:03:06.239> the<00:03:06.389> stuff<00:03:06.870> like

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
why I never really gotten the stuff like

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.199 
why I never really gotten the stuff like
x-men<00:03:07.439> which<00:03:07.709> are<00:03:07.859> very<00:03:07.980> story-driven<00:03:08.819> the

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
x-men which are very story-driven the

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.750 
x-men which are very story-driven the
characters<00:03:09.780> of<00:03:09.810> x<00:03:10.109> men<00:03:10.349> are<00:03:10.889> very<00:03:11.129> rarely<00:03:11.519> the

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
characters of x men are very rarely the

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.420 
characters of x men are very rarely the
focus<00:03:12.060> even<00:03:12.180> even<00:03:12.480> though<00:03:13.010> well<00:03:14.010> in<00:03:14.280> the

enjoyed<00:03:18.599> that<00:03:19.160> he<00:03:20.160> does<00:03:20.340> seem<00:03:21.269> to<00:03:21.329> be<00:03:21.389> a

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:21.449 
enjoyed that he does seem to be a

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:23.150 
enjoyed that he does seem to be a
character<00:03:21.810> item<00:03:22.169> he<00:03:22.290> also<00:03:22.410> has<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.829> huge

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
character item he also has the huge

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:29.300 
character item he also has the huge
world<00:03:23.609> spanning<00:03:24.169> stories<00:03:27.530> but<00:03:28.530> that's<00:03:28.949> why<00:03:29.280> I

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
world spanning stories but that's why I

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.129 
world spanning stories but that's why I
like<00:03:29.430> like<00:03:29.790> for<00:03:29.970> example<00:03:30.060> there's<00:03:30.750> a<00:03:30.810> series

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
like like for example there's a series

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:32.809 
like like for example there's a series
called<00:03:31.260> Sandman<00:03:31.919> which<00:03:32.159> if<00:03:32.310> you're<00:03:32.669> in<00:03:32.760> the

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.020 
called Sandman which if you're in the
comics<00:03:33.150> at<00:03:33.239> all<00:03:33.329> you<00:03:33.510> probably<00:03:34.049> heard<00:03:34.319> of<00:03:34.530> I

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
comics at all you probably heard of I

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.470 
comics at all you probably heard of I
like<00:03:36.030> this<00:03:36.299> series<00:03:36.720> but<00:03:37.199> I<00:03:37.260> don't<00:03:37.560> love<00:03:38.010> it

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
like this series but I don't love it

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.750 
like this series but I don't love it
because<00:03:39.480> I<00:03:39.930> don't<00:03:40.859> connect<00:03:41.280> with<00:03:41.459> why<00:03:41.609> the

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
because I don't connect with why the

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.030 
because I don't connect with why the
characters<00:03:42.299> like<00:03:42.569> like<00:03:42.840> I<00:03:43.139> think<00:03:43.560> Morpheus<00:03:43.949> is

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
characters like like I think Morpheus is

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.360 
characters like like I think Morpheus is
great<00:03:44.280> but<00:03:45.180> he's<00:03:45.329> not<00:03:45.479> there<00:03:45.690> half<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:45.959> time

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
great but he's not there half the time

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.619 
great but he's not there half the time
like<00:03:47.370> so<00:03:47.609> off<00:03:47.760> to<00:03:47.909> their<00:03:48.030> short<00:03:48.269> stories<00:03:48.599> and

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:48.629

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
unbelievably great for me because it's

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.460 
unbelievably great for me because it's
not<00:04:04.680> a<00:04:04.739> character-driven<00:04:05.280> story<00:04:05.489> uh<00:04:06.290> it's<00:04:07.290> one

good but watchman is very

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:10.939 
good but watchman is very
character-driven<00:04:10.260> even<00:04:10.620> though<00:04:10.680> it's<00:04:10.799> got<00:04:10.919> a

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:10.949 
character-driven even though it's got a

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:13.520 
character-driven even though it's got a
big<00:04:11.129> story<00:04:11.370> i'll<00:04:12.209> have<00:04:12.479> a<00:04:12.540> problem<00:04:13.109> with<00:04:13.229> a<00:04:13.260> big
