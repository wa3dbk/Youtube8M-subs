this<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.880> custom<00:01:45.270> soup<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.689> world<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:45.990> can

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
this is a custom soup that world you can

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.359 
this is a custom soup that world you can
tell<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.350> because<00:01:46.740> it's<00:01:47.009> such<00:01:47.220> a

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
tell that because it's such a

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.039 
tell that because it's such a
ridiculously<00:01:48.030> flat<00:01:48.329> world<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.720> unless<00:01:48.930> they

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
ridiculously flat world and unless they

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.539 
ridiculously flat world and unless they
either<00:01:49.170> place<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.799> snow<00:01:49.979> there<00:01:50.159> themselves

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
either place that snow there themselves

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.520 
either place that snow there themselves
to<00:01:50.640> be<00:01:50.729> misleading<00:01:51.060> basically<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.140> can<00:01:52.320> tell

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
to be misleading basically you can tell

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.069 
to be misleading basically you can tell
this<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.950> snow<00:01:53.430> custom<00:01:53.909> soup<00:01:54.090> lat<00:01:54.299> so<00:01:54.509> that

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
this is a snow custom soup lat so that

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.480 
this is a snow custom soup lat so that
means<00:01:55.259> at<00:01:55.380> least<00:01:55.409> one<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.829> presets<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.340> gonna

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
means at least one the presets is gonna

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.770 
means at least one the presets is gonna
be<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.640> snow<00:01:56.790> one<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.210> that's<00:01:57.360> pretty<00:01:57.570> cool

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
be the snow one and that's pretty cool

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.179 
be the snow one and that's pretty cool
so<00:01:57.960> custom<00:01:58.290> souffle<00:01:58.619> we<00:01:58.920> knew<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.100> was

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
so custom souffle we knew it was

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.380 
so custom souffle we knew it was
confirmed<00:01:59.579> but<00:01:59.759> now<00:01:59.880> we've<00:02:00.000> got<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.180> first

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
confirmed but now we've got a first

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
print shop it pretty cool and also if

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.950 
print shop it pretty cool and also if
you<00:02:02.310> look<00:02:02.340> in<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.240> frames<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.750> door

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
you look in the the frames of the door

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.999 
you look in the the frames of the door
just<00:02:04.110> there<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.439> can<00:02:04.590> see<00:02:04.740> there's<00:02:04.920> some

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
just there you can see there's some

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.530 
just there you can see there's some
purple<00:02:05.369> stuff<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:05.939> looks<00:02:06.149> like<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.420> is<00:02:06.509> a

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
purple stuff that looks like it is a

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.839 
purple stuff that looks like it is a
purple<00:02:07.049> stain<00:02:07.320> gloss<00:02:07.619> paint<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.190> as<00:02:08.429> well<00:02:08.759> as

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
purple stain gloss paint so as well as

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.040 
purple stain gloss paint so as well as
having<00:02:09.060> stained<00:02:09.270> glass<00:02:09.450> confirmed<00:02:09.840> yesterday

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
having stained glass confirmed yesterday

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.479 
having stained glass confirmed yesterday
we<00:02:10.289> do<00:02:10.470> now<00:02:10.590> have<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.890> paint<00:02:11.099> confirmed

we do now have the paint confirmed

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.070 
we do now have the paint confirmed
obviously<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.239> two<00:02:12.420> things<00:02:12.660> would<00:02:12.810> come<00:02:12.930> to

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
obviously the two things would come to

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.260 
obviously the two things would come to
get

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
get

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.760 
get
but<00:02:13.510> you<00:02:13.630> know<00:02:13.690> it<00:02:13.810> still<00:02:14.050> adds<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.680> list

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
but you know it still adds to the list

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:15.900 
but you know it still adds to the list
of<00:02:14.920> things<00:02:14.980> we<00:02:15.220> know<00:02:15.400> a<00:02:15.430> hundred<00:02:15.700> percent

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
of things we know a hundred percent

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.670 
of things we know a hundred percent
going<00:02:16.240> to<00:02:16.300> be<00:02:16.360> in<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.540> game<00:02:16.750> very<00:02:17.140> very<00:02:17.380> cool

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
going to be in the game very very cool

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.230 
going to be in the game very very cool
stuff<00:02:17.950> but<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.430> big<00:02:18.640> one<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:18.910> one<00:02:19.210> that

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
stuff but the big one the one that

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.970 
stuff but the big one the one that
starts<00:02:19.750> this<00:02:19.840> big<00:02:20.050> 1.8<00:02:20.590> you<00:02:20.710> know

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
starts this big 1.8 you know

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.920 
starts this big 1.8 you know
conversation<00:02:21.790> I<00:02:21.880> guess<00:02:22.060> is<00:02:22.240> the<00:02:22.510> fact<00:02:22.720> that<00:02:22.780> if

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
conversation I guess is the fact that if

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.810 
conversation I guess is the fact that if
you<00:02:23.020> look<00:02:23.200> around<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.950> edges<00:02:24.310> of<00:02:24.520> this<00:02:24.580> thing

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
you look around the edges of this thing

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.760 
you look around the edges of this thing
you<00:02:25.120> can<00:02:25.270> actually<00:02:25.480> see<00:02:25.720> that<00:02:26.140> there<00:02:26.290> are<00:02:26.320> six

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
you can actually see that there are six

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.380 
you can actually see that there are six
types<00:02:27.040> of<00:02:27.250> Pentacles<00:02:27.610> sorry<00:02:27.790> five<00:02:28.000> types<00:02:28.270> of

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
types of Pentacles sorry five types of

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.210 
types of Pentacles sorry five types of
fences<00:02:28.750> linking<00:02:29.410> that<00:02:29.470> thing<00:02:29.710> up<00:02:29.830> so<00:02:29.860> first

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
fences linking that thing up so first

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.920 
fences linking that thing up so first
thought<00:02:30.580> you<00:02:30.790> can<00:02:30.970> see<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.360> first<00:02:31.600> one<00:02:31.810> is

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
thought you can see the first one is

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.660 
thought you can see the first one is
just<00:02:32.290> an<00:02:32.410> oak<00:02:32.530> that's<00:02:32.800> pretty<00:02:33.040> simple<00:02:33.370> then

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
just an oak that's pretty simple then

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.070 
just an oak that's pretty simple then
you've<00:02:33.820> got<00:02:34.000> this<00:02:34.150> brush<00:02:34.420> fence<00:02:34.660> then<00:02:34.930> you've

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
you've got this brush fence then you've

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.720 
you've got this brush fence then you've
got<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.290> birch<00:02:35.500> fence<00:02:35.800> the<00:02:35.980> jungle<00:02:36.310> fence<00:02:36.490> but

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
got the birch fence the jungle fence but

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.160 
got the birch fence the jungle fence but
that<00:02:36.880> means<00:02:37.120> that<00:02:37.360> if<00:02:37.450> you<00:02:37.540> look<00:02:37.720> over<00:02:37.870> there

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
that means that if you look over there

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.650 
that means that if you look over there
that<00:02:38.590> must<00:02:38.890> be<00:02:39.010> a<00:02:39.340> dark<00:02:39.730> oak<00:02:39.970> fence<00:02:40.330> so<00:02:40.630> that

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
that must be a dark oak fence so that

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.510 
that must be a dark oak fence so that
means<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.290> dark<00:02:41.500> oak<00:02:41.680> trees<00:02:41.920> confirmed<00:02:42.370> I

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
means the dark oak trees confirmed I

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.770 
means the dark oak trees confirmed I
actually<00:02:42.760> honestly<00:02:43.030> can't<00:02:43.360> tell<00:02:43.450> if<00:02:43.660> this<00:02:43.720> is

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
actually honestly can't tell if this is

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.320 
actually honestly can't tell if this is
junk<00:02:44.110> or<00:02:44.230> acacia<00:02:45.010> tree<00:02:45.400> if<00:02:45.550> you<00:02:45.610> just<00:02:45.850> look<00:02:46.180> the

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
junk or acacia tree if you just look the

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.700 
junk or acacia tree if you just look the
one<00:02:46.660> that's<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:46.900> bottom<00:02:47.110> right<00:02:47.260> but<00:02:47.590> either

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
one that's the bottom right but either

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.470 
one that's the bottom right but either
way<00:02:47.950> there<00:02:48.160> is<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.460> new<00:02:48.610> fences<00:02:49.030> coming<00:02:49.330> and

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
way there is the new fences coming and

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.840 
way there is the new fences coming and
these<00:02:49.720> were<00:02:49.960> not<00:02:50.230> a<00:02:50.380> 1.7<00:02:50.680> feature<00:02:51.280> contrary<00:02:51.760> to

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
these were not a 1.7 feature contrary to

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.820 
these were not a 1.7 feature contrary to
plot<00:02:52.000> brutally<00:02:52.330> the<00:02:52.720> new<00:02:53.110> fences<00:02:53.500> actually

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
plot brutally the new fences actually

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.500 
plot brutally the new fences actually
came<00:02:54.010> in<00:02:54.040> with<00:02:54.340> 1.8<00:02:54.850> they<00:02:55.030> came<00:02:55.210> in<00:02:55.300> a<00:02:55.360> lot

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
came in with 1.8 they came in a lot

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.180 
came in with 1.8 they came in a lot
early<00:02:55.750> of<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.900> pocket<00:02:56.170> edition<00:02:56.260> but<00:02:56.860> they<00:02:56.980> are

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
early of the pocket edition but they are

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.520 
early of the pocket edition but they are
a<00:02:57.220> 1.8<00:02:57.850> feature<00:02:58.060> from<00:02:58.300> the<00:02:58.420> pc<00:02:58.750> and<00:02:58.870> also

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
a 1.8 feature from the pc and also

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.990 
a 1.8 feature from the pc and also
alongside<00:02:59.860> that<00:03:00.220> if<00:03:00.340> you<00:03:00.430> look<00:03:00.580> at<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:00.760> door

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
alongside that if you look at the door

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.520 
alongside that if you look at the door
there<00:03:01.210> it's<00:03:01.420> so<00:03:01.750> hard<00:03:01.960> to<00:03:02.020> tell<00:03:02.230> from<00:03:02.350> this

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
there it's so hard to tell from this

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.990 
there it's so hard to tell from this
small<00:03:02.770> screen<00:03:03.040> shot<00:03:03.190> but<00:03:03.490> that<00:03:03.580> does<00:03:03.790> look

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
small screen shot but that does look

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.790 
small screen shot but that does look
like<00:03:04.060> that<00:03:04.390> is<00:03:04.510> also<00:03:04.900> going<00:03:05.080> to<00:03:05.200> be<00:03:05.380> a<00:03:05.410> brand

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
like that is also going to be a brand

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.960 
like that is also going to be a brand
new<00:03:05.920> type<00:03:06.100> of<00:03:06.130> door<00:03:06.400> it<00:03:06.550> doesn't<00:03:06.580> look<00:03:06.910> like

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
new type of door it doesn't look like

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.670 
new type of door it doesn't look like
it's<00:03:07.270> a<00:03:07.330> wooden<00:03:07.570> door<00:03:07.690> it<00:03:07.840> might<00:03:08.170> be<00:03:08.350> ironed

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
it's a wooden door it might be ironed

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.990 
it's a wooden door it might be ironed
but<00:03:08.890> it<00:03:09.010> it<00:03:09.220> looks<00:03:09.460> more<00:03:09.550> likely<00:03:09.790> to<00:03:09.880> be<00:03:09.970> a

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
but it it looks more likely to be a

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.100 
but it it looks more likely to be a
birch<00:03:10.270> door<00:03:10.570> or<00:03:10.690> something<00:03:10.930> like<00:03:11.050> that

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
birch door or something like that

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.200 
birch door or something like that
meaning<00:03:11.650> this<00:03:11.950> also<00:03:12.250> confirms<00:03:12.790> to<00:03:12.910> us<00:03:13.000> a<00:03:13.030> new

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
meaning this also confirms to us a new

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.300 
meaning this also confirms to us a new
doors<00:03:13.450> are<00:03:13.570> coming<00:03:13.810> another<00:03:14.200> 1.8<00:03:14.800> features<00:03:15.160> so

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
doors are coming another 1.8 features so

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.800 
doors are coming another 1.8 features so
the<00:03:15.670> fact<00:03:15.880> that<00:03:15.970> this<00:03:16.090> is<00:03:16.270> the<00:03:16.480> first

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
the fact that this is the first

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.000 
the fact that this is the first

pc updates and dog matched case you

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.150 
pc updates and dog matched case you
don't<00:03:25.420> know<00:03:25.450> it's<00:03:25.990> very<00:03:26.260> very<00:03:26.560> exciting<00:03:26.650> stuff

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
don't know it's very very exciting stuff

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.980 
don't know it's very very exciting stuff
because<00:03:27.459> this<00:03:27.610> does<00:03:27.850> mean<00:03:28.060> if<00:03:28.300> it<00:03:28.630> was<00:03:28.660> gonna

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:28.990 
because this does mean if it was gonna

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.330 
because this does mean if it was gonna
be<00:03:29.170> just<00:03:29.410> you<00:03:29.500> know<00:03:29.650> at<00:03:29.830> one<00:03:29.980> point<00:03:30.010> seven

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
be just you know at one point seven

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.100 
be just you know at one point seven
update<00:03:30.640> with<00:03:30.730> a<00:03:30.760> couple<00:03:31.150> of<00:03:31.180> 1.8<00:03:31.600> things<00:03:31.810> you

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
update with a couple of 1.8 things you

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.449 
update with a couple of 1.8 things you
won't<00:03:32.230> blow<00:03:32.470> you<00:03:32.860> you<00:03:33.010> know<00:03:33.100> you<00:03:33.130> wouldn't

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
won't blow you you know you wouldn't

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.040 
won't blow you you know you wouldn't
talk<00:03:33.640> about<00:03:33.670> those<00:03:34.060> things<00:03:34.090> first<00:03:34.660> you<00:03:34.930> would

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
talk about those things first you would

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.530 
talk about those things first you would
mention<00:03:35.410> the<00:03:36.040> you<00:03:36.310> know<00:03:36.400> the<00:03:36.520> 1.7<00:03:37.120> stuff<00:03:37.330> and

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
mention the you know the 1.7 stuff and

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.090 
mention the you know the 1.7 stuff and
then<00:03:37.780> maybe<00:03:38.080> throwing<00:03:38.440> the<00:03:38.590> of<00:03:38.680> stuff<00:03:38.890> later

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
then maybe throwing the of stuff later

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.040 
then maybe throwing the of stuff later
but<00:03:39.580> it<00:03:39.700> does<00:03:39.880> seem<00:03:40.150> like<00:03:40.209> this<00:03:40.510> will<00:03:40.690> be<00:03:40.840> both

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
but it does seem like this will be both

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.290 
but it does seem like this will be both
1.7<00:03:41.770> and<00:03:41.950> one<00:03:42.130> point<00:03:42.340> am<00:03:42.490> one<00:03:42.610> update<00:03:42.940> we<00:03:43.060> can't

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
1.7 and one point am one update we can't

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.820 
1.7 and one point am one update we can't
confirm<00:03:43.450> that<00:03:43.600> just<00:03:43.930> yet<00:03:44.080> but<00:03:44.380> we<00:03:44.500> do<00:03:44.680> know
