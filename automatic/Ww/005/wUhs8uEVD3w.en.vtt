00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:09.280

 I'd had seen black in Mimashi was real-time budget from 3 o'clock in the morning today until about 4 o'clock half 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.320

 Kedomo it was there that gdc p at greater than or equal to the 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.710
 That 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:28.720
 Here where that twin facts 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:33.720
 It has been announced that Mezu Gear Solid 5 has been announced 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:40.500
 That's right I finally came out 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:45.190
 There were various things such as Ground Zeros and Phantom Payne, but the navigation section 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:48.280
 I don't think this will happen like this 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:52.890
 I see again- 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.890
 Also It is amazing the feeling that had been done 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:59.440
 I 'm still betrayed in a good sense, really 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.860
 truly 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:09.640
 In the ground zero portion of Engineering 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:16.930
 Human phantom pane like a yes kinda do not know what to say of Kitena is 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:20.590
 As it seems that the official site of a little bit new also came out newly , such as the link of the official site below 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.490
 I put it in various ways, so I think I want you to watch it by all means 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.730
 Hey 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:30.590
 Hey that 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:33.480
 I started watching from 3 am to 4:30 am in front of a PC . 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:40.050
 Went finished in the first half due in 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:40.800
 But it went or flew distribution of the futon from me Toma sleepy at Well's name more than one Well 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.560
 Also 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:48.270
 When you open your cell phone, that kind of thing is already great 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:53.759
 It 's already like ttl 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:55.820
 Mom-5-half past 5 o'clock thanks 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:01.120
 I and probably not the right hand 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.120
 5:00 I'll also look at Bakka reaction of twitter to around half 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.080
 Lack of sleep 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:12.369
 Yes 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:12.369
 Ne is a woman shortage to not come out Date 6 still 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.510
 Hard now N Toko, which is that released 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:25.200
 Samurokumaru 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:30.330
 I have two out with ps 3, but I can not get an exception 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:38.190
 I feel like I can not do anything with ps 4 and its pc 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:42.239
 It was a description of the Well fox engine in Nunn gdc 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:45.220
 It was a heterogeneous or say I'm this happens is this way even with the 1000 people hook 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.940
 But that's kinda crazy 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.680
 eh 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:58.100
 Is that star dt of cg relation ? 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:03:05.810
 It is there for I say that writing relationship or the like is that physics specific array 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:10.070
 There'll It was amazing is turned also to engine that another Konami of Once fully longer complete 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:12.220
 What is the game going? Kimon Silent Hill or Konami's game 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:17.710
 Because 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:19.220
 The silent metaphor and the ruthless realism, or still quite realistically 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:23.990
 but 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:25.910
 What is the game of Konami after Silent Hill or Metal Gear Solit ? 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.150
 I wonder if there was something in the game 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.689
 I'd do not know well come 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:36.640
 It will be a little scary to finish sunny 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:40.360
 Games are no longer likely to momentum in the other game 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:45.280
 Such Toka that new users to play 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:48.170
 That seems to be enjoyable even if you do not play illusion 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.990
 Also works are likely to be completed 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.650
 Like a movie with just a movie 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:56.930
 Game sound of 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:59.310
 I wonder how many times I have already said 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:04.170
 By all means 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:08.069
 Let everyone from ne No that the link 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:14.380
 Let's all together Let's even those who do not know metal gear 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:18.100
 The last part is the point that becomes part of the 6th star that will be the one that has been part of 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:22.540
 Finally, why I ever or sites of is I say anxious 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:25.639
 I've been doing each up to 4 I I've been doing a number all the way until now 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:29.240
 Why it was meaningless Later in the 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:30.670
 Dog a little anxious it will be with me 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.390
 that's all 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:36.380
 About bulletin metal gear solid 5 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.980
 It was a bad news 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.980
 Please
