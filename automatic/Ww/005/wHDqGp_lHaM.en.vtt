who<00:01:04.559> knows<00:01:04.799> maybe<00:01:05.010> when<00:01:05.430> he<00:01:05.489> goes<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.790> this

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
who knows maybe when he goes to this

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.490 
who knows maybe when he goes to this
form<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.330> slows<00:01:06.510> down<00:01:06.689> it's<00:01:06.869> hard<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.320> could<00:01:07.439> be

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
form it slows down it's hard it could be

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.810 
form it slows down it's hard it could be
so<00:01:07.650> many<00:01:07.740> different<00:01:08.070> things<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.520> same

it of itself so definitely I mess with
it<00:01:20.220> but<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.700> can<00:01:21.060> see<00:01:21.330> why<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.930> certain

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
it but I can see why to a certain

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.990 
it but I can see why to a certain
agreeing<00:01:22.560> people<00:01:22.920> might<00:01:23.070> not<00:01:23.220> like<00:01:23.460> it

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
agreeing people might not like it

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.640 
agreeing people might not like it
because<00:01:24.270> they<00:01:24.420> were<00:01:24.479> expecting<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.110> muscular

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
because they were expecting a muscular

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.080 
because they were expecting a muscular
just<00:01:25.860> like<00:01:25.979> straight-up<00:01:26.280> Luffy<00:01:26.700> maybe<00:01:26.880> a

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
just like straight-up Luffy maybe a

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.880 
just like straight-up Luffy maybe a
smaller<00:01:27.600> form<00:01:27.900> which<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.170> still<00:01:28.409> could<00:01:28.530> happen

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
smaller form which it still could happen

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.219 
smaller form which it still could happen
maybe<00:01:29.040> there's<00:01:29.310> still<00:01:29.400> like<00:01:30.229> transformation

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
maybe there's still like transformation

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.990 
maybe there's still like transformation
in<00:01:31.500> gear<00:01:31.740> forth<00:01:32.040> like<00:01:32.220> maybe<00:01:32.400> he<00:01:32.610> got<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.880> get<00:01:32.970> a

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
in gear forth like maybe he got to get a

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.429 
in gear forth like maybe he got to get a
little<00:01:33.150> bit<00:01:33.360> more<00:01:33.509> serious<00:01:33.900> during<00:01:34.259> this

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
little bit more serious during this

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.929 
little bit more serious during this
fight<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.890> he'll<00:01:35.159> slim<00:01:35.430> down<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.610> little<00:01:35.820> bit

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
fight and he'll slim down a little bit

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.520 
fight and he'll slim down a little bit
and<00:01:36.090> become<00:01:36.299> more<00:01:36.479> fast<00:01:36.689> or<00:01:36.900> something<00:01:37.020> like

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
and become more fast or something like

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.859 
and become more fast or something like
that<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:38.189> that's<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.460> possibility<00:01:39.060> but<00:01:39.270> as<00:01:39.479> of

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
that so that's the possibility but as of

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.630 
that so that's the possibility but as of
right<00:01:39.900> now<00:01:40.140> me<00:01:40.650> personally<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.159> think<00:01:41.310> it's

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
right now me personally I think it's

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.550 
right now me personally I think it's
epic<00:01:41.880> as<00:01:42.000> shit<00:01:42.210> it's<00:01:42.390> older<00:01:42.930> yet<00:01:43.110> again<00:01:43.350> being

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
epic as shit it's older yet again being

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.010 
epic as shit it's older yet again being
original<00:01:44.040> not<00:01:44.220> going<00:01:44.460> into<00:01:44.640> DBZ<00:01:45.450> territory

because<00:02:41.280> as<00:02:41.460> right<00:02:41.910> now<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.090> can<00:02:42.300> tell<00:02:42.510> during

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
because as right now you can tell during

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.300 
because as right now you can tell during
the<00:02:42.900> fight<00:02:43.170> he's<00:02:43.560> smart<00:02:43.860> at<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.040> end<00:02:44.130> the<00:02:44.190> day

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
the fight he's smart at the end the day

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.650 
the fight he's smart at the end the day
and<00:02:44.490> he's<00:02:44.610> gonna<00:02:44.820> come<00:02:45.030> up<00:02:45.120> with<00:02:45.270> some<00:02:45.420> sort<00:02:45.630> of

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
and he's gonna come up with some sort of

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.240 
and he's gonna come up with some sort of
strategy<00:02:45.750> he's<00:02:46.140> like<00:02:46.260> okay<00:02:46.470> so<00:02:46.830> even<00:02:47.100> though

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
strategy he's like okay so even though

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.160 
strategy he's like okay so even though
he's<00:02:47.459> still<00:02:47.610> you<00:02:48.150> know<00:02:48.240> he<00:02:48.390> has<00:02:48.510> his<00:02:48.660> muscular

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
he's still you know he has his muscular

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.170 
he's still you know he has his muscular
form<00:02:49.410> with<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.650> hockey<00:02:50.040> he's<00:02:50.459> still<00:02:50.670> bouncy

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
form with the hockey he's still bouncy

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.240 
form with the hockey he's still bouncy
so<00:02:51.330> maybe<00:02:51.540> he'll<00:02:51.720> try<00:02:51.930> to<00:02:51.959> poke<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:52.560> hole<00:02:52.709> in<00:02:52.920> him

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
so maybe he'll try to poke a hole in him

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.040 
so maybe he'll try to poke a hole in him
or<00:02:53.400> pop<00:02:53.610> them<00:02:53.640> or<00:02:53.970> something<00:02:54.120> lines<00:02:54.630> up<00:02:54.750> net<00:02:54.900> so

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
or pop them or something lines up net so

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.300 
or pop them or something lines up net so
you<00:02:55.350> definitely<00:02:55.440> see<00:02:55.770> that<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:55.980> fight<00:02:56.160> isn't

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
this and his abilities at the same time

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.750 
this and his abilities at the same time
can<00:03:46.260> help<00:03:46.350> him<00:03:46.500> fight<00:03:46.680> different<00:03:47.040> bows<00:03:47.220> so<00:03:47.549> I

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
can help him fight different bows so I

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.420 
can help him fight different bows so I
don't<00:03:48.360> see<00:03:48.600> why<00:03:48.870> anyone<00:03:48.900> like<00:03:49.440> again<00:03:50.160> I<00:03:50.190> can

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
don't see why anyone like again I can

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.979
