00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
the the extent of the gameplay mechanics

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.960 
the the extent of the gameplay mechanics
which<00:01:34.470> makes<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:35.159> puzzles<00:01:35.549> pretty<00:01:35.790> good

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
which makes the puzzles pretty good

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.010 
which makes the puzzles pretty good
pretty<00:01:36.240> simple<00:01:36.360> but<00:01:36.750> also<00:01:38.869> somewhat<00:01:39.869> unusual

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
pretty simple but also somewhat unusual

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.499 
pretty simple but also somewhat unusual
in<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.710> way<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:40.860> solve<00:01:41.159> them<00:01:41.369> which<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.329> good

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
in the way you solve them which is good

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.750 
in the way you solve them which is good
a<00:01:42.540> lot<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.960> problems<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.500> have<00:01:43.590> with

scene reminds me of the the first screen
of<00:03:03.420> Dragon's<00:03:03.930> Lair<00:03:04.880> so<00:03:05.880> it's<00:03:06.090> important<00:03:06.450> to

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
of Dragon's Lair so it's important to

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.970 
of Dragon's Lair so it's important to
pay<00:03:06.660> close<00:03:06.900> attention<00:03:07.410> during<00:03:07.560> this<00:03:07.739> scene

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
bridge but then we will start solving

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.729 
bridge but then we will start solving
the<00:03:29.489> puzzle<00:03:31.100> first<00:03:32.100> we'll<00:03:32.670> talk<00:03:33.030> to<00:03:33.209> this<00:03:33.360> guy

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
the puzzle first we'll talk to this guy

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
all for now let's climb up this ladder

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.360 
all for now let's climb up this ladder
and<00:04:28.580> try<00:04:28.700> to<00:04:28.760> get<00:04:28.970> that<00:04:29.590> street<00:04:30.590> light<00:04:30.620> though

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
and try to get that street light though

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.460 
and try to get that street light though
meanwhile<00:04:32.060> I'm<00:04:32.300> just<00:04:32.479> thinking<00:04:32.750> like<00:04:32.870> what<00:04:33.290> is

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
meanwhile I'm just thinking like what is

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.279 
meanwhile I'm just thinking like what is
the<00:04:33.650> guy<00:04:33.889> in<00:04:34.280> that<00:04:34.580> bridge<00:04:35.450> control<00:04:36.020> room

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:36.289 
the guy in that bridge control room

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:38.140 
the guy in that bridge control room
thinking<00:04:36.740> like<00:04:36.919> obviously<00:04:37.400> he<00:04:37.580> can<00:04:37.760> see<00:04:37.970> this

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
thinking like obviously he can see this

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.750 
thinking like obviously he can see this
whole<00:04:38.360> thing<00:04:38.600> going<00:04:38.780> down<00:04:39.130> just<00:04:40.130> imagine<00:04:40.370> him

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
whole thing going down just imagine him

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.790 
whole thing going down just imagine him
being<00:04:40.789> like<00:04:41.090> nice<00:04:41.450> try<00:04:41.810> but<00:04:42.080> like<00:04:42.380> what<00:04:42.650> the

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
being like nice try but like what the

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.050 
being like nice try but like what the
 did<00:04:43.220> you<00:04:43.340> think<00:04:43.580> I<00:04:43.699> could<00:04:43.850> see

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
you through you don't look anything like

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.930 
you through you don't look anything like
us<00:04:49.270> one<00:04:50.270> more<00:04:50.479> rung<00:04:51.310> hmm<00:04:52.310> stretch<00:04:52.669> out<00:04:52.880> a

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
us one more rung hmm stretch out a

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.219 
us one more rung hmm stretch out a
little<00:04:53.030> bit<00:04:53.360> grab<00:04:53.780> the<00:04:53.960> light<00:04:54.820> fall<00:04:55.820> off<00:04:56.229> and

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
little bit grab the light fall off and

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:59.409 
little bit grab the light fall off and
then<00:04:57.289> we'll<00:04:57.620> combine<00:04:57.940> the<00:04:58.940> light<00:04:59.180> with<00:04:59.389> a

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
then we'll combine the light with a

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:01.839 
then we'll combine the light with a
pylon<00:04:59.990> kind<00:05:00.830> of<00:05:00.919> like<00:05:01.039> screw<00:05:01.430> it<00:05:01.460> onto<00:05:01.700> our

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:01.849 
pylon kind of like screw it onto our

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:05.379 
pylon kind of like screw it onto our
heads<00:05:02.210> here<00:05:03.789> and<00:05:04.789> of<00:05:05.090> course<00:05:05.120> it

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:05.389 
heads here and of course it

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:08.379 
heads here and of course it
automatically<00:05:05.900> lights<00:05:06.229> up<00:05:06.910> so<00:05:07.910> let's<00:05:08.090> uh

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
automatically lights up so let's uh

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:10.300 
automatically lights up so let's uh
let's<00:05:08.900> ring<00:05:09.200> this<00:05:09.289> Bell<00:05:09.530> again<00:05:09.770> see<00:05:10.010> if<00:05:10.099> we<00:05:10.190> got

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
let's ring this Bell again see if we got

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.439 
let's ring this Bell again see if we got
enough
