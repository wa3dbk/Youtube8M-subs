kind of be like IV Sora's vine whip but
the<00:01:26.369> twist<00:01:26.610> would<00:01:26.790> be<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.630> in<00:01:27.810> Golden<00:01:28.200> Sun<00:01:28.409> you

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
the twist would be so in Golden Sun you

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.460 
the twist would be so in Golden Sun you
have<00:01:28.740> multiple<00:01:29.189> tiers<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.700> magic<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.470> the

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.440 
have multiple tiers of magic and the
twist<00:01:31.770> for<00:01:32.040> Isaac<00:01:32.700> would<00:01:32.850> be<00:01:33.000> as<00:01:33.240> his

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
twist for Isaac would be as his

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.609 
twist for Isaac would be as his
percentage<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.680> damage<00:01:35.130> Rises<00:01:35.640> his<00:01:36.619> synergy

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
percentage of damage Rises his synergy

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.280 
percentage of damage Rises his synergy
attacks<00:01:38.009> get<00:01:38.640> more<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.450> more<00:01:39.479> dramatic<00:01:39.990> so

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
attacks get more and more dramatic so

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.350 
attacks get more and more dramatic so
it'll<00:01:40.860> go<00:01:40.979> from<00:01:41.189> growth<00:01:41.520> which<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:41.909> just<00:01:42.119> one

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
it'll go from growth which is just one

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.510 
it'll go from growth which is just one
vine<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.619> strikes<00:01:43.950> up<00:01:44.070> into<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.340> air

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
vine that that strikes up into the air

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.149 
vine that that strikes up into the air
to<00:01:44.549> mad<00:01:45.000> growth<00:01:45.270> which<00:01:45.479> is<00:01:45.600> multiple<00:01:45.960> vines<00:01:46.200> to

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
to mad growth which is multiple vines to

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.219 
to mad growth which is multiple vines to
wild<00:01:47.579> growth<00:01:47.850> which<00:01:48.180> like<00:01:48.509> would<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:49.079> guess

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
wild growth which like would I guess

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.139 
wild growth which like would I guess
lash<00:01:49.530> out<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:50.100> bunch<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.610> characters<00:01:50.820> around

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
lash out it a bunch of characters around

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.670 
lash out it a bunch of characters around
him<00:01:51.360> in<00:01:51.540> addition<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.899> ones<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.259> are<00:01:52.439> above

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
him in addition to ones that are above

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.380 
him in addition to ones that are above
him<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:53.040> think<00:01:53.729> that'd<00:01:53.909> be<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:54.030> kind<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.270> an

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
him I think that'd be a kind of an

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.690 
him I think that'd be a kind of an
interesting<00:01:54.479> way<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.020> use<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.950> whole<00:01:56.280> tiered

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
interesting way to use that whole tiered

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.480 
interesting way to use that whole tiered
magic<00:01:57.090> system<00:01:57.530> kind<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.590> like<00:01:58.770> how<00:01:58.920> Robin<00:01:59.159> has

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
magic system kind of like how Robin has

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.319 
magic system kind of like how Robin has
his<00:01:59.700> multiple<00:02:00.180> thunders<00:02:01.820> for<00:02:02.820> down<00:02:03.000> B<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.240> think

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
his multiple thunders for down B I think

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.359 
his multiple thunders for down B I think
it'd<00:02:03.540> be<00:02:03.570> spire<00:02:04.020> where<00:02:04.469> he<00:02:04.740> summons<00:02:05.159> a

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
it'd be spire where he summons a

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.850 
it'd be spire where he summons a
stalactite<00:02:06.270> from<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.020> ceiling<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.560> falls

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
stalactite from the ceiling that falls

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.619 
stalactite from the ceiling that falls
on<00:02:08.009> people<00:02:08.160> again<00:02:08.729> strength<00:02:09.149> will<00:02:09.300> depend<00:02:09.569> on

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
on people again strength will depend on

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.010 
on people again strength will depend on
percentage<00:02:10.020> so

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
percentage so

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.020 
percentage so
as<00:02:11.260> he<00:02:11.410> takes<00:02:11.650> more<00:02:11.890> damage<00:02:12.160> he<00:02:12.310> summons<00:02:12.820> more

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
as he takes more damage he summons more

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.660 
as he takes more damage he summons more
stalactites<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:13.810> for<00:02:14.770> the<00:02:14.830> final<00:02:15.100> smash<00:02:15.310> of

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
stalactites and for the final smash of

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.900 
stalactites and for the final smash of
course<00:02:15.970> it<00:02:16.360> would<00:02:16.600> be<00:02:16.630> summon<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:17.910> summon

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
course it would be summon and summon

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.230 
course it would be summon and summon
like<00:02:19.240> the<00:02:19.480> other<00:02:20.370> special<00:02:21.370> magic<00:02:21.970> attacks

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
like the other special magic attacks

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.630 
like the other special magic attacks
would<00:02:22.480> also<00:02:22.840> scale<00:02:23.440> based<00:02:23.710> on<00:02:23.800> percentage<00:02:24.310> so

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
would also scale based on percentage so

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.580 
would also scale based on percentage so
they'd<00:02:24.850> get<00:02:25.060> more<00:02:25.270> and<00:02:25.420> more<00:02:25.480> dramatic<00:02:25.750> as<00:02:26.290> he

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
they'd get more and more dramatic as he

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.560 
they'd get more and more dramatic as he
takes<00:02:26.830> more<00:02:27.010> and<00:02:27.070> more<00:02:27.160> damage<00:02:27.520> so<00:02:28.180> beats<00:02:28.390> I'm

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
takes more and more damage so beats I'm

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.320 
takes more and more damage so beats I'm
envious<00:02:28.870> maybe<00:02:29.500> for<00:02:29.770> starters<00:02:30.070> summon<00:02:30.790> Ramses

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
envious maybe for starters summon Ramses

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.810 
envious maybe for starters summon Ramses
the<00:02:31.570> giant<00:02:31.960> stinks<00:02:32.530> looking<00:02:32.800> thing<00:02:33.040> and<00:02:33.700> then

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
had a funnel smash that was only

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.010 
had a funnel smash that was only
accessible<00:02:39.430> if<00:02:39.700> you<00:02:39.790> had<00:02:39.940> like<00:02:40.120> 300<00:02:40.840> damage

but also how cool it would be when you
do<00:02:45.790> right<00:02:46.420> it<00:02:46.600> becomes<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:47.020> sort<00:02:47.380> of<00:02:47.440> thing

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
do right it becomes the sort of thing
