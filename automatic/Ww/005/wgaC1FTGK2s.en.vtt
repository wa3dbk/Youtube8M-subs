00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
much like any other MMO you have to

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.990 
much like any other MMO you have to
align<00:00:34.739> yourself<00:00:34.860> with<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.219> fraction<00:00:35.790> which

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
align yourself with a fraction which

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.030 
align yourself with a fraction which
will<00:00:36.210> completely<00:00:36.750> absolutely<00:00:37.680> affect<00:00:37.920> your

gameplay<00:00:38.160> experience<00:00:38.760> similar<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.270> World<00:00:39.450> of

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
gameplay experience similar to World of

gameplay experience similar to World of
Warcraft's<00:00:39.960> horde<00:00:40.320> versus<00:00:40.680> Alliance

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160

customization<00:00:42.030> isn't<00:00:42.360> particularly<00:00:42.690> strong

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
customization isn't particularly strong

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.750 
customization isn't particularly strong
in<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:43.770> game<00:00:43.980> but<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.280> does<00:00:44.460> get<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.730> job

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
in this game but it does get the job

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.940 
in this game but it does get the job
done<00:00:45.090> certainly<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:46.289> when<00:00:46.440> we<00:00:46.530> type<00:00:46.680> into<00:00:46.829> the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
done certainly so when we type into the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.560 
done certainly so when we type into the
game<00:00:47.100> space<00:00:47.399> for<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.640> first<00:00:47.850> time<00:00:48.059> you're

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
game space for the first time you're

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.540 
game space for the first time you're
gonna<00:00:48.719> see<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.050> average<00:00:49.200> MMO<00:00:49.710> UI<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.309> luckily

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
gonna see the average MMO UI and luckily

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.069 
gonna see the average MMO UI and luckily
it<00:00:50.700> isn't<00:00:50.940> too<00:00:51.000> complicated<00:00:51.329> but<00:00:51.629> still<00:00:51.690> I

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
it isn't too complicated but still I

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.080 
it isn't too complicated but still I
enjoy<00:00:52.710> innovative<00:00:53.190> designs<00:00:53.489> such<00:00:53.760> as<00:00:53.789> scene

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
enjoy innovative designs such as scene

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.270 
enjoy innovative designs such as scene
as<00:00:54.329> in<00:00:54.629> like<00:00:54.870> Guild<00:00:55.079> Wars<00:00:55.230> 2<00:00:55.320> or<00:00:55.770> Elder<00:00:56.010> Scrolls

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
as in like Guild Wars 2 or Elder Scrolls

online<00:00:56.399> one<00:00:57.329> thing<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:57.930> would<00:00:58.079> like<00:00:58.320> to

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410

mention<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.010> fact<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.670> help<00:00:59.879> icons

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
mention is the fact that the help icons

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.389 
mention is the fact that the help icons
actually<00:01:00.870> display<00:01:01.230> videos<00:01:01.620> instead<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.129> just

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
actually display videos instead of just

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.820
