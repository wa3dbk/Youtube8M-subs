nor do I intend on testing it so
normally<00:02:10.259> this<00:02:10.410> would<00:02:10.619> activate<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.039> console

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
normally this would activate the console

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.770 
normally this would activate the console
it<00:02:11.670> doesn't<00:02:12.000> work

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
for me I don't know if they patch it but

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.760 
for me I don't know if they patch it but
some<00:02:15.300> people<00:02:15.330> report<00:02:15.930> success<00:02:16.110> some<00:02:16.500> people

some people report success some people

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.220 
some people report success some people
don't<00:02:17.090> anyway<00:02:18.090> I<00:02:18.390> would<00:02:18.660> just<00:02:18.810> set<00:02:18.959> this<00:02:19.080> to

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
don't anyway I would just set this to

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.920 
don't anyway I would just set this to
one<00:02:19.410> just<00:02:19.620> in<00:02:19.830> case<00:02:20.040> I'll<00:02:20.720> put<00:02:21.720> in<00:02:21.840> the

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
one just in case I'll put in the

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.420 
one just in case I'll put in the
description<00:02:22.020> again<00:02:22.440> just<00:02:22.770> just<00:02:23.130> in<00:02:23.220> case<00:02:23.340> you

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
description again just just in case you

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.390 
description again just just in case you
can't<00:02:23.580> see<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:23.790> so<00:02:24.170> um

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
can't see it so um

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.150 
can't see it so um
once<00:02:26.400> you<00:02:26.520> have<00:02:26.700> those<00:02:26.850> two<00:02:27.440> set<00:02:28.440> up<00:02:28.590> save<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:29.040> I

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
once you have those two set up save it I

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.800 
once you have those two set up save it I
can<00:02:29.430> I<00:02:29.459> didn't<00:02:29.790> modify<00:02:30.120> anything<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:32.780> yeah<00:02:33.780> I

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
can I didn't modify anything and yeah I

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.100 
can I didn't modify anything and yeah I
mean<00:02:34.050> it<00:02:34.230> should<00:02:34.440> look<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:35.750> little<00:02:36.750> bit<00:02:36.930> like

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
mean it should look a little bit like

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.650 
mean it should look a little bit like
this<00:02:37.350> let's<00:02:37.590> see<00:02:37.709> if<00:02:37.830> I<00:02:37.950> can't<00:02:38.220> pull<00:02:38.459> up<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:39.480> bit

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
this let's see if I can't pull up a bit

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:50.210 
this let's see if I can't pull up a bit
of<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.840> video<00:02:45.200> all<00:02:46.200> right<00:02:46.769> so<00:02:47.450> as<00:02:49.010> you<00:02:50.010> can<00:02:50.160> see

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
of the video all right so as you can see

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.110 
of the video all right so as you can see
the<00:02:51.440> ammos<00:02:52.440> counts<00:02:53.280> going<00:02:53.519> down<00:02:53.670> this<00:02:53.880> because

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
the ammos counts going down this because

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.850 
the ammos counts going down this because
you<00:02:54.209> have<00:02:54.330> an<00:02:54.420> activity<00:02:54.660> bind<00:02:55.140> yet<00:02:55.320> so

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
you have an activity bind yet so

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.080 
you have an activity bind yet so
activate<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.730> bind<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.440> oh<00:02:58.440> look<00:02:59.310> it's<00:02:59.940> not

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
activate the bind and oh look it's not

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.449 
activate the bind and oh look it's not
going<00:03:00.330> down<00:03:00.530> this<00:03:01.530> should<00:03:01.739> work<00:03:01.920> with<00:03:02.130> just

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
going down this should work with just

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:03.680 
going down this should work with just
about<00:03:02.519> every<00:03:02.850> weapon<00:03:03.030> it<00:03:03.300> works<00:03:03.450> with<00:03:03.569> the

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
about every weapon it works with the

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.100 
about every weapon it works with the
Olympia<00:03:04.340> 2014<00:03:05.340> I<00:03:05.580> haven't<00:03:05.940> really<00:03:06.300> had<00:03:07.050> the

Olympia 2014 I haven't really had the

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.670 
Olympia 2014 I haven't really had the

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
time to play a whole round by myself but

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.759 
time to play a whole round by myself but
um<00:03:11.269> so<00:03:12.269> yeah<00:03:12.690> that's<00:03:12.900> that's<00:03:13.230> how<00:03:13.410> you<00:03:13.470> set<00:03:13.739> it

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
um so yeah that's that's how you set it

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.080 
um so yeah that's that's how you set it
up<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:14.250> it<00:03:14.730> works<00:03:14.940> flawlessly<00:03:15.239> so<00:03:16.880> I'll<00:03:17.880> see

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
up and it works flawlessly so I'll see

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.759 
up and it works flawlessly so I'll see
