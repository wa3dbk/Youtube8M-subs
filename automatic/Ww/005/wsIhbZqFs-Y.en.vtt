disks that you throw on the ground of

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.890 
disks that you throw on the ground of
course<00:02:18.939> and<00:02:19.150> when<00:02:19.239> you<00:02:19.329> walk<00:02:19.540> into<00:02:19.719> the

Oh recoilless they did have kind of like
a<00:02:50.680> weird<00:02:51.010> sway<00:02:51.579> recoil<00:02:52.180> in<00:02:52.419> modern<00:02:52.870> warfare<00:02:53.019> 3

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:53.169 
a weird sway recoil in modern warfare 3

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:56.580 
a weird sway recoil in modern warfare 3
so<00:02:54.010> it's<00:02:54.430> not<00:02:54.819> as<00:02:55.090> I<00:02:55.540> don't<00:02:56.049> know<00:02:56.109> it<00:02:56.260> doesn't

so it's not as I don't know it doesn't

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.059 
so it's not as I don't know it doesn't
seem<00:02:56.799> as<00:02:57.040> new<00:02:57.370> be<00:02:57.579> in<00:02:57.930> modern<00:02:58.930> warfare<00:02:59.109> 3<00:02:59.379> as<00:02:59.919> it

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
swaying recoil I guess are going to be

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.979 
swaying recoil I guess are going to be
satisfied<00:03:05.230> to<00:03:05.379> a<00:03:05.409> certain<00:03:05.769> extent<00:03:06.180> also<00:03:07.180> our

missile and attack helicopter I'm just
saying<00:03:26.859> you<00:03:27.099> know<00:03:27.189> hypothetically<00:03:27.459> if<00:03:28.030> you

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
saying you know hypothetically if you

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.729 
saying you know hypothetically if you
don't<00:03:29.620> die<00:03:29.979> and<00:03:30.400> you<00:03:31.239> let's<00:03:32.139> say<00:03:32.259> you<00:03:32.319> achieve

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
don't die and you let's say you achieve

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.649 
don't die and you let's say you achieve
that<00:03:32.769> seven<00:03:33.400> kill<00:03:33.669> streak<00:03:33.970> and<00:03:34.180> then<00:03:34.389> you<00:03:34.509> go

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:34.659 
that seven kill streak and then you go

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:36.749 
that seven kill streak and then you go
again<00:03:35.139> you<00:03:35.799> know<00:03:35.829> you<00:03:35.949> don't<00:03:36.250> die<00:03:36.430> and<00:03:36.669> then

heli<00:03:44.500> so<00:03:45.159> I<00:03:45.519> mean<00:03:45.939> that<00:03:46.750> might<00:03:47.139> be<00:03:47.379> a<00:03:47.409> good<00:03:47.500> idea

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
heli so I mean that might be a good idea

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:48.869 
heli so I mean that might be a good idea
I<00:03:48.040> don't<00:03:48.250> know<00:03:48.310> how<00:03:48.430> it's<00:03:48.609> going<00:03:48.759> to<00:03:48.819> work

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 
I don't know how it's going to work

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:51.449 
I don't know how it's going to work
really<00:03:49.629> because<00:03:50.349> if<00:03:50.500> I<00:03:50.590> stack<00:03:50.889> up<00:03:51.069> on<00:03:51.250> let's

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
really because if I stack up on let's

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.569 
really because if I stack up on let's
say<00:03:51.579> pave<00:03:51.819> lows<00:03:53.099> shit's<00:03:54.099> gonna<00:03:54.250> hit<00:03:54.400> the<00:03:54.459> fan

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
say pave lows shit's gonna hit the fan

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.490 
say pave lows shit's gonna hit the fan
so<00:03:55.030> there's<00:03:55.209> gonna<00:03:55.299> be<00:03:55.479> well<00:03:55.900> actually<00:03:56.079> it

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
so there's gonna be well actually it

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.809 
so there's gonna be well actually it
doesn't<00:03:56.680> it<00:03:56.979> shouldn't<00:03:57.340> even<00:03:57.370> matter<00:03:57.549> because

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
doesn't it shouldn't even matter because

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.360 
doesn't it shouldn't even matter because
you<00:03:58.299> can<00:03:58.689> only<00:03:58.780> have<00:03:58.959> one<00:03:59.019> pavelow<00:03:59.409> up<00:03:59.979> in<00:04:00.250> the

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
you can only have one pavelow up in the

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.689 
you can only have one pavelow up in the
air<00:04:00.459> so<00:04:00.790> that's<00:04:01.329> not<00:04:01.479> really<00:04:01.629> a<00:04:01.780> problem

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:02.699 
air so that's not really a problem

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:05.069 
air so that's not really a problem
another<00:04:03.699> thing<00:04:03.909> that<00:04:03.939> I<00:04:04.120> noticed<00:04:04.479> they<00:04:04.750> didn't

00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:06.759 
really cover their death streaks

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:10.679 
really cover their death streaks
