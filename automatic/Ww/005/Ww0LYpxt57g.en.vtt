 carglass repairs carglass swaps 

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:07.859
 supernova glass panes 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.719
 after the welcome of the examiner always 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.700
 First, whether a repair of the disc 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.559
 this is possible as in this case 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.540
 the disc does not have to be replaced 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.190
 any damage is controlled 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.260
 and recorded in a log 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.210
 now it's time to start sitting and enjoy 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.230
 Put on gloves and then check the 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.760
 technicians once the 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.099
 windshield wipers and the rain are like that 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.510
 works in the squad , by the way 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.130
 we always have the servicemobile 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.160
 complete technology from ours 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.210
 service centers on the gts 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.120
 Slice table becomes the new slice 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.969
 prepared and the carglass lpx 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.010
 technology attached to it no 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.510
 technician the washer later effortlessly and 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.930
 accurate to the millimeter in the right position 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.930
 bring 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:52.710
 the mudguards already protect the paint 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:55.190
 Before scratches the dashboard 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.449
 cover the dashboard 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.559
 So now that are in disguises 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:06.210
 be careful because behind it 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.680
 He changed rearview mirror and rain sensor 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.590
 from the old to the new disc 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.680
 Mount high windshield wiper as well 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.270
 although remove it during use 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.890
 the isi was not a scratch on 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.240
 dashboard arise the nuz 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.240
 carglass special protective cover 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.410
 with a special tool leads the 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.120
 technicians start the advice from the outside 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:37.660
 inside through the seal and attached 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:39.400
 they amisia now the advice from the outside 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.680
 along the clearing along the disc 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.840
 laid and the end with tape at the 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.250
 disc gently fastened it 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.880
 the wire through the seal on the 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.979
 celebrate easy 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.780
 Once she had to be implemented 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.390
 so that the wire becomes the seal 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.100
 completely by separating can the carglass 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.720
 By the way, easy is like most 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.860
 other carglass technologies one 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.420
 Development from the research center 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:04.050
 Our parent company can then rely 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.490
 the broken disc will be removed 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.070
 altenlotheim glue on the body 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.440
 Cut back to 2 mm and clean 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.120
 be with our special activator 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:18.640
 the adhesive surface thus activates the 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:20.950
 One hundred percent glue sticks to the ksb 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.810
 components glue on the disk and 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.209
 already she can with the lpx technology 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.810
 accurately and precisely positioned 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.970
 become 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.220
 the technician see 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.280
 one then all removed parts 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.890
 attached to the car again 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.120
 trim strips are glued and the 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.510
 cover the A-pillars again 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.510
 bolted 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.950
 now the rain sensor of the 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.330
 behind the rearview mirror is attached 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.780
 connected and also functions 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.930
 checked 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.760
 the new disc is being cleaned 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.190
 and the completed guarantee trailer 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.660
 hanged on the rear-view mirror the last 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.180
 Adhesive tapes and protective mats are 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.709
 removed ready after two hours 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.769
 signs the satisfied carglass 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:06.420
 Customer the delivery protocol perfect the 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.420
 slices of new ones at carglass 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.480
