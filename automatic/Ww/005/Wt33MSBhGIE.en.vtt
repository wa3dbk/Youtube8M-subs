00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.749 
get host probably around fifty percent
of<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:57.990> games<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.409> ever<00:01:58.530> play<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.610> that

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
of the games that I ever play so that

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.749 
of the games that I ever play so that
helps<00:02:00.000> me<00:02:00.060> out<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.299> lot<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.810> what<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:01.829> do<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.310> I

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
helps me out a lot and what I do and I

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.499 
helps me out a lot and what I do and I
never<00:02:03.570> ever<00:02:03.810> drop<00:02:04.740> party<00:02:05.100> members<00:02:05.460> what<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.390> do

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
never ever drop party members what I do

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.410 
never ever drop party members what I do
is<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.960> go<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.580> settings<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:08.910> switch<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.390> to

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
is I go to settings and I switch it to

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.690 
is I go to settings and I switch it to
local<00:02:09.780> only<00:02:10.200> so<00:02:10.770> when<00:02:10.920> you're<00:02:11.039> in<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.459> pregame

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
local only so when you're in the pregame

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.150 
local only so when you're in the pregame
lobby<00:02:12.200> you<00:02:13.200> press<00:02:13.440> select

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
lobby you press select

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.430 
lobby you press select
and<00:02:14.340> it'll<00:02:15.000> say<00:02:15.270> if<00:02:15.300> you<00:02:15.660> want<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:15.930> have<00:02:16.290> it

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
and it'll say if you want to have it

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.890 
and it'll say if you want to have it
open<00:02:16.920> I<00:02:17.040> believe<00:02:17.400> you<00:02:18.120> want<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:18.360> have<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.510> local

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
open I believe you want to have a local

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.870 
open I believe you want to have a local
first<00:02:19.470> or<00:02:19.740> something<00:02:20.010> like<00:02:20.070> that<00:02:20.190> along<00:02:20.730> those

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
first or something like that along those

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.690 
first or something like that along those
lines<00:02:21.180> or<00:02:21.420> local<00:02:21.870> only<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.500> I<00:02:22.890> go<00:02:23.070> local<00:02:23.520> only

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
lines or local only and I go local only

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.720 
lines or local only and I go local only
and<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.540> reasoning<00:02:24.990> I<00:02:25.200> do<00:02:25.350> this<00:02:25.800> is<00:02:26.040> that<00:02:26.610> that

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
and the reasoning I do this is that that

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.640 
and the reasoning I do this is that that
matches<00:02:27.090> me<00:02:27.240> up<00:02:27.330> with<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.510> host<00:02:27.780> from<00:02:28.170> someone

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
matches me up with a host from someone

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.510 
matches me up with a host from someone
within<00:02:28.950> let's<00:02:29.370> just<00:02:29.550> say<00:02:30.860> 100<00:02:31.860> miles<00:02:32.100> from<00:02:32.340> me

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
within let's just say 100 miles from me

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.370 
within let's just say 100 miles from me
and<00:02:32.730> it'll<00:02:33.300> look<00:02:33.510> there<00:02:33.810> first<00:02:34.080> before

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
and it'll look there first before

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.280 
and it'll look there first before
branching<00:02:35.070> out<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.220> farther<00:02:36.060> distances<00:02:36.630> so

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
branching out to farther distances so

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.200 
branching out to farther distances so
you'll<00:02:37.470> get<00:02:37.680> into<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:37.980> game<00:02:38.190> with<00:02:38.910> a<00:02:38.940> better

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
you'll get into a game with a better

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.710 
you'll get into a game with a better
host<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:40.070> better<00:02:41.070> yet<00:02:41.370> it<00:02:41.970> won't<00:02:42.210> drop<00:02:42.540> as

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
host and better yet it won't drop as

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.230 
host and better yet it won't drop as
many<00:02:42.870> people<00:02:43.350> even<00:02:43.620> if<00:02:43.890> people<00:02:44.310> are<00:02:44.430> in<00:02:44.610> let's

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
many people even if people are in let's

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.420 
many people even if people are in let's
just<00:02:45.300> say<00:02:45.770> someone's<00:02:46.770> in<00:02:46.920> West<00:02:47.160> Coast

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
just say someone's in West Coast

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.010 
just say someone's in West Coast
someone's<00:02:47.760> in<00:02:47.850> east<00:02:48.060> coast<00:02:48.300> of<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.540> states<00:02:48.870> or

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
someone's in east coast of the states or

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.560 
someone's in east coast of the states or
canada<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:50.070> won't<00:02:50.370> drop<00:02:50.610> them<00:02:50.880> either<00:02:51.030> unless

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
canada it won't drop them either unless

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.600 
canada it won't drop them either unless
you're<00:02:51.870> someone<00:02:52.500> from<00:02:52.650> England<00:02:53.130> and<00:02:53.310> someone

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
you're someone from England and someone

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.270 
you're someone from England and someone
from<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:54.720> United<00:02:55.020> States<00:02:55.260> I<00:02:55.590> could<00:02:56.100> see

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
from the United States I could see

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.520 
from the United States I could see
people<00:02:56.430> drop<00:02:56.910> in<00:02:57.120> for<00:02:57.540> sure<00:02:57.810> with<00:02:58.140> that<00:02:58.320> method

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
people drop in for sure with that method

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.260 
people drop in for sure with that method
but<00:02:59.370> from<00:03:00.180> this<00:03:00.300> method<00:03:00.780> I<00:03:00.900> probably<00:03:01.590> drop

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
but from this method I probably drop

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.320 
but from this method I probably drop
once<00:03:03.270> every<00:03:03.960> day<00:03:04.140> so<00:03:04.800> far<00:03:04.860> so<00:03:05.460> that's<00:03:05.640> nothing

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
once every day so far so that's nothing

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.960 
once every day so far so that's nothing
compared<00:03:06.750> to<00:03:06.840> what<00:03:06.960> people<00:03:07.230> are<00:03:07.350> experiencing

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
compared to what people are experiencing

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.510 
compared to what people are experiencing
when<00:03:08.970> I<00:03:09.030> was<00:03:09.270> in<00:03:09.420> a<00:03:09.540> party<00:03:10.410> of<00:03:10.590> i<00:03:11.220> think<00:03:11.400> it<00:03:11.460> was

literally took i think it was 20 minutes
getting<00:03:17.790> into<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.060> game<00:03:18.330> until<00:03:18.750> we<00:03:19.350> finally<00:03:19.800> did

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
getting into a game until we finally did

supposed to go on local only but that

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.760 
supposed to go on local only but that

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
giving suggestions this is just as

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.420 
giving suggestions this is just as
suggestions<00:03:53.090> to<00:03:54.090> any<00:03:54.480> one<00:03:54.750> or<00:03:55.350> two<00:03:55.890> let's<00:03:56.250> just

suggestions to any one or two let's just

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.520 
suggestions to any one or two let's just
say<00:03:56.640> a<00:03:57.200> developer<00:03:58.200> because<00:03:59.480> this<00:04:00.480> game<00:04:00.810> is<00:04:00.870> so

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
say a developer because this game is so

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.860 
say a developer because this game is so
awesome<00:04:01.770> but<00:04:02.250> there's<00:04:02.910> some<00:04:03.180> tiny<00:04:03.510> things

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
awesome but there's some tiny things

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.479 
awesome but there's some tiny things
that<00:04:04.050> could<00:04:04.230> get<00:04:04.410> changed<00:04:04.890> and<00:04:04.950> that<00:04:05.280> would

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
that could get changed and that would

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.570 
that could get changed and that would
make<00:04:06.090> the<00:04:06.239> game<00:04:06.450> that<00:04:06.810> much<00:04:07.020> better<00:04:07.320> first<00:04:08.280> off

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
make the game that much better first off

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.870 
make the game that much better first off
I'll<00:04:08.820> start<00:04:09.300> with<00:04:09.540> the<00:04:09.900> lowest<00:04:10.440> killstreak<00:04:11.010> RC

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
I'll start with the lowest killstreak RC

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.420 
I'll start with the lowest killstreak RC
car<00:04:12.150> um<00:04:12.840> I<00:04:13.650> don't<00:04:14.310> know<00:04:14.570> RC<00:04:15.570> cars<00:04:15.870> seem<00:04:16.290> a<00:04:16.500> bit<00:04:16.530> a

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
car um I don't know RC cars seem a bit a

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.360 
car um I don't know RC cars seem a bit a
bit<00:04:17.760> too<00:04:18.180> easy<00:04:18.390> to<00:04:18.600> get<00:04:18.810> two<00:04:19.350> kills<00:04:19.650> two<00:04:20.070> kills

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
bit too easy to get two kills two kills

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.900 
bit too easy to get two kills two kills
is<00:04:20.609> nothing<00:04:21.090> to<00:04:21.270> get<00:04:21.419> an<00:04:21.480> RC<00:04:21.780> car<00:04:22.020> and<00:04:22.789> once<00:04:23.789> you

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
is nothing to get an RC car and once you

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.210 
is nothing to get an RC car and once you
have<00:04:24.030> those<00:04:24.180> two<00:04:24.419> kills<00:04:24.720> an<00:04:25.229> RC<00:04:25.680> car<00:04:25.950> is

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
have those two kills an RC car is

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.590 
have those two kills an RC car is
basically<00:04:26.520> i<00:04:27.000> guaran--

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
basically i guaran--

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.050 
basically i guaran--
she'd<00:04:27.780> kill<00:04:28.110> every<00:04:28.620> single<00:04:28.650> time<00:04:29.250> and<00:04:29.550> that's

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
she'd kill every single time and that's

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.080 
she'd kill every single time and that's
you're<00:04:30.300> a<00:04:30.330> bit<00:04:30.750> of<00:04:30.780> a<00:04:31.470> drunk<00:04:31.740> driver<00:04:32.070> I<00:04:32.400> think

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
you're a bit of a drunk driver I think

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.540 
you're a bit of a drunk driver I think
that<00:04:33.150> you<00:04:33.450> can<00:04:33.660> manage<00:04:34.500> to<00:04:34.530> get<00:04:34.830> one<00:04:35.100> kill<00:04:35.370> out

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
that you can manage to get one kill out

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.540 
that you can manage to get one kill out
of<00:04:35.610> an<00:04:35.730> RC<00:04:36.060> car<00:04:36.270> on<00:04:36.980> basically<00:04:37.980> any<00:04:38.280> map

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
of an RC car on basically any map

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.150 
of an RC car on basically any map
weather<00:04:39.300> unless<00:04:39.810> you're<00:04:40.140> on<00:04:40.290> let's<00:04:40.980> just<00:04:41.010> say

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
weather unless you're on let's just say

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.100 
weather unless you're on let's just say
WMD<00:04:41.940> and<00:04:42.090> everybody's<00:04:42.450> cabinet<00:04:42.780> in<00:04:42.840> the<00:04:42.900> back

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
WMD and everybody's cabinet in the back

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.560 
WMD and everybody's cabinet in the back
or<00:04:43.350> something<00:04:43.440> but<00:04:43.860> an<00:04:44.580> RC<00:04:44.970> car<00:04:45.180> I<00:04:45.240> think<00:04:45.360> it

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
or something but an RC car I think it

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.620 
or something but an RC car I think it
last<00:04:45.750> 30<00:04:46.140> seconds<00:04:46.680> my<00:04:47.250> suggestion<00:04:47.760> would<00:04:48.570> be

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
last 30 seconds my suggestion would be

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.520 
last 30 seconds my suggestion would be
to<00:04:49.070> maybe<00:04:50.070> lower<00:04:50.850> the<00:04:51.120> timing<00:04:51.630> let's<00:04:52.290> just<00:04:52.350> say

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
to maybe lower the timing let's just say

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.560 
to maybe lower the timing let's just say
to<00:04:52.680> I<00:04:53.370> don't<00:04:53.940> know<00:04:54.440> 15<00:04:55.440> seconds<00:04:56.040> for<00:04:56.190> an<00:04:57.000> RC<00:04:57.330> car

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
to I don't know 15 seconds for an RC car

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.190 
to I don't know 15 seconds for an RC car
make<00:04:58.260> it<00:04:58.440> less<00:04:58.620> powerful<00:04:58.980> by<00:04:59.910> doing<00:05:00.450> that<00:05:00.690> not

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
make it less powerful by doing that not

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.830 
make it less powerful by doing that not
decreasing<00:05:01.830> the<00:05:02.460> range<00:05:03.090> or<00:05:03.330> anything<00:05:03.630> on<00:05:03.750> the

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
decreasing the range or anything on the

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.200 
decreasing the range or anything on the
gun<00:05:03.990> but<00:05:04.230> earth<00:05:04.560> on<00:05:04.980> a<00:05:05.010> killstreak<00:05:05.430> but

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
gun but earth on a killstreak but

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.740 
gun but earth on a killstreak but
possibly<00:05:06.660> doing<00:05:06.960> that<00:05:07.140> also<00:05:08.090> care<00:05:09.090> package<00:05:09.540> I

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
possibly doing that also care package I

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.620 
possibly doing that also care package I
know<00:05:10.410> I'll<00:05:11.250> I'm<00:05:11.730> using<00:05:11.910> the<00:05:12.090> care<00:05:12.240> bags<00:05:12.450> right

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
know I'll I'm using the care bags right

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.560 
know I'll I'm using the care bags right
now<00:05:12.780> as<00:05:12.900> I<00:05:13.020> say<00:05:13.200> that<00:05:13.410> go<00:05:13.800> figure<00:05:14.040> and<00:05:14.480> what<00:05:15.480> I'm

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
now as I say that go figure and what I'm

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.150 
now as I say that go figure and what I'm
saying<00:05:15.810> is<00:05:15.900> with<00:05:16.110> care<00:05:16.320> package<00:05:16.680> is<00:05:16.920> the

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
saying is with care package is the

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.680 
saying is with care package is the
hardline<00:05:17.760> pro<00:05:18.530> that<00:05:19.530> combination<00:05:19.950> is<00:05:20.690> so

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
hardline pro that combination is so

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.180 
hardline pro that combination is so
lethal<00:05:22.320> it's<00:05:22.830> not<00:05:23.040> even<00:05:23.220> funny<00:05:23.780> because<00:05:24.780> I<00:05:25.290> can

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
lethal it's not even funny because I can

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.350 
lethal it's not even funny because I can
run<00:05:26.480> care<00:05:27.480> package<00:05:27.900> I<00:05:28.170> can<00:05:28.920> run<00:05:29.190> sentry<00:05:30.180> gun

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
run care package I can run sentry gun

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.770 
run care package I can run sentry gun
and<00:05:30.600> I<00:05:30.750> can<00:05:30.960> run<00:05:31.260> Sam<00:05:32.190> turret<00:05:32.580> now<00:05:33.390> if<00:05:33.510> you<00:05:33.600> guys

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
and I can run Sam turret now if you guys

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.830 
and I can run Sam turret now if you guys
didn't<00:05:34.110> know<00:05:34.260> this<00:05:34.910> you<00:05:35.910> can<00:05:36.120> actually<00:05:36.480> switch

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
didn't know this you can actually switch

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.480 
didn't know this you can actually switch
all<00:05:37.110> three<00:05:37.680> of<00:05:37.710> those<00:05:38.040> you<00:05:38.730> can<00:05:38.910> call<00:05:39.090> in<00:05:39.270> three

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
all three of those you can call in three

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:46.160 
all three of those you can call in three
care<00:05:41.490> packages<00:05:42.560> basically<00:05:43.560> in<00:05:43.790> one<00:05:44.790> life<00:05:45.390> so

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:46.170 
care packages basically in one life so

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:47.560 
care packages basically in one life so
you<00:05:46.260> throw<00:05:46.560> down<00:05:46.740> all<00:05:47.040> those<00:05:47.220> care<00:05:47.490> packages

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:47.570 
you throw down all those care packages

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.510 
you throw down all those care packages
when<00:05:48.570> you<00:05:48.780> have<00:05:49.110> to<00:05:49.290> have<00:05:49.380> hardline<00:05:49.920> pro<00:05:50.160> and

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
when you have to have hardline pro and

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.640 
when you have to have hardline pro and
then<00:05:51.090> you<00:05:51.360> can<00:05:51.540> actually<00:05:51.840> double<00:05:51.960> tap<00:05:52.290> x<00:05:52.500> on

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
then you can actually double tap x on

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.520 
then you can actually double tap x on
each<00:05:52.860> individual<00:05:53.790> one<00:05:53.850> even<00:05:54.660> Sam<00:05:54.960> turret<00:05:55.290> and

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
each individual one even Sam turret and

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.370 
each individual one even Sam turret and
it'll<00:05:56.280> switch<00:05:56.550> it<00:05:56.730> to<00:05:56.760> a<00:05:56.970> random<00:05:57.210> thing<00:05:57.660> so<00:05:58.320> you

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
it'll switch it to a random thing so you

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.510 
it'll switch it to a random thing so you
can<00:05:58.650> have<00:05:58.890> three<00:05:59.250> chances<00:05:59.580> at<00:06:00.060> a<00:06:00.390> gunship<00:06:00.930> I

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
can have three chances at a gunship I

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.540 
can have three chances at a gunship I
don't<00:06:02.520> know<00:06:02.640> that<00:06:03.390> just<00:06:03.570> seems<00:06:03.780> a<00:06:03.930> tiny<00:06:04.170> bit

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 
don't know that just seems a tiny bit

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.790 
don't know that just seems a tiny bit
overkill<00:06:05.550> if<00:06:06.030> you<00:06:06.270> ask<00:06:06.450> me<00:06:06.690> although<00:06:07.530> i'm

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
overkill if you ask me although i'm

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.150 
overkill if you ask me although i'm
using<00:06:08.160> in<00:06:08.280> this<00:06:08.370> game<00:06:08.640> so<00:06:09.240> i<00:06:09.270> shouldn't<00:06:09.840> be<00:06:10.160> why

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 
using in this game so i shouldn't be why

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.220 
using in this game so i shouldn't be why
I'm<00:06:11.430> not<00:06:11.700> really<00:06:11.850> whining<00:06:12.330> but<00:06:12.810> I<00:06:12.870> shouldn't

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:13.230 
I'm not really whining but I shouldn't

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.700 
I'm not really whining but I shouldn't
be<00:06:13.410> talking<00:06:13.920> about<00:06:14.220> it<00:06:14.460> um<00:06:15.180> I<00:06:15.990> think<00:06:16.140> I'm<00:06:16.560> going

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710 
be talking about it um I think I'm going

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.610 
be talking about it um I think I'm going
to<00:06:16.770> be<00:06:16.860> running<00:06:17.400> that<00:06:17.640> for<00:06:18.000> a<00:06:18.030> bit<00:06:18.380> the<00:06:19.380> only

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 
to be running that for a bit the only

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.560 
to be running that for a bit the only
downfall<00:06:19.830> all<00:06:20.160> about<00:06:20.430> care<00:06:20.640> packages<00:06:21.180> which

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:21.570 
downfall all about care packages which

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.500 
downfall all about care packages which
kind<00:06:21.870> of<00:06:21.960> makes<00:06:22.200> it<00:06:22.580> less<00:06:23.580> powerful<00:06:23.910> is<00:06:24.240> the

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510 
kind of makes it less powerful is the

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.870 
kind of makes it less powerful is the
fact<00:06:24.870> that<00:06:24.990> people<00:06:25.590> can<00:06:25.800> now<00:06:25.950> booby<00:06:26.370> trap<00:06:26.640> them

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 
fact that people can now booby trap them

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.820 
fact that people can now booby trap them
so<00:06:27.450> once<00:06:27.720> you<00:06:27.870> started<00:06:28.140> getting<00:06:28.380> to<00:06:28.560> the<00:06:28.650> later

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830 
so once you started getting to the later

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.800 
so once you started getting to the later
stages<00:06:29.160> the<00:06:29.430> game<00:06:29.640> I<00:06:29.670> think<00:06:29.820> more<00:06:30.240> people<00:06:30.390> will

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.810 
stages the game I think more people will

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.470 
stages the game I think more people will
have<00:06:31.380> on<00:06:31.560> hacker<00:06:31.770> pro<00:06:32.220> and<00:06:32.520> it'll<00:06:33.150> be<00:06:33.210> booby

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:33.480 
have on hacker pro and it'll be booby

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.409 
have on hacker pro and it'll be booby
trap<00:06:33.720> in<00:06:33.900> your<00:06:34.250> care<00:06:35.250> packages<00:06:35.760> also<00:06:36.000> if

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:36.419 
trap in your care packages also if

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:38.210 
trap in your care packages also if
you're<00:06:36.540> playing<00:06:36.720> any<00:06:37.050> team<00:06:37.500> deathmatch<00:06:37.979> or

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 
you're playing any team deathmatch or

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.300 
you're playing any team deathmatch or
even<00:06:38.520> some<00:06:38.760> domination<00:06:39.479> the<00:06:40.140> spawns<00:06:40.530> flips<00:06:40.919> so

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.310 
even some domination the spawns flips so

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:41.629 
even some domination the spawns flips so
much

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 
much

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:43.459 
much
so<00:06:42.210> if<00:06:42.330> you're<00:06:42.449> calm<00:06:42.689> down<00:06:42.900> that<00:06:43.080> care<00:06:43.289> back

00:06:43.459 --> 00:06:43.469 
so if you're calm down that care back

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:46.100 
so if you're calm down that care back
package<00:06:44.129> you<00:06:44.939> need<00:06:45.120> to<00:06:45.240> guarantee<00:06:45.479> that
