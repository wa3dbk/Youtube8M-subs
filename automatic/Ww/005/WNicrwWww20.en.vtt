00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:04.600
 the past 300 years struggling to talk 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:09.219
 2011 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:12.049
 bourjos 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.049
 dozens of fans 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:18.989
 cross for what 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:24.709
 to end up opening my head when sliding with the blood of a joker 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:30.199
 so now the task of defending this strength lies in 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.500
 I learned 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.650
 the arcade games of the xbox baza the former hanna better for those who seek 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:39.950
 fast fun 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.030
 the offer is almost endless 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.120
 and the value for money could not be better 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.340
 take a look at what's coming because very possibly jose abascal about 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.090
 how many microsoft points 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.860
 the earthquake was a master 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.430
 he was the worst of the students stupid pazos oxygenation telecom 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.020
 to concentrate on the basics 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.950
 that's why the order was not matched 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.240
 sent the best to learn from the most patient wizards 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.340
 and I stayed with the works 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.530
 powers more dhabi is a gambling decency interaction in real time 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.170
 as something essential 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.070
 for explaining it quickly is how to combine fantastic plans see your 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.760
 mens 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.850
 with an action game jaca islands any 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.850
 the operation is very basic 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.420
 whatever the environment there will always be a luminous portal one end 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.440
 ovaries 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.520
 and a few entries that the orcs enter 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.690
 your only mission is to prevent them from sneaking into the portals like this 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:40.670
 simple 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.790
 the game is divided into three acts 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.770
 each act has several scenarios and within each tennis scenario in 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.460
 have between 6 and 10 hours of orcs 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.600
 busts main branches on a sword and a crossbow 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.009
 but that sum is traps and sorcerers that will select I made before giving way 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.590
 at the first hour 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.880
 those elections may take as long as you look and once you have it and you 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.370
 You will be able to inspect the stage in search of the most 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.250
 efficient and economical to arrange your traps once I asked the 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.990
 Antillean that will happen if the draws went through the cracks to enter 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.560
 our world January 3 with av 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.179
 the forward negredo 

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:21.169
 in spite of the strength where he explores his world of nightmares nor the hamas 

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:25.359
 look for narrow steps where barricades are available that are good for 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:26.139
 bows 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:29.299
 areas with falls that leave the push machines 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.819
 long distances so that boston archers can shoot arrows and that 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.040
 they are bothered and of course spikes hidden in the ground arrows in the 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.859
 walls 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:41.249
 and mud that delays the advance of the beasts among many other things 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:45.549
 strong rains 

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:49.129
 among the workers 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:53.109
 your only limitation at this point will be the money spent 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:57.259
 the idea is to find a way to optimize capital to the maximum extent 

00:02:57.259 --> 00:03:00.319
 that the skype machines the more work the better 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.549
 as they go out the costs high levels of buying money 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.139
 obviously if they fall efficiently and efficiently is the head with the 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:11.139
 crossbow the amount you would receive and it will be higher 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:15.779
 between Ã³rale horda you will have 12 seconds of clock in which to add 

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:18.249
 remove as see trap without stress 

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:22.669
 and at least once in each scenario you will be given a break and limited starting 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:25.289
 from which things will get much more tense 

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:28.679
 and a good amount of money to invest in receiving the orcs 

00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:30.479
 have to get there 

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:33.639
 At the end of each screen you will receive a new toy 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:37.169
 and between one and five skulls depending on how well you have it 

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:38.079
 and it has been done 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:41.569
 these skulls erasmo this currency to get improvements for the 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.569
 traps you have and sedimentary 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.149
 no more pretension than to entertain short-term presents this ortiz 

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:52.029
 more damage 

00:03:52.029 --> 00:03:55.279
 offers a perfect balance between strategy and action 

00:03:55.279 --> 00:03:58.969
 and a curve of aggressive difficulty that will make you lose the notion of 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:01.829
 time with the command stuck in your hands 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:04.599
 certainly a highly recommended purchase 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.599
 the world is still with him 

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:14.099
 and it would be a joke in bad taste is the last one left
