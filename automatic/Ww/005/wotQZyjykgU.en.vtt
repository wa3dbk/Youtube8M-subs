00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:11.370
 It is information about the number of positive and negative Let's open Yes Here attached to the multiplication It is information that is, multiplication 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.960
 Of course I will learn multiplication when I am in elementary school, but here 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.060
 I learned in junior high school 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.540
 This minus 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:23.520
 You're studying about multiplication that involves this 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:25.080
 But when thinking about this multiplication, even though there are some simple points or tips, it is 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:31.919
 When this say if you want to 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:33.420
 It's good to do a separate plus or minus millionaire of judgment and I put 5 only calculation of this figure 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:35.050
 Therefore, it has a say 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.680
 Because of that four these four 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:43.620
 Please hold firmly here 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.850
 What is said about this multiplication and this plus and minus multiplication is what happens to this Pramai 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.340
 Hey 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.980
 Please see this first + + + + will be plus and minus also minus 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:57.170
 Become a plus 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:01:00.220
 + Multiplying minus multiplied by minus become a minus + was larger and becomes negative 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:05.470
 Though it may be complicated, though 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:07.760
 It becomes a plus if you apply the same sign as ++ or minus man same sign 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:12.890
 And different wealth 5 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:18.350
 It will be a negative if you spend a different millionaire with a minus, a plus, a plus or minus 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:20.630
 It is easy to think so and if you combine this rich man judgment and numerical calculation, the answer is 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:25.610
 I will see specifically when I get out 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.780
 This + To make + if from or say when you first millionaire determine + applying plaster think 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.780
 What happens 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:33.360
 Over the same wind 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:35.350
 From today on, this will be a plus, and how many numbers will it take to calculate the next digit 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.460
 Will be 6 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:43.659
 Multiplying cortex's minus Over Troubled Water such Fu is you You're next same do the dance 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:48.280
 It is also minus Turner + But Is minus this is a plus 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:54.460
 And it's been decided that this will become a lock 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:58.470
 The next time is so + it will be put on every morning + it will be minus 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:04.170
 And say that's put brother will flock 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:06.030
 In applied to the meeting west 5- 6 plus Now this is also minus multiplied by + is negative and in 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.550
 Mr. Kage is 6 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.760
 It's going to determine the Fu say 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:15.870
 And last 0 k -2 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:19.380
 This Troubled Natten I, for example, + even in elementary school 0 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:23.430
 It's zero if you put 00 over sleepy 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:28.020
 This is still to 0 to minus to apply a zero because it is together at minus 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.540
 Well, let's say it's like saying that after hanging on the f number, calculate the numbers 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.459
 To do so 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:35.019
 Bailly even only it's Hey plus of this millionaire or plus was + and + Ã— -3- is this 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.950
 Hamou is good at memorization 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.790
 I hope that I do not think about the difficult things in the year and I want to take such rules and faces as well 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.450
 think 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:46.989
 I will be able to do that, so let's actually see 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.560
 For example, when you think about Car Kouichi how to think this, School 1 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:53.090
 First of all, let's judge a millionaire 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:56.480
 + + + 8 and 3 + 15 bars 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:01.550
 It is in the intervertebral foramen will continue to judgment in such Fu 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:04.770
 It is a plus minus minus minus is plus and it is eight episodes which are multiplied to the calculation of the number 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:11.430
 16 This is how you do it 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:13.290
 No. 3 is similar + multiplying minus is doing this doing in the Mr. multiplying minus prevent 4 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.340
 I will go there 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:23.580
 Minus multiplied by + is multiplied by minus No. 7 35 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:24.760
 The number of information multiplication of I and the last I only go to do this very ne basic government here 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.620
 I studied about 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.189
 Sounds of what I'm doing here after the sound of the accident It becomes so important in mathematics from junior high school 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.299
 I Nde come 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:36.780
 Be sure to master and find a leader to sleep for that and practice well 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.780
 Let's leave it
