that<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.850> disappointing<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:16.080> would<00:01:16.200> definitely

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
that is disappointing I would definitely

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.480 
that is disappointing I would definitely
say<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:17.750> Paul<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.170> original<00:01:19.530> owner<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.310> would

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
say is Paul the original owner I would

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.810 
say is Paul the original owner I would
assume<00:01:20.729> he<00:01:20.880> was<00:01:20.970> like<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.090> size<00:01:21.330> 8<00:01:21.600> your<00:01:21.840> size<00:01:22.049> 9

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
assume he was like a size 8 your size 9

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.030 
assume he was like a size 8 your size 9
he<00:01:23.820> was<00:01:23.850> wearing<00:01:24.210> these<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:24.799> they're<00:01:25.799> kind<00:01:25.979> of

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
he was wearing these so they're kind of

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.890 
he was wearing these so they're kind of
stretched<00:01:26.310> out<00:01:26.549> but<00:01:26.939> it's<00:01:27.270> cool<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.780> know

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
hopefully over time they'll kind of get

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.749 
hopefully over time they'll kind of get
back<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.810> their<00:01:30.930> normal<00:01:31.079> shape<00:01:31.490> here<00:01:32.490> they<00:01:32.640> are
