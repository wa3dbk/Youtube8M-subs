00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.150
 hello friends now I'm going to teach you 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:21.740
 save an image in pixels on 4 the 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:24.240
 photo pain x 6 if we do not start more than 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.170
 nothing we open our program 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:31.010
 now we look for the image 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:34.119
 in my case I will choose it to choose this 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.119
 more than anything 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.370
 once we have opened our 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.530
 image what we are going to do is export 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.530
 We are going to export it 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.770
 and we keep it that hunger that with the 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.380
 name that we want if in jpg we give to 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.850
 to export 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.550
 yes 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.710
 I did not just go out to this little window 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.840
 we are going to give him high here he stays 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.730
 standard 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:05.350
 and here we're going to uncheck this box 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.350
 and we will give it in pixels 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:12.230
 Now we are going to give the measure, I'm going 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.230
 to give in 1280 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.590
 by 720 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:24.290
 720 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:26.950
 If here is already 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.330
 nothing else we accept 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:33.050
 we have left 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:37.450
 for to do if now we do not open 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:39.950
 this is in my images 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.460
 Photos 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.369
 and here is 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.760
 tailored to the uar of the 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.270
 measure of my monitor to put it as 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.520
 this screen saver 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.619
 that our would be all friends for 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:00.070
