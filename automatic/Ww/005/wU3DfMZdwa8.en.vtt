I said before this is it's very similar
to<00:02:45.970> the<00:02:46.180> one<00:02:46.330> in<00:02:46.360> the<00:02:46.630> monster<00:02:46.930> truck

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080

transporter<00:02:47.740> just<00:02:48.550> a<00:02:48.640> few<00:02:48.850> different

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
transporter just a few different

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.930 
transporter just a few different
variations<00:02:49.750> on<00:02:50.020> it<00:02:50.490> but<00:02:51.490> it's<00:02:51.610> cool<00:02:51.790> because

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
variations on it but it's cool because

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.080 
variations on it but it's cool because
now<00:02:52.240> if<00:02:52.750> you've<00:02:52.990> got<00:02:53.230> that<00:02:53.440> set<00:02:53.740> you<00:02:54.520> can<00:02:54.640> you

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
now if you've got that set you can you

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.210 
now if you've got that set you can you
know<00:02:55.180> have<00:02:55.420> it<00:02:55.630> set<00:02:55.870> up<00:02:56.020> and<00:02:56.200> you<00:02:56.410> can<00:02:56.560> race<00:02:56.740> two

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
know have it set up and you can race two

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.860 
know have it set up and you can race two
different<00:02:57.670> monster<00:02:58.060> truck<00:02:58.270> so<00:02:58.450> you<00:02:58.540> can<00:02:58.660> kind

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
different monster truck so you can kind

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.960 
different monster truck so you can kind
of<00:02:58.959> have<00:02:59.050> a<00:02:59.110> monster<00:02:59.440> truck<00:02:59.740> rally<00:03:00.069> so<00:03:00.760> I<00:03:00.790> think

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
of have a monster truck rally so I think

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.910
