00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.440 

anal<00:01:28.860> enema<00:01:29.220> which<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.939> don't<00:01:30.119> want<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.299> hear

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
anal enema which you don't want to hear

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.200 
anal enema which you don't want to hear
that<00:01:30.630> but<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:31.490> actually<00:01:32.490> have<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.060> do

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
that but you actually have to do

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.530 
that but you actually have to do
something<00:01:33.720> because<00:01:34.020> since<00:01:35.210> while<00:01:36.210> on<00:01:36.390> the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
something because since while on the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.359 
something because since while on the
water<00:01:36.689> fast<00:01:36.930> there<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.229> no<00:01:37.320> bowel<00:01:37.590> movement<00:01:38.100> so

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
water fast there is no bowel movement so

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.899

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
you have to take a oral laxative or in

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.030 
you have to take a oral laxative or in
my<00:01:42.090> case<00:01:42.150> an<00:01:42.509> inane<00:01:43.049> elec<00:01:43.350> there<00:01:43.590> are<00:01:43.740> anal

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040

my case an inane elec there are anal
enema<00:01:44.450> but<00:01:45.450> right<00:01:46.200> after<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:47.250> felt<00:01:47.460> great

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
enema but right after that it felt great

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.069 
enema but right after that it felt great
no<00:01:48.360> more<00:01:48.509> hunger<00:01:48.890> so<00:01:50.689> it<00:01:51.689> wasn't<00:01:51.960> bad<00:01:52.369> but<00:01:54.079> my

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079

amounts of energy so much energy it's

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.660 
amounts of energy so much energy it's
ridiculous<00:02:02.210> that's<00:02:03.210> why<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.450> like<00:02:04.040> 1564<00:02:05.040> 15

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
on the 16th and getting rid of them that

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.820 
on the 16th and getting rid of them that
that<00:02:22.370> was<00:02:22.460> pretty<00:02:22.640> much<00:02:22.820> the<00:02:23.150> worst<00:02:23.510> of<00:02:23.960> this

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
that was pretty much the worst of this

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.390 
that was pretty much the worst of this
week<00:02:25.130> but<00:02:25.750> yeah<00:02:26.750> I<00:02:26.840> was<00:02:27.020> really<00:02:27.920> close<00:02:28.160> to

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
week but yeah I was really close to

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.130 
week but yeah I was really close to
quitting<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:28.910> thank<00:02:29.780> God<00:02:29.960> I

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
quitting and thank God I

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.110 
quitting and thank God I
I<00:02:30.320> jumped<00:02:30.890> over<00:02:31.070> that<00:02:31.100> speed<00:02:31.490> bump<00:02:31.730> and<00:02:31.970> just

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
I jumped over that speed bump and just

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.430 
I jumped over that speed bump and just
kept<00:02:32.690> going<00:02:32.950> now<00:02:33.950> we're<00:02:34.160> on<00:02:34.250> day<00:02:34.400> 21<00:02:34.760> and

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
kept going now we're on day 21 and

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.770 
kept going now we're on day 21 and
feeling<00:02:36.440> great<00:02:36.620> I<00:02:36.860> love<00:02:37.220> it<00:02:37.400> I'm<00:02:38.390> gonna<00:02:38.540> try<00:02:38.750> to

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
feeling great I love it I'm gonna try to

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.710 
feeling great I love it I'm gonna try to
go<00:02:38.960> as<00:02:39.140> far<00:02:39.380> as<00:02:39.650> possible<00:02:39.680> I<00:02:40.250> mean<00:02:40.400> as<00:02:41.360> long<00:02:41.600> as

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
go as far as possible I mean as long as

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.810 
go as far as possible I mean as long as
I<00:02:41.780> don't<00:02:41.840> have<00:02:41.990> more<00:02:42.740> of<00:02:42.800> these<00:02:42.920> speed<00:02:43.280> bumps<00:02:43.310> I

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
I don't have more of these speed bumps I

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.750 
I don't have more of these speed bumps I
think<00:02:44.150> I<00:02:44.270> could<00:02:44.450> pretty<00:02:44.900> much<00:02:45.020> go<00:02:45.410> a<00:02:45.740> good<00:02:46.550> 80

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
think I could pretty much go a good 80

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.300 
think I could pretty much go a good 80

the heck let's see that's pretty much
the<00:02:53.690> gist<00:02:53.930> of<00:02:54.110> this<00:02:54.380> week<00:02:54.620> a<00:02:55.070> lot<00:02:56.060> of<00:02:56.210> energy<00:02:56.540> a

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
the gist of this week a lot of energy a

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.330 
the gist of this week a lot of energy a
little<00:02:57.470> bit<00:02:57.620> of<00:02:57.740> hunger<00:02:57.950> pains<00:03:00.340> everything

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
little bit of hunger pains everything

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.360 
little bit of hunger pains everything
else<00:03:01.580> my<00:03:02.090> blood<00:03:02.330> pressure<00:03:02.600> the<00:03:03.530> it<00:03:03.980> went<00:03:04.190> down

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
else my blood pressure the it went down

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.390 
else my blood pressure the it went down
again<00:03:04.760> so<00:03:05.290> I'm<00:03:06.290> at<00:03:06.530> 224<00:03:07.430> over<00:03:07.700> 77<00:03:08.510> which<00:03:09.500> the

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
again so I'm at 224 over 77 which the

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.510 
again so I'm at 224 over 77 which the
second<00:03:10.940> part<00:03:11.120> is<00:03:11.210> normal<00:03:11.750> range<00:03:11.990> I<00:03:12.530> think<00:03:13.490> I

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
second part is normal range I think I

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.640 
second part is normal range I think I
had<00:03:13.640> a<00:03:13.670> little<00:03:13.790> bit<00:03:13.970> of<00:03:14.060> salt<00:03:14.360> so<00:03:15.320> I<00:03:15.350> probably

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
had a little bit of salt so I probably

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.760 
had a little bit of salt so I probably
brought<00:03:15.980> my<00:03:16.220> my<00:03:17.090> 124<00:03:18.020> up<00:03:18.170> a<00:03:18.290> little<00:03:18.470> bit<00:03:18.620> from

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
brought my my 124 up a little bit from

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.120 
brought my my 124 up a little bit from
122<00:03:19.340> last<00:03:20.120> week<00:03:20.420> so<00:03:21.320> but<00:03:21.560> that's<00:03:21.650> no<00:03:21.830> big<00:03:21.860> deal

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130
