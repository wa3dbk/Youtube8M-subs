ground<00:05:30.690> out<00:05:30.870> right<00:05:31.050> there<00:05:31.229> maybe<00:05:31.409> he<00:05:31.590> was<00:05:31.740> just

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:31.889 
ground out right there maybe he was just

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:33.920 
ground out right there maybe he was just
buttering<00:05:32.280> me<00:05:32.490> up<00:05:32.520> for<00:05:33.270> when<00:05:33.389> we<00:05:33.510> faced<00:05:33.750> each

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
buttering me up for when we faced each

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.890 
buttering me up for when we faced each
other<00:05:34.110> either<00:05:34.530> way<00:05:34.860> we<00:05:35.639> ended<00:05:35.820> up<00:05:35.940> getting<00:05:36.539> to

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
other either way we ended up getting to

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.779 
other either way we ended up getting to
a<00:05:36.930> five<00:05:37.260> nothing<00:05:37.530> lead<00:05:37.740> on<00:05:38.070> the<00:05:38.220> red<00:05:38.430> so

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
a five nothing lead on the red so

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:41.420 
a five nothing lead on the red so
despite<00:05:39.389> my<00:05:39.630> best<00:05:39.840> efforts<00:05:40.050> we<00:05:40.830> still<00:05:41.070> got<00:05:41.250> to

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
despite my best efforts we still got to

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.129 
despite my best efforts we still got to
lead<00:05:41.639> and<00:05:42.120> right<00:05:42.270> there<00:05:42.510> I<00:05:42.720> don't<00:05:42.930> know<00:05:42.990> what

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 
lead and right there I don't know what

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:44.779 
lead and right there I don't know what
happened<00:05:43.169> but<00:05:43.590> I<00:05:43.650> get<00:05:43.889> an<00:05:43.979> RBI<00:05:44.280> and<00:05:44.550> they<00:05:44.639> move

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:44.789 
happened but I get an RBI and they move

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:46.430 
happened but I get an RBI and they move
up<00:05:45.000> a<00:05:45.090> base<00:05:45.300> so<00:05:45.539> I'm<00:05:45.659> guessing<00:05:45.840> I<00:05:46.050> beat<00:05:46.229> that

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
up a base so I'm guessing I beat that

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.649 
up a base so I'm guessing I beat that
one<00:05:46.590> in<00:05:46.740> the<00:05:46.889> ground<00:05:47.190> and<00:05:47.460> it<00:05:48.000> ended<00:05:48.180> up<00:05:48.270> going

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:48.659 
one in the ground and it ended up going

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:50.029 
one in the ground and it ended up going
through<00:05:48.900> somehow<00:05:49.199> I<00:05:49.349> thought<00:05:49.620> that<00:05:49.770> was<00:05:49.919> it

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 
through somehow I thought that was it

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:51.680 
through somehow I thought that was it
for<00:05:50.070> sure<00:05:50.430> out<00:05:50.729> but<00:05:51.000> it<00:05:51.090> was<00:05:51.180> kind<00:05:51.360> of<00:05:51.389> a<00:05:51.479> dirt

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
for sure out but it was kind of a dirt

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.290 
for sure out but it was kind of a dirt
on<00:05:51.900> their<00:05:52.530> part<00:05:52.770> that<00:05:53.340> happens<00:05:53.759> look<00:05:54.090> at<00:05:54.210> the

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
on their part that happens look at the

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.270 
on their part that happens look at the
score<00:05:54.630> 13<00:05:55.229> nothing<00:05:55.620> where<00:05:55.770> are<00:05:55.860> these<00:05:55.979> runs

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
score 13 nothing where are these runs

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.790 
score 13 nothing where are these runs
been<00:05:56.610> and<00:05:56.880> that<00:05:57.479> looks<00:05:57.870> like<00:05:58.110> it's<00:05:58.349> gonna<00:05:58.500> be<00:05:58.770> a

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
been and that looks like it's gonna be a

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.370
