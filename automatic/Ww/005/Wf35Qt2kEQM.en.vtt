enters<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.390> battlefield<00:00:48.510> reveal<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.170> top

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
enters the battlefield reveal the top

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.720 
enters the battlefield reveal the top
five<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.559> your<00:00:49.770> calves<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.280> opponent

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
five of your calves and opponent

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.160

separates<00:00:51.059> this<00:00:51.180> card<00:00:51.420> into<00:00:51.660> path<00:00:51.870> but<00:00:52.050> one

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
separates this card into path but one

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.720 
separates this card into path but one
pound<00:00:52.410> your<00:00:52.559> hand<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.890> other<00:00:52.920> mg<00:00:53.219> graveyard

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
pound your hand the other mg graveyard

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.770 
pound your hand the other mg graveyard
it<00:00:54.449> seems<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.750> bit<00:00:55.129> risky<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.489> me<00:00:56.520> because<00:00:56.850> if<00:00:57.090> if

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
it seems a bit risky to me because if if

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.689 
it seems a bit risky to me because if if
it<00:00:57.989> comes<00:00:58.199> out<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.500> have<00:00:58.590> Jace<00:00:58.890> Bellerin<00:00:59.489> and

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
it comes out you have Jace Bellerin and

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.369 
it comes out you have Jace Bellerin and
then<00:00:59.879> five<00:01:00.149> swamps<00:01:00.750> obvious<00:01:01.079> what<00:01:01.199> they<00:01:01.260> going

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
then five swamps obvious what they going

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.690 
then five swamps obvious what they going
to<00:01:01.440> put<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.649> their<00:01:02.449> graveyard<00:01:03.449> isn't<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:05.270> well

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
to put in their graveyard isn't it well

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:20.030 
to put in their graveyard isn't it well
every<00:01:08.700> card<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.090> downside<00:01:18.380> so<00:01:19.380> standard

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
every card is a downside so standard

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.350 
every card is a downside so standard
