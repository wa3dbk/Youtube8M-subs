00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello, I'm mar berrido mar berrÃ­o, dotcom 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:08.780
 I'm going to show you the new processor today 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:11.990
 intel core i7 59 30 k 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:17.000
 is the new generation of intel corp el 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:19.099
 soccer is the lg 2011 version 3 and good 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.880
 these are the ones that already work with 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:27.650
 memories ddr3 4 and come to replace the 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:30.289
 sandy bridge platform and iu 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.180
 which are from the platform of the elegy 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.670
 2011 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:39.420
 precisely this 59 30 k that I have here 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:47.489
 comes to replace the 49 30 here that was 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:52.500
 a processor of 3.4 giga hertz 12 mb of 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:55.440
 cache and the same six 12-core cores 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.269
 of processing that has the new 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.940
 version thinks that the box is 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:04.290
 exactly the same they come in no 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:08.680
 state without heatsink only the processor 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:11.690
 we found in these in these boxes 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:17.330
 in terms of cooling this comes 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:20.960
 with a TDP or power design 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:24.890
 140 watts contrary to 130 watts 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.710
 that came driving the 49 30 k then 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.170
 let's talk more about the platform the gea 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:35.360
 2011 version 3 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:38.600
 this 59 30 cabin 3.5 giga hertz 15 mb 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.750
 of cache which puts it in comparison 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:46.040
 with the top of the range we had 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:48.830
 before it was 49 60 x only 100 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:53.409
 megahertz below because that was 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:58.789
 3.6 giga hertz with the same 15 mb of 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:02:01.130
 cache the advantage here is that this when using 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:04.390
 memory ddr 4 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.390
 It has a bandwidth 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.340
 for the memory of 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.620
 about 10 gigabytes per second more than 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.290
 what the previous generation had and 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.210
 well the memories of seeing 4 are going to have 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.670
 speeds or are having speeds 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.090
 higher the base of these is 2 thousand 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.000
 133 megahertz 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.720
 when we talk about the ddr3 its base was 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.349
 of 1600 megahertz and they came up 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.629
 let's say what it indicated internal but they see 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:41.780
 ddr4 we are seeing memories of 3000 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:44.000
 3,200 megahertz ok the 59 30 k this is a 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.310
 processor that came with the same 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.510
 let's say with the same price range that 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.090
 the 49 30 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.030
 it is a replacement in terms of price 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.909
 exactly the same as motherboards 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:01.470
 who are going to use this processor are 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:04.799
 the x 99 because we have an asus of 1099 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.019
 de luxe then I'll show it but in 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.269
 price are replacing what exactly 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.790
 same in the USA about 600 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.040
 Dollars 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.060
 here in colombia and I guess the rest 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.790
 from Latin America around 750 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:24.859
 800 and some dollars are going to be 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:29.829
 costing and that puts it at 40% less 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:29.829
 of price than what it cost 49 60 x 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:37.420
 of what it costs 59 60 x which is the 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:41.100
 highest of these is a processor 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.100
 of 8 cores with 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:47.270
 16 processing threads but with one 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:51.170
 pretty much lower speed going back to 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:56.860
 this is 3.5 giga hertz 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.860
 its turbo speed is 3.7 giga hertz 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:05.270
 As I was telling you, he will use the 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:11.300
 platform x 99 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:14.600
 of intel and memory ddr 4 the idea 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:17.959
 it is also that also in the material 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:22.010
 servers this new socket the lg a 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:26.750
 2011 version 3 is replacing the 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:28.430
 previous 5 of the head 2011 so the 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.410
 new server platform too 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:34.880
 going to go with ddr4 was going to have say the 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:38.040
 the advantages especially in connectivity 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:42.670
 of the chipset 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:49.360
 equivalent for x 99 servers 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:54.520
 ok then that was the and 759 30 k of 3.5 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:58.840
 giga hertz 3.7 in turbo 15 mb cache and 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:00.880
 for the platform the g20 2011 version 3 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.190
 of intel I hope you liked the 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.840
 video that subscribe to the channel if 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.450
 have comments about this 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:10.900
 processor or questions about this new 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:13.630
 platform and they can leave me lasa and good 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.260
 I already have pending the memory ddr 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:21.520
 4 to tell you if it's worth it or not 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:23.920
 change memory so quickly I would say 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.460
 yes yes at least this platform is 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:29.680
 these new processors are say 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.000
 of the top of the intel line and they are 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.500
 processors that at least go to 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.670
 be about three years 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:40.800
 or more in the market so good 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:40.800
 subscribe to the channel see you next
