00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
technically these machine looking weird

arriving<00:00:41.399> in<00:00:41.760> well<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:42.930> episode<00:00:43.469> it's

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
revealed that Kouga is the actual

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.990 
revealed that Kouga is the actual
neighbor<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:47.100> creatures<00:00:47.700> that<00:00:47.730> are

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
neighbor and the creatures that are

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.799 
neighbor and the creatures that are
coming<00:00:48.239> through<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.390> gate<00:00:48.570> like<00:00:48.690> the

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
coming through the gate like the

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.389 
coming through the gate like the
creatures<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.230> we<00:00:49.350> saw<00:00:49.559> in<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.129> middle<00:00:50.309> of

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
creatures that we saw in the middle of

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.729 
creatures that we saw in the middle of
this<00:00:50.489> episode<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.210> like<00:00:52.020> I'm<00:00:52.289> guessing

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
this episode is like I'm guessing

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.470 
this episode is like I'm guessing
machines<00:00:53.370> or<00:00:53.640> something<00:00:53.940> made<00:00:54.149> by<00:00:54.420> the

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
machines or something made by the

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.060 
machines or something made by the
neighbors<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.140> seems<00:00:55.350> like<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.680> neighbors

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
neighbors it seems like the neighbors

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.369 
neighbors it seems like the neighbors
have<00:00:56.460> higher<00:00:56.730> tech<00:00:57.149> than<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.960> people<00:00:58.170> on

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
have higher tech than the people on

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.750 
have higher tech than the people on
earth<00:00:58.680> that's<00:00:58.920> exactly<00:00:59.250> what<00:00:59.370> I'm<00:00:59.460> getting

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
earth that's exactly what I'm getting

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.389 
earth that's exactly what I'm getting
from<00:00:59.910> this<00:01:00.120> episode<00:01:00.629> because<00:01:01.289> from<00:01:02.010> what<00:01:02.190> I

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
from this episode because from what I

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.709 
from this episode because from what I
saw<00:01:02.609> from<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.850> conversations<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.600> this

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
saw from the conversations in this

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.719 
saw from the conversations in this
episode<00:01:04.170> neighbors<00:01:05.040> are<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.309> ones<00:01:05.519> that

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
episode neighbors are the ones that

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.850 
episode neighbors are the ones that
invented<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.479> trigger<00:01:06.780> like<00:01:07.049> trigger<00:01:07.380> on<00:01:07.619> and

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
invented the trigger like trigger on and

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.429 
invented the trigger like trigger on and
stuff<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.070> know<00:01:08.159> activating<00:01:08.549> trigger<00:01:08.790> and

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
stuff you know activating trigger and

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.440 
stuff you know activating trigger and
border<00:01:10.439> took<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.130> technology<00:01:11.369> from<00:01:12.180> the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
border took that technology from the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.550 
border took that technology from the
neighbors<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.020> here's<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.409> big<00:01:13.530> question

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
neighbors so here's the big question

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.679 
neighbors so here's the big question
that<00:01:13.890> pops<00:01:14.220> up<00:01:14.369> with<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:14.700> episode<00:01:15.000> for

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
that pops up with this episode for

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.560 
that pops up with this episode for
border<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.770> have<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.159> technology<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:18.030> have

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
border to have that technology to have

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.660 
border to have that technology to have
trigger<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.680> would<00:01:19.830> mean<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.040> they<00:01:20.460> would

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
trigger that would mean that they would

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.940 
trigger that would mean that they would
have<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.030> know<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.540> neighbors<00:01:22.110> are<00:01:22.320> humans

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
have to know that neighbors are humans

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.730 
have to know that neighbors are humans
and<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.250> would<00:01:23.850> also<00:01:24.090> go<00:01:24.869> into<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.439> they

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
and that would also go into that they

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.380 
and that would also go into that they
might<00:01:25.920> have<00:01:26.130> some<00:01:26.430> form<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.909> neighbors

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
might have some form of neighbors

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.929 
might have some form of neighbors
capture<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:29.009> facility<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.850> know

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
capture and the facility of you know

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.760 
capture and the facility of you know
border<00:01:30.270> not<00:01:30.390> big<00:01:30.630> fortress<00:01:31.079> they<00:01:31.409> might<00:01:31.560> have

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
border not big fortress they might have

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.069 
border not big fortress they might have
some<00:01:32.040> form<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.369> human<00:01:32.759> neighbors<00:01:32.970> well<00:01:33.780> the

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
some form of human neighbors well the

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.219 
some form of human neighbors well the
big<00:01:34.229> thing<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.610> know<00:01:35.640> Kouga<00:01:36.299> human

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
big thing is is you know Kouga human

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.380 
big thing is is you know Kouga human
technically<00:01:37.740> he's<00:01:37.950> human<00:01:38.280> as<00:01:38.430> he<00:01:38.579> said<00:01:38.880> but

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
technically he's human as he said but

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.760 
technically he's human as he said but
he's<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.540> neighbor<00:01:39.869> from<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.170> different<00:01:40.380> world

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
the first episode it was not the best of

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.270 
the first episode it was not the best of
course<00:03:17.260> this<00:03:17.380> episode<00:03:17.769> wasn't<00:03:17.920> but<00:03:18.100> it<00:03:18.160> was<00:03:18.250> a

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
course this episode wasn't but it was a

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.710 
course this episode wasn't but it was a

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.120 
lot better I think than the first
episode<00:03:20.140> which<00:03:20.320> is<00:03:20.350> kind<00:03:20.650> of<00:03:20.709> weird<00:03:20.920> because

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
episode which is kind of weird because

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.069
