00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.660
 Hi there, this is my second video lesson 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:18.570
 Today I will talk about how exactly 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:21.150
 write a guitar there are such cases 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.680
 when you came up with Rome you need 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.540
 Do you write the grant writing both 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.950
 There is no song about the pro you have 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.290
 tablature some kind of ready 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.750
 Here you have invented the Reich and you 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:34.339
 need means he write put on his 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:39.239
 on him drums and so on 

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:41.249
 accordingly the music starts if you 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.890
 guitar player most often for water guitar 

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:45.809
 so you're still at the time of creation 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.659
 the compositions still have no idea how 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.460
 drums and drums will sound 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:55.800
 killed will be written already directly 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.929
 directly under the guitar reef itself so 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.120
 here to write even 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:02.329
 guitar first you need to write it yourself reef 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.290
 need to write under the metronome 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.049
 suppose we have what tariff 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.290
 which you come up with let him be here 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.290
 so 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.640
 and so we will need to write it under 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:28.430
 subway well I will set approximately 125 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:36.550
 beats per minute and so we put the metronome 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:36.550
 select a track with a guitar and start recording 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.270
 so we recorded the case there that under 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.819
 metronome to write more difficult due to the fact that 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.520
 there are only 4 hits and can be 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:06.350
 small out of sync with the rhythm 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.979
 for example if your party sounds 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.849
 trioli 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.629
 8 and 16 notes you can not get somewhere 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.510
 accordingly this can help you 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:16.370
 drums now let's write the part 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.420
 percussion which will be suitable for 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.420
 of our rhythm 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.880
 so our party is ready I wrote it 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:16.150
 about so simple 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.150
 let's listen 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:36.420
 There are some moments where I did not get 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.830
 when recorded under the metronome but for 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.080
 to fix it now we will 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:43.500
 written directly under the blow 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:48.330
 something will greatly facilitate our task 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:51.200
 guitar recordings delete this track and record 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.200
 new guitar 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:32.099
 and so now also write the second 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:37.800
 guitar part 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:37.800
 disabling a previously recorded new piece 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:06:04.460
 and after recording let's dissolve them by 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:07.000
 different in different channels and hear what 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.000
 we got out 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:26.770
 but somehow I hope the lesson was helpful 

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:29.979
 if something to record use 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:35.380
 the next stack of plugins is a fact filter 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:38.860
 about gt800 8 l e 456 and guitar rig for 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:40.949
 cabinet thanks all the best to 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.949
