00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.430 
on on trend I liked the textured linens
on<00:02:44.920> some<00:02:45.190> of<00:02:45.310> your<00:02:45.519> classic<00:02:46.030> pieces<00:02:46.440> the

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
on some of your classic pieces the

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.039 
on some of your classic pieces the
oriental<00:02:48.370> theme<00:02:48.700> I<00:02:49.000> think<00:02:49.390> is<00:02:49.570> something<00:02:49.810> that

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
oriental theme I think is something that

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:54.000 
oriental theme I think is something that
we're<00:02:50.290> seeing<00:02:50.590> as<00:02:51.400> well<00:02:51.700> in<00:02:52.420> the<00:02:52.540> market<00:02:53.019> yes<00:02:53.769> I

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
we're seeing as well in the market yes I

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.080 
we're seeing as well in the market yes I
think<00:02:54.070> people<00:02:54.310> are<00:02:54.489> getting<00:02:54.790> a<00:02:54.940> lot<00:02:55.030> more

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
think people are getting a lot more

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.780 
think people are getting a lot more
interested<00:02:55.750> in<00:02:56.010> actually<00:02:57.010> making<00:02:57.340> things

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
interested in actually making things

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.520 
interested in actually making things
again<00:02:58.120> so<00:02:58.330> I<00:02:58.360> think<00:02:58.480> that<00:02:58.690> that's<00:02:58.989> going<00:02:59.320> to<00:02:59.440> be

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
again so I think that that's going to be

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.470 
again so I think that that's going to be
great<00:02:59.799> for<00:03:00.130> particularly<00:03:00.760> for<00:03:00.940> fabrics

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
great for particularly for fabrics

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.050 
great for particularly for fabrics
obviously<00:03:01.989> I<00:03:02.380> think<00:03:02.890> this<00:03:03.010> is<00:03:03.190> absolutely

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
obviously I think this is absolutely

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.940 
obviously I think this is absolutely
wonderful<00:03:04.330> usually<00:03:05.200> when<00:03:05.350> you<00:03:05.470> buy<00:03:05.620> something
