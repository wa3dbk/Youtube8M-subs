00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
factory over there probably just one

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.670 
lifting so he's gonna get maybe a

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.930 
lifting so he's gonna get maybe a
dropship<00:04:59.150> there's<00:05:00.050> luxuries<00:05:01.010> zerglings

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940
