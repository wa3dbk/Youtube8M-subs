00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.245
 Hi, my name is Darek Kraśnicki 

00:00:07.245 --> 00:00:11.331
 and welcome to www.badania-na-prawo-jazdy-wroclaw.com 

00:00:12.353 --> 00:00:15.000
 In this video I will discuss another interesting topic 

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.666
 what is the obligation to put on seat belts 

00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:23.917
 the obligation to ride in seat belts while driving 

00:00:25.217 --> 00:00:26.703
 vehicle. 

00:00:27.214 --> 00:00:32.044
 However, there are a few exceptions here. 

00:00:35.573 --> 00:00:40.031
 This matter is regulated by art. 39 par. 1 

00:00:40.403 --> 00:00:43.839
 Road code. 

00:00:44.443 --> 00:00:47.415
 At least it regulates it in 2010, 

00:00:47.972 --> 00:00:52.106
 because as we all know, a new law is about to come 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.025
 about driving vehicles, also this legal basis which I mentioned may already be 

00:00:59.815 --> 00:01:01.301
 date. 

00:01:01.301 --> 00:01:07.384
 I will quote here art. 39 par. 1: "Driving a car vehicle 

00:01:07.384 --> 00:01:09.613
 and a person transported by such a vehicle 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.353
 equipped with seat belts 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:23.720
 they are required to use these belts while driving ", but subject to paragraph 3. 

00:01:27.446 --> 00:01:30.651
 I will not discuss the third paragraph because it applies here 

00:01:32.787 --> 00:01:35.388
 transporting children up to 12 years old and 

00:01:36.363 --> 00:01:39.289
 not exceeding 150cm tall. 

00:01:39.846 --> 00:01:42.720
 It's about a protective car seat. 

00:01:43.468 --> 00:01:49.640
 However, other more interesting exceptions are listed here 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.800
 in paragraph 2 art. 39. 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.630
 And I will list them here in order, paragraph 2 says: 

00:01:59.629 --> 00:02:02.740
 "The obligation to use seat belts does not apply to: 

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:06.920
 Well, the most interesting to me as a doctor 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.380
 a transport medicine specialist authorized to test drivers 

00:02:12.122 --> 00:02:18.300
 this is point 1 "not applicable to a person having a medical certificate on contraindication to the use of belts". 

00:02:19.088 --> 00:02:21.640
 There are also mentioned women with visible pregnancy, 

00:02:21.642 --> 00:02:25.540
 driving a taxi while carrying a passenger, 

00:02:25.868 --> 00:02:30.280
 instructor or examiner during his duties. 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.970
 No less important a policeman, an ABW officer and so on, and so on, right. 

00:02:39.985 --> 00:02:45.230
 I still remember the times from the beginning of my automotive career 

00:02:45.233 --> 00:02:50.480
 80s, when no one in any seatbelts traveled. 

00:02:51.781 --> 00:02:55.030
 Well, they were factory-mounted in cars 

00:02:55.032 --> 00:03:00.650
 but they were so awkward to use, some maladjusted, that 

00:03:00.976 --> 00:03:05.200
 the only exception was the one who rode his belts 

00:03:05.202 --> 00:03:12.960
 the one who "respected", so to speak, his own safety and did not ride in the lanes. 

00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:22.430
 I get a lot of inquiries from different people, on what basis 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:31.950
 we are to apply for such a ruling on contraindicated driving in seat belts. 

00:03:34.367 --> 00:03:39.570
 A lot here depends on the assessment of a particular doctor and assessment 

00:03:40.636 --> 00:03:44.160
 his diseases, diseases are so diverse that 

00:03:44.723 --> 00:03:49.180
 basically, it's difficult on the Internet, by phone or some other way 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:56.940
 assess whether a person is eligible for these seat belts or not. 

00:03:57.447 --> 00:04:01.580
 However, what can I say that in my office of transport medicine 

00:04:02.045 --> 00:04:05.480
 as a doctor authorized to test drivers 

00:04:06.642 --> 00:04:10.360
 so to speak, I have the authority to issue such judgments. 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:19.180
 To be clear, I'm not convinced 

00:04:19.367 --> 00:04:25.170
 to not use seat belts on so-called route. 

00:04:26.658 --> 00:04:33.860
 I advise against advancing to people who actually qualify 

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:36.040
 to release from seat belts. 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:39.520
 Well, a slightly different situation is 

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:43.840
 in a city where we sometimes cover short routes 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:52.010
 basically from street to street, sometimes they turn to me with such requests 

00:04:52.386 --> 00:04:55.680
 people running a business, shops. 

00:04:56.147 --> 00:05:02.930
 He must go around a small town, five streets to cross, and these belts are required 

00:05:02.928 --> 00:05:07.850
 plus the fact that the person has some health contraindications. 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:12.260
 Also here sooner 

00:05:13.051 --> 00:05:17.930
 a comprehensive assessment of the situation prompts me to issue such a ruling, 

00:05:17.928 --> 00:05:21.640
 than someone just because he does not want to ride. 

00:05:23.361 --> 00:05:27.630
 If, after all, despite such discouraging words 

00:05:29.677 --> 00:05:32.840
 you think you qualify for this 

00:05:33.113 --> 00:05:36.640
 exemption from driving in seat belts 

00:05:36.875 --> 00:05:39.240
 from the obligation to use seat belts, 

00:05:39.244 --> 00:05:45.280
 unfortunately, you have to go to Wrocław on Żernicka 215 street 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.830
 to my clinic of occupational medicine and medicine of transport. 

00:05:49.832 --> 00:05:54.620
 Here I show the address of this clinic. 

00:05:54.615 --> 00:06:04.090
 And unfortunately, only after a direct examination I can make a decision. 

00:06:05.203 --> 00:06:10.130
 I issue judgments, no certificates or other documents, 

00:06:10.126 --> 00:06:15.650
 which are honored by the Police or other traffic control authorities. 

00:06:16.442 --> 00:06:17.970
 Thank you very much!
