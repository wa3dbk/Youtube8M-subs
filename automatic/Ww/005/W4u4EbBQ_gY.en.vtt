put this together i'll take you through
step-by-step<00:00:21.100> on<00:00:21.609> how<00:00:21.699> to<00:00:21.939> build<00:00:22.090> this<00:00:22.240> model

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
step-by-step on how to build this model

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.339 
step-by-step on how to build this model
firstly<00:00:24.130> we'll<00:00:24.369> start<00:00:24.640> with<00:00:24.730> the<00:00:24.820> fuselage

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:25.349 
firstly we'll start with the fuselage

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:27.420 
firstly we'll start with the fuselage
underneath<00:00:26.349> you'll<00:00:26.740> see<00:00:26.890> a<00:00:26.920> slot<00:00:27.160> on<00:00:27.189> the<00:00:27.310> back

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
underneath you'll see a slot on the back

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.550 
underneath you'll see a slot on the back
here<00:00:27.730> this<00:00:28.359> simply<00:00:28.660> takes<00:00:28.869> the<00:00:29.080> rear

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
here this simply takes the rear

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.290 
here this simply takes the rear
undercarriage<00:00:30.039> and<00:00:30.220> that's<00:00:30.340> just<00:00:30.550> a<00:00:30.699> spring

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
undercarriage and that's just a spring

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.130 
undercarriage and that's just a spring
fit<00:00:31.480> or<00:00:31.599> a<00:00:31.630> press<00:00:31.869> fit<00:00:32.080> so<00:00:32.890> just<00:00:33.100> click<00:00:33.280> them<00:00:33.460> in

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
fit or a press fit so just click them in

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.540 
fit or a press fit so just click them in
is<00:00:35.140> is<00:00:35.469> that<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.910> front<00:00:37.180> wheel<00:00:38.280> down<00:00:39.280> there's

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
is is that the front wheel down there's

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.069 
is is that the front wheel down there's
a<00:00:39.610> bolt<00:00:39.850> on<00:00:39.969> them<00:00:40.120> so<00:00:40.450> this<00:00:40.600> will<00:00:40.690> go<00:00:40.809> in<00:00:40.930> that

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
a bolt on them so this will go in that

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.090 
a bolt on them so this will go in that
way<00:00:42.899> with<00:00:43.899> the<00:00:44.079> obviously<00:00:44.649> following<00:00:44.950> the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
way with the obviously following the

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.549

with these little clear pieces of tape

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.920 
with these little clear pieces of tape
so<00:04:51.440> you<00:04:51.530> would<00:04:51.680> just<00:04:51.770> put<00:04:51.919> a<00:04:51.950> piece<00:04:52.100> of<00:04:52.130> tape

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
so you would just put a piece of tape

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.360 
so you would just put a piece of tape
over<00:04:53.930> there<00:04:54.139> to<00:04:54.229> retain<00:04:54.530> them<00:04:54.680> to<00:04:55.040> plug<00:04:55.250> the

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
over there to retain them to plug the

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.490 
over there to retain them to plug the
wing<00:04:55.490> in<00:04:55.660> you'll<00:04:56.660> see<00:04:56.780> there's<00:04:56.990> a<00:04:57.080> channel<00:04:57.350> at

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
wing in you'll see there's a channel at

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.780 
wing in you'll see there's a channel at
the<00:04:57.560> front<00:04:57.740> of<00:04:57.800> the<00:04:57.889> fuselage<00:04:58.220> and<00:04:58.460> a<00:04:58.550> channel

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
the front of the fuselage and a channel

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.390 
the front of the fuselage and a channel
on<00:04:59.090> the<00:04:59.360> wing<00:04:59.570> so<00:05:00.290> that'll<00:05:00.560> tongue<00:05:01.130> and<00:05:01.280> groove

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
on the wing so that'll tongue and groove

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.460 
on the wing so that'll tongue and groove
that'll<00:05:01.639> fit<00:05:01.790> into<00:05:01.910> there<00:05:02.180> and<00:05:02.389> before<00:05:03.320> doing

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
that'll fit into there and before doing

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:04.960 
that'll fit into there and before doing
so<00:05:03.740> we'll<00:05:04.130> plug<00:05:04.280> the<00:05:04.400> wires<00:05:04.580> together<00:05:04.850> now

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
so we'll plug the wires together now

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.000 
so we'll plug the wires together now
these<00:05:05.150> only<00:05:05.330> go<00:05:05.419> in<00:05:05.630> one<00:05:05.660> way

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
these only go in one way

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:14.630 
these only go in one way
we've<00:05:07.010> got<00:05:07.160> jst<00:05:07.639> connectors<00:05:08.350> left<00:05:09.350> motors

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.080 

that<00:05:15.640> one<00:05:17.340> and<00:05:18.340> then<00:05:18.430> we<00:05:18.520> just<00:05:18.640> flip<00:05:18.820> the<00:05:18.940> wing

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
that one and then we just flip the wing

underneath<00:05:27.970> that<00:05:28.090> carbon<00:05:28.540> fiber<00:05:28.720> wing

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 
underneath that carbon fiber wing

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.290 
underneath that carbon fiber wing
retainer<00:05:29.890> and<00:05:30.310> then<00:05:30.580> just<00:05:30.760> slide<00:05:30.970> it<00:05:31.090> sideways
