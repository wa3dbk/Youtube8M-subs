00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:24.810 
wish they I did the real scene and I'm
not<00:05:22.090> the<00:05:22.270> animation<00:05:22.900> scene<00:05:23.260> which<00:05:23.979> is<00:05:24.010> a<00:05:24.190> bit

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
not the animation scene which is a bit

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.120 
not the animation scene which is a bit
disappointing<00:05:25.169> but<00:05:26.169> that's<00:05:26.410> the<00:05:26.860> only<00:05:26.979> thing

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
disappointing but that's the only thing

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.460 
disappointing but that's the only thing
I<00:05:27.340> don't<00:05:27.490> like<00:05:27.639> about<00:05:27.760> this<00:05:28.120> story<00:05:28.389> it's<00:05:29.380> just

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
I don't like about this story it's just

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.480 
I don't like about this story it's just
because<00:05:29.919> they<00:05:30.039> use<00:05:30.190> the<00:05:30.340> animation<00:05:30.970> of<00:05:31.060> that<00:05:31.120> I

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
because they use the animation of that I

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.980 
because they use the animation of that I
Fitness<00:05:33.490> should<00:05:33.639> I<00:05:33.699> use<00:05:33.910> the<00:05:34.120> real<00:05:34.360> version

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
Fitness should I use the real version

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.920 
Fitness should I use the real version
not<00:05:35.620> the<00:05:35.650> animation<00:05:36.400> but<00:05:36.610> overall<00:05:37.389> it's<00:05:37.810> still

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
not the animation but overall it's still

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.189 
not the animation but overall it's still
a<00:05:38.199> fantastic<00:05:38.650> story<00:05:39.550> it's<00:05:40.240> something<00:05:40.630> really

episode four has been found and which is
good<00:05:52.950> but<00:05:53.750> also<00:05:54.750> I'm<00:05:54.900> very<00:05:55.220> important<00:05:56.220> because

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540 
good but also I'm very important because

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.120 
good but also I'm very important because
if<00:05:57.540> they've<00:05:57.780> already<00:05:57.990> found<00:05:58.440> it<00:05:58.770> then

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.130 
if they've already found it then

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.210 
if they've already found it then
Episode<00:06:02.130> four<00:06:02.160> is<00:06:03.590> this<00:06:04.590> is<00:06:04.740> the<00:06:04.890> animation

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 
Episode four is this is the animation

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.860 
Episode four is this is the animation
and<00:06:05.550> apparently<00:06:06.210> they're<00:06:06.420> going<00:06:06.540> to<00:06:06.690> be<00:06:06.750> doing

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
and apparently they're going to be doing

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.960 
and apparently they're going to be doing
a<00:06:07.080> tenth<00:06:07.410> planet<00:06:07.860> national<00:06:08.430> edition<00:06:08.730> which<00:06:08.850> I

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:08.970 
a tenth planet national edition which I

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.940 
a tenth planet national edition which I
hope<00:06:09.180> is<00:06:09.300> not<00:06:09.330> true<00:06:09.750> because<00:06:10.530> I<00:06:10.620> won't<00:06:10.830> be

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:10.950 
hope is not true because I won't be

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:14.930 
hope is not true because I won't be
getting<00:06:11.340> that<00:06:11.490> again<00:06:12.080> so<00:06:13.080> in<00:06:13.770> a<00:06:13.980> way<00:06:14.190> the<00:06:14.640> fact

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:14.940 
getting that again so in a way the fact

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.770 
getting that again so in a way the fact
that<00:06:15.030> if<00:06:15.480> episode<00:06:15.990> false<00:06:16.620> found<00:06:17.100> it<00:06:17.790> it's<00:06:18.270> fine

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.780 
that if episode false found it it's fine

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.350 
that if episode false found it it's fine
I'm<00:06:19.080> happy<00:06:19.590> about<00:06:19.800> it<00:06:20.100> but<00:06:20.250> in<00:06:20.460> another<00:06:21.090> way

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
I'm happy about it but in another way

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.480 
I'm happy about it but in another way
I'll<00:06:21.840> be<00:06:22.050> really<00:06:22.320> as<00:06:22.590> a<00:06:22.620> point<00:06:22.950> hit<00:06:23.220> and

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
I'll be really as a point hit and

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.300 
I'll be really as a point hit and
