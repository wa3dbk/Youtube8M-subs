00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500
 of aaac personal beauty cheer talking 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.740
 one more time this time I'll bring a 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.230
 mw3 gameplay is not news for 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.929
 you in the name that is not new either 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.000
 but this is what I'm going to say 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.539
 as you have already seen by the title on the 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.580
 biggest mistake of small car channels 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.470
 small in make many mistakes but 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.689
 normal in the beginning mainly on the 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.849
 edition and tetra but these things that you 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.279
 will catch up with the real time I 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.350
 example a bigger defect that I see 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.520
 for example beyond the bad image but it is 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.820
 one thing that does not have much like 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.469
 to improve but I speak very fast to 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.850
 Sometimes I'll try to improve this in 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.110
 next videos 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.450
 When I ask for your opinion on 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.950
 facebook for example is many speak 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.100
 about that my voice 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.160
 they are not my video is very bad but I 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.539
 I know there's no way that I could stay. 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.820
 head all the video but it is a cohesive group 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.000
 and what then, people do not have much like 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.699
 make the video look so good 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.890
 but of course with time listening to subscribers 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.920
 and I'm winning by following the actions 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.680
 Maybe I'll join the sea network. 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.270
 even small and this will be a 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.670
 incentive to buy a license plate 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.860
 big catch sells a band intended 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.780
 buy a car here buy the 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.600
 boxes of the capture teams, I will not 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.520
 buy a good board like hd 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.159
 This is not going to take long because I 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.920
 actually I am going to buy one do not know 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.210
 when I do not know yet if I really go 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.710
 keep doing this I'm enjoying it 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.960
 A lot of making videos interact with the 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.549
 staff who also play with gamers 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.680
 new but the following what prays and who of 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.990
 who makes videos for youtube in 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.890
 small channels I say is to make video 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:50.100
 great big 20 minute video who is 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.909
 who to watch video assiduously in the 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.350
 youtube 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.630
 There's no way around here, the little one. 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.310
 generally the staff and 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.890
 big people 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.590
 they have more saw the big people 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.030
 big and tubular monark psdb girl 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.829
 it was basketball 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.960
 they can make great videos because 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.090
 they have a trust already have a 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.410
 intimacy with the public 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.340
 already the small channels do not fall because 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.540
 that little one is emerging 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.780
 It's who's watching that little girl. 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.900
 usually enough video so see a 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.150
 40-minute video of 20 up to 10 times 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.370
 will not draw so much attention will give a 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.110
 little bit of laziness to see myself time 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.470
 sad to see some very large videos of 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.330
 small channels but videos of 4 and 5 up 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.140
 seven minutes talking see see on a good 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.790
 like this 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.040
 There are a lot of people who work a lot 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.470
 Only people who study for example 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.599
 study in two periods the study 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.549
 morning and afternoon listening I do 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.530
 high school technical education 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.599
 so I only have the night to record 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.329
 video and first I do not have time anymore 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.769
 to record and to see that they are much less 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.959
 so if you have a video of four 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.579
 minutes I see this problem one that is 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.209
 the biggest mistake for sure the houses 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:03:01.690
 small is to record big video diogrande 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.549
 It's good again, it's got big video that 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.819
 it was just a series for example 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:10.989
 is doing a series is doing a 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:13.060
 chat is interesting about 40 minutes 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.220
 There's video that just does not work. 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.049
 I will want for example dropping 10 40 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.060
 minutes of battlefield 3 is a super game 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.319
 monotonous you know I 'm not talking 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.209
 from battlefield for the love of god I 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.319
 I have battlefield too. I'll do it. 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.590
 video battlefield 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.180
 I love battlefield 3 only we noticed it 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.099
 cool for who is playing but for whom 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.440
 you see it did not play 40 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:33.489
 direct minutes of deise that you like 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.549
 carved 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.290
 this is what is ending already the video is a 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.970
 ice cream to be funny or nothing was 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.549
 a video just to pass this little 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.870
 message to pro people who are new I am 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.760
 better than a lot of channel but it has a lot 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.900
 Kingfisher channel that does not know and does not 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.130
 You know this folks do not have 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.840
 patience do what ? 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.430
 if you are accustomed to 0 of great 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.590
 We're continuing to do what's going on. 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.510
 to see that you have the gift of this but I 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.400
 I 'm sure there were actually 40 thousand 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:02.950
 for example now it will not give her anything 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:05.349
 is this guys is worth if you like the 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.760
 a jewel joins the channel 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.470
 I have 50 subscribers in less than one 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.500

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.269
 same 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.970
 I'm usually recording this video. 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:18.579
 There are 51 subscribers and a few thousand 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.769
 views on the channel have eight videos 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.659
 the first of which was pilot and the 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.219
 second more or less also 

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:25.960
 so if I'm not with a lot of 

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:27.639

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:42.759
 great big gamers because this to 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:46.030
 I'm sure it's going to be a dream. 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:48.400
 if it worked out it would be like living a dream 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.020
 but compensated with new youtube methods 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.550
 small if you are seeing this you 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.240
 probably too small 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:57.639
 It's you, we have a dream that we 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.110
 will do anything to achieve 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:01.030
 if you do not think so you do not 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.770
 will work guy is it guys 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.630
