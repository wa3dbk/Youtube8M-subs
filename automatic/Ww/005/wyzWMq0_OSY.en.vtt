you know freezers trying to keep them

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.880 
you know freezers trying to keep them
will<00:00:43.000> get<00:00:43.180> the<00:00:43.300> ball<00:00:43.450> back<00:00:43.690> out<00:00:43.899> and<00:00:44.530> there's

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
will get the ball back out and there's

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.440 
will get the ball back out and there's
three<00:00:45.160> or<00:00:45.309> four<00:00:45.460> hearts<00:00:45.730> players<00:00:46.000> trouble<00:00:46.360> and

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.450 
three or four hearts players trouble and

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.540 
three or four hearts players trouble and
over<00:00:46.629> and<00:00:46.719> so<00:00:46.840> Alan<00:00:47.170> you<00:00:47.920> know<00:00:48.010> just<00:00:48.190> goes<00:00:48.399> to

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
over and so Alan you know just goes to

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:49.920 
over and so Alan you know just goes to
get<00:00:48.700> them<00:00:48.850> off<00:00:48.969> them<00:00:49.149> and<00:00:49.239> then<00:00:49.420> Ryan

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
get them off them and then Ryan

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.479 
get them off them and then Ryan
Stephenson<00:00:50.440> comes<00:00:50.590> from<00:00:50.800> nowhere<00:00:50.980> and<00:00:51.190> and

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
Stephenson comes from nowhere and and

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.639 
Stephenson comes from nowhere and and
and<00:00:51.879> and<00:00:52.090> the<00:00:52.870> children<00:00:53.170> really<00:00:53.260> don't<00:00:53.500> do<00:00:53.620> a

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
and and the children really don't do a

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:56.729 
and and the children really don't do a
lot<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:55.120> I<00:00:55.270> think<00:00:55.300> it<00:00:55.719> probably<00:00:55.750> should<00:00:56.649> have

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
lot and I think it probably should have

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.479 
lot and I think it probably should have
been<00:00:56.860> two<00:00:56.980> yellow<00:00:57.250> cards<00:00:57.340> but<00:00:59.039> referee<00:01:00.039> she<00:01:00.190> is

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
been two yellow cards but referee she is

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.959 
been two yellow cards but referee she is
red<00:01:00.699> I've<00:01:01.469> asked<00:01:02.469> to<00:01:02.530> go<00:01:02.680> and<00:01:02.800> see<00:01:02.949> him<00:01:03.070> and<00:01:03.250> you
