tone<00:00:38.540> this<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:40.489> fast<00:00:41.719> I<00:00:42.719> guess<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.469> would

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
tone this is a fast I guess you would

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.470 
tone this is a fast I guess you would
say<00:00:43.620> drying<00:00:44.300> foundation<00:00:45.300> um<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:47.270> really<00:00:48.270> like

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
say drying foundation um I really like

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.810 
say drying foundation um I really like
this<00:00:48.660> because<00:00:48.960> it's<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.920> foundation<00:00:50.730> and

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
this because it's a foundation and

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.600 
this because it's a foundation and
concealer<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:51.510> one<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.160> it<00:00:53.160> doesn't<00:00:53.430> matter

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
concealer in one and it doesn't matter

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.459 
concealer in one and it doesn't matter
when<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.000> apply<00:00:54.300> your<00:00:54.420> concealer<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:55.110> can<00:00:55.289> do

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
when you apply your concealer you can do

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.279 
when you apply your concealer you can do
it<00:00:55.649> after<00:00:55.969> you<00:00:56.969> do<00:00:57.270> your<00:00:57.480> foundation<00:00:58.140> all<00:00:58.260> over

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
it after you do your foundation all over

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.310 
it after you do your foundation all over
or<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.800> can<00:00:58.949> do<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.129> before<00:00:59.809> the<00:01:00.809> only<00:01:00.989> thing<00:01:01.199> I

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
or you can do it before the only thing I

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.310 
or you can do it before the only thing I
dislike<00:01:01.710> about<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.820> when<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.870> apply<00:01:04.260> it

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
dislike about this is when you apply it

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.149 
dislike about this is when you apply it
I<00:01:05.060> personally<00:01:06.060> have<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.810> work<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.290> sections

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
I personally have to work in sections

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.700 
I personally have to work in sections
like<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.400> 30<00:01:08.549> min<00:01:08.700> cheek<00:01:08.970> first<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.750> then<00:01:10.350> kind

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
like a 30 min cheek first and then kind

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.320 
like a 30 min cheek first and then kind
of<00:01:10.830> work<00:01:11.010> around<00:01:11.159> in<00:01:11.460> sections<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:11.939> my<00:01:12.030> face

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
of work around in sections of my face

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.600 
of work around in sections of my face
because<00:01:12.630> if<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.140> find<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.979> tends<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.369> dry

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
because if I find that it tends to dry

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.539 
because if I find that it tends to dry
too<00:01:14.670> fast<00:01:15.210> for<00:01:15.509> me<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.720> blend<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.080> out<00:01:16.200> properly

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
too fast for me to blend it out properly

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.280 
too fast for me to blend it out properly
but<00:01:17.549> other<00:01:17.670> than<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.630> really<00:01:18.930> good

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
but other than that this is really good

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.880 
but other than that this is really good
I've<00:01:20.100> never<00:01:20.369> had<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.659> foundation<00:01:22.470> as<00:01:22.590> good<00:01:22.770> as

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
I've never had a foundation as good as

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.760 
I've never had a foundation as good as
this<00:01:23.040> one<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.600> highly<00:01:24.600> recommend<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:25.229> if<00:01:25.439> you

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
this one I highly recommend it if you

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.380 
this one I highly recommend it if you
have<00:01:27.350> colored<00:01:28.350> skin<00:01:28.770> with<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.579> know<00:01:29.790> olive

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
have colored skin with you know olive

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.850 
have colored skin with you know olive
skin<00:01:30.659> tones<00:01:30.930> which<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.470> what<00:01:31.619> they<00:01:31.770> kind<00:01:32.070> of

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
skin tones which is what they kind of

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.590 
skin tones which is what they kind of
market<00:01:34.860> towards<00:01:35.130> with<00:01:35.460> their<00:01:35.700> foundations

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
market towards with their foundations

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.569 
market towards with their foundations
and<00:01:36.930> that's<00:01:37.680> probably<00:01:37.890> what's<00:01:38.220> helped<00:01:38.400> me<00:01:38.549> out

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
and that's probably what's helped me out

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.969 
and that's probably what's helped me out
the<00:01:38.820> best<00:01:39.030> being<00:01:39.570> biracial<00:01:40.020> I've<00:01:40.590> never<00:01:40.770> been

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.280 
only downfall to this brush as I find
that<00:02:16.160> it<00:02:16.310> sheds<00:02:16.610> but<00:02:17.030> it<00:02:17.120> hasn't<00:02:17.450> shed<00:02:17.750> a<00:02:17.960> lot

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
that it sheds but it hasn't shed a lot

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.200 
that it sheds but it hasn't shed a lot
it's<00:02:18.560> only<00:02:18.860> a<00:02:18.890> few<00:02:19.220> hairs<00:02:19.550> every<00:02:19.940> time<00:02:20.090> I<00:02:20.180> use

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
it's only a few hairs every time I use

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.660 
it's only a few hairs every time I use
it<00:02:20.600> which<00:02:21.260> I<00:02:21.500> don't<00:02:21.710> find<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:22.040> be<00:02:22.070> a<00:02:22.160> big<00:02:22.430> deal

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
it which I don't find to be a big deal

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.790 
it which I don't find to be a big deal
but<00:02:23.060> some<00:02:23.300> of<00:02:23.420> you<00:02:23.630> who<00:02:24.020> don't<00:02:24.320> really<00:02:24.560> like

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
but some of you who don't really like

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.090 
but some of you who don't really like
that<00:02:25.040> might<00:02:25.340> find<00:02:25.580> it<00:02:25.640> a<00:02:25.700> big<00:02:25.850> deal<00:02:26.350> I<00:02:27.350> got<00:02:27.890> this

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
that might find it a big deal I got this

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.760 
that might find it a big deal I got this
at<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.460> mac<00:02:28.640> store<00:02:28.670> for<00:02:29.360> I<00:02:29.390> believe<00:02:29.510> was<00:02:29.930> $32

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
at the mac store for I believe was $32

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.280 
at the mac store for I believe was $32
so<00:02:31.580> I<00:02:31.610> will<00:02:31.910> definitely<00:02:32.120> take<00:02:32.570> very<00:02:33.020> good<00:02:33.230> care

so I will definitely take very good care
of<00:02:33.500> this<00:02:33.740> since<00:02:34.100> it<00:02:34.220> was<00:02:34.310> so<00:02:34.460> expensive<00:02:34.750> but

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750
