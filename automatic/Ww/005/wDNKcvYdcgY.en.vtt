00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.220 
growing sheet but it is bathtub and stay
off<00:03:00.460> so<00:03:00.610> you<00:03:00.700> can<00:03:00.880> see<00:03:01.120> that<00:03:01.330> it<00:03:01.780> comes<00:03:01.960> up<00:03:02.080> at

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
off so you can see that it comes up at

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.650 
off so you can see that it comes up at
the<00:03:02.320> edges<00:03:02.470> here<00:03:02.860> and<00:03:03.270> that's<00:03:04.270> going<00:03:04.330> to<00:03:04.450> stop

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
the edges here and that's going to stop

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.090 
the edges here and that's going to stop
any<00:03:04.870> sort<00:03:05.080> of<00:03:05.110> drafts<00:03:05.500> coming<00:03:05.560> in<00:03:05.860> through<00:03:06.040> the

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
any sort of drafts coming in through the

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.010 
any sort of drafts coming in through the
stage<00:03:06.400> they'll<00:03:07.030> keep<00:03:07.180> out<00:03:07.360> water<00:03:07.390> and

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
stage they'll keep out water and

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.900 
stage they'll keep out water and
hopefully<00:03:08.350> keep<00:03:08.680> up<00:03:08.830> those<00:03:08.980> unwanted<00:03:09.280> bugs<00:03:09.670> as

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
hopefully keep up those unwanted bugs as

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.480 
hopefully keep up those unwanted bugs as
well<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.750> material<00:03:11.230> itself<00:03:11.350> is<00:03:11.830> a<00:03:11.890> double

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
well the material itself is a double

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:13.830 
well the material itself is a double
quoted<00:03:12.670> polyethylene<00:03:13.420> so<00:03:13.540> it's<00:03:13.660> quite<00:03:13.780> a

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
quoted polyethylene so it's quite a

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.330 
quoted polyethylene so it's quite a
heavy<00:03:14.020> duty<00:03:14.260> material<00:03:14.830> and<00:03:15.070> it<00:03:15.160> has<00:03:15.310> a

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
heavy duty material and it has a

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.920 
heavy duty material and it has a
hydrostatic<00:03:15.730> head<00:03:16.030> of<00:03:16.390> ten<00:03:16.570> thousand

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
hydrostatic head of ten thousand

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.770 
hydrostatic head of ten thousand
millimeters<00:03:17.580> so<00:03:18.580> within<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:18.910> tent<00:03:19.120> you'll

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
millimeters so within the tent you'll

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.510 
millimeters so within the tent you'll
find<00:03:19.990> above<00:03:20.500> these<00:03:20.680> windows<00:03:20.980> here<00:03:21.160> that<00:03:21.400> we

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
find above these windows here that we

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.970 
find above these windows here that we

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
have these ventilation panels air which

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.500 
have these ventilation panels air which
correspond<00:03:24.490> to<00:03:24.550> the<00:03:24.700> outside<00:03:24.970> ventilation

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
correspond to the outside ventilation

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.750 
correspond to the outside ventilation
