think<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.799> he<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:14.760> good<00:01:15.030> speed<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.659> fact

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
think that he is good speed the fact

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.289 
think that he is good speed the fact
that<00:01:15.960> he's<00:01:16.140> pretty<00:01:16.799> good<00:01:17.100> in<00:01:17.280> coverage<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:18.119> why

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
that he's pretty good in coverage is why

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.609 
that he's pretty good in coverage is why
I<00:01:18.360> think<00:01:18.600> he<00:01:18.689> may<00:01:18.810> be<00:01:18.869> able<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.140> excel<00:01:19.439> as<00:01:19.560> a

know<00:01:21.960> whatever<00:01:22.229> system<00:01:22.560> he<00:01:22.770> gets<00:01:22.920> involved

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
know whatever system he gets involved

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.340 
know whatever system he gets involved
with<00:01:23.369> he's<00:01:23.640> great<00:01:24.060> pursuit<00:01:24.540> good<00:01:25.080> at<00:01:25.170> chasing

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350

with he's great pursuit good at chasing
down<00:01:25.560> run<00:01:25.860> plays<00:01:26.299> I<00:01:27.299> definitely<00:01:28.110> think<00:01:28.500> he

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
down run plays I definitely think he

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.940

does<00:01:28.920> need<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.220> develop<00:01:29.670> but<00:01:30.600> after<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.439> year<00:01:31.710> or

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
does need to develop but after a year or

does need to develop but after a year or
two<00:01:32.189> we<00:01:32.310> can<00:01:32.549> definitely<00:01:32.759> become<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.119> full-time

great he will be in coverage he's not a

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.960 
great he will be in coverage he's not a
liability<00:03:37.769> but<00:03:38.769> I<00:03:39.010> think<00:03:39.400> because<00:03:39.640> of<00:03:39.880> this

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.180 
liability but I think because of this
height<00:03:40.269> if<00:03:41.140> you<00:03:41.260> have<00:03:41.350> him<00:03:41.470> covering<00:03:41.920> deep

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
the Miami Dolphins lob was pretty much

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.470 
the Miami Dolphins lob was pretty much
slated<00:04:08.680> to<00:04:08.769> be<00:04:08.980> the<00:04:09.340> replacement<00:04:10.000> for<00:04:10.329> relay

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.329 
Ray Lewis there in Baltimore ultimate

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:14.759 
Ray Lewis there in Baltimore ultimate
did<00:04:13.510> not<00:04:13.630> work<00:04:13.780> out<00:04:13.930> he<00:04:14.109> took<00:04:14.290> the<00:04:14.410> paycheck

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
did not work out he took the paycheck

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:17.159 
did not work out he took the paycheck
and<00:04:14.859> went<00:04:15.010> to<00:04:15.070> Miami<00:04:15.450> but<00:04:16.450> I<00:04:16.510> basically<00:04:16.780> think

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
and went to Miami but I basically think

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.670 
and went to Miami but I basically think
that<00:04:17.560> much<00:04:18.310> like<00:04:18.729> Ellerbe<00:04:19.239> Shayne<00:04:20.109> Skov<00:04:20.140> will

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
that much like Ellerbe Shayne Skov will

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.250 
that much like Ellerbe Shayne Skov will
be<00:04:20.799> able<00:04:21.039> to<00:04:21.190> be<00:04:21.729> very<00:04:22.000> good<00:04:22.240> in<00:04:22.300> the<00:04:22.390> run<00:04:22.659> he

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
be able to be very good in the run he

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.600 
be able to be very good in the run he
can<00:04:23.380> also<00:04:23.590> get<00:04:23.830> off<00:04:23.919> the<00:04:24.010> quarterback<00:04:24.400> they

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
can also get off the quarterback they

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
can also get off the quarterback they
want<00:04:24.760> to<00:04:24.820> use<00:04:24.909> them<00:04:25.000> in<00:04:25.120> a<00:04:25.150> blitz

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
want to use them in a blitz

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.950 
want to use them in a blitz
uh<00:04:26.160> but<00:04:27.160> I<00:04:27.220> think<00:04:27.670> that<00:04:27.910> the<00:04:28.240> fact<00:04:28.450> that<00:04:28.570> he

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
uh but I think that the fact that he

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.030 
uh but I think that the fact that he
probably<00:04:29.170> is<00:04:29.380> a<00:04:29.410> little<00:04:29.590> bit<00:04:29.680> better<00:04:29.860> than

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
probably is a little bit better than

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.230 
probably is a little bit better than
Ellerbe<00:04:30.430> and<00:04:30.580> coverage<00:04:30.880> he's<00:04:31.000> just<00:04:31.150> an

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
Ellerbe and coverage he's just an

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.840 
Ellerbe and coverage he's just an
athletic<00:04:31.660> freak<00:04:31.930> uh<00:04:32.440> you<00:04:33.280> know<00:04:33.400> I<00:04:33.430> mean<00:04:33.670> I

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
athletic freak uh you know I mean I

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.730 
athletic freak uh you know I mean I
think<00:04:34.180> with<00:04:34.840> how<00:04:36.600> the<00:04:37.600> NFL<00:04:37.990> is<00:04:38.110> really<00:04:38.560> going

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
think with how the NFL is really going

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.350 
think with how the NFL is really going
with<00:04:38.980> you<00:04:39.130> need<00:04:39.310> your<00:04:39.430> linebackers<00:04:39.640> to<00:04:40.060> not

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
with you need your linebackers to not

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.910 
with you need your linebackers to not
before<00:04:40.870> as<00:04:40.990> always<00:04:41.260> you<00:04:41.590> always<00:04:41.620> had<00:04:41.890> your

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
before as always you always had your

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.740 
before as always you always had your
great<00:04:42.310> tackling<00:04:42.790> line<00:04:42.970> magus<00:04:43.300> now<00:04:43.450> you<00:04:43.510> need

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
great tackling line magus now you need

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.240 
great tackling line magus now you need
linebackers<00:04:44.260> I<00:04:44.350> can<00:04:44.500> not<00:04:44.620> only<00:04:44.710> tackle<00:04:45.100> very

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
linebackers I can not only tackle very

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.250 
linebackers I can not only tackle very

well be the effective in coverage I

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.660 
well be the effective in coverage I
think<00:04:47.710> scoffs<00:04:47.950> gonna<00:04:48.160> be<00:04:48.280> that's<00:04:48.400> what<00:04:48.580> to

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:48.670 
think scoffs gonna be that's what to

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.820 
think scoffs gonna be that's what to
help<00:04:48.940> him<00:04:49.150> elevate<00:04:49.930> him<00:04:50.050> over<00:04:50.380> the<00:04:50.470> guys<00:04:50.620> like

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
Shane Berlin who I pretty much almost

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.720

drafted the same grade with Scott being

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.760
