00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
was kind of at a crossroads in 2009 and

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.020 
was kind of at a crossroads in 2009 and
the<00:01:42.990> reason<00:01:43.320> being<00:01:43.460> was<00:01:44.460> they<00:01:44.670> came<00:01:44.850> out<00:01:44.880> with

a this was rated at about 700 lumens

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.240 
a this was rated at about 700 lumens
before<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:51.320> mid<00:01:52.320> year<00:01:52.590> they<00:01:52.800> came<00:01:52.980> out<00:01:53.040> with

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
something called the Tesla with one LED

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.060 
something called the Tesla with one LED
but<00:01:56.940> it<00:01:57.030> was<00:01:57.120> so<00:01:57.360> bright<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.870> it<00:01:58.560> was

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
but it was so bright that it was

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.649 
but it was so bright that it was
threatening<00:01:59.750> the<00:02:00.750> audience<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:02.659> the

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
threatening the audience of the of the

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.060 
threatening the audience of the of the
Wilma<00:02:03.960> they<00:02:04.170> were<00:02:04.290> just<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.500> little<00:02:04.620> too<00:02:04.740> close

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
Wilma they were just a little too close

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.749 
Wilma they were just a little too close
to<00:02:05.790> each<00:02:05.820> other<00:02:06.470> so<00:02:07.470> and<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.190> Tesla<00:02:08.580> was

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
to each other so and and the Tesla was

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.289 
to each other so and and the Tesla was
was<00:02:09.200> for<00:02:10.200> 450<00:02:11.159> you<00:02:11.489> know<00:02:11.609> quite<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.849> bit<00:02:11.909> cheaper

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:12.299 
was for 450 you know quite a bit cheaper

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.880 
was for 450 you know quite a bit cheaper
so<00:02:12.930> it<00:02:13.379> was<00:02:13.499> hard<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:13.799> justify

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
so it was hard to justify

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.590 
so it was hard to justify
you<00:02:16.520> know<00:02:16.610> what<00:02:16.880> what<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:19.520> market<00:02:19.880> for

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.350 
you know what what the the market for
the<00:02:20.720> work<00:02:20.870> for<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.319> for<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.310> Wilma<00:02:22.670> so<00:02:23.240> what

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.559 

it's<00:03:13.550> just<00:03:13.610> a<00:03:13.820> porch

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:19.559 

and<00:03:17.689> this<00:03:18.290> is<00:03:18.409> one<00:03:18.530> of<00:03:18.560> my<00:03:18.680> favorite<00:03:19.069> lights

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
and this is one of my favorite lights

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.440 
and this is one of my favorite lights
this<00:03:20.569> year<00:03:20.980> because<00:03:21.980> of<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.189> weight<00:03:22.450> because

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
this year because of the weight because

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.170 
this year because of the weight because
of<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:23.599> brightness<00:03:24.280> it's<00:03:25.280> just<00:03:25.549> so<00:03:25.819> bright

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
of the brightness it's just so bright

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.349 
of the brightness it's just so bright
that<00:03:27.370> you<00:03:28.370> could<00:03:28.519> really<00:03:28.670> go<00:03:28.849> high-speed<00:03:29.269> ooh

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
that you could really go high-speed ooh

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:34.959 
that you could really go high-speed ooh
this<00:03:29.680> surprisingly<00:03:31.150> we<00:03:32.150> have<00:03:32.359> a<00:03:33.700> light<00:03:34.700> called

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:34.969 
this surprisingly we have a light called

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:36.670 
this surprisingly we have a light called
a<00:03:35.090> berry<00:03:35.329> light<00:03:35.599> at<00:03:35.810> seventeen<00:03:36.349> hundred

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
a berry light at seventeen hundred

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.869 
a berry light at seventeen hundred
lumens<00:03:36.829> and<00:03:37.280> i<00:03:38.209> actually<00:03:38.569> prefer<00:03:39.170> this

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:39.879 
lumens and i actually prefer this

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:45.099 
lumens and i actually prefer this
because<00:03:40.879> for<00:03:41.359> the<00:03:42.139> width<00:03:42.409> of<00:03:42.620> the<00:03:43.579> light<00:03:44.109> this

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:45.109 
because for the width of the light this

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:48.220 
because for the width of the light this
is<00:03:45.230> this<00:03:45.919> is<00:03:46.150> just<00:03:47.150> enough<00:03:47.359> brightness<00:03:47.870> for<00:03:48.139> me

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
is this is just enough brightness for me

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.369 
is this is just enough brightness for me
the<00:03:49.040> betty<00:03:49.280> is<00:03:49.370> not<00:03:49.760> bright<00:03:50.689> enough<00:03:50.719> to<00:03:51.019> take

the betty is not bright enough to take

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:53.050 
the betty is not bright enough to take
advantage<00:03:51.620> not<00:03:52.189> wide<00:03:52.400> enough<00:03:52.430> to<00:03:52.760> take
