block<00:00:23.050> is<00:00:23.350> going<00:00:23.770> to<00:00:23.830> help<00:00:24.100> us<00:00:25.080> create<00:00:26.080> steel

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
block is going to help us create steel

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.870 
block is going to help us create steel
amongst<00:00:28.090> other<00:00:28.210> things<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:30.340> if<00:00:30.460> we<00:00:30.550> have<00:00:30.850> a

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
amongst other things so if we have a

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.110 
amongst other things so if we have a
look<00:00:31.090> at<00:00:31.450> the<00:00:31.810> block<00:00:32.050> itself<00:00:32.670> what<00:00:33.670> we've<00:00:33.850> got

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
look at the block itself what we've got

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.610 
look at the block itself what we've got
on<00:00:34.300> the<00:00:34.690> right<00:00:34.809> hand<00:00:34.989> side<00:00:35.280> we<00:00:36.280> have<00:00:36.309> our<00:00:37.180> power

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
on the right hand side we have our power

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.970 
on the right hand side we have our power
so<00:00:38.620> this<00:00:39.280> is<00:00:39.520> where<00:00:39.880> we<00:00:40.000> could<00:00:40.210> insert

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
so this is where we could insert

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.620 
so this is where we could insert
batteries<00:00:41.980> and<00:00:42.220> things<00:00:42.370> like<00:00:42.520> that<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:46.030> that

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:46.630 
batteries and things like that and that

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.260 
batteries and things like that and that
bar<00:00:46.840> will<00:00:47.020> fill<00:00:47.230> up<00:00:47.670> just<00:00:48.670> show<00:00:48.850> us<00:00:49.000> how<00:00:49.150> much

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.270 
bar will fill up just show us how much

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.990 
bar will fill up just show us how much
power<00:00:49.510> we've<00:00:49.750> got<00:00:50.130> this<00:00:51.130> here<00:00:51.399> is<00:00:51.550> the<00:00:51.579> Alps

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
power we've got this here is the Alps

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.410 
power we've got this here is the Alps
lot<00:00:53.340> we<00:00:54.340> have<00:00:55.440> an<00:00:56.440> input<00:00:56.860> visual<00:00:57.760> slow<00:00:58.090> here

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
lot we have an input visual slow here

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.130 
lot we have an input visual slow here
which<00:00:58.660> will<00:00:59.020> take<00:00:59.320> press<00:00:59.890> carbon<00:01:00.489> as<00:01:01.480> you<00:01:01.989> can

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
which will take press carbon as you can

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.799 
which will take press carbon as you can
see<00:01:02.290> there<00:01:02.620> I<00:01:03.239> think<00:01:04.239> it<00:01:04.360> will<00:01:04.420> take<00:01:04.479> other

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
see there I think it will take other

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.520 
see there I think it will take other
things<00:01:05.079> as<00:01:05.259> well<00:01:06.060> we<00:01:07.060> can<00:01:07.270> hit<00:01:07.719> this<00:01:07.899> dump<00:01:08.290> bar

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
things as well we can hit this dump bar

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.670 
things as well we can hit this dump bar
and<00:01:08.799> I<00:01:08.890> will<00:01:09.009> empty<00:01:09.250> out<00:01:10.080> whatever<00:01:11.080> is<00:01:11.380> there

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
and I will empty out whatever is there

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.740 
and I will empty out whatever is there
it<00:01:12.460> will<00:01:12.640> also<00:01:12.790> empty<00:01:13.330> out<00:01:15.150> don't<00:01:16.150> run<00:01:16.570> into

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
it will also empty out don't run into

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.560 
it will also empty out don't run into
that<00:01:16.990> out<00:01:17.820> we<00:01:18.820> can<00:01:19.090> have<00:01:19.240> a<00:01:19.270> look<00:01:19.390> at<00:01:19.510> the

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
that out we can have a look at the

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.160 
that out we can have a look at the
recipes<00:01:19.930> quickly<00:01:20.440> and<00:01:21.430> that<00:01:22.390> will<00:01:22.600> give<00:01:22.750> us<00:01:22.930> an

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
recipes quickly and that will give us an

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.200 
recipes quickly and that will give us an
idea<00:01:23.260> of<00:01:23.530> what<00:01:23.770> we<00:01:23.890> can<00:01:23.979> put<00:01:24.190> in<00:01:24.310> there<00:01:24.520> so<00:01:25.119> you

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
idea of what we can put in there so you

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.960 
idea of what we can put in there so you
can<00:01:25.570> use<00:01:26.049> tin<00:01:26.350> dusts<00:01:26.799> in<00:01:27.010> there<00:01:27.460> with<00:01:27.760> your

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
can use tin dusts in there with your

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.280 
can use tin dusts in there with your
copper<00:01:28.299> ingots<00:01:28.690> and<00:01:28.810> that's<00:01:29.020> going<00:01:29.140> to<00:01:29.200> give

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
copper ingots and that's going to give

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.090 
copper ingots and that's going to give
you<00:01:29.500> bronze<00:01:30.930> it's<00:01:31.930> quite<00:01:32.380> good<00:01:32.590> we're<00:01:32.830> getting

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
you bronze it's quite good we're getting

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.390 
you bronze it's quite good we're getting
bronze<00:01:33.880> I<00:01:34.119> think<00:01:34.450> I<00:01:34.780> seem<00:01:35.409> to<00:01:35.590> recall<00:01:35.710> that<00:01:36.010> you

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
bronze I think I seem to recall that you

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.080 
bronze I think I seem to recall that you
need<00:01:36.610> a<00:01:36.640> lot<00:01:36.970> less<00:01:37.210> tin<00:01:37.659> for<00:01:38.350> your<00:01:38.470> copper<00:01:39.090> then

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
need a lot less tin for your copper then

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:48.420 
need a lot less tin for your copper then
you<00:01:40.270> would<00:01:40.479> any<00:01:40.689> other<00:01:40.780> way<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:46.920> say<00:01:47.920> my<00:01:47.950> speed

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
you would any other way you say my speed

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.100 
you would any other way you say my speed
different<00:01:49.030> coppers<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.939> this<00:01:52.570> is<00:01:52.810> the<00:01:52.930> one

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
different coppers and this is the one

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.440 
different coppers and this is the one
which<00:01:53.290> we're<00:01:53.560> most<00:01:53.799> interested<00:01:54.460> in<00:01:54.580> or<00:01:55.030> we

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
which we're most interested in or we

will be most interested in early on is

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.940 
will be most interested in early on is
you<00:01:59.530> compressed<00:02:00.430> carbon<00:02:00.700> which<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:02.530> easy<00:02:02.740> way

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
you compressed carbon which the easy way

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.260 
you compressed carbon which the easy way
to<00:02:03.009> get<00:02:03.220> that<00:02:03.369> is<00:02:03.610> to<00:02:04.320> smell<00:02:05.320> Cole<00:02:06.150> give<00:02:07.150> you

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
to get that is to smell Cole give you

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.699 
to get that is to smell Cole give you
your<00:02:07.479> compressed<00:02:07.869> carbon<00:02:08.049> there<00:02:08.349> is<00:02:08.470> another

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
your compressed carbon there is another

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.929 
your compressed carbon there is another
way<00:02:08.920> but<00:02:08.979> I<00:02:09.459> will<00:02:09.670> go<00:02:09.849> on<00:02:10.030> to<00:02:10.179> the<00:02:10.329> other<00:02:10.360> way

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:11.939 
way but I will go on to the other way

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:14.550 
way but I will go on to the other way
sadly<00:02:12.939> in<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.150> enrichment<00:02:13.480> chamber<00:02:13.750> which<00:02:14.380> is

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
sadly in the enrichment chamber which is

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
sadly in the enrichment chamber which is
one<00:02:14.709> of<00:02:14.739> the<00:02:14.890> blocks<00:02:15.099> we're<00:02:15.310> going<00:02:15.430> to<00:02:15.489> be

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
one of the blocks we're going to be

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.250 
one of the blocks we're going to be
looking<00:02:15.670> at

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
looking at

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.940 
looking at
next<00:02:17.260> some<00:02:17.969> it's<00:02:18.969> the<00:02:19.239> equivalent<00:02:19.510> of

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
next some it's the equivalent of

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.149 
next some it's the equivalent of
macerator<00:02:20.950> or<00:02:21.519> the<00:02:21.760> pulverizer<00:02:22.859> so<00:02:23.859> quite

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 
macerator or the pulverizer so quite

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:25.619 
macerator or the pulverizer so quite
useful<00:02:24.579> block<00:02:24.790> that<00:02:24.939> we're<00:02:25.090> going<00:02:25.239> to<00:02:25.329> wanna

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
useful block that we're going to wanna

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.410 
useful block that we're going to wanna
get<00:02:25.870> early<00:02:26.140> on<00:02:26.319> but<00:02:26.590> we<00:02:27.489> will<00:02:27.700> need<00:02:27.819> to<00:02:27.879> use<00:02:28.030> it

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
get early on but we will need to use it

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.229 
get early on but we will need to use it
first<00:02:31.290> so<00:02:32.290> one<00:02:32.500> other<00:02:32.650> recipes<00:02:33.099> if<00:02:33.250> we<00:02:33.340> go<00:02:33.489> so

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:53.889 
and our steel so if we have a look at

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:56.759 
and our steel so if we have a look at
the<00:02:53.950> recipe<00:02:54.129> for<00:02:54.430> this<00:02:54.780> we<00:02:55.780> have<00:02:55.810> platinum

ingots around an enriched alloy to give

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.470 
ingots around an enriched alloy to give
us<00:02:59.889> a<00:03:00.010> control<00:03:00.430> circuit<00:03:00.700> now<00:03:01.120> we're<00:03:01.239> going<00:03:01.389> to

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
us a control circuit now we're going to

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.159 
us a control circuit now we're going to
need<00:03:01.599> to<00:03:01.900> control<00:03:02.379> circuits<00:03:03.780> either<00:03:04.780> side<00:03:05.139> of

block there to provide some power just

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.460 
block there to provide some power just
so<00:03:40.329> that<00:03:40.479> I<00:03:40.540> don't<00:03:40.599> have<00:03:40.750> to<00:03:40.870> miss<00:03:41.019> around<00:03:41.319> too

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
so that I don't have to miss around too

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.539 
so that I don't have to miss around too
much<00:03:41.620> I<00:03:42.479> could<00:03:43.479> also<00:03:43.650> grab<00:03:44.650> a<00:03:44.709> battery<00:03:45.310> and

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
much I could also grab a battery and

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.629 
much I could also grab a battery and
then<00:03:45.729> this<00:03:46.620> there's<00:03:47.620> an<00:03:47.769> infinite<00:03:48.040> battery

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
then this there's an infinite battery

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:53.129 
then this there's an infinite battery
they've<00:03:49.919> kindly<00:03:50.919> provided<00:03:51.549> that<00:03:52.479> we<00:03:52.509> could

they've kindly provided that we could

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:55.409 
they've kindly provided that we could
put<00:03:53.290> in<00:03:53.409> a<00:03:53.560> slow<00:03:53.859> there<00:03:54.159> in<00:03:54.909> which<00:03:55.030> case<00:03:55.269> I

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:55.419 
put in a slow there in which case I

00:03:55.419 --> 00:04:00.790 
put in a slow there in which case I
wouldn't<00:03:55.599> need<00:03:55.810> this<00:03:55.989> at<00:03:56.169> all

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.640 

that<00:04:01.800> will<00:04:01.950> keep<00:04:02.070> that<00:04:02.130> full<00:04:02.550> force<00:04:02.880> now<00:04:03.750> when

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
that will keep that full force now when

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.170 
that will keep that full force now when
you<00:04:04.680> put<00:04:04.980> your<00:04:05.010> compressed<00:04:05.430> carbon<00:04:05.640> in<00:04:05.970> what's

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
you put your compressed carbon in what's

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.550 
you put your compressed carbon in what's
going<00:04:06.360> to<00:04:06.420> happen<00:04:06.750> is<00:04:06.870> it's<00:04:07.050> going<00:04:07.200> to<00:04:07.260> fill

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
going to happen is it's going to fill

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:14.720 
going to happen is it's going to fill
that<00:04:07.590> up<00:04:09.770> you<00:04:10.770> drop<00:04:11.130> your<00:04:13.100> new<00:04:14.100> enrich<00:04:14.400> diet

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
that up you drop your new enrich diet

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.340 
that up you drop your new enrich diet
into<00:04:15.060> the<00:04:15.180> slot<00:04:15.450> and<00:04:15.690> then<00:04:15.720> we're<00:04:16.049> going<00:04:16.140> to<00:04:16.230> go

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
into the slot and then we're going to go

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:22.700 
into the slot and then we're going to go
our<00:04:16.410> steel<00:04:16.709> dust<00:04:16.950> out<00:04:17.750> now<00:04:18.750> as<00:04:18.989> far<00:04:19.290> as<00:04:21.680> as<00:04:22.680> far

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
our steel dust out now as far as as far

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.990 
our steel dust out now as far as as far
as<00:04:25.400> give<00:04:26.400> us<00:04:26.490> another<00:04:26.700> one<00:04:26.760> of<00:04:26.940> those

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
as give us another one of those

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.660 
as give us another one of those
batteries<00:04:27.570> and<00:04:28.380> we'll<00:04:28.560> we'll<00:04:29.010> do<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.400> tin

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
batteries and we'll we'll do the tin

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.470 
batteries and we'll we'll do the tin
here<00:04:30.000> just<00:04:30.240> so<00:04:30.420> you<00:04:30.450> can<00:04:30.810> get<00:04:30.990> an<00:04:31.110> idea<00:04:31.230> of<00:04:32.480> how

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
here just so you can get an idea of how

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:41.870 
here just so you can get an idea of how
much<00:04:34.220> different<00:04:35.220> it<00:04:35.700> is<00:04:35.960> compared<00:04:36.960> to<00:04:40.820> so<00:04:41.820> if

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
much different it is compared to so if

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.060 
much different it is compared to so if
we<00:04:41.970> put<00:04:42.120> one<00:04:42.450> turn<00:04:42.750> in<00:04:44.270> actually<00:04:45.270> that's

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
we put one turn in actually that's

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.620 
we put one turn in actually that's
obviously<00:04:47.070> the<00:04:47.160> wrong<00:04:47.400> colleton<00:04:48.000> not<00:04:48.450> going

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
obviously the wrong colleton not going

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.580 
obviously the wrong colleton not going
to<00:04:48.690> work<00:04:50.480> where<00:04:51.480> is<00:04:51.600> the<00:04:51.720> tin<00:04:52.020> that's<00:04:52.320> going<00:04:52.530> to

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
to work where is the tin that's going to

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.990 
to work where is the tin that's going to
work<00:04:52.940> that<00:04:53.940> one<00:04:54.120> expects<00:04:55.250> what<00:04:56.250> would<00:04:56.460> not<00:04:56.730> in

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
work that one expects what would not in

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.490 
work that one expects what would not in
work<00:04:57.240> I<00:04:57.540> don't<00:04:57.900> know

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.080 

I<00:05:02.560> missed<00:05:03.370> in<00:05:03.670> dust<00:05:04.030> he<00:05:04.480> just<00:05:04.690> send<00:05:05.050> us<00:05:05.820> yeah<00:05:06.820> it

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
I missed in dust he just send us yeah it

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.600 
I missed in dust he just send us yeah it
looks<00:05:07.300> like<00:05:07.360> he<00:05:07.570> said<00:05:07.750> he'd<00:05:07.870> seen<00:05:08.110> dust<00:05:08.610> which

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
looks like he said he'd seen dust which

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.490 
looks like he said he'd seen dust which
you'd<00:05:09.910> have<00:05:10.090> to<00:05:10.240> pulverize<00:05:10.510> that<00:05:10.750> or<00:05:11.640> I<00:05:13.500> think

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
you'd have to pulverize that or I think

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.650 
you'd have to pulverize that or I think
did<00:05:14.890> that<00:05:14.920> our<00:05:15.490> is<00:05:15.820> the<00:05:16.030> the<00:05:16.810> other<00:05:17.080> machine<00:05:17.740> I

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
did that our is the the other machine I

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:25.170 
did that our is the the other machine I
was<00:05:19.660> talking<00:05:20.020> about<00:05:21.270> 10<00:05:22.270> dust<00:05:22.540> and<00:05:23.970> how<00:05:24.970> much

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
was talking about 10 dust and how much

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.760 
was talking about 10 dust and how much
bronze<00:05:26.050> can<00:05:26.440> we<00:05:26.560> get<00:05:26.770> out<00:05:26.950> of<00:05:27.090> 110<00:05:28.090> dust<00:05:28.770> now

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
bronze can we get out of 110 dust now

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.570 
bronze can we get out of 110 dust now
you<00:05:29.830> would<00:05:30.730> expect<00:05:31.030> to<00:05:31.210> get<00:05:31.390> for<00:05:32.020> I<00:05:32.470> think<00:05:33.010> if

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
you would expect to get for I think if

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:40.440 
you would expect to get for I think if
it<00:05:33.820> was<00:05:36.840> doing<00:05:37.840> the<00:05:37.930> usual<00:05:38.200> 1<00:05:38.710> 10<00:05:39.010> 23<00:05:39.490> copper<00:05:39.910> to

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.450 
it was doing the usual 1 10 23 copper to

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.710 
it was doing the usual 1 10 23 copper to
give<00:05:40.600> you<00:05:40.720> four<00:05:40.960> bonds<00:05:41.880> but<00:05:42.880> I<00:05:42.940> think<00:05:43.330> we<00:05:43.600> will

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
give you four bonds but I think we will

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.920 
give you four bonds but I think we will
get<00:05:43.930> a<00:05:44.200> little<00:05:44.770> bit<00:05:45.010> more<00:05:45.160> than<00:05:45.220> that<00:05:45.750> so<00:05:46.750> we'll

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
get a little bit more than that so we'll

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.200 
get a little bit more than that so we'll
let<00:05:47.080> that<00:05:47.110> one<00:05:47.440> and<00:05:48.220> we<00:05:48.460> can<00:05:48.640> have<00:05:48.790> a<00:05:48.820> look<00:05:48.970> here

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
let that one and we can have a look here

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.050 
let that one and we can have a look here
we've<00:05:49.450> got<00:05:49.480> steel<00:05:50.200> dust<00:05:50.700> slight<00:05:51.700> every

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
we've got steel dust slight every

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.490 
we've got steel dust slight every
enriched<00:05:52.390> iron<00:05:52.660> it's<00:05:52.870> going<00:05:53.080> to<00:05:53.140> give<00:05:53.260> us<00:05:53.350> a

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
enriched iron it's going to give us a

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.430 
enriched iron it's going to give us a
dust<00:05:53.770> and<00:05:54.240> G's<00:05:55.240> up<00:05:55.480> some<00:05:55.690> of<00:05:55.780> this<00:05:55.900> compressed

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
dust and G's up some of this compressed

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.210 
dust and G's up some of this compressed
carbon<00:05:57.210> which<00:05:58.210> if<00:05:58.480> we<00:05:58.630> take<00:05:58.840> that<00:05:59.050> out<00:05:59.230> you

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220 
carbon which if we take that out you

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:05.580 
carbon which if we take that out you
will<00:06:00.370> see<00:06:01.560> gradually<00:06:02.560> to<00:06:02.919> please<00:06:04.590> hopefully

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
will see gradually to please hopefully

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.460 
will see gradually to please hopefully
you'll<00:06:05.710> see<00:06:05.890> that<00:06:06.040> in<00:06:06.910> a<00:06:07.030> second<00:06:07.479> it's<00:06:08.200> quite

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
you'll see that in a second it's quite

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.620 
you'll see that in a second it's quite
dark<00:06:08.770> this<00:06:09.070> quite<00:06:09.550> hard<00:06:09.790> to<00:06:09.880> see<00:06:10.150> the<00:06:10.330> dark

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
dark this quite hard to see the dark

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.800 
dark this quite hard to see the dark
line<00:06:10.990> yeah<00:06:11.470> he's<00:06:11.770> a<00:06:11.850> dark<00:06:12.850> line<00:06:13.090> on<00:06:13.360> a<00:06:13.390> dark

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
line yeah he's a dark line on a dark

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.330 
line yeah he's a dark line on a dark
background<00:06:13.900> makes<00:06:14.530> a<00:06:14.680> little<00:06:14.919> bit<00:06:15.130> difficult

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:15.340 
background makes a little bit difficult

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.900 
background makes a little bit difficult
saber<00:06:15.870> and<00:06:16.870> is<00:06:16.990> there<00:06:17.350> and<00:06:18.160> this<00:06:18.340> we're<00:06:18.640> up<00:06:18.760> to

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:18.910 
saber and is there and this we're up to

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.240 
saber and is there and this we're up to
find<00:06:19.210> bones<00:06:19.510> Inga's<00:06:19.990> however<00:06:20.410> wanting<00:06:20.890> dust

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.250

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:25.380 
find bones Inga's however wanting dust
already<00:06:22.110> which<00:06:23.110> strikes<00:06:23.770> me<00:06:23.919> is<00:06:24.090> pretty<00:06:25.090> good

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 
then you're going to warm one of these

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.950 
then you're going to warm one of these
machines<00:06:32.800> to<00:06:33.220> get<00:06:33.370> your<00:06:33.490> bones<00:06:33.960> definitely

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 
machines to get your bones definitely

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:42.290 
machines to get your bones definitely
cuz<00:06:36.540> that<00:06:37.540> looks<00:06:37.960> like<00:06:39.300> want<00:06:40.300> into<00:06:40.840> a<00:06:40.870> copper

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300 
cuz that looks like want into a copper

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:47.460 
cuz that looks like want into a copper
pretty<00:06:43.300> much<00:06:44.910> or<00:06:45.910> maybe<00:06:46.390> is<00:06:46.630> even<00:06:46.900> more<00:06:47.050> nine

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:47.470 
pretty much or maybe is even more nine

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.439 
pretty much or maybe is even more nine
ten<00:06:48.010> they're<00:06:48.940> going<00:06:49.030> to<00:06:49.120> be<00:06:49.210> 10

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:51.449 
ten they're going to be 10

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:53.990 
ten they're going to be 10
there<00:06:52.449> we<00:06:52.630> go<00:06:52.750> you<00:06:53.199> can<00:06:53.350> see<00:06:53.500> this<00:06:53.620> part

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 
there we go you can see this part

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.129 
there we go you can see this part
gradually<00:06:55.000> coming<00:06:55.210> down<00:06:55.449> some<00:06:56.410> below<00:06:56.620> 10<00:06:58.139> so

00:06:59.129 --> 00:06:59.139 
gradually coming down some below 10 so

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:02.909 
gradually coming down some below 10 so
as<00:06:59.440> you<00:06:59.680> can<00:06:59.800> see<00:07:00.690> definitely<00:07:01.690> a<00:07:02.050> very<00:07:02.320> good

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:02.919 
as you can see definitely a very good

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:07.620 
as you can see definitely a very good
way<00:07:03.100> making<00:07:03.370> bonds<00:07:05.010> we<00:07:06.010> will<00:07:06.250> have<00:07:07.090> a<00:07:07.120> look<00:07:07.389> at

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:07.630 
way making bonds we will have a look at

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:11.010 
way making bonds we will have a look at
the<00:07:08.020> other<00:07:08.340> machine<00:07:09.340> which<00:07:09.970> i<00:07:10.419> believe<00:07:10.660> is

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:11.020 
the other machine which i believe is

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.260 
the other machine which i believe is
this<00:07:11.290> one<00:07:11.470> here<00:07:11.680> the<00:07:11.830> enrichment<00:07:12.130> chamber<00:07:12.400> as

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:13.270 
this one here the enrichment chamber as

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.060 
this one here the enrichment chamber as
you're<00:07:13.720> doubling<00:07:14.260> one<00:07:14.470> that's<00:07:14.740> where<00:07:14.949> you're

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:15.070 
you're doubling one that's where you're

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.390 
you're doubling one that's where you're
going<00:07:15.190> to<00:07:15.280> get<00:07:15.400> your<00:07:15.550> tin<00:07:15.820> dust<00:07:16.120> from<00:07:17.400> we'll

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 
going to get your tin dust from we'll

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.200 
going to get your tin dust from we'll
take<00:07:18.669> a<00:07:18.699> look<00:07:18.940> at<00:07:19.060> that<00:07:19.240> next<00:07:19.720> time<00:07:19.900> and

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:21.210 
take a look at that next time and

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:24.629 
take a look at that next time and
hopefully<00:07:22.440> you'll<00:07:23.440> start<00:07:24.040> to<00:07:24.100> get<00:07:24.340> a<00:07:24.370> bit<00:07:24.430> of

00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:24.639 
hopefully you'll start to get a bit of

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:28.740 
hopefully you'll start to get a bit of
an<00:07:24.729> idea<00:07:24.960> how<00:07:25.960> to<00:07:26.020> style<00:07:26.700> with<00:07:27.700> the<00:07:27.750> universal

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:28.750 
an idea how to style with the universal
