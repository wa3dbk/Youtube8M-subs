00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
here's the back view and you could just

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.060 
here's the back view and you could just
it<00:03:14.400> doesn't<00:03:14.790> come<00:03:15.000> with<00:03:15.269> the<00:03:15.600> USB<00:03:16.079> to<00:03:16.620> 30-pin

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
it doesn't come with the USB to 30-pin

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.420 
it doesn't come with the USB to 30-pin
connector<00:03:17.239> but<00:03:18.239> um<00:03:18.510> you'll<00:03:19.440> probably<00:03:19.920> have

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
connector but um you'll probably have

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.620 
connector but um you'll probably have
one<00:03:20.610> of<00:03:20.640> those<00:03:20.820> I<00:03:21.799> assume<00:03:22.799> at<00:03:23.700> first<00:03:24.269> it<00:03:24.600> might

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
one of those I assume at first it might

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.400 
one of those I assume at first it might
be<00:03:25.049> a<00:03:25.079> little<00:03:25.260> bit<00:03:25.470> annoying<00:03:25.739> to<00:03:26.730> UM<00:03:27.150> try<00:03:28.049> and

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
be a little bit annoying to UM try and

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.680 
be a little bit annoying to UM try and
put<00:03:29.370> that<00:03:29.760> in<00:03:30.000> there<00:03:30.239> and<00:03:32.150> you're<00:03:33.150> pulling<00:03:33.420> it

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
put that in there and you're pulling it

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.150 
put that in there and you're pulling it
in<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:33.989> out<00:03:34.049> I<00:03:34.320> think<00:03:34.590> that<00:03:34.680> you<00:03:34.769> might<00:03:34.950> just

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
in and out I think that you might just

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.750 
in and out I think that you might just
have<00:03:35.310> to<00:03:35.480> hold<00:03:36.480> your<00:03:36.720> hand<00:03:36.900> there<00:03:37.610> pull<00:03:38.610> it

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
have to hold your hand there pull it

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.090 
have to hold your hand there pull it
right<00:03:38.850> up<00:03:39.590> sitting<00:03:40.590> it<00:03:40.709> back<00:03:40.920> down<00:03:42.860> so<00:03:43.860> you<00:03:43.890> it

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
right up sitting it back down so you it

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.870 
right up sitting it back down so you it
again<00:03:44.340> here<00:03:45.269> you<00:03:45.360> can<00:03:45.510> just<00:03:46.370> just<00:03:47.370> pulling<00:03:47.790> it

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
again here you can just just pulling it

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.250 
again here you can just just pulling it
with<00:03:47.970> both<00:03:48.150> your<00:03:48.299> hands<00:03:48.480> won't<00:03:48.660> work<00:03:48.930> i<00:03:49.110> don't

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
with both your hands won't work i don't

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.890 
with both your hands won't work i don't
think<00:03:49.470> you<00:03:50.280> might<00:03:50.430> have<00:03:50.519> to<00:03:50.670> hold<00:03:50.910> your<00:03:51.269> finger

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
think you might have to hold your finger

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.360 
think you might have to hold your finger
just<00:03:52.100> right<00:03:53.100> there<00:03:53.370> pull<00:03:53.910> it<00:03:54.060> up<00:03:54.180> and<00:03:55.370> you

just right there pull it up and you

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:18.360 
just right there pull it up and you
could<00:03:56.519> put<00:03:56.760> it<00:03:56.850> right<00:03:57.390> back<00:03:58.230> in<00:03:58.650> there
