a more people can join right now I have

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.260 
a more people can join right now I have
set<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.200> up<00:01:19.320> 20<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.400> if<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.549> said<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.850> any<00:01:20.970> higher

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
set it up 20 and if I said it any higher

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.749 
set it up 20 and if I said it any higher
than<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.600> we<00:01:21.960> get<00:01:22.170> some<00:01:22.350> lag<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:23.250> I'm<00:01:23.400> hoping

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
than that we get some lag so I'm hoping

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.539 
than that we get some lag so I'm hoping
to<00:01:23.880> amp<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.210> up<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.509> whole<00:01:24.689> lot<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.110> then<00:01:25.549> it

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
to amp that up a whole lot and then it

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.999 
to amp that up a whole lot and then it
will<00:01:26.670> just<00:01:26.820> run<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.030> lot<00:01:27.240> better<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.920> we'll<00:01:28.920> get

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
will just run a lot better and we'll get

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.800 
will just run a lot better and we'll get
have<00:01:29.130> more<00:01:29.340> people<00:01:29.579> more<00:01:30.180> bending<00:01:30.600> more
