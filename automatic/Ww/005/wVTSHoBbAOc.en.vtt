it's got cornering lights and all of
this<00:01:23.460> stuff<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:24.229> integrated<00:01:25.229> into<00:01:25.380> one<00:01:25.649> system

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
this stuff is integrated into one system

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.080 
this stuff is integrated into one system
that<00:01:26.369> works<00:01:27.060> off<00:01:27.300> the<00:01:27.479> bank<00:01:27.690> angle<00:01:28.280> sensors<00:01:29.280> so

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
that works off the bank angle sensors so

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.320 
that works off the bank angle sensors so
you've<00:01:30.270> got<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.479> all<00:01:30.600> working<00:01:31.050> together

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
you've got it all working together

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.690 
you've got it all working together
