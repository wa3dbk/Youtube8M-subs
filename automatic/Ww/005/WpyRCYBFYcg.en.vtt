on<00:00:18.130> the<00:00:18.190> round<00:00:19.200> okay<00:00:20.200> so<00:00:20.260> there's<00:00:20.590> two<00:00:20.650> kinds

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
on the round okay so there's two kinds

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.070 
on the round okay so there's two kinds
of<00:00:21.280> kick<00:00:21.460> turns<00:00:21.700> and<00:00:22.090> it's<00:00:22.840> basically

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
don't want to do that or you might slide

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.350 
don't want to do that or you might slide
out<00:01:47.929> with<00:01:48.890> your<00:01:49.039> foot<00:01:49.250> on<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:49.429> tail<00:01:49.459> putting<00:01:50.299> a

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
little bit of weight slowly make that

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.240 
little bit of weight slowly make that
rotation<00:01:52.909> and<00:01:53.439> plant<00:01:54.439> that<00:01:54.649> front<00:01:54.950> wheel<00:01:55.069> down

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
rotation and plant that front wheel down

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:03.390 
rotation and plant that front wheel down
and<00:01:55.310> ride<00:01:55.819> away<00:01:55.970> smooth

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.550 

all<00:02:04.400> right<00:02:04.580> to<00:02:04.760> the<00:02:04.790> front<00:02:05.090> sight<00:02:05.360> picture<00:02:05.750> the

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
all right to the front sight picture the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.440 
all right to the front sight picture the
same<00:02:06.770> kind<00:02:07.160> of<00:02:07.250> rules<00:02:07.460> ring<00:02:07.880> true<00:02:08.149> is<00:02:08.300> the

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
same kind of rules ring true is the

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.810 
same kind of rules ring true is the
backside<00:02:08.930> kickturn<00:02:09.320> but<00:02:10.009> of<00:02:10.490> course<00:02:10.700> the

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
backside kickturn but of course the

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.010 
backside kickturn but of course the
front<00:02:11.030> sight<00:02:11.180> kicked<00:02:11.360> our<00:02:11.480> it's<00:02:11.570> a<00:02:11.630> little<00:02:11.900> bit

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
front sight kicked our it's a little bit

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.630 
front sight kicked our it's a little bit
scarier<00:02:12.470> because<00:02:12.770> you're<00:02:12.890> you're<00:02:13.370> actually

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
scarier because you're you're actually

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.750 
scarier because you're you're actually
hitting<00:02:13.850> it<00:02:14.030> at<00:02:14.420> sort<00:02:14.780> of<00:02:14.870> a<00:02:14.960> blind<00:02:15.400> way<00:02:16.400> so

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
hitting it at sort of a blind way so

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.060 
hitting it at sort of a blind way so
you're<00:02:16.910> riding<00:02:17.660> at<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:17.840> coping<00:02:18.230> you're<00:02:18.920> not

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
you're riding at the coping you're not

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.590 
you're riding at the coping you're not
really<00:02:19.280> able<00:02:19.430> to<00:02:19.580> see<00:02:19.670> where<00:02:20.090> you're<00:02:20.210> going

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
really able to see where you're going

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.550 
really able to see where you're going
behind<00:02:20.990> you

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
behind you

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.200 
behind you
so<00:02:21.770> it's<00:02:21.920> a<00:02:21.950> little<00:02:22.100> bit<00:02:22.280> scarier<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.970> same

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
so it's a little bit scarier the same

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.150 
so it's a little bit scarier the same
rules<00:02:23.450> applies<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:23.870> backside<00:02:24.260> turn<00:02:24.440> you<00:02:25.070> want

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
rules applies the backside turn you want

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.650 
rules applies the backside turn you want
to<00:02:25.280> keep<00:02:25.430> your<00:02:25.640> weight<00:02:25.790> inside<00:02:26.450> the

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
to keep your weight inside the

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.020 
to keep your weight inside the
transition<00:02:27.260> that's<00:02:28.040> very<00:02:28.340> crucial<00:02:28.610> you<00:02:28.850> don't

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
transition that's very crucial you don't

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.880 
transition that's very crucial you don't
want<00:02:29.180> to<00:02:29.270> be<00:02:29.420> too<00:02:29.690> far<00:02:29.990> up<00:02:30.110> in<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:30.320> transition

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
want to be too far up in the transition

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.320 
want to be too far up in the transition
with<00:02:31.040> your<00:02:31.160> weight<00:02:31.310> in<00:02:31.520> because<00:02:32.030> what<00:02:32.210> will

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
with your weight in because what will

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.420 
with your weight in because what will
happen<00:02:32.360> is<00:02:32.630> rewards<00:02:33.050> going<00:02:33.230> to<00:02:33.290> slide<00:02:33.560> out<00:02:33.740> so

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
happen is rewards going to slide out so

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.950 
happen is rewards going to slide out so
you<00:02:34.490> want<00:02:34.610> to<00:02:34.670> keep<00:02:34.850> that<00:02:35.030> weight<00:02:35.300> back<00:02:35.630> in<00:02:35.870> the

you want to keep that weight back in the
transition<00:02:36.580> start<00:02:37.580> to<00:02:37.790> adjust<00:02:38.090> your<00:02:38.210> weight
