00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.900

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
really thought we had that what went

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
really thought we had that what went
wrong<00:00:38.360> I<00:00:38.900> think<00:00:39.430> maybe<00:00:40.430> we<00:00:41.210> didn't<00:00:41.750> do

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
wrong I think maybe we didn't do

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.630 
wrong I think maybe we didn't do
anything<00:00:42.170> we<00:00:42.410> said<00:00:42.650> I<00:00:43.040> think<00:00:43.100> you're<00:00:43.490> onto

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640

something through let me try it how
about<00:00:46.190> this<00:00:46.520> time<00:00:46.760> two<00:00:47.570> of<00:00:47.690> us<00:00:47.840> go<00:00:47.990> for<00:00:48.020> the

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200

our chances of hitting it and then one

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.580 
our chances of hitting it and then one
