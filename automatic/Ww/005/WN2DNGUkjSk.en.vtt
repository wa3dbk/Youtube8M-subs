00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.700 
tractor we ordered it with a 12 foot
blade<00:00:24.789> you<00:00:25.510> can<00:00:25.539> get<00:00:25.840> different<00:00:26.199> sizes<00:00:26.560> from

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
blade you can get different sizes from

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.590 
blade you can get different sizes from
10<00:00:26.949> foot<00:00:27.189> up<00:00:27.310> we<00:00:27.490> went<00:00:27.670> 12<00:00:27.970> foot<00:00:28.180> to<00:00:28.269> give<00:00:28.420> us<00:00:28.510> a

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:28.600 
10 foot up we went 12 foot to give us a

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.349 
10 foot up we went 12 foot to give us a
bit<00:00:28.720> extra<00:00:28.960> width<00:00:29.260> we<00:00:30.039> also<00:00:30.220> got<00:00:30.640> special

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:31.359 
bit extra width we also got special

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.869 
bit extra width we also got special
wings<00:00:31.539> made<00:00:31.840> up<00:00:31.990> on<00:00:32.140> the<00:00:32.230> side<00:00:32.500> so<00:00:33.460> we<00:00:33.580> can<00:00:33.730> also

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:33.879 
wings made up on the side so we can also

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:36.930 
wings made up on the side so we can also
use<00:00:34.059> it<00:00:34.390> as<00:00:34.480> a<00:00:34.870> drag<00:00:35.230> bucket<00:00:35.680> to<00:00:35.890> shift<00:00:36.520> dirt<00:00:36.760> if

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
use it as a drag bucket to shift dirt if

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.020 
use it as a drag bucket to shift dirt if
we<00:00:37.059> need<00:00:37.239> to<00:00:37.270> so<00:00:37.690> it's<00:00:38.440> fairly<00:00:38.770> versatile<00:00:39.550> for

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
we need to so it's fairly versatile for

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.500 
we need to so it's fairly versatile for
what<00:00:40.510> we<00:00:40.660> require<00:00:41.340> we<00:00:42.340> use<00:00:42.730> it<00:00:42.910> pretty<00:00:43.120> much<00:00:43.239> to

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
what we require we use it pretty much to

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.560 
what we require we use it pretty much to
contour<00:00:43.930> the<00:00:44.079> roads<00:00:44.879> but<00:00:45.879> we<00:00:45.940> would<00:00:46.270> like<00:00:46.390> to

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
contour the roads but we would like to

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.770 
contour the roads but we would like to
have<00:00:46.719> a<00:00:46.750> better<00:00:46.960> 6<00:00:47.350> metre<00:00:47.590> flat<00:00:48.100> area<00:00:48.489> with

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
have a better 6 metre flat area with

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.240 
have a better 6 metre flat area with
contours<00:00:49.780> on<00:00:49.960> each<00:00:50.110> side<00:00:50.379> leading<00:00:50.739> into<00:00:51.129> the

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
contours on each side leading into the

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.740 
contours on each side leading into the
rows<00:00:51.460> so<00:00:51.789> we<00:00:51.879> can<00:00:52.000> get<00:00:52.120> the<00:00:52.210> water<00:00:52.360> away<00:00:52.600> from

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
rows so we can get the water away from

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.840 
rows so we can get the water away from
running<00:00:53.739> down<00:00:53.860> the<00:00:54.070> rows<00:00:54.250> down<00:00:54.520> the<00:00:54.670> main

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
running down the rows down the main

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.819 
running down the rows down the main
roads<00:00:55.120> so<00:00:55.899> we<00:00:56.050> find<00:00:56.320> with<00:00:56.469> fall<00:00:56.649> it's

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
roads so we find with fall it's

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.040 
roads so we find with fall it's
adjustment<00:00:57.340> it's<00:00:57.460> quite<00:00:57.730> quite<00:00:58.420> handy<00:00:58.809> to<00:00:58.840> do

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
adjustment it's quite quite handy to do

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.000 
adjustment it's quite quite handy to do
all<00:00:59.199> that<00:01:00.120> it's<00:01:01.120> pretty<00:01:01.570> versatile<00:01:02.170> if<00:01:02.379> we<00:01:02.649> can

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
all that it's pretty versatile if we can

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.829 
all that it's pretty versatile if we can
roll<00:01:03.430> to<00:01:03.460> one<00:01:03.670> side<00:01:03.820> of<00:01:04.239> the<00:01:04.330> track<00:01:04.570> that<00:01:04.720> we

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
roll to one side of the track that we

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.050 
roll to one side of the track that we
can<00:01:04.989> put<00:01:05.619> it<00:01:05.740> in<00:01:05.860> whichever<00:01:06.190> angle<00:01:06.520> we<00:01:06.789> really

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
can put it in whichever angle we really

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.270 
can put it in whichever angle we really
want<00:01:07.270> like<00:01:07.900> I<00:01:07.960> said<00:01:08.229> you<00:01:08.320> can<00:01:08.439> drag<00:01:08.710> do<00:01:09.010> it<00:01:09.100> with

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
want like I said you can drag do it with

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.340 
want like I said you can drag do it with
it<00:01:09.490> you<00:01:09.729> can<00:01:09.880> use<00:01:10.240> it<00:01:10.390> as<00:01:10.540> a<00:01:10.570> straight<00:01:11.080> flat

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
it you can use it as a straight flat

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.429 
it you can use it as a straight flat
blade<00:01:11.650> or<00:01:11.950> you<00:01:12.820> can<00:01:12.939> pull<00:01:13.270> up<00:01:13.299> channels<00:01:14.580> kovetz

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
blade or you can pull up channels kovetz

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.410 
blade or you can pull up channels kovetz
yeah<00:01:17.439> the<00:01:17.590> road<00:01:17.770> grade<00:01:18.010> is<00:01:18.189> good<00:01:18.430> on<00:01:18.610> hydraulic

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
yeah the road grade is good on hydraulic

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.560 
yeah the road grade is good on hydraulic
wheels<00:01:19.840> at<00:01:20.080> the<00:01:20.110> back<00:01:20.290> to<00:01:20.680> steer<00:01:21.280> it<00:01:21.570> which

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
wheels at the back to steer it which

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.690 
wheels at the back to steer it which
helps<00:01:22.750> in<00:01:23.229> tight<00:01:23.650> areas<00:01:23.680> you<00:01:24.430> can<00:01:24.549> actually

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
helps in tight areas you can actually

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.460 
helps in tight areas you can actually
throw<00:01:24.970> the<00:01:25.180> machine<00:01:25.479> around<00:01:25.720> giving<00:01:26.020> you<00:01:26.229> a

and pretty much once you've set the
wheels<00:01:55.390> in<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:56.259> centre<00:01:56.530> of<00:01:56.590> the<00:01:56.740> tractor

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
wheels in the centre of the tractor

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.639 
wheels in the centre of the tractor
it'll<00:01:57.880> just<00:01:58.119> track<00:01:58.390> there<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:58.720> whole<00:01:58.899> time<00:01:59.200> so

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
it'll just track there the whole time so

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:02.459 
it'll just track there the whole time so
we<00:02:00.610> do<00:02:00.729> put<00:02:00.909> safety<00:02:01.149> devices<00:02:01.689> on<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.140> in<00:02:02.259> case

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:02.469 
we do put safety devices on the in case

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:05.280 
we do put safety devices on the in case
our<00:02:02.619> hose<00:02:02.799> blows<00:02:03.100> but<00:02:03.369> as<00:02:03.880> far<00:02:04.630> as<00:02:04.659> tracking<00:02:05.049> it

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
our hose blows but as far as tracking it

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.550 
our hose blows but as far as tracking it
sits<00:02:05.500> very<00:02:05.590> well<00:02:06.509> yeah<00:02:07.509> this<00:02:07.990> units<00:02:08.410> actually

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
sits very well yeah this units actually

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.680 
sits very well yeah this units actually
set<00:02:08.890> up<00:02:08.920> with<00:02:09.160> four<00:02:09.399> sets<00:02:09.670> of<00:02:09.850> remotes<00:02:10.149> as<00:02:10.360> our

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
set up with four sets of remotes as our

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.320 
set up with four sets of remotes as our
track<00:02:10.899> down<00:02:11.110> has<00:02:11.379> four<00:02:11.650> sets<00:02:11.920> of<00:02:12.010> remotes<00:02:12.370> but

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
track down has four sets of remotes but

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.790 
track down has four sets of remotes but
I<00:02:13.420> have<00:02:13.540> seen<00:02:13.780> them<00:02:13.870> set<00:02:14.110> up<00:02:14.140> with<00:02:14.379> electric

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
I have seen them set up with electric

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.530 
I have seen them set up with electric
over<00:02:15.040> hydraulic<00:02:15.069> so<00:02:15.670> you<00:02:15.790> can<00:02:15.940> do<00:02:16.060> it<00:02:16.120> with

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
over hydraulic so you can do it with

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.229 
over hydraulic so you can do it with
switches<00:02:17.040> they're<00:02:18.040> quite<00:02:18.250> open<00:02:18.610> to<00:02:18.640> do<00:02:18.909> it<00:02:19.060> as

switches they're quite open to do it as

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:19.649 
switches they're quite open to do it as
you<00:02:19.390> want

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:19.659

we're<00:02:20.200> only<00:02:20.349> telling<00:02:20.799> this<00:02:21.010> machine<00:02:21.400> with<00:02:21.549> 135

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
we're only telling this machine with 135

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.940 
we're only telling this machine with 135
volts<00:02:22.569> bad<00:02:22.840> wreck<00:02:23.140> though<00:02:23.319> and<00:02:23.590> it<00:02:23.769> does<00:02:23.920> a

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
volts bad wreck though and it does a

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.860 
volts bad wreck though and it does a
quite<00:02:24.250> comfortably

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.339 

as<00:02:28.310> an<00:02:29.310> extra<00:02:29.580> weight<00:02:29.849> as<00:02:30.030> we<00:02:30.840> wanted<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.230> little

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
as an extra weight as we wanted a little

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:32.930 
as an extra weight as we wanted a little
bit<00:02:31.590> more<00:02:31.739> weight<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.129> make<00:02:32.310> sure<00:02:32.489> it<00:02:32.640> dug<00:02:32.910> a

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
bit more weight to make sure it dug a

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.509 
bit more weight to make sure it dug a
bit<00:02:33.180> easier<00:02:33.510> we<00:02:34.200> actually<00:02:34.590> got<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:35.220> boys<00:02:35.400> of

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
bit easier we actually got the boys of

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.910 
bit easier we actually got the boys of
color<00:02:35.640> monitor<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.599> put<00:02:36.840> concrete<00:02:37.050> from<00:02:37.620> about

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
color monitor to put concrete from about

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.699 
color monitor to put concrete from about
here<00:02:38.340> back<00:02:38.550> and<00:02:38.760> on<00:02:39.269> the<00:02:39.540> back<00:02:39.720> section<00:02:39.930> so

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
here back and on the back section so

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.110 
here back and on the back section so
this<00:02:40.920> chassis<00:02:41.220> is<00:02:41.489> actually<00:02:41.879> full<00:02:42.090> of

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
this chassis is actually full of

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.839 
this chassis is actually full of
concrete<00:02:42.530> and<00:02:43.530> add<00:02:43.680> extra<00:02:44.040> weight<00:02:44.250> on<00:02:44.459> top<00:02:44.700> of

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
concrete and add extra weight on top of

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:46.850 
concrete and add extra weight on top of
the<00:02:44.940> blade<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:45.450> I'm<00:02:46.230> we're<00:02:46.410> actually<00:02:46.500> putting

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
the blade and I'm we're actually putting

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.949 
the blade and I'm we're actually putting
water<00:02:47.099> in<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.370> wheels<00:02:47.610> as<00:02:47.849> well<00:02:48.030> just<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.599> give

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
water in the wheels as well just to give

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.610 
water in the wheels as well just to give
it<00:02:48.989> more<00:02:49.310> stability<00:02:50.310> and<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:51.269> helps<00:02:51.690> it<00:02:51.930> bite

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
it more stability and and helps it bite

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.970 
it more stability and and helps it bite
in<00:02:52.799> a<00:02:52.920> bit<00:02:53.069> easier<00:02:53.459> so<00:02:54.440> that's<00:02:55.440> an<00:02:55.650> option<00:02:55.950> that

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
in a bit easier so that's an option that

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.730 
in a bit easier so that's an option that
we<00:02:56.220> wanted<00:02:56.580> and<00:02:56.849> are<00:02:57.269> quite<00:02:57.510> happy<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:57.870> do<00:02:57.989> it

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.410 

column<00:03:03.310> L<00:03:03.430> have<00:03:03.520> been<00:03:03.670> really<00:03:03.910> really<00:03:04.209> good

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
column L have been really really good

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.590 
column L have been really really good
with<00:03:04.600> their<00:03:04.810> backup<00:03:05.260> servers<00:03:05.709> we<00:03:06.540> needed<00:03:07.540> a

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
with their backup servers we needed a

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.270 
with their backup servers we needed a
few<00:03:07.750> little<00:03:07.900> modifications<00:03:08.740> done<00:03:08.950> pretty

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
few little modifications done pretty

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.300
