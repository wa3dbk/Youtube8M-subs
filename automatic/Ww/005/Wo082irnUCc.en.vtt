 we have the incomplete series I share 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.680
 I searched the internet and found an option 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.050
 learn 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.040
 in this page 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:42.660
 10 many of us do not have 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:46.100
 aware and good is this story I 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.100
 liked since they are of alternate dimensions 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.100
 different 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:57.390
 616 2 the land 616 in ours 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.030
 our dimension where there is no 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:05.339
 superhero good if they exist but without 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:08.759
 any good power in this school has 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.570
 liked it a lot because it tells you a 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:14.000
 sequence of a virus 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.070
 does not know where it originated they say that the 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.640
 contact and ccoo x thing 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.640
 good 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.560
 I'm sleepy I still just got up 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.810
 good does not matter 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.740
 each one has a different story 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:34.460
 The most common or known is this 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:37.070
 of sea ​​version seen in it a slight this 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:41.000
 shape of the astronomy camera because 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:43.280
 is where the spider man order pp is 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.009
 turns into the euro zombie but for that 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.659
 have to sacrifice certain things in 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:52.549
 this part is the cure of this dimension 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:55.009
 about the virus although there will be no 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.950
 no other good living being like that 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.049
