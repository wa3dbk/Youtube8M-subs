 Hello minecraft, we prod 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.210
 im already playing with you in town car 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:21.140
 Rome and today we will build an altar 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:24.170
 on filling magic items for this 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:27.020
 you will need to study the content 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.210
 magic items further to collect 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:33.170
 runic matrix here it is going 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:36.590
 so what do we need 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:39.020
 you need this runic matrix 5 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.590
 magical pedestals this will be the most 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.420
 ordinary altar for filling items 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.480
 magic can then be delivered 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:51.380
 magical pedestals and you collect all 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.870
 whatever further you are going you 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:57.280
 should have more precisely a 4 magical 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:00.200
 stones and 4 magic bricks 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:04.250
 we start building well, I liked it 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:07.820
 place here we put bricks it 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:12.110
 lower part further we put on top on 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:14.390
 they are ordinary runic magical stones 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:19.460
 matrix we will need to put here 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.780
 so here it is to the lands and then 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.060
 so here 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.789
 we delete such a construction from you 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.240
 Should get further have in 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:33.439
 go magical become 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:38.229
 1 we put on the centers now where 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:38.229
 items will actually climb 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:51.270
 now what else do you need 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:53.330
 you will need a rod and a charge in it for 25 of 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.990
 each aspect 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:02:03.050
 that's how you see i have it all 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:06.360
 everything is set in place now we 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:11.070
 point to the rune matrix of the rod and 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:14.250
 click the right mouse button here and turned 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.260
 all so earned see how cool 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:23.040
 logical matrix now you basically 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:26.940
 you can run it all 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.850
 quite simply so you have problems 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.830
 special should not arise 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:38.370
 with you was a paranoid killer I hope you 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:43.280
 this guide is useful to me this video 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.280
 so wish you good luck in the game
