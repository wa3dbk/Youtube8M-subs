the jump ring from Argentine wire
argenteum<00:00:57.480> twist<00:00:57.750> wire<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.260> then<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:58.829> wrapped

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
argenteum twist wire and then I wrapped

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.599 
argenteum twist wire and then I wrapped
it<00:00:59.280> around<00:00:59.309> the<00:01:00.050> ring<00:01:01.050> mandrel<00:01:01.399> yeah<00:01:02.399> it's

really pretty let's show them what this

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.609 
really pretty let's show them what this
fire<00:01:04.049> looks<00:01:04.379> like<00:01:05.390> it's<00:01:06.390> already<00:01:06.570> twisted<00:01:06.930> and

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
fire looks like it's already twisted and

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.410 
fire looks like it's already twisted and
then<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.189> wrap<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.400> around<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.880> mandrel<00:01:09.090> the

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
then you wrap it around a mandrel the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.060 
then you wrap it around a mandrel the
size<00:01:09.630> jump<00:01:10.200> ring<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.560> need<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.830> fit<00:01:10.979> your

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
size jump ring that you need to fit your

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.609 
size jump ring that you need to fit your
disc<00:01:11.310> right<00:01:11.610> right<00:01:11.970> right<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:13.200> did<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.439> just

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
disc right right right so did you just

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.219 
disc right right right so did you just
test<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:14.010> by<00:01:14.130> laying<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.460> on<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.610> disc<00:01:15.170> right<00:01:16.170> I

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
test it by laying it on the disc right I

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.340 
test it by laying it on the disc right I
do<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.009> just<00:01:17.189> kind<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.400> get<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.610> close<00:01:17.850> and

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
do and I just kind of get it close and

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.899 
do and I just kind of get it close and
then<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.860> fuse<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.280> just<00:01:20.400> need<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.670> put<00:01:20.880> a

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
then to fuse it I just need to put a

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.160 
then to fuse it I just need to put a
little<00:01:21.259> flux<00:01:22.259> right<00:01:22.380> here<00:01:22.590> on<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.369> seam<00:01:24.170> and

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
little flux right here on the seam and

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.870 
little flux right here on the seam and
you<00:01:25.229> laid<00:01:25.439> on<00:01:25.470> there<00:01:25.830> so<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.250> fuse<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.729> ring

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
you laid on there so you fuse the ring

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.850 
you laid on there so you fuse the ring
first<00:01:27.150> before<00:01:27.420> attaching<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.500> anything

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
first before attaching it to anything

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.050 
first before attaching it to anything
right<00:01:29.159> because<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.549> don't<00:01:29.670> make<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.790> round

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
right because you don't make it round

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.830 
right because you don't make it round
and<00:01:30.990> this<00:01:31.770> will<00:01:31.950> go<00:01:32.040> pretty<00:01:32.070> quick

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.499 

eat<00:01:35.530> it<00:01:35.619> up<00:01:35.740> and<00:01:36.670> what<00:01:36.790> you're<00:01:36.850> looking<00:01:37.090> for<00:01:37.329> is

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
eat it up and what you're looking for is

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:39.149 
eat it up and what you're looking for is
in<00:01:37.630> battles<00:01:37.869> gonna<00:01:37.990> start<00:01:38.229> to<00:01:38.290> turn<00:01:38.439> kind<00:01:39.100> of

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
in battles gonna start to turn kind of

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.550 
in battles gonna start to turn kind of
oranjee<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:40.540> you<00:01:40.600> didn't<00:01:40.840> put<00:01:40.960> any<00:01:41.079> solder<00:01:41.380> on

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
oranjee so you didn't put any solder on

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.499 
oranjee so you didn't put any solder on
this<00:01:41.740> it<00:01:41.890> was<00:01:41.979> just<00:01:42.189> flux<00:01:42.460> just<00:01:42.909> flux<00:01:43.210> right

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
this it was just flux just flux right

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:44.760 
this it was just flux just flux right
there<00:01:43.689> at<00:01:43.750> the<00:01:43.869> seam<00:01:44.079> and<00:01:44.350> that's<00:01:44.470> gonna<00:01:44.590> keep

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
there at the seam and that's gonna keep

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.980 
there at the seam and that's gonna keep
the<00:01:44.920> oxygen<00:01:45.100> away<00:01:45.490> so<00:01:46.329> that<00:01:46.479> the<00:01:46.600> seam<00:01:46.810> will

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
the oxygen away so that the seam will

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.760 
the oxygen away so that the seam will
hold<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:49.299> happened<00:01:49.750> already<00:01:49.899> yeah<00:01:50.409> look<00:01:50.649> at

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
hold it happened already yeah look at

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.820 
hold it happened already yeah look at
that<00:01:50.799> it's<00:01:51.250> very<00:01:51.520> quick<00:01:51.850> so<00:01:52.450> it's<00:01:52.600> seamless<00:01:52.960> it

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
that it's very quick so it's seamless it

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.679 
that it's very quick so it's seamless it
is<00:01:53.979> now<00:01:54.159> yes<00:01:54.490> and<00:01:55.030> then<00:01:55.330> what<00:01:55.420> you're<00:01:55.509> gonna<00:01:55.570> do

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
is now yes and then what you're gonna do

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:57.109 
is now yes and then what you're gonna do
is<00:01:55.750> you<00:01:55.840> know<00:01:55.929> just<00:01:56.229> kind<00:01:56.439> of<00:01:56.470> rinse<00:01:56.710> it<00:01:56.799> off

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
is you know just kind of rinse it off

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.870 
is you know just kind of rinse it off
you<00:01:58.119> can<00:01:58.240> slip<00:01:58.479> it<00:01:58.630> on<00:01:58.720> your<00:01:58.750> mandrel<00:01:59.259> and<00:01:59.880> you

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
you can slip it on your mandrel and you

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.190 
you can slip it on your mandrel and you
can<00:02:01.000> see<00:02:01.149> it<00:02:01.270> went<00:02:01.420> all<00:02:01.509> the<00:02:01.539> way<00:02:01.659> down<00:02:01.869> so

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
can see it went all the way down so

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.200 
can see it went all the way down so
that's<00:02:02.320> too<00:02:02.470> big<00:02:02.590> okay<00:02:03.520> so<00:02:03.729> we're<00:02:04.000> going<00:02:04.090> to

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
that's too big okay so we're going to

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.179 
that's too big okay so we're going to
just<00:02:04.390> take<00:02:04.570> out<00:02:04.750> little<00:02:04.990> chunks<00:02:05.409> and<00:02:05.890> keep

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
just take out little chunks and keep

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.070 
just take out little chunks and keep
doing<00:02:06.340> that<00:02:06.460> process<00:02:06.940> until<00:02:07.240> it<00:02:07.360> fits<00:02:07.569> around

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
doing that process until it fits around

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.729 
doing that process until it fits around
that<00:02:08.319> disk

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
that disk

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:09.840 
that disk
all<00:02:08.799> right<00:02:08.979> and<00:02:09.160> can<00:02:09.280> you<00:02:09.369> reserve<00:02:09.640> the

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
all right and can you reserve the

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.240 
all right and can you reserve the
argenteum<00:02:10.299> and<00:02:10.539> use<00:02:10.660> it<00:02:10.840> again<00:02:11.230> oh<00:02:11.500> yeah<00:02:11.920> and

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
argenteum and use it again oh yeah and

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.620 
argenteum and use it again oh yeah and
you<00:02:12.700> can<00:02:12.819> use<00:02:12.940> all<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.150> little<00:02:13.360> bits<00:02:13.450> and

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
you can use all the little bits and

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.210 
you can use all the little bits and
pieces<00:02:13.690> of<00:02:13.959> decoration<00:02:14.560> on<00:02:14.680> something<00:02:15.040> else

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
pieces of decoration on something else

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.300 
pieces of decoration on something else
okay<00:02:15.569> but<00:02:16.569> I<00:02:16.600> do<00:02:16.690> have<00:02:16.930> one<00:02:17.080> here<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.319> fits<00:02:17.560> me

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
okay but I do have one here the fits me

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.120 
okay but I do have one here the fits me
and<00:02:18.489> it<00:02:18.549> fits<00:02:18.790> all<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.120> way<00:02:19.209> around<00:02:19.450> my<00:02:19.540> desk

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
and it fits all the way around my desk

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.870 
and it fits all the way around my desk
so<00:02:21.130> we're<00:02:21.220> just<00:02:21.250> going<00:02:21.430> to<00:02:21.489> push<00:02:21.670> that<00:02:21.819> down

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
so we're just going to push that down

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.910 
so we're just going to push that down
you<00:02:22.180> got<00:02:22.330> to<00:02:22.450> have<00:02:22.569> contact<00:02:23.110> for<00:02:23.410> it<00:02:23.500> to<00:02:23.650> fuse

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
you got to have contact for it to fuse

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.509 
you got to have contact for it to fuse
any<00:02:24.730> kind<00:02:24.970> of<00:02:25.030> gaps<00:02:25.209> it's<00:02:25.510> not<00:02:25.690> going<00:02:25.840> to<00:02:25.900> fill

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
any kind of gaps it's not going to fill

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.130 
any kind of gaps it's not going to fill
okay<00:02:27.519> all<00:02:28.000> right<00:02:28.180> so<00:02:28.510> I'm<00:02:28.630> just<00:02:28.750> gonna<00:02:28.840> push

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
okay all right so I'm just gonna push

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.410 
okay all right so I'm just gonna push
that<00:02:29.260> down<00:02:29.410> really<00:02:29.890> good<00:02:30.060> would<00:02:31.060> you<00:02:31.150> want<00:02:31.299> it

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
that down really good would you want it

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.570 
that down really good would you want it
would<00:02:31.660> you<00:02:31.750> ever<00:02:31.840> hammer<00:02:32.080> this<00:02:32.319> hammer<00:02:33.310> the

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
would you ever hammer this hammer the

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.059 
would you ever hammer this hammer the
ring<00:02:33.910> down<00:02:34.120> on<00:02:34.390> top<00:02:34.599> of<00:02:34.750> that<00:02:34.870> no<00:02:35.500> just<00:02:35.799> push<00:02:35.950> it

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
ring down on top of that no just push it

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.620 
ring down on top of that no just push it
real<00:02:36.190> firmly<00:02:36.459> when<00:02:37.150> you<00:02:37.209> start<00:02:37.420> hammering

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
real firmly when you start hammering

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.090 
real firmly when you start hammering
you're<00:02:37.930> gonna<00:02:38.019> change<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.560> dimensions<00:02:38.980> of

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
you're gonna change the dimensions of

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.740 
you're gonna change the dimensions of
the<00:02:39.220> ring<00:02:39.400> all<00:02:39.609> right<00:02:39.850> and<00:02:40.239> you<00:02:40.329> don't<00:02:40.450> want<00:02:40.660> to

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
the ring all right and you don't want to

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.030 
the ring all right and you don't want to
do<00:02:40.840> that<00:02:40.989> and<00:02:41.109> you're<00:02:41.230> working<00:02:41.350> on<00:02:41.590> a<00:02:41.650> carbon

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
do that and you're working on a carbon

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.470 
do that and you're working on a carbon
block<00:02:42.130> carbon<00:02:42.730> block<00:02:42.910> that's<00:02:43.180> going<00:02:43.299> to<00:02:43.359> help

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
block carbon block that's going to help

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.960 
block carbon block that's going to help
keep<00:02:43.600> the<00:02:43.870> oxygen<00:02:44.320> away<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:45.730> allow<00:02:45.910> that

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
keep the oxygen away and allow that

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.110 
keep the oxygen away and allow that
metal<00:02:46.480> to<00:02:46.600> diffuse<00:02:47.170> okay<00:02:47.820> there<00:02:48.820> again<00:02:49.030> I'm

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
metal to diffuse okay there again I'm

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.559 
metal to diffuse okay there again I'm
using<00:02:49.239> a<00:02:49.620> yellow<00:02:50.620> flux<00:02:51.040> this<00:02:51.940> will<00:02:52.180> help<00:02:52.390> keep

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
using a yellow flux this will help keep

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.130 
using a yellow flux this will help keep
the<00:02:53.069> oxygen<00:02:54.069> away<00:02:54.660> and<00:02:55.660> you<00:02:55.780> want<00:02:55.870> it<00:02:55.989> to<00:02:56.019> go

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
the oxygen away and you want it to go

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.280 
the oxygen away and you want it to go
all<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.290> way<00:02:56.350> around<00:02:56.819> and<00:02:57.819> dishonor<00:02:58.780> this<00:02:59.019> is

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
all the way around and dishonor this is

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.710 
all the way around and dishonor this is
a<00:02:59.530> lot<00:02:59.950> harder<00:03:00.000> okay<00:03:01.030> people<00:03:01.359> think<00:03:01.540> you<00:03:01.630> know

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
a lot harder okay people think you know

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.420 
a lot harder okay people think you know
fusing<00:03:02.049> is<00:03:02.140> really<00:03:02.440> really<00:03:02.620> hard<00:03:02.829> it<00:03:03.069> only

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
fusing is really really hard it only

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.030 
fusing is really really hard it only
takes<00:03:03.639> an<00:03:03.760> advanced<00:03:04.120> person<00:03:04.600> seems<00:03:04.780> so<00:03:04.959> easy

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
takes an advanced person seems so easy

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.470 
takes an advanced person seems so easy
in<00:03:06.040> a<00:03:06.130> lot<00:03:06.280> of<00:03:06.310> ways<00:03:06.519> it's<00:03:06.670> a<00:03:06.760> lot<00:03:06.970> easier<00:03:07.329> than

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
in a lot of ways it's a lot easier than

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.720 
in a lot of ways it's a lot easier than
soldering

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.060 

I've<00:03:11.730> actually<00:03:11.880> melted<00:03:12.390> fewer<00:03:12.780> things<00:03:13.080> fusing

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
I've actually melted fewer things fusing

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.130 
I've actually melted fewer things fusing
then<00:03:14.910> I<00:03:15.030> have<00:03:15.240> actually<00:03:15.660> trying<00:03:15.810> to<00:03:15.900> put<00:03:16.050> the

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
then I have actually trying to put the

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.510 
then I have actually trying to put the
solder<00:03:16.380> because<00:03:16.620> when<00:03:16.830> you<00:03:16.920> put<00:03:17.070> solder<00:03:17.310> down

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
solder because when you put solder down

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.980 
solder because when you put solder down
you're<00:03:18.120> trying<00:03:18.330> to<00:03:18.390> get<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.630> flow<00:03:19.730> with<00:03:20.730> the

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990 
you're trying to get the flow with the

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.210 
you're trying to get the flow with the
fusing<00:03:21.990> of<00:03:22.050> the<00:03:22.140> argenteum<00:03:22.740> or<00:03:22.890> any<00:03:23.010> other

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
fusing of the argenteum or any other

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.840 
fusing of the argenteum or any other
metal<00:03:23.430> it's<00:03:24.000> it's<00:03:24.210> a<00:03:24.330> set<00:03:24.600> point<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.850> it

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
metal it's it's a set point and it

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:27.980 
metal it's it's a set point and it
happens<00:03:27.150> very<00:03:27.270> very<00:03:27.480> quickly

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
happens very very quickly

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.250 
happens very very quickly
and<00:03:28.320> how<00:03:28.500> do<00:03:28.560> you<00:03:28.620> know<00:03:28.710> that<00:03:28.830> it's<00:03:29.070> fused<00:03:30.260> some

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
and how do you know that it's fused some

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.760 
and how do you know that it's fused some
tase's<00:03:31.440> you<00:03:31.740> guess<00:03:31.950> you<00:03:32.790> know<00:03:32.960> right<00:03:33.960> like

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
tase's you guess you know right like

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.050 
tase's you guess you know right like
we're<00:03:34.980> here<00:03:35.130> we'd<00:03:35.310> get<00:03:35.490> into<00:03:35.580> the<00:03:35.700> right<00:03:35.820> color

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
we're here we'd get into the right color

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.200 
we're here we'd get into the right color
a<00:03:37.010> little<00:03:38.010> bit<00:03:38.130> of<00:03:38.220> experience<00:03:38.580> comes<00:03:39.000> in

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.210 
a little bit of experience comes in

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.270 
a little bit of experience comes in
there<00:03:39.390> you're<00:03:40.080> gonna<00:03:40.140> melt<00:03:40.410> a<00:03:40.500> few<00:03:40.710> things

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.730 

okay<00:03:44.450> so<00:03:45.450> I<00:03:45.510> think<00:03:45.570> I<00:03:45.810> got<00:03:45.990> that<00:03:46.170> so<00:03:46.590> let's

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
okay so I think I got that so let's

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.190 
okay so I think I got that so let's
check<00:03:46.890> it<00:03:46.920> out<00:03:47.130> okay<00:03:48.000> you<00:03:48.690> want<00:03:48.840> to<00:03:48.870> touch<00:03:49.020> with

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
check it out okay you want to touch with

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.810 
check it out okay you want to touch with
your<00:03:49.320> tweezers<00:03:49.500> is<00:03:49.890> it<00:03:50.070> still<00:03:50.280> hot<00:03:50.430> at<00:03:50.670> this

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
your tweezers is it still hot at this

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.310 
your tweezers is it still hot at this
point<00:03:51.090> right<00:03:51.510> but<00:03:51.690> I<00:03:51.720> did<00:03:51.870> let<00:03:52.020> it<00:03:52.110> cool<00:03:52.260> a

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
point right but I did let it cool a

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.220 
point right but I did let it cool a
little<00:03:52.380> bit<00:03:52.740> if<00:03:53.100> you<00:03:53.160> touch<00:03:53.700> it<00:03:53.730> too<00:03:54.030> fast<00:03:54.240> it

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
little bit if you touch it too fast it

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.350 
little bit if you touch it too fast it
could<00:03:55.380> crack<00:03:55.650> okay<00:03:56.640> so<00:03:56.700> you<00:03:56.850> let<00:03:57.060> it<00:03:57.180> cool<00:03:57.300> a

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
could crack okay so you let it cool a

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.390 
could crack okay so you let it cool a
little<00:03:57.420> then<00:03:57.810> quench<00:03:58.140> now<00:03:59.040> I<00:03:59.070> need<00:03:59.220> to<00:03:59.280> make<00:03:59.340> a

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
little then quench now I need to make a

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.030 
little then quench now I need to make a
dome<00:03:59.960> so<00:04:00.960> I'm<00:04:01.020> just<00:04:01.170> gonna<00:04:01.260> put<00:04:01.530> it<00:04:01.620> in<00:04:01.710> my<00:04:01.740> dad

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
dome so I'm just gonna put it in my dad

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.940 
dome so I'm just gonna put it in my dad
set<00:04:02.610> here<00:04:03.710> and<00:04:04.710> take<00:04:05.100> it<00:04:05.220> down<00:04:05.370> to<00:04:05.550> a<00:04:05.580> dome<00:04:05.820> and

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
set here and take it down to a dome and

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.960 
set here and take it down to a dome and
I'll<00:04:07.950> work<00:04:08.160> it<00:04:08.310> down<00:04:09.260> to<00:04:10.260> a<00:04:10.290> size<00:04:11.220> DAP<00:04:11.700> that's

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
I'll work it down to a size DAP that's

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.450 
I'll work it down to a size DAP that's
the<00:04:12.060> same<00:04:12.300> size<00:04:12.510> as<00:04:12.690> my<00:04:12.870> bead<00:04:13.130> so<00:04:14.130> I'll<00:04:14.280> keep

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
the same size as my bead so I'll keep

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.030 
the same size as my bead so I'll keep
going<00:04:14.610> down<00:04:14.850> to<00:04:15.000> the<00:04:15.090> same<00:04:15.270> size<00:04:15.540> until<00:04:16.470> so<00:04:16.980> you

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
going down to the same size until so you

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.490 
going down to the same size until so you
keep<00:04:17.220> doming<00:04:17.640> and<00:04:17.790> doming<00:04:18.150> mm-hmm<00:04:18.690> until<00:04:19.410> you

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
keep doming and doming mm-hmm until you

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.390 
keep doming and doming mm-hmm until you
get<00:04:19.620> the<00:04:19.739> size<00:04:19.890> that<00:04:20.100> you<00:04:20.220> need

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
get the size that you need

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.979 
get the size that you need
okay<00:04:20.940> and<00:04:21.359> the<00:04:21.450> next<00:04:21.510> step<00:04:21.810> is<00:04:21.840> pretty

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
okay and the next step is pretty

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.050 
okay and the next step is pretty
critical<00:04:22.200> you<00:04:23.040> do<00:04:23.190> have<00:04:23.370> to<00:04:23.610> clean<00:04:24.030> that

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
critical you do have to clean that

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.990 
critical you do have to clean that
surface<00:04:24.390> or<00:04:24.810> nothing<00:04:25.050> else<00:04:25.110> will<00:04:25.320> fuse<00:04:25.560> to<00:04:25.710> it

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
surface or nothing else will fuse to it

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.040 
surface or nothing else will fuse to it
so<00:04:27.000> just<00:04:27.630> take<00:04:27.750> a<00:04:27.780> radial<00:04:28.170> bristle<00:04:28.470> disc<00:04:30.050> the

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
so just take a radial bristle disc the

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.620 
so just take a radial bristle disc the
blue<00:04:31.200> ones<00:04:31.350> good<00:04:31.560> it's<00:04:31.860> about<00:04:31.950> 400<00:04:32.250> grit<00:04:32.700> he's

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
blue ones good it's about 400 grit he's

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.290 
blue ones good it's about 400 grit he's
a<00:04:33.660> nice<00:04:33.960> finish<00:04:34.440> and<00:04:34.740> he's<00:04:35.550> gonna<00:04:35.730> scrub<00:04:36.150> the

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
a nice finish and he's gonna scrub the

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.520 
a nice finish and he's gonna scrub the
surface<00:04:36.480> make<00:04:36.840> it<00:04:36.960> ultra<00:04:37.080> clean

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.869 

and<00:04:41.530> once<00:04:41.710> you<00:04:41.800> do<00:04:41.949> that<00:04:42.129> now<00:04:42.370> we<00:04:42.430> get<00:04:42.580> add<00:04:42.729> to

00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:42.879 
and once you do that now we get add to

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:45.629 
and once you do that now we get add to
embellishment<00:04:43.539> right<00:04:43.569> right<00:04:44.229> so<00:04:44.830> I<00:04:45.189> got<00:04:45.460> some

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
embellishment right right so I got some

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.209 
embellishment right right so I got some
pre-made<00:04:45.969> Bella<00:04:46.240> Schmidt<00:04:46.569> I<00:04:46.810> took<00:04:47.560> a<00:04:47.590> thin

sheet at 26 gauge and cut out some

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:53.399 
sheet at 26 gauge and cut out some
little<00:04:51.009> punches<00:04:51.849> with<00:04:52.029> the<00:04:52.060> hole<00:04:52.270> punch<00:04:52.509> tiny

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:53.409 
little punches with the hole punch tiny

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:54.659 
little punches with the hole punch tiny
punch<00:04:53.889> is<00:04:54.039> very<00:04:54.279> tiny

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
punch is very tiny

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.330 
punch is very tiny
this<00:04:55.120> parts<00:04:55.389> gonna<00:04:55.569> take<00:04:55.749> some<00:04:55.930> patience<00:04:56.340> but

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
this parts gonna take some patience but

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.170 
this parts gonna take some patience but
what<00:04:57.520> you<00:04:57.610> can<00:04:57.759> do<00:04:57.849> is<00:04:57.939> just<00:04:58.060> take<00:04:58.240> it<00:04:58.449> and<00:05:00.180> the

what you can do is just take it and the

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.739 
what you can do is just take it and the
flux<00:05:01.539> will<00:05:01.749> act<00:05:02.189> as<00:05:03.189> like<00:05:03.370> a<00:05:03.430> glue<00:05:03.699> almost<00:05:04.120> all

00:05:04.739 --> 00:05:04.749 
flux will act as like a glue almost all

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:06.119 
flux will act as like a glue almost all
right<00:05:04.870> and<00:05:05.050> you<00:05:05.139> can<00:05:05.289> place<00:05:05.499> your<00:05:05.529> it<00:05:05.800> holds<00:05:06.039> it

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.540 
take it up to the next level with a rope
around<00:05:16.900> the<00:05:17.139> end<00:05:17.289> you<00:05:17.830> do<00:05:17.949> have<00:05:18.129> one<00:05:18.310> level

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
around the end you do have one level

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.610 
around the end you do have one level
that<00:05:18.729> you<00:05:18.789> could<00:05:18.879> stop<00:05:19.150> at<00:05:19.360> and<00:05:19.930> you<00:05:20.289> can<00:05:20.409> stop

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
that you could stop at and you can stop

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.260 
that you could stop at and you can stop
anywhere<00:05:20.949> really<00:05:21.159> right<00:05:21.699> so<00:05:22.120> you're<00:05:22.210> gonna

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
anywhere really right so you're gonna

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.360 
anywhere really right so you're gonna
add<00:05:22.509> your<00:05:22.659> embellishment<00:05:23.259> until<00:05:24.099> you<00:05:24.189> get

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
add your embellishment until you get

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.170 
add your embellishment until you get
something<00:05:26.099> then<00:05:27.099> get<00:05:27.219> this<00:05:27.400> off<00:05:27.580> without<00:05:27.759> man

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
something then get this off without man

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.809 
something then get this off without man
as<00:05:28.330> you<00:05:28.449> do<00:05:29.129> so<00:05:30.129> this<00:05:30.250> is<00:05:30.310> one<00:05:30.580> that<00:05:30.699> you've

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:30.819 
as you do so this is one that you've

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:33.360 
as you do so this is one that you've
already<00:05:30.969> added<00:05:31.300> little<00:05:31.539> dots<00:05:31.810> to<00:05:32.139> right<00:05:32.680> and

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
already added little dots to right and

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.850 
already added little dots to right and
it's<00:05:33.580> dried<00:05:33.849> because<00:05:34.779> the<00:05:34.930> next<00:05:35.169> step<00:05:35.349> here<00:05:35.710> is

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
it's dried because the next step here is

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.890 
it's dried because the next step here is
you<00:05:36.099> gotta<00:05:36.279> let<00:05:36.430> that<00:05:36.550> dry<00:05:36.819> how<00:05:37.569> long<00:05:37.719> does<00:05:37.839> it

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
you gotta let that dry how long does it

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.140 
you gotta let that dry how long does it
take<00:05:38.139> to<00:05:38.259> dry<00:05:38.490> could<00:05:39.490> take<00:05:39.639> anywhere<00:05:39.849> from<00:05:39.909> 30

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
take to dry could take anywhere from 30

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.249 
take to dry could take anywhere from 30
minutes<00:05:40.240> a<00:05:40.509> couple<00:05:40.629> of<00:05:40.810> hours<00:05:40.990> when<00:05:41.169> you're

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:41.259 
minutes a couple of hours when you're

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:42.809 
minutes a couple of hours when you're
put<00:05:41.439> just<00:05:41.650> putting<00:05:41.860> it<00:05:41.949> on<00:05:42.039> the<00:05:42.099> hot<00:05:42.339> plate<00:05:42.370> to

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:42.819 
put just putting it on the hot plate to

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:45.240 
put just putting it on the hot plate to
dry<00:05:43.029> right<00:05:43.419> exactly<00:05:43.930> the<00:05:44.589> reason<00:05:44.860> for<00:05:44.949> that<00:05:45.009> is

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
dry right exactly the reason for that is

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.890 
dry right exactly the reason for that is
when<00:05:45.400> I<00:05:45.430> go<00:05:45.580> to<00:05:45.639> heat<00:05:45.849> this<00:05:45.969> up<00:05:46.180> and<00:05:46.330> no<00:05:46.449> flux

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
when I go to heat this up and no flux

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.959 
when I go to heat this up and no flux
was<00:05:47.050> wet<00:05:47.229> and<00:05:48.039> start<00:05:48.400> to<00:05:48.460> bubble<00:05:48.639> and<00:05:48.819> those

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:48.969 
was wet and start to bubble and those

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:50.369 
was wet and start to bubble and those
things<00:05:49.120> would<00:05:49.270> just<00:05:49.389> lift<00:05:49.659> right<00:05:49.960> off<00:05:49.990> okay

00:05:50.369 --> 00:05:50.379 
things would just lift right off okay

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:52.200 
things would just lift right off okay
anything<00:05:51.219> they<00:05:51.400> all<00:05:51.520> move<00:05:51.699> around<00:05:51.789> and<00:05:52.150> you

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
anything they all move around and you

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.640 
anything they all move around and you
gotta<00:05:52.360> chase<00:05:52.539> him<00:05:52.689> around<00:05:52.779> all<00:05:53.289> right<00:05:53.379> we

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
gotta chase him around all right we

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.869 
gotta chase him around all right we
don't<00:05:53.740> want<00:05:53.830> to<00:05:53.979> do<00:05:54.069> that<00:05:54.250> no<00:05:55.500> so<00:05:56.669> what<00:05:57.669> you<00:05:57.759> can

around the bead a little bit so you may

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.360 
around the bead a little bit so you may
have<00:06:02.680> to<00:06:02.830> turn<00:06:03.039> the<00:06:03.189> block<00:06:03.779> and<00:06:04.779> make<00:06:05.020> sure<00:06:05.370> but

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
have to turn the block and make sure but

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:07.379 
have to turn the block and make sure but
notice<00:06:06.610> where<00:06:06.699> I'm<00:06:06.789> putting<00:06:06.939> the<00:06:07.089> tip<00:06:07.270> of<00:06:07.360> that

start turning and now that Mel's all
glossy<00:06:16.920> we're<00:06:17.920> about<00:06:18.070> fusing<00:06:18.580> we<00:06:18.970> refusing

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 
glossy we're about fusing we refusing

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.660 
glossy we're about fusing we refusing
right<00:06:19.540> now<00:06:19.860> and<00:06:20.860> we<00:06:21.010> just<00:06:21.190> got<00:06:21.310> to<00:06:21.400> be<00:06:21.460> really

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:21.670 
right now and we just got to be really

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:23.670 
right now and we just got to be really
careful<00:06:22.120> not<00:06:22.150> to<00:06:22.390> go<00:06:22.510> any<00:06:22.660> further<00:06:22.840> we<00:06:23.470> want<00:06:23.560> to

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
careful not to go any further we want to

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.320 
careful not to go any further we want to
make<00:06:23.800> sure<00:06:23.830> I<00:06:24.010> think<00:06:24.130> it's<00:06:24.550> you<00:06:24.880> know<00:06:24.910> good

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.330 
make sure I think it's you know good

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.130 
make sure I think it's you know good
infused<00:06:26.430> so<00:06:27.430> this<00:06:27.640> really<00:06:27.820> tacked<00:06:28.180> down<00:06:28.270> more

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:29.140 
infused so this really tacked down more

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.630 
infused so this really tacked down more
than<00:06:29.170> tacked<00:06:29.500> down<00:06:29.590> so<00:06:30.160> it's<00:06:30.310> all<00:06:30.460> the<00:06:30.550> way

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:30.640 
than tacked down so it's all the way

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.490 
than tacked down so it's all the way
down<00:06:30.850> because<00:06:31.480> what'll<00:06:31.750> happen<00:06:31.960> is<00:06:32.230> you<00:06:32.380> know

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.500 
down because what'll happen is you know

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.750 
down because what'll happen is you know
we'll<00:06:32.650> get<00:06:32.770> done<00:06:32.950> we<00:06:33.130> were<00:06:33.190> like<00:06:33.310> that<00:06:33.670> was

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:33.760 
we'll get done we were like that was

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.640 
we'll get done we were like that was
cool<00:06:33.940> I<00:06:33.970> got<00:06:34.210> all<00:06:34.420> that<00:06:34.600> and<00:06:34.840> then<00:06:35.260> one<00:06:35.530> little

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 
cool I got all that and then one little

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.590 
cool I got all that and then one little
dot<00:06:35.890> will<00:06:36.100> pop<00:06:36.250> off<00:06:36.460> so<00:06:36.850> you<00:06:37.300> want<00:06:37.450> to<00:06:37.510> make

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:37.600 
dot will pop off so you want to make

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.090 
dot will pop off so you want to make
sure<00:06:37.780> they're<00:06:37.930> all<00:06:38.110> completely<00:06:38.710> on<00:06:38.920> there

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:39.100 
sure they're all completely on there

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.290 
sure they're all completely on there
right<00:06:39.460> so<00:06:41.100> we're<00:06:42.100> let<00:06:42.400> it<00:06:42.490> cool<00:06:42.640> just<00:06:42.940> a<00:06:43.060> little

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300 
right so we're let it cool just a little

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.600 
right so we're let it cool just a little
bit<00:06:43.450> and<00:06:44.290> we'll<00:06:44.410> go<00:06:44.560> ahead<00:06:44.650> and<00:06:44.980> dump<00:06:45.370> it<00:06:45.520> in

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:45.610 
bit and we'll go ahead and dump it in

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:47.880 
bit and we'll go ahead and dump it in
some<00:06:45.760> more<00:06:45.850> water<00:06:46.320> and<00:06:47.320> now<00:06:47.440> what<00:06:47.620> I<00:06:47.650> do<00:06:47.740> is

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:47.890 
some more water and now what I do is

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.490
