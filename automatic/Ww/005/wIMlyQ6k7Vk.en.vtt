00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
starting to foam up a little bit and we

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.340 
starting to foam up a little bit and we
just<00:00:47.160> want<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.399> mix<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.789> just<00:00:48.120> for<00:00:48.360> just<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.140> few

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
just want to mix it just for just a few

00:00:49.350 --> 00:01:00.110 
just want to mix it just for just a few
few<00:00:49.860> more<00:00:50.039> seconds<00:00:58.370> okay<00:00:59.370> if<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.640> see<00:00:59.910> that

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
few more seconds okay if you see that

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.920 
few more seconds okay if you see that
it's<00:01:00.270> not<00:01:00.420> getting<00:01:00.780> frothy<00:01:01.680> enough<00:01:02.520> and

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
it's not getting frothy enough and

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.240 
it's not getting frothy enough and
typically<00:01:03.930> if<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.170> have<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.439> saucepan<00:01:04.979> about

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
typically if you have a saucepan about

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.929 
typically if you have a saucepan about
this<00:01:05.489> size<00:01:05.729> it's<00:01:06.600> going<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.460> come<00:01:08.460> up<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.760> about

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
this size it's going to come up to about

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.109 
this size it's going to come up to about
maybe<00:01:09.090> two<00:01:09.390> inches<00:01:09.570> below<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.200> rim<00:01:10.820> so<00:01:11.820> our

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
maybe two inches below the rim so our

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.780 
maybe two inches below the rim so our
mixture<00:01:12.630> now<00:01:12.750> our<00:01:13.170> caramel<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.860> ready<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.670> go

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
popcorn and the pecans you're not going

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.819 
popcorn and the pecans you're not going
to<00:02:24.110> get<00:02:24.230> everything<00:02:24.650> coated<00:02:25.510> initially<00:02:26.829> what

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:27.829 
to get everything coated initially what

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:30.580 
to get everything coated initially what
we'll<00:02:27.980> do<00:02:28.160> then<00:02:28.190> is<00:02:28.519> place<00:02:28.819> this<00:02:29.410> popcorn<00:02:30.410> in

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
we'll do then is place this popcorn in

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.729 
we'll do then is place this popcorn in
the<00:02:30.620> oven<00:02:31.069> and<00:02:31.660> that<00:02:32.660> will<00:02:32.840> allow<00:02:33.079> the<00:02:33.140> caramel

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
the oven and that will allow the caramel

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.110 
the oven and that will allow the caramel
to<00:02:33.860> continue<00:02:34.310> to<00:02:34.459> melt<00:02:34.730> and<00:02:35.090> then<00:02:35.989> we<00:02:36.170> will<00:02:37.120> mix

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
to continue to melt and then we will mix

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.680 
to continue to melt and then we will mix
it<00:02:38.390> a<00:02:38.599> couple<00:02:39.410> times<00:02:39.560> while<00:02:40.069> it's<00:02:40.280> in<00:02:40.430> the

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
it a couple times while it's in the

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.970 
it a couple times while it's in the
while<00:02:41.690> it's<00:02:41.870> cooking<00:02:42.170> and<00:02:42.470> baking<00:02:42.680> in<00:02:42.950> the

while it's cooking and baking in the
oven<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:45.069> then<00:02:47.049> the<00:02:48.049> coating<00:02:48.910> will<00:02:49.910> be<00:02:50.030> pretty

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
oven and then the coating will be pretty

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.890 
oven and then the coating will be pretty
much<00:02:50.510> well<00:02:51.019> over<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.379> popcorn<00:02:52.360> okay<00:02:53.360> well<00:02:53.870> I

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
much well over the popcorn okay well I

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.869 
much well over the popcorn okay well I

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
you want to make sure though that you

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.150 
you want to make sure though that you
separate<00:03:38.959> that<00:03:39.019> popcorn<00:03:39.799> and<00:03:39.980> keep

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
separating it and you'll notice that it

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.670 
separating it and you'll notice that it

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
gets this nice crunchy texture and that

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.530 
gets this nice crunchy texture and that
is<00:03:46.010> due<00:03:46.250> to<00:03:46.489> the<00:03:46.519> cream<00:03:46.790> of<00:03:46.819> tartar<00:03:47.299> that<00:03:47.450> you

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
is due to the cream of tartar that you

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.599 
is due to the cream of tartar that you
place<00:03:47.930> into<00:03:48.410> the<00:03:48.530> mixture<00:03:48.829> that<00:03:49.220> adds<00:03:49.430> that

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
place into the mixture that adds that

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:50.949 
place into the mixture that adds that
crispiness<00:03:50.090> so<00:03:50.389> if<00:03:50.450> you'd<00:03:50.569> want<00:03:50.780> a<00:03:50.840> little
