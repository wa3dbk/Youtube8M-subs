believe or yeah he might yeah obviously

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.170 
believe or yeah he might yeah obviously
he<00:01:09.479> is<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.780> default<00:01:10.170> striker<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.880> so<00:01:11.880> basically

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
he is a default striker and so basically

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.580

research in my right ear 23 kitchen yeah

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.280 
research in my right ear 23 kitchen yeah
while<00:03:36.320> 323<00:03:37.100> k<00:03:37.250> 6<00:03:37.670> 7<00:03:37.880> 10<00:03:38.030> for<00:03:38.330> 20k<00:03:38.600> pick<00:03:39.049> him<00:03:39.200> up

while 323 k 6 7 10 for 20k pick him up
some<00:03:39.620> straight<00:03:39.950> away<00:03:40.130> that<00:03:40.340> would<00:03:40.760> be<00:03:40.880> a<00:03:40.910> good

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
some straight away that would be a good

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.199 
some straight away that would be a good
deal<00:03:41.810> but<00:03:42.500> basically<00:03:42.680> it<00:03:43.010> there<00:03:43.640> with<00:03:43.850> so<00:03:43.880> many

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
deal but basically it there with so many

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:45.759 
deal but basically it there with so many
cards<00:03:44.570> you<00:03:44.600> can<00:03:44.750> do<00:03:44.930> this<00:03:45.049> with<00:03:45.110> so<00:03:45.440> many<00:03:45.560> cars

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
cards you can do this with so many cars

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.890 
cards you can do this with so many cars
for<00:03:45.920> example<00:03:46.190> for<00:03:46.400> cows<00:03:46.700> well<00:03:47.060> you<00:03:47.480> can<00:03:47.630> do<00:03:47.750> it

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
for example for cows well you can do it

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.330 
for example for cows well you can do it
with<00:03:48.140> him<00:03:48.320> as<00:03:48.530> well<00:03:48.620> you<00:03:48.739> can<00:03:48.860> do<00:03:48.950> it<00:03:49.040> basically

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
with him as well you can do it basically

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.330 
with him as well you can do it basically
with<00:03:49.549> anyone<00:03:49.850> that's<00:03:50.330> can<00:03:50.480> see<00:03:50.630> a<00:03:50.660> for<00:03:50.780> example

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
with anyone that's can see a for example

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.910 
with anyone that's can see a for example
7470<00:03:52.340> 64k<00:03:53.299> open<00:03:54.080> bit<00:03:54.230> there<00:03:54.440> but<00:03:54.650> as<00:03:54.769> you<00:03:54.860> can

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
7470 64k open bit there but as you can

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.449 
7470 64k open bit there but as you can
see<00:03:55.070> does<00:03:55.280> indeed<00:03:55.610> have<00:03:55.640> a<00:03:55.820> 75<00:03:56.269> k<00:03:56.480> by<00:03:56.720> now<00:03:57.410> 68<00:03:58.220> k

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
see does indeed have a 75 k by now 68 k

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.220 
see does indeed have a 75 k by now 68 k
so<00:03:58.700> you<00:03:58.790> can<00:03:59.000> basically<00:03:59.330> picked<00:03:59.750> out<00:03:59.900> try<00:04:00.170> to

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
so you can basically picked out try to

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.750 
so you can basically picked out try to
pick<00:04:00.410> that<00:04:00.500> one<00:04:00.650> up<00:04:00.680> and<00:04:00.980> sell<00:04:01.430> it<00:04:01.459> for<00:04:01.580> a

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
pick that one up and sell it for a

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.250 
pick that one up and sell it for a
little<00:04:02.150> bit<00:04:02.269> more<00:04:02.540> which<00:04:02.690> would<00:04:02.720> bring<00:04:03.110> me

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
little bit more which would bring me

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.470 
little bit more which would bring me
