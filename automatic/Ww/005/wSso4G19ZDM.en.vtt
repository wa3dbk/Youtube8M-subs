00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.520
 You can see that her hair is 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.520
 they have the front pulled 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.260
 separate the hair to fringe making the 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.260
 triangle as you've seen 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:54.020
 separate the wicks from the front of the 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:56.180
 head as is a lot of 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.220
 hair and eyelash will divide into three 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.390
 parts to make it easier to 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.280
 work a high division an average and 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.130
 another low 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.410
 make a division from ear to ear as 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.930
 You already did for the luca cuts. 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:15.670
 beat without splitting in the middle 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.670
 hold your hair high 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.509
 a wick here in the center of the 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.210
 hair in the lower part 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.649
 bring this wick up with your fingers 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.380
 vertically 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:35.990
 take as a reference the low end 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:40.539
 which is the size that the hair is already 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.539
 will not be cut cut 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.590
 release the median wick and repeat the 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:57.470
 process taking the wick from below and 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.470
 Measuring what's left you cut 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:26.200
 the cut back until it reaches the side 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.970
 as you cut the fuses 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:56.110
 higher 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:58.180
 also raise the wick to cut go 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.500
 always checking to avoid running the 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.570
 risk of cutting too much or less 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.700
 measure the corresponding wicks of 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.060
 each side to see if they are the same 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.060
 size 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.810
 in this case join the front with the 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.530
 back and make a shredder from the 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.530
 chin height 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.260
 O 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:19.940
 this cutting technique is the only way 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.510
 to make the fringe becomes gradient 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.190
 and turn around 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.790
 separate a wick that will guide and 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.650
 cut to desired height 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:33.830
 join the wick with the rest of the 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:37.720
 fringe hair and pull forward 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:47.360
 holding between the fingers on the diagonal 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:50.419
 then combed up and with the 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:56.870
 straight fingers cut the tips again 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:59.650
 that are left over and so you have the 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.650
 cut soon
