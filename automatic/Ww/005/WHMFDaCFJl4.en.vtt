further<00:00:14.280> I'm<00:00:15.030> considering<00:00:15.900> that<00:00:16.020> this<00:00:16.139> is

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
further I'm considering that this is

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.260 
further I'm considering that this is
possibly<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.890> dark<00:00:17.250> side<00:00:17.490> Mordecai<00:00:18.029> let's

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
at Hobby Co and 10 but at least I got a

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.810 
at Hobby Co and 10 but at least I got a
pretty<00:00:40.020> good<00:00:40.200> range<00:00:40.410> there<00:00:40.710> but<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.250> closer<00:00:41.790> I

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
pretty good range there but the closer I

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.080 
pretty good range there but the closer I
looked<00:00:42.180> at<00:00:42.420> this<00:00:42.660> Mordecai<00:00:43.879> the<00:00:44.879> more

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
looked at this Mordecai the more

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.709 
looked at this Mordecai the more
disgusted<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.170> was<00:00:46.440> with<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:47.610> figure<00:00:47.969> it's

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
disgusted I was with this figure it's

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.470 
disgusted I was with this figure it's
actually<00:00:49.110> painted<00:00:49.950> really<00:00:50.550> really<00:00:50.789> poorly

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
actually painted really really poorly

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.119 
actually painted really really poorly
and<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:51.750> was<00:00:52.170> actually<00:00:52.320> thinking<00:00:52.469> maybe<00:00:52.829> this

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
and I was actually thinking maybe this

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.740 
and I was actually thinking maybe this
is<00:00:53.250> like<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.430> dark<00:00:53.820> side<00:00:54.120> but<00:00:54.270> that's<00:00:54.420> sort<00:00:54.629> of

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
is like a dark side but that's sort of

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.770 
is like a dark side but that's sort of
snuck<00:00:55.020> into<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.760> the<00:00:56.760> real<00:00:56.940> toy<00:00:57.149> part<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.629> mean

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
snuck into the the real toy part I mean

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.020 
snuck into the the real toy part I mean
you<00:00:57.840> can<00:00:57.960> see<00:00:58.309> there's<00:00:59.309> basically<00:00:59.730> been

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
you can see there's basically been

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.910 
you can see there's basically been
ketchup<00:01:00.539> paint<00:01:00.809> put<00:01:01.079> on<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.559> hope<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.800> can

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
ketchup paint put on this I hope you can

popular they're kind intended to rip off
the<00:03:25.790> pop<00:03:26.120> figures<00:03:26.480> or<00:03:26.690> the<00:03:26.840> property<00:03:27.710> and

everything<00:03:28.090> becomes<00:03:29.090> big<00:03:29.750> up<00:03:30.020> the<00:03:30.230> picture

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
set of fall from grace here so this is a

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.880 
set of fall from grace here so this is a
knockoff<00:03:33.650> Peppa<00:03:34.100> Pig<00:03:34.370> and<00:03:34.810> I<00:03:35.810> think<00:03:36.770> you'll

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
knockoff Peppa Pig and I think you'll

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.540 
knockoff Peppa Pig and I think you'll
see<00:03:37.130> that<00:03:37.160> it<00:03:37.370> actually<00:03:37.490> looks<00:03:37.760> pretty<00:03:38.110> good

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
see that it actually looks pretty good

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.890 
see that it actually looks pretty good
considering<00:03:40.550> this<00:03:40.850> is<00:03:40.970> a<00:03:41.000> knockoff<00:03:41.480> toy<00:03:41.720> and<00:03:41.840> I

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
considering this is a knockoff toy and I

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.110 
considering this is a knockoff toy and I
should<00:03:42.080> never<00:03:42.320> be<00:03:42.470> saying<00:03:42.770> this<00:03:42.950> it's<00:03:43.880> got<00:03:44.030> an

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
should never be saying this it's got an

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.450 
should never be saying this it's got an

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:46.460 
articulating head it's on a different

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.490 
articulating head it's on a different
scale<00:03:46.730> to<00:03:47.000> those<00:03:47.150> other<00:03:47.360> pop<00:03:47.960> figures<00:03:48.260> I<00:03:48.350> think

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
scale to those other pop figures I think

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.660 
scale to those other pop figures I think
pop<00:03:48.710> figures<00:03:48.950> come<00:03:49.130> in<00:03:49.220> different<00:03:49.490> scales

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
pop figures come in different scales

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.180 
pop figures come in different scales
I've<00:03:49.820> seen<00:03:49.970> massive<00:03:50.360> ones<00:03:50.570> and<00:03:50.780> the<00:03:50.840> shops<00:03:51.190> but

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
I've seen massive ones and the shops but

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.780 
I've seen massive ones and the shops but
nevertheless<00:03:52.520> that<00:03:53.060> Peppa<00:03:53.330> Pig<00:03:53.770> is<00:03:54.790> actually

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
nevertheless that Peppa Pig is actually

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.990 
nevertheless that Peppa Pig is actually
a<00:03:56.030> far<00:03:56.690> better<00:03:56.840> looking<00:03:56.960> toy<00:03:57.680> than<00:03:58.040> this<00:03:58.520> real

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
a far better looking toy than this real

all by itself all during the video ideas

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.140 
all by itself all during the video ideas
blu-tac<00:04:21.010> to<00:04:22.010> basically<00:04:22.280> study<00:04:22.610> this<00:04:22.760> figure

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
blu-tac to basically study this figure

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.840 
blu-tac to basically study this figure
and<00:04:23.360> i<00:04:23.780> think<00:04:24.140> of<00:04:24.800> all<00:04:25.070> of<00:04:25.280> these<00:04:25.400> figures<00:04:25.640> that

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
and i think of all of these figures that

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.370 
and i think of all of these figures that
we've<00:04:25.970> got<00:04:26.210> this<00:04:26.510> is<00:04:26.690> the<00:04:26.810> only<00:04:26.990> one

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
we've got this is the only one

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.120 
we've got this is the only one
it<00:04:27.500> doesn't<00:04:27.830> stand<00:04:28.040> up<00:04:28.310> by<00:04:28.550> bringing<00:04:29.300> Rigby

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
it doesn't stand up by bringing Rigby

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.260 
it doesn't stand up by bringing Rigby
he's<00:04:31.130> got<00:04:31.370> that<00:04:31.490> problem<00:04:31.700> he's<00:04:31.910> balanced

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
he's got that problem he's balanced

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.200 
he's got that problem he's balanced
properly<00:04:32.660> so<00:04:33.470> it<00:04:33.740> has<00:04:33.890> been<00:04:34.130> really<00:04:34.550> thinking

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
properly so it has been really thinking

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.200 
properly so it has been really thinking
what's<00:04:36.200> going<00:04:36.560> on<00:04:36.770> with<00:04:37.520> this<00:04:37.640> figure<00:04:38.000> here

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
what's going on with this figure here

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.440 
what's going on with this figure here
how<00:04:38.840> come<00:04:39.110> is<00:04:39.290> it<00:04:39.770> such<00:04:40.400> a<00:04:40.430> poorly<00:04:41.000> finished

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
how come is it such a poorly finished

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.810 
how come is it such a poorly finished
off<00:04:41.600> figure<00:04:41.900> how<00:04:42.740> come<00:04:43.010> doesn't<00:04:43.340> it<00:04:43.430> stand<00:04:43.670> up

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
off figure how come doesn't it stand up

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.310 
off figure how come doesn't it stand up
maybe<00:04:44.360> other<00:04:44.600> people<00:04:44.750> have<00:04:44.870> got<00:04:45.050> one<00:04:45.140> of<00:04:45.200> these

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
maybe other people have got one of these

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.770 
maybe other people have got one of these
and<00:04:45.500> tell<00:04:45.590> me<00:04:45.710> if<00:04:45.770> everyone<00:04:46.010> stands<00:04:46.310> up<00:04:46.780> can't

and tell me if everyone stands up can't

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.660 
and tell me if everyone stands up can't
get<00:04:47.900> it<00:04:48.020> to<00:04:48.490> it's<00:04:49.490> a<00:04:49.820> bit<00:04:50.090> of<00:04:50.210> a<00:04:50.330> pop<00:04:50.720> figure

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670 
get it to it's a bit of a pop figure

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:56.860 
get it to it's a bit of a pop figure
mystery<00:04:53.950> and<00:04:54.950> possibly<00:04:55.490> what<00:04:55.640> I<00:04:55.670> should<00:04:55.910> do<00:04:56.060> is

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
mystery and possibly what I should do is

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.530 
mystery and possibly what I should do is
return<00:04:57.260> this<00:04:57.470> back<00:04:57.710> to<00:04:57.860> I<00:04:57.890> purchased<00:04:58.370> it

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
return this back to I purchased it

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.690 
return this back to I purchased it
considering<00:04:59.540> how<00:04:59.630> much<00:04:59.720> I<00:04:59.870> pay<00:04:59.990> for<00:05:00.200> it<00:05:00.260> and<00:05:01.220> go

considering how much I pay for it and go

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.640 
considering how much I pay for it and go
and<00:05:01.940> get<00:05:02.060> another<00:05:02.270> one<00:05:02.360> or<00:05:02.840> find<00:05:03.260> one<00:05:03.440> which

isn't as ruffnut painted as that one so

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.780 
isn't as ruffnut painted as that one so
