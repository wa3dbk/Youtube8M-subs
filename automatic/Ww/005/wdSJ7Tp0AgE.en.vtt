00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
space you see thick as you can see

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.480 
space you see thick as you can see
whatever<00:02:10.160> you<00:02:10.250> select<00:02:10.399> one<00:02:10.759> from<00:02:10.910> the<00:02:11.000> list<00:02:11.090> it

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
but that doesn't mean that you can't

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.100 
but that doesn't mean that you can't
have<00:02:19.790> them<00:02:19.940> more<00:02:20.090> than<00:02:20.209> once<00:02:20.390> I<00:02:20.630> was<00:02:20.870> trying<00:02:21.080> to
