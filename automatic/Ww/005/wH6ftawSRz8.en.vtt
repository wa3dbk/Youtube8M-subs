00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:04.169 
nudge to begin with but for some reason

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:07.069 
nudge to begin with but for some reason
the<00:02:04.229> captain<00:02:04.619> budge<00:02:05.099> so<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:06.179> gave<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.779> second

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
the captain budge so I gave it a second

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.560 
the captain budge so I gave it a second
one<00:02:07.169> and<00:02:07.349> as<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:07.950> turned<00:02:08.130> out<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:09.210> second

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
one and as it turned out the second

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.960 
one and as it turned out the second
little<00:02:10.020> nudge<00:02:10.320> was<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.830> little<00:02:11.190> too<00:02:11.340> strong<00:02:11.610> for

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
little nudge was a little too strong for

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
blood will actually keep flowing to the

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.199 
blood will actually keep flowing to the
point<00:03:27.770> where<00:03:27.890> I<00:03:27.920> had<00:03:28.010> to<00:03:28.310> you<00:03:28.550> know<00:03:28.640> Thai<00:03:28.850> place

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
deep and actually at least get it

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:41.890 
deep and actually at least get it
cleaned<00:03:40.790> properly<00:03:40.970> I<00:03:41.239> didn't<00:03:41.540> have<00:03:41.660> anything

the doctor was like oh no it's actually

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.390 
the doctor was like oh no it's actually
deep<00:03:50.480> enough<00:03:50.720> to<00:03:50.840> get<00:03:51.020> stitches<00:03:51.260> but<00:03:51.770> we<00:03:52.250> can

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
deep enough to get stitches but we can

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.460 
deep enough to get stitches but we can
also<00:03:52.520> tape<00:03:52.820> it<00:03:53.030> anyway<00:03:53.600> they<00:03:54.020> patched<00:03:54.230> it<00:03:54.380> up

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
also tape it anyway they patched it up

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.949 
also tape it anyway they patched it up
everything's<00:03:55.010> fine<00:03:55.070> but<00:03:55.790> as<00:03:55.970> a<00:03:56.150> result<00:03:56.630> and

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
everything's fine but as a result and

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.290 
everything's fine but as a result and
well<00:03:57.680> this<00:03:57.800> is<00:03:57.860> why<00:03:58.100> I<00:03:58.130> couldn't<00:03:58.940> really<00:03:59.150> play

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
well this is why I couldn't really play

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.600 
well this is why I couldn't really play
warfare<00:03:59.750> or<00:03:59.810> anything<00:04:00.110> I<00:04:00.320> know<00:04:00.920> finger<00:04:01.370> was

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
warfare or anything I know finger was

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.640 
warfare or anything I know finger was
completely<00:04:02.239> unusable<00:04:02.540> to<00:04:03.140> the<00:04:03.230> point<00:04:03.440> where

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
completely unusable to the point where

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.650 
completely unusable to the point where
he<00:04:03.800> okay<00:04:04.070> the<00:04:04.190> tip<00:04:04.580> was<00:04:04.700> bandaged<00:04:05.270> off<00:04:05.450> and

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
he okay the tip was bandaged off and

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:06.880 
he okay the tip was bandaged off and
everything<00:04:05.840> but<00:04:06.080> the<00:04:06.230> whole<00:04:06.410> thing<00:04:06.440> actually

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
everything but the whole thing actually

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.630 
everything but the whole thing actually
hurt<00:04:07.310> because<00:04:07.760> I<00:04:08.320> like<00:04:09.320> I<00:04:09.470> had<00:04:09.860> barely<00:04:10.250> missed

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
hurt because I like I had barely missed

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.240 
hurt because I like I had barely missed
one<00:04:10.880> of<00:04:10.970> the<00:04:11.060> nerves<00:04:11.269> and<00:04:11.630> anyway<00:04:12.110> the<00:04:13.100> point

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
one of the nerves and anyway the point

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.030 
one of the nerves and anyway the point
is<00:04:13.430> my<00:04:13.820> middle<00:04:14.060> finger<00:04:14.450> was<00:04:14.630> quite<00:04:15.040> damaged

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
is my middle finger was quite damaged

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.060 
is my middle finger was quite damaged
and<00:04:16.810> as<00:04:17.810> a<00:04:18.080> result<00:04:18.260> of<00:04:18.500> that<00:04:18.560> I<00:04:18.650> couldn't

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
and as a result of that I couldn't

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.310 
and as a result of that I couldn't
actually<00:04:19.250> hope<00:04:19.910> a<00:04:20.120> controller<00:04:20.540> properly<00:04:21.109> like

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
actually hope a controller properly like

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.719 
actually hope a controller properly like
for<00:04:21.470> example<00:04:21.560> this<00:04:21.979> game<00:04:22.250> the<00:04:22.490> way<00:04:22.610> I'm

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
for example this game the way I'm

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:23.480 
for example this game the way I'm
playing<00:04:22.880> it<00:04:23.150> is

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
playing it is

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.309 
playing it is
picture<00:04:24.120> yourself<00:04:24.210> holding<00:04:24.840> a<00:04:25.050> ps3

00:04:25.309 --> 00:04:25.319 
picture yourself holding a ps3

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:27.770 
picture yourself holding a ps3
controller<00:04:25.860> and<00:04:26.160> now<00:04:26.520> take<00:04:26.970> your<00:04:27.180> right<00:04:27.449> hand

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
controller and now take your right hand

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.469 
controller and now take your right hand
middle<00:04:28.440> finger<00:04:28.770> off<00:04:28.979> it<00:04:29.310> like<00:04:29.970> now<00:04:30.150> the<00:04:30.210> tip

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 
middle finger off it like now the tip

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:32.270 
middle finger off it like now the tip
the<00:04:30.750> entire<00:04:31.080> thing<00:04:31.440> take<00:04:31.650> it<00:04:31.770> off<00:04:31.889> and<00:04:32.099> then

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
the entire thing take it off and then

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.270 
the entire thing take it off and then
try<00:04:32.490> walking<00:04:33.060> around<00:04:33.240> aiming<00:04:33.690> like<00:04:33.840> that<00:04:34.280> it's

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
try walking around aiming like that it's

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.520 
try walking around aiming like that it's
not<00:04:35.520> easy<00:04:35.759> trust<00:04:36.240> me<00:04:36.479> like<00:04:36.810> you<00:04:37.050> know<00:04:37.139> I<00:04:37.169> played

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
not easy trust me like you know I played

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:38.930 
not easy trust me like you know I played
with<00:04:37.650> Tenzin's<00:04:38.009> Tiffany<00:04:38.370> all<00:04:38.490> that<00:04:38.669> it's

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
with Tenzin's Tiffany all that it's

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.580 
with Tenzin's Tiffany all that it's
really<00:04:39.509> not<00:04:39.840> the<00:04:40.050> easiest<00:04:40.289> thing<00:04:40.500> ever

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
really not the easiest thing ever

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.890 
really not the easiest thing ever
because<00:04:40.860> you<00:04:41.759> don't<00:04:41.970> actually<00:04:42.180> get<00:04:42.479> to<00:04:42.539> grip

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
because you don't actually get to grip

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.300 
because you don't actually get to grip
the<00:04:43.020> controller<00:04:43.349> properly<00:04:43.919> so<00:04:44.099> you<00:04:44.160> don't

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
the controller properly so you don't

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.760 
the controller properly so you don't
have<00:04:44.430> any<00:04:44.490> you<00:04:44.910> know<00:04:44.940> you<00:04:45.090> don't<00:04:45.270> have<00:04:45.770> you

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
have any you know you don't have you

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.379 
have any you know you don't have you
don't<00:04:46.800> feel<00:04:47.099> safe<00:04:47.370> with<00:04:47.610> it<00:04:47.759> and<00:04:48.000> you<00:04:48.150> can't

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
don't feel safe with it and you can't

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.600 
don't feel safe with it and you can't
even<00:04:48.419> aim<00:04:48.750> properly<00:04:48.930> so<00:04:49.380> when<00:04:50.099> I<00:04:50.130> got<00:04:50.370> this

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
even aim properly so when I got this

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.520 
even aim properly so when I got this
game<00:04:50.849> you<00:04:51.000> know<00:04:51.090> this<00:04:51.300> was<00:04:51.539> I<00:04:51.810> think<00:04:52.110> this<00:04:52.380> was

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
game you know this was I think this was

handicap now of course it's a little
late<00:05:07.770> in<00:05:07.889> the<00:05:07.949> video<00:05:08.190> but<00:05:08.460> i<00:05:08.639> would<00:05:08.819> say<00:05:08.970> if<00:05:09.180> you

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
late in the video but i would say if you

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 
do end up watching it again by some

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:12.770

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.390 
chance pay attention to how I play
because<00:05:13.110> the<00:05:13.139> entire<00:05:13.560> game<00:05:13.860> I'm<00:05:14.069> actually<00:05:14.220> a

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
because the entire game I'm actually a

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.980 
because the entire game I'm actually a
lot<00:05:14.580> slower<00:05:14.759> on<00:05:15.090> my<00:05:15.210> feet<00:05:15.419> you<00:05:15.539> know<00:05:15.599> I<00:05:15.690> can't

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
lot slower on my feet you know I can't

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.540 
lot slower on my feet you know I can't
really<00:05:16.080> turn<00:05:16.259> around<00:05:16.560> as<00:05:16.710> well<00:05:16.860> and<00:05:17.130> all<00:05:17.340> that

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
really turn around as well and all that

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.820 
really turn around as well and all that
but<00:05:18.150> although<00:05:18.389> I<00:05:18.539> carried<00:05:18.930> the<00:05:19.020> flag<00:05:19.229> quite<00:05:19.800> a

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
but although I carried the flag quite a

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.950 
but although I carried the flag quite a
few<00:05:20.039> times<00:05:20.069> I<00:05:20.400> managed<00:05:20.639> to<00:05:20.669> you<00:05:21.389> know<00:05:21.419> finish

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
few times I managed to you know finish

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.189 
few times I managed to you know finish
with<00:05:22.229> a<00:05:22.259> okay<00:05:22.740> score<00:05:23.099> and<00:05:23.750> the<00:05:24.750> one<00:05:24.930> thing<00:05:25.080> you

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:25.199 
with a okay score and the one thing you

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:27.230 
with a okay score and the one thing you
have<00:05:25.289> to<00:05:25.349> notice<00:05:25.560> is<00:05:25.860> I<00:05:26.009> did<00:05:26.789> that<00:05:26.970> mainly

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
have to notice is I did that mainly

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
because I was a bit more defensive in my

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:31.040 
because I was a bit more defensive in my
style<00:05:29.909> playing<00:05:30.300> I<00:05:30.419> mean<00:05:30.449> you<00:05:30.630> know<00:05:30.690> it's<00:05:30.870> still

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
was a little bit more careful especially

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.100
