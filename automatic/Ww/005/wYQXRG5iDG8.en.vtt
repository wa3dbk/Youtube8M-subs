00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
length you need you'll just calculate

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:34.580

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
with the help of your calculator suppose

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.500 
with the help of your calculator suppose
you<00:02:35.370> need<00:02:35.579> an<00:02:35.760> animation<00:02:36.720> of<00:02:36.989> 10<00:02:37.200> seconds<00:02:38.510> so

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
you need an animation of 10 seconds so

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.940 
you need an animation of 10 seconds so
you<00:02:40.200> will<00:02:40.409> multiply<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.819> 10<00:02:42.709> seconds<00:02:44.720> to<00:02:45.720> the

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
you will multiply the 10 seconds to the

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.589 
you will multiply the 10 seconds to the
24<00:02:46.950> frames<00:02:49.760> ultimately<00:02:50.760> you<00:02:51.000> have<00:02:51.030> come<00:02:51.450> to

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
24 frames ultimately you have come to

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.410 
24 frames ultimately you have come to
know<00:02:51.629> the<00:02:52.440> frames<00:02:52.829> the<00:02:53.760> numbers<00:02:54.120> of<00:02:54.150> the

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
know the frames the numbers of the

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.740 
know the frames the numbers of the
frames<00:02:54.750> which<00:02:55.379> you<00:02:55.530> will<00:02:55.620> specify<00:02:55.980> in<00:02:56.750> start

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
frames which you will specify in start

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.599 
frames which you will specify in start
and<00:02:57.989> framing<00:02:59.000> settings<00:03:00.000> and<00:03:00.620> in<00:03:01.620> this<00:03:01.829> way<00:03:02.069> you

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
and framing settings and in this way you

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:09.080 
and framing settings and in this way you
know<00:03:03.019> your<00:03:04.019> frames<00:03:04.439> numbers<00:03:05.090> and<00:03:07.519> then<00:03:08.519> you

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
know your frames numbers and then you

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.780 
know your frames numbers and then you
put<00:03:09.329> your<00:03:09.510> frames<00:03:10.069> numbers<00:03:12.560> in<00:03:13.560> dream<00:03:14.400> may
