00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.990
 trick 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.360
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.610
 clean your shoes in velvet calfskin 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.380
 we can call it suede from a 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.759
 tuner goal velvet calf but that's 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.460
 always the same thing in fact it's the 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:25.590
 inner part of the leather that gives this 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.570
 very soft leather then there actually 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.099
 you see my cat vomited on me 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.720
 I'm really not happy but I 'm going 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.950
 show you how to clean that up 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.960
 catch everything up you'll see it's 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.149
 magic we will start by using a 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.500
 wooden shoe trees that you find 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:44.430
 in all the street ropes where the big 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:46.050
 shops like that the boot and well 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.820
 heard we will be able to work on it 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.430
 easily 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.980
 then we use soap marseille 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.040
 very simple and an old sponge 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.620
 we start by setting the water to have a 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.480
 warm water warm limit 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:04.229
 then we moisten well completely 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.810
 the whole boot sponges her as well 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.450
 will rub on the scratching part with 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:14.219
 the marseille soap for then 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:17.369
 be able to scratch the job well until 

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:19.319
 to leave, that's where you understand 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.170
 all the interest of langres choir which we 

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:24.659
 serves as support 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.609
 we clean the whole boot 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.889
 because actually we will remove everything 

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:31.499
 which is dust eventual pollution 

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:34.139
 so it will clear up 

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:35.670
 the whole boot will clean well 

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:42.319
 sure the second vote for it to be 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:44.790
 uniform one completely shaves the boot 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:49.280
 under water 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.280
 to remove all traces of soap 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.020
 and now the task is even party abbott 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.880
 is all clean 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.490
 we will now let it dry away 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.530
 from the sun and away from the radiators to the air 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.800
 free and dry for at least three 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.270
 days 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.820
 because as it is a box oven is there 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.920
 it is well waterlogged the three 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.960
 days have passed and this is the box 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.240

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.920
 we'll brush it with rights which 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:27.270
 is called pancake brushes that are 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:29.480

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:34.459
 do not hesitate to lend in every way 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.459

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.900
 hello he has found all his sweetness 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.730
 during the base of a bad scale 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.159
 has a lot of throats and so the bank 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.989
 a robin quoted Romanesque years to the data 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:55.180
 thanks to immunity to a double benefit 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.459
 first go colorful we go for example 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.440
 we would have the boot of the box colors 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.239
 and then they are worth internalizing this 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.720
 who will protect the surcharges 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.459
 potential 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.650
 now it's a product we find 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.000
 everywhere all the shoemakers but who 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.280
 are not very good for the most 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.370

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.609
 staying at a distance of about 20 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.609
 centimeters all around 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.879
 now we let a work dry 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.799
