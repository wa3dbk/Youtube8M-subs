you<00:02:41.209> learned<00:02:41.450> about<00:02:41.540> a<00:02:41.690> chassis<00:02:42.049> all<00:02:42.560> this<00:02:42.860> is

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
you learned about a chassis all this is

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.740 
you learned about a chassis all this is
really<00:02:43.250> closely<00:02:43.640> interlinked<00:02:44.090> and<00:02:44.420> that<00:02:44.630> is

so fascinating and when I come back now
after<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.350> semester<00:02:48.560> I<00:02:49.040> will<00:02:49.430> have<00:02:49.580> a

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
after the semester I will have a

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.370 
after the semester I will have a
completely<00:02:50.090> different<00:02:50.630> view<00:02:50.840> on<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:51.140> things

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
completely different view on the things

completely different view on the things
when<00:02:51.650> I<00:02:51.680> go<00:02:51.950> through<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:52.280> workshop<00:02:52.489> halls<00:02:53.000> and

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
when I go through the workshop halls and

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.210 
when I go through the workshop halls and
will<00:02:53.390> think<00:02:53.630> ah<00:02:53.900> this<00:02:54.500> is<00:02:54.650> implemented<00:02:55.190> here

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
will think ah this is implemented here

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.550 
will think ah this is implemented here
there<00:02:55.880> is<00:02:56.030> that<00:02:56.269> this<00:02:56.900> change<00:02:57.230> between

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
there is that this change between

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.860 
there is that this change between

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
practical experience in theory who is

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.720 
practical experience in theory who is
the<00:03:00.079> strong<00:03:00.380> point<00:03:00.709> of<00:03:00.860> a<00:03:00.980> cooperative<00:03:01.459> work

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
the strong point of a cooperative work

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.980 
the strong point of a cooperative work
study<00:03:02.120> degree<00:03:02.480> program<00:03:02.959> in<00:03:02.989> my<00:03:03.620> opinion
