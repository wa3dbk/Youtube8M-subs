00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:13.730
 Japan has entered the twentieth century as a national transformation type 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:20.810
 A country isolated from the outside world in a secluded country was on the road to the world's largest powerhouse 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:24.340
 After the opening of the country, we made efforts to establish important industrial fields such as shipbuilding and 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:31.480
 I was about to catch up with another country 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:34.380
 Experts from overseas were invited to foster Japanese engineers, and Japanese themselves have also jumped overseas 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:41.500
 I learned new technology 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:46.579
 And Japan, which started from scratch after a few decades, will catch up with the technical field 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:51.490
 It has become a power that controls the surrounding area implicitly 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:55.890
 Japan, which was increasing its power, began to draw attention to neighboring countries 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:01:02.480
 The purpose is the expansion of influence and territory 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:10.080
 Under such circumstances, the Ryukyuan annexation of Okinawa in 1879 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:16.530
 In 1895, it won the Sino-Japanese War, and as a result, it received Taiwan's custody 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:18.790
 Another war over the subdivisions of the power sphere was fought from 1904 to the following year 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:25.070
 Russo-Japanese war 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:29.960
 Japan also won this and annexed Korea in 1910 as a result 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:33.890
 Century these victory in the turn of the Imperial Japanese Army 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:41.170
 And the naval glory and the Japanese people 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:45.090
 At the same time as being patient with the invincible Japanese army , Japan strengthened its conviction that it should be a leader in Asia 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:49.159
 1922 Japan is classified as a regular carrier 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.159
 The performed by introducing the first in the world 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:02:00.090
 Then aircraft carrier fraction was soon commissioned is initially 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:02.170
 These facts that they were remodeled aircraft carriers built as warships emphasized the importance of naval aircraft 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.480
 It is shown that 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:09.789
 It has been operating the Imperial Army and nursing different issue Miya machine 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:15.060
 The development of expectations was also done separately 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:21.970
 In fact, the army and the navy are completely separate and independent organizations 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:30.720
 There may be times when you make a complete statement about the execution procedure and execution location of a military operation 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:37.590
 When Japan seized northern and central China in 1937 , a new war opened between the two countries 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:38.400
 Receiving the United States in Japan suicide of a middle-war day that broke out in China French Indochina position 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.460
 Against 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:48.710
 Determined oil and iron financial measures 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:53.960
 Japan had to seek other sources as these resources were essential to military operations 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:57.050
 Soon after, a new source is found in the European colonies of Southeast Asia 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:04.250
 Those lands were subject to military aggression 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:08.730
 The Japanese military headquarters for the implementation of financial measures will continue to advance to the south as Japan continues to the United States 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.130
 And increased the notion that confrontation with Britain was inevitable 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.770
 Hmm 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:22.370
 And then a plan for first strike will emerge 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:26.480
 One of the draft plans was to bring an aircraft carrier unit to Pearl Harbor Naval Base on Oahu , Hawaii. 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:32.090
 It was to add an air attack 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:36.569
 But the plan does not gain US understanding of Japan's legitimacy 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:42.160
 Only it was supposed to be executed when the peace talks broke down 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:49.330
 April 10, 1941 Japan establishes its first aircraft carrier unit 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:51.240
 The formation consists of three air squadrons consisting of three aircraft carriers, and this is the world's first large scale 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:57.840
 It was a carrier fleet 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:59.370
 And since the US Navy put an end to Japanese secrecy, in the first century 5-1941 November 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:06.600
 26th 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:11.230
 Mainly composed of six aircraft carriers of red- black 蒼 飛 翔 瑞 瑞 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:13.709
 Imperial Navy First Air Fleet departed for Hawaii 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.709
 Ah ah ah
