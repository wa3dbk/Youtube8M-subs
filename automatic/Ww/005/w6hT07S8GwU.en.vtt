producing a lot more videos lately
there's<00:02:22.270> a<00:02:22.390> lot<00:02:22.450> shorter<00:02:22.810> now<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.500> reason<00:02:23.650> for

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
there's a lot shorter now the reason for

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.290 
there's a lot shorter now the reason for
that<00:02:23.890> is<00:02:24.130> because<00:02:24.160> doing<00:02:24.640> these<00:02:24.760> super<00:02:25.060> super

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
that is because doing these super super

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.020 
that is because doing these super super
long<00:02:25.420> videos<00:02:25.720> was<00:02:25.960> really<00:02:26.170> really<00:02:26.290> tiring<00:02:26.590> and

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
long videos was really really tiring and

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.250 
long videos was really really tiring and
like<00:02:28.030> that's<00:02:28.240> what<00:02:28.420> got<00:02:28.600> me<00:02:28.630> into<00:02:28.990> doing

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
like that's what got me into doing

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.870 
like that's what got me into doing
honestly<00:02:29.740> a<00:02:29.800> lot<00:02:29.920> of<00:02:30.070> the<00:02:30.160> toxic<00:02:30.610> kind<00:02:30.790> of

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
honestly a lot of the toxic kind of

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.150 
honestly a lot of the toxic kind of
stuff<00:02:31.030> was<00:02:31.630> because<00:02:31.960> I<00:02:31.990> couldn't<00:02:32.500> like<00:02:32.950> if

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.710 
for my intro than I don't know I've it's
I<00:03:00.610> mean<00:03:00.910> it's<00:03:00.940> supposed<00:03:01.209> to<00:03:01.240> be<00:03:01.330> a<00:03:01.360> hook<00:03:01.540> but

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
I mean it's supposed to be a hook but

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.690 
I mean it's supposed to be a hook but
it's<00:03:01.840> not<00:03:01.990> necessarily<00:03:02.830> why<00:03:03.070> I<00:03:03.100> want<00:03:03.550> to<00:03:03.610> keep

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
it's not necessarily why I want to keep

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.040 
it's not necessarily why I want to keep
catch<00:03:03.940> people<00:03:04.180> detention<00:03:04.570> I<00:03:04.690> knew<00:03:04.840> from<00:03:04.959> the

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
catch people detention I knew from the

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.630 
catch people detention I knew from the
beginning<00:03:05.140> a<00:03:05.410> 30<00:03:05.620> second<00:03:05.920> intro<00:03:06.130> was<00:03:06.310> too<00:03:06.459> long

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
beginning a 30 second intro was too long

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.090 
beginning a 30 second intro was too long
so<00:03:07.209> I've<00:03:07.420> cut<00:03:08.080> it<00:03:08.170> down<00:03:08.230> to<00:03:08.290> about<00:03:08.440> 10<00:03:08.740> seconds

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
so I've cut it down to about 10 seconds

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.400 
so I've cut it down to about 10 seconds
now<00:03:09.250> and<00:03:09.520> that's<00:03:10.450> pretty<00:03:10.600> much<00:03:10.720> what<00:03:11.320> it's

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
now and that's pretty much what it's

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.720 
now and that's pretty much what it's
going<00:03:11.530> to<00:03:11.590> be<00:03:11.650> in<00:03:11.830> the<00:03:11.950> shorter<00:03:12.190> videos<00:03:12.459> when<00:03:12.700> I
