same at first sight I was uninspired by

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.960 
same at first sight I was uninspired by
the<00:00:18.990> French<00:00:19.439> Revolution<00:00:19.640> mostly<00:00:20.640> because<00:00:20.699> of

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
the French Revolution mostly because of

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.640 
the French Revolution mostly because of
where<00:00:21.210> assassin<00:00:21.570> creed<00:00:21.720> 4<00:00:21.930> was<00:00:22.140> set<00:00:22.380> with<00:00:22.500> the

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
where assassin creed 4 was set with the

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.019 
where assassin creed 4 was set with the
Pirates<00:00:23.100> I'm<00:00:23.279> sure<00:00:23.430> you<00:00:23.519> can<00:00:23.670> all<00:00:23.730> agree<00:00:23.850> that

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
Pirates I'm sure you can all agree that

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.599 
Pirates I'm sure you can all agree that
you<00:00:24.240> felt<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.539> same<00:00:24.570> but<00:00:25.439> after<00:00:25.650> doing<00:00:26.369> some

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
you felt the same but after doing some

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.810 
you felt the same but after doing some
research<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:27.300> watching<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.630> trailer<00:00:27.900> I'm

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
research and watching the trailer I'm

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.279 
research and watching the trailer I'm
fairly<00:00:29.820> optimistic<00:00:29.970> about<00:00:30.570> where<00:00:30.840> it's<00:00:31.050> set

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
fairly optimistic about where it's set

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.680 
fairly optimistic about where it's set
so<00:00:31.980> first<00:00:32.309> let's<00:00:32.850> watch<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.059> trailer<00:00:33.090> and

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
so first let's watch the trailer and

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.299 
so first let's watch the trailer and
then<00:00:33.870> I'll<00:00:34.200> go<00:00:34.380> through<00:00:34.680> what<00:00:34.950> caught<00:00:35.130> my<00:00:35.280> eye

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
then I'll go through what caught my eye

00:00:35.309 --> 00:01:44.630 
then I'll go through what caught my eye
step<00:00:35.730> by<00:00:35.850> step

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.730 

right<00:01:45.640> then<00:01:45.850> as<00:01:46.210> you<00:01:46.390> can<00:01:46.510> see<00:01:46.720> it<00:01:47.020> opens<00:01:47.620> up

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
right then as you can see it opens up

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.310 
right then as you can see it opens up
onto<00:01:47.950> a<00:01:48.040> royal<00:01:48.310> building<00:01:48.700> now<00:01:49.240> this<00:01:49.990> is<00:01:50.050> where

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
onto a royal building now this is where

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.170 
onto a royal building now this is where
things<00:01:50.530> get<00:01:50.770> interesting<00:01:50.830> because<00:01:51.760> I<00:01:51.940> didn't

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
things get interesting because I didn't

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.270 
things get interesting because I didn't
know<00:01:52.300> a<00:01:52.540> lot<00:01:52.780> about<00:01:52.990> the<00:01:53.320> French<00:01:53.530> Revolution<00:01:53.620> I

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
know a lot about the French Revolution I

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.740 
know a lot about the French Revolution I
thought<00:01:54.520> it<00:01:54.580> might<00:01:54.760> be<00:01:54.880> a<00:01:54.910> good<00:01:54.940> idea<00:01:55.090> to<00:01:55.540> do

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
thought it might be a good idea to do

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.710 
thought it might be a good idea to do
some<00:01:55.960> research<00:01:56.140> well<00:01:57.130> I<00:01:57.490> went<00:01:58.150> on<00:01:58.240> Wikipedia

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
some research well I went on Wikipedia

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.590 
some research well I went on Wikipedia
but<00:01:58.780> is<00:01:59.020> still<00:01:59.170> research<00:01:59.560> nonetheless<00:01:59.860> and

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
but is still research nonetheless and

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.450 
but is still research nonetheless and
here's<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:01.780> basic<00:02:01.900> overview<00:02:02.470> of<00:02:02.770> what

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
here's the basic overview of what

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.640 
here's the basic overview of what
actually<00:02:03.610> happened<00:02:04.240> the<00:02:04.690> revolution<00:02:05.229> lasted

think<00:03:48.160> we'll<00:03:48.280> be<00:03:48.310> able<00:03:48.460> to<00:03:48.610> actually<00:03:49.120> enter<00:03:49.600> a

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.020 
think we'll be able to actually enter a

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.930 
think we'll be able to actually enter a
lot<00:03:50.290> more<00:03:50.500> buildings<00:03:50.980> which<00:03:51.250> again<00:03:51.700> will

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
lot more buildings which again will

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.490 
lot more buildings which again will

the<00:04:03.430> 16th<00:04:03.820> was<00:04:03.970> executed<00:04:04.450> so<00:04:05.260> this<00:04:05.620> could

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
the 16th was executed so this could

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.070 
the 16th was executed so this could
possibly<00:04:06.040> be<00:04:06.400> him<00:04:06.640> but<00:04:07.540> during<00:04:07.900> the
