just wanted the SATA cable and the power
cable<00:01:16.220> from<00:01:16.580> our<00:01:16.790> drive<00:01:17.030> then<00:01:17.860> no<00:01:18.860> served<00:01:19.160> up

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 
cable from our drive then no served up

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.970 
cable from our drive then no served up
your<00:01:19.820> hard<00:01:20.330> drive<00:01:20.540> might<00:01:20.960> have<00:01:21.260> squeezed<00:01:21.950> a

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
your hard drive might have squeezed a

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.520 
your hard drive might have squeezed a
test<00:01:22.280> to<00:01:22.460> it<00:01:22.580> but<00:01:23.240> most<00:01:23.480> don't

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
test to it but most don't

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.300
