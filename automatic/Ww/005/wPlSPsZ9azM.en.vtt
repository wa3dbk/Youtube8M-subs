what up guys out from hypos I just

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.579 
what up guys out from hypos I just
finished<00:00:03.510> it<00:00:03.540> up<00:00:03.659> as<00:00:03.750> a<00:00:03.780> glass<00:00:04.020> house<00:00:04.259> its

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
finished it up as a glass house its

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.030 
finished it up as a glass house its
Caprice<00:00:05.370> and<00:00:05.960> so<00:00:06.960> we<00:00:07.080> do<00:00:07.200> a<00:00:07.230> pretty<00:00:07.470> basic

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
Caprice and so we do a pretty basic

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.330 
Caprice and so we do a pretty basic
setup<00:00:08.519> to<00:00:08.700> pump<00:00:08.970> six<00:00:09.210> batteries<00:00:10.190> pretty<00:00:11.190> much

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
setup to pump six batteries pretty much

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.940 
setup to pump six batteries pretty much
like<00:00:11.519> most<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.820> ones<00:00:12.030> we<00:00:12.150> do<00:00:12.269> here<00:00:12.950> 2.6

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
like most the ones we do here 2.6

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.070 
like most the ones we do here 2.6
batteries<00:00:14.400> you<00:00:14.519> did<00:00:14.670> ask<00:00:14.849> for<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.089> custom<00:00:15.870> scene

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
batteries you did ask for a custom scene

see<00:00:16.289> into<00:00:16.590> blue<00:00:16.770> rack<00:00:17.510> so<00:00:18.510> we<00:00:18.630> did<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.840> lot<00:00:18.990> of

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
see into blue rack so we did a lot of

brand<00:00:59.010> new<00:00:59.960> Centennial<00:01:00.960> batteries<00:01:01.460> you're

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
brand new Centennial batteries you're

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.820 
brand new Centennial batteries you're
running<00:01:02.879> eights<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.539> eight<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.080> pretty<00:01:04.769> much

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
running eights and eight and pretty much

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.950 
running eights and eight and pretty much
so<00:01:05.010> HN<00:01:05.309> eights<00:01:05.549> all<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.880> way<00:01:05.970> around<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.810> the

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
so HN eights all the way around and the

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.240 
so HN eights all the way around and the
reason<00:01:07.200> we<00:01:07.290> did<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.650> because<00:01:07.860> the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
reason we did that is because the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.380 
reason we did that is because the
glasshouse<00:01:08.460> has<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.820> real<00:01:09.000> shallow<00:01:09.270> deck<00:01:09.570> on<00:01:09.780> it

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
glasshouse has a real shallow deck on it

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.480 
glasshouse has a real shallow deck on it
real<00:01:12.390> shallow<00:01:12.689> deck<00:01:13.049> so<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.799> reason<00:01:14.220> we<00:01:14.310> did

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
real shallow deck so the reason we did

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.270 
real shallow deck so the reason we did
that<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:15.210> he's<00:01:16.020> running<00:01:16.259> standard<00:01:16.979> coil

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
that is so he's running standard coil

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.370 
that is so he's running standard coil
under<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.450> cylinder<00:01:18.930> sits<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.259> little

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
under so the cylinder sits a little

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.990 
under so the cylinder sits a little
higher<00:01:19.590> on<00:01:19.619> coil<00:01:20.130> under<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.670> need<00:01:20.970> a

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
higher on coil under so you need a

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.399 
higher on coil under so you need a
little<00:01:21.330> more<00:01:21.479> play<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.439> little<00:01:23.310> more<00:01:23.520> room

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.350 

we<00:01:26.890> did<00:01:27.070> a<00:01:27.100> three<00:01:27.490> quarter<00:01:27.760> inch<00:01:27.790> tuck<00:01:28.120> in<00:01:28.270> the

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
we did a three quarter inch tuck in the

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.149 
we did a three quarter inch tuck in the
front<00:01:28.630> as<00:01:28.750> well<00:01:28.780> right<00:01:29.590> now<00:01:29.710> it's<00:01:29.920> kind<00:01:30.100> of

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
front as well right now it's kind of

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:31.290 
front as well right now it's kind of
hard<00:01:30.310> to<00:01:30.400> tell<00:01:30.550> because<00:01:30.670> it's<00:01:30.970> running<00:01:31.120> the

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
hard to tell because it's running the

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
hard to tell because it's running the
big<00:01:31.479> stock<00:01:32.050> tire<00:01:32.290> still<00:01:32.880> but<00:01:33.880> he<00:01:33.909> will<00:01:34.360> have<00:01:34.390> 13

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
big stock tire still but he will have 13

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.209 
big stock tire still but he will have 13
14<00:01:35.710> s<00:01:35.770> on<00:01:35.860> there<00:01:36.010> eventually

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:41.219 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:43.069 

did<00:01:41.759> just<00:01:41.909> get<00:01:41.999> all<00:01:42.119> cleaned<00:01:42.390> up<00:01:42.539> waxed<00:01:42.990> up

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
did just get all cleaned up waxed up

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.580 
did just get all cleaned up waxed up
again<00:01:43.409> using<00:01:44.280> killer<00:01:44.460> wax<00:01:45.079> okay<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.439> if<00:01:46.560> you

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
again using killer wax okay and if you

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.840 
again using killer wax okay and if you
guys<00:01:46.770> haven't<00:01:47.009> tried<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.460> much<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.759> guys

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
guys haven't tried that much you guys

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.370 
guys haven't tried that much you guys
get<00:01:48.119> some<00:01:48.329> try<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.719> out<00:01:48.899> you<00:01:49.049> can<00:01:49.079> order<00:01:49.350> a
