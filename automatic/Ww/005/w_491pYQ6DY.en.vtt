00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello friends draw are two years all 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.029
 It had been a while since it was going up 

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:10.479
 I ask for a turn 

00:00:10.479 --> 00:00:14.079
 good afternoon has brought another form than one that I had been asked to do the 

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:16.630
 revision and that this increase 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.190
 good that I can say in this way as well as all that 1 keeps part 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:23.849
 d of what is plastic 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:27.140
 and some parts are metal 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.259
 that's why sometimes where one or the color can vary a little bit to 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:32.750
 Although it is a 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:33.890
 all total 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.200
 but he estimated that this of his shows forms that does not change the color as 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.090
 you can see 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.430
 the color of both what is in the metal and what is plastic is good 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.590
 good unlike some others such as prob 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.450
 i 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.040
 silvero I'm not sure what we're going to do and what the names change 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.950
 many times we can sometimes notice the similarity of the transformers 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.480
 treated so I called a corner for example an honor that is soon 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.780
 but what to the difference of this model although it is the same mold 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.120
 we can practically see a difference mainly the defense 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.120
 front of the vehicle 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.120
 sotelo note can see that the cedeti that the entity 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.550
 it seems like this one had been added a piece of plastic has fallen 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.550
 to the post a decree defense by which is due to the effort must be done 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.570
 different not 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.820
 percent and the headlights are pretty much the same 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.820
 and we are also talking about what is the 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.520
 the back 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.820
 if you can see 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.030
 here you can see the difference 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.270
 here brings these this little 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.910
 alberto little lion that are here again transcended the model of 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:42.650
 the 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.670
 of the meadow do not bring it up does not set goals are the only differences that 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.950
 we can see about these two 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.130
 another way is properly that they are the same 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.760
 even concentrates forums are very similar 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.830
 bodies to proceed with the afp transformation tacoma and alcohol 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.369
 Well, something else may be good that told me 'is to emphasize this is to put 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.260
 1 38 large 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.800
 and already before rubber 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.239
 behind comma 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.589
 by plastic slime 

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:14.839
 that's why almost all of us can put a picture of them 

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:18.589
 I have been given the polls videos because kendra stain 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:22.159
 kenya stain of space because the um well is 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:24.929
 good to have all your commands 

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:27.159
 as you can see 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:29.219
 i its stickers 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:30.129
 heat 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:31.659
 badly put 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:34.269
 but it's good and it's coming from the factory 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:35.219
 percent 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:38.339
 Mario of the formation Jordi any one is a bit simple 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:44.289
 totally these models come virtually all the same 

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:47.800
 we do not take out what are the arms 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.689
 we can take them out 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:52.419
 be the sides 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:56.679
 i before this one that we open enters formulated with the woman that to spin 

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:58.979
 to what is this part of here 

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:01.979
 and I feel 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:06.719
 your against subtracted above 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:09.739
 from the camera, well, here is the 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.259
 practically already armed 

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:15.259
 this part here that problem 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.459
 we do not open a little 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:19.559
 for what 

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:21.579
 I know that I stopped 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:23.439
 well then 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:26.699
 with to see the simple transformation 

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:28.049
 i 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.279
 the arms 

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:33.279
 looking for what is owed this part of the decal here 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:37.819
 just like that of the other band 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:41.919
 so in this way 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:44.949
 we propose inmiscuyÃ³ we have motors gm motors 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:47.429
 g1 

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:49.849
 how I do not have much science 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:51.989
 the head and 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.239
 aside I have here they are red 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.529
 and then like all those who 1 

00:03:56.529 --> 00:03:58.649
 there's a month that I do not like much 

00:03:58.649 --> 00:04:02.949
 as the parties are raising the death live in the part as this 

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:04.189
 gun 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:07.779
 and says that this is the takara collection edition is very good is not 

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:09.169
 recommendable 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:13.909
 i the novices who bring arms coroma unlike the ones as it has it 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:15.649
 they got rid of height 

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:18.259
 petra ecclestone no 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:20.359
 they did not put him soon 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:21.389
 i 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.310
 apart are the triggers 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.310
 the cost of each one alone 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.919
 yes really the shots 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.889
 powerfully 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:36.039
 stop these 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:37.410
 they lowered the 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.450
 anyway 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.830
 as the sky remember what is the lar the g1 

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:46.219
 We offer from Mali times specialized press in Athens 

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:48.520
 as a vehicle forms 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.810
 much better than as robots 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.919
 hence, there was a man in them that meant carving of smoke 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:55.569
 practically his ex 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:56.870
 it was his skill 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.499
 but good that I want we have armed as you can see pressuna 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:03.889
 the very good figure I liked a lot 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.830
 the father of form in vehicles almost never transform robots between 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.509
 I like the most vehicle 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:11.509
 i 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:15.219
 separates unlike modern figures has no age 

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:19.439
 the possibility of putting him in a different position and since his non-separators 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.380
 Well, well, and it's practically 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.379
 already the shipowner transforms 

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:27.749
 on the other the bottom part 

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:32.069
 mediantes equal sum what you can I did not have to take it arturo do them to a 

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:33.069
 side 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:36.379
 so I could have a 

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:37.789
 position but 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:41.219
 that's why it transforms ends a little bit fallen forward 

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:46.059
 but well these little I wrote tumbacuero who was the one who said goodbye 

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:47.469
 but good here is 

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:48.430
 there is yes love 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.479
 fernando may comment to efe he found the region 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:54.970
 tax of grace all for having seen it we are pending 

00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:59.370
 efe for future editions recognizes one and other 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.150
 behind 10
