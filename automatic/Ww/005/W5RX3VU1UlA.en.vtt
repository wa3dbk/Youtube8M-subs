00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.960
 I can still get on this trip today 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.790
 goose bumps and the first time as me 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.360
 this orchestra was allowed to play the game 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.530
 now eleven years ago 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.570
 for many of you out there it is 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.729
 probably their previous lifetime 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.890
 and back then the whole thing was still going on 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:27.310
 I started to work differently from that time on 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.560
 the battlefield 1942 wake island demo he 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.170
 Right then, there was still demos 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.600
 and was not sold as a bidder well 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.549
 and there it was the game in which 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.439
 I not only in first person through the 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.990
 but also trudge with me 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:42.670
 a panzer fighter jet or 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.610
 battleship over the huge maps 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.590
 could move and the whole thing too 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.450
 still in the scenario of the second world war 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.399
 in whom I of history you are 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.929
 you were very interested in this and 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:58.390
 So I searched around the clock it was in 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:00.670
 internet or on the little five man 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.679
 room lan with friends and the good 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.720
 it was just damned 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:06.909
 Have fun and did not get bored 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.160
 but after a while see if 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.539
 Afterwards, you can do more with and after 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.700
 release which a month later 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.070
 I wanted to take my dream in 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.500
 this so-called dashboards area 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.739
 got hold of a foot and came there 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.700
 I had battlefield just right 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.530
 at that time already my luck with 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.600
 Counterstrike is trying to scratch her here 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.130
 at skil technically, however, in the naja hamm 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.989
 and at the end of the food chain 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.069
 which one is not at battlefield, however 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.799
 could claim 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.480
 and you would all want to own 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.609
 heard my beating prayer spoke to me 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.230
 At that time, his friend pointed to his clear 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:39.569
 which had recently joined 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.950
 just to dream sometimes 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.780
 and of course I did and would go 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.069
 a short trial period also with 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.799
 kissed hand 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:50.109
 From here began an online friendship 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.840
 I've been with people for more than eleven years now 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:55.480
 know and we have passed this 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.189
 the sharp complained called ourselves 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.319
 as a fan planning was clear with ours 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:01.629
 members aged 30 plus 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:04.209
 well, rather the underdogs what the 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:05.799
 However, the scene at that time was accomplished 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.019
 we do it through continuous training and 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:10.329
 playing and playing huge teamplay up 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.939
 Place like mouse board or users 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:14.530
 to overcome the survival of the fun 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:15.969
 but we always look forward to the foreground 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.139
 Of course, we win each other over and over 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:18.790
 We could talk about the time at the 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:21.549
 resident clans a corresponding 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.169
 Names make members came and went 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.090
 the hard core however and maintained 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:26.829
 after several clan wars and hundreds 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.810
 By playing it was time for something 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:31.230
 new and we did not have too much 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.230
 wait a long time 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.870
 rock'n'roll baby describes exactly that 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:31.139
 the feeling as I mean the first time 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.000
 virtual foot in vietnam put the from 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.800
 development studio dice decoupled 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.540
 Canadian studio developed the 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.180
 second part of the battle beat franchise 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.220
 and set new standards for me 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.840
 the setting of the vietnam war 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.360
 allows us an action-packed 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.790
 dogfights in a chatpartner hunting in the 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.870
 Combat helicopters or small kg in the 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.060
 thicket of the jungle 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.740
 but not only the playing experience makes 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.690
 a step forward but also 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.790
 we with our clear before still in the 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.490
 national space under the esl 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:01.470
 On the way we expanded and so to speak 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.190
 then took league games of the Klamm base 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.750
 league part 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.820
 here we were in one 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.490
 international league and met 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.110
 on teams from across europe over strong 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.600
 especially the polish teams out 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.550
 and always delivered us 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.500
 action-packed match like me the time 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.030
 missed in which still foils on the 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.640
 were glued to the screen 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.260
 pixel exactly over the entire map 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.240
 shoot the entrance of a house 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.560
 can therefore be strategically important 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.390
 to hold flag points 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.370
 There were really many drastic ones 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.260
 experiences and even if I have this time 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.150
 fell claim and due 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.040
 youthful carelessness also the school 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.990
 i was suffering from it this time 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.430
 do not want to turn back together with 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.289
 the sound of colleagues in july 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.910
 transport helicopter to sit and with 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:43.830
 researching numbers of creedence 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.280
 clearwater revival in the battle too 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.160
 pull 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.200
 just an epic moment in too 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.570
 this profession successor was our team 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.669
 remixed again so merged 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.590
 part of another clan with us and 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:57.450
 also our original clear name became 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.640
 because of sponsor contracts that a 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:01.320
 or other times adapted as bad 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.880
 has become really good the one or the other 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.890
 another cup and placed among the 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.020
 top 3 of the international profi ts 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.789
 name clear league today terrible 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.770
 Often in remembrance what this bello 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:12.870
 as part of which for me with 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.639
 one of the best, if not the best 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.680
 heard part of the franchise 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:18.180
 and it has this honor there was still one 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.249
 first clear yes from the frame of 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.349
 Collective claims osnabrÃ¼ck we could 

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:24.090
 this 1200 gamer big load with two 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:26.099
 Teams compete and took place in Vietnam 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:28.110
 cup also the first and second rank 

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:29.879
 but this whole thing happened to me 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.560
 Of course only in the background because it 

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:33.509
 was primarily about the people 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.370
 You have been in the area for several years 

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:37.020
 ear also personally had the hand 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.939
 to shake and to him for example too 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.129
 Show me how I am with my obsolete 

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:43.199
 computer and a jerky game the 

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:45.680
 Nevertheless, the ass are powerful 

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:45.680
 could rip
