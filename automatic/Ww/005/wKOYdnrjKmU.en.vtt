00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.390
 no 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:07.430
 [Music] 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:10.460
 I start his part pushed back my 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.280
 cuticles with a stick on nails 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.270
 natural 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.460
 [Music] 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:22.270
 then I read my nails all over the 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:26.200
 surface to long with a block and by 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:28.250
 after that I read me ghlin house and I 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:35.610
 make a good length 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:38.050
 [Music] 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.089
 when I finished my preparation I 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:45.339
 dust just with a 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:48.549
 brush now i'm going to choose my 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:52.600
 capsule these are curved and are 

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:55.900
 so easier to use I choose a 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:01:00.040
 so a capsule adapted to the size of 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:02.589
 the nail and it's better to be it 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.019
 greater than three small than a ya 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:12.310
 always the possibility of rectifying 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:15.340
 after when you have found the right 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:19.390
 capsule then just ask the 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.820
 stick on the aventin and there you ask 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.650
 your capsule on your nail and well 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:39.590
 safe without air bubbles 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:42.600
 [Music] 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.350
 then cut yourself to the next choose 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:53.769
 with a guillotine 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:53.769
 [Music] 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:04.880
 then you like it the capsule for 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:07.219
 get a pretty shape now it's 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.090
 the most delicate it will have to limay the 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:12.960
 capsule for a natural rendering 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:39.209
 without touching the natural nail 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:39.209
 [Music] 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:51.060
 [Music] 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:54.740
 you finish all that with a block and the 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.290
 rendering must be really natural 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:00.690
 [Music] 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.480
 then when you're done well 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:08.600
 dust off with the mosson you spend 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:11.780
 a thin base layer especially the nail 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.780
 [Music] 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.260
 and catalyze you and two minutes on the 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:30.940
 uv lamp 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:34.190
 [Music] 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:37.520
 now I apply a color gel 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:46.240
 white to achieve a beautiful french 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:48.200
 [Music] 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.180

 [Music] 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.769
 and I catalyze two minutes 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:01.900
 I apply a thin layer of 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:04.610
 construction especially my nail without 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:12.509
 touch the cuticles 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:12.509
 [Music] 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.680
 I'm now applying my construction in 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.970
 making a ball for it to be 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:29.910
 really very solid and I put a little 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:52.769
 from everywhere especially English 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:52.769
 [Music] 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:59.400
 once I finish I catalyze 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:02.710
 two minutes 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:08.650
 now just remove the layer 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:10.960
 glue with a kiener we come to 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:14.160
 the stage where they craze but to get 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.160

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.849
 [Applause] 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:35.969
 then do not forget to 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:39.360
 dust off and I end up applying 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:41.010
 a thin layer of finish and I 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:45.120
 catalyzes two minutes 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:47.120
 [Music] 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.120

 and here I am not finishing off the 

00:05:57.589 --> 00:06:01.389
 layer of glue with a cleaner 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:03.919
 m 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:10.060
