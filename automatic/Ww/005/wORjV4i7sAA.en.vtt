00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
straight out from that barrier and

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.570 
straight out from that barrier and
basically<00:00:25.470> what<00:00:25.710> we're<00:00:25.920> going<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.220> use<00:00:26.340> sim

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
basically what we're going to use sim

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.310 
basically what we're going to use sim
for<00:00:26.760> is<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.150> course<00:00:27.300> break<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.630> barrier<00:00:27.960> which

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320

for is of course break a barrier which
is<00:00:28.439> located<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.849> think<00:00:30.150> it's<00:00:30.330> called<00:00:30.599> a

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
is located and I think it's called a

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.810 
is located and I think it's called a
gunsmith<00:00:31.199> shop<00:00:31.260> which<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.099> right<00:00:32.399> here<00:00:32.430> as<00:00:32.700> you

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
gunsmith shop which is right here as you

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.790 
gunsmith shop which is right here as you
can<00:00:32.880> see<00:00:33.149> on<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.420> screen<00:00:33.570> now<00:00:33.930> basically<00:00:34.500> what

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
can see on the screen now basically what

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.020 
can see on the screen now basically what
you<00:00:34.890> gotta<00:00:35.040> do<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.219> just<00:00:35.430> give<00:00:35.610> him<00:00:35.730> some<00:00:35.760> booze

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
so that he can of course break the

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.709 
so that he can of course break the
barrier<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.820> in<00:00:38.969> there<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.360> will<00:00:39.480> actually

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
barrier and in there you will actually

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.170 
barrier and in there you will actually

points<00:01:16.740> now<00:01:17.520> i<00:01:17.549> think<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:18.450> they're<00:01:18.570> only<00:01:18.750> a

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
points now i think that they're only a

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.140 
points now i think that they're only a
couple<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.860> ?<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.820> can<00:01:20.970> reach

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
couple of this ? that you can reach

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.170 
couple of this ? that you can reach
without<00:01:21.420> unlocking<00:01:21.840> any<00:01:22.110> barriers<00:01:22.790> so<00:01:23.790> as<00:01:24.150> you

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
without unlocking any barriers so as you

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.429 
without unlocking any barriers so as you
can<00:01:24.360> see<00:01:24.540> right<00:01:24.570> there<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:25.049> described<00:01:25.409> the
