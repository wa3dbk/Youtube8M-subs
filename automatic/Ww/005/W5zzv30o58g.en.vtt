takes in order to do this big dynamic
event<00:02:55.440> thing<00:02:55.680> just<00:02:56.040> so<00:02:56.160> it<00:02:56.310> looks<00:02:56.520> awesome<00:02:56.730> but

and kills on to that was a map with the

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 
step back and in battlefield 4 I think

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.270 
step back and in battlefield 4 I think
it's<00:06:09.960> actually<00:06:10.110> improved<00:06:10.620> quite<00:06:10.830> a<00:06:10.890> bit<00:06:10.980> with

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 
it's actually improved quite a bit with

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.580 
it's actually improved quite a bit with
the<00:06:11.400> maps<00:06:11.790> that<00:06:12.030> actually<00:06:12.450> have<00:06:12.630> little<00:06:13.080> sort

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
the maps that actually have little sort

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.800 
the maps that actually have little sort
of<00:06:13.680> detached<00:06:14.100> buildings<00:06:14.760> they<00:06:15.330> fall<00:06:15.600> down

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:15.810 
of detached buildings they fall down

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.600 
of detached buildings they fall down
quite<00:06:16.350> often<00:06:16.530> quail<00:06:16.919> or<00:06:16.950> other<00:06:17.340> words<00:06:17.460> can

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
quite often quail or other words can

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:18.439 
quite often quail or other words can
actually<00:06:17.910> get<00:06:18.030> more

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:18.449 
actually get more

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:20.959 
actually get more
completely<00:06:19.050> but<00:06:19.740> and<00:06:20.039> maps<00:06:20.490> like<00:06:20.729> the<00:06:20.819> one

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:20.969 
completely but and maps like the one

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:22.159 
completely but and maps like the one
that<00:06:21.059> I'm<00:06:21.210> playing<00:06:21.449> on<00:06:21.599> just<00:06:21.809> here<00:06:21.960> which<00:06:22.080> is

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:22.169 
that I'm playing on just here which is

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:23.839 
that I'm playing on just here which is
flood<00:06:22.439> zone<00:06:22.680> you<00:06:22.860> can't<00:06:23.069> destroy<00:06:23.370> anything

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:23.849 
flood zone you can't destroy anything

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:26.089 
flood zone you can't destroy anything
except<00:06:24.629> for<00:06:24.809> a<00:06:24.840> little<00:06:25.229> shacks<00:06:25.529> and<00:06:25.770> stuff

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:26.099 
except for a little shacks and stuff

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:28.399 
except for a little shacks and stuff
like<00:06:26.249> that<00:06:26.309> you<00:06:26.939> can't<00:06:27.089> actually<00:06:27.330> blow<00:06:27.900> up<00:06:28.110> any

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:28.409 
like that you can't actually blow up any

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:30.200 
like that you can't actually blow up any
whole<00:06:29.039> buildings<00:06:29.580> because<00:06:29.879> they're<00:06:30.089> all

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 
whole buildings because they're all

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.239 
whole buildings because they're all
attached<00:06:30.569> and<00:06:30.839> that<00:06:31.199> would<00:06:31.349> make<00:06:31.620> no<00:06:31.650> sense<00:06:31.919> of

00:06:32.239 --> 00:06:32.249 
attached and that would make no sense of

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:34.760 
attached and that would make no sense of
it<00:06:32.339> kind<00:06:32.430> of<00:06:32.520> break<00:06:32.819> the<00:06:32.999> map<00:06:33.180> sleep<00:06:33.539> but<00:06:34.499> I<00:06:34.680> do

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:34.770 
it kind of break the map sleep but I do

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.309 
it kind of break the map sleep but I do
feel<00:06:35.219> that<00:06:35.279> in<00:06:35.699> the<00:06:35.849> future<00:06:36.089> they<00:06:36.930> are<00:06:37.080> going

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:37.319 
feel that in the future they are going

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:39.079 
feel that in the future they are going
to<00:06:37.379> again<00:06:37.740> and<00:06:38.009> improve<00:06:38.339> all<00:06:38.580> the<00:06:38.729> destruction

00:06:39.079 --> 00:06:39.089 
to again and improve all the destruction

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:42.290 
to again and improve all the destruction
and<00:06:39.599> even<00:06:40.469> bigger<00:06:40.710> buildings<00:06:41.309> because<00:06:41.999> I<00:06:42.150> feel

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300 
and even bigger buildings because I feel

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.790 
and even bigger buildings because I feel
that<00:06:42.330> the<00:06:42.569> way<00:06:42.689> that<00:06:42.930> I<00:06:42.990> feel<00:06:43.349> one<00:06:43.650> of<00:06:43.740> the

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 
that the way that I feel one of the

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.459 
that the way that I feel one of the
things<00:06:44.009> that's<00:06:44.099> actually<00:06:44.430> holding<00:06:44.879> back

00:06:45.459 --> 00:06:45.469 
things that's actually holding back

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:48.860 
things that's actually holding back
improving<00:06:46.469> destruction<00:06:47.279> as<00:06:47.490> the<00:06:48.479> fact<00:06:48.719> that

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:48.870 
improving destruction as the fact that

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.140 
improving destruction as the fact that
they've<00:06:49.439> been<00:06:49.469> making<00:06:49.800> these<00:06:50.129> games<00:06:50.430> on<00:06:50.759> the

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.150 
they've been making these games on the

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.239 
they've been making these games on the
older<00:06:51.629> consoles<00:06:52.139> which<00:06:52.439> hardware<00:06:53.009> doesn't

00:06:53.239 --> 00:06:53.249 
older consoles which hardware doesn't

00:06:53.249 --> 00:06:55.219 
older consoles which hardware doesn't
really<00:06:53.550> support<00:06:53.849> the<00:06:54.150> game<00:06:54.389> as<00:06:54.539> it<00:06:54.719> is<00:06:54.839> never

00:06:55.219 --> 00:06:55.229 
really support the game as it is never

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:58.339 
really support the game as it is never
mind<00:06:55.849> when<00:06:56.849> they<00:06:57.029> add<00:06:57.180> more<00:06:57.449> to<00:06:57.719> it<00:06:57.749> then<00:06:58.080> they

00:06:58.339 --> 00:06:58.349 
mind when they add more to it then they

00:06:58.349 --> 00:07:00.499 
mind when they add more to it then they
do<00:06:58.800> support<00:06:59.129> the<00:06:59.249> game<00:06:59.370> as<00:06:59.520> I<00:06:59.999> don't<00:07:00.180> want<00:07:00.360> that

00:07:00.499 --> 00:07:00.509 
do support the game as I don't want that

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:03.469 
do support the game as I don't want that
correctly<00:07:00.960> there<00:07:01.229> but<00:07:01.830> not<00:07:02.639> as<00:07:02.909> it<00:07:03.330> doesn't

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:03.479 
correctly there but not as it doesn't

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:05.659 
correctly there but not as it doesn't
run<00:07:03.659> a<00:07:03.689> smooth<00:07:04.020> it<00:07:04.409> yeah<00:07:05.069> I<00:07:05.099> feel<00:07:05.430> that<00:07:05.580> they

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:05.669 
run a smooth it yeah I feel that they

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:07.129 
run a smooth it yeah I feel that they
are<00:07:05.699> slightly<00:07:06.060> holding<00:07:06.449> them<00:07:06.539> back<00:07:06.569> a<00:07:06.749> lot<00:07:06.990> but

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:07.139 
are slightly holding them back a lot but

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:08.929 
are slightly holding them back a lot but
I<00:07:07.199> feel<00:07:07.409> once<00:07:07.800> we<00:07:07.919> move<00:07:08.069> into<00:07:08.219> the<00:07:08.400> next<00:07:08.520> gen<00:07:08.819> of

00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:08.939 
I feel once we move into the next gen of

00:07:08.939 --> 00:07:11.929 
I feel once we move into the next gen of
consoles<00:07:09.360> and<00:07:10.249> everyone's<00:07:11.249> up<00:07:11.460> to<00:07:11.490> speed<00:07:11.669> on

00:07:11.929 --> 00:07:11.939 
consoles and everyone's up to speed on

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:13.999 
consoles and everyone's up to speed on
how<00:07:12.270> to<00:07:12.330> you<00:07:12.689> know<00:07:12.719> every<00:07:13.050> game<00:07:13.199> can<00:07:13.409> run<00:07:13.680> just

00:07:13.999 --> 00:07:14.009 
how to you know every game can run just

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:16.189 
how to you know every game can run just
as<00:07:14.099> well<00:07:14.310> on<00:07:14.339> any<00:07:14.699> platform<00:07:14.999> then<00:07:15.719> I<00:07:15.839> feel<00:07:16.020> that

00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:16.199 
as well on any platform then I feel that

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:17.329 
as well on any platform then I feel that
they're<00:07:16.349> really<00:07:16.499> going<00:07:16.740> to<00:07:16.830> improve

00:07:17.329 --> 00:07:17.339 
they're really going to improve

00:07:17.339 --> 00:07:19.279 
they're really going to improve
drastically<00:07:17.870> they're<00:07:18.870> different

00:07:19.279 --> 00:07:19.289 
drastically they're different

00:07:19.289 --> 00:07:20.899 
drastically they're different
destruction<00:07:19.740> abilities<00:07:20.159> and<00:07:20.370> the<00:07:20.520> game<00:07:20.699> like

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:20.909 
destruction abilities and the game like

00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:22.969 
destruction abilities and the game like
taking<00:07:21.180> down<00:07:21.330> full<00:07:21.659> buildings<00:07:22.259> and<00:07:22.680> all<00:07:22.800> that
