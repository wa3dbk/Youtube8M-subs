00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
w 21 B which is 1.8 related and I want

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.480 
w 21 B which is 1.8 related and I want
to<00:00:18.869> show<00:00:19.020> you<00:00:19.080> an<00:00:19.260> x-ray<00:00:19.590> device<00:00:19.830> which<00:00:20.310> I

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
to show you an x-ray device which I

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.519 
to show you an x-ray device which I
didn't<00:00:21.000> found<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.390> think<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:21.900> was<00:00:22.080> found<00:00:22.320> by<00:00:22.470> the

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
didn't found I think it was found by the

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.410 
didn't found I think it was found by the
zipcode<00:00:22.890> guys<00:00:23.310> but<00:00:23.880> they<00:00:24.029> didn't<00:00:24.269> really

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
zipcode guys but they didn't really

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.970 
zipcode guys but they didn't really
address<00:00:24.840> it<00:00:24.869> so<00:00:25.140> I<00:00:25.170> wanted<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.769> make<00:00:25.949> a

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
address it so I wanted to make a

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.550 
address it so I wanted to make a
separate<00:00:26.490> video<00:00:26.789> about<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:27.330> alright<00:00:28.109> so<00:00:28.380> what

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
separate video about it alright so what

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.279 
separate video about it alright so what
you<00:00:28.590> can<00:00:28.859> see<00:00:29.010> right<00:00:29.250> here<00:00:29.279> right<00:00:30.150> now<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.630> a

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
you can see right here right now is a

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.639 
you can see right here right now is a
minecart<00:00:31.859> in<00:00:32.130> X<00:00:32.550> rayed<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:33.270> how<00:00:34.050> did<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.350> do<00:00:34.500> that

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
minecart in X rayed so how did I do that

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.010 
minecart in X rayed so how did I do that
it's<00:00:35.190> pretty<00:00:35.460> simple<00:00:35.940> it's<00:00:36.210> working<00:00:36.719> again

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
it's pretty simple it's working again

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.810 
it's pretty simple it's working again
and<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.380> funny<00:00:37.559> thing<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.640> is

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
and the funny thing is that it is

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.819 
and the funny thing is that it is
working<00:00:39.360> with<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.750> same<00:00:39.960> things<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.500> worked

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
working with the same things it worked

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.670 
working with the same things it worked
in<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.160> beginning<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:42.030> what<00:00:42.450> do<00:00:42.899> we<00:00:42.960> have<00:00:43.110> here

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
in the beginning so what do we have here

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.619 
in the beginning so what do we have here
this<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.100> Jung<00:00:44.550> leaves<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:45.000> could<00:00:45.149> also<00:00:45.300> use

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
this is Jung leaves you could also use

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.690 
this is Jung leaves you could also use
any<00:00:45.660> other<00:00:46.050> type<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.410> leaves<00:00:46.770> doesn't<00:00:47.550> really

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
any other type of leaves doesn't really

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.970 
any other type of leaves doesn't really
matter<00:00:47.969> we<00:00:48.539> could<00:00:48.690> also<00:00:48.870> use<00:00:49.050> spruce<00:00:49.620> leaves

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
matter we could also use spruce leaves

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.180 
matter we could also use spruce leaves
and<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:51.120> would<00:00:51.360> do<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.899> same<00:00:52.110> effect<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:53.039> now

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
and it would do the same effect and now

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.459 
and it would do the same effect and now
my<00:00:53.430> night<00:00:53.640> vision<00:00:54.000> ran<00:00:54.180> out<00:00:54.360> that's<00:00:54.870> important

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
my night vision ran out that's important

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.010 
my night vision ran out that's important
to<00:00:55.590> have<00:00:56.340> when<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:56.969> want<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.329> find<00:00:57.539> tangents

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
to have when you want to find tangents

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.080 
to have when you want to find tangents
or<00:00:58.140> something<00:00:58.500> it's<00:00:58.680> just<00:00:58.949> easier<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.460> then

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
or something it's just easier and then

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.460 
or something it's just easier and then
you<00:01:00.180> can<00:01:00.390> just<00:01:00.570> look<00:01:00.930> around<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.680> search<00:01:02.520> for

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
you can just look around and search for

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.730 
you can just look around and search for
some<00:01:05.240> rectangles<00:01:06.240> sort<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:07.020> rectangles

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
some rectangles sort of rectangles

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
some rectangles sort of rectangles
squares<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:09.590> you'll<00:01:10.590> eventually<00:01:10.920> find<00:01:11.460> them

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
squares and you'll eventually find them

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.310 
squares and you'll eventually find them
it's<00:01:11.939> pretty<00:01:12.119> hard<00:01:12.450> with<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.869> new<00:01:13.020> blocks

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
it's pretty hard with the new blocks

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.760 
it's pretty hard with the new blocks
which<00:01:13.860> look<00:01:14.340> like<00:01:14.369> cobblestone<00:01:15.470> but<00:01:16.470> you

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
which look like cobblestone but you

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.330 
which look like cobblestone but you
should<00:01:17.070> not<00:01:17.580> be<00:01:18.000> having<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.960> big<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.409> trouble

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
should not be having that big of trouble

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.460 
should not be having that big of trouble
with<00:01:20.580> finding<00:01:21.150> tangents<00:01:21.570> but<00:01:21.930> if<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.170> want<00:01:22.380> to

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
with finding tangents but if you want to

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.170 
with finding tangents but if you want to
know<00:01:22.619> how<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.920> find<00:01:23.280> dungeons<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:23.820> can<00:01:24.000> check

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
know how to find dungeons you can check

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.969 
know how to find dungeons you can check
out<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.450> video<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.049> description<00:01:25.259> or<00:01:25.680> the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
out the video in the description or the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.920 
out the video in the description or the
annotation<00:01:26.460> which<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.119> at<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.450> end<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.780> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
annotation which is at the end of the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.440 
annotation which is at the end of the
video<00:01:28.170> but<00:01:28.500> anyway<00:01:28.650> how<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.640> can<00:01:29.909> do<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.270> as

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
video but anyway how you can do that as

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.719 
video but anyway how you can do that as
you<00:01:30.509> can<00:01:30.869> see<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.259> leaf<00:01:31.770> then<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.310> track

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
you can see a leaf then a track

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.760 
you can see a leaf then a track
underneath<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.860> mm<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:35.780> track<00:01:36.780> underneath<00:01:37.409> a

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
underneath a mm a track underneath a

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.609 
underneath a mm a track underneath a
minecart<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.720> the<00:01:39.720> thing<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.380> got<00:01:40.590> to

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
minecart and the thing you got to

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.679 
minecart and the thing you got to
remember<00:01:40.799> is<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.700> need<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:41.909> go<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.180> video

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
remember is you need to go to video

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.710 
remember is you need to go to video
settings<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.350> then<00:01:43.740> graphics<00:01:44.399> fast<00:01:45.149> you

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
settings and then graphics fast you

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.200 
settings and then graphics fast you
cannot<00:01:46.049> do<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.380> in<00:01:46.740> fancy<00:01:47.159> because<00:01:47.340> the

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
cannot do that in fancy because the

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.600 
cannot do that in fancy because the
leave<00:01:48.450> kind<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.079> has<00:01:49.259> this<00:01:49.560> transparency<00:01:50.280> and

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
leave kind of has this transparency and

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.999 
leave kind of has this transparency and
then<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.090> won't<00:01:51.329> do<00:01:51.570> nothing<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.439> let's

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
then it won't do nothing and let's

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.350 
then it won't do nothing and let's
actually<00:01:53.280> go<00:01:53.759> into<00:01:53.909> game-mode<00:01:54.570> 0<00:01:56.060> so<00:01:57.060> we<00:01:57.210> can

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
actually go into game-mode 0 so we can

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.060 
actually go into game-mode 0 so we can
check<00:01:57.509> this<00:01:57.719> out<00:01:57.960> this<00:01:58.290> won't<00:01:58.590> give<00:01:58.770> us<00:01:58.890> any

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
check this out this won't give us any

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.700 
check this out this won't give us any
suffocation<00:01:59.790> damage<00:01:59.909> only<00:02:00.479> when<00:02:01.229> we<00:02:01.350> jump<00:02:01.619> out

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
suffocation damage only when we jump out

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.160 
suffocation damage only when we jump out
into<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.430> stone<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.820> course<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.299> let's<00:02:03.960> try

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
into the stone of course and let's try

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.270 
into the stone of course and let's try
this<00:02:04.229> out<00:02:04.530> on<00:02:04.680> fast<00:02:04.979> again<00:02:05.420> Punk<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.829> we<00:02:07.829> don't

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
this out on fast again Punk and we don't

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.130 
this out on fast again Punk and we don't
get<00:02:08.640> damaged<00:02:09.030> while<00:02:09.239> we're<00:02:09.450> sitting<00:02:09.750> in<00:02:09.869> here
