00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.600
 gives to others all the rights that 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.940

 zaida patricia the city coordinator

 university with culture sense of

 belonging and quality 

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:27.079
 friends city then as a 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:29.240
 proposal for improvement of 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:31.520
 university relations and the 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.320
 university experience had to be 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.789
 apply a diagnosis in all 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.710
 faculties of the university for 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:38.409
 get as main points of 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.090
 intervention two fundamental problems 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.590
 the first of them has to do with the 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.270
 interaction that you are establishing 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.310
 our students the way 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.530
 relate and how because of 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.140
 multiculturalism many times we fall 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.210
 disrespect in intolerance and in the 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.920
 aggression another fundamental factor that 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.979
 constitutes one of the main focuses 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.599
 of intervention has to do with the 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.849
 use and good use of the 

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:04.039
 spaces about everything that has to do 

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:05.599
 with classrooms with the use of 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.369
 coffee shops so we can 

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:09.649
 keep our university clean and 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.420
 nice and also recognize the value 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.709
 fundamental that has the staff that the 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.310
 now inside our facilities 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.540
 by thinking in this way to build 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.459
 our friend city project 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.530
 It will involve putting me in the shoes of the 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.450
 another and change my de facto attitude to the 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.640
 citizen culture is precisely a 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.239
 question of positive attitude towards everything 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.239
 what surrounds us 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.860
 within the challenges and expectations 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.900
 raised is strengthens respect for 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.280
 diversity the proper management of 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.439
 free time and the achievement of a 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.390
 harmonious coexistence all this for 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:44.590
 contribute to the integral formation of the 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.590
 Amigonian community 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.910
 two fundamental objectives are those 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.710
 we try to achieve with friendly city the 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.360
 first of them is to qualify the 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.190
 interactions that we have the 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.160
 administrative and teaching students 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.480
 in such a way that we not only come to 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.240
 acquire knowledge but also 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.760
 let's strengthen that relational part from 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.780
 three basic articulations ethics the 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.780
 social norm and culture
