and it'll end all that then you can lock
your<00:03:12.410> screen<00:03:12.590> rotation<00:03:13.160> on<00:03:13.460> the<00:03:13.580> right<00:03:13.790> there

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
your screen rotation on the right there

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.310 
your screen rotation on the right there
that<00:03:14.780> is<00:03:15.050> pretty<00:03:15.380> much<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:15.740> control<00:03:16.400> center

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
that is pretty much the control center

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.010 
that is pretty much the control center
so<00:03:18.320> if<00:03:18.710> we<00:03:19.460> did<00:03:19.640> not<00:03:19.880> have<00:03:20.180> the<00:03:20.330> control<00:03:20.690> center

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
so if we did not have the control center

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.170 
so if we did not have the control center
we<00:03:21.740> would<00:03:21.950> have<00:03:21.980> to<00:03:22.160> go<00:03:22.340> to<00:03:22.400> settings<00:03:22.850> and<00:03:23.060> we

we would have to go to settings and we

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.520 
we would have to go to settings and we
would<00:03:23.330> have<00:03:23.450> to<00:03:23.570> go<00:03:23.690> to<00:03:23.750> all<00:03:23.960> of<00:03:23.990> these<00:03:24.320> areas

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
would have to go to all of these areas

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.460

we'd have to go to bluetooth turn it off

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.850 
we'd have to go to bluetooth turn it off
