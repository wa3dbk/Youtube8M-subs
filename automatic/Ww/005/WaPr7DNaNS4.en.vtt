00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
team to develop let's say Kobe was

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.870 
team to develop let's say Kobe was
traded<00:01:03.629> where's<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.260> likely<00:01:04.559> destination

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
traded where's the likely destination

Chicago<00:01:05.880> looks<00:01:06.150> awfully<00:01:06.720> good<00:01:06.750> simply

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
Chicago looks awfully good simply

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.770 
Chicago looks awfully good simply
because<00:01:07.830> they<00:01:08.070> have<00:01:08.280> enough<00:01:08.549> young<00:01:08.909> talent<00:01:09.630> to

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
because they have enough young talent to

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.660 
because they have enough young talent to
trade<00:01:10.170> where<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.619> Lakers<00:01:10.830> could<00:01:11.220> get<00:01:11.400> some

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
trade where the Lakers could get some

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.820 
trade where the Lakers could get some
pieces<00:01:11.909> back<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.960> would<00:01:13.110> allow<00:01:13.409> them<00:01:13.770> to

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
pieces back that would allow them to

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.560 
pieces back that would allow them to
rebuild<00:01:14.220> on<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.909> pace<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.180> they're

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
rebuild on the pace that they're

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.390 
rebuild on the pace that they're
currently<00:01:15.810> going<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.439> at<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.830> same<00:01:17.100> time

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
currently going and at the same time

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.580 
currently going and at the same time
there<00:01:17.909> would<00:01:18.000> be<00:01:18.060> enough<00:01:18.450> pieces<00:01:18.659> left<00:01:19.080> behind

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
there would be enough pieces left behind

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.770 
there would be enough pieces left behind
the<00:01:20.159> Kobe<00:01:20.520> could<00:01:20.670> actually<00:01:20.820> compete<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.570> the
