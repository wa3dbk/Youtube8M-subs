00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:12.960
 natural remedies are principals 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.780
 natural non-pharmacological than this 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.150
 general definition 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.859
 include a series of products that 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.949
 refer to the world of nature 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:27.060
 then herbal supplements vitamins 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.140
 bach flower minerals that serve as 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.460
 say in 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.040
 side by side or in many times also in 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.980
 more product replacement 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.140
 pharmacological and more medical to increase 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.910
 the chance of a person's well-being 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.070
 personally a particular need on 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.280
 natural medicines the disciplines 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:50.659
 natural natural products that I find that 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.579
 suffer from a methodological error and a 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:55.010
 error of approach I see at least in the 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.690
 my experience that there are people who 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.489
 I am absolutely closed with regard to 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.409
 of these products 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.409
 in particular the representatives of 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:05.210
 pharmacological world many old doctors 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.880
 style that I heard with my ears 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.729
 of reano the herbs are just fine 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.009
 in the garden this is a mistake because it wants to 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.170
 say to be out of science exist 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:17.810
 hundreds if not thousands of studies 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.229
 available on the databases 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.689
 of scientific publications in which yes 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:26.030
 the effects of the benefits of 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.250
 lots of herbs to talk only about herbs 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.720
 of physiotherapy herbal medicine for 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.659
 however, there is another approach that 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.090
 I like it even less and it is often widespread 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.979
 among the sector operators and who is who 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.229
 instead he believes that with the disciplines 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.429
 natural techniques and remedies can 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:45.229
 arrive always and everywhere and therefore 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:48.619
 replace almost desu al i principals 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.689
 pharmacological with herbs minerals 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.850
 I think it's a very strong mistake and 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:53.450
 with strong character setting 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.850
 ideological 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.340
 I am happy to live in a 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.679
 world even if I am a naturopath where 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.359
 antibiotics are available where it is 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:05.049
 where surgery was available 

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:07.130
 First aid treatment available 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:10.100
 what perhaps the most approach 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.930
 it is reasonable to understand when instead of 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.340
 then resort to certain bombs 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.530
 drugs that perhaps less started with 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.540
 too much ease is possible instead 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.030
 feel better as a series of very remedies 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.740
 sweeter here are the natural remedies 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.390
 coming from the world of nature 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.150
 very often each of us can 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.800
 use in absolute safety day 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.270
 per day to remove as much as possible 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.220
 possible the risk of resorting to 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.670
 drugs and surgical procedures ea 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.709
 anything else strong difference between 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.940
 of doctors in the disciplines and health 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.190
 natural call this whole sector 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.260
 which goes from ayurveda to homeopathy 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.500
 phytotherapy, you name it 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.530
 compared to classical medicine is the role 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.330
 of active subject of the person you are 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.950
 recurs that it is very different compared 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.489
 to the approach towards 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.760
 medicine 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.920
 I broke my stomach on something 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.350
 liver the knee and go to the doctor 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.130
 who fixes me with the magic pill in 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:06.560
 natural environment in the naturopathic field 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.930
 the role of the person becomes central 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.830
 the subject is the first and the most 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.720
 important medical himself styles 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.190
 life feeding physical activity such as 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.799
 we use our head natural remedies 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.299
 that we can take daily 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.610
 to get better are those who do 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:25.430
 they make you feel good even in the long run 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:29.030
 well then that time when not 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.340
 we can say to be comfortable with everyone 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.489
 then these principals we have to resort to 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.130
 mark drugs we reduce by 90 percent 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.840
 the need to use products 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.940
 like the pharmacological ones they have 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.940
 also a number of side effects 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.940
 important
