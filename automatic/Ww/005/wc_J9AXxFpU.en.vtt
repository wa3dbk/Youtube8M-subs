00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.210
 good afternoon my dear viewers 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.309
 channel today would like to show you 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:11.639
 small improvements that I 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.460
 introduced in the opener hall to force JK 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.150
 that is, the coffin neff this knife to me 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.150
 relatively recently appeared but I 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.630
 will arise here to do specifically such 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:26.970
 bushcraft tyr such a knife completely 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.219
 sharpen it just for some forest 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:34.200
 tasks are not for this purpose I did this 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:37.680
 first of all I made a hole like this 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.100
 But under the lanyard just drilled such 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.820
 hole 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.309
 through shank blade enters 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.530
 about here 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:51.000
 it is with us so there is no risk 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.600
 hook the metal it is shown there 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.070
 may be 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:00.600
 approximate value further except here 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.059
 this paracord hole 550 more 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.519
 there was a hole in the garda here 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.080
 here is such 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:11.220
 maybe it was not very good 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.110
 so rude but why was it made for 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.680
 In order to, if necessary, you can 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:20.729
 had a paracord and here too 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:23.580
 make such a kind of power for the hand 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.689
 on the loop, I don’t know how it will show 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:31.320
 themselves, in fact that is it was clean 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:34.439
 done as an experiment I don't know 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.140
 how it will be practical or not think you 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:41.130
 can speak in the comments for 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:45.930
 or against here is such a hole 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:51.630
 that is, such a hole here 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:54.510
 that is, here is such a lanyard 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:02:03.180
 ordinary piece of paracord without any 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:04.970
 tangles I was already a little to take a knife 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.119
 regretted for this time 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.560
 I would also like to add this 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:17.400
 knife call the force 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:20.489
 Grof refers to them but as I wrote 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.920
 user aizenwinter in the comments 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.280
 under video how to force boxes in ji 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.570
 Kay 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.580
 my video review he's there minus that this knife 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.440
 refers to melee weapons that is in 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.239
 sets of parameters for some 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.739
 power parameters and wired weapons 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:41.239
 I don’t know if this is true or not, but I would 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:44.459
 I wanted to warn everyone about this fact 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:47.730
 Here I hope my such review was you 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:51.780
 useful and interesting leave 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.549
 comments and more likely my 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:58.790
 bushcraft tyr set this here 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:03:03.230
 flint will enter konce this flint and flint 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:06.239
 but I’m pretty pause for 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.610
 just along with this knife 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:12.660
 never used and most likely 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:14.989
 it will be part of a single such survived 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.910
 ie let's say the set 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:20.570
 oh well everyone thanks for watching up 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.570
 new meetings
