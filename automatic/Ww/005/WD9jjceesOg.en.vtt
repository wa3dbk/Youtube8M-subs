00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
so let's get started first team can

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.950 
so let's get started first team can
build<00:00:33.449> is<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.530> wall<00:00:34.879> the<00:00:35.879> wall<00:00:36.059> only<00:00:36.360> costs

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
build is the wall the wall only costs

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.310 
build is the wall the wall only costs
one<00:00:37.470> with<00:00:38.190> energy<00:00:38.760> or<00:00:39.120> watch<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.720> whatever<00:00:40.170> you

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
one with energy or watch it whatever you

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.130 
one with energy or watch it whatever you
guys<00:00:40.440> call<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.130> it's<00:00:41.910> pretty<00:00:42.180> useful<00:00:42.510> when

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
guys call it and it's pretty useful when

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.830 
guys call it and it's pretty useful when
you<00:00:43.290> guys<00:00:43.620> need<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:44.070> protect<00:00:44.460> something<00:00:44.840> for

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
you guys need to protect something for

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.630 
you guys need to protect something for
example<00:00:46.500> when<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.829> guys<00:00:47.100> are<00:00:47.340> playing

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
example when you guys are playing

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.540 
example when you guys are playing
capture<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.270> flag<00:00:48.800> if<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:49.950> guys<00:00:50.129> build<00:00:50.430> a

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
capture the flag if you guys build a

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.470 
capture the flag if you guys build a
wall<00:00:50.790> around<00:00:50.969> your<00:00:51.600> base<00:00:51.840> or<00:00:52.170> around<00:00:52.920> our<00:00:53.480> flag

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
wall around your base or around our flag

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.569 
wall around your base or around our flag
it<00:00:55.200> can<00:00:55.350> protect<00:00:55.649> their<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.760> next<00:00:57.180> item<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:57.989> the

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
it can protect their so next item is the

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.959 
it can protect their so next item is the
slight<00:00:59.579> bow<00:00:59.789> tower<00:01:00.379> so<00:01:01.379> this<00:01:02.100> sniper<00:01:02.340> travel

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
slight bow tower so this sniper travel

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.290 
slight bow tower so this sniper travel
costs<00:01:03.449> only<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:04.320> lift<00:01:04.710> energies<00:01:05.190> and<00:01:05.520> you<00:01:06.149> can

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
costs only to lift energies and you can

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.160 
costs only to lift energies and you can
pick<00:01:06.450> up<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.720> sniper<00:01:07.550> um<00:01:08.550> so<00:01:09.209> did<00:01:09.509> pretty<00:01:09.869> useful

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
pick up a sniper um so did pretty useful

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
making a manches but I don't see much

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.529 
making a manches but I don't see much
point<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.619> tab<00:01:16.860> will<00:01:17.100> feature<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.729> can<00:01:18.270> go

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:18.539

point of the tab will feature you can go
to<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.869> higher<00:01:19.289> level<00:01:19.670> from<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.700> enemy<00:01:21.179> but

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
to a higher level from the enemy but

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.199 
to a higher level from the enemy but
you're<00:01:22.140> putting<00:01:22.380> barney-boy<00:01:22.890> on<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.520> top<00:01:23.759> so

pretty nice so the next item HD go watch
so<00:01:35.399> you<00:01:35.940> can<00:01:36.179> build<00:01:36.770> jeeps<00:01:37.770> in<00:01:38.039> just<00:01:38.429> garage<00:01:38.670> so

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
so you can build jeeps in just garage so

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.150 
so you can build jeeps in just garage so
it's<00:01:39.420> pretty<00:01:39.630> useful<00:01:39.810> when<00:01:40.319> you<00:01:40.440> have<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.920> go

it's pretty useful when you have to go

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.240 
it's pretty useful when you have to go
around<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.759> base<00:01:42.200> so<00:01:43.200> when<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.890> guys<00:01:44.039> are

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
around the base so when you guys are

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.800 
around the base so when you guys are
playing<00:01:44.459> capture<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.910> flag<00:01:45.030> it's<00:01:45.599> pretty

00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:48.319 
useful for getting the flag and

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:50.749 
useful for getting the flag and
returning<00:01:49.319> the<00:01:49.500> flag<00:01:49.770> because<00:01:50.429> you<00:01:50.520> can<00:01:50.640> move

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
returning the flag because you can move

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.350 
returning the flag because you can move
back<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.209> the<00:01:51.360> enemy<00:01:52.009> next<00:01:53.009> item<00:01:53.160> is<00:01:53.429> the<00:01:53.670> auto

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
back to the enemy next item is the auto

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.800 
back to the enemy next item is the auto
to<00:01:54.660> it<00:01:54.810> um<00:01:55.440> and<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.550> only<00:01:56.700> caught<00:01:57.030> two<00:01:57.239> with<00:01:57.599> ten

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
to it um and it only caught two with ten

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.790 
to it um and it only caught two with ten
disease<00:01:58.170> for<00:01:59.130> my<00:01:59.310> taste<00:01:59.789> with<00:02:00.390> family<00:02:00.959> auto<00:02:01.380> to

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
disease for my taste with family auto to

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.339 
disease for my taste with family auto to
it<00:02:01.860> up<00:02:02.130> pretty<00:02:02.580> overpowered<00:02:03.140> compared<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.259> the

00:02:04.339 --> 00:02:04.349 
it up pretty overpowered compared to the

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:07.190 
it up pretty overpowered compared to the
others<00:02:04.880> it's<00:02:05.880> only<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.390> waste<00:02:06.630> energy<00:02:06.810> and

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
others it's only to waste energy and

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.859 
others it's only to waste energy and
which<00:02:07.410> really<00:02:07.619> powerful<00:02:08.479> next<00:02:09.479> one<00:02:09.660> is<00:02:09.840> the

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
which really powerful next one is the

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.130 
which really powerful next one is the
pause<00:02:10.800> something<00:02:11.400> i<00:02:11.610> forgot<00:02:11.640> name<00:02:12.270> but<00:02:12.629> you

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
pause something i forgot name but you

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.630 
pause something i forgot name but you
can<00:02:13.319> build<00:02:13.590> this<00:02:13.769> and<00:02:14.159> your

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
can build this and your

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.030 
can build this and your
Jim<00:02:14.760> can<00:02:15.000> spawn<00:02:15.330> honor<00:02:15.810> so<00:02:16.740> it's<00:02:16.920> pretty

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
Jim can spawn honor so it's pretty

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.820 
Jim can spawn honor so it's pretty
