00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.250 
Amman on it kind of whimsical and fun
but<00:00:54.140> the<00:00:54.260> idea<00:00:54.620> of<00:00:54.649> the<00:00:55.780> stopping<00:00:56.780> up<00:00:56.960> the<00:00:57.109> wine

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
but the idea of the stopping up the wine

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.079 
but the idea of the stopping up the wine
is<00:00:57.469> to<00:00:57.589> prevent<00:00:57.800> it<00:00:57.980> from<00:00:58.010> anything<00:00:58.789> falling

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 
is to prevent it from anything falling

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:00.340 
is to prevent it from anything falling
in<00:00:59.390> there<00:00:59.510> anything<00:00:59.809> getting<00:01:00.079> in<00:01:00.199> there

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
in there anything getting in there

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.579 
in there anything getting in there
overnight<00:01:01.120> to<00:01:02.120> reduce<00:01:02.420> any<00:01:02.629> particles<00:01:03.350> or

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
overnight to reduce any particles or

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:05.410 
overnight to reduce any particles or
little<00:01:04.250> bugs<00:01:04.460> that<00:01:04.580> might<00:01:04.729> be<00:01:04.879> flying<00:01:05.150> around

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
little bugs that might be flying around

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.310 
little bugs that might be flying around
just<00:01:06.200> to<00:01:06.290> go<00:01:06.440> ahead<00:01:06.530> and<00:01:06.740> stop<00:01:07.010> it<00:01:07.040> up<00:01:07.990> the<00:01:08.990> next

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
just to go ahead and stop it up the next

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.980 
just to go ahead and stop it up the next
day<00:01:09.530> I<00:01:09.830> would<00:01:10.610> either<00:01:10.850> consume<00:01:11.360> the<00:01:11.510> wine<00:01:11.659> or

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990
