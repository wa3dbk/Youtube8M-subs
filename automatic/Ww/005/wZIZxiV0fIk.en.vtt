00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:12.160
 but him then me in his life it's a 

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:14.170
 series that was born on the bbc that is 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.730
 in his fifth season it seems to me in this 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.980
 moment it's a series that had nothing 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.330
 to please in the sense that and not big 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.550
 name to his casting 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.439
 the pitch was not incredible either 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.730
 and yet today it is one of 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.199
 most watched series in the usa 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.240
 it's cool sometimes when there's something 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.890
 which is successful it launches a lot of 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.900
 new actors that makes us known 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.000
 full of new heads and that was the 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.860
 case with average family landed 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.640
 in this in this little family we do not 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.080
 knows nobody 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.820
 today we love them today 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.490
 it's big stars and we've known 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.050
 their ascent through this series and from 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.400
 trends and well here's navy series 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.780
 and we do not know anyone 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.490
 prevent falling in love with the 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.450
 series and that's what happens thanks to 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.920
 what happened in any case for my 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.560
 case with moneygram there is that you 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.930
 tell the story then as the title 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.850
 the indicated modern family modern family 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.530
 it tells the story of a family 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.600
 of today under names that is 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.049
 consisting of three groups in the 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.679
 family the family a little bit more 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.400
 traditional is the mom dad they 

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:12.440
 have two girls 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.990
 a little boy them and they are supposed to 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.550
 represent a model perhaps more 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.690
 cliche but it's healthy that it's 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.790
 interesting because even though 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.200
 the appearance this family is very very 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.320
 snapshot at the level of personalities 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.380
 level 2 who runs what in the house 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.980
 this is where the originality goes a little to 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.380
 to be put forward 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:33.860
 if we leave the mother of this family 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.530
 super clichés we have on the other side his 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.960
 father and who has just got married with a 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.430
 young Colombian woman who is very much 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.260
 a lot younger audience that I'm leaving 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.119
 sofia vergara which is a very very 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.860
 big icon today but who sees 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.360
 where we found out with our friend who 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.710
 has today become the actress the 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.450
 more paid television 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.710
 so it's pretty cool and a family 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.210
 recomposed since she already had a 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.100
 child of a first marriage all the 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.270
 world says he got himself to what 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.200
 lapse he is very very rich and she 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.880
 was married more than for your 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.869
 money we realize from the start 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.890
 that's not the case at all and it's 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.450
 a very very beautiful love story 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.670
 between the two the difference of 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.500
 generation has caused situations 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.780
 very funny and very very funny and 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.910
 it's a very very touching couple and 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.980
 the other side we always go back the 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.260
 father the girl who is in the family 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.010
 clichés and she has a brother who is 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.890
 homosexual 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.480
 with his partner cameron since very 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.690
 very long and at the beginning the series they 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.760
 have adopted a little girl at 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.890
 vietnam and come back to the united states 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.600
 with this little girl to start 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.640
 their new life of young parents with 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.070
 she and so that's it going to tell the 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.709
 stories of these two this great 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.480
 family is a little comedy how 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.519
 as we like them I want to say 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.470
 here we can ask an episode 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.750
 of modern blood family has reviewed the others 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.760
 always be funny it's always going to be 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.500
 touching I can not remember one 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.970
 bad episodes of mr family it's not 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.130
 no longer a series that will mark for life 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.660
 it's not the series where I'm an absolute fan 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.040
 the series has evolved quite 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.720
 interesting at the level of humor 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.040
 she was already funny at first but I 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.400
 meaning that it improves seasonally in 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.799
 season 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.660
 it's been two seasons since every episode 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.590
 I'm crying with laughter honestly at every 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.060
 Episode his characters cl 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.099
 readers are the masteries 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.660
 knows well and we really have fun with 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.459
 them now and it's up to you to laugh 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.590
 today monein family the form is 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.879
 so that was supposed to be original to 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.349
 the times now do it all but 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:17.849
 it's supposed to be a fake documentary 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.160
 so his movies and a little shoulder camera 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.510
 the camera is fidgeting all the time it's 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.330
 supposed to be finally a documentary about 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.470
 this family so camera shoulder them 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.569
 characters speak directly to the 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.560
 camera so there is behind camera of 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.330
 once they land in front of the camera 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.430
 as if he was in interview at 1e 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.080
 mockumentary we call that and it's 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.680
 like that my family filmed his 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.470
 addresses topics from current topics 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.640
 varied subjects he always approached 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.739
 with a lot of humor because his 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.940
 very very funny series but there are some 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.620
 very touching passages and she is 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.420
 gone to a little bit sad it's very 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.310
 soft and very soft and calm as a series 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.480
 it must have been already watched my soul 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.040
 family but if you do not do it 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.569
 you propose it in any case it's a 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.400
 very very good little series 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.140
 we feel good when we look at it we like 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.750
 all these characters we love them all 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.610
 the kids the older ones the 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.319
 parents the brothers the sisters it's 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.520
 really a super series we like them 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.500
 many both 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.730
 and that's really encouraging you to throw 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.420
 a look mena familiar to the 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.420
 watch from time to time
