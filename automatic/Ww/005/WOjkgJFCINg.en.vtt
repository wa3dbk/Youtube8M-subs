actually comes out so the only thing

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.319 
actually comes out so the only thing
that<00:00:50.129> they've<00:00:50.250> said<00:00:50.460> about<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.730> actual<00:00:50.940> Zelda

the<00:00:53.550> conventions<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.270> Zelda<00:00:54.629> games<00:00:54.809> like

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
the conventions of Zelda games like

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.830 
the conventions of Zelda games like
rather<00:00:55.920> than<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.640> basic<00:00:56.850> structure<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.570> it

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
rather than the basic structure of it

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.380 
rather than the basic structure of it
like<00:00:58.140> going<00:00:58.530> from<00:00:58.770> dungeon<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.460> dungeon<00:00:59.489> like

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
like going from dungeon to dungeon like

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.750 
like going from dungeon to dungeon like
in<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.629> son<00:01:00.870> order<00:01:01.399> like<00:01:02.399> even<00:01:02.640> though<00:01:02.699> you

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
in a son order like even though you

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.850 
in a son order like even though you
could<00:01:03.059> do<00:01:03.359> them<00:01:03.539> out<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.719> order<00:01:03.930> sometimes<00:01:04.379> and

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
could do them out of order sometimes and

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.250 
could do them out of order sometimes and
like<00:01:04.920> ocarina<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.430> time<00:01:05.489> even<00:01:06.360> majora's<00:01:07.229> mask

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
like ocarina of time even majora's mask

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.200 
like ocarina of time even majora's mask
but<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:07.950> they're<00:01:08.460> playing<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.820> go<00:01:08.909> back<00:01:09.090> to

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
but and they're playing to go back to

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.600 
but and they're playing to go back to
like<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.750> app<00:01:10.260> actually<00:01:10.590> it's<00:01:11.100> like<00:01:11.220> back<00:01:11.430> on

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
like the app actually it's like back on

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.310 
like the app actually it's like back on
the<00:01:11.760> Nintendo<00:01:12.210> Jane<00:01:12.479> system<00:01:12.869> with<00:01:12.990> the

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
the Nintendo Jane system with the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.109 
the Nintendo Jane system with the
original<00:01:13.470> Legend<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:13.979> Zelda<00:01:14.220> where<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.000> can

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
original Legend of Zelda where you can

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.730 
original Legend of Zelda where you can
do<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.509> dungeons<00:01:15.869> pretty<00:01:16.140> much<00:01:16.259> any<00:01:16.439> order

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
do the dungeons pretty much any order

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.200 
do the dungeons pretty much any order
even<00:01:17.159> though<00:01:17.250> doing<00:01:17.580> that's<00:01:17.729> kind<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:17.970> silly

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
even though doing that's kind of silly

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.490 
even though doing that's kind of silly
because<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.810> tangents<00:01:19.229> do<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.380> get

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
because the tangents do you get

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.380 
because the tangents do you get
progressively<00:01:19.979> harder<00:01:20.220> at<00:01:20.939> least<00:01:21.000> they<00:01:21.240> do

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
progressively harder at least they do

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.600 
progressively harder at least they do
from<00:01:21.509> my<00:01:21.659> memory<00:01:21.990> anyway<00:01:22.740> I'm<00:01:22.950> I'm<00:01:23.310> talking

content<00:01:40.200> as<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:41.340> why<00:01:41.460> pod<00:01:41.759> now<00:01:42.680> when<00:01:43.680> they<00:01:43.799> kind

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
content as to why pod now when they kind

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.469 
content as to why pod now when they kind
of<00:01:44.189> said<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:44.520> what's<00:01:44.700> going<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.939> think<00:01:45.119> maybe

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
of said this what's going to think maybe

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.730 
of said this what's going to think maybe
you're<00:01:45.570> going<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.780> add<00:01:45.840> new<00:01:45.869> dungeons<00:01:46.500> and

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
you're going to add new dungeons and

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.980 
you're going to add new dungeons and
stuff<00:01:46.920> like<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.130> but<00:01:47.579> then<00:01:47.939> again<00:01:48.060> and

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
stuff like that but then again and

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.590 
stuff like that but then again and
knowing<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:50.040> they're<00:01:50.189> like<00:01:50.450> this<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.570> a

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
knowing that they're like this is a

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.300 
knowing that they're like this is a
chance<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.079> improve<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.680> game<00:01:52.829> like<00:01:53.009> lots<00:01:53.189> of

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
chance to improve the game like lots of

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.859 
chance to improve the game like lots of
people<00:01:53.549> kind<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.820> had<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.000> problem<00:01:54.329> with<00:01:54.600> the

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
people kind of had a problem with the

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.749 
people kind of had a problem with the
saving<00:01:55.380> kind<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.829> taking<00:01:56.130> out<00:01:56.219> too<00:01:56.340> much<00:01:56.460> time

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
saving kind of taking out too much time

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.819 
saving kind of taking out too much time
so<00:01:57.060> maybe<00:01:57.960> they're<00:01:58.229> going<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.409> add<00:01:58.530> like

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
so maybe they're going to add like

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.160 
so maybe they're going to add like
something<00:01:59.369> like<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.509> want<00:02:00.750> you're<00:02:00.899> saying

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
something like I want you're saying

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.660 
something like I want you're saying
around<00:02:01.439> probably<00:02:01.619> like<00:02:01.860> new<00:02:02.070> monsters<00:02:02.549> or

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
around probably like new monsters or

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.010 
around probably like new monsters or
obstacles<00:02:03.180> so<00:02:03.299> they're<00:02:03.479> probably<00:02:03.509> gonna<00:02:03.840> like

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
obstacles so they're probably gonna like

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.469 
obstacles so they're probably gonna like
shorten<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.649> areas<00:02:05.159> like<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:06.000> gaps<00:02:06.240> between

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
shorten the areas like the gaps between

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.740 
shorten the areas like the gaps between
the<00:02:06.750> islands<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.940> basically<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:09.060> never<00:02:09.569> had

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
the islands and basically I never had

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.969 
the islands and basically I never had
too<00:02:09.899> much<00:02:10.020> of<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.229> problem<00:02:10.410> like<00:02:10.619> even<00:02:10.890> though

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
too much of a problem like even though

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.290 
too much of a problem like even though
it<00:02:11.039> was<00:02:11.160> kind<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.489> long<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:11.760> thought<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:11.970> kind<00:02:12.209> of

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
it was kind of long I thought I kind of

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.670 
it was kind of long I thought I kind of
relax

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
relax

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.170 
relax
that's<00:02:12.980> like<00:02:13.099> a<00:02:13.129> break<00:02:13.430> between<00:02:13.730> all<00:02:14.090> the

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
that's like a break between all the

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.449 
that's like a break between all the
islands<00:02:14.569> then<00:02:14.780> I<00:02:15.019> thought<00:02:15.799> I<00:02:15.829> was<00:02:16.040> kind<00:02:16.250> of<00:02:16.370> a

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
islands then I thought I was kind of a

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.240 
islands then I thought I was kind of a
good<00:02:16.609> idea<00:02:16.879> to<00:02:17.030> be<00:02:17.060> honest<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:17.980> like<00:02:18.980> I<00:02:19.069> I

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
good idea to be honest and like I I

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.920 
good idea to be honest and like I I
honestly<00:02:19.519> I<00:02:19.790> don't<00:02:19.879> mind<00:02:20.180> if<00:02:20.269> it<00:02:20.390> changes<00:02:20.750> long

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
honestly I don't mind if it changes long

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.330 
honestly I don't mind if it changes long
as<00:02:21.019> they<00:02:21.079> don't<00:02:21.170> change<00:02:21.469> a<00:02:21.590> drastically<00:02:22.069> to

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
as they don't change a drastically to

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.830 
as they don't change a drastically to
the<00:02:22.430> point<00:02:22.640> where<00:02:22.760> it<00:02:22.819> feels<00:02:22.969> like<00:02:23.090> each

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
the point where it feels like each

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.110 
the point where it feels like each
islands<00:02:24.290> practically<00:02:24.709> touching<00:02:25.099> don't<00:02:26.000> just

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
islands practically touching don't just

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.270 
islands practically touching don't just
be<00:02:26.180> kind<00:02:26.390> of<00:02:26.510> which<00:02:26.659> I<00:02:27.019> like<00:02:27.920> you<00:02:28.069> want<00:02:28.219> to
