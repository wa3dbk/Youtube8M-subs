00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489

and I'm going to take some snips and I'm

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.700 
and I'm going to take some snips and I'm
going<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.859> cut<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.280> down<00:00:47.690> to<00:00:48.690> match<00:00:48.960> his

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
going to cut this down to match his

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.110 
going to cut this down to match his
goggles<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.370> see<00:00:50.550> if<00:00:50.640> we<00:00:50.730> can<00:00:50.850> get<00:00:50.969> this<00:00:51.059> to

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
goggles and see if we can get this to

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.229 
goggles and see if we can get this to
fit<00:00:51.359> better<00:00:52.550> alright<00:00:53.550> so<00:00:53.730> this<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.059> just

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
fit better alright so this is just

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.849 
fit better alright so this is just
elastic<00:00:54.960> material<00:00:56.000> that's<00:00:57.000> been<00:00:57.469> hot<00:00:58.469> looks

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
elastic material that's been hot looks

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.340 
elastic material that's been hot looks
like<00:00:58.980> it's<00:00:59.129> hot<00:00:59.280> glued<00:00:59.519> on<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.449> raw<00:01:00.839> edge<00:01:01.079> of

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
like it's hot glued on the raw edge of

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.369 
like it's hot glued on the raw edge of
this<00:01:01.530> mesh<00:01:02.460> material<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.690> just<00:01:03.899> peeled<00:01:04.199> it

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
this mesh material so I just peeled it

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.920 
this mesh material so I just peeled it
off<00:01:04.610> there's<00:01:05.610> still<00:01:05.880> some<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.300> it<00:01:06.420> on<00:01:06.570> here

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
off there's still some of it on here

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.400 
off there's still some of it on here
I'll<00:01:07.110> just<00:01:07.170> have<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.560> take<00:01:07.680> my<00:01:07.860> time<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:09.410> peel

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
I'll just have to take my time and peel

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.460 
I'll just have to take my time and peel
this<00:01:10.590> off<00:01:10.770> carefully<00:01:11.600> it<00:01:12.600> doesn't<00:01:13.200> take<00:01:13.320> too

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
this off carefully it doesn't take too

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.930 
this off carefully it doesn't take too
long<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.800> come<00:01:13.950> off<00:01:15.650> so<00:01:16.670> what<00:01:17.670> we're<00:01:17.790> going<00:01:17.880> to

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
long to come off so what we're going to

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.260 
long to come off so what we're going to
do<00:01:18.120> is<00:01:18.710> trim<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:19.890> up<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:20.910> fits<00:01:21.090> his

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
do is trim this up so that it fits his

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.730 
do is trim this up so that it fits his
goggles<00:01:21.690> a<00:01:21.780> little<00:01:21.960> bit<00:01:22.050> better<00:01:22.230> and<00:01:24.740> and

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
goggles a little bit better and and

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.220 
goggles a little bit better and and
hopefully<00:01:26.280> this'll<00:01:27.240> work

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:28.230 
hopefully this'll work

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.340 
hopefully this'll work
to<00:01:29.160> protect<00:01:29.460> his<00:01:29.700> mouth<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.450> his<00:01:30.630> lower<00:01:31.080> face

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
to protect his mouth and his lower face

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.120 
to protect his mouth and his lower face
a<00:01:31.380> little<00:01:31.560> better<00:01:33.170> it's<00:01:34.170> all<00:01:34.350> overlapped<00:01:34.800> and

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
a little better it's all overlapped and

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.760 
a little better it's all overlapped and
his<00:01:35.400> glasses<00:01:35.700> right<00:01:36.090> here<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.660> this<00:01:37.410> and

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
his glasses right here and this and

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.950 
his glasses right here and this and
everything<00:01:38.760> else<00:01:38.970> puts<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.540> lot<00:01:39.660> of<00:01:39.690> pressure

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
everything else puts a lot of pressure

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.650 
everything else puts a lot of pressure
on<00:01:40.080> here<00:01:40.260> and<00:01:40.410> he<00:01:40.500> actually<00:01:40.680> has<00:01:40.920> like<00:01:41.070> little

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
on here and he actually has like little

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.030 
on here and he actually has like little
indentions<00:01:42.660> on<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.870> side<00:01:43.080> of<00:01:43.110> his<00:01:43.290> nose<00:01:43.500> half

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
indentions on the side of his nose half

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.970 
indentions on the side of his nose half
the<00:01:44.190> times<00:01:44.400> looks<00:01:44.910> really<00:01:45.180> uncomfortable<00:01:45.980> so

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:46.980 
the times looks really uncomfortable so

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.430 
the times looks really uncomfortable so
I<00:01:47.010> kind<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.640> roughly<00:01:48.150> marked<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.660> out<00:01:48.780> with<00:01:49.410> a

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
I kind of roughly marked it out with a

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.830 
I kind of roughly marked it out with a
sharpie<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.700> we're<00:01:51.120> going<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.270> try<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.600> cut

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
sharpie and we're going to try to cut

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.240 
sharpie and we're going to try to cut
that<00:01:52.050> down<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.610> fit<00:01:53.610> his<00:01:54.590> face<00:01:55.590> profile<00:01:56.220> a

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
that down to fit his face profile a

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:07.940 
that down to fit his face profile a
little<00:01:56.370> bit<00:01:56.670> better<00:01:56.820> Oh

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
that's why I haven't been making any

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.270 
that's why I haven't been making any
tech<00:02:41.970> videos<00:02:42.480> lately<00:02:42.840> I've<00:02:43.830> been<00:02:43.920> trimming<00:02:44.160> a

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
tech videos lately I've been trimming a

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.080 
tech videos lately I've been trimming a
while<00:02:44.459> talk<00:02:44.790> about<00:02:44.970> that<00:02:45.390> much<00:02:45.660> off<00:02:45.930> of<00:02:45.959> there

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
while talk about that much off of there

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.850 
while talk about that much off of there
and<00:02:48.090> around<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.720> nose<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:48.959> I<00:02:49.260> kept<00:02:49.470> trimming

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
and around the nose and I kept trimming

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.270 
and around the nose and I kept trimming
it<00:02:50.010> it's<00:02:51.000> best<00:02:51.299> to<00:02:51.450> go<00:02:51.690> less<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:52.739> then<00:02:53.069> you<00:02:53.100> can

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
it it's best to go less and then you can

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.650 
it it's best to go less and then you can
always<00:02:53.489> trim<00:02:53.670> a<00:02:53.730> little<00:02:53.880> bit<00:02:54.030> more<00:02:54.269> you<00:02:54.480> just

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
always trim a little bit more you just

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.370 
always trim a little bit more you just
can't<00:02:54.840> add<00:02:55.049> any<00:02:55.290> put<00:02:56.130> that<00:02:56.569> is<00:02:57.569> the<00:02:58.170> matchup

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
can't add any put that is the matchup

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.930 
can't add any put that is the matchup
right<00:02:58.650> there<00:02:59.280> I<00:02:59.720> actually<00:03:00.720> had<00:03:01.170> to<00:03:01.700> flare<00:03:02.700> this

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
right there I actually had to flare this

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:03.740 
right there I actually had to flare this
forward

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
forward

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.199 
forward
I<00:03:03.780> use<00:03:04.290> these<00:03:04.470> pliers<00:03:04.739> and<00:03:05.100> I<00:03:05.190> kind<00:03:05.459> of<00:03:05.489> grabbed

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
I use these pliers and I kind of grabbed

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.699 
I use these pliers and I kind of grabbed
it<00:03:06.390> here<00:03:06.600> and<00:03:06.720> bent<00:03:06.930> it<00:03:07.049> forward<00:03:07.380> a<00:03:07.440> little<00:03:07.560> bit

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
it here and bent it forward a little bit

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:13.759 
it here and bent it forward a little bit
so<00:03:07.910> so<00:03:08.910> right<00:03:09.150> here<00:03:09.950> it<00:03:10.950> rides<00:03:12.170> it<00:03:13.170> rides<00:03:13.500> in

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
so so right here it rides it rides in

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.240 
so so right here it rides it rides in
this<00:03:13.980> groove<00:03:14.570> and<00:03:15.570> stead<00:03:16.440> up<00:03:16.590> on<00:03:16.739> this<00:03:16.890> face

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
this groove and stead up on this face

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.900 
this groove and stead up on this face
right<00:03:18.000> here<00:03:18.420> I<00:03:19.250> pulled<00:03:20.250> this<00:03:20.400> forward<00:03:20.700> a

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
right here I pulled this forward a

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.310 
right here I pulled this forward a
little<00:03:21.060> bit<00:03:21.180> so<00:03:21.450> it<00:03:21.540> wouldn't<00:03:21.780> be<00:03:21.900> putting

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
little bit so it wouldn't be putting

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.910 
little bit so it wouldn't be putting
pressure<00:03:22.590> on<00:03:22.799> his<00:03:23.100> nose<00:03:23.700> and<00:03:24.200> right<00:03:25.200> here<00:03:25.709> is<00:03:25.890> a

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
pressure on his nose and right here is a

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.810 
pressure on his nose and right here is a
spot<00:03:26.310> where<00:03:26.670> a<00:03:26.850> lot<00:03:27.209> of<00:03:27.239> times<00:03:27.540> BB<00:03:28.260> can<00:03:28.560> come

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
spot where a lot of times BB can come

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.120 
spot where a lot of times BB can come
through<00:03:30.320> when<00:03:31.320> it<00:03:31.410> hits<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.709> side<00:03:31.890> of<00:03:32.040> your

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
through when it hits the side of your

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.550 
through when it hits the side of your
nose<00:03:32.280> and<00:03:32.700> it'll<00:03:32.940> it'll<00:03:33.450> go<00:03:33.630> into<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.109> goggles

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
nose and it'll it'll go into the goggles

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.840 
nose and it'll it'll go into the goggles
from<00:03:34.829> that<00:03:35.070> area

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.390 

dr.<00:03:38.850> airsoft<00:03:39.299> has<00:03:39.540> some<00:03:40.070> videos<00:03:41.070> where<00:03:41.310> it

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
dr. airsoft has some videos where it

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.960 
dr. airsoft has some videos where it
shows<00:03:42.829> where<00:03:43.829> this<00:03:43.950> is<00:03:44.100> a<00:03:44.130> weak<00:03:44.340> link<00:03:44.549> on<00:03:44.760> a<00:03:44.790> lot

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
shows where this is a weak link on a lot

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:52.160 
shows where this is a weak link on a lot
of<00:03:45.090> masks<00:03:47.120> alright<00:03:48.120> so<00:03:48.540> I<00:03:48.870> got<00:03:49.200> that<00:03:49.470> cut<00:03:51.170> to

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
of masks alright so I got that cut to

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.430 
of masks alright so I got that cut to
fit<00:03:52.470> this<00:03:52.680> mask<00:03:53.040> and<00:03:53.340> I<00:03:53.690> went<00:03:54.690> over<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.140> nose

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
fit this mask and I went over the nose

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.210 
fit this mask and I went over the nose
piece<00:03:55.890> here<00:03:56.400> trying<00:03:57.000> to<00:03:57.090> keep<00:03:57.269> the<00:03:57.480> beads<00:03:57.660> out

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
piece here trying to keep the beads out

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.020 
piece here trying to keep the beads out
I'm<00:03:59.220> going<00:03:59.400> to<00:03:59.459> put<00:03:59.609> hot<00:03:59.819> glue<00:03:59.850> here<00:04:00.420> and

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
I'm going to put hot glue here and

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.270 
I'm going to put hot glue here and
basically<00:04:03.030> and<00:04:03.600> then<00:04:03.750> glue<00:04:03.989> this<00:04:04.200> on<00:04:04.440> and<00:04:04.769> then

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
work it back around by the way it was on

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.370 
work it back around by the way it was on
there<00:04:09.239> originally<00:04:11.510> so<00:04:12.510> what<00:04:12.780> I<00:04:12.810> found<00:04:13.079> is<00:04:13.350> you

squeeze<00:04:13.859> the<00:04:14.040> glue<00:04:14.280> in<00:04:14.760> a<00:04:14.940> line<00:04:15.209> across<00:04:15.540> here

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
squeeze the glue in a line across here

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.649 
squeeze the glue in a line across here
and<00:04:16.169> then<00:04:17.070> across<00:04:17.400> here<00:04:17.789> that<00:04:17.940> way<00:04:18.269> you've<00:04:18.419> got

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:18.659 
and then across here that way you've got

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:19.650 
and then across here that way you've got
it<00:04:18.870> glued<00:04:19.380> in<00:04:19.530> the

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
on there and rapidly you know hold the

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.810 
on there and rapidly you know hold the
piece<00:04:25.270> on<00:04:25.480> there<00:04:25.750> and<00:04:25.960> and<00:04:26.550> squeeze<00:04:27.550> it<00:04:27.670> down

it's it's not quite as smooth as the
factory<00:04:31.980> job<00:04:33.420> but<00:04:34.980> hey<00:04:35.980> looks<00:04:36.790> pretty<00:04:37.060> decent

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
factory job but hey looks pretty decent

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.740 
factory job but hey looks pretty decent
I<00:04:37.660> think<00:04:38.400> all<00:04:39.400> right<00:04:39.610> so<00:04:40.060> there<00:04:40.270> you<00:04:40.360> go<00:04:40.480> check

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
I think all right so there you go check

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.650 
I think all right so there you go check
it<00:04:40.840> out<00:04:42.480> nice<00:04:43.480> fit

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
it out nice fit

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:56.850 
it out nice fit

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
seals really well nice tight fit against

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:05.760 
seals really well nice tight fit against
