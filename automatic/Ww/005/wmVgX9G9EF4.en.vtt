00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.870 
you do that it coats it a little bit
it's<00:01:55.799> supposed<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.189> help<00:01:56.280> prevent

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
it's supposed to help prevent

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.490 
it's supposed to help prevent
discoloration<00:01:57.360> because<00:01:57.990> they<00:01:58.110> can't<00:01:58.320> turn

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
discoloration because they can't turn

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.560 
discoloration because they can't turn
gray<00:01:58.799> they<00:01:59.070> do<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.430> they<00:01:59.520> look<00:01:59.880> really<00:02:00.030> nasty

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
gray they do and they look really nasty

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.060 
gray they do and they look really nasty
and<00:02:00.780> another<00:02:01.320> thing<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.740> don't<00:02:01.799> want<00:02:02.009> to

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
and another thing is you don't want to

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.280 
and another thing is you don't want to
use<00:02:02.159> an<00:02:02.280> aluminum<00:02:02.670> pot<00:02:02.909> you<00:02:03.180> use<00:02:03.689> an<00:02:03.869> aluminum

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
use an aluminum pot you use an aluminum

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.899 
use an aluminum pot you use an aluminum
pot<00:02:04.530> you're<00:02:04.890> going<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.100> get<00:02:05.159> discoloration

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
pot you're going to get discoloration

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.690 
pot you're going to get discoloration
also<00:02:06.680> so<00:02:07.680> use<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:07.890> nonreactive<00:02:08.280> use<00:02:08.670> a

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
also so use a nonreactive use a

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.210 
also so use a nonreactive use a
nonreactive<00:02:09.119> pot<00:02:09.629> right<00:02:09.929> so<00:02:10.920> if<00:02:11.099> we're

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
nonreactive pot right so if we're

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.440 
nonreactive pot right so if we're
cooking<00:02:11.459> them<00:02:11.550> whole<00:02:11.790> you're<00:02:12.150> looking<00:02:12.360> about

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
cooking them whole you're looking about

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.030 
cooking them whole you're looking about
20

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
20

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.709 
20
minutes<00:02:13.310> approximately<00:02:14.060> if<00:02:14.299> you're<00:02:14.450> cooking

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:14.719 
minutes approximately if you're cooking

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:16.479 
minutes approximately if you're cooking
them<00:02:14.840> in<00:02:14.930> half<00:02:15.140> it's<00:02:15.409> probably<00:02:15.769> about<00:02:15.890> 15

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
them in half it's probably about 15

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.250 
them in half it's probably about 15
minutes<00:02:16.790> you<00:02:17.450> probably<00:02:17.599> want<00:02:17.810> to<00:02:17.870> check<00:02:18.079> about

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
minutes you probably want to check about

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.830 
minutes you probably want to check about
five<00:02:18.620> minutes<00:02:18.859> beforehand<00:02:19.640> to<00:02:20.540> make<00:02:20.569> sure

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
five minutes beforehand to make sure

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.270 
five minutes beforehand to make sure
that<00:02:21.049> they<00:02:21.200> are<00:02:21.230> done<00:02:21.620> and<00:02:21.829> not<00:02:21.950> overdone

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
that they are done and not overdone

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.429 
that they are done and not overdone
because<00:02:22.459> you<00:02:22.519> don't<00:02:22.670> want<00:02:22.700> a<00:02:22.819> really<00:02:23.000> mushy<00:02:23.439> so

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:24.439 
because you don't want a really mushy so

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:27.610 
because you don't want a really mushy so
I<00:02:24.920> just<00:02:25.519> like<00:02:25.640> to<00:02:25.760> take<00:02:25.879> a<00:02:25.939> plate<00:02:26.379> and<00:02:27.379> I<00:02:27.439> just

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
I just like to take a plate and I just

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.220 
I just like to take a plate and I just
turn<00:02:27.859> it<00:02:27.980> upside<00:02:28.310> down<00:02:28.750> put<00:02:29.750> it<00:02:29.840> in<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.019> pot

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
turn it upside down put it in the pot

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.929 
turn it upside down put it in the pot
and<00:02:30.680> that<00:02:30.890> just<00:02:31.099> keeps<00:02:31.280> them<00:02:31.459> smarter<00:02:31.790> keep

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:31.939 
and that just keeps them smarter keep

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:33.280 
and that just keeps them smarter keep
some<00:02:32.090> submerge<00:02:32.450> so<00:02:32.720> now<00:02:32.870> they're<00:02:33.079> going<00:02:33.200> to

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
some submerge so now they're going to

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.660 
some submerge so now they're going to
cook<00:02:33.439> nice<00:02:33.680> and<00:02:33.709> even<00:02:34.099> so<00:02:34.400> what<00:02:34.489> we're<00:02:34.579> going

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
cook nice and even so what we're going

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:35.679 
cook nice and even so what we're going
to<00:02:34.760> do<00:02:34.909> now<00:02:35.060> is<00:02:35.090> we're<00:02:35.299> just<00:02:35.329> going<00:02:35.510> to<00:02:35.569> bring

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:35.689 
to do now is we're just going to bring

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:37.539 
to do now is we're just going to bring
it<00:02:35.840> up<00:02:35.870> to<00:02:36.049> a<00:02:36.079> simmer<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:36.590> then<00:02:36.680> after<00:02:37.430> it

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
it up to a simmer and then after it

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.339 
it up to a simmer and then after it
simmers<00:02:37.939> we'll<00:02:38.299> just<00:02:38.540> lower<00:02:38.750> it<00:02:38.810> just<00:02:38.989> enough

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
simmers we'll just lower it just enough

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.140 
simmers we'll just lower it just enough
to<00:02:39.500> keep<00:02:39.650> that<00:02:39.859> simmer<00:02:40.220> and<00:02:40.519> we'll<00:02:40.909> check

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
to keep that simmer and we'll check

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.140 
to keep that simmer and we'll check
these<00:02:41.329> probably<00:02:41.689> in<00:02:41.780> about<00:02:41.840> ten<00:02:42.139> minutes<00:02:43.150> okay

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
these probably in about ten minutes okay

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.520 
these probably in about ten minutes okay
it's<00:02:44.299> been<00:02:44.359> about<00:02:44.420> 15<00:02:44.930> minutes<00:02:45.139> with<00:02:45.409> the

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
it's been about 15 minutes with the

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.369 
it's been about 15 minutes with the
magic<00:02:46.010> of<00:02:46.129> TV<00:02:46.340> and<00:02:46.819> we<00:02:47.120> are<00:02:47.450> now<00:02:47.780> poking<00:02:48.260> it

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:48.379 
magic of TV and we are now poking it

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:50.349 
magic of TV and we are now poking it
it's<00:02:48.620> rare<00:02:48.829> to<00:02:48.859> see<00:02:49.099> if<00:02:49.370> it<00:02:49.489> goes<00:02:49.700> yeah<00:02:50.150> there's

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
it's rare to see if it goes yeah there's

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:52.179 
it's rare to see if it goes yeah there's
a<00:02:50.450> little<00:02:50.569> bit<00:02:50.780> of<00:02:50.840> resistance<00:02:51.169> not<00:02:51.560> not<00:02:51.919> too

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:52.189 
a little bit of resistance not not too

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:54.369 
a little bit of resistance not not too
much<00:02:52.340> I<00:02:52.609> think<00:02:52.790> that's<00:02:52.970> about<00:02:53.120> done<00:02:53.510> so<00:02:54.260> we

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
much I think that's about done so we

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:56.920 
much I think that's about done so we
want<00:02:54.560> to<00:02:54.650> do<00:02:54.799> is<00:02:55.040> take<00:02:56.030> that<00:02:56.329> and<00:02:56.480> let<00:02:56.599> it<00:02:56.629> drain

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
want to do is take that and let it drain
