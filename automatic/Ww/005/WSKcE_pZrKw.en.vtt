what and an emery board to help file
down<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:51.020> growth<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.789> it<00:00:53.789> does<00:00:54.030> work<00:00:54.140> but

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
down the growth so it does work but

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.490 
down the growth so it does work but
there's<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.489> much<00:00:56.670> easier<00:00:56.699> way<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.210> do<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.660> to

there's a much easier way to do it to

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.170 
there's a much easier way to do it to
get<00:00:59.340> rid<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.579> these<00:00:59.699> things

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
compound W is is that salicylic acid so

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.760 
compound W is is that salicylic acid so
it<00:01:30.240> won't<00:01:30.420> harm<00:01:30.659> your<00:01:30.780> skin<00:01:30.960> but<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.439> will<00:01:31.590> help

skin tags and the moles but what you

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.880 
skin tags and the moles but what you
should<00:01:39.090> do<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.630> put<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.259> little<00:01:40.530> bit<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.770> the

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
should do is put a little bit of the

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.340

acne cream on the the wart or the or the
growth<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.100> then<00:01:47.399> take<00:01:47.909> some<00:01:48.240> just<00:01:48.899> common

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
growth and then take some just common

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.639 
growth and then take some just common
duct<00:01:49.500> tape<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.720> put<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:51.840> duct<00:01:52.079> tape<00:01:52.320> over<00:01:52.470> it

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
duct tape and put that duct tape over it

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.999 
duct tape and put that duct tape over it
and<00:01:52.860> really<00:01:53.070> seal<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.520> in<00:01:53.640> there<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:55.009> basically

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
and really seal it in there so basically

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.590 
and really seal it in there so basically
that'll<00:01:56.430> help<00:01:57.590> seal<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:59.009> salicylic<00:01:59.790> acid<00:02:00.479> in

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
that'll help seal the salicylic acid in

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.359 
that'll help seal the salicylic acid in
there<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.020> actually<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.649> duct<00:02:01.860> tape<00:02:02.040> alone

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
there and actually the duct tape alone

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.359 
there and actually the duct tape alone
also<00:02:02.759> will<00:02:03.149> work<00:02:03.390> so<00:02:03.810> there's<00:02:04.649> your<00:02:04.829> solution

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
also will work so there's your solution

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.380 
also will work so there's your solution
and<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:06.210> takes<00:02:06.420> about<00:02:06.630> I<00:02:07.399> don't<00:02:08.399> know<00:02:08.489> at<00:02:09.239> the

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
and it takes about I don't know at the

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.930 
and it takes about I don't know at the
most<00:02:09.629> a<00:02:09.989> few<00:02:10.259> days<00:02:10.679> of<00:02:11.009> doing<00:02:11.280> that<00:02:11.430> maybe

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
most a few days of doing that maybe

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.420 
most a few days of doing that maybe
taking<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.420> off<00:02:12.599> when<00:02:12.870> you

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
taking it off when you

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.990 
taking it off when you
and<00:02:13.700> reapplying<00:02:14.390> it<00:02:14.629> but<00:02:15.439> you<00:02:16.069> know<00:02:16.189> for<00:02:16.519> two

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
and reapplying it but you know for two

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.479 
and reapplying it but you know for two
bucks<00:02:17.239> at<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.569> 99-cent<00:02:18.200> store<00:02:18.560> you<00:02:19.129> can<00:02:19.280> take
