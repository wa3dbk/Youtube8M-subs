slower<00:03:52.299> than<00:03:52.510> it<00:03:52.629> was<00:03:52.810> there<00:03:53.049> in<00:03:53.170> today<00:03:53.409> so<00:03:54.540> we

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
slower than it was there in today so we

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.750 
slower than it was there in today so we
may<00:03:56.230> have<00:03:56.439> to<00:03:56.590> call<00:03:56.769> it<00:03:56.950> a<00:03:57.010> day<00:03:57.189> pretty<00:03:57.489> soon
