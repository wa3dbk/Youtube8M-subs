00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
have like this new format so far

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.110 
have like this new format so far
hopefully<00:03:22.920> it<00:03:23.100> doesn't<00:03:23.250> screw<00:03:23.610> up<00:03:23.640> down<00:03:23.970> the

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
hopefully it doesn't screw up down the

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.120 
hopefully it doesn't screw up down the
stretch<00:03:24.360> but<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:25.530> fact<00:03:25.739> that<00:03:25.830> we<00:03:25.980> were<00:03:26.040> able

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
stretch but the fact that we were able

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.580 
stretch but the fact that we were able
to<00:03:26.250> get<00:03:26.430> 300<00:03:27.150> people<00:03:27.450> into<00:03:27.690> cars<00:03:27.930> as<00:03:28.260> opposed
