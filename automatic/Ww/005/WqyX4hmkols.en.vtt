much as it used to but I have been on it

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.520 
much as it used to but I have been on it
for<00:02:59.799> about<00:03:00.129> 2<00:03:00.849> hours<00:03:00.879> 3<00:03:01.239> hours<00:03:01.540> a<00:03:01.810> day<00:03:02.109> for<00:03:02.440> the

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
for about 2 hours 3 hours a day for the

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.050 
for about 2 hours 3 hours a day for the
past<00:03:02.670> seven<00:03:03.670> days<00:03:03.700> so<00:03:05.220> my<00:03:06.220> butt's<00:03:06.760> a<00:03:06.849> little

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
past seven days so my butt's a little

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.809 
past seven days so my butt's a little
sore<00:03:07.269> but<00:03:07.959> other<00:03:08.109> than<00:03:08.260> that<00:03:08.349> it<00:03:08.769> feels<00:03:09.549> nice

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
sore but other than that it feels nice

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.210 
sore but other than that it feels nice
so<00:03:10.510> I<00:03:10.540> think<00:03:10.690> it's<00:03:10.989> just<00:03:11.230> after<00:03:11.440> the<00:03:11.799> first<00:03:12.040> few

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.740 
so I think it's just after the first few
rides<00:03:12.459> it<00:03:12.670> bruised<00:03:12.909> up<00:03:13.090> a<00:03:13.209> little<00:03:13.420> bit<00:03:13.540> and<00:03:13.690> it
