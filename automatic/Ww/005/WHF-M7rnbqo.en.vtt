00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.210 
I believe they're they've got a bit of
wood<00:02:30.150> there<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.750> big<00:02:31.019> big<00:02:31.410> wooden<00:02:31.680> panel<00:02:32.069> to

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
wood there a big big wooden panel to

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.059 
wood there a big big wooden panel to
support<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.760> television<00:02:33.709> it's<00:02:34.709> a<00:02:34.769> slightly

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
support the television it's a slightly

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.199 
support the television it's a slightly
different<00:02:35.190> material<00:02:35.730> they've<00:02:35.850> used<00:02:36.060> for

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
different material they've used for

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.000 
different material they've used for
these<00:02:36.300> drums<00:02:36.660> because<00:02:37.050> these<00:02:37.230> five<00:02:37.620> run<00:02:37.860> out

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
these drums because these five run out

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.350 
these drums because these five run out
but<00:02:38.220> apparently<00:02:38.580> it's<00:02:38.760> quite<00:02:38.850> effective

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
but apparently it's quite effective

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.660 
but apparently it's quite effective
so<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.440> televisions<00:02:40.890> you<00:02:41.069> to<00:02:41.190> go<00:02:41.310> there<00:02:41.489> and

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
so the televisions you to go there and

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.570 
so the televisions you to go there and
or<00:02:42.090> my<00:02:42.930> projection<00:02:43.380> screen<00:02:43.650> haven't<00:02:44.040> made<00:02:44.550> a

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
or my projection screen haven't made a

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.330 
or my projection screen haven't made a
final<00:02:45.090> decision<00:02:45.299> on<00:02:45.570> that<00:02:45.920> machine<00:02:46.920> rooms

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
final decision on that machine rooms

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.630 
final decision on that machine rooms
looking<00:02:47.910> very<00:02:48.840> interesting<00:02:49.290> so<00:02:49.620> similar<00:02:50.610> to

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
looking very interesting so similar to

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.210 
looking very interesting so similar to
the<00:02:50.850> rubber<00:02:51.030> pads<00:02:51.540> that<00:02:51.810> we<00:02:51.959> saw<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.560> studio's

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
the rubber pads that we saw the studio's

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.990 
the rubber pads that we saw the studio's
floated<00:02:53.640> in<00:02:54.079> this<00:02:55.079> is<00:02:55.200> all<00:02:55.290> now

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.010 

they're<00:02:58.300> actually<00:02:58.540> going<00:02:58.660> to<00:02:58.750> put<00:02:58.870> these

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
they're actually going to put these

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.400 
they're actually going to put these
fittings<00:02:59.680> on<00:02:59.860> for<00:03:00.190> these<00:03:00.400> and<00:03:01.320> bits<00:03:02.320> of

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
fittings on for these and bits of

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.960 
fittings on for these and bits of
flooring<00:03:02.770> here<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.130> idea<00:03:03.460> is<00:03:03.610> that<00:03:03.640> you'll<00:03:03.880> be

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
flooring here the idea is that you'll be

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.490 
flooring here the idea is that you'll be
able<00:03:04.060> to<00:03:04.210> lift<00:03:04.420> the<00:03:04.540> floor<00:03:04.750> up<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:04.960> physically

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
able to lift the floor up and physically

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.460 
able to lift the floor up and physically
feed<00:03:05.800> cables<00:03:06.310> through<00:03:06.880> and<00:03:07.120> so<00:03:07.900> I'll<00:03:08.230> just<00:03:08.260> get

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
feed cables through and so I'll just get

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.560 
feed cables through and so I'll just get
mounted<00:03:08.920> on<00:03:09.040> top<00:03:09.220> of<00:03:09.250> these<00:03:09.910> stands<00:03:10.300> here

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
mounted on top of these stands here

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.810 
mounted on top of these stands here
which<00:03:10.720> will<00:03:10.840> go<00:03:10.960> on<00:03:11.050> top<00:03:11.200> of<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.530> wooden<00:03:12.310> ply

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
which will go on top of the wooden ply

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.730 
which will go on top of the wooden ply
blocks<00:03:14.400> so<00:03:15.400> looking<00:03:16.180> very<00:03:16.330> good<00:03:16.660> I<00:03:16.870> made<00:03:17.710> a

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
blocks so looking very good I made a

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.160 
blocks so looking very good I made a
complete<00:03:17.980> howler<00:03:18.550> I<00:03:18.790> forgot<00:03:19.120> to<00:03:19.360> suggest<00:03:20.050> that

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
complete howler I forgot to suggest that

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.950 
complete howler I forgot to suggest that
we<00:03:20.320> tie<00:03:20.620> line<00:03:20.890> both<00:03:21.160> the<00:03:21.340> rooms<00:03:21.580> and<00:03:21.960> so

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:22.960 
we tie line both the rooms and so

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.940 
we tie line both the rooms and so
they've<00:03:23.320> retrospectively<00:03:24.220> fed<00:03:24.870> this<00:03:25.950> pipe

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
they've retrospectively fed this pipe

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.350 
they've retrospectively fed this pipe
right<00:03:27.670> round<00:03:27.970> through<00:03:28.720> into<00:03:29.320> the<00:03:30.360> hallway

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
right round through into the hallway

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.200 
right round through into the hallway
let's<00:03:31.810> take<00:03:32.200> a<00:03:32.230> look<00:03:32.500> in<00:03:33.220> chap<00:03:33.550> and<00:03:33.700> wither<00:03:33.910> and

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.210 
let's take a look in chap and wither and

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.860 
let's take a look in chap and wither and
and<00:03:35.520> so<00:03:36.520> it<00:03:36.640> comes<00:03:36.790> out<00:03:36.970> there<00:03:37.240> it<00:03:37.480> can<00:03:37.540> be<00:03:37.600> fed

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
and so it comes out there it can be fed

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.710 
and so it comes out there it can be fed
through<00:03:38.050> some<00:03:38.290> trunking<00:03:39.270> going<00:03:40.270> back<00:03:40.510> into

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
through some trunking going back into

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.540 
through some trunking going back into
studio<00:03:41.050> two<00:03:41.230> there<00:03:41.470> sorry<00:03:41.830> mate<00:03:42.010> and<00:03:42.690> yeah

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
studio two there sorry mate and yeah

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.820 
studio two there sorry mate and yeah
comes<00:03:45.550> out<00:03:45.850> here<00:03:46.270> this<00:03:46.600> is<00:03:46.750> just<00:03:46.930> a<00:03:47.110> draw<00:03:47.350> cable

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
comes out here this is just a draw cable

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.830 
comes out here this is just a draw cable
at<00:03:47.890> the<00:03:47.980> moment<00:03:48.310> so<00:03:48.430> we'll<00:03:48.580> be<00:03:48.790> able<00:03:48.820> to<00:03:49.180> just

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
at the moment so we'll be able to just

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.810 
at the moment so we'll be able to just
feed<00:03:50.140> up<00:03:50.290> a<00:03:50.500> limb<00:03:50.950> through<00:03:51.250> there<00:03:51.430> and<00:03:51.580> put<00:03:51.790> a

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
feed up a limb through there and put a

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.760 
feed up a limb through there and put a
little<00:03:51.940> tie<00:03:52.330> or<00:03:52.840> a<00:03:53.260> couple<00:03:53.830> of<00:03:54.540> XLR<00:03:55.540> boxes<00:03:56.140> so

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 
little tie or a couple of XLR boxes so

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.500 
little tie or a couple of XLR boxes so
they've<00:03:56.890> attached<00:03:57.130> that<00:03:57.340> some<00:03:57.640> hardwood<00:03:58.330> and

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
they've attached that some hardwood and

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.150 
they've attached that some hardwood and
panel<00:04:01.510> to<00:04:01.690> the<00:04:01.720> frame<00:04:01.810> there<00:04:02.290> so<00:04:02.590> we<00:04:02.830> can<00:04:03.010> mount

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
panel to the frame there so we can mount

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.340 
panel to the frame there so we can mount
out<00:04:03.460> any<00:04:03.670> TV<00:04:04.120> or<00:04:04.300> screens<00:04:04.630> that<00:04:04.810> we<00:04:04.930> like<00:04:05.110> up

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
out any TV or screens that we like up

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.230 
out any TV or screens that we like up
there<00:04:05.530> and<00:04:06.010> this<00:04:06.250> all<00:04:06.430> looks<00:04:06.730> in<00:04:06.850> good<00:04:07.060> shape

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
there and this all looks in good shape

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:14.370 
there and this all looks in good shape
to<00:04:10.830> look<00:04:11.830> at<00:04:11.950> this<00:04:12.070> wall<00:04:12.640> again<00:04:13.260> sealing<00:04:14.260> in

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
to look at this wall again sealing in

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.890 
to look at this wall again sealing in
that<00:04:14.560> lovely<00:04:14.950> white<00:04:15.280> color<00:04:15.610> but<00:04:15.850> in<00:04:16.359> now
