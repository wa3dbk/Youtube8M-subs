00:00:01.769 --> 00:00:05.859
 after receiving the wood shredded and then stored late 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.940
 the words are then sent to the paper mill 

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:17.810
 they are then life and then put to cook about 180 degrees in a recital 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:21.749
 this cooking allows you to get the pulp 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.910
 recovered cardboard used in the manufacture of pulp are 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:32.070
 crushed writing is in a machine called clippers 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.640
 this operation aims to aggregate the material and to put the fibers 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.050
 suspended in water 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.960
 the mixing which follow the refining it makes it possible to obtain a flexible fiber and 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.810
 well calibrated the dough is then ready for the manufacture of the building this 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.250
 ratio is achieved either continuously on a single machine 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.250
 either on different machines 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.610
 in a general way the pressure of texts and drawings these questions 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.860
 between two rotating cylinders 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.600
 one of the two cylinders bearing the stamp 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.600
 and the other serving as a counterpart 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.580
 the pressure can take place either on the carton during the operations of 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.910
 shaping either directly onto the paper before manufacturing 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.090
 the graphic goes from simple marking 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.720
 because of real impression in three or four colors when it comes 

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:34.150
 packaging that participates in the promotion of a product located 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:36.680
 usually on the production site 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.680
 the design office in charge of several missions 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.830
 designing packaging equipment in response to requests for 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.530
 the customer 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.260
 imagine their overall form and yet to presentation fismes 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.390
 adapt the design to the great diversity of objects 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.440
 research new products from a perspective of 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.440
 development a discreet and the commercial 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.650
 technicians and graphic designers from the design office use all the 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:08.839
 modern techniques 

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:14.149
 like the computer-aided design CADA drawing in three 

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:16.469
 dimensions where plotters and shots
