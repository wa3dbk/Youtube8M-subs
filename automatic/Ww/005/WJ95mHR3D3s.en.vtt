00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.939
 then guys good evening then tonight 

00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:08.860
 we will do a very interesting unboxing 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:13.680
 which is pretty much an unboxing by well 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:17.290
 600 grams of thistle with coffee and this 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.510
 I'm recovering with galaxy then with 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.160
 a hand 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.890
 I take things with the other face 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:28.390
 so i guess that video will be a lot but 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:34.539
 very very agitated so let's try to 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:36.640
 I open this fucking box I feel and 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:39.640
 voila unboxing has already been done time 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.329
 does seen that practically there is not 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:48.339
 He was almost a dick inside the ice cream 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:49.719
 but we have the ice cream already put in a 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:53.909
 I recommend a special container 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:57.999
 use containers that are longer 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:59.649
 capacious than normal and not like 

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:01.539
 I can say you don't do that 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.729
 use containers like a glass 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:06.100
 plastic like that because that is 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:09.159
 don't you guys don't do it then 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.530
 let's get a little bit like consistency and 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:16.450
 very very creamy 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:19.140
 there are small coffee beans that 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.850
 then in the end they know chocolate 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:29.789
 now let's see the il a little bit 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:37.329
 taste like we are a little bit then 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:44.229
 let's see a little bit I say mythical thing 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:46.270
 nectar of the gods in who I am very much 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.549
 good but when you take the warm one 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.880
 because otherwise it is not the same 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:50.880
 thing 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.039
 very soft I am not much of it 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.390
 coffee but also milk 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:02.619
 I would say almost a milk and coffee 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:08.050
 cappuccino is a the aftertaste feels 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:10.450
 of egg as can happen maybe with one 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.540
 grandfather's cup for example 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.190
 but I have to say that it is really a lot 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.099
 good 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.550
 then when we are left a little 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:27.190
 melting this fund is made there 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:28.569
 I show a lot among other things will be 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.310
 then the autofocus is disabled 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:34.780
 shit probably came the 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:37.890
 video this very soft background that you 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.480
 I assure you that it is truly exceptional 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:44.530
 let's make an ice cream macro see if 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.910
 we manage to focus on my own 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.310
 when he takes of what expires in 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:52.450
 2015 because it means that the new lot 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:58.319
 and that you will therefore definitely eat a 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.319
 fresh ice cream but not genuine hello
