00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hello everyone how are you in the video 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.990
 Today I'm going to teach you how to decorate 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:10.349
 this frame with wooden taquitos has 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.389
 inspired by one of zara home although it is 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.910
 say that it appears to us absolutely in 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.650
 nothing but I like a lot more 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.750
 result that I had that the one 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.300
 they sell in stores because I do not know 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.039
 colors seem much more cheerful and 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.650
 I do not know the truth is that the result I 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.650
 has loved and well let's start 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.610
 The materials that you will need are 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.730
 Wood Ribbons 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.579
 acrylic paintings 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.630
 Brushes 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:52.500
 with the wooden shovel or nails 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.150
 English box and saw 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.410
 the photo frame you want 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:00.660
 transform and I choose 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.790
 is what is assured to the readers the 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.930
 english box and cutting in 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.930
 tabs of half a centimeter 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.530
 to go faster and cut 2000 tickets 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.759
 in half and I have placed all the 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.290
 combos to cut it 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.330
 as luck goes the carguito 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.920
 put them on top of the frame to know 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.200
 It is also enough to cover all 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.619
 the surface 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.750
 and let some other anything to 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.909
 paint allows you to be used a 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.760
 water mix with very little paint 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.800
 acrylic 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.910
 so that when it is removed, it penetrates the 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.220
 wood and that does not stay in the 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.500
 surface 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.870
 and this I miss it so that the 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:47.490
 vein of wood the colors that I've 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:50.270
 used have been pink orange yellow 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.270
 green 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.960
 and blue 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.450
 to prepare the frame simply 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.450
 avoided portion output station 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.850
 and he chooses it to better match the 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.860
 balls 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.580
 and arrange the taquitos according to how 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.580
 you want to say 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.370
 when you have decided how they want us 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.730
 place gifts with the tail or for a 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.730
 nail 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.320
 are the ones that were left uncovered with 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.610
 the candid simply the oil with 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.610
 the painting that I stay here 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.180
 well after watching all the video I 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.810
 I think you have imagined that cut 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.810
 the wooden taquitos is the most difficult 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.210
 but it becomes a little long but 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.550
 I believe that the final result deserves 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.770
 very much it is worth to me I loved it 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.980
 anyway, what there was also 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:04.160
 thought is instead of using these 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.930
 wooden cues is to use the sticks 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.420
 of ice cream these that sell already for 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.060
 crafts also cutting what I 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.370
 I think it's going to be much easier though 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.580
 to me what I like most about the taquitos 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.080
 of wood in the vein that it has then 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.340
 I do not know I liked it very much 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.920
 result and I think he deserved 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.350
 quite worth it and nothing good if to you 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.870
