sensor then dragon had a videos and well
he<00:00:19.109> out<00:00:19.230> showed<00:00:19.650> his<00:00:20.900> heartbeat<00:00:21.900> sensor<00:00:22.170> and

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
he out showed his heartbeat sensor and

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.009 
he out showed his heartbeat sensor and
he's<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.340> wanted<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:23.789> see<00:00:24.240> if<00:00:24.359> anybody<00:00:24.810> can

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
he's it and wanted to see if anybody can

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.240 
he's it and wanted to see if anybody can
make<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.439> working<00:00:25.800> one<00:00:27.109> which<00:00:28.109> would<00:00:28.380> be<00:00:28.590> hard

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
make a working one which would be hard

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.970 
make a working one which would be hard
but<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.820> did<00:00:30.599> one<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:31.230> kinda<00:00:31.500> have<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.679> turn

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
but I did one you kinda have to turn

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.090 
but I did one you kinda have to turn
stuff<00:00:32.369> for<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.940> work<00:00:33.380> the<00:00:34.380> patterns<00:00:34.860> a

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
stuff for it to work the patterns a

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.569 
stuff for it to work the patterns a
little<00:00:35.640> hard<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.360> see<00:00:36.630> because<00:00:37.190> these<00:00:38.190> black

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
little hard to see because these black

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.970 
little hard to see because these black
parts<00:00:39.090> let's<00:00:39.780> see<00:00:39.930> if<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.170> can<00:00:40.200> get<00:00:40.500> those<00:00:40.680> white

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
turn from it has to turn from under over

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:50.450 
turn from it has to turn from under over
I<00:01:36.930> can't<00:01:37.890> go<00:01:38.100> from<00:01:38.340> over<00:01:38.700> under<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:41.540> so<00:01:48.920> and<00:01:49.920> it

doesn't do the cool faint of the fin te
thing<00:01:53.040> where<00:01:53.280> like<00:01:53.310> flips<00:01:54.030> down<00:01:54.659> in<00:01:55.079> real<00:01:55.350> life

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
thing where like flips down in real life

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.940 
thing where like flips down in real life
or<00:01:55.920> how<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.729> didn't<00:01:57.030> drag<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.420> had<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.860> kind<00:01:58.860> of

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
or how I didn't drag and had a kind of

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.389 
or how I didn't drag and had a kind of
