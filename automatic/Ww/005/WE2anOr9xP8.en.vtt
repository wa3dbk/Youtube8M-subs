the<00:00:20.800> only<00:00:20.890> other<00:00:21.190> deck<00:00:21.490> on<00:00:21.640> the<00:00:21.760> market<00:00:22.120> that

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
the only other deck on the market that

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.060 
the only other deck on the market that
has<00:00:22.420> a<00:00:22.450> head<00:00:22.720> tube<00:00:22.930> somewhat<00:00:23.470> similar<00:00:23.920> would

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 
has a head tube somewhat similar would

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.340 
has a head tube somewhat similar would
probably<00:00:24.460> be<00:00:24.550> an<00:00:24.640> attic<00:00:24.940> deck<00:00:25.150> and<00:00:25.360> the<00:00:25.990> reason

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:26.350 
probably be an attic deck and the reason

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.650 
probably be an attic deck and the reason
being<00:00:26.500> is<00:00:26.770> that<00:00:27.010> the<00:00:27.310> owner<00:00:27.550> of<00:00:27.789> ethic<00:00:28.150> Kevin

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
being is that the owner of ethic Kevin

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.119 
being is that the owner of ethic Kevin
de<00:00:28.810> may<00:00:29.340> also<00:00:30.340> at<00:00:30.850> a<00:00:30.910> time<00:00:31.480> was<00:00:32.379> part<00:00:32.649> of<00:00:32.739> addict

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:33.129 
de may also at a time was part of addict

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:35.970 
de may also at a time was part of addict
and<00:00:33.280> he<00:00:33.809> designed<00:00:34.809> their<00:00:35.079> decks<00:00:35.350> for<00:00:35.680> the<00:00:35.770> most

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
and he designed their decks for the most

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.770 
and he designed their decks for the most
part<00:00:36.250> and<00:00:36.460> I<00:00:36.520> know<00:00:36.579> he's<00:00:36.940> also<00:00:37.239> designed<00:00:37.600> some

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
part and I know he's also designed some

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.510 
part and I know he's also designed some
products<00:00:38.170> for<00:00:38.350> district<00:00:38.829> and<00:00:38.980> Eagle<00:00:39.220> sport

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
products for district and Eagle sport

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.440 
products for district and Eagle sport
and<00:00:39.670> pretty<00:00:39.820> much<00:00:39.940> helped<00:00:40.270> the<00:00:40.329> whole

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450 
and pretty much helped the whole

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.410 
and pretty much helped the whole
European<00:00:40.960> scene<00:00:41.260> so<00:00:42.040> now<00:00:42.310> ethic<00:00:42.910> is<00:00:43.060> kind<00:00:43.300> of

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
European scene so now ethic is kind of

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.500 
European scene so now ethic is kind of
his<00:00:43.570> baby<00:00:43.899> and<00:00:44.290> he's<00:00:45.280> put<00:00:45.550> all<00:00:45.820> of<00:00:45.850> his<00:00:46.090> design

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
his baby and he's put all of his design

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.530 
his baby and he's put all of his design
work<00:00:46.750> into<00:00:47.410> these<00:00:47.649> Lindwurm<00:00:48.070> decks<00:00:48.460> so<00:00:49.210> the

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 
work into these Lindwurm decks so the

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.110 
work into these Lindwurm decks so the
head<00:00:49.720> tube<00:00:49.930> angle<00:00:50.590> is<00:00:50.800> eighty<00:00:51.130> two<00:00:51.340> point<00:00:51.850> five

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
head tube angle is eighty two point five

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.260 
head tube angle is eighty two point five
degrees<00:00:52.570> which<00:00:52.899> is<00:00:53.200> a<00:00:54.100> pretty<00:00:54.579> pretty<00:00:55.030> good

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
degrees which is a pretty pretty good

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.700 
degrees which is a pretty pretty good
medium<00:00:55.780> and<00:00:55.989> then<00:00:56.410> it<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:58.500> five<00:00:59.500> hundred

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
medium and then it is five hundred

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.639 
medium and then it is five hundred
thirty<00:01:00.130> millimeters<00:01:00.850> long<00:01:01.180> which<00:01:01.930> is<00:01:01.960> twenty

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
thirty millimeters long which is twenty

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.030 
thirty millimeters long which is twenty
point<00:01:02.950> eight<00:01:03.129> inches<00:01:03.640> so<00:01:04.390> it's<00:01:05.320> not<00:01:05.530> too<00:01:05.890> much

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
point eight inches so it's not too much

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.529 
point eight inches so it's not too much
of<00:01:06.189> a<00:01:06.250> cramped<00:01:06.610> up<00:01:06.700> deck<00:01:06.969> there's<00:01:07.210> a<00:01:07.299> little

00:01:07.529 --> 00:01:07.539 
of a cramped up deck there's a little

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:09.239 
of a cramped up deck there's a little
bit<00:01:07.659> of<00:01:07.749> room<00:01:07.929> and<00:01:08.289> then<00:01:08.409> it's<00:01:08.979> a<00:01:09.100> hundred

00:01:09.239 --> 00:01:09.249 
bit of room and then it's a hundred

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:12.959 
bit of room and then it's a hundred
fourteen<00:01:09.999> millimeters<00:01:10.689> wide<00:01:10.959> which<00:01:11.709> is<00:01:12.039> four

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:12.969 
fourteen millimeters wide which is four

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:15.510 
fourteen millimeters wide which is four
point<00:01:13.420> four<00:01:13.780> eight<00:01:14.020> inches<00:01:14.560> so<00:01:15.159> it's<00:01:15.310> about

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
point four eight inches so it's about

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.699 
point four eight inches so it's about
your<00:01:15.700> average<00:01:15.939> four<00:01:16.600> point<00:01:16.840> five<00:01:17.049> inch<00:01:17.469> by

00:01:17.699 --> 00:01:17.709 
your average four point five inch by

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:20.519 
your average four point five inch by
twenty<00:01:18.159> one<00:01:18.189> deck<00:01:18.579> but<00:01:18.969> the<00:01:19.869> geometry<00:01:20.049> is<00:01:20.469> a

00:01:20.519 --> 00:01:20.529 
twenty one deck but the geometry is a

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:22.080 
twenty one deck but the geometry is a
little<00:01:20.770> bit<00:01:20.889> different<00:01:21.310> and<00:01:21.429> Kevin<00:01:21.759> did<00:01:21.909> that

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
little bit different and Kevin did that

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.019 
little bit different and Kevin did that
specifically<00:01:22.899> so<00:01:23.859> it<00:01:24.189> would<00:01:24.340> tailwhip<00:01:24.789> good

00:01:25.019 --> 00:01:25.029 
specifically so it would tailwhip good

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:27.120 
specifically so it would tailwhip good
if<00:01:25.209> you<00:01:25.359> a<00:01:25.659> lot<00:01:26.020> of<00:01:26.170> the<00:01:26.259> front<00:01:26.560> a<00:01:26.709> lot<00:01:26.950> of<00:01:27.069> the

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
if you a lot of the front a lot of the

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.559 
if you a lot of the front a lot of the
weight<00:01:27.310> is<00:01:27.549> more<00:01:27.759> towards<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:28.209> front<00:01:28.450> of<00:01:28.509> the

00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:28.569 
weight is more towards the front of the

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:30.809 
weight is more towards the front of the
deck<00:01:28.810> so<00:01:29.049> they<00:01:29.170> feel<00:01:29.469> I've<00:01:30.100> heard<00:01:30.429> writers

00:01:30.809 --> 00:01:30.819 
deck so they feel I've heard writers

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:32.849 
deck so they feel I've heard writers
tell<00:01:31.060> me<00:01:31.179> they<00:01:31.299> feel<00:01:31.479> extremely<00:01:32.049> balanced<00:01:32.679> and

they just feel very designed to scooter

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.769 
they just feel very designed to scooter

little<00:02:02.109> extra<00:02:02.469> and<00:02:02.649> then<00:02:02.770> if<00:02:02.889> you<00:02:02.979> look<00:02:03.159> at<00:02:03.219> the

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:05.969 
little extra and then if you look at the
break<00:02:03.939> it<00:02:04.179> has<00:02:04.299> a<00:02:04.329> really<00:02:04.569> interesting<00:02:04.979> break
