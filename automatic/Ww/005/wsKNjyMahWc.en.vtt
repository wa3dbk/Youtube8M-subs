going<00:00:02.520> to<00:00:02.580> be<00:00:02.669> introducing<00:00:02.909> a<00:00:03.330> very<00:00:03.810> cool

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
going to be introducing a very cool

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.820 
going to be introducing a very cool
concept<00:00:04.529> on<00:00:05.040> the<00:00:05.160> NCIX<00:00:05.759> website<00:00:06.270> now<00:00:06.620> NCIX<00:00:07.620> has

concept on the NCIX website now NCIX has
had<00:00:07.980> it<00:00:08.099> figured<00:00:08.280> out<00:00:08.490> for<00:00:08.760> a<00:00:08.820> long<00:00:09.059> time<00:00:09.389> that

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
had it figured out for a long time that

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.450 
had it figured out for a long time that
we<00:00:09.750> should<00:00:09.929> allow<00:00:10.170> users<00:00:10.620> to<00:00:10.650> build<00:00:11.190> computers

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
a new PC we are implementing a

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.770 
a new PC we are implementing a
compatibility<00:00:40.950> checker<00:00:41.489> on<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.300> website

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
compatibility checker on the website

compatibility checker on the website
very<00:00:43.290> cool<00:00:43.620> concept<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:44.280> what<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.550> does<00:00:44.760> right

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
very cool concept of what it does right

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.810 
very cool concept of what it does right
now<00:00:45.090> in<00:00:45.600> its<00:00:45.780> beta<00:00:46.050> form<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:47.160> actually<00:00:47.640> goes

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
now in its beta form is it actually goes

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.970 
now in its beta form is it actually goes
through<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:48.180> couple<00:00:48.570> basic<00:00:48.989> components<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:49.829> the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
through a couple basic components in the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.920 
through a couple basic components in the
system<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.489> users<00:00:51.120> often<00:00:51.629> make<00:00:51.780> mistakes

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
system that users often make mistakes

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.439 
system that users often make mistakes
with<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.649> verifies<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.340> they<00:00:53.850> are<00:00:54.000> indeed

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
with and verifies that they are indeed

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.229 
with and verifies that they are indeed
compatible<00:00:55.320> I'll<00:00:55.530> show<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.829> how<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.129> works<00:00:56.309> so

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
compatible I'll show you how it works so

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.790 
compatible I'll show you how it works so
before<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.570> go<00:00:57.750> into<00:00:57.960> too<00:00:58.109> much<00:00:58.140> depth<00:00:58.559> about

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
before I go into too much depth about

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.860 
before I go into too much depth about
the<00:00:59.090> mechanism<00:01:00.090> itself<00:01:00.390> why<00:01:00.600> don't<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:00.840> show

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
the mechanism itself why don't I show

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.240 
the mechanism itself why don't I show
you<00:01:00.989> all<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.440> different<00:01:01.739> places<00:01:01.920> you're

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
not buying a preassembled PC you can

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.410 
not buying a preassembled PC you can
still<00:01:52.320> do<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.530> basic<00:01:53.009> compatibility<00:01:53.939> check<00:01:54.240> if

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
still do a basic compatibility check if

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.060 
still do a basic compatibility check if
you're<00:01:54.780> buying<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.170> system<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.710> assemble

here the compatible motherboards with

here the compatible motherboards with
these<00:02:49.560> processors<00:02:50.159> are<00:02:50.310> LGA<00:02:50.760> 1155<00:02:51.389> so<00:02:51.840> it

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
these processors are LGA 1155 so it

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.330 
these processors are LGA 1155 so it
tells<00:02:52.109> me<00:02:52.319> how<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.530> find<00:02:52.829> something<00:02:53.189> that<00:02:53.219> is

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
tells me how to find something that is

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.399 
tells me how to find something that is
compatible<00:02:53.819> and<00:02:54.209> then<00:02:54.689> the<00:02:54.810> attributes

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:55.409 
compatible and then the attributes

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:57.319 
compatible and then the attributes
detected<00:02:55.859> for<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.069> motherboard<00:02:56.340> are<00:02:56.790> a.m.<00:02:57.000> 3

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.689 
detected for the motherboard are a.m. 3
a.m.<00:02:57.359> 3<00:02:57.780> plus<00:02:58.019> crossfire<00:02:58.530> SATA<00:02:58.829> 3<00:02:58.889> and<00:02:59.129> USB<00:02:59.340> 3

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:02.149 
a.m. 3 plus crossfire SATA 3 and USB 3
so<00:03:00.180> these<00:03:00.359> two<00:03:00.599> are<00:03:00.840> not<00:03:00.989> compatible<00:03:01.379> and<00:03:01.739> it

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
so these two are not compatible and it

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:04.009 
so these two are not compatible and it
can<00:03:02.340> actually<00:03:02.730> find<00:03:02.939> a<00:03:03.150> number<00:03:03.569> of<00:03:03.689> different

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
based around the motherboard so if you

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.009 
based around the motherboard so if you

heatsink that fits on top of that now

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:26.960 
heatsink that fits on top of that now
I've<00:03:25.409> talked<00:03:25.709> about<00:03:25.889> what's<00:03:26.220> good<00:03:26.579> about<00:03:26.699> the

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
I've talked about what's good about the

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.580 
I've talked about what's good about the
compatibility<00:03:27.269> checks<00:03:27.989> so<00:03:28.169> far<00:03:28.409> but<00:03:28.530> I

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
compatibility checks so far but I

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:29.659 
compatibility checks so far but I
haven't<00:03:28.829> talked<00:03:29.129> about<00:03:29.280> any<00:03:29.489> of<00:03:29.609> the

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:29.669 
haven't talked about any of the

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:31.640 
haven't talked about any of the
limitations<00:03:30.329> so<00:03:30.569> have<00:03:31.139> a<00:03:31.169> look<00:03:31.379> at<00:03:31.500> this

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
limitations so have a look at this

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.999 
limitations so have a look at this
dialog<00:03:32.129> here<00:03:32.840> you<00:03:33.840> can<00:03:34.019> see<00:03:34.199> that<00:03:34.379> we've<00:03:34.530> said

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:35.009 
dialog here you can see that we've said

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:36.979 
dialog here you can see that we've said
they're<00:03:35.310> not<00:03:35.459> compatible<00:03:35.849> but<00:03:36.599> we<00:03:36.750> haven't

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
they're not compatible but we haven't

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.899 
they're not compatible but we haven't
recommended<00:03:37.829> a<00:03:38.009> motherboard<00:03:38.489> that<00:03:38.669> is

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:38.909 
recommended a motherboard that is

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:40.909 
recommended a motherboard that is
compatible<00:03:39.449> with<00:03:39.509> that<00:03:39.720> CPU<00:03:40.109> or<00:03:40.199> a<00:03:40.409> CPU<00:03:40.799> that

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919 
compatible with that CPU or a CPU that

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:42.740 
compatible with that CPU or a CPU that
is<00:03:41.159> compatible<00:03:41.579> with<00:03:41.819> that<00:03:42.060> motherboard<00:03:42.540> that

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
is compatible with that motherboard that

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.719 
is compatible with that motherboard that
functionality<00:03:43.680> is<00:03:43.919> something<00:03:44.310> that<00:03:44.459> we<00:03:44.579> will

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:44.729 
functionality is something that we will

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:47.539 
functionality is something that we will
be<00:03:44.790> looking<00:03:45.209> at<00:03:45.329> adding<00:03:45.720> in<00:03:45.989> the<00:03:46.620> near<00:03:46.650> future

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
be looking at adding in the near future

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.879 
be looking at adding in the near future
so<00:03:48.030> that's<00:03:48.540> one<00:03:48.930> cool<00:03:49.169> thing<00:03:49.229> that's<00:03:49.590> coming

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
so that's one cool thing that's coming

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:51.949 
so that's one cool thing that's coming
we're<00:03:50.009> also<00:03:50.129> going<00:03:50.430> to<00:03:50.519> be<00:03:50.729> adding<00:03:50.909> a<00:03:51.269> feedback

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
we're also going to be adding a feedback

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.960 
we're also going to be adding a feedback
link<00:03:52.229> so<00:03:52.709> if<00:03:52.919> you<00:03:53.159> are<00:03:53.430> using<00:03:53.729> the

link so if you are using the

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.550 
link so if you are using the
compatibility<00:03:54.659> check<00:03:54.870> feature<00:03:55.019> and<00:03:55.290> you<00:03:55.349> find
