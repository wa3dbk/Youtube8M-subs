00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.570
 totally new 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.230
 there was the dispute of buying this game 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:27.810
 mario kart wii or even better prime but 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.970

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.380
 they have 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.820
 which is better than when it 's new this 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.160
 game 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.630
 besides that this game 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:49.670

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:52.660

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.530
 and then all the nintendo characters 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.530
 we open it and 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.989
 the internal club code 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.989
 good here is the destination 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.830
 here is the code 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.660
 I'll take you if they want to grab the code I 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.510
 and then power in my account before 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:19.820
 upload the video so no way this is 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:22.550
 a photo of the seems is my world road 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:27.790
 and things come from the membership of the 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.790
 games and stuff up is in Spanish 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.790
 liberties classes everything is the code 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.470
 bread if you want but we will 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.160
 It also comes in three recommendations 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:41.340
 how is it mario sports mix zelda spirit 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.500
 tracks and super mario galaxy 3 in case 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.840
 they also liked things from the console 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.840
 virtual as well as wiiware 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.760
 that spirit is very good when mario 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.820
 it's portable 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:58.270
 they are the recommendations besides it comes a 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.470
 manual that is so great is 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.030
 chubby now yes 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:05.390
 and it looks like it's in color 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.300
 but it is in English 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.390
 but that does not mean that we do not know 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.240
 English because the basics that tells you how 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.090
 play with some besides you pay for your 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.720
 notes um but good half is in 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.190
 Spanish in case you did not know 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.190
 That is something good 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:29.740
 the best and the disk in case they have not 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:33.160
 seen it would be very beautiful the game 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.080
 it's a very good game to win so 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.900
 if they did not play 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.990
 this does not have to play and then no more 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:45.000
 no less this is all mario greets 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.000
 see you until next time
