00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.840 
so that's for warranty purposes two
things<00:04:15.480> with<00:04:15.690> rooting<00:04:16.410> and<00:04:16.560> unlocking<00:04:16.979> is<00:04:17.340> the

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
things with rooting and unlocking is the

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.140 
things with rooting and unlocking is the
fact<00:04:18.060> that<00:04:18.150> it<00:04:18.329> avoids<00:04:18.959> your<00:04:19.229> warranty<00:04:20.150> but

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
fact that it avoids your warranty but

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.440 
fact that it avoids your warranty but
there's<00:04:21.570> no<00:04:21.780> way<00:04:22.200> that<00:04:22.590> there<00:04:23.010> is<00:04:23.100> a<00:04:23.130> way<00:04:23.370> of

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
there's no way that there is a way of

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.550 
there's no way that there is a way of
bringing<00:04:24.450> it<00:04:24.660> back<00:04:24.750> as<00:04:24.990> you<00:04:25.110> can<00:04:25.200> see<00:04:25.380> just

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
bringing it back as you can see just

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.680 
bringing it back as you can see just
doing<00:04:25.800> that<00:04:25.950> or<00:04:26.100> on<00:04:26.250> routing<00:04:26.700> it's<00:04:27.240> very<00:04:27.450> easy

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
doing that or on routing it's very easy

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.620 
doing that or on routing it's very easy
to<00:04:27.840> do<00:04:28.110> and<00:04:28.639> when<00:04:29.639> you<00:04:29.790> do<00:04:29.970> when<00:04:30.270> you're<00:04:30.389> on<00:04:30.510> the
