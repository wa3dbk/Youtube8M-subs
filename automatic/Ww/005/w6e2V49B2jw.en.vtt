00:00:35.779 --> 00:00:35.789 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:40.110 

can<00:00:36.789> you<00:00:37.059> mentally<00:00:37.780> find<00:00:38.140> out<00:00:38.440> what<00:00:39.250> is<00:00:39.430> 13

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
can you mentally find out what is 13

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.030 
can you mentally find out what is 13
times<00:00:40.750> 12<00:00:41.140> in<00:00:41.890> three<00:00:42.730> second<00:00:43.120> status<00:00:43.570> I<00:00:44.040> know

times 12 in three second status I know

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.870 
times 12 in three second status I know
that<00:00:45.400> you<00:00:45.520> can<00:00:45.760> so<00:00:46.480> give<00:00:46.900> it<00:00:46.930> a<00:00:47.079> try<00:00:47.700> your<00:00:48.700> time

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:48.880 
that you can so give it a try your time

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.370 
that you can so give it a try your time
starts<00:00:49.300> now

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:52.380 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.090 

your<00:00:53.380> times<00:00:53.560> over<00:00:53.950> well<00:00:54.760> if<00:00:55.000> your<00:00:55.329> answer<00:00:55.750> was

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
your times over well if your answer was

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.819 
your times over well if your answer was
156<00:00:57.120> then<00:00:58.120> that's<00:00:58.390> terrific<00:00:59.020> because<00:00:59.559> you<00:00:59.739> are

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
156 then that's terrific because you are

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:01.560 
156 then that's terrific because you are
calculating<00:01:00.070> faster<00:01:00.790> than<00:01:00.940> the<00:01:01.059> calculator

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
calculating faster than the calculator

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.619 
calculating faster than the calculator
in<00:01:02.380> case<00:01:02.800> you<00:01:03.220> could<00:01:03.430> not<00:01:03.460> calculate<00:01:04.059> at<00:01:04.239> all

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
in case you could not calculate at all

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.709 
in case you could not calculate at all
not<00:01:05.170> to<00:01:05.379> worry<00:01:05.590> for<00:01:05.860> you<00:01:06.399> know<00:01:06.579> that<00:01:07.119> in<00:01:07.390> next

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:07.719 
not to worry for you know that in next

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:09.840 
not to worry for you know that in next
four<00:01:08.110> minutes<00:01:08.439> you'll<00:01:08.979> be<00:01:09.130> able<00:01:09.250> to<00:01:09.549> multiply

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
four minutes you'll be able to multiply

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.590 
four minutes you'll be able to multiply
any<00:01:10.600> numbers<00:01:11.320> closer<00:01:12.100> to<00:01:12.370> base<00:01:12.580> ten<00:01:12.970> in<00:01:13.120> less

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
any numbers closer to base ten in less

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.110 
any numbers closer to base ten in less
than<00:01:13.630> three<00:01:13.960> seconds<00:01:14.350> so<00:01:17.400> let's<00:01:18.400> see<00:01:18.970> the

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120 
than three seconds so let's see the

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:25.880 
than three seconds so let's see the
useful<00:01:19.659> way<00:01:19.840> of<00:01:20.100> multiplying<00:01:21.100> 13<00:01:22.000> with<00:01:22.390> 12<00:01:24.690> so

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
useful way of multiplying 13 with 12 so

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:33.899 
useful way of multiplying 13 with 12 so
2<00:01:26.890> 3<00:01:27.100> times<00:01:27.340> is<00:01:27.960> 6<00:01:28.960> 2<00:01:29.890> 1<00:01:29.920> x<00:01:30.340> is<00:01:30.610> 2<00:01:31.619> 1<00:01:32.619> 3<00:01:32.770> times<00:01:33.070> is<00:01:33.340> 3

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
2 3 times is 6 2 1 x is 2 1 3 times is 3

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.980 
2 3 times is 6 2 1 x is 2 1 3 times is 3
1<00:01:34.780> 1<00:01:34.960> x<00:01:35.229> is<00:01:35.580> 1<00:01:36.580> now<00:01:37.119> add<00:01:37.330> the<00:01:37.510> numbers<00:01:37.780> in<00:01:37.900> the

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
1 1 x is 1 now add the numbers in the

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.050 
1 1 x is 1 now add the numbers in the
column<00:01:38.200> so<00:01:38.979> 6<00:01:39.340> 3<00:01:39.880> plus<00:01:40.090> 2<00:01:40.270> is<00:01:40.299> 5<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:42.070> this<00:01:42.490> is<00:01:42.700> 1

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
column so 6 3 plus 2 is 5 and this is 1

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.200 
column so 6 3 plus 2 is 5 and this is 1
I<00:01:43.680> know<00:01:44.680> you<00:01:44.860> must<00:01:45.159> be<00:01:45.250> getting<00:01:45.580> impatient

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
I know you must be getting impatient

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.810 
I know you must be getting impatient
you<00:01:46.689> must<00:01:46.930> be<00:01:47.049> saying<00:01:47.350> that<00:01:47.650> cut<00:01:48.250> this<00:01:48.400> harder

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
you must be saying that cut this harder

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.850 
you must be saying that cut this harder
way<00:01:48.939> I'm<00:01:49.570> already<00:01:49.840> sick<00:01:50.140> and<00:01:50.290> tired<00:01:50.439> of<00:01:50.650> it

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
way I'm already sick and tired of it

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.149 
way I'm already sick and tired of it
show<00:01:51.610> me<00:01:51.790> the<00:01:51.909> smarter<00:01:52.270> way<00:01:52.390> so<00:01:53.290> here<00:01:53.860> is<00:01:54.009> your

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
show me the smarter way so here is your

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.550 
show me the smarter way so here is your
smarter<00:01:54.549> way<00:01:54.700> the<00:01:55.600> smarter<00:01:56.350> way<00:01:56.530> of

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
smarter way the smarter way of

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.039 
smarter way the smarter way of
multiplying<00:01:57.479> 13<00:01:58.479> with<00:01:59.229> 12<00:01:59.920> is<00:02:00.159> the<00:02:00.759> same<00:02:01.390> base

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
multiplying 13 with 12 is the same base

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.130 
multiplying 13 with 12 is the same base
method<00:02:02.680> of<00:02:02.829> multiplication<00:02:03.670> that<00:02:04.630> we<00:02:04.689> learned

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
method of multiplication that we learned

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.669 
method of multiplication that we learned
in<00:02:05.380> the<00:02:05.560> last<00:02:05.950> class<00:02:06.400> and<00:02:06.729> yes<00:02:07.600> you<00:02:08.289> guessed<00:02:08.500> it

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
in the last class and yes you guessed it

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.899 
in the last class and yes you guessed it
right<00:02:08.799> the<00:02:09.159> base<00:02:09.340> here<00:02:09.700> is<00:02:09.879> 10<00:02:11.040> so<00:02:12.040> since<00:02:12.280> 12<00:02:12.670> is

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:12.909 
right the base here is 10 so since 12 is

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:15.750 
right the base here is 10 so since 12 is
2<00:02:13.150> more<00:02:13.329> than<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.689> base<00:02:13.900> so<00:02:14.260> add<00:02:14.470> this<00:02:14.739> 2<00:02:15.069> that

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
2 more than the base so add this 2 that

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.630 
2 more than the base so add this 2 that
is<00:02:15.940> this<00:02:16.180> digit<00:02:16.660> to<00:02:17.050> this<00:02:17.200> entire<00:02:17.800> number<00:02:18.250> 13

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
is this digit to this entire number 13

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.760 
is this digit to this entire number 13
plus<00:02:18.849> 2<00:02:19.030> is

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
plus 2 is

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.140 
plus 2 is
15<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.610> since<00:02:21.270> base<00:02:21.540> 10<00:02:22.290> has<00:02:22.620> one<00:02:22.950> zero<00:02:23.280> so

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
15 and since base 10 has one zero so

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.870 
15 and since base 10 has one zero so
there<00:02:24.570> is<00:02:24.600> one<00:02:24.900> place<00:02:25.140> more<00:02:25.410> to<00:02:25.590> go<00:02:25.740> 3<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.430> x<00:02:26.610> is

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
there is one place more to go 3 to x is

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.230 
there is one place more to go 3 to x is
six<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.170> that's<00:02:28.590> your<00:02:28.830> answer<00:02:29.000> isn't<00:02:30.000> that

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
six and that's your answer isn't that

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.830 
six and that's your answer isn't that
simple

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
simple

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.780 
simple
you<00:02:31.800> bet<00:02:32.010> it<00:02:32.190> is<00:02:32.600> okay<00:02:33.600> so<00:02:34.250> let's<00:02:35.250> take<00:02:35.490> one

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
you bet it is okay so let's take one

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.360 
you bet it is okay so let's take one
more<00:02:35.970> example<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.720> this<00:02:37.380> time<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:38.040> try<00:02:38.310> to

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
more example and this time you try to

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.630 
more example and this time you try to
solve<00:02:38.670> it<00:02:39.620> okay<00:02:40.620> there<00:02:41.160> you<00:02:41.190> go

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
solve it okay there you go

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.740 
solve it okay there you go
what<00:02:42.300> is<00:02:42.950> 13<00:02:43.950> times<00:02:44.840> 13<00:02:46.820> okay<00:02:47.820> so<00:02:48.300> first<00:02:48.540> thing

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
what is 13 times 13 okay so first thing

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.210 
what is 13 times 13 okay so first thing
you<00:02:48.960> did<00:02:49.560> was<00:02:49.770> to<00:02:50.340> add<00:02:50.580> this<00:02:51.030> 3<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:51.660> this<00:02:52.650> entire

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
you did was to add this 3 to this entire

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.160 
you did was to add this 3 to this entire
number<00:02:53.640> 13<00:02:54.150> plus<00:02:54.360> 3<00:02:54.390> is<00:02:54.920> 16<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.480> 3<00:02:57.480> 3<00:02:57.690> times<00:02:57.960> is

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
number 13 plus 3 is 16 and 3 3 times is

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.980 
number 13 plus 3 is 16 and 3 3 times is
9<00:02:58.470> so<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:58.980> answer<00:02:59.310> is<00:02:59.360> 169<00:03:00.500> isn't<00:03:01.500> that<00:03:01.590> simple

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
9 so the answer is 169 isn't that simple

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.360 
9 so the answer is 169 isn't that simple
right

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
right

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.960 
right
ok<00:03:05.370> so<00:03:06.230> let's<00:03:07.230> take<00:03:07.470> one<00:03:07.650> more<00:03:07.800> example<00:03:07.860> and<00:03:08.460> be

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
ok so let's take one more example and be

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.360 
ok so let's take one more example and be
careful<00:03:09.390> this<00:03:09.510> time<00:03:09.750> because<00:03:10.350> I'm<00:03:10.950> going<00:03:11.250> to

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
careful this time because I'm going to

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.030 
careful this time because I'm going to
set<00:03:11.580> up<00:03:11.700> a<00:03:11.790> trap<00:03:12.000> for<00:03:12.030> you<00:03:14.030> what<00:03:15.030> is<00:03:15.770> let's<00:03:16.770> say

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
set up a trap for you what is let's say

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:27.140 
set up a trap for you what is let's say
16<00:03:17.900> times<00:03:18.900> 12<00:03:21.380> so<00:03:22.380> add<00:03:23.250> this<00:03:23.580> to<00:03:24.080> 216<00:03:25.820> 16<00:03:26.820> plus<00:03:27.000> 2

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
16 times 12 so add this to 216 16 plus 2

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.940 
16 times 12 so add this to 216 16 plus 2
is<00:03:27.270> 18<00:03:27.840> now<00:03:28.680> 6<00:03:29.250> 2<00:03:29.520> times<00:03:29.760> is<00:03:30.090> 12<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.260> you<00:03:31.800> know

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
is 18 now 6 2 times is 12 and you know

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.090 
is 18 now 6 2 times is 12 and you know
that<00:03:32.130> 12<00:03:32.430> is<00:03:32.580> a<00:03:32.610> to<00:03:33.060> date<00:03:33.240> number<00:03:33.480> so<00:03:34.380> and<00:03:34.620> there

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
that 12 is a to date number so and there

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.340 
that 12 is a to date number so and there
is<00:03:35.190> only<00:03:35.280> one<00:03:35.430> place<00:03:35.850> here<00:03:36.060> to<00:03:36.240> go<00:03:36.360> so<00:03:37.080> carry

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
is only one place here to go so carry

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.900 
is only one place here to go so carry
forward<00:03:37.770> 1<00:03:37.950> right<00:03:38.580> 2<00:03:38.610> here<00:03:39.180> so<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:39.690> answer<00:03:40.020> is

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
forward 1 right 2 here so the answer is

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.160 
forward 1 right 2 here so the answer is
192<00:03:42.620> isn't<00:03:43.620> it<00:03:43.800> so<00:03:44.459> this<00:03:44.640> way<00:03:44.850> see<00:03:45.510> these<00:03:45.990> are

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
192 isn't it so this way see these are

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.440 
192 isn't it so this way see these are
very<00:03:46.200> common<00:03:46.860> operations<00:03:47.430> no<00:03:47.970> matter<00:03:48.180> what

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
very common operations no matter what

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.880 
very common operations no matter what
question<00:03:48.600> of<00:03:48.990> mathematics<00:03:49.530> you<00:03:49.620> are<00:03:49.709> trying

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
question of mathematics you are trying

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.380 
question of mathematics you are trying
to<00:03:49.980> solve<00:03:50.280> you<00:03:50.520> have<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:50.940> multiply<00:03:51.090> the

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
to solve you have to multiply the

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.050 
to solve you have to multiply the
numbers<00:03:51.870> so<00:03:52.740> if<00:03:53.040> you<00:03:53.370> know<00:03:53.580> these<00:03:53.790> techniques

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
numbers so if you know these techniques

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.270 
numbers so if you know these techniques
then<00:03:54.720> you'll<00:03:54.930> be<00:03:55.050> able<00:03:55.140> to<00:03:55.380> multiply<00:03:55.680> quickly

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
then you'll be able to multiply quickly

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.110 
then you'll be able to multiply quickly
and<00:03:56.850> correctly<00:03:57.680> okay<00:03:58.680> so<00:03:59.100> before<00:03:59.610> we<00:03:59.790> end<00:04:00.000> this

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
and correctly okay so before we end this

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.290 
and correctly okay so before we end this
class<00:04:00.330> let<00:04:01.140> me<00:04:01.290> give<00:04:01.440> you<00:04:01.500> one<00:04:01.680> last<00:04:01.709> example

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
class let me give you one last example

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:12.290 
class let me give you one last example
what<00:04:03.300> is<00:04:04.640> let's<00:04:05.640> say<00:04:06.980> 18<00:04:07.980> times<00:04:09.320> 14<00:04:10.820> so<00:04:11.820> first

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
what is let's say 18 times 14 so first

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.440 
what is let's say 18 times 14 so first
thing<00:04:12.480> add<00:04:12.660> this<00:04:12.990> 4<00:04:13.290> to<00:04:13.530> 18<00:04:14.130> 18<00:04:14.970> plus<00:04:15.150> 4<00:04:15.390> is<00:04:15.560> 22

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
thing add this 4 to 18 18 plus 4 is 22

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:23.270 
thing add this 4 to 18 18 plus 4 is 22
right<00:04:18.560> so<00:04:19.790> 8<00:04:20.790> 4<00:04:21.450> times<00:04:21.600> is<00:04:21.930> 32<00:04:22.740> so<00:04:22.919> carry

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
right so 8 4 times is 32 so carry

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.900 
right so 8 4 times is 32 so carry
forward<00:04:23.669> 3<00:04:23.850> right<00:04:24.090> 2<00:04:24.120> here<00:04:24.570> 22<00:04:25.260> plus<00:04:25.590> 3<00:04:25.830> is<00:04:26.010> 25

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
forward 3 right 2 here 22 plus 3 is 25

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.050 
forward 3 right 2 here 22 plus 3 is 25
so<00:04:27.090> the<00:04:27.210> answer<00:04:27.480> is<00:04:27.510> 252

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
so the answer is 252

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.330 
so the answer is 252
that's<00:04:30.060> your<00:04:30.270> answer

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.820
