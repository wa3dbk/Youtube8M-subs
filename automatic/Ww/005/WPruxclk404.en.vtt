every<00:02:23.080> time<00:02:23.290> when<00:02:23.470> it<00:02:23.560> cuts<00:02:23.740> up<00:02:23.920> then<00:02:24.340> we<00:02:24.430> just

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
every time when it cuts up then we just

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.910 
every time when it cuts up then we just
old<00:02:24.790> bullet<00:02:25.060> passes<00:02:25.480> inside<00:02:25.840> click<00:02:26.500> on<00:02:26.650> for

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
old bullet passes inside click on for

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.850 
old bullet passes inside click on for
the<00:02:27.010> user<00:02:27.250> catch<00:02:27.550> now<00:02:28.270> why<00:02:28.780> do<00:02:28.840> we<00:02:29.110> have<00:02:29.290> the

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
the user catch now why do we have the

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.980 
the user catch now why do we have the
slot<00:02:30.340> receiver<00:02:30.670> on<00:02:30.760> a<00:02:30.790> streak<00:02:31.120> well<00:02:31.630> he's<00:02:31.810> on<00:02:31.960> a

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
slot receiver on a streak well he's on a

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.750 
slot receiver on a streak well he's on a
street<00:02:32.320> because<00:02:32.740> streaks<00:02:33.100> are<00:02:33.280> very<00:02:33.520> very

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
street because streaks are very very

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.430 
street because streaks are very very
easy<00:02:34.030> to<00:02:34.240> use<00:02:34.270> her<00:02:34.510> catch<00:02:34.750> against<00:02:35.290> own

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
easy to use her catch against own

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.830 
easy to use her catch against own
coverage<00:02:35.830> secondly<00:02:36.730> he's<00:02:36.880> on<00:02:37.030> a<00:02:37.060> streak<00:02:37.360> so<00:02:37.600> at

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
coverage secondly he's on a streak so at

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.750 
coverage secondly he's on a streak so at
their<00:02:37.990> man<00:02:38.260> coverage<00:02:38.740> to<00:02:38.920> safety<00:02:39.310> has<00:02:39.460> to<00:02:39.580> stay

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
their man coverage to safety has to stay

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.550 
their man coverage to safety has to stay
over<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.090> top<00:02:40.300> as<00:02:40.510> soon<00:02:40.660> as<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.960> safety<00:02:41.140> comes

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
over the top as soon as the safety comes

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.800 
over the top as soon as the safety comes
down<00:02:41.860> to<00:02:42.400> try<00:02:42.610> to<00:02:42.670> cover<00:02:42.940> this<00:02:43.240> user<00:02:43.480> catcher

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
down to try to cover this user catcher

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.620 
down to try to cover this user catcher
out<00:02:44.020> we're<00:02:44.380> bonding<00:02:44.770> you<00:02:44.890> for<00:02:45.070> a<00:02:45.130> touchdown

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
out we're bonding you for a touchdown

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.330 
out we're bonding you for a touchdown
secondly<00:02:46.630> why<00:02:47.140> is<00:02:47.200> the<00:02:47.620> running<00:02:47.800> background<00:02:48.070> a

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
secondly why is the running background a

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.100 
secondly why is the running background a
playground<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:49.060> running<00:02:49.360> back<00:02:49.480> is<00:02:49.660> on<00:02:49.780> m'lady

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
playground the running back is on m'lady

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.410 
playground the running back is on m'lady
bro<00:02:50.230> so<00:02:50.920> that<00:02:51.160> if<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.580> defense<00:02:51.910> tries<00:02:52.120> to<00:02:52.270> play

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
bro so that if the defense tries to play

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.870 
bro so that if the defense tries to play
all-out<00:02:52.690> coverage<00:02:53.320> basically<00:02:53.890> a<00:02:53.920> man<00:02:54.310> defense

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
all-out coverage basically a man defense

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.360 
all-out coverage basically a man defense
while<00:02:55.150> dropping<00:02:55.360> back<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:56.560> defensive

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
while dropping back the defensive

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.610 
while dropping back the defensive

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
lineman in under the zones the running

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.250

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
wheel route to throw even if it's all

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.250 
wheel route to throw even if it's all
coach<00:03:09.060> let's<00:03:10.060> look<00:03:10.209> at<00:03:10.390> more<00:03:10.630> options<00:03:11.080> we<00:03:11.230> have

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
coach let's look at more options we have

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.680 
coach let's look at more options we have
on<00:03:11.680> this<00:03:11.770> play<00:03:12.040> other<00:03:12.310> than<00:03:12.520> the<00:03:12.850> left<00:03:13.090> side<00:03:13.510> of

on this play other than the left side of
the<00:03:13.810> field<00:03:17.459> now<00:03:18.459> you<00:03:18.520> will<00:03:18.850> see<00:03:18.880> here<00:03:19.360> Macklin

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
the field now you will see here Macklin

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.590 
the field now you will see here Macklin
is<00:03:20.470> running<00:03:20.830> an<00:03:21.010> absolutely<00:03:21.670> extraordinary

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
is running an absolutely extraordinary

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.830 
is running an absolutely extraordinary
really<00:03:23.590> unique<00:03:24.040> route<00:03:24.310> this<00:03:25.300> route<00:03:25.510> kills

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
really unique route this route kills

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.229 
really unique route this route kills
everything<00:03:26.290> man<00:03:26.920> horizontal<00:03:27.730> you<00:03:27.850> name<00:03:28.060> it

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
everything man horizontal you name it

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.990 
everything man horizontal you name it
look<00:03:28.840> at<00:03:28.959> this<00:03:29.280> this<00:03:30.280> is<00:03:30.340> another<00:03:30.730> rather

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
look at this this is another rather

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.180 
look at this this is another rather
cannot<00:03:31.420> be<00:03:31.570> affected<00:03:31.989> by<00:03:32.080> coverage<00:03:32.470> d<00:03:32.680> because

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
cannot be affected by coverage d because

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.790 
cannot be affected by coverage d because
it<00:03:33.430> is<00:03:33.730> to<00:03:34.030> be<00:03:34.239> most<00:03:34.810> corner<00:03:35.200> routes<00:03:35.410> can<00:03:35.650> be

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
it is to be most corner routes can be

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.620 
it is to be most corner routes can be
locked<00:03:36.040> up<00:03:36.220> by<00:03:36.430> defensive<00:03:37.030> and<00:03:37.120> purple<00:03:37.450> zone

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
locked up by defensive and purple zone

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.830 
locked up by defensive and purple zone
and<00:03:37.989> man<00:03:38.590> coverage<00:03:38.980> not<00:03:39.190> this<00:03:39.340> one<00:03:39.519> now<00:03:40.390> how<00:03:40.780> do

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
and man coverage not this one now how do

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.900 
and man coverage not this one now how do
we<00:03:41.019> actually<00:03:41.170> keep<00:03:41.410> this<00:03:41.530> round<00:03:41.769> basically<00:03:42.400> we

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
we actually keep this round basically we

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.210 
we actually keep this round basically we
let<00:03:43.360> it<00:03:43.480> cut<00:03:43.720> up<00:03:43.900> see<00:03:44.530> it's<00:03:44.680> cutting<00:03:44.920> up<00:03:45.040> at<00:03:45.190> a

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
let it cut up see it's cutting up at a

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.640 
let it cut up see it's cutting up at a
deep<00:03:45.489> angle<00:03:45.850> unlike<00:03:46.450> hardened<00:03:46.989> that<00:03:47.440> most

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
deep angle unlike hardened that most

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.130
