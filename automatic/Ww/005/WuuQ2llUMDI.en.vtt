pretty<00:00:33.300> much<00:00:33.390> bleached<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.320> from<00:00:34.559> here<00:00:34.770> down

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010

start<00:00:35.760> off<00:00:35.880> with<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.660> then<00:00:36.780> realized<00:00:37.110> the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
start off with and then realized the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.350 
start off with and then realized the
bleach<00:00:37.770> did<00:00:38.040> not<00:00:38.160> go<00:00:38.399> up<00:00:38.489> high<00:00:38.730> enough<00:00:38.910> and

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
bleach did not go up high enough and

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.240 
bleach did not go up high enough and
also<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.230> realized<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.649> didn't<00:00:40.890> want<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.129> be

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.510 
also I realized I didn't want it to be
that<00:00:41.550> blonde<00:00:42.530> so<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.559> went<00:00:43.800> in<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.250> dyed<00:00:44.489> it

brown<00:00:44.789> but<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.180> only<00:00:45.329> left<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.600> dye<00:00:45.840> on<00:00:46.050> for

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590

probably<00:00:47.480> two<00:00:48.480> minutes<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.050> took<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.320> off

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
probably two minutes and took it off

I just treated myself uh and i think may

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.330
