the<00:00:01.620> perfect

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:06.650 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.100 

the<00:00:07.190> main<00:00:07.340> Achilles<00:00:07.730> heel<00:00:07.910> of<00:00:08.090> the<00:00:08.480> slicing

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.110 
the main Achilles heel of the slicing

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.410 
the main Achilles heel of the slicing
blade<00:00:09.140> is<00:00:09.500> that<00:00:09.680> it's<00:00:10.490> easier<00:00:11.120> to<00:00:11.240> make<00:00:11.389> a

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:11.420 
blade is that it's easier to make a

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.060 
blade is that it's easier to make a
slice<00:00:11.780> but<00:00:12.020> nobody<00:00:12.380> put<00:00:12.559> the<00:00:12.650> thought<00:00:12.830> into

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.070 
slice but nobody put the thought into

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.379 
slice but nobody put the thought into
how<00:00:13.190> to<00:00:13.250> make<00:00:13.400> the<00:00:13.520> product<00:00:13.880> actually<00:00:14.030> any

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389 
how to make the product actually any

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:15.700 
how to make the product actually any
good<00:00:14.480> take<00:00:15.200> a<00:00:15.260> look<00:00:15.380> at<00:00:15.440> some<00:00:15.560> of<00:00:15.650> our

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:15.710 
good take a look at some of our

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.530 
good take a look at some of our
competitors<00:00:16.010> some<00:00:16.550> have<00:00:16.670> many<00:00:16.939> many<00:00:17.150> pieces

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:17.540 
competitors some have many many pieces

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.269 
competitors some have many many pieces
you<00:00:17.630> need<00:00:17.720> to<00:00:17.840> deal<00:00:17.990> with<00:00:18.170> there<00:00:18.439> are<00:00:18.650> really

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:19.279 
you need to deal with there are really

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.450 
you need to deal with there are really
cheap<00:00:20.090> blades<00:00:20.840> some<00:00:21.680> of<00:00:21.770> them<00:00:21.890> inherent<00:00:22.340> in

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
cheap blades some of them inherent in

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.750 
cheap blades some of them inherent in
the<00:00:22.880> nature<00:00:23.000> of<00:00:23.390> the<00:00:23.480> item<00:00:24.289> itself<00:00:24.800> adjusting

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
the nature of the item itself adjusting

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.580 
the nature of the item itself adjusting
the<00:00:25.850> thickness<00:00:26.270> of<00:00:26.449> a<00:00:26.630> slice<00:00:26.869> and<00:00:27.140> a<00:00:27.170> V<00:00:27.320> blade

the thickness of a slice and a V blade

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.590 
the thickness of a slice and a V blade
it's<00:00:27.949> very<00:00:28.130> difficult<00:00:28.490> to<00:00:28.670> do<00:00:28.789> we<00:00:29.000> did<00:00:29.150> several

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:29.600 
it's very difficult to do we did several

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.240 
it's very difficult to do we did several
brainstorming<00:00:30.170> sessions<00:00:30.680> with<00:00:30.830> all<00:00:31.039> of<00:00:31.160> our

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
brainstorming sessions with all of our

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.950 
brainstorming sessions with all of our
engineers<00:00:31.699> and<00:00:31.880> we<00:00:32.239> got<00:00:32.390> a<00:00:32.419> long<00:00:32.629> way<00:00:32.780> down<00:00:32.900> the

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
engineers and we got a long way down the

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.060 
engineers and we got a long way down the
path<00:00:33.260> and<00:00:33.710> and<00:00:35.110> we<00:00:36.110> were<00:00:36.440> faced<00:00:36.650> with<00:00:36.739> actually

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
path and and we were faced with actually

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.620 
path and and we were faced with actually
killing<00:00:37.250> this<00:00:37.430> project<00:00:37.850> this<00:00:38.210> one<00:00:38.390> took<00:00:38.570> me

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:38.630 
killing this project this one took me

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.569 
killing this project this one took me
sitting<00:00:39.290> down<00:00:39.320> for<00:00:39.649> a<00:00:39.680> week<00:00:39.800> at<00:00:39.980> my<00:00:40.100> desk<00:00:40.309> and

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
sitting down for a week at my desk and

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:42.400 
sitting down for a week at my desk and
just<00:00:40.610> sketching<00:00:41.510> out<00:00:41.630> different<00:00:42.050> ways<00:00:42.170> of

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
just sketching out different ways of

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.630 
just sketching out different ways of
coming<00:00:42.710> at<00:00:42.800> the<00:00:42.890> problem<00:00:43.190> until<00:00:43.399> we<00:00:43.489> found

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
coming at the problem until we found

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.190 
coming at the problem until we found
something<00:00:43.790> that<00:00:44.090> was<00:00:44.270> unique<00:00:44.450> I<00:00:44.809> think<00:00:44.930> what

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
something that was unique I think what

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.690 
something that was unique I think what
we<00:00:45.290> came<00:00:45.440> up<00:00:45.590> with<00:00:45.739> superior<00:00:46.370> way<00:00:46.550> of

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
we came up with superior way of

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.090 
we came up with superior way of
adjusting<00:00:47.120> the<00:00:47.149> height<00:00:47.390> that<00:00:48.200> that<00:00:48.530> basically

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
adjusting the height that that basically

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.560 
adjusting the height that that basically
undoes<00:00:49.640> all<00:00:49.850> of<00:00:49.969> the<00:00:50.030> problems<00:00:50.390> of<00:00:50.510> our

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
undoes all of the problems of our

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.270 
undoes all of the problems of our
competitor<00:00:51.020> products<00:00:51.469> so<00:00:51.710> we<00:00:51.829> came<00:00:51.980> up<00:00:52.040> with

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
competitor products so we came up with

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.920 
competitor products so we came up with
basically<00:00:52.520> a<00:00:52.790> double<00:00:53.090> arm<00:00:53.239> mechanism<00:00:53.750> or<00:00:53.870> you

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
basically a double arm mechanism or you

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.260 
basically a double arm mechanism or you
can<00:00:54.079> see<00:00:54.230> that<00:00:54.410> this<00:00:54.530> part<00:00:54.920> here<00:00:55.270> adjust

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
can see that this part here adjust

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.090 
can see that this part here adjust
separately<00:00:56.660> from<00:00:56.780> this<00:00:56.989> runway<00:00:57.440> and<00:00:57.770> on<00:00:58.010> the

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
separately from this runway and on the

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.090 
separately from this runway and on the
underside<00:00:58.280> there<00:00:58.820> is<00:00:59.000> a<00:00:59.030> set<00:00:59.390> of<00:00:59.480> cams<00:01:00.100> that

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
underside there is a set of cams that

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.920 
underside there is a set of cams that
will<00:01:01.219> let<00:01:01.370> them<00:01:01.550> sort<00:01:02.149> of<00:01:02.239> adjust<00:01:02.600> together

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
will let them sort of adjust together

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.329 
will let them sort of adjust together
moving<00:01:03.200> one<00:01:03.500> down<00:01:03.739> while<00:01:03.980> it<00:01:04.070> moves<00:01:04.220> the<00:01:04.309> other

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
moving one down while it moves the other

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.150 
moving one down while it moves the other
up<00:01:04.670> it's<00:01:05.630> to<00:01:06.110> our<00:01:06.140> mechanisms<00:01:06.740> it<00:01:06.830> just<00:01:06.979> keeps

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
up it's to our mechanisms it just keeps

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.800 
up it's to our mechanisms it just keeps
them<00:01:07.280> parallel<00:01:07.640> at<00:01:07.759> all<00:01:07.880> times<00:01:08.119> there's<00:01:08.630> just

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
them parallel at all times there's just

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.809 
them parallel at all times there's just
a<00:01:08.899> lot<00:01:09.020> of<00:01:09.080> nuances<00:01:09.680> to<00:01:09.950> slicing<00:01:10.160> so<00:01:10.520> you<00:01:10.610> sort

00:01:10.809 --> 00:01:10.819 
a lot of nuances to slicing so you sort

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:12.400 
a lot of nuances to slicing so you sort
of<00:01:10.910> basically<00:01:11.240> build<00:01:11.420> an<00:01:11.509> idealized<00:01:11.929> product

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
of basically build an idealized product

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:13.840 
of basically build an idealized product
something<00:01:12.590> that's<00:01:12.830> absolutely<00:01:13.009> perfect<00:01:13.429> not

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
something that's absolutely perfect not

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
we'll start off that and you realize

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:22.690 
we'll start off that and you realize
that<00:01:21.440> your<00:01:21.679> parts<00:01:21.920> are<00:01:22.069> you're<00:01:22.399> too<00:01:22.550> big

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
that your parts are you're too big

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
a handmade prototype that we had the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.550 
a handmade prototype that we had the

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
still affordable to do so after you know

still affordable to do so after you know
you<00:01:37.940> prototype<00:01:38.690> and<00:01:38.869> you<00:01:39.170> finalize<00:01:40.130> design

you prototype and you finalize design

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:41.949 
you prototype and you finalize design
you're<00:01:40.580> sure<00:01:40.670> it's<00:01:40.819> going<00:01:40.940> to<00:01:41.090> work<00:01:41.270> you'll

00:01:41.949 --> 00:01:41.959 
you're sure it's going to work you'll

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:44.400 
you're sure it's going to work you'll
have<00:01:42.229> your<00:01:42.410> molds<00:01:42.679> made<00:01:42.830> I<00:01:43.130> like<00:01:43.759> to<00:01:43.910> have

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
have your molds made I like to have

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.930 
have your molds made I like to have
stuff<00:01:45.410> shot<00:01:45.649> and<00:01:45.920> clear<00:01:46.220> you<00:01:46.429> can<00:01:46.550> see<00:01:46.700> all<00:01:46.819> the

stuff shot and clear you can see all the

stuff shot and clear you can see all the
moving<00:01:47.209> parts<00:01:47.539> you<00:01:47.630> can<00:01:47.869> see<00:01:47.990> how<00:01:48.080> things<00:01:48.380> fit

start to really see see some of the

start to really see see some of the
shortcomings<00:01:53.360> of<00:01:53.630> the<00:01:53.690> design<00:01:54.050> and<00:01:54.289> the
