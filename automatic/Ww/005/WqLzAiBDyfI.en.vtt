00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
complaining about bouncing Betties

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.560 
complaining about bouncing Betties
that's<00:05:29.040> my<00:05:29.220> number<00:05:29.490> one<00:05:29.520> prediction<00:05:30.000> so<00:05:30.330> far

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
that's my number one prediction so far

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.480 
that's my number one prediction so far
and<00:05:30.780> as<00:05:31.260> far<00:05:31.380> as<00:05:31.470> kill<00:05:31.770> streak<00:05:31.980> so<00:05:32.130> this<00:05:32.370> is

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
and as far as kill streak so this is

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:33.740 
and as far as kill streak so this is
where<00:05:32.670> the<00:05:32.760> class<00:05:32.970> gets<00:05:33.240> a<00:05:33.300> little<00:05:33.420> bit<00:05:33.570> more

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
where the class gets a little bit more

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.360 
where the class gets a little bit more
advanced<00:05:34.020> so<00:05:34.290> we<00:05:34.650> have<00:05:34.740> the<00:05:34.830> Osprey<00:05:35.160> gunner

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
advanced so we have the Osprey gunner

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.790 
advanced so we have the Osprey gunner
the<00:05:35.670> ac-130<00:05:36.240> and<00:05:36.480> the<00:05:36.540> UAV<00:05:36.870> all<00:05:37.230> spray<00:05:37.560> gunner

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
the ac-130 and the UAV all spray gunner

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.290 
the ac-130 and the UAV all spray gunner
is<00:05:37.950> basically<00:05:38.280> give<00:05:38.430> me<00:05:38.520> you're<00:05:39.120> gonna<00:05:39.180> be

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
is basically give me you're gonna be

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.820 
is basically give me you're gonna be
able<00:05:39.360> to<00:05:39.570> control<00:05:39.930> a<00:05:39.990> turret<00:05:40.440> I<00:05:40.560> guess<00:05:40.740> you

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
able to control a turret I guess you

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.710 
able to control a turret I guess you
could<00:05:40.860> say<00:05:41.040> in<00:05:41.220> a<00:05:41.550> chopper<00:05:42.030> that<00:05:42.210> drops<00:05:42.480> care

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
could say in a chopper that drops care

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.720 
could say in a chopper that drops care
packages<00:05:43.140> which<00:05:43.290> is<00:05:43.410> pretty<00:05:43.530> badass<00:05:43.830> but<00:05:44.640> we

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:44.730 
packages which is pretty badass but we

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.730 
packages which is pretty badass but we
got<00:05:44.880> to<00:05:44.970> keep<00:05:45.000> in<00:05:45.180> mind<00:05:45.330> is<00:05:45.450> this<00:05:45.540> is<00:05:45.690> a<00:05:45.720> 17<00:05:46.440> kill

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
got to keep in mind is this is a 17 kill

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.380 
got to keep in mind is this is a 17 kill
streak<00:05:47.040> so<00:05:47.280> it's<00:05:47.460> gonna<00:05:47.580> be<00:05:47.670> very<00:05:47.760> hard<00:05:48.120> to<00:05:48.270> get

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.390 
streak so it's gonna be very hard to get

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.210 
streak so it's gonna be very hard to get
