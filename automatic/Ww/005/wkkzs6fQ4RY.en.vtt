really<00:01:14.670> close<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.119> as<00:01:15.210> well<00:01:15.330> this<00:01:15.720> one<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:15.960> a

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
really close to it as well this one is a

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.260 
really close to it as well this one is a
pumpkin<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.590> melon<00:01:16.920> seeds<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.180> know

pumpkin and melon seeds and you know

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.700 
pumpkin and melon seeds and you know
that's<00:01:18.450> awesome<00:01:18.869> stuff<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.080> get<00:01:19.320> right<00:01:19.560> when

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
that's awesome stuff to get right when

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.080 
that's awesome stuff to get right when
you<00:01:19.799> start<00:01:20.159> I<00:01:20.250> mean<00:01:20.400> it's<00:01:20.580> pretty<00:01:20.700> hard<00:01:21.030> to

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090

experience also I notice there's like
building<00:01:25.380> materials<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:25.770> here<00:01:25.860> as<00:01:25.979> well<00:01:26.159> like

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
building materials in here as well like

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.950 
building materials in here as well like
there's<00:01:26.460> three<00:01:26.759> like<00:01:26.939> spruce<00:01:27.299> wood<00:01:27.509> planks

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960

of them but there's lava below which

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.050 
of them but there's lava below which
makes<00:02:25.739> it<00:02:25.920> super<00:02:26.250> dangerous<00:02:26.670> if<00:02:26.790> you<00:02:26.909> don't

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
makes it super dangerous if you don't

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.369 
makes it super dangerous if you don't
die<00:02:27.269> from<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.540> explosion<00:02:27.959> you're<00:02:28.049> gonna<00:02:28.140> die

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
from the lava all right so yeah there's

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.569 
from the lava all right so yeah there's
two<00:02:31.109> right<00:02:31.379> here<00:02:31.650> I<00:02:31.680> mean<00:02:31.920> I'm<00:02:32.250> just<00:02:32.459> gonna
