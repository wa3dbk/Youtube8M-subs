of<00:00:41.390> them<00:00:41.510> i<00:00:41.719> was<00:00:42.649> using<00:00:42.800> it<00:00:43.010> the<00:00:43.190> other<00:00:43.309> day

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
of them i was using it the other day

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.209 
of them i was using it the other day
with<00:00:43.969> leave<00:00:44.390> speed<00:00:44.750> or<00:00:45.019> playstation<00:00:45.710> 2<00:00:45.829> and<00:00:46.039> it

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219

worked pretty well but the thing is

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.110 
worked pretty well but the thing is
force<00:00:49.460> feedback<00:00:49.730> isn't<00:00:50.269> as<00:00:50.600> good<00:00:51.530> as<00:00:51.800> pc<00:00:52.579> when

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
force feedback isn't as good as pc when

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.229 
force feedback isn't as good as pc when
using<00:00:53.829> play<00:00:54.829> session<00:00:55.219> to<00:00:55.370> show<00:00:55.910> the<00:00:56.030> force

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
using play session to show the force

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:57.819 
using play session to show the force

one main port to connect it to the

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.160 
one main port to connect it to the
computer<00:01:24.160> this<00:01:25.420> thing<00:01:26.420> i'm<00:01:26.660> not<00:01:26.810> sure<00:01:26.870> what

you<00:01:27.320> call<00:01:27.620> it<00:01:27.650> to<00:01:28.310> connect<00:01:28.610> it<00:01:28.700> to<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:28.970> pedals

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
you call it to connect it to the pedals

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.120 
you call it to connect it to the pedals
and<00:01:29.690> this<00:01:29.990> thing<00:01:30.260> here<00:01:30.530> which<00:01:30.740> is<00:01:30.920> to<00:01:31.100> the

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
and this thing here which is to the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.640 
and this thing here which is to the
portal<00:01:31.580> feedback<00:01:32.060> so<00:01:32.420> the<00:01:32.540> power<00:01:32.720> powers<00:01:33.470> the

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
portal feedback so the power powers the

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:34.990 
portal feedback so the power powers the
motors<00:01:33.950> and<00:01:34.100> then<00:01:34.190> as<00:01:34.490> you<00:01:34.610> can<00:01:34.670> see<00:01:34.880> it's

have<00:01:42.530> six<00:01:42.800> programmable<00:01:43.370> buttons<00:01:44.380> and<00:01:45.380> two

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
have six programmable buttons and two

computer and ones for force feedback

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.320 
computer and ones for force feedback
yeah<00:01:51.130> so<00:01:52.130> on<00:01:52.460> over<00:01:52.670> here<00:01:52.820> you've<00:01:53.000> got<00:01:53.030> your

yeah so on over here you've got your

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.240 
yeah so on over here you've got your
sequential<00:01:53.660> gear<00:01:53.990> shift<00:01:54.230> now<00:01:54.470> that's<00:01:54.680> just<00:01:54.800> up

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
sequential gear shift now that's just up

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.110 
sequential gear shift now that's just up
and<00:01:55.460> down<00:01:55.670> whatever<00:01:57.040> yeah<00:01:58.040> and<00:01:58.220> on<00:01:58.580> the<00:01:58.760> on<00:01:59.060> the

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
and down whatever yeah and on the on the

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.120 
and down whatever yeah and on the on the
steering<00:01:59.510> shaft<00:01:59.690> sort<00:02:00.530> of<00:02:00.620> thing<00:02:00.800> you<00:02:00.950> have

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
steering shaft sort of thing you have

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.430 
steering shaft sort of thing you have
two<00:02:01.340> paddles<00:02:01.700> and<00:02:02.000> I<00:02:02.330> use<00:02:02.870> them<00:02:03.020> for<00:02:03.200> gear

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
two paddles and I use them for gear

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.800 
two paddles and I use them for gear
shift<00:02:03.770> cuz<00:02:04.340> I<00:02:04.610> think<00:02:04.880> it's<00:02:04.970> a<00:02:05.030> bit<00:02:05.150> easier<00:02:05.180> but

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
shift cuz I think it's a bit easier but

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.830 
shift cuz I think it's a bit easier but

can move it so um yeah and that just

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.130 
can move it so um yeah and that just
goes<00:02:22.170> on<00:02:22.320> if<00:02:22.530> you're<00:02:22.650> not<00:02:22.740> using<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:23.070> side

you have two clamps on the bottom which

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.890 
you have two clamps on the bottom which
are<00:02:28.260> very<00:02:28.670> expandable<00:02:29.670> so<00:02:30.120> they'll<00:02:30.450> fit<00:02:30.720> a

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900

want subscribers early yes we go and we
do<00:02:51.930> have<00:02:52.110> it<00:02:52.320> does<00:02:52.500> have<00:02:52.680> air<00:02:52.920> vents<00:02:53.280> to

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
do have it does have air vents to

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.449 
do have it does have air vents to
circulate<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.540> air<00:02:54.570> through<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:54.959> system<00:02:55.459> so

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
circulate the air through the system so

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:05.720 
circulate the air through the system so
now<00:02:56.820> we'll<00:02:56.970> get<00:02:57.090> our<00:02:57.180> pedals<00:03:00.890> so<00:03:04.490> so<00:03:05.490> here

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
now we'll get our pedals so so here

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.640 
now we'll get our pedals so so here
you've<00:03:05.820> got<00:03:05.850> the<00:03:06.209> pedals<00:03:06.959> got<00:03:07.560> the

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
you've got the pedals got the

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.530 
you've got the pedals got the
accelerator<00:03:08.190> and<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.459> brake<00:03:08.520> now<00:03:09.180> as<00:03:09.360> you<00:03:09.420> can

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
accelerator and the brake now as you can

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.540 
accelerator and the brake now as you can
tell<00:03:09.600> just<00:03:09.810> zoom<00:03:10.080> out<00:03:10.200> a<00:03:10.290> bit<00:03:10.350> so<00:03:11.070> I<00:03:11.100> soon<00:03:11.400> got

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
tell just zoom out a bit so I soon got

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.210 
tell just zoom out a bit so I soon got
the<00:03:11.610> boy<00:03:11.760> but<00:03:12.540> it's<00:03:12.810> actually<00:03:12.959> a<00:03:13.200> really<00:03:13.650> big

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
the boy but it's actually a really big

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.860 
the boy but it's actually a really big
pedal<00:03:14.580> set<00:03:14.910> like<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.209> pedals<00:03:15.540> aren't<00:03:15.750> very

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
pedal set like the pedals aren't very

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.710 
pedal set like the pedals aren't very
big<00:03:16.110> compared<00:03:17.100> to<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.280> actual<00:03:17.720> platform

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
big compared to the actual platform

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.560 
big compared to the actual platform
there<00:03:19.140> on<00:03:19.260> but<00:03:20.190> um<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.940> good<00:03:21.120> thing<00:03:21.330> about<00:03:21.390> it

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
there on but um the good thing about it

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.210 
there on but um the good thing about it
the<00:03:21.840> more<00:03:21.989> realistic<00:03:22.500> thing<00:03:22.709> is<00:03:22.890> the

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
the more realistic thing is the

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.220 
the more realistic thing is the
accelerator<00:03:23.880> is<00:03:24.120> easy<00:03:24.360> to<00:03:24.600> push<00:03:24.870> and<00:03:25.200> the

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
accelerator is easy to push and the

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.930 
accelerator is easy to push and the
break<00:03:25.560> is<00:03:25.709> harder<00:03:26.010> to<00:03:26.040> push<00:03:26.340> this<00:03:26.580> is<00:03:26.730> a<00:03:26.760> break

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
break is harder to push this is a break

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.699 
break is harder to push this is a break
also<00:03:27.300> gets<00:03:27.510> harder<00:03:27.840> push<00:03:27.989> to<00:03:28.140> further<00:03:28.320> push<00:03:28.590> it

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
also gets harder push to further push it

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.350 
also gets harder push to further push it
down<00:03:28.830> to<00:03:29.070> see<00:03:29.370> that's<00:03:29.580> easy<00:03:29.820> easy<00:03:30.180> easy

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
down to see that's easy easy easy

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.729 
down to see that's easy easy easy
getting<00:03:30.870> part<00:03:31.050> of<00:03:31.140> getting<00:03:31.260> part<00:03:31.470> of<00:03:31.560> giving

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
getting part of getting part of giving

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.190 
getting part of getting part of giving
rise<00:03:31.830> so<00:03:32.070> it<00:03:32.280> is<00:03:32.489> life<00:03:32.940> like<00:03:33.120> sort<00:03:33.780> of<00:03:33.810> braking

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
rise so it is life like sort of braking

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.920 
rise so it is life like sort of braking
system<00:03:34.560> and<00:03:34.769> on<00:03:35.670> the<00:03:35.820> butt<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:36.209> you<00:03:36.450> have<00:03:36.600> done
