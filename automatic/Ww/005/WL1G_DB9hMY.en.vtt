00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.830
 My motto I'm yours again 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.570
 joshua from be part gaming and today 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.329
 you are very welcome 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.230
 to a new episode let's play fifa 14 

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:21.480
 ultimate team 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.210
 You see , I have teams again 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.779
 built and restructured and everything around it 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.239
 and turn 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.919
 As I said, I was so often 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:31.019
 not every team in the script 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:32.850
 That's why you have pictures 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.390
 Here the possibility to stop again 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.829
 move 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.449
 to go back and through the team 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.920
 to look closer if you do not care 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:39.629
 is just looking at you now or 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.280
 well now just so it goes 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.980
 Of course, yes, I have really good ones 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.210
 whimsy is just 20 39 actually am 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.160
 I have such a phase from the 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.199
 training I'm already tired 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.120
 I'll lie down in bed but I have 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:53.399
 me I do believe me knows this 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.739
 I have simple pickup videos 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.710
 fed on youtube and yes I have 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.379
 such a German-German seen the 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.179
 has brought the 100 dumbest claims 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.310
 to women and it even has sometimes 

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:07.650
 worked and they were sometimes so stupid 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:10.230
 So I seldom seldom laugh 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.180
 very loud in my room but there 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.630
 I did not have to start right 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.420
 laugh 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.190
 I just want that 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.440
 just say for a moment why I'm in 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.450
 Lately not so much video 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.430
 content, yes I think that 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.870
 some noticed there is often in 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.230
 the comments I'm busy yes 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.850
 With 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.380
 and that's not because of me 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.210
 Do not be bothered to make videos 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.010
 On the contrary, I am somehow right on 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.200
 fire somehow here rauszuhauen something 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.750
 but it's because I actually 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.720
 gone by with a joke yes the game makes 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.970
 frankly to me now are not so 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.610
 That's why I enjoy it all the more 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.710
 when the nextgen consoles come out 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.600
 because then you have so new incentive again 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.040
 to play it all and there is also 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.990
 again this aha effect aha that 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.660
 I do not know yet this is new that is 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.140
 cool and I have fifa 14 at the expo 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.120
 already played gamescom and there 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.040
 it just blew me away it was like that 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.900
 what a blatant and I'm just happy 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.360
 be so keen on it and then you too 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.730
 again real videos like on the production line 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.960
 Coming punches must be fun 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.040
 aside 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.450
 then will definitely be back 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.280
 neatly escaped as I said 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.710
 At the moment you do not go that far now 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.160
 do you like some of course sarah sandman you 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:25.770
 you're talking about over 200 games 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.330
 or something in a sketch yes at the beginning 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.030
 I'm pretty much looking for the game 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.980
 before the updates there was the game 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.780
 unbelievable but it's meanwhile 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.210
 two updates came out after that 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.160
 first ball already a bit disappointed because 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.040
 The game was really good for me 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.450
 and then it was changed again 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.610
 then I said okay 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.710
 take it but fun again 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.070
 then came the second update as the 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.660
 fitness shots and the headballs in 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.010
 special page patch was also though 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.410
 this is just me that fits me 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.390
 here head out high to what I 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.880
 say but as said it was biting 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.700
 patched and yes says game is somehow 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.950
 the feeling the game is more open again 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.360
 Pace designed there it does not come too 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.850
 Immediately, for example, such players 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.130
 muriel or other players that are 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.320
 just again so over powered 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.080
 Such a beast any previously they were 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.160
 just not because other stuff he's in 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.660
 foreground 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.060
 write your opinion in the 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.220
 comments and if you think that's a pity 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.140
 to is and so if it is natural 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.840
 I see it myself, too 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.090
 fall very bad because that was that 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.340
 thing in fifa 13 ultimate too 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.380
 was criticized that pace is everything 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.910
 and that's what the developers wanted to think 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.340
 You also have to change them first 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.460
 but now they are like 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.200
 drug addicts stop relapsing 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.420
 and of course that does not matter that much 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.950
 fun except the people of course like the 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.960
 For example, I play with pace 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:54.090
 the example of a buddy of mine is 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.170
 a person in german said that excites 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.030
 I always like that when I am 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.890
 then we see that with muriel and the 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.480
 Bar Bono plays in front instead of himself 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.490
 such horny players as balotelli or 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.450
 also mario gomez in his series 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.550
 to take a breath 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.830
 no he needs the fast and at 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.750
 he sometimes even works that way 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.520
 We'll do it the way it is 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.410
 Watch and then come flank of the 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.360
 rhine and muriel head in or the 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.580
 bar where I put so blatant with 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.930
 his 93 ps or something like that , I have to 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:22.109
 of course also smile inside 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.640
 Let's laugh but honestly 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.130
 I think it's a bit unfair, too 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.810
 for the opponent times that if you 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.190
 the team has that experience through case 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.080
 I'm so beaten now 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.500
 a bit focused on pace say 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.750
 me once 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.880
 the game in the first half nothing 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.250
 happened and now you have these 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.750
 this was amazing and seen 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.130
 after this pass look here 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.900
 again from the members 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.660
 that may not have been planned 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.200
 After this pass I was really down saying 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.730
 me once 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.820
 because I have a good one before that 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.500
 had chance and yes then yes 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.370
 really just like nothing at all 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.840
 remember that makes 2 0 and that was it 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.170
 then I have already eaten a game 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.700
 times 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.370
 I think everyone knows this one 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.590
 point in the game he knows that 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.660
 Just play is over then comes 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.030
 such a ship ines and then 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.260
 dusted again from the gate cuadrado the 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.720
 is also a player of me by the way 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.130
 really excited just because he is like that too 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.690
 is fast and because he is 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.690
 Strangely, shoot quite well 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.340
 Can also be if you have his cards 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.980
 can not accept it now 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.050
 especially because of that, I'll go with you 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.400
 not just because it somehow 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.080
 I've got how this changed 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.130
 Under my dignity would be with such 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.320
 to play players 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.030
 yes, I could not do that myself 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.590
 heart bring with me the players 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.080
 yourself upset by the pace or 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.210
 By some shit, I'll say yes 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.070
 I do not play that then 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:44.250
 that's it already successes this off 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.750
 comments are from now on I am only 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:56.190
 let's see you next time 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:58.080
 video until then your sandman hd very 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:01.550
 We keep it quiet for a very long time 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:05.440
 thought comes you must me vorsetzt 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.440
 no half bread from the bakery
