00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
this one Coast just using their

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.600 
this one Coast just using their
advantage<00:05:02.230> here<00:05:02.350> to<00:05:02.470> pressure<00:05:02.740> down<00:05:03.040> that

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
much more as we were saying they're

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.290

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
game tomorrow and they look very very

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.510 
game tomorrow and they look very very
close<00:05:11.290> skill<00:05:11.740> but<00:05:11.890> from<00:05:12.070> a<00:05:12.160> mentality

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
close skill but from a mentality

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.820 
close skill but from a mentality
perspective<00:05:13.330> ghost<00:05:14.020> is<00:05:14.170> the<00:05:14.290> team<00:05:14.470> coming<00:05:14.680> off

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
perspective ghost is the team coming off

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.920 
perspective ghost is the team coming off
a<00:05:14.890> win<00:05:15.070> fusion<00:05:15.580> at<00:05:15.640> the<00:05:15.760> team<00:05:15.940> coming<00:05:16.720> off<00:05:16.870> a

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
a win fusion at the team coming off a

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.300 
a win fusion at the team coming off a
loss<00:05:17.020> and<00:05:17.470> I<00:05:17.530> think<00:05:17.770> that<00:05:17.890> actually<00:05:18.190> gives

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
loss and I think that actually gives

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:19.950 
loss and I think that actually gives
Coast<00:05:18.610> a<00:05:18.760> little<00:05:19.090> bit<00:05:19.180> of<00:05:19.210> a<00:05:19.300> grow<00:05:19.570> either<00:05:19.780> of

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
Coast a little bit of a grow either of

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.680 
Coast a little bit of a grow either of
these<00:05:20.050> teams<00:05:20.260> have<00:05:20.410> faced<00:05:20.830> each<00:05:21.040> other<00:05:21.190> and

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
these teams have faced each other and

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.930 
these teams have faced each other and
Coast<00:05:22.690> has<00:05:22.960> the<00:05:23.430> confidence<00:05:24.430> of<00:05:24.700> being<00:05:24.850> like

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
Coast has the confidence of being like

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.490 
Coast has the confidence of being like
oh<00:05:25.030> yeah<00:05:25.150> the<00:05:25.270> only<00:05:25.480> team<00:05:25.660> we<00:05:25.750> lost<00:05:25.780> to<00:05:26.140> was<00:05:26.380> the

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
oh yeah the only team we lost to was the

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.260 
oh yeah the only team we lost to was the
team<00:05:26.710> with<00:05:26.860> just<00:05:27.010> one<00:05:27.220> straight<00:05:27.550> out<00:05:27.700> right<00:05:28.090> we

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
team with just one straight out right we

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.490 
team with just one straight out right we
destroyed<00:05:28.750> fusion<00:05:29.230> by<00:05:29.530> the<00:05:29.590> way<00:05:31.230> could<00:05:32.230> be<00:05:32.290> a

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
destroyed fusion by the way could be a

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.430 
destroyed fusion by the way could be a
very<00:05:32.830> interesting<00:05:33.400> matchup<00:05:34.140> see<00:05:35.140> what<00:05:35.350> the

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
very interesting matchup see what the

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.170 
very interesting matchup see what the
champion<00:05:35.890> pools<00:05:36.130> are<00:05:36.340> shared<00:05:36.610> between<00:05:36.730> those
