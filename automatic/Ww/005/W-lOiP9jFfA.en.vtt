let's consider what needs to happen here
in<00:01:59.030> order<00:01:59.360> for<00:01:59.630> there<00:01:59.750> to<00:01:59.810> be<00:02:00.020> a<00:02:00.140> smooth

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
in order for there to be a smooth

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
boom there in the next drive is where i

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.170

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
a good job shifting his way back he

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.130 
a good job shifting his way back he
tends<00:05:14.670> to<00:05:14.850> lose<00:05:15.090> a<00:05:15.360> little<00:05:15.510> forward<00:05:15.900> momentum

across the board we determine where that

right shape point needs to be and what I
