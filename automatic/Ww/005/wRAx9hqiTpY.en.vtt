00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.710
 but 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.340
 conveniently 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:23.000
 Hello my name is denis shevchenko 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:25.519
 and today we 'll figure it out 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.050
 rock and roll style accompaniment what we 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.849
 Now we will deal with you and you 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.939
 can hear the songs 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.540
 TCB Johnny B Goode we'll have 12 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:34.600
 cycles 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.760
 we will play in the tonality of B-flat 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.010
 by structure it looks like blues 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.190
 square that is the first four bars is 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.059
 tonic and then two clocks of subdominant 52 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.360
 so tonic 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:49.399
 two cycles dominant that is, we are not 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.010
 move on to the fourth stage 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:55.489
 as often happens in blues music and 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.650
 and actually so tonic and dominator and 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.629
 let's see how we do it 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.809
 playing the guitar will also break it down with you 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:05.810
 reef it will be the same for all chords 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:08.479
 and for tunic for tire dominant for 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.150
 dominoes what we do here we do 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.259
 set remind we are in 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.090
 the key of B flat 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:18.650
 index fingers we put our 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:24.469
 It cost 6 strings and a third finger for 8 frets 5 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:25.819
 the string is played here twice 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:33.289
 we strings at the bridge 

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:38.780
 With a brush, then we put Myazinets on 10 lats 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:40.810
 5 strings and it makes up the floor so then 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.810
 us 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.869
 that is, pay attention we are playing not 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:59.539
 we play cleaning mezen 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:05.899
 and repeat again in the second floor 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:06.939
 clocks need to add that we accentuate 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:16.840
 second share 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:16.840
 4 share what you get 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.420
 it was four tactics tonics 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.230
 now two tacts subdominant is with us 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.790

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:37.000

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.880
 fret 4 strings 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.549
 Do not forget to turn off the right hand of the country 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:59.549
 that is how it sounds 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:11.769
 yes here we have to play pretty 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:14.799

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:32.109
