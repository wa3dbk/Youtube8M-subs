00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
later today without winning a game do

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.620 
later today without winning a game do
you<00:01:04.920> think<00:01:05.159> this<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.360> game<00:01:06.600> that

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
you think this this is the game that

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.260 
you think this this is the game that
would<00:01:06.990> do<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.110> for<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.799> guess<00:01:08.729> if<00:01:08.909> they<00:01:09.030> see

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
would do it for you I guess if they see

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.630 
would do it for you I guess if they see
it<00:01:09.390> as<00:01:09.570> we<00:01:09.960> lost<00:01:10.200> about<00:01:10.680> two<00:01:10.950> points<00:01:11.340> other

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
it as we lost about two points other

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.429 
it as we lost about two points other
than<00:01:11.790> losing<00:01:12.210> by<00:01:12.330> 30<00:01:12.600> like<00:01:12.780> we<00:01:12.869> did<00:01:13.020> last<00:01:13.049> time

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
than losing by 30 like we did last time

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.499 
than losing by 30 like we did last time
or<00:01:14.070> they<00:01:14.369> can<00:01:14.549> say<00:01:14.729> well<00:01:14.939> they're<00:01:15.119> good<00:01:15.299> thing

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
or they can say well they're good thing

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.440 
or they can say well they're good thing
better<00:01:15.720> than<00:01:15.900> they<00:01:16.049> were<00:01:16.080> before<00:01:17.090> I<00:01:18.090> mean<00:01:18.390> I

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
better than they were before I mean I

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.719 
better than they were before I mean I
hope<00:01:18.570> we<00:01:18.780> got<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.229> chance<00:01:19.439> now<00:01:19.700> definitely<00:01:20.700> i

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
hope we got a chance now definitely i

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.640
