 Have you ever been with her like Nadia ? 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:15.969
 Her like Nadia 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:17.870
 That's it Anno Hideaki that cheap of people and concern has been going out with creators 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:22.120
 What 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.120
 After all, I feel like the Asian turn 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:31.220
 Uw u u 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:33.760
 What does it mean? It's ugly and attractive even if you bother the man by saying selfishness 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.760
 It is a meaning 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:43.329
 But if you're a producer, isn't it all right? 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:45.930
 I say something as it is, but I am attracted to people with overwhelming talent or something 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.160
 I think it is the same because there is a way like that 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.720
 Such 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:58.470
 It probably went name was going out with her I'm selfish 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:01:00.850
 Well, because my own selfishness is overwhelmed 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.820
 Well then 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:07.120
 Girl's selfishness etc 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:12.760
 I can only hear the words of oysters 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:15.380
 It intends Uhauha is from body from either ignore or not to head 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:19.280
 It is big care 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:22.780
 Haga original is not a clash hit each other and also 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:27.050
 It's because you are in the same dimension as the other party . 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:32.390
 The wind that there not? Do I need to hear also selfish of something girl 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:36.230
 If I say such selfishness and I don't like it I think so much as I think I should break up 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:40.700
 I hope it is a girl who Tsukiaeru I say it like that I think I'm selfish 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:44.890
 Not have the stomach, such as Tsukiaeru in er softening doing such a thing when saying'll no longer have 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:49.659
 Once it was about made also about Tteyuu good to not say something I girl 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:53.320

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.630
