awful<00:01:48.000> lot<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.360> time<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.840> seed<00:01:49.049> Cup<00:01:49.320> she's

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
awful lot of time that seed Cup she's

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.440 
awful lot of time that seed Cup she's
chosen<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.250> seed<00:01:50.430> Cup<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.820> study<00:01:51.060> your<00:01:51.210> nest

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
chosen the seed Cup and study your nest

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.810 
chosen the seed Cup and study your nest
and<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.290> don't<00:01:52.799> want<00:01:53.040> her<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.340> start<00:01:53.610> laying

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
and you don't want her to start laying

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.800 
and you don't want her to start laying
there<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:54.360> what<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.720> need<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.049> do<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:56.570> take<00:01:57.570> out

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
there so what you need to do is take out

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.600 
there so what you need to do is take out
that<00:01:57.990> seed<00:01:58.290> Cup

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
that seed Cup

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.720 
that seed Cup
and<00:01:59.700> put<00:02:00.660> your<00:02:00.930> nest<00:02:01.260> where<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.950> C<00:02:02.160> cup<00:02:02.430> was

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
and put your nest where the C cup was

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.970 
and put your nest where the C cup was
because<00:02:03.210> once<00:02:03.450> she's<00:02:03.660> chosen<00:02:04.080> that<00:02:04.170> location

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
because once she's chosen that location

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.670 
because once she's chosen that location
I<00:02:05.010> really<00:02:06.000> think<00:02:06.150> uh<00:02:06.390> hands<00:02:07.050> imprints<00:02:07.590> on

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
I really think uh hands imprints on

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.889 
I really think uh hands imprints on
location<00:02:08.220> if<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.790> watch<00:02:09.210> them<00:02:09.570> when<00:02:09.780> they

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
location if you watch them when they

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.290 
location if you watch them when they
choose<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.229> nest<00:02:10.590> they<00:02:11.550> will<00:02:11.790> jump<00:02:12.090> back<00:02:12.150> a

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
choose a nest they will jump back a

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.670 
choose a nest they will jump back a
forth<00:02:12.600> back<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:12.780> forth<00:02:12.900> back<00:02:13.050> and<00:02:13.200> forth<00:02:13.380> like

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
forth back and forth back and forth like

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.930 
forth back and forth back and forth like
a<00:02:13.860> thousand<00:02:14.340> times

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
a thousand times

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.080 
a thousand times
before<00:02:15.930> they<00:02:16.080> settle<00:02:16.350> into<00:02:16.650> that<00:02:16.680> nest<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.490> I

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
before they settle into that nest and I

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.120 
before they settle into that nest and I
really<00:02:18.540> think<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:19.050> they're<00:02:19.410> imprinting<00:02:19.890> on

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
really think that they're imprinting on

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.480 
really think that they're imprinting on
the<00:02:20.280> location<00:02:21.030> that<00:02:21.240> they've<00:02:21.600> chosen<00:02:22.010> so<00:02:23.010> good

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
the location that they've chosen so good

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.040 
the location that they've chosen so good
luck<00:02:23.730> changing<00:02:24.180> their<00:02:24.330> location<00:02:24.870> I<00:02:25.020> mean

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
luck changing their location I mean

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.600 
luck changing their location I mean
they're<00:02:25.350> imprinting<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:25.950> in<00:02:26.100> their<00:02:26.310> little

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
they're imprinting it in their little

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.950 
they're imprinting it in their little
mind<00:02:26.820> that<00:02:27.000> that's<00:02:27.180> where<00:02:27.420> they<00:02:27.540> want<00:02:27.750> their

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
mind that that's where they want their

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.980 
mind that that's where they want their
nest<00:02:28.310> so<00:02:29.310> it's<00:02:29.490> just<00:02:29.640> easier<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.360> take<00:02:30.570> out

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
nest so it's just easier to take out

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.870 
nest so it's just easier to take out
whatever<00:02:31.350> is<00:02:31.830> there<00:02:32.100> that<00:02:32.400> she's<00:02:32.550> trying<00:02:32.760> to

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
whatever is there that she's trying to

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.270 
whatever is there that she's trying to
nest<00:02:33.060> in<00:02:33.240> and<00:02:33.720> put<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.020> nest<00:02:34.230> pan<00:02:34.470> in<00:02:35.010> that

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
nest in and put the nest pan in that

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.590 
nest in and put the nest pan in that
location<00:02:35.640> that<00:02:35.820> she's<00:02:36.120> chosen

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
location that she's chosen

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.449 
location that she's chosen
she's<00:02:37.020> already<00:02:37.230> imprinted<00:02:37.680> on<00:02:37.920> it<00:02:37.950> so<00:02:38.280> guess

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
she's already imprinted on it so guess

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.310 
she's already imprinted on it so guess
what<00:02:38.700> this<00:02:39.180> makes<00:02:39.510> it<00:02:39.690> easier<00:02:39.959> for<00:02:39.990> you

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
what this makes it easier for you

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.160 
what this makes it easier for you
because<00:02:41.040> now<00:02:41.220> she's<00:02:41.490> going<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:41.970> choose<00:02:42.660> your

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
because now she's going to choose your

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.720 
because now she's going to choose your
nest<00:02:43.440> pan<00:02:43.680> because<00:02:43.890> it's<00:02:44.160> in<00:02:44.280> that<00:02:44.400> correct

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
nest pan because it's in that correct

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.150 
nest pan because it's in that correct
location<00:02:45.300> that<00:02:45.480> she's<00:02:45.660> imprinted<00:02:46.290> on<00:02:46.410> so

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
location that she's imprinted on so

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.850 
location that she's imprinted on so
there's<00:02:47.430> a<00:02:47.490> one<00:02:47.700> up<00:02:47.850> for<00:02:48.060> you<00:02:48.440> um

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
there's a one up for you um

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.449 
there's a one up for you um
if<00:02:49.980> your<00:02:50.220> head<00:02:50.610> is<00:02:50.970> laying<00:02:51.959> eggs<00:02:52.410> off<00:02:52.800> the

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
if your head is laying eggs off the

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.270 
if your head is laying eggs off the
perch<00:02:54.200> sometimes<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.350> can<00:02:55.500> take<00:02:55.650> all<00:02:55.920> the

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
perch sometimes you can take all the

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.890 
perch sometimes you can take all the
perches<00:02:56.670> out<00:02:56.820> and<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:57.330> can<00:02:57.450> put<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.690> seed

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
perches out and you can put the seed

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.980 
perches out and you can put the seed
cups<00:02:58.170> as<00:02:59.040> low<00:02:59.640> as<00:02:59.940> possible<00:03:00.060> in<00:03:00.600> the<00:03:00.750> cage<00:03:00.959> like

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
cups as low as possible in the cage like

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.410 
cups as low as possible in the cage like
see<00:03:01.740> how<00:03:01.830> that<00:03:02.010> purple<00:03:02.400> one<00:03:02.430> is<00:03:02.760> at<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.060> very

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
see how that purple one is at the very

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.360 
see how that purple one is at the very
bottom<00:03:03.690> there<00:03:04.200> that's<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:04.980> way<00:03:05.070> you'd<00:03:05.220> want

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
bottom there that's the way you'd want

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.190 
bottom there that's the way you'd want
all<00:03:05.610> your<00:03:05.820> seed<00:03:06.030> cups<00:03:06.300> and<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:06.600> same<00:03:06.810> thing<00:03:07.050> if

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
all your seed cups and the same thing if

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.440 
all your seed cups and the same thing if
she's<00:03:07.500> chosen<00:03:07.860> to<00:03:08.220> nest<00:03:08.489> in<00:03:08.670> C<00:03:08.850> cup<00:03:09.060> she<00:03:09.239> put

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
she's chosen to nest in C cup she put

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.720 
she's chosen to nest in C cup she put
those<00:03:09.709> cups<00:03:10.709> at<00:03:10.860> the<00:03:10.950> very<00:03:11.190> bottom<00:03:11.370> of<00:03:11.670> the

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
those cups at the very bottom of the

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.160 
those cups at the very bottom of the
cage<00:03:11.940> because<00:03:12.390> then<00:03:12.600> they're<00:03:12.840> really

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
cage because then they're really

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.740 
cage because then they're really
undesirable<00:03:13.950> a<00:03:14.160> head<00:03:14.340> does<00:03:14.519> not<00:03:14.700> want<00:03:14.910> to<00:03:15.420> make

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
undesirable a head does not want to make

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.229 
undesirable a head does not want to make
a<00:03:16.019> nest<00:03:16.590> somewhere<00:03:17.400> really<00:03:17.820> low

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
a nest somewhere really low

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.259 
a nest somewhere really low
she<00:03:18.420> wants<00:03:18.750> her<00:03:19.110> eggs<00:03:19.890> up<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:20.640> protected

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
she wants her eggs up and protected

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:22.940 
she wants her eggs up and protected
that's<00:03:21.510> nature's<00:03:22.110> way<00:03:22.290> to<00:03:22.350> tell<00:03:22.620> her<00:03:22.709> to<00:03:22.830> do

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
that's nature's way to tell her to do

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.080 
that's nature's way to tell her to do
that<00:03:24.050> so<00:03:25.050> if<00:03:25.410> your<00:03:25.709> head<00:03:25.920> is<00:03:25.950> laying<00:03:26.580> eggs<00:03:26.850> off

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
that so if your head is laying eggs off

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.360 
that so if your head is laying eggs off
the<00:03:27.269> perch<00:03:27.480> take<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:27.989> perches<00:03:28.380> out<00:03:28.530> take<00:03:29.250> the

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
the perch take the perches out take the

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.740 
the perch take the perches out take the
seed<00:03:29.580> cups<00:03:29.820> put<00:03:30.060> them<00:03:30.180> at<00:03:30.269> the<00:03:30.360> very<00:03:30.390> bottom

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
seed cups put them at the very bottom

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.479 
seed cups put them at the very bottom
then<00:03:31.620> your<00:03:31.800> nest<00:03:31.980> there's<00:03:32.160> gonna<00:03:32.250> be<00:03:32.400> the

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
then your nest there's gonna be the

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.750 
then your nest there's gonna be the
highest<00:03:32.700> location<00:03:33.480> in<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:34.620> cage<00:03:35.459> and

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
highest location in the cage and

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.940 
highest location in the cage and
hopefully<00:03:36.330> she<00:03:36.780> will<00:03:36.989> just<00:03:37.440> start<00:03:37.620> laying<00:03:37.800> her

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
hopefully she will just start laying her

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.910 
hopefully she will just start laying her
eggs<00:03:37.980> in<00:03:38.280> there<00:03:38.900> some<00:03:39.900> hens<00:03:40.170> are<00:03:40.410> not<00:03:40.560> gonna<00:03:40.709> do

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
eggs in there some hens are not gonna do

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.199 
eggs in there some hens are not gonna do
it<00:03:41.040> no<00:03:41.190> matter<00:03:41.220> what<00:03:41.459> they're<00:03:41.910> just<00:03:42.120> gonna

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
it no matter what they're just gonna

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:43.910 
it no matter what they're just gonna
start<00:03:42.480> laying<00:03:42.690> their<00:03:42.840> eggs<00:03:42.930> everywhere<00:03:43.440> and

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
start laying their eggs everywhere and

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.640 
start laying their eggs everywhere and
these<00:03:44.430> hands<00:03:44.910> personally<00:03:45.780> for<00:03:45.930> me<00:03:46.080> I<00:03:46.110> sell

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
these hands personally for me I sell

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.290 
these hands personally for me I sell
them<00:03:46.860> I<00:03:47.040> don't<00:03:47.100> think<00:03:47.310> it's<00:03:47.640> worth<00:03:48.000> keeping

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
them I don't think it's worth keeping

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.630 
them I don't think it's worth keeping
them<00:03:48.630> in<00:03:48.750> your<00:03:48.780> breeding<00:03:49.200> program<00:03:49.620> these<00:03:50.459> are

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
them in your breeding program these are

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.720 
them in your breeding program these are
pens<00:03:50.880> that<00:03:51.000> are<00:03:51.680> you<00:03:52.680> know<00:03:52.769> possibly<00:03:53.250> passing

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
pens that are you know possibly passing

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.490 
pens that are you know possibly passing
down<00:03:53.880> that<00:03:54.060> trait<00:03:54.300> to<00:03:54.450> their<00:03:54.600> babies<00:03:54.959> so<00:03:55.260> I

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
down that trait to their babies so I

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.259 
down that trait to their babies so I
mean<00:03:55.980> you<00:03:56.070> could<00:03:56.250> pick<00:03:56.400> up<00:03:56.549> those<00:03:56.700> eggs<00:03:57.030> and

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
mean you could pick up those eggs and

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:58.880 
mean you could pick up those eggs and
you<00:03:57.390> can<00:03:57.570> foster<00:03:57.750> them<00:03:58.110> under<00:03:58.290> other<00:03:58.440> hens<00:03:58.739> and

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
you can foster them under other hens and

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.500 
you can foster them under other hens and
you<00:03:58.980> can<00:03:59.130> hope<00:03:59.340> that<00:03:59.370> their<00:03:59.700> babies<00:04:00.030> don't<00:04:00.180> do

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
you can hope that their babies don't do

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.180 
you can hope that their babies don't do
the<00:04:00.690> same<00:04:00.870> thing<00:04:01.170> but<00:04:01.470> you're<00:04:01.739> taking<00:04:01.920> a

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
the same thing but you're taking a

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.340 
the same thing but you're taking a
chance<00:04:02.220> and<00:04:02.820> the<00:04:03.360> way<00:04:03.480> I<00:04:03.510> look<00:04:03.720> at<00:04:03.840> my<00:04:03.959> breeding

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
chance and the way I look at my breeding

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.140 
chance and the way I look at my breeding
program<00:04:04.680> is<00:04:04.860> I<00:04:05.070> want<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:05.370> best<00:04:05.519> breeders<00:04:06.000> in

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
program is I want the best breeders in

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.960 
program is I want the best breeders in
it<00:04:06.299> and<00:04:06.540> I<00:04:07.049> want<00:04:07.320> to<00:04:07.680> get<00:04:08.040> rid<00:04:08.220> of<00:04:08.280> those<00:04:08.550> traits

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
it and I want to get rid of those traits

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.760 
it and I want to get rid of those traits
that<00:04:09.209> I<00:04:09.300> don't<00:04:09.660> like<00:04:09.900> you<00:04:10.290> know<00:04:10.440> and<00:04:10.650> that's

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
that I don't like you know and that's

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.000 
that I don't like you know and that's
one<00:04:11.040> trait<00:04:11.310> I<00:04:11.340> don't<00:04:11.610> like

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
one trait I don't like

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.460 
one trait I don't like
so<00:04:12.159> the<00:04:12.879> hens<00:04:13.090> that<00:04:13.330> are<00:04:13.390> doing<00:04:13.599> that<00:04:13.870> half<00:04:14.290> the

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
so the hens that are doing that half the

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.539 
so the hens that are doing that half the
goal<00:04:14.790> so<00:04:15.790> hopefully<00:04:16.269> if<00:04:16.510> you<00:04:17.100> you<00:04:18.100> know<00:04:18.190> stick

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
goal so hopefully if you you know stick

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.430 
goal so hopefully if you you know stick

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.980 
trait gets higher and that you will be
more<00:04:27.669> successful<00:04:28.060> in<00:04:28.300> your<00:04:28.330> breeding<00:04:28.570> program

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
more successful in your breeding program

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.919 
more successful in your breeding program
so<00:04:29.500> good<00:04:29.740> luck
