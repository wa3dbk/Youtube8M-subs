00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.000
 hello and welcome to the ballet channel with 

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:07.550
 technique today I will show you how to place 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.940
 your ribbons springs and protectors to your 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:13.929
 tips ok this is our tip now 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.489
 It comes with a spring included and is adjusted 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:19.130
 we have these tapes on this side that 

00:00:16.489 --> 00:00:20.779
 choked included equally and these 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.529
 they are very good they come very long they are very 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.419
 good quality 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.939
 we also have restored some ribbons 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:27.380
 conventional 12 is bright and the 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.779
 another not precisely so that 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.270
 slide our bathrooms, I like them 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:35.330
 a lot because they cause you tendonitis and not 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.430
 let your foot move and you are 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.770
 angular 2 there is no possibility the 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.990
 very good elasticity we will place our 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.480
 tip in this way to place the 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.040
 We will draw two lines back 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.560
 forward and back and forth 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.630
 it's a little diagonal on this 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.390
 diagonal we will place our ribbons 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:57.050
 we'll make a hem inside and we'll do 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.950
 a square and a cross sewn with 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.829
 thread and needle 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:03.350
 after that on the line we're going to 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.149
 place our tapes the tapes should 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.270
 of being in the opposite of where 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:09.840
 they separate one 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.939
 in this way so that they can 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.000
 vote very well on the foot because 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.710
 just if you have a lot of catching you 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.259
 it will stop better and will prevent 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.689
 your point is skipped well here we have two 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.789
 types of spring one thick and in what 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.469
 the draft is open, I recommend it more 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.810
 for girls who do not have much 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:29.880
 pawn and gore I only recommend for 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.759
 guys who have a lot of instep and apart 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.799
 it's very durable well now I'm going to 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.679
 comment something about the springs 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.630
 placed in the form of a bracelet also the 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:41.459
 Truly the loose are not me 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.020
 they like you very much because they do not strengthen you in 

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:45.080
 nothing the achilles tendon and apart from 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.780
 the shoes are coming out 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.480
 traffic recommends putting springs in 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.820
 cross way these concerts help 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.520
 a lot for the girls who have a lot 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.010
 We will put this effort in this way 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.770
 where is this seam we will place this 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:03.080
 spring on one side and we will cross it and 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.080
 then equally of the other we will place it 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.030
 and we will cross it 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.540
 once placed our spring is 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.610
 you will see this way very well now for 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.800
 sewing our tips is special a 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.470
 cotton thread that comes very thick and 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.350
 it attracts its needles those needles are in 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.400
 Curve shape or one waiting for you 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.600
 you can use the flat needle for 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.210
 Sew it up your eyes since the 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.880
 thicker leaf springs and curve 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.530
 for your tapes works very well now 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.690
 I know that the points are very slippery 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.510
 can choose to upload a small 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.880
 stitches around the tip or put 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.280
 some things that are leather with leather 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.830
 they seem languages ​​to place them with resistol 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.510
 5000 or send them with a cobbler this 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.890
 will make your tip last longer and for 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.290
 Of course you will not slip 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.360
 It is also important to consider what 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.000
 size is going to place the spring to 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.280
 the tip we will place the tip of the 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.840
 vagina to measure luck too 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.120
 we have to take into account the 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.410
 stitching since we do not want that we do not 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.870
 It is very tight and very water 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.520
 remember that we previously found 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.250
 a posture in the back where 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.110
 we put the first springs very well 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.030
 in the middle of our shoe 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.070
 you also find another seam in 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.280
 this side of the seam we will place the 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.990
 another end of our spring too 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.630
 you have to be very careful not to sew 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.430
 above the ribbons the spring all 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.380
 you have to have your space because if in 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.020
 some time we want to use this 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.030
 we will not be able to do it in the same way 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.190
 way they will wonder how they are placed 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.380
 the brazen reasons do not worry 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.480
 these are placed in the same way only 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.310
 that produce a little itch I 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.430
 I recommend that in the same fold as 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.280
 did with the tapes and ready do not forget 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.450
 own each part of your points well 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.610
 that your body is the tool 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:57.050
 adif up to the channel write your 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.050
