this<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.730> about<00:00:36.000> their<00:00:36.329> overclocking

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
this is about their overclocking

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:54.290 
this is about their overclocking
software<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:37.890> they<00:00:38.040> include<00:00:52.789> so<00:00:53.789> this<00:00:54.149> is

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
software that they include so this is

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.810 
software that they include so this is
the<00:00:54.449> MSI<00:00:55.050> version<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:56.059> the<00:00:57.059> 480<00:00:57.809> GTX<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:59.039> lot<00:00:59.699> of

the videos online

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.590 
the videos online
I've<00:01:01.079> seen<00:01:01.579> people<00:01:02.579> really<00:01:02.850> like<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.210> EVGA

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
I've seen people really like the EVGA

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.840 
I've seen people really like the EVGA
version<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.860> they<00:01:04.920> get<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.220> super<00:01:05.580> clock

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
version and they get the super clock

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.210 
version and they get the super clock
version<00:01:06.390> I'm<00:01:07.229> actually<00:01:07.470> going<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.830> be<00:01:07.979> water

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
version I'm actually going to be water

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.950 
version I'm actually going to be water
cooling<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.390> I'll<00:01:09.570> be<00:01:09.750> able<00:01:09.840> to

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
cooling this so I'll be able to

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.530 
cooling this so I'll be able to
overclock<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:11.070> pretty<00:01:11.880> much<00:01:12.060> wherever<00:01:12.299> I

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
overclock it to pretty much wherever I

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.440 
overclock it to pretty much wherever I
want<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.920> didn't<00:01:14.430> really<00:01:14.640> feel<00:01:14.970> like<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.270> needed

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
want I didn't really feel like I needed

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.310 
want I didn't really feel like I needed
to<00:01:15.570> spend<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.020> money<00:01:16.170> on<00:01:16.820> the<00:01:17.820> EVGA<00:01:18.320> version

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
to spend the money on the EVGA version

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.130 
to spend the money on the EVGA version
it<00:01:19.470> was<00:01:19.560> like<00:01:19.770> 40<00:01:20.549> or<00:01:20.670> 50<00:01:21.000> bucks<00:01:21.030> or<00:01:21.390> more<00:01:21.570> so<00:01:21.900> it

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
it was like 40 or 50 bucks or more so it

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.390 
it was like 40 or 50 bucks or more so it
didn't<00:01:22.350> really<00:01:22.380> make<00:01:22.619> sense<00:01:22.830> for<00:01:23.070> me<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.280> do

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
didn't really make sense for me to do

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.330 
didn't really make sense for me to do
that<00:01:24.020> so<00:01:25.020> I've<00:01:25.259> just<00:01:25.290> got<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.799> cheapest<00:01:26.189> one

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
that so I've just got the cheapest one

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.359 
that so I've just got the cheapest one
they<00:01:26.549> had<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:27.030> got<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:27.600> on<00:01:27.780> Newegg<00:01:28.250> and<00:01:29.250> I'll

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:04.770 

plastic<00:01:57.310> cover<00:02:02.310> money<00:02:03.310> box<00:02:03.640> okay<00:02:04.270> so<00:02:04.329> this<00:02:04.600> is

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
plastic cover money box okay so this is

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.400 
plastic cover money box okay so this is
covering<00:02:05.140> up<00:02:05.320> some<00:02:05.530> of<00:02:05.619> the<00:02:05.680> parts<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.410> DVI

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
covering up some of the parts so the DVI

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:15.300 
covering up some of the parts so the DVI
VGA<00:02:08.679> VGA<00:02:09.580> adapter<00:02:12.209> this<00:02:13.209> is<00:02:13.890> six<00:02:14.890> pin<00:02:15.069> power

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
VGA VGA adapter this is six pin power

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.400 
VGA VGA adapter this is six pin power
adapter<00:02:15.910> so<00:02:16.239> if<00:02:16.330> you<00:02:16.510> if<00:02:16.810> you<00:02:16.930> don't<00:02:17.110> have<00:02:17.230> the

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
adapter so if you if you don't have the

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.410 
adapter so if you if you don't have the
right<00:02:17.560> connections<00:02:18.160> you<00:02:18.459> can<00:02:18.610> use<00:02:18.760> two<00:02:18.970> molex

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
right connections you can use two molex

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.370 
right connections you can use two molex
connectors<00:02:19.989> and<00:02:20.319> hook<00:02:20.980> this<00:02:21.130> up<00:02:22.170> probably<00:02:23.170> not

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
connectors and hook this up probably not

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.380 
connectors and hook this up probably not
a<00:02:23.410> good<00:02:23.620> idea<00:02:23.769> if<00:02:24.370> you<00:02:24.519> don't<00:02:24.640> have<00:02:24.849> these<00:02:25.120> kind

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
a good idea if you don't have these kind

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.360 
a good idea if you don't have these kind
of<00:02:25.450> connectors<00:02:25.900> on<00:02:26.019> your<00:02:26.140> power<00:02:26.349> supply<00:02:26.530> your

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
of connectors on your power supply your

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.740 
of connectors on your power supply your
power<00:02:27.610> supply<00:02:27.910> is<00:02:27.970> probably<00:02:28.299> not<00:02:28.420> powerful

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
power supply is probably not powerful

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.660 
power supply is probably not powerful
enough<00:02:28.930> for<00:02:29.140> this<00:02:29.380> card<00:02:30.840> here's<00:02:31.840> a<00:02:31.959> DVI<00:02:32.830> HDMI

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
enough for this card here's a DVI HDMI

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.210 
enough for this card here's a DVI HDMI
adapter<00:02:36.780> there's<00:02:37.780> a<00:02:37.840> six<00:02:38.260> pin<00:02:38.500> to<00:02:38.769> eight<00:02:38.950> pin
