I<00:00:00.089> wish<00:00:00.390> you<00:00:00.539> could<00:00:00.690> smell<00:00:00.870> it<00:00:01.170> I<00:00:01.350> couldn't

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
I wish you could smell it I couldn't

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.519 
I wish you could smell it I couldn't

afford the new canvas that capture the
scent<00:00:04.890> even<00:00:05.430> if<00:00:05.520> I<00:00:05.580> did<00:00:05.819> you<00:00:06.029> probably

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
scent even if I did you probably

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.750 
scent even if I did you probably
wouldn't<00:00:06.990> have<00:00:07.109> one<00:00:07.350> of<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:07.560> computers<00:00:08.069> that

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
wouldn't have one of the computers that

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:20.540 
wouldn't have one of the computers that
play<00:00:09.000> it<00:00:09.150> back<00:00:18.050> if<00:00:19.050> you<00:00:19.650> saw<00:00:19.830> part<00:00:20.100> one<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.340> this

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
play it back if you saw part one of this

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.250 
play it back if you saw part one of this
series<00:00:20.609> you<00:00:21.210> know<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.510> we've<00:00:21.660> had<00:00:21.689> some<00:00:22.080> meat

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
series you know that we've had some meat

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.859 
series you know that we've had some meat
smoking<00:00:22.680> in<00:00:22.800> this<00:00:22.939> smokehouse<00:00:23.939> right<00:00:24.210> here<00:00:24.510> it

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
smoking in this smokehouse right here it

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.359 
smoking in this smokehouse right here it
should<00:00:25.140> be<00:00:25.260> done<00:00:25.439> now<00:00:25.680> so<00:00:25.710> we're<00:00:26.070> gonna<00:00:26.130> go

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
should be done now so we're gonna go

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.960 
should be done now so we're gonna go
check<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:27.650> by<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.710> way<00:00:28.980> from<00:00:29.279> lessons<00:00:29.699> learned

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
check it by the way from lessons learned

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.470 
check it by the way from lessons learned
I<00:00:30.240> have<00:00:30.750> done<00:00:31.230> smoking<00:00:31.920> in<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.489> place<00:00:33.030> like<00:00:33.180> this

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
I have done smoking in a place like this

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.310 
I have done smoking in a place like this
before<00:00:33.690> but<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:34.800> was<00:00:34.950> more<00:00:35.160> like<00:00:35.340> that<00:00:35.640> tall

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
before but it was more like that tall

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.020 
before but it was more like that tall
the<00:00:37.320> smoke<00:00:37.590> would<00:00:37.770> go<00:00:37.950> up<00:00:38.190> into<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.579> roof<00:00:38.760> area

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
the smoke would go up into the roof area

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.850 
the smoke would go up into the roof area
like<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.660> would<00:00:39.750> be<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.840> cloud<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.260> smoke<00:00:40.590> in

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
like it would be a cloud of smoke in

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.650 
like it would be a cloud of smoke in
this<00:00:40.980> little<00:00:41.309> building<00:00:41.520> anything<00:00:42.210> more<00:00:42.450> than

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
this little building anything more than

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.350 
this little building anything more than
a<00:00:42.690> light<00:00:42.960> breeze<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.640> this<00:00:44.640> building<00:00:45.000> clears

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
a light breeze and this building clears

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.090 
a light breeze and this building clears
out<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.719> smoke<00:00:45.960> because<00:00:46.440> there's<00:00:46.649> not<00:00:46.800> enough

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
out of smoke because there's not enough

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.420 
out of smoke because there's not enough
volume<00:00:47.700> above<00:00:48.440> the<00:00:49.440> top<00:00:49.710> edge<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.219> doorway

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
volume above the top edge of the doorway

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.369 
volume above the top edge of the doorway
so<00:00:51.090> what<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.480> would<00:00:51.600> do<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.989> next<00:00:52.110> time<00:00:52.350> around

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
so what I would do the next time around

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.330 
so what I would do the next time around
is<00:00:52.920> hang<00:00:53.699> one<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:53.969> these<00:00:54.090> canvas<00:00:54.690> tarps<00:00:55.340> right

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
is hang one of these canvas tarps right

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.099 
is hang one of these canvas tarps right
here<00:00:56.550> over<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.850> doorway<00:00:57.090> we're<00:00:57.719> gonna<00:00:57.840> take<00:00:58.079> a

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
here over the doorway we're gonna take a

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.349 
here over the doorway we're gonna take a
look<00:00:58.320> at<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.500> meat<00:00:58.649> now<00:00:58.910> it<00:00:59.910> just<00:01:00.090> took<00:01:00.239> a

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
look at the meat now it just took a

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.689 
look at the meat now it just took a
little<00:01:00.539> longer<00:01:00.840> than<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.770> really<00:01:02.039> wanted<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.520> to

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
little longer than I really wanted it to

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.520 
little longer than I really wanted it to
I<00:01:02.910> had<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.329> come<00:01:03.539> out<00:01:03.570> here<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:03.930> check<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.229> more

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
I had to come out here and check it more

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.950 
I had to come out here and check it more
often<00:01:06.740> I'd<00:01:07.740> say<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.189> had<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.400> total<00:01:08.689> smoke<00:01:09.689> time

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
often I'd say it had a total smoke time

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.260 
often I'd say it had a total smoke time
of<00:01:10.200> 20<00:01:10.560> hours<00:01:10.950> I'm<00:01:11.159> gonna<00:01:11.310> take<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.670> outside<00:01:11.850> to

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
of 20 hours I'm gonna take it outside to

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.850 
of 20 hours I'm gonna take it outside to
smell<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.659> because<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:13.080> whole<00:01:13.229> place<00:01:13.560> smells

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
smell it because this whole place smells

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.310 
smell it because this whole place smells
smoky<00:01:16.850> that's<00:01:17.850> got<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.060> nice<00:01:18.330> light<00:01:18.720> smoke<00:01:19.110> to

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
smoky that's got a nice light smoke to

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.649 
smoky that's got a nice light smoke to
it<00:01:19.350> my<00:01:19.860> critique<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.490> my<00:01:20.670> own<00:01:20.850> work<00:01:21.119> would<00:01:21.479> be

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
it my critique of my own work would be

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.499 
it my critique of my own work would be
that<00:01:22.189> there's<00:01:23.189> probably<00:01:23.460> too<00:01:23.670> much<00:01:23.700> oak<00:01:24.150> Oak

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
that there's probably too much oak Oak

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.990 
that there's probably too much oak Oak
has<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.840> lot<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.140> tannins<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.549> this<00:01:26.790> is<00:01:26.970> a

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
has a lot of tannins and so this is a

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.679 
has a lot of tannins and so this is a
little<00:01:27.360> bit<00:01:27.509> more<00:01:27.720> accurate<00:01:29.360> smoke<00:01:30.360> than<00:01:30.570> I

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
little bit more accurate smoke than I

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.260 
little bit more accurate smoke than I
would<00:01:30.869> prefer<00:01:31.320> if<00:01:31.740> we<00:01:32.009> had<00:01:32.100> used<00:01:32.340> hackberry<00:01:33.030> or

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
would prefer if we had used hackberry or

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.670 
would prefer if we had used hackberry or
Sycamore<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.930> would<00:01:34.049> be<00:01:34.170> terrible

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
Sycamore that would be terrible

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.960 
Sycamore that would be terrible
Hickory<00:01:35.220> would<00:01:35.400> have<00:01:35.490> been<00:01:35.579> better<00:01:35.820> and

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
Hickory would have been better and

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.910 
Hickory would have been better and
mesquite<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.630> did<00:01:36.960> have<00:01:37.170> some<00:01:37.380> fruit<00:01:37.619> wood<00:01:37.799> in

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
mesquite I did have some fruit wood in

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.710 
mesquite I did have some fruit wood in
there<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.250> crabapple<00:01:38.850> tree<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.570> was

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
there that crabapple tree and that was

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.270 
there that crabapple tree and that was
nice<00:01:39.930> some<00:01:40.409> pear<00:01:40.650> would<00:01:40.860> have<00:01:40.950> been<00:01:41.100> good

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
nice some pear would have been good

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.060 
nice some pear would have been good
cherry<00:01:41.869> if<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:43.079> had<00:01:43.170> had<00:01:43.350> more<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.829> and

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
cherry if I had had more of that and

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.560 
cherry if I had had more of that and
less<00:01:44.250> oak<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.640> would<00:01:44.729> have<00:01:44.820> been<00:01:44.939> ideal<00:01:45.119> I

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
less oak it would have been ideal I

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.840 
less oak it would have been ideal I
would<00:01:45.869> put<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.170> on<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.350> category<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.159> I

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
would put it on the category of I

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.569 
would put it on the category of I
wouldn't<00:01:48.210> say<00:01:48.360> excellent<00:01:48.930> maybe<00:01:49.860> very<00:01:50.250> good

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
wouldn't say excellent maybe very good

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.850 
wouldn't say excellent maybe very good
but<00:01:51.210> definitely<00:01:51.659> good<00:01:51.840> we'll<00:01:52.229> take<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.500> inside

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
but definitely good we'll take it inside

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.060 
but definitely good we'll take it inside
slice<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.610> fry<00:01:54.390> up<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.689> piece<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.229> see<00:01:55.860> how<00:01:56.009> it

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
slice it fry up a piece and see how it

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.410 
slice it fry up a piece and see how it
