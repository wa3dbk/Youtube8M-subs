 which as you have seen at the beginning 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.640
 of the video I'm going to show you how 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:20.279

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.710
 series for this monitor x that is a 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.460
 totally free plane with that good 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.640
 You have already seen the comparison of 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:32.899
 of the df sx itself of how the game looks 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.180
 with the hoe activated and not activated and 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:37.719

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.740
 spectacular improvement tell you that you will have

 This is a 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.270
 it's a configuration worth it does not become 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.880
 an add-on is a configuration and good 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.830
 there are many, but I have 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.230
 tested enough and with whom I stay 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.360

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.010

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.930
 description is good and well then 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.670
 installation is very easy to extract the 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.619
 winrar file is valid and will leave you this 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.979
 folder and well then here you have a 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:45.300
 series of screen shorts with atom 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.820
 activated so you can see everything 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.530
 we are interested in this as 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.230
 let's install very easy let's go to the 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.960
 home computer local disk files 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:59.490
 microsoft game program but microsoft 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.080
 game and in which sofres monitor x eye can 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.170
 that you do not have this folder of 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.200
 installation of the game you can if the 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.900
 you have installed who directly in 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.940
 the equipment or anything 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.830
 you go to the root folder where you will visit the 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.780
 game is worth in my case is here but not 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.970
 it is yours can not and simply 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.730
 let's do this let's take these 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.320
 three these files these seven files 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:27.540
 and what are we going to do six sorry and 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:30.020
 except for the scripts okay we're going to 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.380
 copy them 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.240
 and we are going to stick them here to me as you see 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.880
 I get to copy and replace because 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.220
 I already have it installed if you can 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.710
 call install but well this we 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.200
 will come out if you do not have installed if you do not 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.930
 you have is next to no time 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.760
 previous if you have it at some time 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.410
 previous maybe you get to replace 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.190
 something but good because others replace them 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.410
 and it is already with what good because you pass it to 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.660
 oil is what you have to accept and 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.270
 well then once it has 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.980
 downloaded the forgiveness whatever since 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.050
 you have put in that folder in the 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.060
 root folder of this monitoring that already 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.650
 we will have installed with that one now 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.040
 to put very good uncle to the game so that 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.720
 see in a more detailed way the 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.910
 changes that it does with how good now we 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.050
 we see good because we are already inside the 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.720
 game we are here in the 775 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.240
 now 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.640
 As you can see it looks exactly like 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.710
 when we have the game that if not what 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.310
 we have installed that we have to do 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:35.280
 for apps to do its function 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.530
 in this very good abdÃ³n what are you going to 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.960
 have to do is going to be asif 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.310
 if you do not know what the little arrow is 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:47.750
 up that is above control and here 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:50.569
 under the capital letters let's see 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.489
 and then there's f 12 and as you see if we 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.900
 active and we are deactivated that is one of 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.390
 the advantages that we can activate and 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.370
 deactivate when we want according to the 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.750
 setting you tell him at night 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.670
 you will have to deactivate it if not 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.680
 it will look very dark this looks pretty 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.930
 good but good also I recommend you 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.650
 that deactivates it as soon as it's night 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:12.439
 while when it's sunrise and 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.000
 eating and well then let's see a 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:15.980
 little comparison of the different 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.570
 cameras that have the plane and Well 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.330
 in the cockpit, I would be without him 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:24.210
 effect is valid with white looks good but not 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.920
 It looks a bit weird and good, well, like that 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.770
 the effect as it is now looks much more 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.960
 real lighting the shadows and everything and 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.830
 good 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.180
 Well that would be normal for the game with 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.580
 the shadows that the game and the 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.580
 lighting and so it looks 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.550
 and well well with everything here you put 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.740
 even fixing at the end is worth the 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.860
 mountains has up lighting and 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:53.230
 all though good because a small video 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.270
 I wanted to bring you because it 's worse 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.860
 I consider one thing that maybe some 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.390
 of you do not know him or 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.160
 just do not know this 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.200
 configuration that for me as I've already 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.610
 said is the best with how good 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.710
 I hope you liked it I feel the 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.420
 inactivity but I do not have time to 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.920
 more and good then see you in the 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.330

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.710
 downloads you will have in the description 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.470
 I forget it 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.930
 I forgot to tell you that as you see the 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.240
 pcex recording now I'm going pretty 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.860

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:27.979
 detailed half an hour where he goes to 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.479
 teach how to do it from the 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:30.639
 zero installation 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:33.310
 where 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:35.319
 and all the changes that you have 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.699
 changes that you will have to make in the 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:42.189
 config point file and all that so that 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:44.830
 you have a fluidity an improvement of frames 

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:46.360
 without losing graphic quality because good 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.770
