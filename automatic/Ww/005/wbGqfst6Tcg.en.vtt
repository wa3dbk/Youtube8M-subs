00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
like a bit like he wasn't really

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.640 
like a bit like he wasn't really
creative<00:01:26.939> but<00:01:27.180> with<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.540> when<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.170> saw<00:01:28.439> him<00:01:28.530> I

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
creative but with the when I saw him I

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.429 
creative but with the when I saw him I
didn't<00:01:28.920> think<00:01:29.070> you'd<00:01:29.280> be<00:01:29.400> creative<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.439> I

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
didn't think you'd be creative so I

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.710 
didn't think you'd be creative so I
suppose<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:32.100> got<00:01:32.610> was<00:01:32.850> expecting<00:01:33.450> for<00:01:33.630> my

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
suppose I got was expecting for my

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.270 
suppose I got was expecting for my
return<00:01:34.079> I<00:01:34.320> just<00:01:34.560> thought<00:01:34.710> he's<00:01:34.890> finishing

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
very creative and his goals were pretty

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.149 
very creative and his goals were pretty
much<00:01:59.009> almost<00:01:59.280> all<00:01:59.729> gifted<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.570> him<00:02:00.829> so<00:02:01.829> yeah

don't<00:02:02.610> look<00:02:02.759> down<00:02:02.909> his<00:02:03.090> dribbling<00:02:03.390> was<00:02:03.479> really

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
don't look down his dribbling was really

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.959 
don't look down his dribbling was really
nice<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.350> he's<00:02:05.070> good<00:02:05.280> link<00:02:05.490> up<00:02:05.579> late<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.790> ka

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
nice and he's good link up late of ka

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.490 
nice and he's good link up late of ka
that<00:02:06.360> really<00:02:06.509> really<00:02:06.630> nice<00:02:06.810> actually<00:02:07.170> from

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
that really really nice actually from

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.339 
that really really nice actually from
deloitte<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.550> overall<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.239> team<00:02:09.509> like<00:02:10.050> I

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
deloitte and overall the team like I

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.600 
deloitte and overall the team like I
think<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:10.830> might<00:02:10.950> be<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.129> fact<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.340> these

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
think it might be the fact that these

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.520 
think it might be the fact that these
two<00:02:11.879> strikers<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.959> strike<00:02:13.290> is

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
two strikers the strike is

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.199 
two strikers the strike is
you<00:02:13.709> wouldn't<00:02:14.100> shoot<00:02:14.220> him<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.730> partner

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
you wouldn't shoot him the partner

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.030 
you wouldn't shoot him the partner
together<00:02:15.390> which<00:02:16.290> could<00:02:16.530> be<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:16.620> problem<00:02:16.680> as

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
together which could be a problem as

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.650 
together which could be a problem as
well<00:02:17.160> probably<00:02:17.970> better<00:02:18.150> if<00:02:18.300> you've<00:02:18.480> got

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
well probably better if you've got

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.449 
well probably better if you've got
someone<00:02:18.990> more<00:02:19.440> of<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.680> ballplayer<00:02:20.130> a<00:02:20.310> bit

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
someone more of a ballplayer a bit

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.930 
someone more of a ballplayer a bit
faster<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.150> go<00:02:21.300> with<00:02:21.540> him<00:02:22.280> it<00:02:23.280> would<00:02:23.610> have

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
faster to go with him it would have

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.090 
faster to go with him it would have
worked<00:02:24.540> better<00:02:24.690> because<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.560> team<00:02:25.740> bandit

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
worked better because the team bandit

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.970 
worked better because the team bandit
was<00:02:26.190> already<00:02:26.490> nice<00:02:26.670> like<00:02:26.940> with<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.300> likes<00:02:27.540> of

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
was already nice like with the likes of

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
good players on the wings were pretty

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.559 
good players on the wings were pretty
decent<00:02:35.130> in<00:02:35.310> terms<00:02:35.520> of<00:02:35.610> Pacey<00:02:35.880> to<00:02:36.239> knock<00:02:36.450> the

Deloitte a preferred so much more and
that<00:02:40.890> was<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.040> really<00:02:41.250> nice<00:02:41.459> finished<00:02:41.850> from
