00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
last night in the spur of the moment I

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.040 
last night in the spur of the moment I
decided<00:03:00.830> to<00:03:01.100> put<00:03:01.340> flexi<00:03:01.790> rods<00:03:02.000> in<00:03:02.480> the<00:03:02.840> hair

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
decided to put flexi rods in the hair

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.840 
decided to put flexi rods in the hair
just<00:03:03.380> to<00:03:03.530> curl<00:03:03.830> in<00:03:03.980> and<00:03:04.100> see<00:03:04.280> how<00:03:04.430> well<00:03:04.640> this

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
just to curl in and see how well this

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.150 
just to curl in and see how well this
hair<00:03:05.120> can<00:03:05.360> hold<00:03:05.600> the<00:03:05.720> curl<00:03:05.989> this<00:03:06.380> morning<00:03:06.950> I

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
hair can hold the curl this morning I

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.720 
hair can hold the curl this morning I
took<00:03:07.250> them<00:03:07.670> out<00:03:07.910> and<00:03:08.209> it's<00:03:09.200> going<00:03:09.860> on<00:03:10.070> 4<00:03:10.340> p.m.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
took them out and it's going on 4 p.m.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.990 
took them out and it's going on 4 p.m.
now<00:03:10.970> and<00:03:11.300> this<00:03:12.110> is<00:03:12.350> how<00:03:12.380> the<00:03:12.769> curls<00:03:13.370> hands<00:03:13.790> up

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.559 

so<00:03:17.000> this<00:03:17.300> is<00:03:17.570> hair<00:03:18.530> that<00:03:18.890> can<00:03:19.190> curl<00:03:19.819> and<00:03:20.120> hold

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:33.530 
saw the closure I was a bit scared

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.670 
saw the closure I was a bit scared
because<00:06:33.770> the<00:06:34.310> closures<00:06:34.820> lace<00:06:35.449> was<00:06:35.840> brown<00:06:36.289> in

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680 
because the closures lace was brown in

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.670 
because the closures lace was brown in
my<00:06:36.919> scalp<00:06:37.370> I<00:06:37.610> don't<00:06:38.000> have<00:06:38.210> a<00:06:38.240> brown<00:06:38.599> scalp<00:06:39.050> so<00:06:39.470> I

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 
my scalp I don't have a brown scalp so I

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.999 
my scalp I don't have a brown scalp so I
was<00:06:40.070> kind<00:06:40.400> of<00:06:40.550> skeptical<00:06:41.000> about<00:06:41.479> how<00:06:41.900> it<00:06:42.469> will

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:43.009 
was kind of skeptical about how it will

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:52.370 
was kind of skeptical about how it will
blend<00:06:43.370> in<00:06:43.610> with<00:06:43.820> my<00:06:43.880> scalp

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:52.380 

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.740 

as<00:06:52.890> you<00:06:53.130> can<00:06:53.280> see<00:06:53.580> it<00:06:53.820> blends<00:06:54.090> I'm<00:06:54.270> pretty<00:06:54.540> good

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:54.750 
as you can see it blends I'm pretty good

00:06:54.750 --> 00:07:02.030 
as you can see it blends I'm pretty good
I<00:06:58.640> will<00:06:59.640> say<00:06:59.910> this<00:07:00.180> about<00:07:00.510> the<00:07:00.990> closure<00:07:01.290> when<00:07:02.010> I

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:02.040 
I will say this about the closure when I

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.420 
I will say this about the closure when I
was<00:07:02.220> wearing<00:07:02.370> it<00:07:02.610> in<00:07:02.760> its<00:07:02.910> natural<00:07:03.150> state<00:07:03.420> the

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:04.430 
was wearing it in its natural state the

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:08.240 
was wearing it in its natural state the
closures<00:07:05.430> body<00:07:05.880> wave<00:07:06.240> pattern<00:07:07.200> was<00:07:07.830> almost

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:08.250 
closures body wave pattern was almost

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.580 
closures body wave pattern was almost
non-existent<00:07:08.490> I<00:07:09.360> would<00:07:09.690> have<00:07:09.900> to<00:07:10.050> wet<00:07:10.380> the

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:10.590 
non-existent I would have to wet the

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.290 
non-existent I would have to wet the
closure<00:07:10.860> just<00:07:11.220> so<00:07:11.370> that<00:07:11.520> I<00:07:11.550> could<00:07:11.700> wave<00:07:11.970> up<00:07:12.150> a

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:12.300 
closure just so that I could wave up a

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.440 
closure just so that I could wave up a
little<00:07:12.510> bit<00:07:12.780> but<00:07:13.490> it<00:07:14.490> was<00:07:14.730> like<00:07:14.880> nowhere<00:07:15.240> to<00:07:15.330> be

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:15.450 
little bit but it was like nowhere to be

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:17.930 
little bit but it was like nowhere to be
found<00:07:15.480> I<00:07:16.020> don't<00:07:16.200> know<00:07:16.370> what<00:07:17.370> happened<00:07:17.760> so<00:07:17.910> that

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:17.940 
found I don't know what happened so that

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.020 
found I don't know what happened so that
we<00:07:18.300> pattern<00:07:19.220> when<00:07:20.220> I<00:07:20.250> was<00:07:20.460> wearing<00:07:20.610> a<00:07:20.760> hair<00:07:20.940> and

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:21.030 
we pattern when I was wearing a hair and

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:24.050 
we pattern when I was wearing a hair and
it's<00:07:21.180> natural<00:07:21.720> up<00:07:22.020> in<00:07:22.800> this<00:07:23.010> natural<00:07:23.250> pattern

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:24.060 
it's natural up in this natural pattern

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.380 
it's natural up in this natural pattern
I<00:07:24.330> did<00:07:24.750> get<00:07:24.960> a<00:07:25.020> lot<00:07:25.260> of<00:07:25.410> snacks<00:07:25.650> but

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:26.390 
I did get a lot of snacks but

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:30.410
