Hi guys, its Cindy Lietz, your Polymer Clay
Tutor, and today's Studio Tip is how to remove

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.389
fingerprints from Polymer Clay.

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:19.240
Now I've been talking about avoiding fingerprints,
and so actually when I wanted to do this video,

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.820
I had to actually make some samples with some
fingerprints on them, because I don't have

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.010
fingerprints on my beads anymore.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:33.480
But, so here I have a couple of baked samples,
now you may or may not be able to pick up

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.950
on the fingerprints on there, so I'll just
rub a little chalk on one of them just to

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:45.270
show you that they are indeed there, and in
fact, there's a little funny line here that's

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.070
from a cut on my finger, so the fingerprints
are there.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:57.530
Now to remove them after they have been baked
what you can do is use a product like Acetone.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:06.030
Now this is a product you can usually find…they
use it in car repair and that kind of thing,

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.010
sometimes in some of the paint stores, you'll
be able to find it.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:15.990
It's inside some nail polishes, but you'll
find that in nail polish, it isn't quite strong

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.990
enough, so you'll wanna use the pure acetone.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.640
And I'm just going to use a Q-tip and dip
it in there, this stuff is terrible smelling

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.840
and it evaporates really fast, so you wanna
kind of avoid it…having it open for very

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.840
long.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:40.189
Now all you need to do is just rub it on to
your clay and it will erase the fingerprints.

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:45.790
Now I've been doing this, you know, for quite
a long time, we've got it on the blog…some

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:52.670
information on it, but then I remembered about
it when a couple of people from the last tutorial

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.270
mentioned it again, so I thought I'd better
show you how it works.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:02.700
So I'm just rubbing around here, and basically
what this chemical does is it melts the surface

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.060
of the clay.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:11.009
Now at first, you're gonna end up with all
these kind of smeary marks, but I'm just erasing

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.700
away, and you can see its working ‘cause
it's coming off onto the Q-tip here, and if

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.200
I'm careful with… and spend a little time
at it I'll get every single last one of those

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.560
little things removed.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.560
Now, well I'd work a little bit harder on
it, but I'll show you with the chalk again,

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:40.060
that it's pretty much all of its gone, so
I'll just rub it on there, I can see a few

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.450
spots here where I've missed it and I would
keep going with that.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.560
Now it also works really well for removing
shiny spots on the back of your piece, now

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:55.770
if you bake your Polymer Clay on a…something
that's shiny like a glass tile or a metal

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.640
pan or something, you'll get shiny marks on
the bottom of your pieces, so this will remove

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.750
that as well, I'll get some more, it evaporates
like I said, really fast, and you'll be able

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:15.349
to remove those shiny marks right away, it
goes to a matte finish almost in no time.

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:20.840
Now, you'll need to be super careful with
this, don't leave it anywhere near a flame

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.420
or anything like that, it's highly flammable.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.170
I actually would prefer to just avoid fingerprints
in the first place but this works great for

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.709
some of those places where you can't sand
or you have issues like that.

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:40.989
So I hope that was helpful for you, and if
it was, make sure to click that Like button

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:42.680
that would be great.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.379
And my question for you is, have you ever
used acetone before and do you think you will

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:50.700
use it to remove any flaws on your Polymer
Clay?

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.980
Leave those answers in the comment section
below, that would be great.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:00.019
