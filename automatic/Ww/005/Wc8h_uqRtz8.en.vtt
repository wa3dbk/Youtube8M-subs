four thousand dollars a three-chip unit

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.850 
four thousand dollars a three-chip unit
is<00:02:39.060> about<00:02:39.330> eight<00:02:39.510> thousand<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:40.380> that's<00:02:40.620> just

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
is about eight thousand and that's just

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.590 
is about eight thousand and that's just
for<00:02:41.010> one<00:02:41.040> gauge<00:02:41.580> this<00:02:41.880> is<00:02:42.030> a<00:02:42.060> regular<00:02:42.480> eight

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
for one gauge this is a regular eight

for one gauge this is a regular eight
machine<00:02:42.989> and<00:02:43.290> if<00:02:43.950> you've<00:02:44.070> got<00:02:44.130> Super<00:02:44.489> eight

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
machine and if you've got Super eight

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.789 
machine and if you've got Super eight
you<00:02:44.760> need<00:02:44.940> another<00:02:45.180> machine<00:02:45.390> as<00:02:45.750> well<00:02:45.930> so<00:02:46.320> if

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
you need another machine as well so if

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.560 
you need another machine as well so if
you<00:02:46.980> wanted<00:02:47.280> a<00:02:47.459> three-chip<00:02:48.120> like<00:02:48.330> these<00:02:48.540> I

mean you've got sixteen thousand dollars
outlay<00:02:51.540> right<00:02:51.810> there<00:02:52.080> plus<00:02:52.320> it<00:02:52.500> doesn't

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
outlay right there plus it doesn't

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.039 
outlay right there plus it doesn't
include<00:02:53.239> recording<00:02:54.239> equipment<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:54.900> most

include recording equipment and most

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.610 
include recording equipment and most
importantly<00:02:55.680> time<00:02:56.209> so<00:02:57.209> I'm<00:02:58.200> going<00:02:58.350> to<00:02:58.380> quickly

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
importantly time so I'm going to quickly

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.620 
importantly time so I'm going to quickly
unbolt<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.580> side<00:02:59.820> here<00:03:00.000> so<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:00.209> can<00:03:00.360> see<00:03:00.480> the

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
unbolt the side here so you can see the

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.360 
unbolt the side here so you can see the
camera<00:03:01.019> and<00:03:01.200> how<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.350> inner<00:03:01.590> workings<00:03:02.130> work

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
camera and how the inner workings work

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.280 
camera and how the inner workings work
inside<00:03:03.060> of<00:03:03.120> this<00:03:03.450> machine<00:03:03.870> is<00:03:03.900> just<00:03:04.200> a

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
inside of this machine is just a

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
inside of this machine is just a
conglomeration<00:03:05.160> of<00:03:05.519> circuit<00:03:05.880> boards<00:03:06.209> and

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
conglomeration of circuit boards and

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.699 
conglomeration of circuit boards and
wiring<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.519> it<00:03:09.269> is<00:03:09.420> a<00:03:09.450> frame-by-frame<00:03:09.840> scan

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
wiring and it is a frame-by-frame scan

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.850 
wiring and it is a frame-by-frame scan
that<00:03:11.220> method<00:03:12.180> gets<00:03:12.630> thrown<00:03:13.049> around<00:03:13.230> left<00:03:13.680> and

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
that method gets thrown around left and

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.560 
that method gets thrown around left and
right<00:03:14.100> but<00:03:14.340> basically<00:03:14.760> it<00:03:15.000> is<00:03:15.120> taking<00:03:15.480> a

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
right but basically it is taking a

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.030 
right but basically it is taking a
picture<00:03:15.750> of<00:03:15.930> every<00:03:16.230> single<00:03:16.530> frame<00:03:16.709> of<00:03:16.860> thumb

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
picture of every single frame of thumb

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.160 
picture of every single frame of thumb
so<00:03:17.190> when<00:03:17.340> you<00:03:17.400> look<00:03:17.579> on<00:03:17.760> your<00:03:17.910> DVD<00:03:18.750> and<00:03:18.930> hit<00:03:19.079> the

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
so when you look on your DVD and hit the

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.360 
so when you look on your DVD and hit the
pause<00:03:19.350> button<00:03:19.590> go<00:03:19.799> through<00:03:19.980> frame<00:03:20.190> by<00:03:20.340> frame

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
pause button go through frame by frame

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.569 
pause button go through frame by frame
it<00:03:20.790> is<00:03:20.910> a<00:03:20.940> crisp<00:03:21.299> image<00:03:21.720> all<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.110> way<00:03:22.200> through

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
it is a crisp image all the way through

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.800 
it is a crisp image all the way through
so<00:03:23.579> I'm<00:03:23.820> going<00:03:23.940> to<00:03:24.000> take<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.239> side<00:03:24.450> off<00:03:24.600> here

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
so I'm going to take the side off here

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.840 
so I'm going to take the side off here
and<00:03:24.930> you<00:03:24.989> can<00:03:25.140> see<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:26.070> inner<00:03:26.430> workings<00:03:26.760> of

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
and you can see the inner workings of

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.630 
and you can see the inner workings of
the<00:03:26.970> camera<00:03:27.920> okay<00:03:28.920> so<00:03:28.980> here<00:03:29.400> we<00:03:29.459> are<00:03:29.489> we're

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
the camera okay so here we are we're

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.140 
the camera okay so here we are we're
taking<00:03:29.880> the<00:03:29.940> last<00:03:30.150> screw

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.280 

unplugged<00:03:34.150> it<00:03:34.330> so<00:03:34.480> what<00:03:34.659> most<00:03:34.840> people<00:03:35.110> think

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
unplugged it so what most people think

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.750 
unplugged it so what most people think
is<00:03:35.530> behind<00:03:35.799> our<00:03:35.980> units<00:03:36.370> here<00:03:36.519> there's<00:03:36.670> gonna

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
is behind our units here there's gonna

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.850 
is behind our units here there's gonna
be<00:03:36.909> a<00:03:36.940> big<00:03:37.150> camera<00:03:37.540> and<00:03:37.810> there<00:03:38.379> actually<00:03:38.709> isn't

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
be a big camera and there actually isn't

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.479 
be a big camera and there actually isn't
so<00:03:39.040> when<00:03:39.250> I<00:03:39.280> take<00:03:39.519> this<00:03:39.700> off<00:03:40.379> very<00:03:41.379> gently<00:03:41.769> the

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
so when I take this off very gently the

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.479 
so when I take this off very gently the
camera<00:03:43.030> is<00:03:43.450> actually<00:03:43.900> right<00:03:44.500> here<00:03:44.920> this<00:03:45.129> tiny

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
camera is actually right here this tiny

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.339 
camera is actually right here this tiny
little<00:03:45.670> thing<00:03:45.819> here<00:03:46.360> just<00:03:46.599> a<00:03:46.720> circuit<00:03:47.200> board

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
little thing here just a circuit board

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.949 
little thing here just a circuit board
and<00:03:47.739> there's<00:03:48.190> a<00:03:48.250> magnifying<00:03:48.819> lens<00:03:49.150> right<00:03:49.900> here

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
and there's a magnifying lens right here

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.809 
and there's a magnifying lens right here
and<00:03:50.560> then<00:03:50.890> it<00:03:51.010> just<00:03:51.160> goes<00:03:51.310> straight<00:03:51.430> off<00:03:51.670> the

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
and then it just goes straight off the

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.990 
and then it just goes straight off the
gate<00:03:51.970> so<00:03:52.180> you've<00:03:52.420> got<00:03:52.660> literally<00:03:53.400> about<00:03:54.400> four

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
gate so you've got literally about four

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.449 
gate so you've got literally about four
inches<00:03:55.569> three<00:03:55.930> and<00:03:56.049> a<00:03:56.080> half<00:03:56.200> four<00:03:56.530> inches<00:03:56.950> from

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
inches three and a half four inches from

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.850 
inches three and a half four inches from
the<00:03:57.640> actual<00:03:57.940> lens<00:03:58.120> of<00:03:58.360> the<00:03:58.480> camera<00:03:58.590> to<00:03:59.590> the

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
the actual lens of the camera to the

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.280 
the actual lens of the camera to the
gate<00:04:00.099> and<00:04:00.430> compared<00:04:01.360> to<00:04:01.540> when<00:04:01.750> I've<00:04:01.870> shown<00:04:02.140> you

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
gate and compared to when I've shown you

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.170 
gate and compared to when I've shown you
previously<00:04:02.500> on<00:04:03.099> that<00:04:03.549> other<00:04:03.670> unit<00:04:04.060> where

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
previously on that other unit where

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.990 
previously on that other unit where
you've<00:04:04.299> got<00:04:04.480> three<00:04:04.989> feet<00:04:05.500> of<00:04:06.000> distance

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
you've got three feet of distance

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.640 
you've got three feet of distance
between<00:04:07.239> the<00:04:07.629> two<00:04:07.870> and<00:04:08.079> again<00:04:08.230> this<00:04:08.410> is

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
between the two and again this is

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.069 
between the two and again this is
completely<00:04:09.190> enclosed<00:04:09.640> so<00:04:09.970> it's<00:04:10.120> dark<00:04:10.450> there's

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079 
completely enclosed so it's dark there's

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:12.839 
completely enclosed so it's dark there's
no<00:04:11.290> interference<00:04:11.799> from<00:04:12.099> light<00:04:12.340> whatsoever

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:12.849 
no interference from light whatsoever

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:16.860 
no interference from light whatsoever
and<00:04:13.620> it<00:04:14.620> is<00:04:14.859> just<00:04:15.160> that<00:04:15.849> there's<00:04:16.090> no<00:04:16.150> focus

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
and it is just that there's no focus

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.830 
and it is just that there's no focus
it's<00:04:17.019> all<00:04:17.229> automatic<00:04:17.680> focus<00:04:18.370> the<00:04:19.060> camera<00:04:19.479> is

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
it's all automatic focus the camera is

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.230 
it's all automatic focus the camera is
bolted<00:04:20.560> down<00:04:20.799> so<00:04:21.100> it<00:04:21.250> cannot<00:04:21.639> move<00:04:21.880> it<00:04:22.120> is

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
bolted down so it cannot move it is

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.050 
bolted down so it cannot move it is
static<00:04:22.930> on<00:04:23.110> the<00:04:23.169> actual<00:04:23.949> gate<00:04:24.220> is<00:04:24.430> getting

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
static on the actual gate is getting

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.939 
static on the actual gate is getting
there's<00:04:25.510> an<00:04:25.630> enlarged<00:04:25.960> gate<00:04:26.289> in<00:04:26.470> there<00:04:26.650> so<00:04:26.830> you

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:26.949 
there's an enlarged gate in there so you

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:29.070 
there's an enlarged gate in there so you
get<00:04:27.160> in<00:04:27.250> the<00:04:27.340> full<00:04:27.669> freshly<00:04:28.180> more<00:04:28.510> frame<00:04:28.870> than

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
get in the full freshly more frame than

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.219 
get in the full freshly more frame than
you<00:04:29.169> get<00:04:29.350> on<00:04:29.440> a<00:04:29.470> projection<00:04:29.919> and<00:04:30.870> it<00:04:31.870> is<00:04:32.050> just

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
you get on a projection and it is just

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:35.490 
you get on a projection and it is just
it<00:04:32.560> is<00:04:32.680> fantastic<00:04:33.370> and<00:04:33.840> this<00:04:34.840> is<00:04:35.080> the<00:04:35.199> future

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
it is fantastic and this is the future

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.920 
it is fantastic and this is the future
of<00:04:35.530> film<00:04:35.830> transfers<00:04:36.310> here<00:04:36.639> and<00:04:36.880> ironically<00:04:37.810> a

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
of film transfers here and ironically a

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.290 
of film transfers here and ironically a
lot<00:04:38.200> of<00:04:38.289> people<00:04:38.590> that<00:04:39.400> had<00:04:39.970> the<00:04:40.060> films

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
lot of people that had the films

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.570 
lot of people that had the films
transferred<00:04:40.720> in<00:04:40.840> the<00:04:40.930> 80s<00:04:41.260> and<00:04:41.380> 90s<00:04:41.500> and<00:04:42.010> now

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
transferred in the 80s and 90s and now

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.460 
transferred in the 80s and 90s and now
coming<00:04:43.389> in<00:04:43.570> with<00:04:43.690> their<00:04:43.780> video<00:04:44.020> tapes<00:04:44.320> and

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
coming in with their video tapes and

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.779 
coming in with their video tapes and
were<00:04:44.590> saying<00:04:44.770> hey<00:04:44.889> get<00:04:45.070> a<00:04:45.099> tree<00:04:45.280> transferred

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:45.789 
were saying hey get a tree transferred

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:48.750 
were saying hey get a tree transferred
and<00:04:45.880> seeing<00:04:46.180> such<00:04:46.740> start<00:04:47.740> results<00:04:48.250> between

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
and seeing such start results between

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.730 
and seeing such start results between
what<00:04:49.510> we<00:04:49.630> used<00:04:49.810> to<00:04:49.930> be<00:04:50.020> done<00:04:50.200> and<00:04:50.440> what's<00:04:50.590> done

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
what we used to be done and what's done

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.310 
what we used to be done and what's done
today<00:04:50.919> and<00:04:51.690> hopefully<00:04:52.690> the<00:04:52.840> rest<00:04:52.990> of<00:04:53.200> the

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
today and hopefully the rest of the

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.890 
today and hopefully the rest of the
industry<00:04:53.530> will<00:04:53.860> catch<00:04:54.039> on<00:04:54.340> with<00:04:55.240> the<00:04:55.450> ensuing

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
industry will catch on with the ensuing

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.310 
industry will catch on with the ensuing
technology<00:04:56.590> so<00:04:57.479> unfortunately<00:04:58.479> most<00:04:58.930> places

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
technology so unfortunately most places

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.890 
technology so unfortunately most places
are<00:04:59.800> not<00:05:00.250> being<00:05:00.550> totally<00:05:01.240> truthful<00:05:01.450> about<00:05:01.690> how

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
are not being totally truthful about how

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.270 
are not being totally truthful about how
they<00:05:02.020> transfer<00:05:02.410> film<00:05:02.680> and<00:05:02.830> this<00:05:02.919> is<00:05:03.099> exactly

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
they transfer film and this is exactly

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.570 
they transfer film and this is exactly
why<00:05:04.030> we<00:05:04.389> here<00:05:05.200> a<00:05:05.229> got<00:05:05.470> memories<00:05:05.860> give<00:05:06.039> you<00:05:06.220> full

to step up and be honest and tell people
exactly<00:05:14.500> how<00:05:14.740> they<00:05:14.889> transfer<00:05:15.310> films<00:05:15.729> so<00:05:16.139> if

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:17.139 
exactly how they transfer films so if

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:19.080 
exactly how they transfer films so if
you<00:05:17.500> are<00:05:17.650> shopping<00:05:17.830> around<00:05:18.070> make<00:05:18.430> sure<00:05:18.460> that
