00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.879
 Today is my brother Today I want to see the Masked Rider Den-O Sword Form 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.380
 I think 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:12.330
 Sudai the future 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:15.180
 Yes I came up version is the one I was sold at theater commemoration, but here 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:19.680
 It was what I was selling normally by general sale 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:21.270
 Perhaps what is now on sale in the Legend Rider series is almost the same as this one 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.590
 I think it is not 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:30.150
 This is a general sale, and this is my version. 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:33.150
 The difference I look at the package is let's take a closer look at it or you will see 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:37.590
 At first we think that we want to go from the face to the upper body front 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:40.650
 With regard to the face, there is no such difference in the difference 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.260
 If it is forced, so is the body too but copper 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.730
 Slightly 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:51.579
 The lame-ish feel that it is my calling on the bar's so-called heavy-painted version 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:52.600
 In the case of general sales, it looks like it looks like a little peppery red, so it goes in the upper body 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:57.280
 The difference is 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:01:01.280
 First of all, the heavily painted version is painted in gold but general sales are omitted 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:06.619
 But whether Taguchi It is here here is that heavy painted version 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:10.820
 I have been painted black members of the public also sell guess is where say not painted especially black 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:16.159
 Atonekoko Kana It is painted part of the upper arm in 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:19.369
 That heavy-painted version is painted in gray, but also in the general sales this is painted 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.270
 It is that so feeling or day duty low training 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.920
 Here is a format but here is black 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:29.219
 It is such a feeling like painting The end is this part of the head 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:34.320
 The black dots here are omitted or something 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:39.630
 It seems like the part of the legislator like this kind of pipe is omitted. 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:44.070
 After Well described in the direction of the back which I a little but I have a difference in that is visible part 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.170
 The red is omitted in the part of the nursery lacquer in the back like this The heavy paint version is 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.729
 Well the other side is painted well 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:56.399
 After 9 minutes with my back, it 's black inside properly and on the side 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:59.650
 Although it has been removed , the general sales person has not become this Necro 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:04.660
 This is prima facie year general sales'm been painted in black 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:07.490
 But that heavy-painted version was a bit greyish 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:12.920
 Is this the is that it is a woman Do That Well 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.700
 A little gray metal It is painted in such a feeling color, and the color itself is completely different in this painting too 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.630
 I will 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:20.750
 The part of this silver pipe that looks like the latter 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:24.830
 Although this heavy painting version is already there 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.480
 The general sales are all small part and all the gold is painted in a lot 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:33.840
 Such a feeling that can be because it was only black part black 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:35.849
 After this, here is the red of this shoulder, this is already all over here, it's silver and it's solidly coated in the middle and its 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.500
 You are color-coded 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:41.340
 I explained when I saw from the side, but it is also easy to understand if I look from the back 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.920
 This 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.470
 The upper arm is painted in gray and there is a little sound tour in front of the general 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.820
 This too 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:55.720
 It doesn't go to gray, but it's not black . 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:03:01.300
 Next is the waist, but this difference in the belt is awesome 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:07.240
 Heavy painted version looks I feel it 's said the place where paint another tight is truly general 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.490
 If the seller has to open the sound of that child, it's painted, but to the other part Ginkgo goes into the room together 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.690
 What 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:16.700
 I think that people are working hard even this Hey, but I'm a I feel it 's it 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.480
 Possibility that it will become an all silver Peter without painting red when going at the level of the present painting 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.010
 There is 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.340
 It's a part of a star, but still 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:27.450
 It is gray when it says to flow 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:30.930
 It is the turn of the other arm, it's painted in silver here. 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:34.890
 It's a bit difficult to understand with the slight addition of light, but here it is 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:40.030
 All the general rice in white I'd have climbed God in silver 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:44.170
 It looks solid from the side, so it looks like it 's solid , and the arm has a partial gold in. 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:47.440
 All sugars are also column-painted and what is definitely different is the dengasher 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:52.000
 Even though I've been doing it the other heavy-painted version of kitchen 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:55.240
 If you're a general seller, it's like you're painting everything here by default. 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.020
 This is also true for the back of my belt 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:02.080
 Another in this state and in this way I go around to the back 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:06.410
 Since the middle and the side is firmly belt I'd have painted behind 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:09.470
 bar It is a feeling that it is hard to sell nothing but painting as it is . 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:13.730
 I Den of the reverse side is the feeling also that the same as person 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:18.410
 I'm painting on the house and I'm not painting anywhere 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:21.359
 Heavy paint version is also good par sales are almost the same I do not feel so big difference 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:27.270
 Quite unlike just it and go around to the back 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:28.379
 The heavy-painted version is this neat white border of the cat , and the part in the cat is also silver 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.860
 It is painted 

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:36.569
 If you are a general seller you are black here 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:39.599
 It feels like a close without painting 10 I came over version and general sales 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:41.350
 But once I compared the imagined home but still 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:47.010
 Do you say that 10 struggles are overdue 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:49.630
 From the feeling is if I front is when the general sales also turned back after all Kedomo I'm working hard is 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:52.070
 It is different to decisive 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:57.620
 If you put it back like this 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:05:01.040
 General sales have not caught up with the hard work of 10 painted cats 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:06.680
 Well though general sales do their best though 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:07.990
 So that is out working hard the atmosphere it in that small number of colors This is Naa between Well it is this 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.380
 I think but 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:15.760
 There are quite a few limited editions of the soft phone on the phone . 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:21.120
 I also want to introduce variously in the near future Kamen Rider Den-O Sword Form I 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.120
 It was the visiting version So let's meet again in the next video 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:25.939
 me 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.290
