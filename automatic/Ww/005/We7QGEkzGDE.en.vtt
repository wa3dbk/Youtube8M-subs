00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.090 

let's<00:00:02.340> talk<00:00:02.520> about<00:00:02.639> what<00:00:02.909> the<00:00:03.090> bus<00:00:04.100> this

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
let's talk about what the bus this

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.940 
let's talk about what the bus this
connection<00:00:05.850> it<00:00:06.540> continues<00:00:07.170> to<00:00:07.649> be<00:00:07.799> the

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
connection it continues to be the

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.669 
connection it continues to be the
strongest<00:00:08.429> element<00:00:08.940> of<00:00:09.059> design<00:00:09.450> today<00:00:09.750> why

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
strongest element of design today why

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.680 
strongest element of design today why
because<00:00:11.340> it<00:00:11.490> allows<00:00:11.790> us<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:12.120> create<00:00:12.450> the

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
because it allows us to create the

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.839 
because it allows us to create the
versatility<00:00:13.440> it<00:00:13.889> gives<00:00:14.190> us<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.460> sense<00:00:14.670> of

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
versatility it gives us a sense of

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.210 
versatility it gives us a sense of
looseness<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.839> gives<00:00:16.080> us<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.379> movement<00:00:16.890> the

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
looseness it gives us the movement the

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.150 
looseness it gives us the movement the
texture<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.510> volume<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.289> most
