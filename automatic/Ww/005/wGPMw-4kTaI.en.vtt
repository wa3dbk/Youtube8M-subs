00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
the speed change needs to be absolutely

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:49.430 
the speed change needs to be absolutely
the<00:00:40.230> last<00:00:40.410> footage<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:41.100> my<00:00:41.280> leg

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.420 

so<00:00:50.440> I<00:00:50.470> actually<00:00:50.860> got<00:00:51.460> up<00:00:51.610> the<00:00:52.150> courage<00:00:52.540> to<00:00:53.430> film

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
so I actually got up the courage to film

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.630 
so I actually got up the courage to film
myself<00:00:54.820> being<00:00:55.450> tattooed<00:00:55.750> this<00:00:56.200> time<00:00:56.640> the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
worst thing about being tattooed I think

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:09.120 
worst thing about being tattooed I think
is<00:00:59.350> the<00:00:59.650> noise
