thinner than a commando and that should

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.199 
thinner than a commando and that should
tell<00:02:38.890> us<00:02:38.920> that<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.340> commando<00:02:39.730> has<00:02:39.940> a<00:02:39.970> bigger

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
tell us that the commando has a bigger

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:41.729 
tell us that the commando has a bigger

make a big difference in longevity but

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.000 
make a big difference in longevity but
it's<00:02:51.700> something<00:02:52.030> worth<00:02:52.180> noting<00:02:52.709> to<00:02:53.709> round<00:02:53.890> out
