this to be careful that you don't want

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.810 
this to be careful that you don't want
the<00:03:59.260> water<00:03:59.440> to<00:03:59.620> be<00:03:59.920> bubbling<00:04:00.310> up<00:04:00.459> and<00:04:00.700> you

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
the water to be bubbling up and you

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.040 
the water to be bubbling up and you
don't<00:04:01.030> want<00:04:01.180> it<00:04:01.239> to<00:04:01.359> be<00:04:01.480> down<00:04:01.630> to<00:04:01.840> though<00:04:01.989> you

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
don't want it to be down to though you

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.140

want<00:04:02.349> it<00:04:02.410> to<00:04:02.500> be<00:04:02.620> perfect<00:04:02.650> and<00:04:03.550> that<00:04:03.700> is<00:04:03.879> the

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
want it to be perfect and that is the

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.000 
want it to be perfect and that is the
key<00:04:04.420> to<00:04:04.690> creating<00:04:05.379> the<00:04:05.650> right<00:04:05.680> consistency

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
key to creating the right consistency

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.900 
key to creating the right consistency
for<00:04:06.730> the

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
for the

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.820 
for the
and<00:04:07.210> then<00:04:07.660> you<00:04:07.810> just<00:04:08.020> kind<00:04:08.230> of<00:04:08.350> work<00:04:08.560> it<00:04:08.710> with

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
and then you just kind of work it with

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.770 
and then you just kind of work it with
your<00:04:08.950> fingers<00:04:09.370> until<00:04:09.670> you<00:04:10.060> get<00:04:10.210> it<00:04:10.300> all<00:04:10.480> mixed

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
your fingers until you get it all mixed

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.690 
your fingers until you get it all mixed
up<00:04:11.080> and<00:04:11.350> it<00:04:11.920> gets<00:04:12.100> nice<00:04:12.460> and<00:04:13.590> complete<00:04:14.590> so<00:04:14.980> I've

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
up and it gets nice and complete so I've

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.460 
up and it gets nice and complete so I've
got<00:04:15.910> obviously<00:04:16.360> way<00:04:16.510> too<00:04:16.540> much<00:04:16.840> water<00:04:17.049> here

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
got obviously way too much water here

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.670 
got obviously way too much water here
but<00:04:17.709> just<00:04:18.700> going<00:04:18.880> to<00:04:18.970> kind<00:04:19.180> of<00:04:19.269> try<00:04:19.450> to<00:04:19.480> get<00:04:19.720> the

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
but just going to kind of try to get the

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.170 
but just going to kind of try to get the
right<00:04:20.860> amount<00:04:21.010> of<00:04:21.310> water<00:04:22.530> put<00:04:23.530> that<00:04:23.680> in<00:04:23.860> there

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
right amount of water put that in there

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.810 
right amount of water put that in there
and<00:04:25.440> then<00:04:26.440> we'll<00:04:26.650> mix<00:04:27.010> it<00:04:27.160> up<00:04:27.280> here<00:04:27.520> and<00:04:27.610> see

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
and then we'll mix it up here and see

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:38.910 
and then we'll mix it up here and see
what<00:04:27.850> we<00:04:27.970> get

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.260 

and<00:04:39.520> you<00:04:39.670> do<00:04:39.850> want<00:04:40.060> to<00:04:40.210> try<00:04:40.450> to<00:04:41.670> get<00:04:42.670> all<00:04:42.970> the

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
and you do want to try to get all the

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.530 
and you do want to try to get all the
powder<00:04:44.050> mixed<00:04:44.620> in<00:04:44.740> with<00:04:44.890> this<00:04:45.130> of<00:04:45.340> course<00:04:45.540> it

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
powder mixed in with this of course it

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.870 
powder mixed in with this of course it
should<00:04:46.900> create<00:04:47.160> something<00:04:48.160> that's<00:04:48.370> got<00:04:48.820> a

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
should create something that's got a

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.910 
should create something that's got a
little<00:04:49.210> bit<00:04:49.540> if<00:04:49.780> you've<00:04:49.990> made<00:04:50.290> you<00:04:50.560> know<00:04:50.680> bread

little bit if you've made you know bread

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.380 
little bit if you've made you know bread
and<00:04:51.130> stuff<00:04:51.370> you'll<00:04:51.610> be<00:04:51.820> familiar<00:04:51.940> with<00:04:52.210> the

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
and stuff you'll be familiar with the

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.140 
and stuff you'll be familiar with the
consistency<00:04:52.720> of<00:04:53.140> it<00:04:53.440> it's<00:04:54.100> supposed<00:04:54.910> to<00:04:55.000> be

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
consistency of it it's supposed to be

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.760 
consistency of it it's supposed to be
kind<00:04:55.450> of<00:04:55.600> what<00:04:55.780> we<00:04:55.900> say<00:04:56.050> in<00:04:56.110> Japanese<00:04:56.290> passa
