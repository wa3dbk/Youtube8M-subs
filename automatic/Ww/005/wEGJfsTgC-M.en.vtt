Sierra Nevada torpedo it's that good for
60<00:05:31.190> minutes<00:05:32.020> it's<00:05:33.020> probably<00:05:33.590> I<00:05:33.770> think<00:05:34.730> it's

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
60 minutes it's probably I think it's

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.630 
60 minutes it's probably I think it's
better<00:05:35.120> than<00:05:35.360> the<00:05:35.540> 90<00:05:35.960> minutes<00:05:36.320> it's<00:05:37.250> a<00:05:37.370> little

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:37.640 
better than the 90 minutes it's a little

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.460 
better than the 90 minutes it's a little
bit<00:05:37.820> more<00:05:37.970> Placid<00:05:38.600> is<00:05:38.780> a<00:05:38.810> little<00:05:39.140> bit<00:05:39.260> more

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
bit more Placid is a little bit more

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.010 
bit more Placid is a little bit more
calm<00:05:40.060> you<00:05:41.060> could<00:05:41.240> probably<00:05:41.450> have<00:05:41.690> a<00:05:41.780> few

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
calm you could probably have a few

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.380 
calm you could probably have a few
bottles<00:05:42.370> whereas<00:05:43.370> I<00:05:43.490> think<00:05:43.520> with<00:05:43.820> a<00:05:43.880> 90<00:05:44.270> minute

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:44.390 
bottles whereas I think with a 90 minute

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:49.390 
bottles whereas I think with a 90 minute
it's<00:05:44.720> a<00:05:45.170> woman<00:05:45.950> bottle<00:05:48.010> drink<00:05:49.010> I<00:05:49.100> don't<00:05:49.160> think
