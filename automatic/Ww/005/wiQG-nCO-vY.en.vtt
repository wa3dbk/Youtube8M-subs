00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
there we're going to arm go layer new

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.490 
there we're going to arm go layer new
and<00:01:33.390> we're<00:01:33.509> going<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.659> create<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.960> solid<00:01:34.170> a

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
solid is going to be act as our

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.080 
solid is going to be act as our
background<00:01:36.390> make<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.290> comp<00:01:37.560> sighs<00:01:38.090> that's

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
background make that comp sighs that's

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.999 
background make that comp sighs that's
solid

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
solid

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.100 
solid
why<00:01:41.009> I'm<00:01:41.400> going<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.640> make<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:41.939> white<00:01:42.150> okay

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
why I'm going to make it white okay

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.810 
why I'm going to make it white okay
white<00:01:43.530> solid<00:01:43.920> let's<00:01:44.250> change<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.610> name<00:01:44.790> of

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
white solid let's change the name of

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.700 
white solid let's change the name of
that<00:01:44.939> just<00:01:45.360> click<00:01:45.750> on<00:01:46.020> there<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.560> make<00:01:46.680> sure

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
that just click on there to make sure

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.980 
that just click on there to make sure
it's<00:01:47.040> highlighted<00:01:47.520> click<00:01:47.909> return<00:01:48.390> or<00:01:48.659> enter

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
it's highlighted click return or enter

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.060 
it's highlighted click return or enter
then<00:01:49.770> we're<00:01:50.369> going<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.579> call<00:01:50.729> this<00:01:50.909> back

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
then we're going to call this back

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.149 
then we're going to call this back
ground<00:01:53.509> it's<00:01:54.509> going<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.720> be<00:01:54.780> our<00:01:54.869> background

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
ground it's going to be our background

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:03.200 
ground it's going to be our background
look<00:01:56.159> it's<00:01:57.149> not<00:01:57.329> useful<00:01:57.509> life<00:01:59.450> back<00:02:00.710> ground<00:02:02.210> so

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
look it's not useful life back ground so

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.880 
look it's not useful life back ground so
our<00:02:03.329> background<00:02:03.780> layer<00:02:03.990> so<00:02:04.170> now<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.680> we<00:02:04.799> have

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
our background layer so now that we have

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.240 
our background layer so now that we have
a<00:02:04.920> background<00:02:05.369> layer<00:02:05.549> let's<00:02:05.820> add<00:02:06.030> some<00:02:06.780> text

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
a background layer let's add some text

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.800 
a background layer let's add some text
that's<00:02:08.250> our<00:02:08.489> first<00:02:08.670> asset<00:02:09.030> our<00:02:09.330> background

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
that's our first asset our background

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.050 
that's our first asset our background
layer<00:02:09.869> now<00:02:10.110> we're<00:02:10.229> going<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.410> add<00:02:10.560> some<00:02:10.830> text

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
layer now we're going to add some text

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.250 
layer now we're going to add some text
so<00:02:12.060> let's

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
so let's

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:23.860 
so let's
say<00:02:13.830> a<00:02:18.110> dub<00:02:20.420> productions<00:02:21.440> okay<00:02:22.440> that<00:02:23.280> is<00:02:23.549> our

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
say a dub productions okay that is our

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.809 
say a dub productions okay that is our
text<00:02:24.870> layer<00:02:24.930> that's<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.830> layer<00:02:26.069> that<00:02:26.310> we<00:02:26.580> are

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
text layer that's the layer that we are

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.589 
text layer that's the layer that we are
going<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.450> cast<00:02:28.319> shadows<00:02:28.530> on<00:02:29.099> now<00:02:29.670> what<00:02:30.450> we

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
going to cast shadows on now what we

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.320 
going to cast shadows on now what we
have<00:02:30.629> right<00:02:31.080> here<00:02:31.110> is<00:02:31.500> two<00:02:31.980> flat<00:02:32.610> layers<00:02:32.970> two

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
have right here is two flat layers two

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.880 
have right here is two flat layers two
layers<00:02:33.599> laying<00:02:33.900> on<00:02:34.080> top<00:02:34.110> of<00:02:34.290> each<00:02:34.470> other<00:02:34.620> you

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
layers laying on top of each other you

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.820 
layers laying on top of each other you
cannot<00:02:35.390> cast<00:02:36.390> shadows<00:02:36.930> against<00:02:37.440> two<00:02:37.590> things

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
cannot cast shadows against two things

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.500 
cannot cast shadows against two things
that<00:02:37.980> are<00:02:38.069> pressed<00:02:38.280> up<00:02:38.459> into<00:02:38.940> each<00:02:39.030> other<00:02:39.239> you

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
that are pressed up into each other you

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.350 
that are pressed up into each other you
have<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.920> create<00:02:40.920> an<00:02:41.129> open<00:02:41.610> space<00:02:41.879> in<00:02:42.180> between

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
have to create an open space in between

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.470 
have to create an open space in between
so<00:02:42.870> that<00:02:43.640> thing<00:02:44.640> you're<00:02:44.819> trying<00:02:45.150> to<00:02:45.239> project

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
so that thing you're trying to project

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.020 
so that thing you're trying to project
the<00:02:46.049> shadow<00:02:46.670> off<00:02:47.670> of<00:02:49.220> well<00:02:50.220> in<00:02:50.489> our<00:02:50.670> case<00:02:50.849> the

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
the shadow off of well in our case the

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.569 
the shadow off of well in our case the
text<00:02:51.239> layer<00:02:51.569> has<00:02:51.840> to<00:02:51.989> be<00:02:52.109> separated<00:02:52.739> from<00:02:52.950> the

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
text layer has to be separated from the

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:54.770 
text layer has to be separated from the
background<00:02:53.760> layer<00:02:54.180> so<00:02:54.239> what<00:02:54.510> we're<00:02:54.629> going<00:02:54.750> to

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
background layer so what we're going to

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.250 
background layer so what we're going to
do<00:02:54.959> is<00:02:55.079> we're<00:02:55.260> going<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:55.410> make<00:02:56.099> both<00:02:56.310> layers<00:02:56.609> 3d

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
do is we're going to make both layers 3d

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.470 
do is we're going to make both layers 3d
so<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.920> just<00:02:59.160> made<00:02:59.340> our<00:02:59.489> texture<00:02:59.970> 3d<00:03:00.329> by

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
so it just made our texture 3d by

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.699 
so it just made our texture 3d by
hitting<00:03:00.660> that<00:03:00.750> square<00:03:01.140> now<00:03:01.379> we're<00:03:01.560> going<00:03:01.650> to

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
hitting that square now we're going to

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.430 
hitting that square now we're going to
make<00:03:02.010> our<00:03:02.160> background<00:03:02.549> layer<00:03:02.640> 3d<00:03:03.599> also<00:03:04.170> and

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
make our background layer 3d also and

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.670 
make our background layer 3d also and
just<00:03:05.280> just<00:03:05.940> check<00:03:06.239> that<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:06.750> show<00:03:07.470> you<00:03:07.530> what

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
just just check that to show you what

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.330 
just just check that to show you what
I'm<00:03:07.769> talking<00:03:07.799> about

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
I'm talking about

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.190 
I'm talking about
we're<00:03:08.940> going<00:03:09.060> to<00:03:09.120> change<00:03:09.390> it<00:03:09.569> from<00:03:09.599> active

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
we're going to change it from active

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.699 
we're going to change it from active
camera<00:03:10.620> view<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.489> top<00:03:11.730> of<00:03:12.049> the<00:03:13.049> of<00:03:13.560> the

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
camera view to the top of the of the

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.870 
camera view to the top of the of the
layers<00:03:14.150> now<00:03:15.150> you<00:03:15.209> can<00:03:15.510> see<00:03:15.720> both<00:03:15.750> layers<00:03:16.500> are

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
layers now you can see both layers are

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.430 
layers now you can see both layers are
flat<00:03:17.880> against<00:03:18.359> each<00:03:18.450> other<00:03:18.630> like<00:03:18.810> I<00:03:18.930> said<00:03:19.169> so

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
flat against each other like I said so

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.259 
flat against each other like I said so
you're<00:03:19.590> going<00:03:19.739> to<00:03:19.799> arm<00:03:20.010> you<00:03:20.730> know<00:03:20.880> make<00:03:21.090> sure

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
you're going to arm you know make sure

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.020 
you're going to arm you know make sure
the<00:03:21.389> text<00:03:21.690> layer<00:03:21.840> is<00:03:21.989> highlighted<00:03:22.500> and<00:03:22.680> in<00:03:23.400> z

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
the text layer is highlighted and in z

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.089 
the text layer is highlighted and in z
space<00:03:24.060> you're<00:03:24.599> going<00:03:24.630> to<00:03:24.810> move<00:03:25.049> the<00:03:25.709> text

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
space you're going to move the text

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.270 
space you're going to move the text
layer<00:03:26.400> forward<00:03:27.139> okay<00:03:28.139> so<00:03:28.200> now<00:03:28.680> you<00:03:28.739> see<00:03:29.130> we

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
layer forward okay so now you see we

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.949 
layer forward okay so now you see we
have<00:03:29.310> space<00:03:29.730> between<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:30.389> background<00:03:30.810> layer

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
have space between the background layer

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.659 
have space between the background layer
which<00:03:31.169> is<00:03:31.319> right<00:03:31.500> here<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:32.099> it's<00:03:32.250> Exeter

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:32.669 
which is right here and it's Exeter

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:34.879 
which is right here and it's Exeter
click<00:03:33.450> on<00:03:33.569> the<00:03:33.690> background<00:03:33.870> layer<00:03:34.260> and<00:03:34.470> you

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
click on the background layer and you

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:36.379 
click on the background layer and you
can<00:03:35.040> see<00:03:35.280> that<00:03:35.459> that<00:03:35.669> layer<00:03:36.150> in<00:03:36.299> the

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:36.389 
can see that that layer in the

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:38.360 
can see that that layer in the
background<00:03:36.840> in<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.620> back<00:03:37.829> is<00:03:38.069> the<00:03:38.190> background

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
background in the back is the background

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.120 
background in the back is the background
layer<00:03:38.700> so<00:03:38.970> move<00:03:39.660> that<00:03:39.930> in<00:03:40.290> z<00:03:40.560> space<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:40.919> same

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
layer so move that in z space the same

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.509 
layer so move that in z space the same
way<00:03:41.480> or<00:03:42.480> text<00:03:43.200> layer<00:03:43.500> so<00:03:43.769> our<00:03:44.160> text<00:03:44.430> layer

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
way or text layer so our text layer

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.659 
way or text layer so our text layer
should<00:03:44.910> be<00:03:45.000> in<00:03:45.209> front<00:03:45.569> of<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:46.669> background

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
should be in front of the background

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.849 
should be in front of the background
layer<00:03:48.000> now<00:03:48.269> so<00:03:48.660> let's<00:03:48.900> toggle<00:03:49.109> back<00:03:49.410> to<00:03:49.560> active

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
layer now so let's toggle back to active

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.710 
layer now so let's toggle back to active
camera<00:03:50.220> and<00:03:50.430> we're<00:03:51.150> going<00:03:51.269> to<00:03:51.329> see<00:03:51.510> what<00:03:51.630> we

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
camera and we're going to see what we

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.990 
camera and we're going to see what we
have<00:03:51.840> this<00:03:52.019> is<00:03:52.139> what<00:03:52.169> we<00:03:52.349> have<00:03:52.500> so<00:03:53.069> next<00:03:53.819> step

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
have this is what we have so next step

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.129 
have this is what we have so next step
you<00:03:54.150> need<00:03:54.269> three<00:03:54.540> things<00:03:54.780> you<00:03:54.959> need<00:03:55.109> a

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
you need three things you need a

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:58.430 
you need three things you need a
background<00:03:55.709> you<00:03:56.250> need<00:03:56.459> a<00:03:56.870> object<00:03:57.870> which<00:03:58.319> is

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
background you need a object which is

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.530 
background you need a object which is
our<00:03:58.590> text<00:03:58.980> and<00:03:59.190> you<00:03:59.280> need<00:03:59.459> a<00:03:59.489> light<00:03:59.790> so<00:04:00.510> let's

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
our text and you need a light so let's

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.750 
our text and you need a light so let's
go<00:04:00.989> to<00:04:01.709> layer<00:04:02.609> new<00:04:02.879> and<00:04:03.750> create<00:04:04.440> a<00:04:04.500> light<00:04:04.760> on

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
go to layer new and create a light on

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.369

going to do now my computer is kind of

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.050 
going to do now my computer is kind of
acting<00:04:35.070> kind<00:04:35.220> of<00:04:35.310> slow<00:04:35.490> right<00:04:35.610> now<00:04:35.790> I<00:04:35.820> got<00:04:35.970> to

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
acting kind of slow right now I got to

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.700 
acting kind of slow right now I got to
erase<00:04:36.240> some<00:04:36.420> stuff<00:04:36.450> what<00:04:37.290> we're<00:04:37.410> going<00:04:37.530> to<00:04:37.560> do

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
erase some stuff what we're going to do

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.340 
erase some stuff what we're going to do
now<00:04:37.860> is<00:04:38.010> we're<00:04:38.130> going<00:04:38.220> to<00:04:38.310> go<00:04:38.460> to<00:04:38.520> the<00:04:38.730> light

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
now is we're going to go to the light

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.960 
now is we're going to go to the light
layer<00:04:40.350> because<00:04:41.190> this<00:04:41.220> doesn't<00:04:41.790> look<00:04:41.910> like

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
layer because this doesn't look like

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.770 
layer because this doesn't look like
it's<00:04:42.780> too<00:04:43.230> sharp<00:04:43.530> the<00:04:43.770> edges<00:04:43.800> of<00:04:44.340> the<00:04:44.520> cone<00:04:45.000> is

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
it's too sharp the edges of the cone is

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.630 
it's too sharp the edges of the cone is
too<00:04:46.050> sharp<00:04:46.290> so<00:04:46.620> we're<00:04:46.770> going<00:04:46.860> to<00:04:46.950> arm<00:04:47.160> toggle

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
too sharp so we're going to arm toggle

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.330 
too sharp so we're going to arm toggle
the<00:04:48.510> options<00:04:49.410> down<00:04:49.590> and<00:04:49.830> the<00:04:49.920> light<00:04:50.100> layer

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
the options down and the light layer

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.670 
the options down and the light layer
then<00:04:50.910> go<00:04:50.940> to<00:04:51.120> light<00:04:51.330> options<00:04:51.780> and<00:04:52.020> you're

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
then go to light options and you're

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.470 
then go to light options and you're
going<00:04:52.830> to<00:04:52.890> go<00:04:52.980> to<00:04:53.010> Cohen<00:04:53.310> feather<00:04:53.700> we're<00:04:54.360> going

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
going to go to Cohen feather we're going

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.880 
going to go to Cohen feather we're going
to<00:04:54.540> feather<00:04:54.750> out<00:04:54.870> this<00:04:55.080> cone<00:04:55.290> a<00:04:55.320> little<00:04:55.620> bit<00:04:55.770> to

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
to feather out this cone a little bit to

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.100 
to feather out this cone a little bit to
make<00:04:56.010> it<00:04:56.130> look<00:04:56.250> a<00:04:56.310> little<00:04:56.430> more<00:04:56.580> realistic<00:04:57.110> you

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
make it look a little more realistic you

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.200 
make it look a little more realistic you
see<00:04:58.290> now<00:04:58.650> you<00:04:59.070> get<00:04:59.250> a<00:04:59.280> little<00:04:59.520> little<00:04:59.850> Hades

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
see now you get a little little Hades

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.880 
see now you get a little little Hades
effect<00:05:00.510> right<00:05:00.690> there<00:05:00.750> that<00:05:01.500> looks<00:05:01.650> a<00:05:01.800> little

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
effect right there that looks a little

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.790 
effect right there that looks a little
more<00:05:02.160> realistic<00:05:02.310> right<00:05:02.820> there<00:05:03.030> so<00:05:03.330> um<00:05:03.630> you<00:05:04.590> got

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
more realistic right there so um you got

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.300 
more realistic right there so um you got
that<00:05:05.070> down<00:05:05.780> the<00:05:06.780> second<00:05:07.230> thing<00:05:07.410> that<00:05:07.620> you<00:05:07.980> want

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
that down the second thing that you want

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.690 
that down the second thing that you want
to<00:05:08.400> do<00:05:08.610> is<00:05:09.169> you<00:05:10.169> want<00:05:10.350> to<00:05:10.410> go<00:05:10.560> to<00:05:10.620> our<00:05:11.130> text

to do is you want to go to our text

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.320 
to do is you want to go to our text
layer<00:05:11.880> or<00:05:12.210> the<00:05:12.270> layer<00:05:12.780> that<00:05:13.560> you<00:05:14.300> of<00:05:15.300> the

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
layer or the layer that you of the

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.560 
layer or the layer that you of the
object<00:05:15.810> that<00:05:15.900> you're<00:05:16.050> trying<00:05:16.320> to<00:05:17.390> cast<00:05:18.390> the

object that you're trying to cast the
shadows<00:05:18.870> off<00:05:19.020> of<00:05:19.200> so<00:05:19.770> material<00:05:20.669> options<00:05:21.090> which

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
shadows off of so material options which

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.000 
shadows off of so material options which
start<00:05:21.780> text<00:05:22.050> layer<00:05:22.169> so<00:05:22.380> you<00:05:22.410> go<00:05:22.650> to<00:05:22.710> the<00:05:22.830> text

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
start text layer so you go to the text

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.670 
start text layer so you go to the text
layer<00:05:23.160> you<00:05:23.580> toggle<00:05:23.940> down<00:05:24.230> material<00:05:25.230> options

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
layer you toggle down material options

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.390 
layer you toggle down material options
and<00:05:25.890> then<00:05:26.430> you<00:05:26.790> want<00:05:27.030> to<00:05:27.800> make<00:05:28.800> that<00:05:29.010> layer

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
and then you want to make that layer

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.090 
and then you want to make that layer
except<00:05:30.000> shadows<00:05:30.570> so<00:05:31.169> where<00:05:31.560> it<00:05:31.650> says<00:05:31.680> cast

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
except shadows so where it says cast

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.210 
except shadows so where it says cast
shadows<00:05:32.520> you<00:05:32.760> want<00:05:32.910> to<00:05:33.000> turn<00:05:33.210> that<00:05:33.450> on<00:05:34.220> okay

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
shadows you want to turn that on okay

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.969 
shadows you want to turn that on okay
now<00:05:35.430> when<00:05:36.360> you<00:05:36.390> turn<00:05:36.600> that<00:05:36.810> on<00:05:37.020> now<00:05:37.620> you<00:05:37.680> see

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
now when you turn that on now you see

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:42.530 
now when you turn that on now you see
our<00:05:38.100> shadows<00:05:39.380> and<00:05:40.910> that's<00:05:41.910> basically<00:05:42.300> how<00:05:42.479> you

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:42.540 
our shadows and that's basically how you

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:43.070 
our shadows and that's basically how you
do<00:05:42.780> it

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
do it

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
do it

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 
see um you have the shadows in the

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.690 
see um you have the shadows in the
background

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 
background

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:53.150 
background
um<00:05:48.440> shadows<00:05:49.440> of<00:05:49.800> what<00:05:50.729> we<00:05:51.419> of<00:05:52.200> our<00:05:52.800> text<00:05:53.100> layer

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 
um shadows of what we of our text layer

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.640 
um shadows of what we of our text layer
on<00:05:53.669> that<00:05:53.910> background<00:05:54.120> now<00:05:55.050> it<00:05:55.200> looks<00:05:55.350> kind<00:05:55.590> of

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
on that background now it looks kind of

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.159 
on that background now it looks kind of
crappy<00:05:55.860> but<00:05:56.070> that's<00:05:56.640> basically<00:05:57.090> all<00:05:57.390> you<00:05:57.990> need
