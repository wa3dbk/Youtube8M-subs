00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.940
 for that reason he has urged on singing river 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.620
 the most important thing to do is what 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.740
 first thing to do is hold 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:14.380
 well the piece to a press either a 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:18.340
 pressure and the text the bank press what 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:20.260
 next is the initial end where 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.850
 let's make the plating we're going to 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.280
 place 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.970
 this element in this way 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.750
 let us stay 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.750
 flush 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:35.590
 with the surface of the board where 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.590
 Let's sing 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.880
 we push 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.780
 this in order to be able to hold the 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.170
 singing at the beginning 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.789
 of this piece of aluminum so that this 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.949
 do not slip do not slide when 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:58.570
 we are working with the machine this 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.420
 we can use it with this element 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.710
 which is included with the machine or 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.710
 also with a 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.119
 man alone for better firmness and 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.590
 greater support and also for greater 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.860
 ease and speed in releasing the 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.470
 field 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.650
 once we have located this we are going to 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.280
 put the piece on the press 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:26.280
 fixing the good 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.280
 use 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.829
 Next step is that of singing 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:38.000
 the pro how much are we going to take the 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:40.970
 we're going to sing and we're going to 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.280
 trim the singing strip 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:47.770
 in this case we are going to leave you also 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:50.740
 until the beginning of the surface and 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.570
 adding the 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.770
 centimeters that has the dilated the 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.770
 bra in the form of him 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.060
 we take our singing bagger 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.100
 tickets 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.479
 by the top on the roller in 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.330
 the top part is where the 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:11.630
 flexible singing or mÃ£ singing and in the 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.239
 bottom is where the singing will go 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:19.420
 rigid both of 2 millimeters and by the 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:19.420
 which we are going to insert the edge strip 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.030
 we insert our song and with this 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.260
 element 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.790
 we are going to do to press without that 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.610
 firmly his gesture but if he has a 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.160
 free passage simply in order to 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.680
 keep us from moving the change 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.300
 of the process of plugged in with these 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.380
 elements with these tools the 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:50.660
 we will release to open or close the 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.730
 sheet metal jaws now you're 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.230
 jaws should go according to size 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.349
 of the board that we are going to plug 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.819
 not that we will be very pressured 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.940
 but not that we will be very 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:06.599
 I loose the width of the on the board 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.540
 just go guiding the machine 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:12.580
 on the board that we are going to plug 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:15.340
 let's make the song come out 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:18.100
 and this part the beginning of this part is 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.740
 what are we going to do to put the 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.440
 bra 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.060
 at the beginning of the bra 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.010
 and we are going to graduate the jaws 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.740
 simply 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.990
 let's say the knob 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.080
 the desired width of the board that we are going to 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.080
 puff up 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:38.019
 leaving him free and we can fix them with 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.019
 those top screws 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.970
 We brought the machine to the start 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.750
 and we hold it 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:54.670
 Firstly 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.670
 to prevent them from moving 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.770
 next 163 then let's tilt 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.770
 a little the machines 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.310
 we plug into the current and turn on 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:16.519
 machine 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.820
 of value from front to back of the 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:24.780
 piece 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.780
 doing an injury in the bottom 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:42.869
 all three surfaces are covered 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:46.460
 two
