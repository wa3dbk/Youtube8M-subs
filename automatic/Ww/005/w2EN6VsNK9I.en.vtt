lot of fat elsewhere on the body so that

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.290 
lot of fat elsewhere on the body so that
this<00:00:25.320> is<00:00:25.560> really<00:00:26.099> what<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.519> most<00:00:26.880> noticeable

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
go away and every time I get this

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.380 
go away and every time I get this

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
that the body becomes in a much more

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.660 
that the body becomes in a much more
delicate<00:01:37.860> position

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
delicate position

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.670 
delicate position
actually<00:01:39.329> I've<00:01:39.540> said<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.140> before<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.530> think

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
actually I've said this before I think

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.830 
actually I've said this before I think
people<00:01:41.130> are<00:01:41.220> much<00:01:41.400> who<00:01:41.759> were<00:01:41.880> very<00:01:42.329> glow<00:01:42.689> and

body<00:01:42.990> fat<00:01:43.170> extremely<00:01:43.829> low<00:01:43.979> are<00:01:44.509> relatively

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
body fat extremely low are relatively

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.560 
body fat extremely low are relatively
susceptible<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.520> illness<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:48.090> they<00:01:48.240> weren't

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
susceptible to illness that they weren't

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.280 
susceptible to illness that they weren't
they<00:01:49.049> had<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.350> little<00:01:49.710> bit<00:01:49.920> more<00:01:51.079> weight<00:01:52.079> on

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290

how<00:02:27.190> can<00:02:28.060> we<00:02:28.300> do<00:02:28.840> something<00:02:29.230> about<00:02:29.470> that<00:02:29.890> how

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
how can we do something about that how

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.770 
how can we do something about that how
can<00:02:30.100> we<00:02:30.250> do<00:02:30.430> anything<00:02:30.460> about<00:02:30.910> that<00:02:31.240> well

actually<00:02:32.050> you<00:02:32.290> might<00:02:32.410> want<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.680> think<00:02:32.830> about

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
actually you might want to think about

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.640 
actually you might want to think about
something<00:02:33.730> that<00:02:34.390> is<00:02:34.570> the<00:02:34.720> reverse<00:02:35.260> of<00:02:35.560> what

something that is the reverse of what

something that is the reverse of what
you've<00:02:36.040> been<00:02:36.220> doing<00:02:36.490> you<00:02:36.580> might<00:02:36.730> want<00:02:36.940> to

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
you've been doing you might want to

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.260 
you've been doing you might want to
think<00:02:37.090> about<00:02:37.980> increasing<00:02:38.980> your<00:02:39.340> food<00:02:39.790> intake

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
when we are not getting enough of them

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.080 
when we are not getting enough of them
right<00:02:50.950> if<00:02:51.130> we're<00:02:51.250> not<00:02:51.340> getting<00:02:51.670> enough

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
right if we're not getting enough

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.229 
right if we're not getting enough
calories<00:02:53.010> suddenly<00:02:54.010> everything<00:02:54.610> slows<00:02:54.970> down

the metabolism slows down to protect us

the metabolism slows down to protect us

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
and support us because it actually

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.380 
and support us because it actually
thinks<00:02:59.110> we're<00:02:59.260> starving<00:02:59.860> so<00:03:00.459> what<00:03:01.120> I<00:03:01.150> would

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
thinks we're starving so what I would

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
mean as compared to diet down you've

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.470 
mean as compared to diet down you've
already<00:03:08.080> done<00:03:08.380> all<00:03:08.590> that<00:03:08.620> work<00:03:08.980> and<00:03:09.480> there's

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
already done all that work and there's

some there's a risk of sacrificing the
rest<00:03:14.680> of<00:03:14.890> your<00:03:15.070> size<00:03:15.310> and<00:03:16.300> muscle<00:03:16.980> just<00:03:17.980> to<00:03:18.100> dig

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
rest of your size and muscle just to dig

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.250 
rest of your size and muscle just to dig
it<00:03:18.400> this<00:03:18.549> one<00:03:18.730> little<00:03:19.030> piece<00:03:19.209> right<00:03:19.420> and<00:03:19.780> maybe

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
it this one little piece right and maybe

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.229 
it this one little piece right and maybe
it's<00:03:20.530> actually<00:03:20.799> more<00:03:21.160> noticeable<00:03:21.790> to<00:03:21.940> you

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
it's actually more noticeable to you

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.810 
it's actually more noticeable to you
than<00:03:22.720> it<00:03:22.840> is<00:03:22.989> to<00:03:23.350> other<00:03:23.500> people<00:03:24.040> as<00:03:24.190> well<00:03:24.400> right

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
than it is to other people as well right

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.009 
than it is to other people as well right
because<00:03:25.060> you've<00:03:25.209> already<00:03:25.390> done<00:03:25.630> quite<00:03:25.900> a<00:03:25.930> bit

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
because you've already done quite a bit

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:31.410 
because you've already done quite a bit
of<00:03:26.230> work<00:03:26.380> so<00:03:27.600> try<00:03:28.600> to<00:03:28.660> focus<00:03:28.900> on<00:03:29.700> getting<00:03:30.700> more

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
of work so try to focus on getting more

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.690 
of work so try to focus on getting more
calories<00:03:31.959> into<00:03:32.230> the<00:03:32.350> body<00:03:32.560> little<00:03:33.160> by<00:03:33.280> little

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
calories into the body little by little

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.539 
calories into the body little by little
by<00:03:33.880> little<00:03:34.090> and<00:03:34.269> see<00:03:34.450> if<00:03:34.540> that<00:03:34.720> actually<00:03:34.959> makes

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
by little and see if that actually makes

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.699 
by little and see if that actually makes
more<00:03:36.549> sense<00:03:36.880> if<00:03:37.090> your<00:03:37.209> body<00:03:37.420> tends<00:03:37.810> to<00:03:38.110> not<00:03:38.500> be

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
more sense if your body tends to not be

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.340 
more sense if your body tends to not be
afraid<00:03:38.860> of<00:03:39.690> getting<00:03:40.690> rid<00:03:40.840> of<00:03:40.870> things<00:03:41.080> because

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
afraid of getting rid of things because

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.720 
afraid of getting rid of things because
it<00:03:41.590> feels<00:03:41.799> like<00:03:41.920> it<00:03:42.100> has<00:03:42.250> an<00:03:42.400> ample<00:03:42.700> supply

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
it feels like it has an ample supply

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.360 
it feels like it has an ample supply
coming<00:03:43.570> from<00:03:43.900> somewhere<00:03:44.320> else<00:03:44.380> I<00:03:44.799> hope<00:03:45.190> that

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
coming from somewhere else I hope that

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.479 
coming from somewhere else I hope that
makes<00:03:45.519> some<00:03:45.730> sense<00:03:45.880> to<00:03:46.060> you<00:03:46.239> so<00:03:46.920> I<00:03:47.920> wish<00:03:48.370> you

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
makes some sense to you so I wish you
