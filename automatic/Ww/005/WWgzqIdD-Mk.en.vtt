activated<00:02:03.180> charcoal<00:02:03.479> does<00:02:03.659> not<00:02:03.810> mix<00:02:04.020> well

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
activated charcoal does not mix well

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.090 
activated charcoal does not mix well
with<00:02:04.350> honey<00:02:04.560> for<00:02:04.649> some<00:02:04.950> reason

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
with honey for some reason

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.550 
with honey for some reason
so<00:02:06.580> here's<00:02:06.880> my<00:02:07.030> honey<00:02:07.270> I<00:02:07.480> just<00:02:07.690> put<00:02:07.900> probably

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
so here's my honey I just put probably

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.620 
so here's my honey I just put probably
around<00:02:09.039> a<00:02:09.130> teaspoon<00:02:09.610> maybe<00:02:09.789> less<00:02:10.149> into<00:02:10.539> the

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
around a teaspoon maybe less into the

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.750 
around a teaspoon maybe less into the
bottom<00:02:10.929> of<00:02:10.960> just<00:02:11.800> a<00:02:11.890> measuring<00:02:12.280> cup<00:02:12.460> so<00:02:12.700> it

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
bottom of just a measuring cup so it

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.910 
bottom of just a measuring cup so it
would<00:02:12.850> be<00:02:12.970> easy<00:02:13.150> to<00:02:13.390> mix<00:02:13.540> them<00:02:13.780> and<00:02:13.990> then<00:02:14.830> I'm

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
would be easy to mix them and then I'm

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.530 
would be easy to mix them and then I'm
going<00:02:15.040> to<00:02:15.130> take<00:02:15.250> like<00:02:15.400> a<00:02:15.460> quarter<00:02:16.390> of<00:02:16.480> a
