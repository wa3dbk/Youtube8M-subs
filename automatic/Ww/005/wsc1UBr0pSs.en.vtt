00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.720
 welcome to a new video must host Jalloh 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.499
 and I want you in this video a simple technique 

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:09.929
 imagine 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.110
 we just have parallel sounds but the chords 

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:15.369
 to do a certain thing 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:17.929
 you can enter for example 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:20.789
 Pelzer Modern piano piece 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.869
 To harmonize these or to harmonize occasion a v-man relate 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.649
 a bit more flexible than being able to be more flexible 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:31.969
 in the selection in the cord, for example, if the 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:33.890
 collection 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.670
 want to play on the 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.200
 which never broadcast on the radio 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.180
 Rohde on cd &amp; r said i would like this one 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.010
 this one on 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.970
 but at least we play bad luck for the chords Hausen 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:47.490
 continue 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.320
 And to that will look at this video to give FIFA a statement 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.480
 we find the appropriate chords for a song 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.730
 Yes, and the Kremlin helps us to move in 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.730
 Topic many of you hear know this and 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.720
 so this year 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.470
 That's right, as well as I was at least that's the then intelligent I 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.290
 had to memorize and 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.290
 At that time, percentages had all omens and so on and so forth 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.909
 around these limits 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.440
 Now finally had a wealth of information 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.840
 but I do not want to go into that 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.740
 it's primarily about it 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.500
 quite simply to find in the palace coach to do the respective ones and 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.980
 served to zipple very well 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.080
 we can see here above 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.870
 from the work e on 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:40.180
 at 10 o'clock it has a parallel molto daffodils year and every tour key 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.830
 has a parallels Bolton Art 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.600
 one could go to district to Thorsten had Brawn 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.140
 that's very important so every button has a parallel minor does 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.550
 these are residents of Staiger below gates' on the keyboard after par 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.100
 three semitones lower 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.670
 Tina from f to dissent also three semitones and so on 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.859
 but also here is Mold of Art 

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:08.429
 has a parallel 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.059
 Doerr key 

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.999
 and they are 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:13.689
 and the lights accordingly 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:15.559
 at three semitones higher 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:18.679
 that has these engines 

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:22.229
 yes and accordingly, of course, in the sign of change 

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:25.179
 but I do not want to take any of these keys like Cindy 

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:27.549
 but it's just about relationships 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.729
 after a key 

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:33.279
 around chords 

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:37.040
 to be able to find and just about possible and apparently simply around the 

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.949
 selection 

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:40.829
 the choir to expand can not use 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.049
 to harmonize a game 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.599
 permanently this parallel to also had representative sounds 

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:50.169
 that means I can 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:52.559
 for example, in one piece 

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:56.859
 that is 10 o'clock or a piece in which the choir in C major appears 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:59.589
 Just play in the morning 

00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:01.219
 that usually always 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:04.339
 according to a format as always play 

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:06.790
 vice versa as well as Arnold 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.320
 paint or draw cords on Monday 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.010
 Financable Corden so far then just to look at these belong together 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.010
 these chords have content to do 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:21.099
 Well, as a rule that is quite different but it fits and that's what it's about now 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.189
 just have a bit more choice around ours 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:27.749
 to harmonize our pieces or if I am now a piece for more 

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:31.209
 Listening wants to gamble from 10g real tomatoes 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.279
 there comes the 4 subcompanies but I am this technique 

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:36.759
 all around 

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:38.140
 it is like that 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.829
 that we 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:43.310
 May of a reason could have spoken to us a bottom line 

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:47.309
 Pests levels 1 4 and 5 that is when this piece will go 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:50.150
 Becker we so easy way 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.589
 in c major 

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:53.479
 the fourth stage from to e 

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:54.959
 he would drive 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.789
 and the fifth level 

00:03:56.789 --> 00:04:00.179
 from the toes would be G major that is this 3 

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:01.749
 up here 

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:05.680
 I can make a foundation for learning within this piece 

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:07.119
 these 

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:08.899
 Acorda occur 

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:10.739
 you the respective ones 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:11.960
 parallel of Art 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.499
 use 

00:04:13.499 --> 00:04:16.469
 yes, if there is a piece for example 

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:17.790
 which is in C major 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.090
 gets on the Main Kiel clock ago "You can not at the repetition maybe 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.849
 a stanza of a chorus 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:25.659
 did not rise at this point 

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:28.099
 according to TF 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:31.629
 creativity is also in demand Zermatter tests 

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:35.099
 the matching rule of all unknown very fast percent a bit very 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:37.759
 harmonize beautiful occasion and then you go 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:41.349
 OKI that was heard I am Said al and now percent in the next part of 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:43.259
 videos 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:45.550
 Who do you get that piano? 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.550
 demonstrate 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:00.849
 Yahoo 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:02.330
 yes with no 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.949
 we have now looked around missing him 

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:09.809
 powerful once is practically implement 

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:11.909
 and so the amphibians 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:15.490
 the numbers exactly what it means in our goal quite simple 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.319
 simple stories 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:20.620
 Hirst from now 1 off 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.280
 Jakob in buses may have ticked ticks I would like the last time on 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.849
 to lose 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:26.949
 his 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:30.000
 these are always practical 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:33.979
 the men from the draw 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:35.300
 Tour house 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.300
 Bryant and the intervals minor key St 

00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:39.830
 from c
