00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
you can japan so they're not really

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
that are driving them are driving them

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.770 
that are driving them are driving them
like<00:00:32.040> they're<00:00:32.219> racing<00:00:32.610> car<00:00:32.820> games<00:00:33.090> which<00:00:33.630> is

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
like they're racing car games which is

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.229 
like they're racing car games which is
why<00:00:33.930> they're<00:00:34.079> crashing<00:00:34.469> so<00:00:34.649> often<00:00:35.149> there's<00:00:36.149> a

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
why they're crashing so often there's a

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.569 
why they're crashing so often there's a
simulator<00:00:36.660> it's<00:00:37.320> pretty<00:00:37.739> tricky<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.280> drive

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
simulator it's pretty tricky to drive

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.510 
simulator it's pretty tricky to drive
it's<00:00:38.879> not<00:00:39.649> it's<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.739> little<00:00:41.010> bit<00:00:41.100> overly

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
it's not it's a little bit overly

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.240 
it's not it's a little bit overly
sensitive<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:43.110> conditions<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.739> give<00:00:43.980> that

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
sensitive and the conditions I give that

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.490 
sensitive and the conditions I give that
person<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.820> driving<00:00:45.270> on<00:00:45.390> ice<00:00:45.690> there<00:00:46.079> which<00:00:46.350> is

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
person is driving on ice there which is

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.299 
person is driving on ice there which is
why<00:00:46.649> it's<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:46.829> slippery<00:00:47.420> so<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.690> extra<00:00:49.050> as<00:00:49.620> you

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
why it's so slippery so the extra as you

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.930 
why it's so slippery so the extra as you
can<00:00:50.460> see<00:00:50.610> extremely<00:00:51.090> difficult<00:00:52.520> so<00:00:53.520> probably

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
can see extremely difficult so probably

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.729 
can see extremely difficult so probably
need<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.180> be<00:00:54.360> driven<00:00:54.600> more<00:00:54.870> gently<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.410> think

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
need to be driven more gently I think

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.049 
need to be driven more gently I think
it's<00:00:55.920> supposed<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.309> encourage<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.910> be<00:00:57.030> a

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
it's supposed to encourage you to be a

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.410 
it's supposed to encourage you to be a
more<00:00:58.910> sensible<00:01:01.100> careful<00:01:02.100> driver<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.760> the

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
more sensible careful driver and the

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.969 
more sensible careful driver and the
staff<00:01:03.690> they<00:01:03.930> are<00:01:04.080> actually<00:01:04.260> saying<00:01:04.710> that

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
staff they are actually saying that

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.230 
staff they are actually saying that
there's<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.220> couple<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.610> ladies<00:01:05.790> here<00:01:06.119> in

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
there's a couple of ladies here in

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.690 
there's a couple of ladies here in
uniforms<00:01:06.840> with<00:01:07.020> hats<00:01:07.229> on<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.680> were<00:01:07.799> sort<00:01:08.640> of

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
uniforms with hats on that were sort of

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.390 
uniforms with hats on that were sort of
giving<00:01:09.030> advice<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.659> suggestions<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.560> most

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
giving advice and suggestions and most

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.890 
giving advice and suggestions and most
of<00:01:11.580> their<00:01:11.729> advice<00:01:12.030> tend<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.540> stand<00:01:12.780> around

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
of their advice tend to stand around

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.170 
of their advice tend to stand around
just<00:01:13.260> being<00:01:13.470> slower<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.130> more<00:01:14.250> careful<00:01:14.880> so

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
just being slower and more careful so

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.980 
just being slower and more careful so
that<00:01:15.799> was<00:01:16.799> sort<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.460> aim<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.909> exercise

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.359 

that<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.290> probably<00:01:22.650> just<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.860> bit<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.070> PR

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
that and probably just a bit of PR

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.640 
that and probably just a bit of PR
because<00:01:23.939> this<00:01:24.119> part<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.659> complex<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.409> just

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
because this part of the complex is just

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.520 
because this part of the complex is just
open<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.189> public<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:26.790> it's<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.970> bit<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.180> PR

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
open to the public so it's a bit of PR

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.730 
open to the public so it's a bit of PR
between<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.619> Toyota<00:01:28.950> Motor<00:01:29.130> Company<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.850> the

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
between the Toyota Motor Company and the

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.670 
between the Toyota Motor Company and the
public<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.600> it's<00:01:33.600> really<00:01:33.720> about<00:01:33.900> driving<00:01:34.470> in

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
public so it's really about driving in

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:42.550 
public so it's really about driving in
fog<00:01:34.950> as<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.340> can<00:01:35.460> see<00:01:35.700> there

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.980 

so<00:01:43.189> yeah<00:01:43.520> that<00:01:43.820> are<00:01:43.880> a<00:01:43.939> bit<00:01:43.970> of<00:01:44.180> fun<00:01:44.390> telling<00:01:44.960> a

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
so yeah that are a bit of fun telling a

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:54.130 
so yeah that are a bit of fun telling a
bit<00:01:45.140> different

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.010 

the<00:01:55.140> temptation<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.979> speed<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.640> know<00:01:57.020> because

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
the temptation to speed you know because

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.870 
the temptation to speed you know because
it<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.289> closer<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.890> racing<00:01:59.250> car<00:01:59.280> game<00:01:59.490> that

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
it is closer to a racing car game that

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.340 
it is closer to a racing car game that
is<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.180> sitting<00:02:00.450> in<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.600> real<00:02:00.720> car<00:02:00.990> which<00:02:01.320> is

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
is to sitting in a real car which is

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.690 
is to sitting in a real car which is
what<00:02:01.710> results<00:02:02.250> in<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:03.710> anyway<00:02:04.710> that's<00:02:05.579> the

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
what results in that anyway that's the

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.610 
what results in that anyway that's the
funny<00:02:05.880> one<00:02:06.119> more<00:02:06.600> videos<00:02:07.399> coming<00:02:08.399> soon
