was<00:02:00.579> okay<00:02:00.909> by<00:02:01.209> me<00:02:01.240> his<00:02:01.420> truck<00:02:01.630> had<00:02:01.810> some<00:02:01.959> damage

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
was okay by me his truck had some damage

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.139 
was okay by me his truck had some damage
but<00:02:02.619> it's<00:02:02.889> like<00:02:03.039> he<00:02:03.219> could<00:02:03.429> he<00:02:03.909> didn't

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
but it's like he could he didn't

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:05.699 
but it's like he could he didn't
understand<00:02:04.539> what<00:02:04.630> happened<00:02:05.109> so<00:02:05.259> he<00:02:05.319> called<00:02:05.590> me

00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:05.709 
understand what happened so he called me

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:06.990 
understand what happened so he called me
for<00:02:05.740> a<00:02:05.950> session<00:02:06.219> and

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
for a session and

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.219 
for a session and
I<00:02:07.030> so<00:02:07.210> it<00:02:07.300> sounds<00:02:07.570> like<00:02:07.660> you<00:02:07.810> kind<00:02:08.020> of<00:02:08.080> went

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
I so it sounds like you kind of went

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.810 
I so it sounds like you kind of went
through<00:02:08.410> a<00:02:08.440> vortex<00:02:08.649> or<00:02:09.039> something<00:02:09.490> that<00:02:09.670> was

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
through a vortex or something that was

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.810 
through a vortex or something that was
up<00:02:09.970> there<00:02:10.320> this<00:02:11.320> was<00:02:11.530> a<00:02:11.560> couple<00:02:12.280> three<00:02:12.520> months

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
up there this was a couple three months

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.640 
up there this was a couple three months
ago<00:02:12.910> and<00:02:13.240> it<00:02:13.360> wasn't<00:02:13.750> until<00:02:14.020> today<00:02:14.440> when<00:02:14.590> I

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
ago and it wasn't until today when I

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.140 
ago and it wasn't until today when I
talked<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:14.950> him<00:02:15.100> again<00:02:15.310> that<00:02:15.490> I<00:02:15.580> began<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:15.970> put

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
talked to him again that I began to put

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.080 
talked to him again that I began to put
it<00:02:16.270> two<00:02:16.720> and<00:02:16.840> two<00:02:16.960> together<00:02:17.250> there<00:02:18.250> are<00:02:18.490> there

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
it two and two together there are there

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.310 
it two and two together there are there
are<00:02:19.120> stargates<00:02:19.750> opening<00:02:19.960> and<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:23.100> they<00:02:24.100> will

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
are stargates opening and and they will

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.020 
are stargates opening and and they will
impact<00:02:26.320> the<00:02:26.530> area<00:02:26.680> they<00:02:26.980> allow<00:02:27.220> energies

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
impact the area they allow energies

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.000 
impact the area they allow energies
galactic<00:02:28.720> energies<00:02:29.140> cosmic<00:02:29.530> energies<00:02:29.860> to

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
galactic energies cosmic energies to

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.580 
galactic energies cosmic energies to
come<00:02:30.220> in<00:02:30.459> and<00:02:30.670> they<00:02:30.760> also<00:02:30.940> there<00:02:31.750> like<00:02:31.959> a<00:02:31.990> way

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
come in and they also there like a way

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.760 
come in and they also there like a way
for<00:02:32.920> our<00:02:33.540> galactic<00:02:34.540> brothers<00:02:35.020> and<00:02:35.140> sisters<00:02:35.500> to

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
for our galactic brothers and sisters to

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.000 
for our galactic brothers and sisters to
come<00:02:35.950> into<00:02:36.160> earth<00:02:36.510> you<00:02:37.510> know<00:02:37.630> to<00:02:37.690> find<00:02:38.050> us<00:02:38.260> it's

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
come into earth you know to find us it's

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.640 
come into earth you know to find us it's
not<00:02:39.190> like<00:02:39.430> it's<00:02:39.970> not<00:02:40.090> like<00:02:40.239> they<00:02:40.840> haven't<00:02:41.080> been

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
not like it's not like they haven't been

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:42.860 
not like it's not like they haven't been
there<00:02:41.830> before<00:02:41.980> they've<00:02:42.340> always<00:02:42.489> been<00:02:42.610> there

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
there before they've always been there

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.900 
there before they've always been there
we<00:02:43.870> are<00:02:43.989> actually<00:02:44.170> moving<00:02:44.770> up<00:02:45.070> in<00:02:45.220> this<00:02:45.340> spiral

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
we are actually moving up in this spiral

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.000 
we are actually moving up in this spiral
of<00:02:46.090> dimensions<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.810> earth<00:02:46.959> is<00:02:47.170> ascending<00:02:47.770> and

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
of dimensions the earth is ascending and

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.150 
of dimensions the earth is ascending and
so<00:02:48.190> she's<00:02:48.459> moving<00:02:48.820> into<00:02:49.090> an<00:02:49.209> area<00:02:49.480> or<00:02:49.930> a

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
so she's moving into an area or a

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.500 
so she's moving into an area or a
dimensional<00:02:51.160> area<00:02:51.550> in<00:02:51.700> which<00:02:51.940> these<00:02:52.209> things

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
dimensional area in which these things

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.660 
dimensional area in which these things
just<00:02:52.660> normally<00:02:53.080> exist<00:02:53.260> it's<00:02:53.739> like<00:02:53.890> we've<00:02:54.400> been

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
just normally exist it's like we've been

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.210 
just normally exist it's like we've been
we've<00:02:55.330> been<00:02:55.480> like<00:02:55.690> on<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:56.080> farm<00:02:56.380> is<00:02:56.709> this

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
we've been like on the farm is this

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.860 
we've been like on the farm is this
friend<00:02:57.400> of<00:02:57.520> mine<00:02:57.610> said<00:02:58.030> and<00:02:58.270> now<00:02:58.660> we've<00:02:58.840> moved

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
friend of mine said and now we've moved

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.630 
friend of mine said and now we've moved
into<00:02:59.110> the<00:02:59.290> city<00:02:59.560> and<00:02:59.680> realize<00:03:00.040> it<00:03:00.250> you<00:03:00.430> can<00:03:00.550> go

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
into the city and realize it you can go

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.460 
into the city and realize it you can go
lots<00:03:00.910> of<00:03:01.060> places<00:03:01.120> to<00:03:01.540> all<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:01.900> you<00:03:02.140> know<00:03:02.260> the

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
lots of places to all the you know the

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.290 
lots of places to all the you know the
highway<00:03:02.860> system<00:03:03.340> in<00:03:03.489> the<00:03:03.550> city<00:03:03.790> and<00:03:05.580> so<00:03:06.580> it<00:03:06.730> so

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
highway system in the city and so it so

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.449 
highway system in the city and so it so
it's<00:03:07.480> not<00:03:07.690> that<00:03:08.080> they<00:03:08.440> haven't<00:03:08.709> always<00:03:09.040> been

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
it's not that they haven't always been

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:10.979 
it's not that they haven't always been
there<00:03:09.730> it's<00:03:09.880> just<00:03:10.000> that<00:03:10.180> we<00:03:10.360> are<00:03:10.480> our<00:03:10.600> planet

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
there it's just that we are our planet

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.500 
there it's just that we are our planet
is<00:03:11.049> now<00:03:11.170> moving<00:03:11.410> up<00:03:11.680> into<00:03:11.830> that<00:03:12.040> area<00:03:12.310> where<00:03:12.670> we

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
is now moving up into that area where we

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.650 
is now moving up into that area where we
become<00:03:14.290> aware<00:03:14.530> that<00:03:14.980> they<00:03:15.160> are<00:03:15.190> there<00:03:15.610> so<00:03:16.269> it

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
become aware that they are there so it

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.229 
become aware that they are there so it
creates<00:03:17.080> like<00:03:17.260> a<00:03:17.290> disconnect<00:03:18.010> between<00:03:18.280> the

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
creates like a disconnect between the

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.930 
creates like a disconnect between the
soul<00:03:19.930> and<00:03:19.959> the<00:03:20.260> body<00:03:20.350> are<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:21.459> consciousness

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
soul and the body are the consciousness

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.430 
soul and the body are the consciousness
in<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.120> body<00:03:22.330> and<00:03:22.480> that<00:03:22.600> is<00:03:22.780> be<00:03:22.959> caught<00:03:23.170> and

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
in the body and that is be caught and

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.140 
in the body and that is be caught and
this<00:03:23.739> guy's<00:03:23.950> been<00:03:24.100> doing<00:03:24.430> his<00:03:24.580> work<00:03:24.790> so<00:03:25.060> of

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
this guy's been doing his work so of

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.449 
this guy's been doing his work so of
course<00:03:25.330> he's<00:03:25.600> right<00:03:26.190> resonating<00:03:27.190> it<00:03:27.280> a<00:03:27.340> little

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
course he's right resonating it a little

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.070 
course he's right resonating it a little
bit<00:03:27.640> higher<00:03:27.820> frequency<00:03:28.480> than<00:03:28.510> the<00:03:28.810> average

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
bit higher frequency than the average

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.229 
bit higher frequency than the average
third<00:03:29.350> dimensional<00:03:29.860> human<00:03:30.250> so<00:03:30.730> it<00:03:30.820> did<00:03:31.000> create

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
third dimensional human so it did create

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.550 
third dimensional human so it did create
a<00:03:31.450> lot<00:03:31.630> that<00:03:31.840> blackout<00:03:32.350> effect<00:03:32.769> for<00:03:33.040> him<00:03:33.250> and

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
a lot that blackout effect for him and

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.780 
a lot that blackout effect for him and
so<00:03:35.560> I<00:03:35.590> think<00:03:35.709> we're<00:03:36.010> going<00:03:36.100> to<00:03:36.190> be<00:03:36.310> seeing<00:03:36.549> that

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
so I think we're going to be seeing that

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.210 
so I think we're going to be seeing that
more<00:03:37.030> and<00:03:37.090> more<00:03:37.380> that<00:03:38.380> so<00:03:38.680> that<00:03:38.829> brings<00:03:39.010> me<00:03:39.130> to

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
more and more that so that brings me to

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.229 
more and more that so that brings me to
the<00:03:39.850> next<00:03:39.880> point<00:03:40.209> which<00:03:40.630> is<00:03:41.820> what<00:03:42.820> do<00:03:42.940> we<00:03:43.060> do

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
the next point which is what do we do

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.140 
the next point which is what do we do
about<00:03:43.750> these<00:03:44.700> these<00:03:45.700> things<00:03:45.940> that<00:03:46.000> are

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
about these these things that are

walking between two worlds that's really

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.030 
walking between two worlds that's really
really<00:03:55.810> happening<00:03:56.320> for<00:03:56.530> those<00:03:56.650> of<00:03:56.799> you<00:03:56.890> who

you're basically you got a foot in two

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.220 
you're basically you got a foot in two
worlds<00:04:06.250> and<00:04:06.989> when<00:04:07.989> you<00:04:08.140> live<00:04:08.380> like<00:04:08.650> that

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
worlds and when you live like that

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.140 
worlds and when you live like that
are<00:04:09.319> constantly<00:04:09.860> having<00:04:10.159> to<00:04:10.280> recalibrate<00:04:10.730> and

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
are constantly having to recalibrate and

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.170 
are constantly having to recalibrate and
rebalance<00:04:11.810> over<00:04:12.200> and<00:04:12.319> over<00:04:12.470> again<00:04:12.709> and<00:04:13.190> it

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
rebalance over and over again and it

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.789 
rebalance over and over again and it
creates<00:04:14.720> physical<00:04:15.590> symptoms<00:04:15.920> like<00:04:16.100> fatigue

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
creates physical symptoms like fatigue

creates physical symptoms like fatigue
some<00:04:18.799> of<00:04:18.889> the<00:04:18.949> memory<00:04:19.250> loss<00:04:19.430> that<00:04:19.669> we're

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
some of the memory loss that we're

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.490 
some of the memory loss that we're
having<00:04:19.970> is<00:04:20.269> attributed<00:04:21.019> to<00:04:21.049> that<00:04:21.169> and

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
having is attributed to that and

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.379 
having is attributed to that and
certainly<00:04:21.650> a<00:04:21.889> lot<00:04:22.280> of<00:04:22.430> the<00:04:22.580> the<00:04:22.880> grounding

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
certainly a lot of the the grounding

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.170 
certainly a lot of the the grounding
issues<00:04:23.810> are<00:04:24.050> having<00:04:24.560> our<00:04:25.060> tribute<00:04:26.060> to<00:04:26.120> that

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
issues are having our tribute to that

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.090 
issues are having our tribute to that
because<00:04:26.449> it's<00:04:26.660> like<00:04:26.780> the<00:04:26.960> body<00:04:27.139> secret<00:04:27.590> what
