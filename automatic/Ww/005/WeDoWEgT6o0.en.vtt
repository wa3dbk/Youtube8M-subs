00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
back into the tank that didn't work out

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.389 
back into the tank that didn't work out
too<00:00:39.930> well<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.350> want<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.710> try<00:00:40.890> something<00:00:41.190> out

too well so I want to try something out

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.400 
too well so I want to try something out
in<00:00:41.670> this<00:00:42.090> episode<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.840> we've<00:00:42.960> done<00:00:43.200> before

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
in this episode that we've done before

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.580 
in this episode that we've done before
using<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.550> space<00:00:44.879> docker<00:00:45.239> right<00:00:46.110> now<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.289> am

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
using the space docker right now I am

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.190 
using the space docker right now I am
flying<00:00:46.920> around<00:00:47.309> as<00:00:47.579> Michael<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.480> epsilon

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
flying around as Michael in the epsilon

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.779 
flying around as Michael in the epsilon
outfit<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.039> in<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.820> tank<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.860> Franklin<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.579> we

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
outfit and in the tank is Franklin so we

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.060 
outfit and in the tank is Franklin so we
are<00:00:53.940> going<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.480> ascend<00:00:55.020> high<00:00:55.469> above<00:00:56.039> the

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
are going to ascend high above the

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.770 
are going to ascend high above the
military<00:00:56.730> base<00:00:56.969> find<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.109> UFO<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:59.780> hopefully

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
military base find the UFO and hopefully

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.380 
military base find the UFO and hopefully
we<00:01:00.899> can<00:01:01.079> drop<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.530> onto<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.640> UFO<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.239> that

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
we can drop it onto the the UFO so that

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.660 
we can drop it onto the the UFO so that
way<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.629> sticks<00:01:03.960> we<00:01:04.680> can<00:01:04.860> switch<00:01:05.309> up<00:01:05.519> to

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
way it sticks we can switch up to

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.630 
way it sticks we can switch up to
Franklin<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.420> then<00:01:07.140> we'll<00:01:07.350> be<00:01:07.500> on<00:01:07.650> top<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.369> the

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
Franklin and then we'll be on top of the

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.770 
Franklin and then we'll be on top of the
UFO<00:01:09.090> with<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.380> mighty<00:01:10.650> Rhino<00:01:11.400> tank<00:01:11.909> that

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
UFO with the mighty Rhino tank that

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.080 
UFO with the mighty Rhino tank that
would<00:01:13.020> be<00:01:13.170> pretty<00:01:13.320> crazy<00:01:13.740> now<00:01:14.189> those<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:14.970> you

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
would be pretty crazy now those of you

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.730 
would be pretty crazy now those of you
who<00:01:15.270> have<00:01:15.420> been<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.960> chiliad<00:01:16.290> mystery

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
who have been to the chiliad mystery

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.740 
who have been to the chiliad mystery
mural<00:01:17.100> or<00:01:17.250> who<00:01:17.700> have<00:01:17.790> seen<00:01:18.090> me<00:01:18.270> shut<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.600> off

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
mural or who have seen me shut it off

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.980 
mural or who have seen me shut it off
know<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.500> there's<00:01:19.680> an<00:01:19.830> indentation<00:01:20.189> right

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
know that there's an indentation right

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.810 
know that there's an indentation right
across<00:01:21.990> from<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.979> mural<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.369> it's<00:01:23.520> kind<00:01:23.759> of

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
across from the mural and it's kind of

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.940 
across from the mural and it's kind of
odd<00:01:24.030> we're<00:01:24.450> not<00:01:24.570> too<00:01:24.750> sure<00:01:24.780> why<00:01:25.200> it's<00:01:25.409> there<00:01:25.590> it

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
odd we're not too sure why it's there it

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.219 
odd we're not too sure why it's there it
probably<00:01:26.310> does<00:01:26.820> symbolize<00:01:27.299> something<00:01:27.810> and

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
probably does symbolize something and

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.200 
probably does symbolize something and
the<00:01:28.920> only<00:01:29.100> thing<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:29.970> could

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
the only thing that that I could

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.819 
the only thing that that I could
actually<00:01:30.329> think<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.840> making<00:01:31.140> that

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
actually think of making that

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.420 
actually think of making that
indentation<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.509> Rhino<00:01:33.720> tank<00:01:34.110> itself<00:01:34.560> you

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
indentation is the Rhino tank itself you

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.780 
indentation is the Rhino tank itself you
have<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.880> huge<00:01:36.240> cannon<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.130> it<00:01:38.130> almost<00:01:38.400> seems

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
have the huge cannon and it almost seems

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.270 
have the huge cannon and it almost seems
like<00:01:38.909> that<00:01:39.210> scratched<00:01:39.869> across<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.619> wall<00:01:40.829> it's

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
like that scratched across the wall it's

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.399 
like that scratched across the wall it's
either<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.670> or<00:01:41.880> maybe<00:01:42.299> some<00:01:42.869> kind<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:43.200> high

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
either that or maybe some kind of high

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.280 
either that or maybe some kind of high
powerful<00:01:44.070> laser<00:01:44.430> weapon<00:01:45.079> something<00:01:46.079> like

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
powerful laser weapon something like

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.230 
powerful laser weapon something like
that<00:01:46.560> but<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:47.130> think<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.820> might<00:01:48.000> have<00:01:48.180> something

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
that but I think it might have something

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.060 
that but I think it might have something
to<00:01:48.689> do<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.110> tank<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:49.649> maybe<00:01:49.860> there's

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
to do the tank so maybe there's

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.010 
to do the tank so maybe there's
something<00:01:50.280> we<00:01:50.430> need<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.700> do<00:01:51.030> with<00:01:51.750> the

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
something we need to do with the

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.649 
something we need to do with the
probably<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.829> best<00:01:53.159> vehicle<00:01:53.790> in<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.450> game

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
probably the best vehicle in the game

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.719 
probably the best vehicle in the game
when<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:54.990> comes<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.380> destructive<00:01:56.009> fire<00:01:56.369> power

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
when it comes to destructive fire power

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.850 
when it comes to destructive fire power
it<00:01:57.659> would<00:01:57.780> be<00:01:57.869> awesome<00:01:58.049> if<00:01:58.409> we<00:01:58.469> could<00:01:58.590> actually

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
it would be awesome if we could actually

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.789 
it would be awesome if we could actually
take<00:01:59.340> out<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.759> UFOs<00:02:00.270> with<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.719> tank<00:02:00.990> if<00:02:01.500> you

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
take out the UFOs with the tank if you

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.280 
take out the UFOs with the tank if you
play<00:02:02.070> in<00:02:02.250> halo<00:02:02.729> especially<00:02:03.299> halo<00:02:03.689> 3<00:02:04.049> where<00:02:04.229> you

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
play in halo especially halo 3 where you

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.050

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
you know in some cases the brute

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.110 
you know in some cases the brute
vehicles<00:02:17.200> you<00:02:17.680> can<00:02:17.710> blow<00:02:18.100> that<00:02:18.280> shit<00:02:18.610> up<00:02:18.640> just

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
vehicles you can blow that shit up just

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.410 
vehicles you can blow that shit up just
by<00:02:19.240> using<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.890> cannon<00:02:21.520> from<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:21.880> tank<00:02:22.150> so

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
by using the the cannon from the tank so

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.180 
by using the the cannon from the tank so
maybe<00:02:22.690> you<00:02:22.900> have<00:02:23.080> to<00:02:23.200> do<00:02:23.350> something<00:02:23.680> similar

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
maybe you have to do something similar

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.600 
maybe you have to do something similar
here<00:02:25.060> in<00:02:25.300> Grand<00:02:25.570> Theft<00:02:25.750> Auto<00:02:25.930> 5<00:02:26.250> where<00:02:27.250> you

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
here in Grand Theft Auto 5 where you

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.720 
here in Grand Theft Auto 5 where you
blow<00:02:27.880> up<00:02:28.000> a<00:02:28.420> UFO<00:02:28.870> with<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:29.980> tank<00:02:30.250> now<00:02:30.520> I<00:02:30.550> don't

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
blow up a UFO with the tank now I don't

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.220 
blow up a UFO with the tank now I don't
know<00:02:30.970> how<00:02:31.090> that's<00:02:31.300> possible<00:02:31.510> because<00:02:31.900> if<00:02:32.110> you

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
know how that's possible because if you

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.010 
know how that's possible because if you
think<00:02:32.260> of<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.890> chili<00:02:33.190> at<00:02:33.370> UFO<00:02:33.820> or<00:02:34.090> maybe<00:02:34.750> you

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
think of the chili at UFO or maybe you

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.900 
think of the chili at UFO or maybe you
can<00:02:35.170> get<00:02:35.320> a<00:02:35.380> tank<00:02:35.710> up<00:02:35.950> there<00:02:36.190> in<00:02:36.370> fact<00:02:36.610> we've

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
can get a tank up there in fact we've

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.660 
can get a tank up there in fact we've
done<00:02:37.150> it<00:02:37.300> before<00:02:37.330> using<00:02:37.930> a<00:02:38.140> cheat<00:02:38.440> but<00:02:38.650> if<00:02:39.370> you

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
done it before using a cheat but if you

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.640 
done it before using a cheat but if you
got<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.270> UFO<00:02:40.930> to<00:02:40.990> show<00:02:41.200> up<00:02:41.320> there<00:02:41.470> and<00:02:41.560> he

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
got the UFO to show up there and he

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.140 
got the UFO to show up there and he
tried<00:02:41.860> to<00:02:41.980> shoot<00:02:42.010> it<00:02:42.250> with<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.370> tank<00:02:42.700> of

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
tried to shoot it with the tank of

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.210 
tried to shoot it with the tank of
course<00:02:43.390> that<00:02:43.630> one<00:02:43.840> is<00:02:44.170> holographic<00:02:44.590> so<00:02:45.160> you

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
course that one is holographic so you

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.950 
course that one is holographic so you
would<00:02:45.400> shoot<00:02:45.670> right<00:02:45.880> through<00:02:45.910> it<00:02:46.300> the<00:02:46.750> other

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
would shoot right through it the other

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.200 
would shoot right through it the other
two<00:02:47.260> of<00:02:47.440> UFOs<00:02:48.040> that<00:02:48.070> are<00:02:48.340> solid<00:02:48.790> you<00:02:48.910> have<00:02:49.060> the

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
the tank on it hope that the the thing

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.450 
the tank on it hope that the the thing
actually<00:03:01.030> sticks<00:03:01.570> on<00:03:01.810> there<00:03:02.110> and<00:03:02.260> then<00:03:02.460> switch

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
actually sticks on there and then switch

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.110 
actually sticks on there and then switch

to to uh to Franklin on the fly and you

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.730 
to to uh to Franklin on the fly and you
do<00:03:07.510> not<00:03:07.660> want<00:03:07.720> them<00:03:08.110> to<00:03:08.260> hang<00:03:08.440> out<00:03:08.590> because

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
do not want them to hang out because

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.530 
do not want them to hang out because
once<00:03:09.070> the<00:03:09.220> two<00:03:09.400> characters<00:03:09.640> are<00:03:10.000> hanging<00:03:10.390> out

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
once the two characters are hanging out

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.050 
once the two characters are hanging out
you<00:03:11.200> cannot<00:03:11.560> switch<00:03:12.040> in<00:03:12.280> between<00:03:12.310> them<00:03:12.850> two

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
you cannot switch in between them two

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.990 
you cannot switch in between them two
it's<00:03:13.930> a<00:03:14.080> little<00:03:14.380> bit<00:03:14.560> complicated<00:03:14.980> but<00:03:15.550> take

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
it's a little bit complicated but take

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.580 
it's a little bit complicated but take
my<00:03:16.180> word<00:03:16.210> for<00:03:16.630> it<00:03:16.660> this<00:03:16.810> is<00:03:16.959> probably<00:03:17.200> going<00:03:17.500> to

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
my word for it this is probably going to

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.720 
my word for it this is probably going to
be<00:03:17.770> the<00:03:17.800> only<00:03:18.070> way<00:03:18.490> for<00:03:19.150> zancudo<00:03:19.720> UFO<00:03:20.730> playing

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
be the only way for zancudo UFO playing

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.570 
be the only way for zancudo UFO playing
crazy-looking<00:03:22.600> UFO<00:03:23.020> it's<00:03:23.290> very<00:03:23.770> unique<00:03:23.980> looks

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 
nothing like the others in the game

get a pretty good distance away from
this<00:03:39.700> thing<00:03:39.760> because<00:03:40.390> it<00:03:40.420> will<00:03:40.720> turn<00:03:40.900> off<00:03:41.080> your

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
this thing because it will turn off your

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.770 
this thing because it will turn off your
engine<00:03:41.620> and<00:03:41.770> because<00:03:42.610> we<00:03:42.790> are<00:03:42.940> towing<00:03:43.390> the

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
engine and because we are towing the

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.410 
engine and because we are towing the
tank<00:03:44.170> we<00:03:44.440> will<00:03:44.470> fall<00:03:44.920> like<00:03:44.950> a<00:03:45.190> rock<00:03:45.550> you<00:03:46.240> could

tank we will fall like a rock you could
already<00:03:46.570> tell<00:03:46.690> that<00:03:46.900> we<00:03:47.230> were<00:03:47.320> lifting<00:03:47.709> up<00:03:47.890> a

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
already tell that we were lifting up a

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.530
