hey guys I'm Connor Donegan 17 years old

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.790 
hey guys I'm Connor Donegan 17 years old
and<00:00:40.060> I'm<00:00:40.210> going<00:00:40.570> to<00:00:40.720> show<00:00:40.870> you<00:00:40.930> today<00:00:41.230> the

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
and I'm going to show you today the

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.250 
and I'm going to show you today the
mechanics<00:00:42.430> of<00:00:42.700> picking<00:00:43.570> how<00:00:44.559> to<00:00:44.620> move<00:00:44.920> the<00:00:45.070> pic

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
mechanics of picking how to move the pic

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.200 
mechanics of picking how to move the pic
hold<00:00:47.260> it<00:00:47.559> how<00:00:48.430> to<00:00:48.489> make<00:00:48.700> your<00:00:48.760> pick<00:00:49.059> them

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
hold it how to make your pick them

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.950 
hold it how to make your pick them
faster<00:00:49.690> stuff<00:00:50.320> like<00:00:50.530> that<00:00:50.559> I<00:00:51.629> first<00:00:52.629> thing<00:00:52.870> I'm

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
faster stuff like that I first thing I'm

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.780 
faster stuff like that I first thing I'm
going<00:00:53.050> to<00:00:53.110> show<00:00:53.199> you<00:00:53.350> guys<00:00:53.489> it's<00:00:54.489> the<00:00:54.550> first

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
going to show you guys it's the first

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.000 
going to show you guys it's the first
base<00:00:55.090> of<00:00:55.300> thing<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:56.770> start<00:00:57.540> by<00:00:59.010> alternate

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
base of thing you start by alternate

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.310 
base of thing you start by alternate
picking<00:01:00.190> on<00:01:00.550> the<00:01:00.760> E<00:01:00.790> string<00:01:01.180> down<00:01:01.930> stroke

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
picking on the E string down stroke

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.340 
picking on the E string down stroke
obscure<00:01:02.949> downstroke<00:01:03.760> upstroke<00:01:04.360> you<00:01:05.140> keep

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
obscure downstroke upstroke you keep

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.950 
obscure downstroke upstroke you keep
going<00:01:05.530> faster<00:01:05.860> and<00:01:06.130> faster<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:07.270> so<00:01:07.479> you<00:01:07.659> can't

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
going faster and faster and so you can't

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.960 
going faster and faster and so you can't
go<00:01:08.110> fast<00:01:08.440> anymore<00:01:08.710> so<00:01:09.130> an<00:01:09.310> example<00:01:09.430> what<00:01:09.820> that

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
go fast anymore so an example what that

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:22.410 
go fast anymore so an example what that
would<00:01:10.090> be

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.429 

so<00:01:24.340> up<00:01:25.340> down<00:01:25.729> up<00:01:26.060> down<00:01:26.119> up<00:01:26.570> down<00:01:26.630> up<00:01:26.810> down<00:01:26.990> until

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
so up down up down up down up down until

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.700 
so up down up down up down up down until
you<00:01:27.560> just<00:01:27.799> can't<00:01:28.070> do<00:01:28.340> it<00:01:28.570> you<00:01:29.570> know<00:01:29.750> any<00:01:30.140> faster

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
you just can't do it you know any faster

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.389 
you just can't do it you know any faster
and<00:01:31.210> practice<00:01:32.210> that<00:01:32.240> a<00:01:32.420> lot<00:01:33.100> next<00:01:34.100> thing<00:01:34.250> you

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
and practice that a lot next thing you

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.830 
and practice that a lot next thing you
want<00:01:34.520> to<00:01:34.640> do<00:01:34.850> is<00:01:35.409> you<00:01:36.409> want<00:01:37.189> to<00:01:37.430> start<00:01:37.729> on<00:01:38.570> the

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
want to do is you want to start on the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
want to do is you want to start on the
second<00:01:39.200> fret<00:01:39.350> you<00:01:39.830> want<00:01:40.039> to<00:01:40.100> go<00:01:40.899> one<00:01:42.159> two<00:01:43.570> three

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
second fret you want to go one two three

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.859 
second fret you want to go one two three
four<00:01:45.860> you<00:01:46.729> want<00:01:46.850> to<00:01:47.000> move<00:01:47.149> that<00:01:47.299> up<00:01:47.479> a<00:01:47.600> fret

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
four you want to move that up a fret

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.850 
four you want to move that up a fret
each<00:01:48.229> time<00:01:48.619> so<00:01:48.860> it'll<00:01:48.979> be<00:01:49.070> one<00:01:49.460> two<00:01:49.909> three<00:01:50.360> four

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
each time so it'll be one two three four

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.710 
each time so it'll be one two three four
1234<00:01:52.240> 1234<00:01:53.240> 1234<00:01:54.110> 1234<00:01:54.770> 1234<00:01:55.459> 12<00:01:56.030> people<00:01:56.299> and

1234 1234 1234 1234 1234 12 people and
you<00:01:56.840> do<00:01:56.929> that<00:01:57.080> all<00:01:57.289> the<00:01:57.319> way<00:01:57.440> up<00:01:57.649> the<00:01:57.740> neck<00:01:57.770> so

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
you do that all the way up the neck so

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:12.809 
you do that all the way up the neck so
that<00:02:07.000> ok<00:02:10.480> another<00:02:11.480> great<00:02:11.750> exercise<00:02:11.959> to<00:02:12.350> do

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
that ok another great exercise to do

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.449 
that ok another great exercise to do
this<00:02:13.819> one<00:02:14.060> gets<00:02:14.269> kind<00:02:14.480> of<00:02:14.540> hard<00:02:14.920> you<00:02:15.920> start<00:02:16.280> up

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
this one gets kind of hard you start up

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.330 
this one gets kind of hard you start up
here<00:02:16.790> on<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.090> third<00:02:17.390> on<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:18.860> low<00:02:19.069> E<00:02:19.310> string

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
here on the third on the low E string

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:27.190 
here on the third on the low E string
and<00:02:20.140> you<00:02:21.140> go<00:02:21.400> it's<00:02:25.090> 33<00:02:26.090> notes<00:02:26.239> per<00:02:26.510> string<00:02:26.540> so

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
and you go it's 33 notes per string so

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.460 
and you go it's 33 notes per string so
one<00:02:27.829> two<00:02:28.040> three<00:02:28.310> one<00:02:28.640> two<00:02:28.670> three<00:02:29.140> move<00:02:30.140> it<00:02:30.320> to<00:02:30.440> a

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
okay now that's going to help you switch

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.809 
okay now that's going to help you switch
over<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.209> strings<00:03:06.860> you<00:03:07.860> know<00:03:08.040> be<00:03:08.610> able<00:03:08.760> to

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
over the strings you know be able to

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.520 
over the strings you know be able to
move<00:03:08.970> around<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.329> swim<00:03:09.659> strings<00:03:10.200> water

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
move around the swim strings water

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.429 
move around the swim strings water
alternate<00:03:11.040> picking<00:03:11.810> and<00:03:12.810> another<00:03:13.200> great

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:13.439 
alternate picking and another great

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:15.500 
alternate picking and another great
thing<00:03:13.709> to<00:03:13.769> learn<00:03:14.159> that<00:03:14.519> will<00:03:15.060> help<00:03:15.209> you<00:03:15.359> move

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
thing to learn that will help you move

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.860 
thing to learn that will help you move
over<00:03:15.659> the<00:03:15.840> strings<00:03:16.170> is<00:03:16.970> this<00:03:17.970> pentatonic

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
over the strings is this pentatonic

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:25.520 
over the strings is this pentatonic
scale<00:03:19.170> look<00:03:19.500> and<00:03:20.150> it<00:03:21.150> goes<00:03:21.620> 85<00:03:23.989> pick<00:03:24.989> those<00:03:25.230> two

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
scale look and it goes 85 pick those two

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.080 
scale look and it goes 85 pick those two
and<00:03:25.909> then<00:03:26.909> pick<00:03:27.720> the<00:03:27.750> next<00:03:28.049> two<00:03:28.310> right<00:03:29.310> here<00:03:29.639> so
