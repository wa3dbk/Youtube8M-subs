that it feels crisper and faster than
gears<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.230> going<00:00:22.859> back<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.039> some<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.789> speed

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300

gears to going back to some of the speed
of<00:00:24.480> gears<00:00:24.720> one<00:00:24.930> while<00:00:25.470> maintaining<00:00:25.830> some<00:00:26.070> of

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
of gears one while maintaining some of

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.380 
of gears one while maintaining some of
the<00:00:26.220> control<00:00:26.550> refinements<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.090> we<00:00:27.300> were

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
the control refinements that we were

the control refinements that we were
able<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.630> put<00:00:27.779> into<00:00:28.019> so<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.230> think<00:00:28.320> we're<00:00:28.500> really

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
that's their thing we're more about

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.620 
that's their thing we're more about
executions<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:23.880> intimate<00:02:24.150> combat<00:02:24.510> and

getting in your face the thing about
gears<00:02:26.250> 3<00:02:26.520> is<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:26.700> can<00:02:26.850> actually<00:02:26.880> unlock

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
gears 3 is you can actually unlock

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.360 
gears 3 is you can actually unlock
executions<00:02:28.080> and<00:02:28.260> executions<00:02:29.040> will<00:02:29.160> give<00:02:29.280> you

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
executions and executions will give you

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.370 
executions and executions will give you
more<00:02:29.580> XP<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.120> more<00:02:30.240> points<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:31.050> longer

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
more XP and more points the longer

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.650 
more XP and more points the longer
executions<00:02:32.040> more<00:02:32.790> points<00:02:33.210> so<00:02:33.450> there's<00:02:33.600> a

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
executions more points so there's a

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.090 
executions more points so there's a
great<00:02:33.870> trade-off<00:02:34.170> of<00:02:34.320> risk<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.710> reward<00:02:34.770> that's

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
great trade-off of risk to reward that's

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.090 
great trade-off of risk to reward that's
now<00:02:35.250> implemented<00:02:35.850> in<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.030> game<00:02:36.210> so<00:02:37.110> I<00:02:37.680> guess

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
now implemented in the game so I guess

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.740 
now implemented in the game so I guess
