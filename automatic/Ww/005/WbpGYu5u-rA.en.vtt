00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.650

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.490

 they wanted it to seem like a joke but 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.050
 that's how it came out out loud 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.690
 The game was developed and published by 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.420
 scream network then you ask me who is and 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.800
 this company was founded for nothing. 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.570
 no less than people 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.540
 involved in the production of murder 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.479
 creed splinter are and uncharted okay 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.850
 for you outlet is a horror game that 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.670
 was released on September 4, 2013 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.310
 for PC and February 4 for 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.800
 playstation 4 and the game came with 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.810
 proposal to terrorize all levels 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.410
 using much visual terror and 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.330
 especially the psychological terror that 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.520
 is the one that stirs the anxiety makes if 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.300
 You blubber your pants, you shit with fear, that's it. 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.070
 same 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.080
 I 'm not joking now about the 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.270
 plot imagine that you are the reporter 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.880
 totally greedy, not waiting 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.400
 that great exclusive subject that goes 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.650
 bomb in every tabloid when 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.260
 You suddenly receive an email and talk 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.180
 This is my big chance, so give it to me. 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.819
 You go out to the fight and you'll make your 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.590
 matter within the asylum 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.900
 when you come within two kilometers of 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.660
 cell phones are simply losing the 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.180
 sign in there you think my beast 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.980
 Now everything alone has nothing to do I do not 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.700
 I have chosen and not the sausage for you 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.400
 to help 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.100
 there you have what a camera with vision 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.200
 night two piles my friend in one 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.180
 asylum to improve your options 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.160
 you do not know how to fight you do not have the slightest 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.990
 weapon skill and does not have it in the 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.680
 game and to survive you need to 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.440
 to hide 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.220
 time it all and run away as soon as 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.890
 required 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.680
 fighting is the same as dying is basically 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.270
 this is what suffers greater absorb 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.770
 I believe without being told 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.720
 only that the moment he enters the 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.550
 asylum he already realizes that the hole is 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.560
 more below the friend he thinks either 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.870
 know that chips scott was my friend 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.960
 only now he realizes that entering the 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.630
 Asylum was easy now to leave my friend 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.250
 It will be very complicated there. 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.050
 have some collectibles that will 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.610
 unraveling the game's plot this is well 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.190
 cool one is walking suddenly finds the 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.380
 document that tells the story of the game 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.180
 some things in the plot of protagonist 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.520
 he will also write down all his steps 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.500
 in your personal journal to continue 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.260
 now we are going to analyze the points 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.140
 the first positive point was 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.620
 is the setting and immersion in the game 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:47.340
 Almost 80% of the game is a 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.560
 dog and the other 20% of the setting is 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.270
 very dark what makes you 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.520
 have to use the camera in most 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.950
 Sometimes only you have no stack then 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.959
 this ends up leaving very afraid the 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.340
 sounds that the character emits as 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.100
 will happen in the most 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.650
 bizarre of the universe is amazing is 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:07.200
 very nice and that makes your dive into the 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.420
 game is almost complete is one of the 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.459
 few games I've seen of the genre that has 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.590
 such a great immersion 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:17.160
 The second positive point is the fact that 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:20.790
 you can not fight for positive rauf 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:24.120
 Mann is my very positive friends because the 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:26.220
 tension that the game provides is giant 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.340
 this time either I hesitated to 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:32.160
 play for fear and tension you do not 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.050
 Imagine , you speak, people are bullshit. 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.220
 Come on, brother. You think it's good. 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.110
 plays and pv 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.229
 The third positive point is that the game 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:44.280
 perfectly fulfills what he proposes to 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:47.130
 Anxiety fear scoundrel my very nice 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.750
 this part stays perfect you enter 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.850
 play is as if you feel the 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:54.330
 character you feel all the emotions 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:56.370
 that the character himself feels is proposed and 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.410
 I like games so much the 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.479
 fourth positive point for me is the 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.520
 gameplay because why she is well 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:04.740
 compared to other games of the 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.419
 gender an example let's put it like this 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.940
 you need to run away 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:09.990
 Good, I have to get away, but at least my 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.150
 he character 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.010
 runs very well he does not tire with 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.710
 ease and hardly it is 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.330
 locked in some wall or corner sack 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.310
 already happened a lot in other games 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.590
 examples laender or face seems to smoke 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.660
 11 packs of cigarettes a day as 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.270
 fandangos and coca cola and 3 bags of 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.190
 doritos understood 3 seconds is dead 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.020
 Now for negatives guys, I believe. 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.090
 that the graphics might be a bit 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.400
 better but I'm not complaining because 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.870
 environment solves this problem here 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.030
 I had horror games , not much. 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.490
 Importance of graphics and so perfect 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:44.160
 provided you make an atmosphere and 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:47.250
 a perfect soundtrack just as it is 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.740
 the outlet pump in my opinion if you 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:53.340
 for sado-masochist likes to take fright 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:55.830
 tension yesterday the lucky number is 666 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.470
 This game is perfect for you, but the 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.910
 Golf I like the game, but he is. 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.080
 dear people 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.720
 We have to get used to it. 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.330
 face in Brazil everything is expensive if you 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.490
 receive at least the family game 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.830
