00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.180 
the other champion change I wanted to
discuss<00:04:30.539> was<00:04:31.080> a<00:04:31.110> smaller<00:04:31.440> nerf<00:04:31.740> we're<00:04:31.919> making

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
discuss was a smaller nerf we're making

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.430 
discuss was a smaller nerf we're making

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
wither being cut in half nasus has

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.180 
wither being cut in half nasus has
traditionally<00:04:38.020> been<00:04:38.080> seen<00:04:38.470> as<00:04:38.620> a<00:04:38.650> week<00:04:38.920> pick

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
traditionally been seen as a week pick

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.920 
traditionally been seen as a week pick
and<00:04:39.430> he's<00:04:39.700> only<00:04:39.850> recently<00:04:40.450> gained<00:04:40.750> some

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
and he's only recently gained some

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.870 
and he's only recently gained some
popularity<00:04:41.080> with<00:04:41.680> buffs<00:04:42.010> in<00:04:42.190> a<00:04:42.280> previous<00:04:42.490> pack

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
popularity with buffs in a previous pack

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.210 
popularity with buffs in a previous pack
so<00:04:43.510> why<00:04:43.690> the<00:04:43.750> nerve<00:04:44.020> this<00:04:44.830> is<00:04:44.890> one<00:04:45.190> I

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
so why the nerve this is one I

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.470 
so why the nerve this is one I
definitely<00:04:45.580> wanted<00:04:45.880> to<00:04:45.970> talk<00:04:46.150> about<00:04:46.180> because

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
definitely wanted to talk about because

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.970 
definitely wanted to talk about because
I<00:04:46.600> think<00:04:46.840> it<00:04:46.930> can<00:04:47.080> be<00:04:47.200> a<00:04:47.230> little<00:04:47.380> confusing<00:04:47.560> to

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
I think it can be a little confusing to

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.170 
I think it can be a little confusing to
see<00:04:48.190> a<00:04:48.220> character<00:04:48.700> who's<00:04:48.850> been<00:04:49.030> so

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
see a character who's been so

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.270 
see a character who's been so
historically<00:04:49.870> week<00:04:50.020> finally<00:04:50.740> become<00:04:51.040> viable

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
historically week finally become viable

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.370 
historically week finally become viable
and<00:04:51.640> then<00:04:51.760> see<00:04:51.910> us<00:04:52.030> nerf<00:04:52.270> it<00:04:52.450> the<00:04:52.900> key<00:04:53.110> of<00:04:53.230> this

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
and then see us nerf it the key of this

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.530 
and then see us nerf it the key of this
is<00:04:53.560> yeah<00:04:53.920> we<00:04:54.100> did<00:04:54.340> buff<00:04:54.550> him<00:04:54.730> and<00:04:54.940> that's<00:04:55.090> great

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
is yeah we did buff him and that's great

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.720 
is yeah we did buff him and that's great
but<00:04:56.170> the<00:04:56.260> problem<00:04:56.590> was<00:04:56.740> he<00:04:56.980> had<00:04:57.010> previously

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:57.730 
but the problem was he had previously

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.790 
but the problem was he had previously
overpowered<00:04:58.360> things<00:04:58.600> before<00:04:59.110> that<00:04:59.680> were

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
overpowered things before that were

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.350 
overpowered things before that were
never<00:05:00.040> dealt<00:05:00.370> with<00:05:00.520> because<00:05:00.640> he<00:05:00.880> was<00:05:01.030> so<00:05:01.150> weak

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
never dealt with because he was so weak

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.690 
never dealt with because he was so weak
overall<00:05:01.690> weather<00:05:02.590> is<00:05:02.770> a<00:05:02.830> fantastic<00:05:03.340> example

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
overall weather is a fantastic example

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.610 
overall weather is a fantastic example
of<00:05:04.120> this<00:05:04.240> the<00:05:04.600> movement<00:05:04.990> speed<00:05:05.230> slow<00:05:05.440> is

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
of this the movement speed slow is

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.740 
of this the movement speed slow is
ninety-five<00:05:06.340> percent<00:05:06.580> and<00:05:06.970> the<00:05:07.030> auto<00:05:07.270> attack

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
ninety-five percent and the auto attack

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.630 
ninety-five percent and the auto attack
speed<00:05:08.020> slow<00:05:08.260> is<00:05:08.440> also<00:05:09.010> ninety-five<00:05:09.460> percent

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.640 
speed slow is also ninety-five percent

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.850 
speed slow is also ninety-five percent
that's<00:05:10.420> basically<00:05:10.930> a<00:05:11.050> stun<00:05:11.530> for<00:05:11.800> an

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
that's basically a stun for an

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.100 
that's basically a stun for an
auto-attack<00:05:12.190> character<00:05:12.820> what<00:05:13.600> this<00:05:13.750> creates

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
auto-attack character what this creates

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.020 
auto-attack character what this creates
