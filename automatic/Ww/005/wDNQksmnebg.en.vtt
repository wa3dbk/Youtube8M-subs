00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.010
 from apps to it's an expression 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:18.570
 premium c is a luxury model and the beer 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:20.400

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.550

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.949
 or that pretty XP-510 that is fucking in the now 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.449
 you sit at an empty box where you are whole 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.590
 environmentally friendly your ink cartridge 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.250
 lost pots because that goes naturally 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.200
 not in the edges bins beer as a 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.250
 power cable to connect to it 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.530
 Wall outlet 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.239
 so no matter how far away the manual is 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.790
 neatly 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.480
 and a blue ocean in patterned red 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.489
 magenta 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.559
 ink cartridge and photos will be in cartridge 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.000

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.730
 and yellow 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.640
 yellow so all five patterns are 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.640
 also the same with this epson xp-510 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.580

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.540
 to fill and have scanner section 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.360
 underneath the print 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.390
 They then sit in the middle part 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.479
 print part of this printer it is one 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.250
 epsom printing with a pso micro nozzle 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.270
 that is, you are a very small one 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.830
 drop 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.049
 large pepperoni very accurately fine 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.900
 can print details one and a half picoliter 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.700
 with different sizes that guy is 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.920
 need to print flag can make your drops larger 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.159
 make varial size job technology calls 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.930
 apps because it's all about economy 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.220
 and optimum print quality go hand in hand 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.540
 to let go 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.549
 that is a luxury printer and that means 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.290
 he Luxury clariah used 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.220
 and this notion of the printer that is not 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.890
 nauseous 57100 at fourteen hundred dpi 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.460
 so really dry screen what he can 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.920
 to print 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.479
 so you again nice and quick he 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:00.060
 does in men he does 9 pages 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.340
 if you print on plain normal paper 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.680
 start printing in high speed mode 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.439
 can is like 32 pages per minute 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.200
 color printing can be done at its fastest 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.360
 9 pages per minute do one more 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.770
 nice and fast printer 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.290
 The good thing is that the printer is also whole 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.370
 she is quickly ready to use him 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.530
 and he'll be in seconds 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.599
 Ready it not quite a headline 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.010
 quite a bit long he is of course 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.319
 equipped with all wireless technologies 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.209
 we are looking for wifi and epsom these days 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.190
 connex to get one directly from the cloud 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.930
 to print is awfully easy 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.819
 is a device he does not necessarily have 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.830
 Jonah's computer or take it 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.540
 a nice way in the house in the attic in the 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.160
 meter box but the router does not matter 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.040
 true if you are connected to the internet 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.810
 you can make prints from anywhere in the house 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.879
 we will send you your smartphone from your tablet 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.910
 laptop the computer everyone can just 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.230
 wireless printing on this handsome printer 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.930
 Fortunately, you can also use the supplied 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.670
 duplex module purpose there is one 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.800
 all pain does not become extra for sale 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.540
 supplied and the printer has 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.550
 of course also a scanner which I 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.840
 just said is an all-in-one and like us 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.220
 look at the quality of the scanner 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.400
 you should also think of a high one 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.810
 resolution 24100 the twelve hundred dpi 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.060
 to indicate our own eye 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.120
 about 600 dpi so celebrating in 100 with 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.349
 100 that is just super sharp with it 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.180
 you can certainly 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:18.900
 just the highest quality photos 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.220
 feel free to scan paper formats 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.110
 so you all have a bit of gallians 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.209
 you can make one-tenth 15 photo prints 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.799
 but it also just becomes techniques 18 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.940
 15 and 20 and a4 format 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:31.170
 photo paper envelopes everything is in it 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.099
 this apps and surrounding is in terms of 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.709
 Specifications 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:36.269
 filled all the way to the top as more 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.480
 want then we need a luxury models 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.480
 look 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.320
 This XP-510 is suitable for people who 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.540
 are looking for a man but everyone 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.610
 also want to be able to print wirelessly and 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.860
 of course also want double sided 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.630
 be able to print with that duplex module 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.890
 and people that thrift are important 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.350
 the printer doesn't find much in it 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.100
 wasted but prince and frugal in it 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.320
 use 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.910
 because you separate per app cartridges 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.650
 color is like none is up you only need 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.440
 but money to replace you is not a block 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.090
 with red and yellow bluescreen to know 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.730
 that you should case them all tasty 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.320
 modest patterns that is more economical than 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.150
 people who print a lot can do that too 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.100
 well this xp-510 is right because there are 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.040
 two types of patterns have a normal one 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.900
 siri 26 patterns easily said 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.270
 polar bear everyone's pattern has an animal 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.080
 as a picture with this is the polar bear with 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.230
 bottom 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.150
 xl polar bear and xl 26 pattern 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.190
 an extra wind through which you 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.230
 can print even cheaper if you buy a lot 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.300
 using your sprinter is handy 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.290
 to choose that xl pattern 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.610
 you can just do it here 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.990
 use so you can just say your point 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.090
 from texas do kind 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.710
 nice xl I know few pictures 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.690
 I think you do n't use many colors 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.610
 normal pattern 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.900
 if you can make a copy like that at home 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.060
 if you have a print we just have that 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.430
 Standalone can work without the PC 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.440
 you can indicate via the display with 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.660
 you can simply operate the buttons without 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.830
 put the computer on ideally 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.780
 no waiting for windows once 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.390
 finished booting is not waiting until 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.950
 your apple pc started no hatsikidee 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.870
 just turned on the epson printer and 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:10.380
 equal copy print scan 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:13.230
 everything this printer is ease of use 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:17.120
 work wirelessly and print on both sides 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.120
 completely in a compact nice jacket 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.080
 well the printer extensively tested well photo 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.180
 qualities logical so it is an epsom 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.610
 that is just as thick as epsom is 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.820
 king of the printers and that they are 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.990
 not for nothing an epson print 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.730
 most beautiful other brand can do it very well 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.940
 very nice groups try my apps 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.950
 really print the best scanner quality 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.600
 also super good also that moss nice and fast 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.370
 so too good to talk about 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.350
 it connects the window is one 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.820
 The device network is to be a super 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.950
 easy with more i three phone 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:51.830
 Wireless works everyone can 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.420
 really true if we are critical we look 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.650
 to the disadvantages then I thought it was a pity 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.960
 that there is none 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.640
 memory card can and that I can 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.290
 The front does not have a USB port you have 

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.450
 to connect a photo camera like me 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.250
 want to print a photo from the camera 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.210
 must first have your computer 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.500
 boot up 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.210
 and then use the printer 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.280
 there are even more luxury models for that 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.990
 but you can insert the memory card 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.670
 the USB connection itself for the 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.720
 remain this xp-510 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.720
 really a super printer
