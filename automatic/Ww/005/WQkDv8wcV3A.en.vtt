00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.690
 physical resemblance a small side rio

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.159

 me to meet them because it's in 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.580
 as a football fan it's a 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.320
 these two great football specialists 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.340
 I am always attentive to them 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.450
 analyzes that are very cool and so that 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.770
 I do not like it and I am very very 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.930
 very happy to meet them 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.119
 I was I was contacted by a 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.369
 official forum moderator who told me 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.750
 asked if I wanted to participate in this 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.200
 little experience and then I accepted 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.539
 with pleasure 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.039
 well we will see what they are going to me 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:03.539
 say we are going to maybe have more one 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:04.979
 outside notice on the thing I have 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:07.560
 maybe more of a gamer opinion so we 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.709
 will be able to confront our two opinions and 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:14.519
 see what it gives stone daniel I 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.560
 present series the year with his little 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.269
 team had to also is ours 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.430
 introduce his team was he said he 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.500
 that she is super strong excellent she 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.340
 is super come from this normal liga and 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.230
 100% - the suitcases and sends them in 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.940
 motorcycle produced a team in 3 5 2 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.970
 very powerful formations in the game 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.350
 whose goals you have manual neuter 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.900
 Monday then in central defense naldo 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.070
 and the case for the height and the case 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.070
 physical power 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.310
 the awt santana of the high jump not the 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.829
 cut 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.609
 adacore outgoing president alain it's a 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.250
 darlings the game huh 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.959
 it's a darling a very player 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.269
 very used but the speed 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.100
 would become visa in addition to thistle go 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:57.989
 I had you this rise also touches 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:59.430
 yeah then on to boateng wayne jones 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.019
 already I would have played four behind 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.400
 a pseudo back up the bayern plays at 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.140
 four behind it is going very well 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.670
 formations at 4 are also a lot 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.069
 used but the 3-5-2 is a 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.180
 training in the game that is located 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.750
 whatever you want what why 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.040
 Why 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.090
 or is it very compact 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.030
 in lax and it's one of the few 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.349
 formations there are two defensive midfielders 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.409
 so there is very little space in lax 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:21.629
 we are entitled that we are born we have the right right 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:24.390
 rails and to play football you play 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:26.519
 as in low added throughout the 3-5-2 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.780
 it's super explosive like training it 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.480
 there are guys on the wings there are guys 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.650
 in the lf excellent taste side exposed 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.739
 our tastes at the universities and I 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.569
 wanted to spend there in wood is 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.299
 that the little dutch think it arrow 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.500
 pretty fast technique was 100 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.090
 authors just now you have 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.409
 your 100m so it's the athlete in 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:48.810
 will equip the body will say yes it is 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:51.030
 made to gallop then one to shaqiri to 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.010
 right so a guy who plays pakistan the 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:57.239
 bench that not bad hockey that will be brought 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:04:00.409
 to play the grammatical rule 1-1 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.409
 shakiri shakira 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.069
 then we attacked midfielder I opted 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:08.680
 for this normal it's good in this 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.970
 fog in front of you have the good backs that 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.830
 here is what we can read many times 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.020
 this is good I explain them we 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.260
 what is the baltringue leaves enough and 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.700
 swing a strong German first and 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.989
 I do not know him very well either 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.750
 but his stats on the map that have me 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.130
 rained you make yourself do it with a team 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.020
 a few master is a guy who plays 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.669
 not a guy you do not know she's 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.600
 clean it was here you see it's more 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:30.730
 that it was going well 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.470
 we choose another team we were 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.880
 quiet I'll almost succeed in the 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:38.350
 put in a good mood by yves patatras 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.210
 it's not at the same time I'm trying to 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.520
 to adapt to the game is the game that wants 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.530
 it was played at the happy game that you 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.150
 Mettes guys you know not as 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.660
 for example last year I'm going 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.070
 to discover 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.570
 yeah for example last year the 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.840
 judge discovered last year el 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:55.000
 shaarawy if this year explodes a 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.260
 last year in the game it was a 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.190
 little bomb at the same time this is the 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.180
 fall principle 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.979
 if we want to play with eagles 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:05.590
 prophecies of the multimed team escape 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:06.700
 yes, well, listen, we can choose 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:11.140
 players to make teams at this 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:12.250
 rich and very nice your most you are you 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.910
 change of three players you will keep 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:18.039
 that a few days ago that josiane 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.030
 donald wade and free naldo and french fries 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:21.910
 it's true that I could put but 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.560
 this is so even if in a defense to 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.450
 three you could never have 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.370
 do a medley dortmund bayern as 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.419
 the two best 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.710
 no but the long duration in the 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:29.850
 now but he wanted to do the 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.040
 mariole take players that we 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.660
 do not know fortuna düsseldorf time 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.880
 ex with children to be with you 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.380
 see if we make a pleasure you wanted 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.780
 impress us a little bit and you 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.310
 go and you are with the sionge with that with 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.410
 that I had not you agree we will 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:46.790
 see it's not the only referees 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:48.750
 do not have any problems in the sunny days 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.669
 these fifteen days for that we play that 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:53.699
 both really I 'm going to train 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:59.910
 I took the risk of hurting you or 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:06:00.960
 the challenge that launches you very nice as I 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:04.199
 I expected it a little bit 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:07.470
 attack by stone lead - by daniel 

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:09.090
 so very good experience and then we have 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.919
 could compare our opinion it was enough 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:12.180
 Nice I saw that my opinion 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:14.820
 diverged a little bit of oil on 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:18.090
 some points of which care it allowed 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:20.010
 to see the differences in fact they have 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:22.470
 their definite opinion about the thing 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:24.060
 after that football is really a mode 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.250
 different game of reality does not see 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.600
 more like it compared to reality 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.979
 like for example the formations the 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.930
 3-5-2 sure it's actually a 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:33.090
 almost never used training I believe 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.220
 except perhaps the juve of times he 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.539
 plays in this device not so that 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.970
 in the game it's a training that is 

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:39.990
 maybe one of the most used so 

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:41.880
 after it's true their opinion is 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.810
 really different from mine on May 9th 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.520
 he may not have been wrong on 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.419
 some things about some players there 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.039
 there may be some small changes 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:48.630
 to do especially in defense and in 

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:50.550
 wolf attack where I could put some 

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:51.780
 players perform better than that 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.389
 I had put like for example but you 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.830
 put in place of naldo and in attack 

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:56.250
 I can put racer instead of 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.220
 the story 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:00.419
 we will already know more mouth than the 

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.500
 players that I had put so I 

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:03.960
 also take advantage to make a small 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:06.960
 dedication to the fake fifa xiii ultimate 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:10.650
 team managed by peschio myself nomads 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:12.860
 archi and all the clique and see you soon 

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:12.860
 guys
