00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.400 

yeah<00:04:22.000> so<00:04:23.000> I<00:04:23.030> have<00:04:23.300> that<00:04:23.510> tester<00:04:23.960> that<00:04:24.139> means<00:04:24.290> my

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
yeah so I have that tester that means my

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.500 
yeah so I have that tester that means my
dryer<00:04:24.740> isn't<00:04:25.130> bad<00:04:25.310> because<00:04:26.030> it<00:04:26.180> still<00:04:26.360> has

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
dryer isn't bad because it still has

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.850 
dryer isn't bad because it still has
pressure<00:04:27.520> but<00:04:28.520> I<00:04:29.139> don't<00:04:30.139> have<00:04:30.290> a<00:04:30.320> belt<00:04:30.560> for<00:04:30.710> my

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
pressure but I don't have a belt for my

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.060 
pressure but I don't have a belt for my
compressor<00:04:31.760> and<00:04:32.290> i<00:04:33.290> might<00:04:33.470> go<00:04:33.650> get<00:04:33.860> one<00:04:34.040> and

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
compressor and i might go get one and

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.400 
compressor and i might go get one and
tested<00:04:34.699> but<00:04:34.820> i'm<00:04:35.030> thinking<00:04:35.510> probably<00:04:35.660> there

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
tested but i'm thinking probably there

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.810 
tested but i'm thinking probably there
was<00:04:36.500> a<00:04:36.530> reason<00:04:36.740> why<00:04:36.949> to<00:04:37.010> remove<00:04:37.340> the<00:04:37.460> belt<00:04:37.610> off

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820

more pick up I don't know I think it's

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:35.129 
more pick up I don't know I think it's
because<00:06:33.230> I<00:06:33.440> had<00:06:33.740> a<00:06:33.770> larger<00:06:34.220> tire<00:06:34.520> on<00:06:34.820> the<00:06:34.940> front

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:35.139 
because I had a larger tire on the front

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:38.740 
because I had a larger tire on the front
my<00:06:36.139> spare<00:06:36.470> is<00:06:36.500> larger<00:06:37.040> for<00:06:37.070> some<00:06:37.370> reason<00:06:37.690> so<00:06:38.690> i

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:38.750 
my spare is larger for some reason so i

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.189 
my spare is larger for some reason so i
