which<00:00:02.790> we<00:00:03.060> call<00:00:03.300> the<00:00:03.720> turn<00:00:05.180> it<00:00:06.180> has<00:00:06.660> a<00:00:06.690> similar

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
which we call the turn it has a similar

which we call the turn it has a similar
structure<00:00:07.589> line<00:00:08.280> 1<00:00:08.760> and<00:00:09.059> line<00:00:09.469> 3<00:00:10.469> or<00:00:10.650> 7<00:00:11.090> so<00:00:12.090> once

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.650 

WOB<00:00:43.829> up<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.129> line<00:00:44.280> three<00:00:44.579> right<00:00:44.820> same<00:00:45.420> thing

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
WOB up the line three right same thing

00:00:45.660 --> 00:01:00.160 
WOB up the line three right same thing
as<00:00:45.780> line<00:00:45.989> one<00:00:51.050> I<00:00:52.550> know<00:00:53.550> at<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.120> last<00:00:54.269> line

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.750 

whatever<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.469> go<00:01:01.649> really<00:01:02.070> slow<00:01:02.339> like<00:01:02.579> I'm

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
whatever you go really slow like I'm

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.700 
whatever you go really slow like I'm
doing<00:01:03.000> right<00:01:03.089> now<00:01:03.149> it's<00:01:03.570> it's<00:01:03.960> really<00:01:04.199> easy<00:01:04.500> to

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
doing right now it's it's really easy to

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.370 
doing right now it's it's really easy to
get<00:01:04.860> lost<00:01:06.830> so<00:01:08.299> what<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.330> want<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.659> do<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.990> play<00:01:10.350> it

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
get lost so what I want to do is play it

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.850 
get lost so what I want to do is play it
up<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.799> speed<00:01:11.210> but<00:01:12.210> understand<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.649> have

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
up to speed but understand that you have

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.290 
up to speed but understand that you have
to<00:01:14.039> you<00:01:14.220> have<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.429> you<00:01:14.580> have<00:01:14.759> to<00:01:14.880> kind<00:01:15.149> of<00:01:15.179> be

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
to you have to you have to kind of be

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.180 
to you have to you have to kind of be
able<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.539> work<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.929> meant<00:01:16.440> for<00:01:16.560> many<00:01:16.860> different

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
able to work it meant for many different

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.550 
able to work it meant for many different
angles<00:01:17.340> like<00:01:17.759> an<00:01:17.940> artist<00:01:18.330> does<00:01:18.570> sometimes<00:01:19.409> you

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
angles like an artist does sometimes you

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.290 
angles like an artist does sometimes you
have<00:01:19.679> to<00:01:19.800> get<00:01:19.950> real<00:01:20.159> close<00:01:20.190> to<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.759> canvas<00:01:21.149> and

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
have to get real close to the canvas and

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.669 
have to get real close to the canvas and
sometimes<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.720> have<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.960> step<00:01:22.170> back

00:01:22.669 --> 00:01:22.679 
sometimes you have to step back

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:25.490 
sometimes you have to step back
this<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.280> stepping<00:01:23.729> back<00:01:23.940> in<00:01:24.179> and<00:01:24.479> this<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.350> it

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
this is stepping back in and this is it

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.919 
this is stepping back in and this is it
you<00:01:25.619> may<00:01:25.740> not<00:01:25.920> may<00:01:26.909> not<00:01:27.090> be<00:01:27.179> able<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.420> follow<00:01:27.630> it

00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:27.929 
you may not may not be able to follow it

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:31.399 
you may not may not be able to follow it
all<00:01:28.110> if<00:01:28.500> it's<00:01:28.649> Newton<00:01:29.190> but<00:01:30.080> you'll<00:01:31.080> get<00:01:31.319> it

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
all if it's Newton but you'll get it

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:50.010 
all if it's Newton but you'll get it
eventually<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.920> was<00:01:32.130> like<00:01:32.280> this

important to get in your head at that
speed<00:02:06.460> it's<00:02:06.700> easy<00:02:06.880> to<00:02:07.060> get<00:02:07.210> into<00:02:07.330> your<00:02:07.540> head

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780

because you haven't heard this five

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.010 
because you haven't heard this five
million<00:02:32.800> times<00:02:32.980> yet<00:02:33.460> if<00:02:34.180> you<00:02:34.390> hear<00:02:34.660> it<00:02:34.810> over

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
million times yet if you hear it over

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.100 
million times yet if you hear it over
and<00:02:35.440> over<00:02:35.680> again<00:02:35.740> at<00:02:36.100> a<00:02:36.430> moderate<00:02:37.120> rate<00:02:37.450> of

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
and over again at a moderate rate of

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.680 
and over again at a moderate rate of
speed<00:02:38.410> you<00:02:39.190> get<00:02:39.430> it<00:02:39.520> in<00:02:39.610> your<00:02:39.700> head<00:02:39.940> then<00:02:40.450> when

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
speed you get it in your head then when

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.270 
speed you get it in your head then when
you<00:02:40.780> come<00:02:40.990> back<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.410> slowing<00:02:41.770> it<00:02:41.890> down<00:02:41.920> it's

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
you come back to slowing it down it's

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.520 
you come back to slowing it down it's
going<00:02:42.370> to<00:02:42.430> make<00:02:42.610> a<00:02:42.880> whole<00:02:43.270> lot<00:02:43.450> of<00:02:43.600> sense<00:02:43.780> so

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530
