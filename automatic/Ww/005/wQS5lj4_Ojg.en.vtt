00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
awesome because I think this is one of

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.980 
awesome because I think this is one of
the<00:00:12.929> best<00:00:13.590> pickup<00:00:13.980> rook<00:00:14.250> jobs<00:00:14.549> that<00:00:15.330> I<00:00:15.660> have

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
the best pickup rook jobs that I have

the best pickup rook jobs that I have
ever<00:00:16.350> done

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
ever done

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.160 
ever done
I<00:00:18.380> definitely<00:00:19.380> packed<00:00:19.800> more<00:00:20.699> than<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.539> this

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
I definitely packed more than and this

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.620 
I definitely packed more than and this
is<00:00:22.380> just<00:00:22.619> an<00:00:22.769> estimate<00:00:23.090> but<00:00:24.090> probably<00:00:24.420> more

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
is just an estimate but probably more

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.500 
is just an estimate but probably more
than<00:00:24.840> two<00:00:24.990> thousand<00:00:25.650> bricks<00:00:25.890> in<00:00:26.189> two<00:00:27.000> just

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
than two thousand bricks in two just

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.470 
than two thousand bricks in two just
this<00:00:27.990> one<00:00:28.789> including<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.910> little<00:00:30.060> stud

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
ton of pieces you could get the same

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.340 
ton of pieces you could get the same
amount<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.620> pieces<00:00:38.489> for<00:00:39.149> two<00:00:39.420> hundred<00:00:39.750> dollars

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.729 
in a Lego set but you know that's just
an<00:00:44.670> estimate<00:00:45.270> facing<00:00:45.930> off<00:00:46.079> all<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.500> pieces

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
an estimate facing off all the pieces

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.260 
an estimate facing off all the pieces
that<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:47.190> got<00:00:47.520> but<00:00:48.649> yes<00:00:49.649> so<00:00:49.920> if<00:00:50.129> we<00:00:50.280> take<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.550> look

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.920 
further you can see that there is a ton
of<00:00:56.160> pieces<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.899> could<00:00:58.109> see<00:00:59.239> the<00:01:00.239> outside

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
of pieces and you could see the outside

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.700 
of pieces and you could see the outside
right<00:01:01.230> there<00:01:01.879> was<00:01:03.049> packed<00:01:04.049> with<00:01:04.909> those<00:01:06.710> black

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
how packed this is this isn't just this

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.670 
how packed this is this isn't just this
black<00:01:38.310> piece<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:39.329> whole<00:01:39.360> entire<00:01:39.750> way<00:01:39.960> let<00:01:40.590> me

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
black piece the whole entire way let me

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.179 
black piece the whole entire way let me
just<00:01:40.740> focus<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.490> in<00:01:41.640> there<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:41.970> little<00:01:42.090> bit

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
just focus it in there a little bit

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:44.690 
just focus it in there a little bit
there<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.220> go

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
there you go

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.359 
there you go
and<00:01:45.140> so<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.229> can<00:01:46.470> see<00:01:46.649> all<00:01:46.860> those<00:01:47.100> black

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
and so you can see all those black

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.780 
and so you can see all those black
pieces<00:01:47.939> but<00:01:48.720> there<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.380> ton<00:01:49.860> more<00:01:50.220> inside<00:01:50.759> of

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
pieces but there is a ton more inside of

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.330 
pieces but there is a ton more inside of
there<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:51.720> if<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:51.990> open<00:01:52.259> this<00:01:52.380> up<00:01:52.590> it's<00:01:53.189> even

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
there so if I open this up it's even

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.569 
there so if I open this up it's even
packed<00:01:53.759> on<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.180> top<00:01:55.250> and<00:01:57.229> look<00:01:58.229> at<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.579> it

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
packed on the top and look at that it

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.230 
packed on the top and look at that it
doesn't<00:02:00.240> even<00:02:00.299> come<00:02:00.659> out<00:02:01.640> this<00:02:02.640> whole<00:02:02.909> entire

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
doesn't even come out this whole entire

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.730 
doesn't even come out this whole entire
thing<00:02:03.299> is<00:02:03.990> packed<00:02:04.860> with<00:02:05.250> two<00:02:06.000> by<00:02:06.210> two<00:02:06.270> bricks

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
thing is packed with two by two bricks

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.690 
thing is packed with two by two bricks
right<00:02:07.740> here<00:02:09.470> so<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:11.039> what<00:02:11.310> is<00:02:11.489> in<00:02:11.670> the

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
right here so that is what is in the

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.920 
right here so that is what is in the
middle<00:02:12.120> and

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
middle and

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.259 
middle and
I<00:02:12.959> used<00:02:13.319> these<00:02:13.950> a<00:02:14.010> little<00:02:14.640> tiny<00:02:14.879> 1<00:02:15.239> 1<00:02:15.719> by<00:02:15.900> 1<00:02:17.269> flat

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
I used these a little tiny 1 1 by 1 flat

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.599 
I used these a little tiny 1 1 by 1 flat
studs<00:02:19.019> I<00:02:19.170> think<00:02:19.409> you<00:02:19.500> would<00:02:19.620> call<00:02:19.829> them<00:02:20.040> to

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:20.609 
studs I think you would call them to

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:22.640 
studs I think you would call them to
fill<00:02:20.849> in<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.090> little<00:02:21.239> cracks<00:02:21.689> in<00:02:22.019> there<00:02:22.260> and

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
fill in the little cracks in there and

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.399 
fill in the little cracks in there and
if<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.549> put<00:02:23.790> both<00:02:23.939> of<00:02:24.000> these<00:02:24.269> pieces<00:02:24.599> back<00:02:25.049> and

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
if I put both of these pieces back and

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:29.179 
if I put both of these pieces back and
just<00:02:25.590> um<00:02:25.920> shake<00:02:26.879> it<00:02:27.060> up<00:02:27.209> a<00:02:27.329> little<00:02:27.510> bit<00:02:28.099> let<00:02:29.099> me

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:29.189

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
thing I also got a few of these pieces

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.730 
thing I also got a few of these pieces
right<00:05:16.590> here<00:05:16.650> that<00:05:17.490> will<00:05:17.610> focus<00:05:17.940> this<00:05:18.270> in

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
right here that will focus this in

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.550 
right here that will focus this in
alright<00:05:19.770> so<00:05:20.130> this<00:05:20.550> piece<00:05:20.850> right<00:05:21.180> here<00:05:21.240> I<00:05:21.840> just

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
alright so this piece right here I just

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.010 
alright so this piece right here I just
saw<00:05:22.890> this<00:05:23.420> it<00:05:24.440> is<00:05:25.440> a<00:05:25.470> transparent<00:05:26.540> orange<00:05:27.540> tea

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
saw this it is a transparent orange tea

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.920 
saw this it is a transparent orange tea
slope<00:05:28.470> and<00:05:28.830> I<00:05:29.670> thought<00:05:30.000> that<00:05:30.240> this<00:05:30.420> would<00:05:30.600> be

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
slope and I thought that this would be

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.850 
slope and I thought that this would be
really<00:05:31.410> really<00:05:31.590> good<00:05:32.040> for<00:05:32.310> some<00:05:33.090> explosions

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
really really good for some explosions

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.080 
really really good for some explosions
so<00:05:34.860> I<00:05:34.890> thought<00:05:35.220> I'd<00:05:35.340> just<00:05:35.520> give<00:05:35.730> you<00:05:35.880> guys<00:05:36.060> a

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
so I thought I'd just give you guys a

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.930 
so I thought I'd just give you guys a
little<00:05:36.300> tip<00:05:36.660> there<00:05:37.100> it<00:05:38.100> kind<00:05:38.430> of<00:05:38.520> makes<00:05:38.730> it

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
little tip there it kind of makes it

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.360 
little tip there it kind of makes it
look<00:05:39.150> like<00:05:39.180> you<00:05:39.570> know<00:05:39.750> it's<00:05:40.410> curving<00:05:41.010> up<00:05:41.160> like

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
look like you know it's curving up like

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.240 
look like you know it's curving up like
going<00:05:42.200> do<00:05:43.200> you<00:05:43.290> guys<00:05:43.440> know<00:05:43.620> what<00:05:43.740> I<00:05:43.770> mean

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
going do you guys know what I mean

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.040 
going do you guys know what I mean
if<00:05:44.460> you<00:05:44.700> like<00:05:44.880> take<00:05:45.120> a<00:05:45.150> look<00:05:45.450> at<00:05:45.630> explosions

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
if you like take a look at explosions

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.770 
if you like take a look at explosions
and<00:05:46.770> stuff<00:05:47.010> you<00:05:47.190> know<00:05:47.310> it<00:05:47.790> kind<00:05:48.000> of<00:05:48.090> curves<00:05:48.390> up

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
and stuff you know it kind of curves up

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.540 
and stuff you know it kind of curves up
a<00:05:48.930> little<00:05:49.110> bit<00:05:49.410> and<00:05:49.890> I<00:05:49.919> thought<00:05:50.100> that<00:05:50.310> piece

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
a little bit and I thought that piece

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:51.740 
a little bit and I thought that piece
would<00:05:50.760> be<00:05:50.820> perfect

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 
would be perfect

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.440 
would be perfect
since<00:05:52.230> it<00:05:52.380> was<00:05:52.500> in<00:05:52.680> trance<00:05:53.450> transparent

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.450 
since it was in trance transparent

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.860 
since it was in trance transparent
orange<00:05:55.190> so<00:05:56.190> yeah<00:05:56.520> and<00:05:56.850> then<00:05:57.030> there's<00:05:57.510> just

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
orange so yeah and then there's just

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.950 
orange so yeah and then there's just
this<00:05:58.350> cup<00:05:59.180> pretty<00:06:00.180> awesome

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
this cup pretty awesome

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.710 
this cup pretty awesome
and<00:06:01.760> the<00:06:02.760> Bionicle<00:06:04.400> so<00:06:05.400> that<00:06:05.820> was<00:06:06.090> really<00:06:06.450> it

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
and the Bionicle so that was really it

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.260
