as you see compared to the other one the
wash<00:02:06.189> has<00:02:06.670> started<00:02:06.909> to<00:02:07.000> come<00:02:07.149> off<00:02:07.299> of<00:02:07.479> the<00:02:07.570> skin

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
wash has started to come off of the skin

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.330 
wash has started to come off of the skin
and<00:02:08.200> like<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:09.190> leather<00:02:09.580> areas<00:02:10.000> and<00:02:10.479> even<00:02:11.050> the

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
and like the leather areas and even the

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.820 
and like the leather areas and even the
metal<00:02:12.340> dry<00:02:12.640> brushed<00:02:12.910> areas<00:02:13.410> are<00:02:14.410> starting<00:02:14.620> to

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
metal dry brushed areas are starting to

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.550 
metal dry brushed areas are starting to
lose<00:02:15.360> some<00:02:16.360> of<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.540> wash<00:02:16.720> as<00:02:16.930> well<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:20.380> pain

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
lose some of the wash as well the pain

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.970 
lose some of the wash as well the pain
also<00:02:20.769> will<00:02:21.040> look<00:02:21.280> a<00:02:21.400> lot<00:02:21.580> softer<00:02:21.970> and<00:02:22.739> I<00:02:23.739> can

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
also will look a lot softer and I can

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.449 
also will look a lot softer and I can
probably<00:02:24.250> just<00:02:24.550> take<00:02:25.360> my<00:02:25.540> finger<00:02:25.959> and<00:02:29.459> just

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
probably just take my finger and just

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.729 
probably just take my finger and just
rub<00:02:30.760> it<00:02:30.790> across<00:02:31.000> there<00:02:31.450> gently<00:02:31.780> you<00:02:32.440> see<00:02:32.650> the

just<00:04:31.600> a<00:04:31.690> couple<00:04:31.870> days<00:04:32.110> ago<00:04:33.060> we'll<00:04:34.060> go<00:04:34.120> ahead

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
just a couple days ago we'll go ahead

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.650 
just a couple days ago we'll go ahead
and<00:04:34.360> take<00:04:34.450> a<00:04:34.480> closer<00:04:34.720> look<00:04:34.870> so<00:04:35.110> you<00:04:35.170> can<00:04:35.350> see

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
and take a closer look so you can see

00:04:36.660 --> 00:05:07.950 
and take a closer look so you can see
that<00:04:41.820> the<00:04:42.820> models<00:04:43.090> are<00:04:43.210> really<00:04:43.450> really<00:04:43.900> clean

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.320 

there's<00:05:08.949> so<00:05:09.220> a<00:05:09.250> little<00:05:09.639> bit<00:05:09.759> pain<00:05:09.940> left<00:05:10.150> on

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
there's so a little bit pain left on

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.480 
there's so a little bit pain left on
this<00:05:10.479> guy<00:05:10.690> I<00:05:12.360> can<00:05:13.360> go<00:05:13.479> back<00:05:14.220> probably<00:05:15.220> just<00:05:15.340> let

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
this guy I can go back probably just let

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.790 
this guy I can go back probably just let
him<00:05:15.750> send<00:05:16.750> some<00:05:16.990> simple<00:05:17.259> green<00:05:17.410> for<00:05:17.620> another

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
him send some simple green for another

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.650 
him send some simple green for another
day<00:05:17.979> or<00:05:18.009> so<00:05:18.160> then<00:05:18.970> come<00:05:19.180> back<00:05:19.210> with<00:05:19.509> that

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
day or so then come back with that

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.400 
day or so then come back with that
smaller<00:05:20.259> brush<00:05:20.560> and<00:05:20.590> get<00:05:20.860> all<00:05:20.979> that<00:05:21.009> out<00:05:22.410> but

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
smaller brush and get all that out but

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.340 
smaller brush and get all that out but
to<00:05:23.889> be<00:05:23.979> honest<00:05:24.449> it's<00:05:25.449> up<00:05:25.539> to<00:05:25.660> you<00:05:25.810> I<00:05:25.840> mean<00:05:26.020> a

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
to be honest it's up to you I mean a

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.230 
to be honest it's up to you I mean a
little<00:05:27.009> bit<00:05:27.130> of<00:05:27.220> coat<00:05:27.370> of<00:05:27.460> primer<00:05:27.580> will<00:05:28.060> cover

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
little bit of coat of primer will cover

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.210 
little bit of coat of primer will cover
that<00:05:28.389> right<00:05:28.570> up<00:05:30.360> so<00:05:31.360> it's<00:05:31.539> really<00:05:32.220> your

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
that right up so it's really your

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.529 
that right up so it's really your
discretion<00:05:33.759> but<00:05:34.860> to<00:05:35.860> be<00:05:35.949> honest<00:05:36.280> I<00:05:36.550> think<00:05:37.270> this

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:37.539 
discretion but to be honest I think this

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:39.210 
discretion but to be honest I think this
is<00:05:37.660> a<00:05:37.690> really<00:05:38.080> good<00:05:38.199> starting<00:05:38.650> point<00:05:38.919> for<00:05:39.039> a

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
is a really good starting point for a

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:59.689 
is a really good starting point for a
brand<00:05:39.520> new<00:05:39.610> paint<00:05:39.820> job

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240
