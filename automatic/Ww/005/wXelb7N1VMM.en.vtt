great<00:02:22.569> because<00:02:22.750> they<00:02:22.989> really<00:02:23.260> do<00:02:23.410> keep<00:02:23.620> the

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
great because they really do keep the

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.650 
great because they really do keep the
oil<00:02:23.950> from<00:02:24.190> popping<00:02:24.580> up<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:24.940> it<00:02:25.120> also<00:02:25.269> helps

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
oil from popping up and it also helps

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.430 
oil from popping up and it also helps
create<00:02:25.780> a<00:02:25.930> really<00:02:26.140> clean<00:02:26.349> work<00:02:26.560> surface<00:02:28.440> so

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440
