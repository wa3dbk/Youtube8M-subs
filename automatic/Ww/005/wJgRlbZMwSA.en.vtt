started<00:00:48.429> by<00:00:48.550> taking<00:00:48.699> a<00:00:48.879> look<00:00:48.969> at<00:00:49.089> some<00:00:49.239> of

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
started by taking a look at some of

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:50.639 
started by taking a look at some of
these<00:00:49.390> pieces<00:00:49.629> that<00:00:49.839> we<00:00:50.050> have<00:00:50.199> sitting<00:00:50.379> on<00:00:50.589> the

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:50.649 
these pieces that we have sitting on the

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:52.889 
these pieces that we have sitting on the
bench<00:00:50.829> right<00:00:51.010> now<00:00:51.190> when<00:00:51.789> really<00:00:52.389> pushing<00:00:52.809> the

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 
bench right now when really pushing the

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:54.930 
bench right now when really pushing the
limits<00:00:53.199> of<00:00:53.350> the<00:00:53.499> 400<00:00:53.979> Polaris<00:00:54.339> we<00:00:54.489> have<00:00:54.670> found

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
limits of the 400 Polaris we have found

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.450 
limits of the 400 Polaris we have found
there<00:00:55.239> are<00:00:55.389> some<00:00:55.600> shortcomings<00:00:56.109> to<00:00:56.530> a<00:00:56.739> few<00:00:57.370> of

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
there are some shortcomings to a few of

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.149 
there are some shortcomings to a few of
the<00:00:57.550> parts<00:00:57.729> on<00:00:57.999> there<00:00:58.440> cases<00:00:59.440> and<00:00:59.739> cylinders

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:00.159 
the parts on there cases and cylinders

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:02.069 
the parts on there cases and cylinders
to<00:01:00.280> be<00:01:00.370> exactly<00:01:00.850> what<00:01:01.269> I<00:01:01.299> have<00:01:01.479> here<00:01:01.690> is<00:01:01.780> a<00:01:01.809> pair

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 
to be exactly what I have here is a pair

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.910 
to be exactly what I have here is a pair
of<00:01:02.109> klaris<00:01:02.920> 400<00:01:03.460> L<00:01:03.639> cylinders<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:05.470> one<00:01:05.710> is

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
of klaris 400 L cylinders this one is

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.110 
of klaris 400 L cylinders this one is
off<00:01:06.370> of<00:01:06.400> a<00:01:06.670> 1994<00:01:07.630> or<00:01:07.870> a<00:01:07.900> 1995<00:01:08.890> Polaris<00:01:09.430> 400<00:01:10.000> L

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 
off of a 1994 or a 1995 Polaris 400 L

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.820 
off of a 1994 or a 1995 Polaris 400 L
you<00:01:10.960> can<00:01:11.080> tell<00:01:11.230> the<00:01:11.350> difference<00:01:11.710> between

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
you can tell the difference between

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.710 
you can tell the difference between
these<00:01:12.160> early<00:01:12.550> and<00:01:12.670> late<00:01:12.790> style<00:01:13.090> cylinders<00:01:13.570> by

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
these early and late style cylinders by

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.470 
these early and late style cylinders by
two<00:01:13.780> things<00:01:14.200> one<00:01:14.920> the<00:01:15.550> addition<00:01:15.910> of<00:01:16.000> ports<00:01:16.360> in

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:16.480 
two things one the addition of ports in

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.450 
two things one the addition of ports in
the<00:01:16.510> later<00:01:16.750> model<00:01:17.170> that<00:01:17.620> go<00:01:17.770> up<00:01:17.980> into<00:01:18.160> the

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
the later model that go up into the

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.820 
the later model that go up into the
intakes<00:01:18.880> up<00:01:19.150> to<00:01:19.330> the<00:01:19.450> transfers<00:01:20.020> the<00:01:20.560> earlier

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
intakes up to the transfers the earlier

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.590 
intakes up to the transfers the earlier
models<00:01:21.220> as<00:01:21.370> you<00:01:21.490> can<00:01:21.610> see<00:01:21.760> did<00:01:22.030> not<00:01:22.180> have<00:01:22.420> those

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
models as you can see did not have those

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.780 
models as you can see did not have those
ports<00:01:23.050> in<00:01:23.230> them<00:01:23.410> another<00:01:24.130> difference<00:01:24.700> that

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
ports in them another difference that

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.280 
ports in them another difference that
you<00:01:25.030> can<00:01:25.150> tell<00:01:25.330> between<00:01:25.540> these<00:01:25.840> early<00:01:26.050> and

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
you can tell between these early and

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.260 
you can tell between these early and
late<00:01:26.410> style<00:01:26.710> cylinders<00:01:27.190> is<00:01:27.610> the<00:01:27.790> angle<00:01:28.150> at

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
late style cylinders is the angle at

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.600 
late style cylinders is the angle at
which<00:01:28.300> the<00:01:28.450> reed<00:01:28.780> cage<00:01:29.050> goes<00:01:29.890> on<00:01:30.250> to<00:01:30.490> the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
which the reed cage goes on to the

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.060 
which the reed cage goes on to the
machine<00:01:30.870> as<00:01:31.870> you<00:01:32.140> can<00:01:32.230> see<00:01:32.410> this<00:01:32.560> one<00:01:32.740> goes<00:01:32.890> on

is this is the early style model it will
