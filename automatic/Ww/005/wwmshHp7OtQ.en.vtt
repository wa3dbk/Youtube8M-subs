00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
with the product I don't go too heavy

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.779 
with the product I don't go too heavy
because<00:01:00.120> um<00:01:00.680> at<00:01:01.680> first<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.070> used<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.370> use<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> lot

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
because um at first I used to use a lot

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.820 
because um at first I used to use a lot
and<00:01:03.090> then<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:03.570> would<00:01:03.809> have<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.960> lot<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.229> excess

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
and then I would have a lot of excess

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.880 
and then I would have a lot of excess
which<00:01:05.070> pretty<00:01:05.339> much<00:01:05.430> was<00:01:06.000> very<00:01:06.240> wasteful<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.560> I

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
which pretty much was very wasteful so I

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.980 
which pretty much was very wasteful so I
started<00:01:08.220> going<00:01:08.490> little<00:01:08.970> by<00:01:09.090> little<00:01:09.330> adding<00:01:09.840> it

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
started going little by little adding it

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.380 
started going little by little adding it
to<00:01:10.170> section<00:01:10.560> by<00:01:10.680> section<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.460> then<00:01:12.240> when<00:01:12.360> I

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
to section by section and then when I

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.210 
to section by section and then when I
felt<00:01:12.750> like<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:13.049> was<00:01:13.200> thoroughly<00:01:13.409> saturated

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
felt like it was thoroughly saturated

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.230 
felt like it was thoroughly saturated
and<00:01:14.520> coated

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
and coated

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.109 
and coated
I<00:01:15.270> would<00:01:15.990> then<00:01:16.170> begin<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.680> detangle<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.549> this

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
I would then begin to detangle and this

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.770 
I would then begin to detangle and this
product<00:01:18.390> has<00:01:18.570> so<00:01:19.140> much<00:01:19.920> slip<00:01:20.790> all<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.600> the

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.310 
time
I<00:01:24.810> have<00:01:25.080> not<00:01:25.229> sped<00:01:25.530> up<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.770> video<00:01:25.890> at<00:01:26.369> all<00:01:26.400> and

I have not sped up the video at all and

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.140 
I have not sped up the video at all and

I mean this product is literally one of

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.300 
I mean this product is literally one of
those<00:01:30.420> products<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.619> kind<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:31.950> feel<00:01:32.009> are

those products that you kind of feel are

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.490 
those products that you kind of feel are
a<00:01:32.340> hidden<00:01:32.579> gem<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.509> know<00:01:33.630> when<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:33.810> saw<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.200> in

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
a hidden gem you know when I saw it in

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.910 
a hidden gem you know when I saw it in
the<00:01:34.619> store<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.310> definitely<00:01:36.210> questioned<00:01:37.020> the

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
the store I definitely questioned the

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.330 
the store I definitely questioned the
integrity<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.790> because<00:01:39.119> there's<00:01:39.450> lots<00:01:39.659> of

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
integrity of it because there's lots of

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.510 
integrity of it because there's lots of
taboo<00:01:41.340> topics<00:01:42.210> around<00:01:42.890> motions<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.310> whether

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
taboo topics around motions and whether

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.219 
taboo topics around motions and whether
or<00:01:44.700> not<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:45.360> know<00:01:45.479> they're<00:01:45.750> good<00:01:45.990> for<00:01:46.110> our

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
or not you know they're good for our

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.700 
or not you know they're good for our
hair<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.189> on<00:01:47.430> but<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.540> was<00:01:49.020> very<00:01:49.259> happy<00:01:49.680> that

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
hair and so on but I was very happy that

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.469 
hair and so on but I was very happy that
I<00:01:49.920> gave<00:01:50.189> this<00:01:50.430> product<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.909> chance<00:01:51.210> because

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
I gave this product a chance because

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.289 
I gave this product a chance because
I've<00:01:52.409> had<00:01:52.680> nothing<00:01:52.860> but<00:01:53.159> great<00:01:53.310> success<00:01:53.820> with

it and it's very affordable which is one

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.300 
it and it's very affordable which is one
of<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.750> reasons<00:01:58.110> why<00:01:58.259> I<00:01:58.619> don't<00:01:59.159> mind

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310
