I<00:00:17.000> got<00:00:18.000> this<00:00:18.180> idea<00:00:18.390> from<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.869> chef<00:00:19.080> friend<00:00:19.320> of

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
I got this idea from a chef friend of

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.920 
I got this idea from a chef friend of
mine<00:00:19.590> who<00:00:19.859> uses<00:00:20.580> vitamin<00:00:21.090> C<00:00:21.330> when<00:00:21.480> he's<00:00:21.630> making

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
mine who uses vitamin C when he's making

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.950 
mine who uses vitamin C when he's making
pesto<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:23.189> keep<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.640> basil<00:00:24.150> nice<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.750> bright

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
pesto to keep the basil nice and bright

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.259 
pesto to keep the basil nice and bright
green<00:00:25.019> even<00:00:25.650> if<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:25.920> sits<00:00:26.130> for<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.430> day<00:00:26.670> or<00:00:26.820> so

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
green even if it sits for a day or so

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.540 
green even if it sits for a day or so
because<00:00:27.840> you<00:00:28.439> see<00:00:28.619> vitamin<00:00:29.099> C<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:29.429> an

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
because you see vitamin C is an

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.759 
because you see vitamin C is an
antioxidant<00:00:29.929> in<00:00:30.929> other<00:00:31.080> words<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.410> prevents

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
antioxidant in other words it prevents

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.950 
antioxidant in other words it prevents
things<00:00:31.949> from<00:00:32.160> browning<00:00:32.510> which<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.660> what<00:00:33.840> you

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
things from browning which is what you

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.810 
things from browning which is what you
usually<00:00:34.140> get<00:00:34.559> if<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:34.950> try<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.219> grill<00:00:35.520> green

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
usually get if you try to grill green

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.030 
usually get if you try to grill green
beans<00:00:36.059> or<00:00:36.270> roast<00:00:36.510> green<00:00:36.750> beans<00:00:37.020> without<00:00:37.590> them

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
beans or roast green beans without them

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.680 
beans or roast green beans without them
so<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.670> idea<00:00:38.940> here<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.210> let's<00:00:39.390> keep<00:00:39.540> them

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
so the idea here is let's keep them

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.900 
so the idea here is let's keep them
bright<00:00:39.960> green<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:40.500> they<00:00:40.590> look<00:00:40.770> fabulous<00:00:41.010> and

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
bright green so they look fabulous and

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.000 
bright green so they look fabulous and
they<00:00:42.000> taste<00:00:42.210> great<00:00:42.300> too<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:42.890> speaking<00:00:43.890> of

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
they taste great too so speaking of

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.950 
they taste great too so speaking of
taste<00:00:44.250> I've<00:00:44.489> made<00:00:44.760> an<00:00:44.879> oil<00:00:45.149> this<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.539> lemon

them with really great flavor the key to
this<00:01:41.939> I<00:01:42.150> find<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.780> have<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.020> preheat

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
this I find is that you have to preheat

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.950 
this I find is that you have to preheat
it<00:01:43.649> for<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.890> good<00:01:44.040> 10<00:01:44.369> minutes<00:01:44.399> before<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.750> cook

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
it for a good 10 minutes before you cook

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.460 
it for a good 10 minutes before you cook
on<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.170> if<00:01:47.130> it's<00:01:47.939> not<00:01:48.060> preheated<00:01:48.390> then<00:01:48.990> things

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
on it if it's not preheated then things

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.050 
on it if it's not preheated then things
just<00:01:49.560> sort<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.829> roast<00:01:50.130> on<00:01:50.310> top<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.850> grill

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
just sort of roast on top of the grill

things cook quickly remember the longer

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.300 
things cook quickly remember the longer
that<00:01:57.180> they<00:01:57.329> cook<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:58.590> more<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.920> tendency

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
that they cook the more of a tendency

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
the beans out of the bowl here make sure

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.730 
the beans out of the bowl here make sure
that<00:02:06.119> they're<00:02:06.329> not<00:02:06.540> just<00:02:06.930> really<00:02:07.200> wet<00:02:07.560> with

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
that they're not just really wet with

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.130 
that they're not just really wet with
oil<00:02:08.039> because<00:02:08.520> if<00:02:08.789> they<00:02:09.030> were<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.539> create<00:02:09.929> some

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
oil because if they were you create some

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.830 
oil because if they were you create some
flare-ups<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.970> you<00:02:11.970> want<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.239> get<00:02:12.330> as<00:02:12.480> much<00:02:12.660> of

growing pan as possible you're gonna

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.470 
growing pan as possible you're gonna
lose<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.650> few<00:02:19.980> of<00:02:20.159> these<00:02:20.280> it's<00:02:20.580> just<00:02:20.849> inevitable

the<00:03:18.359> lemon<00:03:18.540> on<00:03:18.750> earlier<00:03:19.230> because<00:03:19.590> this<00:03:19.829> also

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
the lemon on earlier because this also

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.750 
the lemon on earlier because this also
has<00:03:20.459> a<00:03:20.630> tendency<00:03:21.630> to<00:03:21.750> make<00:03:21.870> things<00:03:22.139> brown<00:03:22.760> and

has a tendency to make things brown and

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.069 
has a tendency to make things brown and

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:30.430 
then you can season them to taste but
I'm<00:03:25.230> thinking<00:03:25.530> these<00:03:25.650> are<00:03:25.950> just<00:03:26.190> about<00:03:26.340> ready
