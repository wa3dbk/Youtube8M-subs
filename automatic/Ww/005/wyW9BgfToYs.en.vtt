 what I did with his mascot 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.200
 I'm doing here it mattered 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.150
 I choose them 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.150
 which is called the test c 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.990
 imported 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.539

 if I come on the track too much and vegetables 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.089
 So I am 

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:19.529
 at the end 

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:22.529

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:50.639
 so if I can only decommend the tenth is dismal 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:53.109
 by simulating 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:55.089

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:26.409
 heyer these people die here a simulated 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.259
