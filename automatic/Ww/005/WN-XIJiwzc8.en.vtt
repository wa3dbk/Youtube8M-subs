00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.350 
one is a little bit different just

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.440 
one is a little bit different just
because<00:00:25.100> it<00:00:25.340> has<00:00:25.460> the<00:00:25.610> word<00:00:25.640> performance<00:00:26.120> in

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:26.450 
because it has the word performance in

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.400 
because it has the word performance in
it<00:00:26.570> no<00:00:26.750> I'm<00:00:26.870> just<00:00:26.960> kidding

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
it no I'm just kidding

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.380 
it no I'm just kidding
I<00:00:27.440> don't<00:00:27.800> know<00:00:27.890> it's<00:00:28.850> a<00:00:28.910> little<00:00:29.090> bit<00:00:29.180> different

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
I don't know it's a little bit different

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.350 
I don't know it's a little bit different
if<00:00:29.780> you<00:00:29.990> guys<00:00:30.140> have<00:00:30.320> seen<00:00:30.560> this<00:00:31.160> specific<00:00:32.029> line

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
if you guys have seen this specific line

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.150 
if you guys have seen this specific line
from<00:00:32.689> optimal<00:00:33.170> nutrition<00:00:33.230> it's<00:00:33.770> a<00:00:33.829> little<00:00:34.039> bit

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
from optimal nutrition it's a little bit

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.350 
from optimal nutrition it's a little bit
more<00:00:34.340> expensive<00:00:35.239> as<00:00:35.750> far<00:00:36.050> as<00:00:36.940> just<00:00:37.940> a<00:00:38.060> regular

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
more expensive as far as just a regular

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.780 
more expensive as far as just a regular

little<00:00:42.560> bit<00:00:42.680> different<00:00:43.390> it<00:00:44.410> this<00:00:45.410> one<00:00:45.620> is

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
little bit different it this one is

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.549 
little bit different it this one is
vanilla<00:00:45.890> shake<00:00:46.399> and<00:00:46.840> this<00:00:47.840> vanilla<00:00:48.200> shake

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
vanilla shake and this vanilla shake

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.310 
vanilla shake and this vanilla shake
actually<00:00:49.100> does<00:00:49.340> taste<00:00:49.670> like<00:00:49.850> vanilla

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
actually does taste like vanilla

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.770 
actually does taste like vanilla
compared<00:00:51.320> to<00:00:51.620> the<00:00:52.220> gold<00:00:52.850> standard<00:00:52.970> vanilla

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
compared to the gold standard vanilla

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.860 
compared to the gold standard vanilla
which<00:00:54.020> is<00:00:54.290> not<00:00:54.530> very<00:00:54.770> good<00:00:54.980> at<00:00:55.100> all<00:00:55.360> about<00:00:56.360> a<00:00:56.510> 6

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
which is not very good at all about a 6

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.110 
which is not very good at all about a 6
out<00:00:57.020> of<00:00:57.050> 10<00:00:57.290> on<00:00:57.530> the<00:00:57.649> regular<00:00:58.160> vanilla<00:00:58.370> on<00:00:58.850> this

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
out of 10 on the regular vanilla on this

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.479 
out of 10 on the regular vanilla on this
one<00:00:59.300> it<00:00:59.420> was<00:00:59.510> about<00:00:59.780> a<00:00:59.809> 99.5<00:01:00.620> out<00:01:00.920> of<00:01:00.980> 10<00:01:01.129> very

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
one it was about a 99.5 out of 10 very

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.780 
one it was about a 99.5 out of 10 very
good<00:01:01.760> taste<00:01:02.030> I<00:01:02.980> was<00:01:03.980> able<00:01:04.100> to<00:01:04.219> mix<00:01:04.399> it<00:01:04.549> with<00:01:04.640> all

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
good taste I was able to mix it with all

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.399 
good taste I was able to mix it with all
kinds<00:01:05.119> of<00:01:05.180> different<00:01:05.540> recipes<00:01:05.689> and<00:01:06.140> fruits

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
kinds of different recipes and fruits

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.289 
kinds of different recipes and fruits
and<00:01:06.649> shakes<00:01:06.890> and<00:01:07.189> everything<00:01:07.520> like<00:01:07.609> that<00:01:07.850> it

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
and shakes and everything like that it

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.020 
and shakes and everything like that it
worked<00:01:08.479> out<00:01:08.630> perfectly<00:01:09.109> so<00:01:09.579> the<00:01:10.579> nutrition

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
worked out perfectly so the nutrition

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.609 
worked out perfectly so the nutrition
facts<00:01:11.240> are<00:01:11.389> a<00:01:11.420> little<00:01:11.569> bit<00:01:11.780> different<00:01:12.259> on<00:01:12.380> the

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
facts are a little bit different on the

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.940 
facts are a little bit different on the
performance<00:01:13.810> 140<00:01:14.810> calories<00:01:15.079> per<00:01:15.530> serving<00:01:15.709> so

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
performance 140 calories per serving so

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.279 
performance 140 calories per serving so
it's<00:01:16.249> a<00:01:16.280> little<00:01:16.399> bit<00:01:16.549> higher<00:01:16.840> some<00:01:17.840> of<00:01:17.899> the<00:01:18.020> the

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
it's a little bit higher some of the the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:21.099 
it's a little bit higher some of the the
gold<00:01:18.499> standard<00:01:18.799> ones<00:01:19.009> are<00:01:19.130> about<00:01:19.279> 120<00:01:20.060> 130<00:01:20.299> so

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:21.109 
gold standard ones are about 120 130 so

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:24.669 
gold standard ones are about 120 130 so
not<00:01:21.770> much<00:01:21.979> but<00:01:22.219> a<00:01:22.279> little<00:01:22.490> bit<00:01:22.700> different<00:01:23.649> one

00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:24.679 
not much but a little bit different one

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:27.279 
not much but a little bit different one
rounded<00:01:25.340> scoop<00:01:25.670> also<00:01:26.240> has<00:01:26.420> 30<00:01:26.779> grams<00:01:27.109> of

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:27.289 
rounded scoop also has 30 grams of

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:30.249 
rounded scoop also has 30 grams of
protein<00:01:27.520> whereas<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:28.939> gold<00:01:29.420> standard<00:01:29.929> is

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
protein whereas the gold standard is

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.639 
protein whereas the gold standard is
about<00:01:30.590> 24<00:01:31.429> to<00:01:31.789> 27<00:01:32.389> I<00:01:32.689> believe<00:01:32.990> so<00:01:33.229> a<00:01:33.259> few<00:01:33.529> more

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
about 24 to 27 I believe so a few more

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:35.709 
about 24 to 27 I believe so a few more
grams<00:01:33.889> of<00:01:34.069> protein<00:01:34.429> in<00:01:34.549> there<00:01:34.700> 3<00:01:35.299> grams<00:01:35.539> of

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:35.719 
grams of protein in there 3 grams of

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:37.480 
grams of protein in there 3 grams of
carbs<00:01:36.139> 1<00:01:36.349> gram<00:01:36.529> of<00:01:36.560> fat<00:01:36.709> those<00:01:37.219> are<00:01:37.340> pretty

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
carbs 1 gram of fat those are pretty

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.539 
carbs 1 gram of fat those are pretty
much<00:01:37.579> the<00:01:37.700> same<00:01:37.849> as<00:01:38.359> the<00:01:38.569> gold<00:01:39.109> standard<00:01:39.549> so

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
much the same as the gold standard so

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:41.589 
much the same as the gold standard so
it's<00:01:40.969> a<00:01:41.029> little<00:01:41.209> bit<00:01:41.299> different

00:01:41.589 --> 00:01:41.599 
it's a little bit different

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:42.999 
it's a little bit different
