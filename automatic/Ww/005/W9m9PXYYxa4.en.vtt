00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.350
 hello everyone welcome to my channel in 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.840
 this time I'm going to show you how to make a 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:11.110
 shrimp ceviche the way we 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:14.110
 we do it and here I pound and a half of 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.480
 medium shrimp that we then wash 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.150
 we peel it and unveil it and cut it 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.660
 so the smallest thing I say because it's 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.759
 my sister and her friend then the most 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.580
 as little as I can and for the game here 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:32.380
 we have 15 lemons the juice of 15 lemons 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:33.880
 and we have two garlics and one way but 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.580
 is in a chopped as finely as 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.320
 can and we also have a little 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.890
 a half tablespoon of consommÃ© 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:45.310
 Dissolved shrimp was already boiled too 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.350
 a little bit here we have it and for 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.930
 then put it on the sides because 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.990
 they're going to be toast we have 3 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.270
 with cucumbers 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.210
 cut well we removed the seeds and 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.710
 my sister made us say croissants 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.320
 and also half an onion 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.890
 lodging and croissants and 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:10.030
 4 tomatoes pardoned in half moons and 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:12.160
 half of a bunch of cilantro is going to 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.270
 make for toast good so let's 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:20.590
 to start we're going to put on until 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:24.140
 dry and if it seems that we passed but 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:27.810
 is good is better than about missing 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:31.320
 we are going to put a little more 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.790
 I am sometimes to taste and now leave 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.090
 grit after it has been cooked 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.090
 shrimp 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.340
 everyone 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.980
 we are not going to let it rest that is stitched 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.570
 about 20 minutes to half an hour and right now 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.250
 let's go and let's show them what is it 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.740
 that continues like sweets the scared 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.740
 I hope you like it is something easier but 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.720
 doctor 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.659
 Well, that's how we're more or less 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.610
 we leave an hour that already depends on 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.170
 when he puts missiles finish 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.689
 putting the whole game remember that 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.509
 mentions them and so where nothing else 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.860
 I threw him and gave him a little bit and they're 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.530
 cooked 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.620
 we are going to add the ingredients 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:17.030
 that I mentioned the cucumbers the 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.030
 safety of tomato and cilantro 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:24.160
 it's a way for us to do the 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.160
 Ceviche 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:37.180
 and we're going to put everything else 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:39.159
 onion and tomato and cilantro 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.030
 I also have the vacancy to put 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:44.030
 above 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.030
 to 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.520
 We will not return it 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:58.440
 we will return well and also as 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.440
 let's make the toast 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.680
 that has a lot of cucumber but that's how 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.209
 my sister eats it with a lot of opinion 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.209
 you to compose I like 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.659
 and finally so I stay 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.250
 the ingredients are some see how 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.260
 they are staying 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.910
 there is no margin after we make a 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.290
 little bit of black pepper 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.350
 I already have my toast 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:29.800
 just talk here 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:33.100
 and if you want or can put more sauce 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:39.420
 up but as you already have the way 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:42.420
 I do not think we're going to put the avocado 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.420
 Y 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:49.090
 I'm lacking beer 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.660
 good can be expected has liked until 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.660

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.569
