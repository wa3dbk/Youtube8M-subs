00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.790
 hello today we bring you to the boxing of the i'm 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.810
 all mini pc 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:19.320
 a compact model 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:22.690
 presents in the box as you can see 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.450
 with the drawing of the model 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.610
 and all the information in Chinese ones 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.570
 qr codes where we can access 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.570
 information 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.779
 let's open it 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.500
 around here we'll see 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.579
 but another small box 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.190
 we can find the rest of 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.190
 components 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.980
 yes no 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.030
 I do not have a manual 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.840
 in Chinese 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:24.970
 an HDMI cable to connect it to our 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.970
 monitor or TV screen 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.969
 and a feeder 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.530
 how much is it 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:42.300
 pretty compact American plug that 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.300
 we have some adapter 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:51.040
 and we see that it's 5 volts 2500 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:53.590
 amps is not enough but 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.530
 a little hidden but sure that 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.550
 It works well 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.750
 a pretty small peg 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.750
 around the feeding 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:10.500
 let's see on my pc 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.950
 I have fitted a rubber sleeve for 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.950
 to protect 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.230
 and we see the design expresses quite 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:27.150
 because inside it has a 7000 battery 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.130
 milligrams 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.430
 and then it does not end until 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.490
 in the weight 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.410
 with a metal grate 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.760
 with a drawing here that looks like a 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.760
 grid but they are drawings 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.019
 it does not work for ventilation 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.019
 it's pretty well topped 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.830
 and it is a good dissipation surface 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.740
 but now we see that this type of fish 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.740
 they need 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.250
 a web of equipment since they are passive 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:05.180
 You can connect quite 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.180
 on the front 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:11.640
 We have a status LED 2 usb 2.0 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.330
 and a power button 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.660
 in the back we have 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:30.000
 with this energy an audio jack a 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:32.720
 mini hdmi port 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.720
 we will remove 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:39.420
 because if not with a standard HDMI cable 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:46.210
 a micro usb otg and a card reader 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.210
 minisd 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.920
 and even in mini pcs or have those 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:57.470
 connections in the beginning this model 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:04:01.890
 He was out with the Intel z 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:04.080
 37 35 of which had a usb port 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.750
 3.0 but that model is totally 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:12.090
 exhausted and now they only go out with the 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:16.850
 intel processor ez 37 35 axis that only 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:22.049
 has usb 2.0 inside it has 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:24.240
 ram memory ddr3 l low power consumption and 32 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:27.810
 gigabytes of internal storage that is 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:32.190
 enough is going to have the windows and the 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:34.620
 office and some lighter program 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.380
 if we want we can expand it by 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.010
 of the microsd slot for example and have 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.010
 another unit 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:49.160
 32 or 64 gb extra apart from that 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.840
 definitely 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.850
 one 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.290
 then we can not connect all the 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.810
 peripheral signs of all 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:05:02.639
 units that we want when also with 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:06.390
 wifi b / g / n bluetooth 4.0 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:10.630
 with being also remotely 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:12.750
 the peripherals with the field 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.270
 well we'll see the full analysis 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.370
 it looks good 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.870
 I think it will behave technically well 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.550
 according to the comments in some 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.190
 users who have received it before 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.430
 us a model that has cost in 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:30.460
 get why 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.460
 it was hard to find the stop broke 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:37.550
 Well it took a while to arrive but 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:40.510
 sure that as far as power is 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:42.930
 similar to others 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.529
 the important point is 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.989
 the thermal 

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:50.739
 we see each other in detail in the analysis 

00:05:46.989 --> 00:05:50.739
 when the point pc is 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:53.509
 see you later
