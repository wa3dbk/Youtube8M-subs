00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.019

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.250
 also in this he has a nice sum of mi 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.130
 maybe even like 300 400 type yesterday is 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.250

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.780

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.480
 in the next few days I would load you 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.360
 Review kiss to note that many 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.350
 so many of you have asked me for the 43rd 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.230
 we begin to comment on the 43rd matches 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.450
 golasso a golasso lords of di 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.940
 this mitch man kiss the gentlemen 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.879
 look at that golasso practically a 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.739
 wonderful inverted lob 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:01.859
 really a good apocalyptic one 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.840
 also comes the 2 to 0 always from bashar 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.900
 a great goal is a great goal 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.840
 beautiful normal action in short bichsel ago 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.630
 a nice assist to kiss for that 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.299
 he then signs the 2 to 0 in the 90th 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.450
 but the answer comes a little late 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:22.189
 I have to say about miroslav klose al 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.049
 ninetieth era already it was already all done 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:27.299
 wins the first three points another three 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.040
 points not really the first and I go to 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.689
 playing the second school is the second 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.400
 sorry I'm a little dyslexic 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.890
 today as always, however, it goes well 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.270
 meeting this liga bbva which is not 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.240
 just a liga bbva is a kind of 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.030
 short Spanish hybrid 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.159
 the Spanish hybrid with a midfield 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.290
 I have to say a lot, but too much 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.439
 offensive with, inter alia, jordi alba 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:55.100
 put as td comes to the eleventh 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:56.570
 this beautiful goal by miraglia a nice volley 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.700
 I must say that I liked miraglia is 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.950
 really a very strong great player 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.399
 very bad or advice 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.049
 I recommend it, however, the goal of 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:09.229
 amber watts and I have to say enough 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:11.989
 lucky here at the 69th a shot of 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:16.220
 benzema that courtois say takes badly 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:20.110
 can't lock it and it will go will go 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.980
 beats gentlemen unfortunately obviously 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.640
 obviously the ninetieth 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.970
 here is the benzema goal of course 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:35.360
 navas on the strip almost March sold 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:37.760
 rosique at its own level 200,000 you know 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.799
 that I really hate mammamia ninetieth 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.840
 pre-headed goal I hate these 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:44.209
 so things ends so 2 to 1 between 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.340
 the other I did many many already though 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.870
 more laps so let's say maybe 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.380
 defeat does not deserve me not me 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:55.070
 I deserved a lot I'm going to do some 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:58.280
 market and perhaps the joy of many 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:00.200
 I'm going to buy the good the brain 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.760
 chelsea version so many of you had but 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.760
 written but take the version that is 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.500
 others that take it stronger is fine 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.290
 I take it but to sell the tea 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.790
 brain version for work is for 2,600 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.069
 credits obviously being a trans 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.170
 france therefore not being a version 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.880
 before the transfer if therefore no longer 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.549
 available in the packages costs a little 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:23.209
 the more I take it coc director 11 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:26.180
 99 contracts of form and chelsea 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.680
 obviously I'm going to put it and this is it 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.260
 the team with which he goes to face the 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.630
 third game benteke lukaku kiss was 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.549
 tired so I put him on the bench 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.750
 I think it's one of the very few times in 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:38.270
 which puts him on the bench and what not 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.740
 takes physical forms for him because 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.920
 because I can't help it 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:45.530
 meeting this hybrid because unibet 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.500
 chase is a hybrid we do the German 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.340
 with the mixed German bundesliga with ozil 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.390
 and cc that certainly is not mine 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.210
 personally will not admit but not to 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:59.300
 never put single players cc like del 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:01.900
 common coc because they are save 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.830
 thick and half players in my opinion 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.030
 if with me 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:11.300
 sorry for the repetition in the meantime 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:14.180
 twelfth goal of benteke to the thirtieth 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.910
 the 2 to 0 also comes to mind 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.980
 that a benteke ars really fit 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.650
 very fit 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:23.480
 a nice blow that without a kiss to the fa 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.820
 good figure I have to say but why 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.800
 but this is so strong that it is not 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.850
 he can make it look bad even six 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.830
 messi o ronaldo 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.320
 arrives the 2 1 to the thirty-fourth of 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.600
 gotze the only one shot i believe one of 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.390
 very few I believe 12 shots of mine 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.270
 opponent in this game comes though 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:45.110
 the very right I believe 3 to 1 always of 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.650
 benteke at the 72nd this great shot of 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.540
 right 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.500
 among other things, many said again 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:54.260
 version 81 and more cassano really 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.660
 practically identical to the 79 version 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.900
 so I don't know what to change sincerely 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:03.860
 comes the 4 1 of the brain for itself or 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:07.129
 chelsea that here begins with this 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.770
 a nice opponent goal here and 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:13.369
 nothing I go to buy I'm going to get 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:17.899
 another three points and then 15 points I 

00:05:13.369 --> 00:05:20.959
 12 are missing for the 5 mi division 

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:23.300
 it seems and since so many of you had me 

00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:26.959
 asked let me see the statistics of 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.439
 kiss the enemies kiss the beholds 22 

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:31.099
 games 

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:32.539
 38 goals but monstrous beast boys I will you 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:34.849
 greeting the video is over 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:38.959
 put a nice lightman if we can 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:42.199
 we manage to understand why to implement a 

00:05:38.959 --> 00:05:43.519
 to get to other 300 I like in 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:47.379
 in the next few days I will recharge my 

00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:47.379
 kiss review is beautiful
