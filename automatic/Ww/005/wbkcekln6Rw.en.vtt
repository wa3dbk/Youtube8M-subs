00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:09.210
 hello how are you friend of youtube I have 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.190
 how to change it from your pc this with the 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.889
 purpose that when you are connected 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.900
 the internet helps you in what is the 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.500
 internet speed in something because to 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.689
 sometimes there are ip conflicts and that we have 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.609
 an error down here on the coast of the clock 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.490
 that is an error that there is a conflict 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.749
 ip and that takes you at the time of 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:34.759
 Internet connection to do so will 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:34.759
 we go to the start the control panel 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.900
 from here we go tells me connections from 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:43.059
 network 2 click here here you are in 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.410
 our connection or descend from local 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:48.340
 we give you right click 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.920
 properties 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:55.210
 and here we take internet protocol from 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.580
 cpp we give in properties and as you see 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.700
 here there is no is not configured we are going 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:03.750
 to give use the following ip address 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:10.950
 let's write 92 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:14.360
 1 681 and here we can not even ask for 1 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:18.210
 from forgiveness from 2 to 250 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.710
 group of 45 we click on the second and 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.140
 it will automatically be configured 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.680
 according to another server and here we give 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.390
 same 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:31.250
 we said almost seemed like the one above 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:31.250
 19 21 681 involves 1 and then 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.560
 we can have in this case my 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.690
 servers are this we can 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.370
 set it up so here we give this 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.070
 for example legally the server that 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.980
 is 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.980
 percent 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.980
 48 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.430
 and we give you here to accept 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.430
 close 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.900
 very well and we close everything and it will be 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.640
 configured tripe this way no longer 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.950
 we are going to have ip conflicts in the 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.510
 case that error came out again 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.130
 in the procedure as I have 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.000
 done and the only thing that has to change 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.440
 is the value of the ip I put 40 and 45 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.420
 you can change to another value 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.520
 let it be 30 40 the number that you 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.580
 want and in this way correct that 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.950
 conflict problem in this way they go 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.500
 to be able to change in an easy way 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.540
 good this serious this video tutorial is 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.580
 simple fast so that when they have 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.300
 problems is subscribe to my channel 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.160

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.550
