in more than just the extra custom

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.360 
in more than just the extra custom
classes<00:00:51.660> although<00:00:52.350> custom<00:00:52.800> class<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.190> still

classes although custom class is still

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.450 
classes although custom class is still
on<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.579> list<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:54.320> that's<00:00:55.320> interesting<00:00:55.980> what

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
on that list so that's interesting what

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.459 
on that list so that's interesting what
we<00:00:56.550> don't<00:00:56.699> know<00:00:56.820> yet<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.270> how<00:00:57.719> many<00:00:57.780> tokens<00:00:58.230> you

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
we don't know yet is how many tokens you

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.380 
we don't know yet is how many tokens you
get<00:00:58.680> for<00:00:58.859> prestige<00:00:59.160> or<00:00:59.550> how<00:01:00.000> many<00:01:00.059> tokens

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
get for prestige or how many tokens

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.599 
get for prestige or how many tokens
these<00:01:00.719> things<00:01:00.960> cost<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.530> has<00:01:02.129> been<00:01:02.340> confirmed

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
these things cost it has been confirmed

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.880 
these things cost it has been confirmed
that<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.059> max<00:01:03.300> level<00:01:03.629> will<00:01:03.989> be<00:01:04.019> 80<00:01:04.409> but<00:01:04.769> they

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
that the max level will be 80 but they

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.530 
that the max level will be 80 but they
have<00:01:05.040> not<00:01:05.159> confirmed<00:01:05.519> how<00:01:05.790> many<00:01:05.970> prestigious

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
have not confirmed how many prestigious

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.380 
have not confirmed how many prestigious
there<00:01:06.750> will<00:01:06.900> be<00:01:07.130> seeing<00:01:08.130> as<00:01:08.369> cod4<00:01:08.700> had<00:01:09.150> 10

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
there will be seeing as cod4 had 10

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.950 
there will be seeing as cod4 had 10
prestigious<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.200> mw2<00:01:11.010> had<00:01:11.340> 10<00:01:11.580> pastiches<00:01:12.030> you

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
prestigious and mw2 had 10 pastiches you

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.750 
prestigious and mw2 had 10 pastiches you
can<00:01:13.200> probably<00:01:13.710> assume<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.460> there<00:01:14.610> will<00:01:14.729> be

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
can probably assume that there will be

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.670 
can probably assume that there will be
somewhere<00:01:15.150> around<00:01:15.180> 10<00:01:15.540> prestigious<00:01:16.110> that's

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
somewhere around 10 prestigious that's

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.840 
somewhere around 10 prestigious that's
just<00:01:16.890> what<00:01:16.979> I'm<00:01:17.070> thinking<00:01:17.369> they<00:01:17.460> might<00:01:17.610> change

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
just what I'm thinking they might change

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.149 
just what I'm thinking they might change
it<00:01:18.030> up<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.240> bit<00:01:18.270> but<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.869> think<00:01:19.619> 10<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.950> pretty

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
it up a bit but I think 10 is a pretty

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.370 
it up a bit but I think 10 is a pretty
decent<00:01:20.520> number<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:20.970> since<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.720> max<00:01:21.930> level<00:01:22.140> is

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
decent number and since the max level is

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.440 
decent number and since the max level is
80<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:23.040> can<00:01:23.220> probably<00:01:23.460> assume<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.360> will

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
80 you can probably assume that it will

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.510 
80 you can probably assume that it will
be<00:01:24.570> maybe<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.229> little<00:01:25.470> bit<00:01:25.680> easier<00:01:26.009> than<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.400> is

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
be maybe a little bit easier than it is

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.719 
be maybe a little bit easier than it is
to<00:01:26.729> level<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.210> MW<00:01:27.479> two<00:01:28.159> since<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.280> max<00:01:29.579> level

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
to level in MW two since the max level

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.910 
to level in MW two since the max level
in<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.000> game<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.360> 70<00:01:30.840> they're<00:01:31.619> gonna<00:01:31.710> have<00:01:31.860> an

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
in this game is 70 they're gonna have an

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.380 
in this game is 70 they're gonna have an
extra<00:01:32.130> 10<00:01:32.340> levels<00:01:32.700> it's<00:01:32.939> probably<00:01:33.210> going<00:01:33.329> to

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
extra 10 levels it's probably going to

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.600 
extra 10 levels it's probably going to
be<00:01:33.479> around<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.320> similar<00:01:34.770> amount<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:35.130> procedures

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
be around a similar amount of procedures

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.780 
be around a similar amount of procedures
I'm<00:01:35.820> assuming<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.979> so<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.040> can<00:01:38.220> assume<00:01:38.460> that

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
I'm assuming and so you can assume that

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.910 
I'm assuming and so you can assume that
it<00:01:39.270> will<00:01:39.509> be<00:01:39.540> just<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.140> little<00:01:40.170> bit<00:01:40.439> easier<00:01:40.860> to

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
it will be just a little bit easier to

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.499 
it will be just a little bit easier to
level<00:01:41.220> but<00:01:41.939> there<00:01:42.119> are<00:01:42.240> some<00:01:42.360> really

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
level but there are some really

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.069 
level but there are some really
interesting<00:01:42.780> things<00:01:43.049> in<00:01:43.560> cheese<00:01:44.189> shop<00:01:45.079> they

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
interesting things in cheese shop they

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.469 
interesting things in cheese shop they
have<00:01:46.320> reset<00:01:46.799> all<00:01:46.979> stats<00:01:47.490> which<00:01:48.030> I'm<00:01:48.329> assuming

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
have reset all stats which I'm assuming

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.170 
have reset all stats which I'm assuming

we reset your leaderboard stats so like

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
if you get a really bad Katy in the

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.499 
if you get a really bad Katy in the
beginning<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.790> game<00:01:53.939> when<00:01:54.210> you're<00:01:54.329> first

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
beginning of the game when you're first

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.569 
beginning of the game when you're first
learning<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.470> can<00:01:55.649> then<00:01:55.680> reset<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.430> and

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
learning it you can then reset it and

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:57.950 
learning it you can then reset it and
have<00:01:56.850> like<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.090> really<00:01:57.210> high<00:01:57.450> Katie<00:01:57.719> or<00:01:57.930> a

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
have like a really high Katie or a

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.420 
have like a really high Katie or a
really<00:01:58.200> high<00:01:58.350> win-loss<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:59.100> look<00:01:59.280> like

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
really high win-loss you look like

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.630 
really high win-loss you look like
you're<00:01:59.610> super<00:01:59.909> pro<00:02:00.119> or<00:02:00.329> something<00:02:00.630> like<00:02:00.719> that

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
you're super pro or something like that

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.800 
you're super pro or something like that
some<00:02:02.640> people<00:02:02.909> are<00:02:02.969> going<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.210> hate<00:02:03.360> on<00:02:03.420> but<00:02:03.780> I

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
some people are going to hate on but I

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.010 
some people are going to hate on but I
think<00:02:04.049> it's<00:02:04.170> kind<00:02:04.320> of<00:02:04.439> cool<00:02:05.750> you<00:02:06.750> know<00:02:06.869> then

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
think it's kind of cool you know then

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.600 
think it's kind of cool you know then
maybe<00:02:07.049> people<00:02:07.530> won't<00:02:07.680> camp<00:02:08.099> really<00:02:08.369> hard<00:02:08.550> in

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
maybe people won't camp really hard in

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.279 
maybe people won't camp really hard in
the<00:02:08.670> beginning<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.060> game<00:02:09.209> when<00:02:10.110> they're

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
the beginning of the game when they're

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.050 
the beginning of the game when they're
just<00:02:10.410> learning<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.830> because<00:02:11.250> they<00:02:11.400> can<00:02:11.580> reset

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
just learning it because they can reset

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.630 
just learning it because they can reset
their<00:02:12.390> stats<00:02:12.629> later<00:02:12.900> on

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
their stats later on

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.559 
their stats later on
but<00:02:14.640> I<00:02:14.670> definitely<00:02:14.819> think<00:02:15.090> this<00:02:15.239> will<00:02:15.360> cause<00:02:15.540> a

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
but I definitely think this will cause a

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.360 
but I definitely think this will cause a
lot<00:02:15.750> more<00:02:15.900> people<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.410> prestige<00:02:16.800> with<00:02:17.129> all<00:02:17.250> the

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
lot more people to prestige with all the

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.610 
lot more people to prestige with all the
different<00:02:17.640> options<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:18.120> can<00:02:18.300> get<00:02:18.540> they<00:02:19.500> also

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
different options you can get they also

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.680 
different options you can get they also
have<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:19.950> double<00:02:20.250> XP<00:02:20.670> which<00:02:20.940> I'm<00:02:21.180> not<00:02:21.330> sure<00:02:21.540> if

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
have the double XP which I'm not sure if

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.300 
have the double XP which I'm not sure if
that's<00:02:21.989> for<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.319> entire<00:02:22.590> next<00:02:22.920> receipt

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
that's for the entire next receipt

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.130 
that's for the entire next receipt
because<00:02:23.610> that<00:02:23.910> sounds<00:02:24.209> like<00:02:24.390> pretty

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
because that sounds like pretty

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.220 
because that sounds like pretty
overpowered<00:02:26.010> for<00:02:26.849> a<00:02:27.980> prestige<00:02:28.980> unlock<00:02:29.489> thing

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
overpowered for a prestige unlock thing

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.539 
overpowered for a prestige unlock thing
because<00:02:31.230> you<00:02:31.769> know<00:02:31.860> then<00:02:32.040> you<00:02:32.099> could<00:02:32.220> just<00:02:32.310> do

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
because you know then you could just do

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.210 
because you know then you could just do
double<00:02:32.849> XP<00:02:33.150> every<00:02:33.330> prestige<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:33.959> get<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.739> max

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
double XP every prestige and get to max

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.530 
double XP every prestige and get to max

prestige<00:02:45.720> which<00:02:46.470> I<00:02:46.829> believe<00:02:47.610> would<00:02:48.390> mean<00:02:48.599> like

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
prestige which I believe would mean like

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.170 
prestige which I believe would mean like
a<00:02:48.900> weapon<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:50.069> attachments<00:02:50.760> or<00:02:50.849> something

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
a weapon and attachments or something

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.059 
a weapon and attachments or something
like<00:02:51.269> that<00:02:51.329> or<00:02:51.540> maybe<00:02:51.989> you<00:02:52.049> have<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.290> re<00:02:52.739> unlock

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
like that or maybe you have to re unlock

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.610 
like that or maybe you have to re unlock
the<00:02:53.280> attachments<00:02:53.849> but<00:02:54.110> like<00:02:55.110> you<00:02:55.230> can<00:02:55.349> carry

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
the attachments but like you can carry

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.860 
the attachments but like you can carry
over<00:02:55.769> a<00:02:55.890> weapon<00:02:56.250> so<00:02:56.519> if<00:02:56.730> your<00:02:57.150> favorite<00:02:57.540> gun<00:02:57.750> is
