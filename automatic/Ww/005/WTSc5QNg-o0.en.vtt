00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.689
 Hello everyone, this is another episode of 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.000
 My name is daniel. 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.099
 Wulff and his family of beers 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.650
 Today I'll talk a little about the 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:28.980
 Argentinian craft beers 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:34.140
 I brought here three beers the first 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:38.040
 Antares Antares is a brewery 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.320
 which is in buenos aires even and she has 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.500
 She came to Brazil but they stopped. 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.980
 and it has a network of 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.850
 bars franchises there including a 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.850

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.059
 is this the website the pens have a bar and 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.910
 I went there in April of last year in 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.350
 some regions of the city and I think 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.870
 even though some other 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:06.390
 cities besides buenos aires they have the 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:08.369
 breweries here these two beers are 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.030

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.100

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.200

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.600

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.049

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.450

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.270
 Good martin who invited me to be a judge. 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.990

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.049

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.100
 international 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.689
 besides these beers, Argentina is already 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.630
 dawning on this issue of beers 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.369
 have many micro breweries 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:00.450
 one that I can mention that I already 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.430
 I tasted the other world she beer 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.280
 another world since it was highlighted that 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.420
 I had the perception was very good is a 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.709
 night baum half of them antares 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.290
 unfortunately only played on a piano stout 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.420
 but below their team is very good 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.989

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.989
 plant s 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.780
 The dark coloring here is to keep the 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:32.450
 state already has good foaming 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:34.060
 with a totally closed beige color give 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.080
 a hops 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.350
 Funny, we expect a lot more. 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.270
 aroma of roasted malt 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.000
 but here is evidence of a hops 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.510
 in the background mode of the animals 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.510
 wrong 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:57.670

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:59.350

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.160
 I'm with her to save time and she 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:06.120
 it's perfect but subtle very light 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:10.180
 acidity but does not disturb the demonstration 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.890
 good body straight taste continues aroma of 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:18.450
 very persistent roasted malt 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:18.450
 excellent beer brest bariloche 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:34.570
 this one a beer do not think he 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:36.400
 with raspberry alcohol content 7.5 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.200
 usually these beers that carry 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.140
 Fruits are lighter but this one 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.470
 There is a lot of body to body a high content 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.470
 alcoholic 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:56.380
 bright pink filtered coloration 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:59.550
 slightly opaque time the formation of 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.550
 nose foam 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:14.420
 light and very red fruit aroma 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:16.799
 put a beer in your mouth that has a body 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.320
 subtle ideas does not compare to a 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.180
 for example an almost 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.710
 beer that has added fruit not 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.500
 it will be compared that they are much more acidic 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.510
 she is mounted and has a slight 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:32.400
 Acidity and has this taste of fruit 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:34.290
 red but not good automatic 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.290
 beer too 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:44.960
 Now let's go to the door there soon. 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:44.960
 dying value means 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.020
 It's not like in the Mafia with the Mafia. 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:59.850
 dark color totally closed good 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.850
 foaming nose 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.610
 Look for a beer. 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.110
 I think this one are training 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:11.280
 a pot of beer is not micro 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:13.110
 brewery and she's already with me 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.620
 almost a year ago 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:19.770
 Her scent is perfect for a 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:22.430
 roasted or toasted with light and subtle 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.430
 a profit 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.100
 powerful bitterness reminiscent of a wolf 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.970
 door 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:39.410
 the powerful American profile slight bitterness 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:42.470
 astringency the end of the tinho 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:45.310
 roasting here a few beers 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.840
 argentinian handicrafts 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.330
 While other brands weather 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.620
 patagonia has another one that until 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.910
 including several medals 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.960

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.510
 good 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.150
 the argentine school the beers 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:04.730
 Argentina is breeding on this issue 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:08.000
 of the Argentine school and doing good 

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:11.450

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.890
 What Argentine beer do you know of? 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:15.580
