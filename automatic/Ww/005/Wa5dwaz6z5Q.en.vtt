demo<00:00:37.410> dozer<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.610> tool<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.120> use<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.780> I

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
demo dozer is the tool that I use and I

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.020 
demo dozer is the tool that I use and I
think<00:00:40.079> you'll<00:00:40.290> appreciate<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.430> value<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.790> it

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
think you'll appreciate the value of it

00:00:42.030 --> 00:01:20.130 
think you'll appreciate the value of it
when<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.300> can<00:00:42.690> see<00:00:42.930> how<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.110> use<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.620> there

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140

as<00:01:21.140> you<00:01:21.350> can<00:01:21.500> see<00:01:21.650> the<00:01:21.860> demo<00:01:22.040> dozer<00:01:22.370> is<00:01:22.700> really

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
as you can see the demo dozer is really

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.150 
as you can see the demo dozer is really
the<00:01:23.630> best<00:01:23.840> bucket<00:01:24.320> there<00:01:24.500> is<00:01:24.650> the<00:01:24.860> spreading

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.160 
the best bucket there is the spreading

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.970 
the best bucket there is the spreading
chips<00:01:25.610> not<00:01:26.450> only<00:01:26.720> can<00:01:26.930> you<00:01:27.080> dose<00:01:27.350> with<00:01:27.680> it<00:01:27.830> and

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
chips not only can you dose with it and

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.610 
chips not only can you dose with it and
push<00:01:28.160> stuff<00:01:28.430> around<00:01:28.840> but<00:01:29.840> you<00:01:30.020> can<00:01:30.170> pick<00:01:30.380> up

push stuff around but you can pick up

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.360 
push stuff around but you can pick up
piles<00:01:31.460> and<00:01:31.960> very<00:01:32.960> carefully<00:01:33.440> distribute<00:01:34.220> it

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
piles and very carefully distribute it

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.480 
piles and very carefully distribute it
throughout<00:01:34.670> the<00:01:34.970> job<00:01:35.210> site<00:01:35.510> but<00:01:36.470> also<00:01:36.650> the

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
throughout the job site but also the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.330 
throughout the job site but also the
fact<00:01:37.730> that<00:01:37.820> it<00:01:37.970> holds<00:01:38.240> so<00:01:38.750> much<00:01:39.020> of<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:39.920> of<00:01:40.160> the
