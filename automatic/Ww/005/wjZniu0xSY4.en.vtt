00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.550 
variations I could turn that into five
or<00:02:29.190> six<00:02:29.430> variations<00:02:29.760> really<00:02:30.210> fast<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:31.200> can<00:02:31.290> go

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
or six variations really fast you can go

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.590

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
which is what the Russian did back in

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.090 
which is what the Russian did back in
the<00:02:46.050> day<00:02:46.170> for<00:02:46.230> where<00:02:46.620> Louie<00:02:46.800> got<00:02:47.010> the

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
the day for where Louie got the

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.800 
the day for where Louie got the
conjugate<00:02:47.490> method<00:02:47.730> from<00:02:47.940> it<00:02:48.420> was<00:02:48.510> always<00:02:48.690> a

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
conjugate method from it was always a

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.990 
conjugate method from it was always a
little<00:02:49.020> different<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.620> so<00:02:49.680> in<00:02:50.430> each<00:02:50.610> time<00:02:50.850> you

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
little different and so in each time you

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.280 
little different and so in each time you
come<00:02:51.150> back<00:02:51.300> around<00:02:51.600> you<00:02:51.780> trying<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:51.990> beat<00:02:52.140> your

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.940 
old max so you're just plain to get
yourself<00:02:54.390> constantly<00:02:54.720> alright<00:02:55.710> so<00:02:55.830> there's

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
yourself constantly alright so there's

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.170 
yourself constantly alright so there's
tons<00:02:56.070> of<00:02:56.190> little<00:02:56.310> variations<00:02:56.790> you<00:02:56.850> can<00:02:56.910> make

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180
