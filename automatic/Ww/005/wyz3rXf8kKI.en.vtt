today<00:00:06.180> is<00:00:06.240> Tuesday<00:00:06.930> so<00:00:07.319> I<00:00:07.350> have<00:00:07.560> another<00:00:07.799> tank

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
today is Tuesday so I have another tank

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.940 
today is Tuesday so I have another tank
tip<00:00:08.340> for<00:00:08.610> you<00:00:08.700> today<00:00:09.019> we're<00:00:10.019> changing<00:00:10.530> out<00:00:10.679> our

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
tip for you today we're changing out our

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.910 
tip for you today we're changing out our
filter<00:00:11.700> cartridges<00:00:12.360> on<00:00:12.660> our<00:00:13.320> three<00:00:13.620> stage

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
filter cartridges on our three stage

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.820 
filter cartridges on our three stage
carbon<00:00:14.460> filter<00:00:14.880> as<00:00:15.030> you<00:00:15.839> can<00:00:15.990> see<00:00:16.230> here<00:00:16.560> the

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
carbon filter as you can see here the

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.880 
carbon filter as you can see here the
cold<00:00:17.100> water<00:00:17.369> line<00:00:17.609> is<00:00:17.880> shut<00:00:18.060> off<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.680> we<00:00:19.680> have

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
cold water line is shut off and we have

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.750 
cold water line is shut off and we have
all<00:00:20.189> three<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.520> our<00:00:20.640> cartridges<00:00:21.180> removed<00:00:21.930> and

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
all three of our cartridges removed and

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.910 
all three of our cartridges removed and
what<00:00:23.760> we're<00:00:23.939> doing<00:00:24.269> here<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.869> replacing<00:00:25.769> them

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
what we're doing here is replacing them

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.890 
what we're doing here is replacing them
so<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.220> wanted<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.640> share<00:00:26.970> with<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.210> the

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
so I wanted to share with you the

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.950 
so I wanted to share with you the
cartridges<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:29.039> picked<00:00:29.429> up<00:00:29.640> as

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
cartridges that I picked up as

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.650 
cartridges that I picked up as
replacements<00:00:30.980> in<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.279> three-stage<00:00:33.149> carbon

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
replacements in this three-stage carbon

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.950 
replacements in this three-stage carbon
filter<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:35.100> specifically<00:00:36.059> is<00:00:36.300> good<00:00:36.630> for

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
filter and this specifically is good for

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.250 
filter and this specifically is good for
removing<00:00:37.309> chloramines<00:00:38.309> from<00:00:39.270> your<00:00:39.510> water<00:00:39.809> so

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
removing chloramines from your water so

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.139 
removing chloramines from your water so
these<00:00:40.530> are<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.860> three<00:00:41.129> stages<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.879> filtration

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
these are the three stages of filtration

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.979 
these are the three stages of filtration
that<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:42.780> use<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.950> remove<00:00:44.250> chloramines<00:00:44.879> from<00:00:45.840> my

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
that I use to remove chloramines from my

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.950 
that I use to remove chloramines from my
water<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:47.010> first<00:00:47.250> stage<00:00:47.550> here<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:48.030> just<00:00:48.809> your

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
water the first stage here is just your

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.189 
water the first stage here is just your
typical<00:00:49.110> sediment<00:00:49.860> filter<00:00:50.219> this<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.449> rated<00:00:51.719> at

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
typical sediment filter this is rated at

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.490 
typical sediment filter this is rated at
one<00:00:52.500> micron<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.789> remove<00:00:54.059> sand<00:00:54.360> silt<00:00:54.780> dirt<00:00:55.140> rust

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
one micron to remove sand silt dirt rust

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.549 
one micron to remove sand silt dirt rust
particles<00:00:55.770> from<00:00:56.190> your<00:00:56.430> water<00:00:56.989> this<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.050> what

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
particles from your water this is what

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.369 
particles from your water this is what
my<00:00:58.800> old<00:00:59.010> one<00:00:59.250> looks<00:00:59.789> like<00:01:00.030> after<00:01:00.780> three<00:01:01.079> months

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
my old one looks like after three months

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.920 
my old one looks like after three months
of<00:01:01.530> use<00:01:01.739> which<00:01:02.550> isn't<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:03.090> bad<00:01:03.510> it's

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
of use which isn't that bad it's

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.710 
of use which isn't that bad it's
actually<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.650> pretty<00:01:04.920> good<00:01:05.040> shape<00:01:05.479> if<00:01:06.479> your

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
actually in pretty good shape if your

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.600 
actually in pretty good shape if your
water<00:01:06.960> has<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.260> lot<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.560> rust<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.189> or<00:01:08.400> if<00:01:08.490> your

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
water has a lot of rust in it or if your

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.609 
water has a lot of rust in it or if your
pipes<00:01:08.909> have<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.240> lot<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.570> rust<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.110> this

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
pipes have a lot of rust in it this

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.760 
pipes have a lot of rust in it this
would<00:01:10.860> be<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.040> lot<00:01:11.340> more<00:01:11.960> rust<00:01:12.960> colored<00:01:13.380> than<00:01:13.560> it

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
would be a lot more rust colored than it

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.969 
would be a lot more rust colored than it
is<00:01:13.890> here<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.659> this<00:01:15.659> isn't<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.170> bad<00:01:16.439> but<00:01:16.890> I'm

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
is here so this isn't that bad but I'm

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.160 
is here so this isn't that bad but I'm
going<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.189> replace<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.700> anyways<00:01:18.060> because<00:01:18.600> the

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
going to replace it anyways because the

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.249 
going to replace it anyways because the
longer<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.560> let<00:01:20.100> this<00:01:20.280> go<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:21.570> more<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:21.990> gets

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
longer you let this go the more it gets

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.940 
longer you let this go the more it gets
trapped<00:01:22.680> up<00:01:22.979> with<00:01:23.310> sediment<00:01:24.180> particles<00:01:24.659> and

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
trapped up with sediment particles and

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.370 
trapped up with sediment particles and
your<00:01:25.950> flow<00:01:26.250> rate<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.759> reduced<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.630> this<00:01:28.140> one's

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
your flow rate is reduced so this one's

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.800 
your flow rate is reduced so this one's
getting<00:01:28.530> retired<00:01:29.100> this<00:01:29.880> brand<00:01:30.240> new<00:01:30.360> white<00:01:30.600> one

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
getting retired this brand new white one

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.490 
getting retired this brand new white one
is<00:01:30.930> going<00:01:31.140> in<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.680> that's<00:01:32.369> my<00:01:32.610> first<00:01:32.939> stage

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
is going in and that's my first stage

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.160 
is going in and that's my first stage
for<00:01:34.500> my<00:01:34.650> filter<00:01:35.040> my<00:01:35.670> second<00:01:36.060> stage<00:01:36.270> I'm<00:01:36.810> using

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
for my filter my second stage I'm using

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.990 
for my filter my second stage I'm using
the<00:01:37.710> pentek<00:01:38.280> klore<00:01:38.820> plus<00:01:39.180> 10<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:40.340> this<00:01:41.340> filter

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
the pentek klore plus 10 and this filter

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.050 
the pentek klore plus 10 and this filter
is<00:01:42.270> specifically<00:01:43.259> designed<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:44.399> remove

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
is specifically designed to remove

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.870 
is specifically designed to remove
chloramines<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:46.369> that's<00:01:47.369> what's<00:01:47.579> in<00:01:47.729> my

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
chloramines and that's what's in my

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.530 
chloramines and that's what's in my
water<00:01:48.380> it<00:01:49.380> has<00:01:49.530> one<00:01:49.829> micron<00:01:50.310> rating<00:01:50.549> so<00:01:51.270> same

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
water it has one micron rating so same

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.770 
water it has one micron rating so same
as<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:52.020> sediment<00:01:52.920> filter<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:54.270> important

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
as the sediment filter and the important

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.550 
as the sediment filter and the important
part<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.560> this<00:01:55.950> filter<00:01:56.460> uses<00:01:57.360> a

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
part is that this filter uses a

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.889 
part is that this filter uses a
catalytic<00:01:58.560> carbon<00:01:58.979> block<00:01:59.579> the<00:02:00.420> whole<00:02:00.630> thing

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
catalytic carbon block the whole thing

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.440 
catalytic carbon block the whole thing
is<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.079> carbon<00:02:01.560> block<00:02:02.060> and<00:02:03.060> that's<00:02:03.270> the

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
is a carbon block and that's the

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.999 
is a carbon block and that's the
important<00:02:03.930> part<00:02:04.110> because<00:02:04.500> it's<00:02:04.680> going<00:02:04.860> to

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
important part because it's going to

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.399 
important part because it's going to
force<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.490> water<00:02:05.700> through<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.329> carbon<00:02:06.930> the

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
force the water through the carbon the

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.440 
force the water through the carbon the
activated<00:02:08.280> carbon

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
activated carbon

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.840 
activated carbon
and<00:02:09.930> and<00:02:10.860> that's<00:02:11.100> what's<00:02:11.310> going<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.490> slow<00:02:11.670> the

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
and and that's what's going to slow the

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.400 
and and that's what's going to slow the
water<00:02:12.000> down<00:02:12.180> that's<00:02:12.810> what's<00:02:13.020> going<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.200> have

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
water down that's what's going to have

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.360 
water down that's what's going to have
you<00:02:14.190> know<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.490> most<00:02:14.640> contact<00:02:15.180> time<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:16.370> and

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
you know the most contact time and and

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.390 
you know the most contact time and and
this<00:02:18.000> carbon<00:02:18.390> is<00:02:18.840> specifically<00:02:19.590> designed<00:02:19.890> to

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
this carbon is specifically designed to

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.750 
this carbon is specifically designed to
remove<00:02:20.610> chloramines<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:22.410> third<00:02:22.890> stage<00:02:23.220> here

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
remove chloramines the third stage here

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.490 
remove chloramines the third stage here
I'm<00:02:24.030> using<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.960> pentek<00:02:25.470> CB<00:02:26.010> c10<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.170> this<00:02:28.170> is

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
I'm using the pentek CB c10 and this is

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.810 
I'm using the pentek CB c10 and this is
another<00:02:28.830> carbon<00:02:29.220> block<00:02:29.960> solid<00:02:30.960> carbon<00:02:31.350> and

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
another carbon block solid carbon and

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.480 
another carbon block solid carbon and
this<00:02:32.820> one<00:02:33.060> is<00:02:33.890> specifically<00:02:34.890> designed<00:02:35.130> for

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
this one is specifically designed for

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.940 
this one is specifically designed for
chlorine<00:02:36.080> but<00:02:37.080> it<00:02:37.230> also<00:02:37.410> works<00:02:37.770> for

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
chlorine but it also works for

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.810 
chlorine but it also works for
chloramine<00:02:38.550> and<00:02:38.990> this<00:02:39.990> has<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.010> point<00:02:41.610> five

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
chloramine and this has a point five

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.010 
chloramine and this has a point five
micron<00:02:42.390> size

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
micron size

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.400 
micron size
so<00:02:43.650> as<00:02:44.100> we<00:02:44.490> progressively<00:02:45.090> go<00:02:45.480> we're<00:02:46.320> getting

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
so as we progressively go we're getting

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.250 
so as we progressively go we're getting
to<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.709> smaller<00:02:47.070> and<00:02:47.190> smaller<00:02:47.520> size<00:02:47.880> so

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
to a smaller and smaller size so

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.870 
to a smaller and smaller size so
hopefully<00:02:49.260> by<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.470> time<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.340> water<00:02:50.550> gets

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
hopefully by the time the the water gets

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.690 
hopefully by the time the the water gets
to<00:02:51.060> this<00:02:51.209> stage<00:02:51.530> all<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.590> heavier<00:02:53.310> particles

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
to this stage all the heavier particles

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.120 
to this stage all the heavier particles
will<00:02:54.330> be<00:02:54.360> out<00:02:54.570> of<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.810> water<00:02:55.020> and<00:02:55.290> this<00:02:55.950> will

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
will be out of the water and this will

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.580 
will be out of the water and this will
be<00:02:56.250> our<00:02:56.370> last<00:02:56.580> stage<00:02:56.910> before<00:02:57.540> that<00:02:58.350> water

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
be our last stage before that water

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.320 
be our last stage before that water
enters<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.959> aquariums<00:03:01.910> so<00:03:02.910> those<00:03:03.120> are

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
enters the the aquariums so those are

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.050 
enters the the aquariums so those are
the<00:03:03.390> three<00:03:03.630> stages<00:03:03.870> I<00:03:04.459> got<00:03:05.459> all<00:03:05.640> of<00:03:05.760> these<00:03:05.850> on

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
the three stages I got all of these on

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.790 
the three stages I got all of these on

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
go buy yourself some of these filters

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.780 
go buy yourself some of these filters
they<00:03:12.450> work<00:03:12.690> great<00:03:12.930> I've<00:03:13.350> used<00:03:13.860> them<00:03:14.160> for<00:03:14.190> three

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
they work great I've used them for three

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.320 
they work great I've used them for three
months<00:03:15.209> and<00:03:15.390> now<00:03:16.049> I'm<00:03:16.260> switching<00:03:16.560> them<00:03:16.890> out

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
months and now I'm switching them out

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.759 
months and now I'm switching them out
you<00:03:18.330> know<00:03:18.420> every<00:03:18.660> three<00:03:19.019> months<00:03:19.260> in<00:03:19.620> my

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
you know every three months in my

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:20.390 
you know every three months in my
fishroom

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
fishroom

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.150 
fishroom
at<00:03:20.670> a<00:03:20.730> drip<00:03:21.209> rate<00:03:21.480> of<00:03:21.810> about<00:03:22.260> forty<00:03:22.769> gallons

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
at a drip rate of about forty gallons

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.210 
at a drip rate of about forty gallons
per<00:03:23.430> day<00:03:24.019> that's<00:03:25.019> what<00:03:25.230> I'm<00:03:25.350> looking<00:03:25.739> at<00:03:25.920> for<00:03:26.190> a

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
per day that's what I'm looking at for a

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.690 
per day that's what I'm looking at for a
replacement<00:03:26.580> time<00:03:27.180> on<00:03:27.510> these<00:03:27.900> filters<00:03:28.470> I

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
replacement time on these filters I

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.479 
replacement time on these filters I
believe<00:03:29.700> this<00:03:30.209> one<00:03:30.510> goes<00:03:31.140> for<00:03:31.799> around<00:03:32.070> two

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
believe this one goes for around two

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.460 
believe this one goes for around two
thousand<00:03:32.940> five<00:03:33.120> hundred<00:03:33.330> gallons<00:03:33.660> that's

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
thousand five hundred gallons that's

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.020 
thousand five hundred gallons that's
what<00:03:34.680> it's<00:03:34.799> rated<00:03:35.190> for<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:35.640> that<00:03:35.730> would<00:03:35.880> only

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
what it's rated for and that would only

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.690 
what it's rated for and that would only
last<00:03:36.360> me<00:03:36.660> about<00:03:36.780> two<00:03:37.620> months<00:03:38.010> not<00:03:38.670> three

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
last me about two months not three

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.009 
last me about two months not three
months<00:03:39.920> but<00:03:40.920> those<00:03:41.370> ratings<00:03:41.910> are<00:03:42.180> for<00:03:42.660> you

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
months but those ratings are for you

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.840

filter cartridges might last a year or

filter cartridges might last a year or
more<00:04:00.390> most<00:04:00.930> people<00:04:01.110> will<00:04:01.620> go<00:04:01.799> six<00:04:02.220> months

without<00:04:03.239> changing<00:04:03.900> their<00:04:04.049> cartridges<00:04:04.440> I've

without changing their cartridges I've

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.490 
without changing their cartridges I've
decided<00:04:06.209> to<00:04:06.420> go<00:04:06.660> a<00:04:06.690> little<00:04:06.900> bit<00:04:07.110> on<00:04:07.140> the<00:04:07.290> safe

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
decided to go a little bit on the safe

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.670 
decided to go a little bit on the safe
side<00:04:07.560> and<00:04:08.040> I'm<00:04:09.000> sticking<00:04:09.480> with<00:04:09.690> a<00:04:09.720> three<00:04:10.440> month

replacement<00:04:11.370> cycle<00:04:11.780> anyways<00:04:12.780> this<00:04:13.140> was<00:04:13.200> one

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
replacement cycle anyways this was one

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.630 
replacement cycle anyways this was one
of<00:04:13.560> my<00:04:13.739> old<00:04:13.950> carbon<00:04:14.640> block<00:04:14.910> filters<00:04:15.420> and<00:04:15.660> I

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
of my old carbon block filters and I

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.820 
of my old carbon block filters and I
wanted<00:04:17.640> to<00:04:17.820> see<00:04:18.510> what<00:04:18.660> was<00:04:18.780> inside<00:04:18.989> to<00:04:19.560> check

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
wanted to see what was inside to check

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.720 
wanted to see what was inside to check
out<00:04:20.010> exactly<00:04:20.549> what<00:04:20.910> a<00:04:20.940> carbon

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
out exactly what a carbon

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.110 
out exactly what a carbon
looks<00:04:21.970> like<00:04:22.210> and<00:04:22.450> so<00:04:23.260> I<00:04:23.320> cut<00:04:23.710> it<00:04:23.830> in<00:04:23.920> half<00:04:24.130> so

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
looks like and so I cut it in half so

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.030 
looks like and so I cut it in half so
this<00:04:25.270> was<00:04:25.450> a<00:04:25.480> used<00:04:25.840> cartridge<00:04:26.440> I've<00:04:26.680> been

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
this was a used cartridge I've been

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.670 
this was a used cartridge I've been
using<00:04:27.220> it<00:04:27.460> for<00:04:27.610> three<00:04:27.820> months<00:04:27.940> and<00:04:28.300> I<00:04:29.200> cut<00:04:29.530> that

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
using it for three months and I cut that

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.710 
using it for three months and I cut that
open<00:04:30.130> and<00:04:30.370> you<00:04:30.460> can<00:04:30.610> see<00:04:30.910> when<00:04:31.330> they<00:04:31.480> say

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
open and you can see when they say

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.620 
open and you can see when they say
carbon<00:04:32.110> block<00:04:32.500> they<00:04:33.310> really<00:04:33.850> do<00:04:34.030> mean<00:04:34.360> a

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
carbon block they really do mean a

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.350 
carbon block they really do mean a
carbon<00:04:35.080> block<00:04:35.230> this<00:04:35.710> is<00:04:35.770> solid<00:04:36.370> carbon<00:04:36.790> you

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
carbon block this is solid carbon you

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.850 
carbon block this is solid carbon you
can<00:04:37.510> see<00:04:37.630> there's<00:04:37.840> a<00:04:37.900> little<00:04:38.020> flake<00:04:38.410> there<00:04:38.710> on

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
can see there's a little flake there on

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.480 
can see there's a little flake there on
the<00:04:38.980> side<00:04:39.220> that<00:04:39.940> came<00:04:40.180> off<00:04:40.390> of<00:04:40.420> the<00:04:40.630> edge<00:04:40.840> and

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
the side that came off of the edge and

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.420 
the side that came off of the edge and
and<00:04:42.490> this<00:04:43.030> is<00:04:43.300> pretty<00:04:44.080> much<00:04:44.200> solid<00:04:44.920> I<00:04:45.250> mean<00:04:45.400> I

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
and this is pretty much solid I mean I

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.030 
and this is pretty much solid I mean I
can't<00:04:45.820> I<00:04:46.060> can't<00:04:46.630> take<00:04:46.810> it<00:04:46.990> apart<00:04:47.290> if<00:04:47.590> this<00:04:47.890> was

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
can't I can't take it apart if this was

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.460 
can't I can't take it apart if this was
granules<00:04:48.730> it<00:04:48.940> would<00:04:49.060> fall<00:04:49.330> apart<00:04:49.360> so<00:04:49.960> this

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
granules it would fall apart so this

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.420 
granules it would fall apart so this
really<00:04:50.800> is<00:04:51.130> a<00:04:51.490> carbon<00:04:52.000> block<00:04:52.120> it's<00:04:52.570> pressed

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
really is a carbon block it's pressed

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.360 
really is a carbon block it's pressed
into<00:04:54.430> this<00:04:54.700> shape<00:04:55.060> and<00:04:55.300> then<00:04:55.570> it's<00:04:55.750> put<00:04:56.020> into

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
into this shape and then it's put into

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.240 
into this shape and then it's put into
into<00:04:57.370> this<00:04:57.610> you<00:04:58.450> know<00:04:58.570> this<00:04:59.080> cartridge<00:04:59.530> so

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
into this you know this cartridge so

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.670 
into this you know this cartridge so
that's<00:05:00.670> what<00:05:00.910> it<00:05:01.000> looks<00:05:01.210> like<00:05:01.450> the<00:05:01.900> water<00:05:02.170> is

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
that's what it looks like the water is

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.150 
that's what it looks like the water is
forced<00:05:03.160> through<00:05:03.460> those<00:05:04.300> very<00:05:04.690> fine

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
forced through those very fine

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.300 
forced through those very fine
you<00:05:06.610> know<00:05:06.730> particles<00:05:07.620> within<00:05:08.620> that<00:05:08.950> that

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
you know particles within that that

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.730 
you know particles within that that
pressed<00:05:09.730> carbon<00:05:10.180> block<00:05:10.540> in<00:05:10.840> order<00:05:11.320> to<00:05:11.560> get

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
pressed carbon block in order to get

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.140 
pressed carbon block in order to get
through<00:05:11.980> in<00:05:12.340> order<00:05:12.460> to<00:05:12.610> get<00:05:12.760> into<00:05:12.970> the

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
through in order to get into the

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.600 
through in order to get into the
aquarium<00:05:13.630> so<00:05:13.870> you're<00:05:14.770> looking<00:05:14.890> at<00:05:15.190> a<00:05:15.250> very

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
aquarium so you're looking at a very

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.030 
aquarium so you're looking at a very
long<00:05:15.880> contact<00:05:16.510> time<00:05:16.720> with<00:05:16.960> very<00:05:17.680> small

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
long contact time with very small

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.550 
long contact time with very small
particles<00:05:18.550> of<00:05:18.670> water<00:05:18.940> to<00:05:19.840> get<00:05:19.990> through<00:05:20.260> that

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
particles of water to get through that

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.320 
particles of water to get through that
but<00:05:21.010> that's<00:05:21.190> what<00:05:21.370> it<00:05:21.490> looks<00:05:21.520> like<00:05:21.850> I<00:05:22.090> thought

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
but that's what it looks like I thought

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.600 
but that's what it looks like I thought
that<00:05:22.540> was<00:05:22.720> neat<00:05:22.960> these<00:05:23.800> are<00:05:23.950> the<00:05:24.040> filters<00:05:24.250> I'm

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
that was neat these are the filters I'm

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.310 
that was neat these are the filters I'm
using<00:05:24.820> I'm<00:05:25.240> going<00:05:25.420> to<00:05:25.480> go<00:05:25.570> install<00:05:25.900> them<00:05:26.110> right

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
using I'm going to go install them right

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.860 
using I'm going to go install them right
now<00:05:26.500> and<00:05:26.710> then<00:05:27.700> I'll<00:05:27.820> turn<00:05:27.970> my<00:05:28.180> water<00:05:28.360> back<00:05:28.660> on

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
now and then I'll turn my water back on

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.620 
now and then I'll turn my water back on
