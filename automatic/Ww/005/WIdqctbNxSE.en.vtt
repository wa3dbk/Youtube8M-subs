living organism so nutrition as I
mentioned<00:00:31.800> before<00:00:31.920> also<00:00:32.550> said<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.239> do<00:00:33.420> any

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
mentioned before also said to do any

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.440 
mentioned before also said to do any
kind<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.200> work<00:00:34.469> we<00:00:34.890> meet<00:00:35.130> energy<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.940> where

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
kind of work we meet energy and where

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.630 
kind of work we meet energy and where
does<00:00:36.660> this<00:00:36.840> energy<00:00:37.079> come<00:00:37.260> from<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:38.190> energy

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
does this energy come from the energy

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.090 
does this energy come from the energy
comes<00:00:38.910> from<00:00:39.239> food<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:40.020> basically<00:00:40.559> comes<00:00:40.890> from

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
comes from food it basically comes from

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.430 
comes from food it basically comes from
the<00:00:41.579> nutrients<00:00:42.180> which<00:00:42.480> are<00:00:42.629> present<00:00:43.020> inside

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
the nutrients which are present inside

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.810

also you need a lot of energy and that

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.319 
also you need a lot of energy and that
is<00:01:35.250> why<00:01:35.369> these<00:01:35.430> days<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.970> would<00:01:36.060> have<00:01:36.150> seen

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.920 
do we need a lot of energy and this is
not<00:01:56.009> only<00:01:56.040> true<00:01:56.460> for<00:01:56.549> human<00:01:57.030> beings<00:01:57.329> but<00:01:57.750> this

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
not only true for human beings but this

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.830 
not only true for human beings but this
is<00:01:58.079> true<00:01:58.350> for<00:01:58.380> all<00:01:58.770> life-forms<00:01:59.520> so<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.360> gave<00:02:00.659> you

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
is true for all life-forms so I gave you

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.420 
is true for all life-forms so I gave you
the<00:02:00.899> example<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.409> human<00:02:01.560> beings<00:02:01.979> because<00:02:02.280> you

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
the example of human beings because you

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.780 
the example of human beings because you
can<00:02:02.610> relate<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.270> better<00:02:03.829> right<00:02:04.829> so<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.369> is<00:02:05.460> true

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
can relate it better right so it is true

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.780 
can relate it better right so it is true
for<00:02:06.030> plants<00:02:06.659> as<00:02:06.810> well<00:02:06.869> as<00:02:07.229> other

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
for plants as well as other

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.260 
for plants as well as other
forms<00:02:08.360> as<00:02:08.540> well<00:02:09.910> correct

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
forms as well correct

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.810 
forms as well correct
so<00:02:11.870> in<00:02:12.110> nutrition<00:02:12.890> what<00:02:13.340> are<00:02:13.460> we<00:02:13.550> going<00:02:13.670> to

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
so in nutrition what are we going to

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.880 
so in nutrition what are we going to
talk<00:02:13.970> about<00:02:14.180> we<00:02:14.870> are<00:02:14.900> going<00:02:15.230> to<00:02:15.380> talk<00:02:15.650> about

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
talk about we are going to talk about

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.850 
talk about we are going to talk about
the<00:02:16.820> way<00:02:17.060> food<00:02:17.480> is<00:02:17.540> obtained<00:02:18.110> by<00:02:18.320> an<00:02:18.470> organism

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
the way food is obtained by an organism

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.030 
the way food is obtained by an organism
how<00:02:19.280> each<00:02:19.670> organism<00:02:20.320> receives<00:02:21.320> it<00:02:21.530> food<00:02:21.800> its

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
how each organism receives it food its

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.130 
how each organism receives it food its
food<00:02:22.310> from<00:02:22.580> from<00:02:23.030> where<00:02:23.240> does<00:02:23.390> it<00:02:23.450> get<00:02:23.750> it<00:02:23.930> food

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
food from from where does it get it food

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.200 
food from from where does it get it food
and<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:25.010> second<00:02:25.370> thing<00:02:25.550> which<00:02:25.730> we<00:02:25.910> will<00:02:26.060> talk

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
and the second thing which we will talk

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.050 
and the second thing which we will talk
about<00:02:26.390> is<00:02:26.780> how<00:02:27.320> the<00:02:27.380> complex<00:02:27.980> food<00:02:28.400> which<00:02:28.940> is

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
about is how the complex food which is

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.480 
about is how the complex food which is
taken<00:02:29.390> by<00:02:29.420> an<00:02:29.690> organism<00:02:30.320> is<00:02:30.470> converted<00:02:31.100> into<00:02:31.310> a

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
taken by an organism is converted into a

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.270 
taken by an organism is converted into a
simple<00:02:32.210> form<00:02:32.540> which<00:02:32.990> can<00:02:33.230> be<00:02:33.440> absorbed<00:02:33.860> by<00:02:34.220> the

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
simple form which can be absorbed by the

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.120 
simple form which can be absorbed by the
cells<00:02:34.970> because<00:02:35.630> the<00:02:35.780> need<00:02:35.990> of<00:02:36.020> food<00:02:36.800> or<00:02:37.100> the

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
cells because the need of food or the

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.910 
cells because the need of food or the
need<00:02:37.430> of<00:02:37.640> energy<00:02:37.850> is<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.930> demand<00:02:39.560> of<00:02:39.770> the

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
need of energy is the demand of the

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.890 
need of energy is the demand of the
cells<00:02:40.220> inside<00:02:40.550> our<00:02:40.880> body<00:02:41.209> the<00:02:41.480> body<00:02:41.690> is

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
cells inside our body the body is

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.110 
cells inside our body the body is
ultimately<00:02:42.650> made<00:02:42.920> up<00:02:43.010> of<00:02:43.160> cells<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:43.880> each

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
ultimately made up of cells and each

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.930 
ultimately made up of cells and each
cell<00:02:44.530> generates<00:02:45.530> energy<00:02:45.890> so<00:02:46.280> they<00:02:46.400> need<00:02:46.640> some

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
cell generates energy so they need some

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.030 
cell generates energy so they need some
energy<00:02:47.360> to<00:02:47.390> perform<00:02:47.630> the<00:02:48.080> various<00:02:48.380> metabolic

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
energy to perform the various metabolic

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.970 
energy to perform the various metabolic
activities<00:02:49.670> so<00:02:50.300> depending<00:02:50.810> so<00:02:51.050> but<00:02:51.230> at<00:02:51.830> the

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
activities so depending so but at the

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.250 
activities so depending so but at the
same<00:02:52.130> time<00:02:52.370> the<00:02:52.640> cells<00:02:52.880> cannot<00:02:53.360> digest

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
same time the cells cannot digest

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.740 
same time the cells cannot digest
complex<00:02:55.070> foods<00:02:55.370> they<00:02:55.580> cannot<00:02:55.850> utilize

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
complex foods they cannot utilize

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.590 
complex foods they cannot utilize
complex<00:02:57.650> foods<00:02:57.950> for<00:02:58.280> their<00:02:58.520> energy<00:02:58.700> needs<00:02:59.120> so

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
complex foods for their energy needs so

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.199 
complex foods for their energy needs so
they<00:02:59.720> need<00:02:59.989> energy<00:03:00.290> in<00:03:00.739> simpler<00:03:01.520> forms<00:03:01.850> so<00:03:02.030> how

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
they need energy in simpler forms so how

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.690 
they need energy in simpler forms so how
this<00:03:02.480> complex<00:03:02.989> food<00:03:03.290> are<00:03:03.560> converted<00:03:04.489> into

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
this complex food are converted into

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.970 
this complex food are converted into
simpler<00:03:05.300> food<00:03:05.630> that<00:03:06.080> also<00:03:06.350> we<00:03:06.650> will<00:03:06.800> talk

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
simpler food that also we will talk

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.290 
simpler food that also we will talk
about<00:03:07.160> in<00:03:07.870> nutrition<00:03:08.870> right<00:03:09.650> so<00:03:10.640> not<00:03:11.000> only

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
about in nutrition right so not only

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.330 
about in nutrition right so not only
animals<00:03:11.480> in<00:03:11.900> case<00:03:12.110> of<00:03:12.260> plants<00:03:12.500> also<00:03:13.010> we<00:03:13.160> see

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
animals in case of plants also we see

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.960 
animals in case of plants also we see
that<00:03:13.370> we<00:03:13.700> get<00:03:13.880> fruits<00:03:14.420> flowers<00:03:14.630> etc<00:03:15.140> and<00:03:15.970> these

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
that we get fruits flowers etc and these

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.720 
that we get fruits flowers etc and these
plants<00:03:17.450> also<00:03:17.630> need<00:03:17.870> food<00:03:18.350> as<00:03:18.530> well<00:03:18.769> because<00:03:19.280> if

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
plants also need food as well because if

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.940 
plants also need food as well because if
you<00:03:19.940> do<00:03:20.090> not<00:03:20.120> what<00:03:20.780> what<00:03:21.080> how<00:03:21.410> does<00:03:21.470> the<00:03:21.739> plant

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
you do not what what how does the plant

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.620 
you do not what what how does the plant
get<00:03:22.250> food<00:03:22.550> we<00:03:22.820> will<00:03:22.880> talk<00:03:23.090> about<00:03:23.269> that<00:03:23.570> later

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
get food we will talk about that later

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.229 
get food we will talk about that later
but<00:03:24.170> for<00:03:24.350> now<00:03:24.500> you<00:03:24.560> can<00:03:24.680> think<00:03:25.459> that<00:03:25.640> if<00:03:25.910> we

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
but for now you can think that if we

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.500 
but for now you can think that if we
don't<00:03:26.480> give<00:03:27.290> proper<00:03:28.040> water<00:03:28.580> if<00:03:29.090> we<00:03:29.120> do<00:03:29.390> not

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
don't give proper water if we do not

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.960 
don't give proper water if we do not
allow<00:03:29.870> proper<00:03:30.739> sunlight<00:03:31.310> befallen<00:03:31.760> the

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
allow proper sunlight befallen the

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.360 
allow proper sunlight befallen the
plants<00:03:32.360> they<00:03:32.780> tend<00:03:33.080> to<00:03:33.140> dry<00:03:33.440> up<00:03:33.650> they<00:03:34.100> do<00:03:34.220> not

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
plants they tend to dry up they do not

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.640 
plants they tend to dry up they do not
they<00:03:34.610> do<00:03:35.000> not<00:03:35.060> leave<00:03:35.450> under<00:03:35.840> such<00:03:36.019> conditions

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
they do not leave under such conditions

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.280 
they do not leave under such conditions
right<00:03:36.890> so<00:03:37.340> even<00:03:37.610> plants<00:03:38.360> also<00:03:38.540> need<00:03:38.690> energy

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
right so even plants also need energy

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.229 
right so even plants also need energy
and<00:03:39.440> that<00:03:39.560> is<00:03:39.739> wrong<00:03:39.890> even<00:03:39.920> plants<00:03:40.519> also<00:03:40.730> need

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
and that is wrong even plants also need

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.940 
and that is wrong even plants also need
food<00:03:43.120> correct<00:03:44.209> so<00:03:44.930> this<00:03:45.140> is<00:03:45.350> this<00:03:45.560> is<00:03:45.620> what

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
food correct so this is this is what

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.539 
food correct so this is this is what
where<00:03:46.790> we<00:03:47.090> show<00:03:47.630> the<00:03:47.780> necessity<00:03:48.380> of<00:03:48.549> nutrients

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
where we show the necessity of nutrients

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:50.170 
where we show the necessity of nutrients
for<00:03:49.670> the<00:03:49.730> plants

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
for the plants

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.479 
for the plants
so<00:03:50.450> not<00:03:50.630> only<00:03:50.900> water<00:03:51.080> and<00:03:51.350> sunlight<00:03:51.620> there<00:03:52.340> are

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
so not only water and sunlight there are

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.460 
so not only water and sunlight there are
so<00:03:52.670> many<00:03:52.790> other<00:03:53.120> nutrients<00:03:53.840> which<00:03:54.049> are<00:03:54.170> needed

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
so many other nutrients which are needed

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.259 
so many other nutrients which are needed
by<00:03:54.650> a<00:03:54.680> plant<00:03:55.340> for<00:03:55.610> example<00:03:55.670> you<00:03:56.060> would<00:03:56.180> have

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
by a plant for example you would have

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.140 
by a plant for example you would have
seen<00:03:56.450> that<00:03:56.690> in<00:03:57.320> your<00:03:57.470> garden<00:03:57.890> also<00:03:58.070> the<00:03:58.730> garden

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
seen that in your garden also the garden

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.810 
seen that in your garden also the garden
will<00:03:59.269> often<00:03:59.690> enriches<00:04:00.200> the<00:04:00.530> soil<00:04:00.560> with<00:04:01.430> so

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
will often enriches the soil with so

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.810 
will often enriches the soil with so
many<00:04:01.970> different<00:04:03.070> fertilizers<00:04:04.070> and<00:04:04.250> manuals

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
many different fertilizers and manuals

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.180 
many different fertilizers and manuals
so<00:04:05.030> that<00:04:05.209> the<00:04:05.450> soil<00:04:05.750> on<00:04:05.959> which<00:04:06.170> the<00:04:06.530> plant<00:04:06.920> is

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
so that the soil on which the plant is

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.130 
so that the soil on which the plant is
planted<00:04:07.310> it<00:04:07.940> is<00:04:08.209> enriched<00:04:08.660> with<00:04:08.840> many

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
planted it is enriched with many

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.900 
planted it is enriched with many
minerals<00:04:09.620> which<00:04:09.830> are<00:04:10.010> needed<00:04:10.250> for<00:04:10.400> better

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
minerals which are needed for better

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:11.660 
minerals which are needed for better
grow

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
grow

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.110 
grow
and<00:04:11.790> development<00:04:12.480> of<00:04:12.630> the<00:04:12.750> plant<00:04:13.430> okay<00:04:14.430> so<00:04:15.000> it

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
and development of the plant okay so it

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.060 
and development of the plant okay so it
is<00:04:15.150> not<00:04:15.480> only<00:04:15.630> about<00:04:15.870> plants<00:04:16.530> or<00:04:16.680> only<00:04:16.890> about

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
is not only about plants or only about

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.039 
is not only about plants or only about
human<00:04:17.609> beings<00:04:17.880> it<00:04:17.970> is<00:04:18.090> about<00:04:18.299> all<00:04:18.540> life-forms

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
human beings it is about all life-forms

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.410 
human beings it is about all life-forms
which<00:04:19.590> is<00:04:19.739> existing<00:04:20.040> on<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.340> art<00:04:20.640> each<00:04:21.180> and

which is existing on the art each and

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.690 
which is existing on the art each and
every<00:04:21.780> life-form<00:04:21.989> needs<00:04:22.560> energy<00:04:22.830> and<00:04:23.250> that

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
every life-form needs energy and that

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.510 
every life-form needs energy and that
energy<00:04:23.960> directly<00:04:24.960> comes<00:04:25.260> from<00:04:25.560> the<00:04:25.710> food<00:04:25.920> now

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
energy directly comes from the food now

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.030 
energy directly comes from the food now
here<00:04:26.910> in<00:04:27.060> nutrition<00:04:27.660> we<00:04:27.780> will<00:04:27.960> talk<00:04:28.169> about<00:04:28.380> how

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
here in nutrition we will talk about how

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.550 
here in nutrition we will talk about how
that<00:04:29.070> food<00:04:30.000> is<00:04:30.180> obtained<00:04:30.570> by<00:04:30.690> an<00:04:30.810> organism<00:04:31.110> and

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
that food is obtained by an organism and

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.159 
that food is obtained by an organism and
how<00:04:32.040> that<00:04:32.340> complex<00:04:32.820> food<00:04:33.090> is<00:04:33.450> converted<00:04:34.020> into

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
how that complex food is converted into

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.870 
how that complex food is converted into
a<00:04:34.320> simpler<00:04:35.160> form<00:04:36.980> so<00:04:37.980> with<00:04:38.220> this<00:04:38.370> introduction

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
a simpler form so with this introduction

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.300 
a simpler form so with this introduction
on<00:04:39.210> nutrition<00:04:39.840> let<00:04:40.290> us<00:04:40.440> try<00:04:40.680> to<00:04:40.710> define

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
on nutrition let us try to define

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.490 
on nutrition let us try to define
nutrition<00:04:41.970> how<00:04:42.180> do<00:04:42.240> we<00:04:42.450> define<00:04:42.720> nutrition<00:04:43.320> it

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
nutrition how do we define nutrition it

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.890 
nutrition how do we define nutrition it
is<00:04:43.950> the<00:04:44.100> process<00:04:44.400> of<00:04:44.760> obtaining<00:04:44.970> food<00:04:45.600> and

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
is the process of obtaining food and

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.870 
is the process of obtaining food and
changing<00:04:46.770> it<00:04:47.010> into<00:04:47.280> simple<00:04:47.810> absorbable<00:04:48.810> form

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
changing it into simple absorbable form

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.240 
changing it into simple absorbable form
right<00:04:50.880> now<00:04:51.180> the<00:04:52.050> question<00:04:52.290> is<00:04:52.680> why<00:04:53.190> do

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
right now the question is why do

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.940 
right now the question is why do
organisms<00:04:53.820> need<00:04:54.419> food<00:04:54.660> at<00:04:54.870> all<00:04:55.050> the<00:04:55.620> first

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
organisms need food at all the first

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.770 
organisms need food at all the first
thing<00:04:56.250> the<00:04:56.490> basic<00:04:56.850> thing<00:04:57.030> is<00:04:57.180> it<00:04:57.360> provides

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
thing the basic thing is it provides

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.010 
thing the basic thing is it provides
energy<00:04:58.490> now<00:04:59.490> how<00:04:59.730> it<00:05:00.000> provides<00:05:00.390> energy<00:05:00.600> and

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
energy now how it provides energy and

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.570 
energy now how it provides energy and
how<00:05:01.140> the<00:05:01.200> process<00:05:01.650> takes<00:05:01.860> place<00:05:01.950> we<00:05:02.250> will<00:05:02.370> talk

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
how the process takes place we will talk

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
how the process takes place we will talk
about<00:05:02.730> all<00:05:03.060> that<00:05:03.300> also<00:05:03.890> the<00:05:04.890> food<00:05:05.100> contains

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
about all that also the food contains

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.740 
about all that also the food contains
nutrients<00:05:06.600> for<00:05:07.440> example<00:05:08.070> you<00:05:09.060> have<00:05:09.270> different

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
nutrients for example you have different

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.659 
nutrients for example you have different
types<00:05:09.960> of<00:05:10.230> foods<00:05:10.560> which<00:05:11.430> food<00:05:11.880> which<00:05:12.630> are

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669 
types of foods which food which are

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:15.650 
types of foods which food which are
enriched<00:05:14.669> with<00:05:14.850> different<00:05:15.240> types<00:05:15.450> of

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
enriched with different types of

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.780 
enriched with different types of
nutrients<00:05:16.140> for<00:05:16.260> example<00:05:16.800> there<00:05:16.950> are<00:05:17.010> food

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:17.790 
nutrients for example there are food

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.020 
nutrients for example there are food
like<00:05:18.030> rice<00:05:18.380> or<00:05:19.380> potato<00:05:20.040> which<00:05:20.370> are<00:05:20.490> rich<00:05:20.850> in

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
like rice or potato which are rich in

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.510 
like rice or potato which are rich in
carbohydrates<00:05:21.680> similarly<00:05:22.680> you<00:05:22.800> have<00:05:22.830> pulses

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
carbohydrates similarly you have pulses

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.430 
carbohydrates similarly you have pulses
which<00:05:23.700> are<00:05:23.820> very<00:05:23.970> rich<00:05:24.090> in<00:05:24.240> proteins<00:05:24.870> you<00:05:25.410> have

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
which are very rich in proteins you have

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.790 
which are very rich in proteins you have
fruits<00:05:25.950> and<00:05:26.900> vegetables<00:05:27.900> the<00:05:28.590> green

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
fruits and vegetables the green

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.980 
fruits and vegetables the green
vegetables<00:05:29.070> and<00:05:29.760> fruits<00:05:30.150> which<00:05:30.419> are<00:05:30.570> rich<00:05:30.750> in

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
vegetables and fruits which are rich in

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.070 
vegetables and fruits which are rich in
vitamins<00:05:31.470> minerals<00:05:32.070> right<00:05:32.580> you<00:05:33.570> have<00:05:33.750> milk

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
vitamins minerals right you have milk

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.380 
vitamins minerals right you have milk
which<00:05:34.320> is<00:05:34.470> rich<00:05:34.620> in<00:05:34.860> calcium<00:05:35.100> and<00:05:35.640> phosphorus

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:36.390 
which is rich in calcium and phosphorus

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.230 
which is rich in calcium and phosphorus
so<00:05:36.930> you<00:05:37.200> have<00:05:37.470> different<00:05:38.100> food<00:05:38.460> materials

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
so you have different food materials

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.210 
so you have different food materials
which<00:05:39.510> are<00:05:39.690> enriched<00:05:40.229> with<00:05:40.440> different<00:05:40.860> kinds

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
which are enriched with different kinds

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.840 
which are enriched with different kinds
of<00:05:41.370> nutrients<00:05:41.910> and<00:05:41.970> our<00:05:42.540> body<00:05:42.900> needs

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:43.850 
of nutrients and our body needs

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.460 
of nutrients and our body needs
different<00:05:44.850> types<00:05:45.030> of<00:05:45.270> nutrients<00:05:45.810> for<00:05:46.229> many

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
different types of nutrients for many

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:47.840 
different types of nutrients for many
income<00:05:46.800> performing<00:05:47.310> many<00:05:47.460> different

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:47.850 
income performing many different

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.659 
income performing many different
activities<00:05:48.260> not<00:05:49.260> only<00:05:49.320> that<00:05:49.710> food<00:05:50.040> helps<00:05:50.460> and

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
activities not only that food helps and

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:52.969 
activities not only that food helps and
cell<00:05:50.910> repair<00:05:51.360> and<00:05:51.660> cell<00:05:51.930> growth<00:05:52.260> so<00:05:52.560> why<00:05:52.710> does

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
cell repair and cell growth so why does

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:55.370 
cell repair and cell growth so why does
a<00:05:53.100> cell<00:05:53.460> actually<00:05:53.940> need<00:05:54.479> energy<00:05:54.990> because

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
a cell actually need energy because

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:56.399 
a cell actually need energy because
sometimes<00:05:55.770> a<00:05:55.919> cell

00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:56.409 
sometimes a cell

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:58.919 
sometimes a cell
get<00:05:56.830> damaged<00:05:57.339> so<00:05:57.849> for<00:05:58.029> the<00:05:58.179> repair<00:05:58.509> of<00:05:58.539> that

00:05:58.919 --> 00:05:58.929 
get damaged so for the repair of that

00:05:58.929 --> 00:06:00.989 
get damaged so for the repair of that
saying<00:05:59.199> we<00:05:59.349> need<00:05:59.499> some<00:05:59.709> energy<00:05:59.830> similarly<00:06:00.789> for

00:06:00.989 --> 00:06:00.999 
saying we need some energy similarly for

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:03.269 
saying we need some energy similarly for
the<00:06:01.059> growth<00:06:01.300> of<00:06:01.449> the<00:06:01.659> cell<00:06:01.869> the<00:06:02.649> growth<00:06:02.949> of<00:06:03.159> the

00:06:03.269 --> 00:06:03.279 
the growth of the cell the growth of the

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:04.979 
the growth of the cell the growth of the
leading<00:06:03.459> organism<00:06:04.119> is<00:06:04.209> because<00:06:04.509> the<00:06:04.689> number

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:04.989 
leading organism is because the number

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:07.079 
leading organism is because the number
of<00:06:05.019> cells<00:06:05.319> increases<00:06:05.949> all<00:06:06.129> because<00:06:06.729> the<00:06:06.909> cell

00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:07.089 
of cells increases all because the cell

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:09.179 
of cells increases all because the cell
size<00:06:07.389> increases<00:06:08.050> so<00:06:08.409> for<00:06:08.589> both<00:06:08.739> of<00:06:08.800> them<00:06:09.129> we

00:06:09.179 --> 00:06:09.189 
size increases so for both of them we

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:12.329 
size increases so for both of them we
need<00:06:09.519> energy<00:06:09.999> so<00:06:10.389> that<00:06:10.419> is<00:06:10.659> why<00:06:10.839> we<00:06:11.619> need<00:06:11.830> phone

00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:12.339 
need energy so that is why we need phone

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:15.239 
need energy so that is why we need phone
it<00:06:12.939> also<00:06:13.179> increases<00:06:13.719> resistance<00:06:14.619> against

00:06:15.239 --> 00:06:15.249 
it also increases resistance against

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:17.389 
it also increases resistance against
diseases<00:06:15.699> you<00:06:16.149> would<00:06:16.269> have<00:06:16.419> seen<00:06:16.719> that<00:06:16.959> people

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:17.399 
diseases you would have seen that people

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:19.949 
diseases you would have seen that people
often<00:06:18.399> say<00:06:18.610> that<00:06:19.089> if<00:06:19.269> you<00:06:19.389> do<00:06:19.449> not<00:06:19.629> eat

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:19.959 
often say that if you do not eat

00:06:19.959 --> 00:06:22.829 
often say that if you do not eat
properly<00:06:20.199> you<00:06:21.159> will<00:06:21.339> fall<00:06:21.610> even<00:06:21.909> soon<00:06:22.330> by

00:06:22.829 --> 00:06:22.839 
properly you will fall even soon by

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:25.109 
properly you will fall even soon by
that's<00:06:23.229> because<00:06:23.559> when<00:06:23.739> we<00:06:23.889> eat<00:06:24.129> well<00:06:24.459> we

00:06:25.109 --> 00:06:25.119 
that's because when we eat well we

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:27.329 
that's because when we eat well we
actually<00:06:25.599> provide<00:06:25.989> our<00:06:26.259> body<00:06:26.649> with<00:06:26.949> all<00:06:27.069> the

00:06:27.329 --> 00:06:27.339 
actually provide our body with all the

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:29.669 
actually provide our body with all the
necessary<00:06:27.459> nutrients<00:06:28.330> so<00:06:28.839> the<00:06:28.989> body<00:06:29.229> stays

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:29.679 
necessary nutrients so the body stays

00:06:29.679 --> 00:06:31.769 
necessary nutrients so the body stays
healthy<00:06:29.949> and<00:06:30.189> as<00:06:30.489> a<00:06:30.519> result<00:06:30.999> the<00:06:31.389> immune

00:06:31.769 --> 00:06:31.779 
healthy and as a result the immune

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:33.749 
healthy and as a result the immune
system<00:06:32.289> of<00:06:32.409> the<00:06:32.439> body<00:06:32.589> grows<00:06:33.159> strong<00:06:33.519> that

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:33.759 
system of the body grows strong that

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:36.059 
system of the body grows strong that
what<00:06:33.939> this<00:06:34.119> immune<00:06:34.419> system<00:06:34.839> immune<00:06:35.289> system<00:06:35.949> is

00:06:36.059 --> 00:06:36.069 
what this immune system immune system is

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:37.979 
what this immune system immune system is
the<00:06:36.219> reserve<00:06:36.610> is<00:06:36.819> the<00:06:36.969> soldier<00:06:37.389> of<00:06:37.539> our<00:06:37.689> body

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:37.989 
the reserve is the soldier of our body

00:06:37.989 --> 00:06:39.869 
the reserve is the soldier of our body
it<00:06:38.289> actually<00:06:38.379> helps<00:06:38.919> to<00:06:39.069> fight<00:06:39.309> against

00:06:39.869 --> 00:06:39.879 
it actually helps to fight against

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:42.029 
it actually helps to fight against
infections<00:06:40.539> it<00:06:40.929> helps<00:06:41.199> to<00:06:41.319> fight<00:06:41.529> against

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:42.039 
infections it helps to fight against

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:44.399 
infections it helps to fight against
diseases<00:06:42.699> so<00:06:43.149> if<00:06:43.269> your<00:06:43.419> body<00:06:43.689> is<00:06:43.929> healthy<00:06:44.169> your

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:44.409 
diseases so if your body is healthy your

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:46.769 
diseases so if your body is healthy your
immune<00:06:44.829> system<00:06:45.219> is<00:06:45.339> stronger<00:06:45.819> and<00:06:46.029> you<00:06:46.569> will

00:06:46.769 --> 00:06:46.779 
immune system is stronger and you will

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:51.119 
immune system is stronger and you will
tend<00:06:47.169> to<00:06:47.349> get<00:06:48.279> diseases<00:06:48.789> less<00:06:49.719> right<00:06:50.709> so<00:06:51.099> I

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:51.129 
tend to get diseases less right so I

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:53.309 
tend to get diseases less right so I
have<00:06:51.429> discussed<00:06:52.209> about<00:06:52.360> the<00:06:52.749> immune<00:06:52.959> system

00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:53.319 
have discussed about the immune system

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:58.649 
have discussed about the immune system
in<00:06:53.439> detail<00:06:53.559> in<00:06:53.919> class<00:06:54.129> 9<00:06:55.829> correct<00:06:56.889> so<00:06:57.789> the

00:06:58.649 --> 00:06:58.659 
in detail in class 9 correct so the

00:06:58.659 --> 00:07:02.609 
in detail in class 9 correct so the
immunity<00:06:59.319> of<00:06:59.469> the<00:06:59.499> body<00:06:59.860> also<00:07:00.300> increases<00:07:01.619> okay

00:07:02.609 --> 00:07:02.619 
immunity of the body also increases okay

00:07:02.619 --> 00:07:04.769 
immunity of the body also increases okay
so<00:07:03.189> quickly<00:07:03.519> let<00:07:03.669> us<00:07:03.819> look<00:07:03.939> at<00:07:04.119> this<00:07:04.300> what<00:07:04.599> are

00:07:04.769 --> 00:07:04.779 
so quickly let us look at this what are

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:07.379 
so quickly let us look at this what are
nutrients<00:07:05.619> so<00:07:06.339> here<00:07:06.639> we<00:07:06.819> have<00:07:06.939> defined

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:07.389 
nutrients so here we have defined

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:09.209 
nutrients so here we have defined
nutrients<00:07:07.959> a<00:07:08.050> substance<00:07:08.559> that<00:07:08.679> provides

00:07:09.209 --> 00:07:09.219 
nutrients a substance that provides

00:07:09.219 --> 00:07:11.429 
nutrients a substance that provides
nourishment<00:07:09.659> needed<00:07:10.659> for<00:07:10.899> growth<00:07:11.110> and

00:07:11.429 --> 00:07:11.439 
nourishment needed for growth and

00:07:11.439 --> 00:07:14.489 
nourishment needed for growth and
maintenance<00:07:11.860> of<00:07:12.309> life<00:07:12.610> so<00:07:13.300> every<00:07:14.079> living

00:07:14.489 --> 00:07:14.499 
maintenance of life so every living

00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:18.089 
maintenance of life so every living
organism<00:07:14.679> need<00:07:15.369> nutrients<00:07:16.059> for<00:07:16.539> its<00:07:17.099> proper

00:07:18.089 --> 00:07:18.099 
organism need nutrients for its proper

00:07:18.099 --> 00:07:21.299 
organism need nutrients for its proper
growth<00:07:18.399> and<00:07:18.699> development<00:07:19.679> right<00:07:20.679> so<00:07:21.099> now<00:07:21.219> we

00:07:21.299 --> 00:07:21.309 
growth and development right so now we

00:07:21.309 --> 00:07:24.329 
growth and development right so now we
understood<00:07:21.909> what<00:07:22.269> this<00:07:22.449> nutrition<00:07:23.339> nutrition

00:07:24.329 --> 00:07:24.339 
understood what this nutrition nutrition
