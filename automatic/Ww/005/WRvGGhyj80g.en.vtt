00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 let's go now to the fabric like that and 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.309
 our dearest Andrea is going to 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.130
 teach how to make a tunic but in 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.530
 this clear case is a woven tunic and 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.719
 It's a tunic that you have to wear down 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.660
 something because the salomon point is a point 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.980
 very very wide is made to crochet 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.720
 it's not like that because sometimes what happens with 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.300
 Andrea because Andrea does both 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.609
 from over there that crochet and two needles 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.320
 well I do not want to talk anymore I want to go 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.790
 directly with her who is going to spend 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.219
 explain how this tunic is made 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:39.870
 hello how about thank you marisa if we go to 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:43.440
 make a robe today we come something between 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.649
 modern / retro so they can use it 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.770
 both the big people to get out of 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.800
 night or young girls with a jean 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.620
 with a small toy or a remerita 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.649
 because not to go dancing and good if 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.130
 you think we can go see the 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.360
 molds 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:06.880
 and good thing we have here is this tunic is 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.600
 made both back and front of the 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:14.320
 same way there are very few points because 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.750
 is worked with a number 6 needle in 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.230
 crochet so let's make a 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:23.260
 rectangle and the sleeves then they go to 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:27.220
 be worked directly from the 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:30.280
 garment so good now if you think 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:36.010
 I'm going to show you how this is done 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:39.700
 point that is called Solomon and we are 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:42.400
 seeing barbara you see is a point 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.860
 very open but that is very sexy 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.380
 you imagine with any color 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:51.040
 it looks good too, the sleeves are not 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:54.340
 spacious and it's very easy to do is a 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.440
 I really work that when you 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.170
 grab your hand to make this point 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.780
 then it does not have any kind of problem 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.870
 so good girls if you think 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.450
 we can start to see how this point is 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.369
 and I brought her the garment is made more 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.450
 little ones so that you have 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:17.160
 idea of â€‹â€‹how we are going to work this what 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:21.550
 let's do on a string basis with 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:24.400
 a round of twists after we go to 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.550
 work this solomon point 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.770
 or we can also call it a 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.660
 string stretched for you to see 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.120
 which is easy to do 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.910
 let's work both forward and 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.920
 back in the same way and good now 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.030
 I 'm going to show you how this is done 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.450
 point 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.430
 let's see the first round I do not know 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.910
 forget I worked with a base of 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:53.390
 chains and one after a spin of 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:58.900
 we will start from the next 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:03.099
 way we're going to make a half point 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:06.040
 let's stretch this point that we were left 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:09.459
 and we will do as if as if 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:14.609
 let's make a chain right there 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:17.769
 let's work a half point we close 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:20.799
 we stretch and close again as if 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:24.579
 let's make a chain and that's where we started 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:28.030
 our work we counted 2 4 6 in the 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:32.170
 seventh we go back to making a half point 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:34.230
 do not get scared it 's easy, we're going to do it 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.409
 again we made the half point 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:43.349
 we stretch do we close chain 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:48.780
 we make another half point stretch 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:48.780
 we close again we count again 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:57.010
 246 in the seventh half point 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.570
 let's go again is until we grab 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.570
 hands stretch 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.930
 and we do 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.350
 we close the chain we make a medium 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.160
 point 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:17.010
 and we stretch again we close again 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:21.209
 the chain and so we count 2 4 6 in the 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:24.330
 seventh we make a half point as 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.490
 let's start the next round I 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.430
 I want to show you here because they want 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:34.080
 like a little flower like we're going to do 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:37.140
 so that this flower is armed we are going to 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:43.710
 doing so will upload them four 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:47.670
 points chains 1 2 3 4 the room 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:49.840
 we stretch what we do we close the chain 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:53.980
 Y 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:58.330
 here where we had the union of 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:05:02.199
 that half point we're going to click and go 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:05.460
 to make another half point more if we go 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:09.270
 again we stretch 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:11.970
 We close yes and here we will not pass 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.099
 we can click here but we have to 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:17.580
 make the point that will follow us in the 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:22.319
 next round we make a half point 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:24.210
 we go back to stretch we close again and 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:26.970
 now 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:31.880
 here we have the half point of the turn 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.880
 previous we click again in the middle 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:41.710
 we make a half point again 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:43.889
 and we go back to stretch we close 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:48.710
 we make 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:53.270
 a half point that we stretch 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:55.880
 we close the chain and see we have here 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.340
 again we do click in the middle of 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.470
 half a point from the previous round 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:05.210
 we stretch closed and how are we going to 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:09.200
 finish the lap very easy a double 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:12.740
 untreated crochet at half a point 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:16.520
 the previous round so girls are going to 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:19.130
 work all the laps the first the 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.230
 we start with a half point the second 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.750
 we started it with four varetas and 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:26.480
 we start again with a half point 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:28.580
 we're going to do the sleeves once 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.440
 we have finished the front one 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:34.940
 Once we also have finished the 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:37.670
 back we join the shoulders with 9 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:41.200
 centimeters with one with one turn of 

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:43.910
 just as we do 

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.800
 remember the low point is like the 

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:49.460
 half point 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.599
 without doing or we close directly 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:54.680
 what do we do 

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:56.940
 we take 28 centimeters of the back 28 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:01.020
 centimeters from the front 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:03.840
 let's leave the point that we just made a 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:07.090
 Once we have 33 centimeters cut 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:11.030

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:14.810
 We auction and sew we always go to 

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:17.300
 leave 26 centimeters of two pits of 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:19.640
 each side now good if you think 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:23.090
 we can go see the materials 

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:26.720
 for this we are going to need 300 grams 

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:30.200
 of loops and a crochet needle number 6 

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:33.430
