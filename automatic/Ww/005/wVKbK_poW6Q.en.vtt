00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
and like an ink dipping pen before ever

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.170 
and like an ink dipping pen before ever
I've<00:02:05.530> used<00:02:05.770> fountain<00:02:06.310> pens<00:02:06.549> we<00:02:06.790> used<00:02:06.939> to<00:02:07.030> write

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
I've used fountain pens we used to write

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.109 
I've used fountain pens we used to write
with<00:02:07.360> them<00:02:07.509> in<00:02:07.890> university<00:02:08.890> of<00:02:09.160> the

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
with them in university of the

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.940 
with them in university of the
University<00:02:10.539> in<00:02:10.569> school<00:02:10.959> primary<00:02:11.440> school<00:02:11.470> even

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
University in school primary school even

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.410 
University in school primary school even
a<00:02:12.160> long<00:02:12.700> way<00:02:12.849> off<00:02:13.000> University<00:02:13.239> and

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
a long way off University and

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.080 
a long way off University and
and<00:02:14.480> I<00:02:14.980> like<00:02:15.980> using<00:02:16.220> fountain<00:02:16.670> pens<00:02:16.849> but<00:02:17.000> I've

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
and I like using fountain pens but I've

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.940 
and I like using fountain pens but I've
never<00:02:17.180> used<00:02:17.300> a<00:02:17.480> dipping<00:02:17.840> pen<00:02:18.050> and<00:02:18.290> this<00:02:18.739> was

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
never used a dipping pen and this was

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.290 
never used a dipping pen and this was
just<00:02:19.030> crazy

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
just crazy

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.120 
just crazy
it<00:02:20.510> was<00:02:20.690> just<00:02:20.900> like<00:02:21.050> constantly<00:02:21.590> dipping<00:02:21.980> it

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
it was just like constantly dipping it

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.040 
it was just like constantly dipping it
like<00:02:22.340> I<00:02:22.550> didn't<00:02:23.150> know<00:02:23.239> that<00:02:23.450> it<00:02:23.630> wouldn't<00:02:23.870> hold

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
like I didn't know that it wouldn't hold

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.900 
like I didn't know that it wouldn't hold
a<00:02:24.260> lot<00:02:24.410> of<00:02:24.440> ink<00:02:24.890> and<00:02:25.720> so<00:02:26.720> I<00:02:27.670> found<00:02:28.670> it<00:02:28.790> really

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
a lot of ink and so I found it really

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.130 
a lot of ink and so I found it really
hard<00:02:29.060> to<00:02:29.390> get<00:02:29.599> the<00:02:29.690> balance<00:02:29.870> right<00:02:30.319> of<00:02:31.720> ink<00:02:32.720> and

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
hard to get the balance right of ink and

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.900 
hard to get the balance right of ink and
sort<00:02:33.650> of<00:02:34.480> you<00:02:35.480> know<00:02:35.540> not<00:02:36.250> having<00:02:37.250> to<00:02:37.400> dip<00:02:37.610> it<00:02:37.760> so

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
sort of you know not having to dip it so

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.610 
sort of you know not having to dip it so
often<00:02:38.239> I<00:02:38.390> don't<00:02:38.569> know<00:02:38.630> I've<00:02:39.080> never<00:02:39.319> used<00:02:39.530> it

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
often I don't know I've never used it

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.780 
often I don't know I've never used it
first<00:02:39.890> I<00:02:39.980> don't<00:02:40.130> know<00:02:40.190> if<00:02:40.280> I<00:02:40.340> was<00:02:40.489> doing<00:02:40.580> it

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
first I don't know if I was doing it

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.759 
first I don't know if I was doing it
right<00:02:40.940> I<00:02:41.239> was<00:02:41.720> such<00:02:41.870> an<00:02:41.989> amateur<00:02:42.200> so<00:02:42.560> it<00:02:42.620> was<00:02:42.739> a

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
right I was such an amateur so it was a

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.440 
right I was such an amateur so it was a
completely<00:02:43.400> new<00:02:43.580> experience<00:02:43.849> for<00:02:44.330> me

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
completely new experience for me

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.620 
completely new experience for me
entirely<00:02:44.900> and<00:02:45.260> it<00:02:46.130> was<00:02:46.280> kind<00:02:46.580> of<00:02:46.640> fun<00:02:46.880> so<00:02:47.269> I'm

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
entirely and it was kind of fun so I'm

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.930 
entirely and it was kind of fun so I'm
not<00:02:47.810> sure<00:02:47.959> if<00:02:48.019> I'd<00:02:48.140> do<00:02:48.230> it<00:02:48.350> again<00:02:48.459> like<00:02:49.459> on<00:02:49.880> a

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
not sure if I'd do it again like on a

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.880 
not sure if I'd do it again like on a
regular<00:02:50.150> basis<00:02:50.840> I<00:02:50.989> prefer<00:02:51.440> things<00:02:51.739> like

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
regular basis I prefer things like

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.270 
regular basis I prefer things like
brushes<00:02:52.310> and<00:02:52.840> softer<00:02:53.840> things<00:02:54.069> but<00:02:55.069> it<00:02:55.160> was

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
brushes and softer things but it was

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.470 
brushes and softer things but it was
nice<00:02:55.430> to<00:02:55.670> get<00:02:55.760> like<00:02:55.940> different<00:02:56.269> line<00:02:56.450> weights

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
nice to get like different line weights

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.070 
nice to get like different line weights
as<00:02:56.989> well<00:02:57.019> as<00:02:58.120> sort<00:02:59.120> of<00:02:59.180> just<00:02:59.330> experimenting

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
as well as sort of just experimenting

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.530 
as well as sort of just experimenting
with<00:03:00.290> something<00:03:01.280> completely<00:03:02.090> different<00:03:02.120> to

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
with something completely different to

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.220 
with something completely different to
what<00:03:02.660> I<00:03:02.690> normally<00:03:02.840> do<00:03:03.170> and<00:03:04.420> yeah<00:03:05.420> I've<00:03:05.660> slowed

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
what I normally do and yeah I've slowed

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.900 
what I normally do and yeah I've slowed
bits<00:03:06.500> of<00:03:06.620> this<00:03:06.739> video<00:03:07.040> down<00:03:07.280> so<00:03:07.459> you<00:03:07.549> can<00:03:07.670> kind

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
bits of this video down so you can kind

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.870 
bits of this video down so you can kind
of<00:03:07.970> see<00:03:08.180> details<00:03:08.630> with<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:10.489> way<00:03:10.640> that<00:03:10.760> I've

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
of see details with the way that I've

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.640 
of see details with the way that I've
approached<00:03:11.209> it<00:03:11.420> or<00:03:12.049> little<00:03:12.260> bits<00:03:12.410> that<00:03:12.560> I

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
approached it or little bits that I

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.860 
approached it or little bits that I
thought<00:03:12.890> would<00:03:13.880> look<00:03:13.910> a<00:03:14.120> bit<00:03:14.299> better<00:03:14.330> slower

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
thought would look a bit better slower

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.900 
thought would look a bit better slower
so<00:03:15.590> let<00:03:15.830> me<00:03:15.920> know<00:03:16.040> if<00:03:16.160> you<00:03:16.250> like<00:03:16.370> that<00:03:16.580> kind<00:03:16.819> of

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
so let me know if you like that kind of

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.120 
so let me know if you like that kind of
format<00:03:17.330> instead<00:03:17.720> of<00:03:17.900> because<00:03:18.650> I<00:03:18.680> was<00:03:19.010> debating

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
format instead of because I was debating

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.630 
format instead of because I was debating
doing<00:03:19.790> some<00:03:20.299> slower<00:03:20.540> length<00:03:20.810> videos<00:03:21.230> and

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
doing some slower length videos and

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.270 
doing some slower length videos and
uploading<00:03:22.640> them<00:03:22.900> as<00:03:23.900> unlisted<00:03:24.500> videos<00:03:24.890> so<00:03:25.190> you

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
uploading them as unlisted videos so you

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.550 
uploading them as unlisted videos so you
could<00:03:25.430> kind<00:03:25.670> of<00:03:25.730> see<00:03:25.910> both<00:03:26.660> processes<00:03:27.200> but

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
could kind of see both processes but

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.759 
could kind of see both processes but
that<00:03:27.709> would<00:03:27.890> take<00:03:27.920> me<00:03:28.340> a<00:03:28.370> lot<00:03:28.579> of<00:03:28.609> time<00:03:28.910> and<00:03:29.150> I

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
that would take me a lot of time and I

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.080 
that would take me a lot of time and I
honestly<00:03:30.769> I<00:03:30.829> have<00:03:31.070> a<00:03:31.100> lot<00:03:31.310> of<00:03:31.430> other<00:03:31.760> stuff<00:03:32.060> to

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
honestly I have a lot of other stuff to

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.050 
honestly I have a lot of other stuff to
do<00:03:32.299> with<00:03:32.329> my<00:03:32.570> business<00:03:32.840> so<00:03:33.320> I<00:03:33.519> decided<00:03:34.519> to<00:03:34.640> just

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
do with my business so I decided to just

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.000 
do with my business so I decided to just
slow<00:03:35.390> down<00:03:35.420> a<00:03:35.630> few<00:03:35.900> bits<00:03:36.049> in<00:03:36.260> this<00:03:36.410> and<00:03:36.709> sort<00:03:36.950> of

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
slow down a few bits in this and sort of

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.800 
slow down a few bits in this and sort of
experiment<00:03:37.579> with<00:03:37.700> that<00:03:37.880> kind<00:03:38.150> of<00:03:38.180> format<00:03:38.570> for

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
experiment with that kind of format for

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.259 
experiment with that kind of format for
my<00:03:38.900> videos<00:03:39.200> so<00:03:39.530> if<00:03:39.769> you<00:03:40.280> like<00:03:40.489> that<00:03:40.760> please<00:03:41.030> let

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
my videos so if you like that please let

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.670 
my videos so if you like that please let
me<00:03:41.390> know<00:03:41.570> I<00:03:42.519> also<00:03:43.519> asked<00:03:43.850> merged<00:03:44.120> I<00:03:44.470> smudge<00:03:45.470> the

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
me know I also asked merged I smudge the

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.640 
me know I also asked merged I smudge the
ink<00:03:45.859> their<00:03:46.100> ink<00:03:46.700> is<00:03:46.880> very<00:03:47.150> unforgiving<00:03:47.660> but<00:03:48.620> I

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
ink their ink is very unforgiving but I

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.410 
ink their ink is very unforgiving but I
won't<00:03:48.920> start<00:03:49.220> using<00:03:49.579> ink<00:03:49.760> a<00:03:49.910> lot<00:03:50.030> more<00:03:50.239> with

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
won't start using ink a lot more with

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.380 
won't start using ink a lot more with
washes<00:03:50.870> and<00:03:51.049> things<00:03:51.260> like<00:03:51.470> that<00:03:51.680> but<00:03:52.390> you'll

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
washes and things like that but you'll

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
screenshots that i found on google

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.990 
screenshots that i found on google
images<00:05:43.690> but<00:05:44.690> yeah<00:05:44.990> so<00:05:45.400> the<00:05:46.400> tree<00:05:46.610> was<00:05:46.790> fun

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
images but yeah so the tree was fun

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.720 
images but yeah so the tree was fun
because<00:05:47.210> i'd<00:05:47.570> kind<00:05:47.870> of<00:05:47.990> got<00:05:48.140> used<00:05:48.320> to<00:05:48.530> the<00:05:49.490> flow

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:49.730 
because i'd kind of got used to the flow

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:51.490 
because i'd kind of got used to the flow
of<00:05:49.760> the<00:05:49.970> ink<00:05:50.150> and<00:05:50.360> the<00:05:50.450> pen<00:05:50.630> at<00:05:50.780> this<00:05:50.930> point<00:05:51.230> and

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
of the ink and the pen at this point and

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.230 
of the ink and the pen at this point and
so<00:05:52.070> i<00:05:52.100> started<00:05:52.460> to<00:05:52.580> fill<00:05:52.730> it<00:05:52.850> in<00:05:52.940> a<00:05:53.060> lot<00:05:53.210> more

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
so i started to fill it in a lot more

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.280 
so i started to fill it in a lot more
and<00:05:53.810> do<00:05:54.440> a<00:05:54.470> bit<00:05:54.680> more<00:05:54.850> blocking<00:05:55.990> with<00:05:56.990> the<00:05:57.110> ink

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:57.290 
and do a bit more blocking with the ink

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.900 
and do a bit more blocking with the ink
so<00:05:58.100> that<00:05:58.130> was<00:05:58.370> like<00:05:58.460> i'm<00:05:58.580> going<00:05:58.700> to<00:05:58.820> add

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:58.910

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.610 
so that was like i'm going to add
another<00:05:59.060> tree<00:05:59.510> so<00:05:59.690> i<00:05:59.720> have<00:05:59.930> is<00:06:00.080> it's<00:06:00.260> kind<00:06:00.560> of

another tree so i have is it's kind of
like<00:06:00.680> another<00:06:00.980> tree<00:06:01.340> a<00:06:01.370> little<00:06:01.790> bit<00:06:01.880> later<00:06:02.030> on

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
like another tree a little bit later on

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:08.170

of<00:06:15.650> the<00:06:15.770> red<00:06:16.100> ink<00:06:16.370> is<00:06:16.640> it's<00:06:17.390> really<00:06:18.140> really

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500 
of the red ink is it's really really

of the red ink is it's really really
bright<00:06:18.800> and<00:06:19.010> i<00:06:19.970> didn't<00:06:20.300> know<00:06:20.390> what<00:06:20.900> add<00:06:21.320> to<00:06:21.560> it

bright and i didn't know what add to it
i<00:06:21.740> was<00:06:21.860> thinking<00:06:22.130> of<00:06:22.190> adding<00:06:22.340> some<00:06:22.640> gray<00:06:22.940> just

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:23.720 
i was thinking of adding some gray just

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.610 
i was thinking of adding some gray just
for<00:06:23.900> toner<00:06:24.200> and<00:06:25.240> i<00:06:26.240> didn't<00:06:27.170> know<00:06:27.290> because<00:06:27.470> i

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
for toner and i didn't know because i

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.980 
for toner and i didn't know because i
thought<00:06:27.890> like<00:06:28.130> if<00:06:28.280> I<00:06:28.400> do<00:06:28.460> it<00:06:28.670> wrong<00:06:29.360> and<00:06:29.630> it

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:29.990 
thought like if I do it wrong and it

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.810 
thought like if I do it wrong and it
looks<00:06:30.230> absolutely<00:06:30.500> hideous<00:06:31.010> the<00:06:31.310> whole<00:06:31.520> thing

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:31.820

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:35.990
