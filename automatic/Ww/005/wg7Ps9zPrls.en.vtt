00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.130
 combact 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.090
 lace dorsini 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.090
 but how do you say thank you 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:14.279
 on the marble table 

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:17.279
 for roses in a glass 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.169
 troxerutin 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:24.169
 more than a table, it looks like a balcony 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:27.749
 it is a public place 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.529
 here are the tables 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.970
 elegant men with in-line cylinders 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.970
 for women with gloves 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.520
 there is also a show 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.520
 the mistress of the bracelet dressed provocatively 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.470
 active dress 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.950
 wide neckline framed by other guys 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.180
 that a mischievous holes 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.730
 a cameo in the neck 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.260
 lump sum 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
 however, the hands rest on the counter in a less than noble way 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.620
 there is therefore a familiarity for those hands and the mark ones 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.630
 they will move from there shortly to get one of those bottles pour 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.640
 a waitress in another cool job 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.130
 in a rare moment of nativity 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.900
 knitwear factory 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.900
 also the contrast with the malice of the costume 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.230
 the face 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.230
 from the grace of a tall country girl still here hotel 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.860
 evidently accustomed to simplicity 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.320
 the eyes are something else 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.210
 the hallucinated look 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.210
 driven by fatigue 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.180
 a mixture of sadness and bitterness 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.970
 norama the pure one needed to live 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.970
 which seems to be planted by that ambiguous world that surrounds it 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.740
 behind him a large mirror 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.740
 where all the beautiful people reflected except her 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.210
 because the black projection is his shoulders 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.129
 it's not his image 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.709
 if so 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.760
 the band of wood that crosses the mirror horizontally would not come 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.199
 covered by the choir 

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:19.199
 does not have its price 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:22.969
 you looked like a painter at another time 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:27.039
 struggling with that insinuating reality 

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:30.039
 embodied by a vicious gaze 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.219
 not by chance 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:35.099
 the only other pair of eyes of which 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.369
 that wisdom measures it 

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:40.369
 but presses on 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:44.859
 that place doesn't want on the sea 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:46.789
 he wants his part 

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:49.379
 she doesn't want to give herself 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.119
 but he cannot deny himself 

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:53.949
 yes. I am 

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:57.569
 this is the name that I thought I heard whispering to the gentleman puppies 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:02.909
 and then you love on a trapeze in the upper left 

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:04.689
 that the painter 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:06.469
 he wants to be seen 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:09.199
 I'm a third session 

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:12.149
 the show therefore 

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:15.949
 It is legal under the binoculars to ask if it will succeed in this 

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:18.149
 difficult balance game 

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:19.949
 - in Italian 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.569
 of necessity 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.539
 that world is waiting for me to be caught 

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:28.529
 because it's called 

00:03:28.529 --> 00:03:31.159
 here is why the if are in the foreground 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:34.159
 armed forces are held 

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:36.949
 we will never know 

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:39.949
 if a second later this brought still picture 

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:42.469
 we are crying 

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:44.399
 play we'll never know 

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:46.699
 what will have been pontifical 

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:50.809
 in the names of the many women who will take their place over time 

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:53.049
 in this dangerous acrobatics 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.439
 lends the name of the one who moved us with his tender heroine 

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:59.189
 in the first votes to the left 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:00.669
 edouard manet 

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:03.789
 1882 

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:05.059
 the place 

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:06.379
 for the bar of the folies-bergÃ¨re
