00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
they saw that in the first 45 minutes or

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.830 
they saw that in the first 45 minutes or
so<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:26.340> i<00:00:26.730> gotta<00:00:26.910> say<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.240> seems<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.660> bit

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
so and i gotta say it seems a bit

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.250 
so and i gotta say it seems a bit
suspicious<00:00:28.189> that<00:00:29.189> last<00:00:29.550> year<00:00:29.939> for<00:00:30.750> day<00:00:30.900> passes

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.680 
suspicious that last year for day passes
sold<00:00:31.439> out<00:00:31.590> in<00:00:31.800> eight<00:00:32.430> weeks<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.940> the

three-day<00:00:33.930> passes<00:00:34.140> i<00:00:34.320> don't<00:00:34.530> think<00:00:34.710> sold<00:00:34.920> out

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
three-day passes i don't think sold out

three-day passes i don't think sold out
until<00:00:35.309> September<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:36.090> seems<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.390> bit

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
until September it seems a bit

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.450 
until September it seems a bit
suspicious<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:37.200> me<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.070> took<00:00:38.160> so<00:00:38.340> long

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
suspicious to me that it took so long

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.340 
suspicious to me that it took so long
for<00:00:38.520> them<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.760> sell<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.090> last<00:00:39.300> year<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.660> in<00:00:40.110> one

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
for them to sell it last year and in one

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.860 
for them to sell it last year and in one
year's<00:00:40.590> time<00:00:40.680> they<00:00:41.670> somehow<00:00:41.940> just<00:00:42.270> sold<00:00:42.660> out

year's time they somehow just sold out
in<00:00:43.079> 45<00:00:43.500> minutes<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:44.640> me<00:00:44.820> that's<00:00:45.450> been<00:00:45.629> odd<00:00:45.780> I

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
in 45 minutes to me that's been odd I

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.440 
in 45 minutes to me that's been odd I
believe<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:46.739> comic<00:00:47.730> con<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:47.940> grown<00:00:48.210> in<00:00:48.239> that

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
believe that comic con is grown in that

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.119 
believe that comic con is grown in that
it<00:00:48.539> has<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.690> bigger<00:00:48.930> audience<00:00:49.110> now<00:00:49.440> but<00:00:49.890> there's

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
it has a bigger audience now but there's

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.880 
it has a bigger audience now but there's
no<00:00:50.190> way<00:00:50.629> that<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.780> grew<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.199> quickly<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:52.770> the

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
no way that it grew that quickly in the

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.920 
no way that it grew that quickly in the
past<00:00:53.129> year<00:00:53.489> so<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.149> alone<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:54.629> know<00:00:54.719> I'm<00:00:54.840> a

past year so that alone you know I'm a
bit<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.320> bit<00:00:55.860> cautious<00:00:56.039> about<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.699> I'm

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
bit of a bit cautious about that I'm

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.250 
bit of a bit cautious about that I'm
wondering<00:00:57.480> what's<00:00:57.629> going<00:00:57.750> on<00:00:57.960> there<00:00:58.109> might<00:00:58.230> be

wondering what's going on there might be

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.290 
wondering what's going on there might be
