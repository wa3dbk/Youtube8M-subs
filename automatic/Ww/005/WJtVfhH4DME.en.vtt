00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:07.220
 good the difference of management between 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.420
 British and Iberian and that's where maybe 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.890
 this the problem look we have the 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.600

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.849
 Andrew Hello good morning to you, nobody 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.339
 asks for your opinion in this matter and 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:21.589
 you also want to negotiate for 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:24.470
 course we want to negotiate we want 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:26.539
 negotiate the future of iberia we do not want 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.489
 negotiate its dismantling and much 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.919
 less the delivery of the company to the 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:33.110
 British to have the impression of 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:36.620
 that since the merger with british airways 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.420
 and today they are afraid and should not have 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.829
 done something other than losing 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:45.800
 I actually look, I can give you some 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:48.980
 small data before the merger that 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.449
 produced in 2011 iberia in the last 14 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.500
 have achieved 13 years of 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.940
 Benefits 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.550
 British airways only in both 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.190
 years before the merger lost almost a thousand 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.489
 millions of euros 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.559
 and after the merger in 2011 and to iberia 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.809
 announces losses of 60 million 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:08.080
 euros and older in this year of course 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.200
 and British airways happens to win only 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.240
 in 2011 more than 600 million euros 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.649
 he should also announce the dismissal of 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.810
 four thousand five hundred people while 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:18.460
 that british airways announced the 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.590
 hiring about two thousand people to 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.360
 first of this year iberia is detached 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.340
 of 25 aircraft when british airways 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.440
 4500 million euros invested in 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:31.530
 purchase of 53 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:43.390
 but at nothing 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:45.479
 does not understand that you do not see that you do not 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.149
 we understand 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.189
 this is understood assuming that what 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.549
 they wanted the English that was to stay 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:57.220
 with our heritage with iberia and with 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.189
 the Spanish air sector now announce 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.799
 also the acquisition of vueling 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.149
 they want to get their planes on the t4 a 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.429
 Once you understand that, you understand the 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.959
 economic situation of iberia andrÃ©s 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:09.399
 delegate of the trade union 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:10.899
 walk crew applies very 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.549
 well really thank you very much 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.480
 thank you for being in the morning of 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:16.230
 cope 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:21.549
 then when what situation so 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:24.670
 incomprehensible as I said if it looks me 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:27.310
 I know that topic I do not know 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.660
 also it surprised me a little sight 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.090
 from outside so I'm surprised 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.700
 little that Iiberia that I thought was going 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.310
 that is going well was very bad very bad very 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.620
 bad also surprised me look good 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.890
 then man this gentleman that there is 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.270
 talk because we are more data than him I 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.459
 I think that no one else does not sell it 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.959
 weird then I say yes 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.300
 that's how this man says that we're going 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:52.239
 which also does not have to because 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.500
 tales man feels more when all 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.569
 they are euros 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.430
 and the company to get ahead 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.709
 clear without divisions so many posts of 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.810
 work is not there what happens is that already 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.209
 I do not have to say it seems to me that I do not speak anymore 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.090
 multimedia but we talk about guides 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.680
 trip that has a couple of divisions that 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.980
 now he has three because now it seems that 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.319
 that vueling happens but not like 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.569
 subsidiary of iberia but it happens as 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.930
 one more a good so that has 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.370
 three 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:23.269
 iberia good 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:25.400
 and British I do not know what role he plays in 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.930
 iberia express because I walk around 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.799
 free that this company 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.799
 it does not stay 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:46.340
 He also got up a little like that because he did not 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.750
 see the solution either, so you can see 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.049
 that you are asking me things and when 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.489
 you say solutions already because I did not like it 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.049
 good but surely you have the 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:57.859
 answer to this question from the guide 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:04:00.280
 abbey listens carefully to the background one 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:00.280
 little girl
