today<00:00:00.659> we<00:00:00.810> use<00:00:00.960> the<00:00:01.079> shop<00:00:01.290> odd<00:00:01.500> to<00:00:01.680> make<00:00:01.800> the

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
today we use the shop odd to make the

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.830 
today we use the shop odd to make the
final<00:00:02.280> pieces<00:00:02.460> of<00:00:02.639> our<00:00:02.820> full-size<00:00:03.240> dabble<00:00:03.659> box

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
final pieces of our full-size dabble box

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.200 
final pieces of our full-size dabble box
the<00:00:04.230> phases<00:00:04.650> the<00:00:05.609> first<00:00:05.819> thing<00:00:05.970> we're<00:00:06.089> going

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
the phases the first thing we're going

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.000 
the phases the first thing we're going
to<00:00:06.299> do<00:00:06.480> is<00:00:06.779> use<00:00:06.930> a<00:00:06.960> straight<00:00:07.290> bit<00:00:07.500> to<00:00:07.680> cut<00:00:07.830> to

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
to do is use a straight bit to cut to

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.709 
to do is use a straight bit to cut to
registration<00:00:08.429> holes<00:00:08.790> into<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.210> small<00:00:09.450> board

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
registration holes into the small board

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.749 
registration holes into the small board
itself<00:00:10.070> that's<00:00:11.070> because<00:00:11.340> we're<00:00:11.490> going<00:00:11.670> to

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
itself that's because we're going to

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.220 
itself that's because we're going to
need<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:12.000> machine<00:00:12.300> both<00:00:12.599> sides<00:00:12.960> of<00:00:13.110> our

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
need to machine both sides of our

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.169 
need to machine both sides of our
workpiece<00:00:13.559> today<00:00:13.860> which<00:00:14.370> requires<00:00:14.700> us<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:14.969> do

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
workpiece today which requires us to do

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.180 
workpiece today which requires us to do
this<00:00:15.360> little<00:00:15.540> trick<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:16.500> obviously<00:00:16.949> we're

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
this little trick and obviously we're

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.560 
this little trick and obviously we're
very<00:00:17.220> careful<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.880> set<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.180> depth<00:00:18.359> of<00:00:18.480> these

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
very careful to set the depth of these

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.570 
very careful to set the depth of these
holes<00:00:18.810> correctly<00:00:19.320> so<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:19.980> we<00:00:20.160> don't<00:00:20.279> drill

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
holes correctly so that we don't drill

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.950 
holes correctly so that we don't drill
through<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.880> spoil<00:00:21.150> board<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.630> into<00:00:21.810> the

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
through the spoil board and into the

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.259 
through the spoil board and into the
aluminum<00:00:22.199> bed<00:00:22.529> of<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.740> machine<00:00:26.119> then<00:00:27.119> I'll

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
aluminum bed of the machine then I'll

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.660 
aluminum bed of the machine then I'll
mount<00:00:27.449> my<00:00:27.660> workpiece<00:00:28.160> if<00:00:29.160> you're<00:00:29.340> wondering

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
mount my workpiece if you're wondering

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.009 
mount my workpiece if you're wondering
why<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:29.789> don't<00:00:29.910> always<00:00:30.359> just<00:00:30.539> mount<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.869> piece

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
why I don't always just mount the piece

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.900 
why I don't always just mount the piece
with<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.349> bottom<00:00:31.679> left<00:00:31.859> corner<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.460> at<00:00:32.579> 0-0

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
with the bottom left corner of it at 0-0

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.360 
with the bottom left corner of it at 0-0
it's<00:00:33.899> because<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.260> want<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.530> find<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.920> fresh<00:00:35.100> part

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
it's because I want to find a fresh part

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.680 
it's because I want to find a fresh part
of<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.520> spoil<00:00:35.790> board<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.210> doesn't<00:00:36.450> have<00:00:36.570> too

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
of the spoil board that doesn't have too

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.330 
of the spoil board that doesn't have too
many<00:00:36.750> mounting<00:00:37.230> holes<00:00:37.380> in<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.680> so<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.160> the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
many mounting holes in it so that the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.040 
many mounting holes in it so that the
screws<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.760> something<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.090> bite<00:00:39.210> into<00:00:42.050> our

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
screws of something to bite into our

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.540 
screws of something to bite into our
Apple<00:00:43.379> box<00:00:43.559> face<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:43.920> going<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.190> have<00:00:44.309> to

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
Apple box face is going to have to

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.220 
Apple box face is going to have to
handle<00:00:44.879> holes<00:00:45.090> there<00:00:45.719> are<00:00:45.750> two<00:00:45.960> different

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
handle holes there are two different

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.750 
handle holes there are two different
methods<00:00:46.500> we<00:00:46.590> can<00:00:46.620> use<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.010> cut<00:00:47.190> them<00:00:47.340> out<00:00:47.430> and

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
methods we can use to cut them out and

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.240 
methods we can use to cut them out and
we'll<00:00:48.030> show<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.239> both<00:00:48.739> the<00:00:49.739> first<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.219> make

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
we'll show you both the first is to make

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.430 
we'll show you both the first is to make
a<00:00:50.399> profile<00:00:50.969> tool<00:00:51.210> path<00:00:51.480> as<00:00:51.719> we<00:00:52.110> did<00:00:52.260> in<00:00:52.379> the

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
a profile tool path as we did in the

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.200 
a profile tool path as we did in the
previous<00:00:52.559> two<00:00:52.949> videos<00:00:55.370> this<00:00:56.370> time<00:00:56.430> we<00:00:56.760> specify

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
previous two videos this time we specify

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.700 
previous two videos this time we specify
that<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.480> machine<00:00:57.750> cut<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.230> inside<00:00:58.680> of

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
that the machine cut to the inside of

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.650 
that the machine cut to the inside of
the<00:00:58.890> line<00:00:59.070> rather<00:00:59.399> than<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.730> outside<00:01:00.059> because

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
the line rather than the outside because

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.849 
the line rather than the outside because
that's<00:01:00.809> what<00:01:00.960> we've<00:01:01.079> drawn<00:01:01.350> here<00:01:01.680> the

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
that's what we've drawn here the

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.369 
that's what we've drawn here the
negative<00:01:02.070> space<00:01:02.460> at<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.670> handle<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.260> we<00:01:04.260> add

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
negative space at the handle and we add

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.990 
negative space at the handle and we add
tabs<00:01:04.710> around<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.100> edge<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.430> cut<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:05.970> that

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
tabs around the edge of the cut so that

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.429 
tabs around the edge of the cut so that
we<00:01:06.180> don't<00:01:06.390> have<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.540> free-floating<00:01:06.960> piece<00:01:07.260> in

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
we don't have a free-floating piece in

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.469 
we don't have a free-floating piece in
the<00:01:07.500> middle<00:01:07.619> which<00:01:08.189> might<00:01:08.430> jam<00:01:08.670> up<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.850> bit<00:01:09.150> or

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
the middle which might jam up the bit or

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.320 
the middle which might jam up the bit or
get<00:01:09.689> thrown<00:01:09.869> around<00:01:10.850> and<00:01:11.850> you'll<00:01:12.000> notice<00:01:12.180> that

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
get thrown around and you'll notice that

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.760 
get thrown around and you'll notice that
I<00:01:12.420> place<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.840> tabs<00:01:13.049> along<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.380> straight

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
I place the tabs along the straight

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.280 
I place the tabs along the straight
edges<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.430> not<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.729> curves<00:01:14.939> this<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:16.020> because

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
edges and not the curves this is because

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.690 
edges and not the curves this is because
when<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.470> comes<00:01:16.710> time<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.950> remove<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.460> tabs

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
when it comes time to remove the tabs

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.550 
when it comes time to remove the tabs
it's<00:01:18.150> always<00:01:18.420> easier<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.750> file<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.229> sand<00:01:19.439> a

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
it's always easier to file and sand a

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.249 
it's always easier to file and sand a
flat<00:01:19.770> surface<00:01:20.040> than<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.700> curved<00:01:21.060> one

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
flat surface than it is a curved one

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.719 
flat surface than it is a curved one
however<00:01:22.259> by<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.619> end<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.860> this<00:01:23.009> video<00:01:23.250> you'll

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
however by the end of this video you'll

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.160 
however by the end of this video you'll
see<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:24.030> in<00:01:24.180> this<00:01:24.270> particular<00:01:24.479> case<00:01:24.960> it

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
see that in this particular case it

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.730 
see that in this particular case it
doesn't<00:01:25.320> matter

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
doesn't matter

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.109 
doesn't matter
because<00:01:26.100> we're<00:01:26.250> going<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.549> remove<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.909> tabs

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
because we're going to remove the tabs

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.859 
because we're going to remove the tabs
by<00:01:27.390> another<00:01:27.630> means<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.070> just<00:01:29.189> habit

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
by another means so this is just habit

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.310 
by another means so this is just habit

I<00:02:10.350> cut<00:02:10.530> into<00:02:10.740> the<00:02:10.830> spoil<00:02:11.100> board<00:02:12.110> now<00:02:13.110> we<00:02:13.170> select

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
I cut into the spoil board now we select

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.900 
I cut into the spoil board now we select
all<00:02:13.770> four<00:02:14.010> of<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.190> tool<00:02:14.340> paths<00:02:14.550> we<00:02:14.730> just

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
all four of the tool paths we just

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.730 
all four of the tool paths we just
created<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.750> software<00:02:16.110> combines<00:02:16.350> them

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
created and the software combines them

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.530 
created and the software combines them
into<00:02:16.950> a<00:02:16.980> single<00:02:17.280> cutting<00:02:17.730> file<00:02:17.910> that<00:02:18.210> we<00:02:18.360> send

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
into a single cutting file that we send

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:30.460 
into a single cutting file that we send
in<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.690> machine

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.620 

so<00:02:31.470> here's<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.340> handle<00:02:32.640> cut<00:02:32.819> by<00:02:32.970> a<00:02:33.000> profile

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
so here's the handle cut by a profile

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.839 
so here's the handle cut by a profile
and<00:02:33.900> here's<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.349> handle<00:02:34.590> cut<00:02:34.770> by<00:02:34.980> a<00:02:35.010> pocket<00:02:35.580> as

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
and here's the handle cut by a pocket as

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.120 
and here's the handle cut by a pocket as
you<00:02:36.330> can<00:02:36.569> see<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.989> pocket<00:02:37.440> toolpath<00:02:37.800> is<00:02:37.980> what

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
you can see a pocket toolpath is what

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.800 
you can see a pocket toolpath is what
you<00:02:38.220> use<00:02:38.430> if<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:38.670> were<00:02:38.819> cutting<00:02:39.030> a<00:02:39.150> mortise<00:02:39.510> or

the<00:02:48.000> handle<00:02:48.120> holes<00:02:48.450> over<00:02:48.660> so<00:02:49.170> we'll<00:02:49.260> switch<00:02:49.470> to

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
the handle holes over so we'll switch to

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:56.660 
the handle holes over so we'll switch to
the<00:02:49.709> point<00:02:49.920> over<00:02:50.310> bid<00:02:54.739> and<00:02:55.739> do<00:02:55.950> a<00:02:55.980> profile<00:02:56.430> tool

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:37.789 
precise as the shop butt is and my round
overs<00:03:36.540> wouldn't<00:03:36.810> line<00:03:36.930> up<00:03:36.959> precisely<00:03:37.260> with

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
overs wouldn't line up precisely with

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.680 
overs wouldn't line up precisely with
the<00:03:37.829> existing<00:03:38.310> handle<00:03:38.640> holes<00:03:38.790> it<00:03:39.420> might<00:03:39.599> be

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
the existing handle holes it might be

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.660 
the existing handle holes it might be
off<00:03:39.840> by<00:03:40.049> a<00:03:40.079> millimeter<00:03:40.379> or<00:03:40.680> so<00:03:40.829> that's<00:03:41.519> why

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
off by a millimeter or so that's why

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
off by a millimeter or so that's why
we've<00:03:41.849> cut<00:03:42.060> these<00:03:42.180> registration<00:03:42.870> holes

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
we've cut these registration holes

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.759 
we've cut these registration holes
I'll<00:03:45.690> stick<00:03:46.049> two<00:03:46.200> dowels<00:03:46.409> into<00:03:46.769> them<00:03:47.329> and<00:03:48.769> use

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
I'll stick two dowels into them and use

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.559 
I'll stick two dowels into them and use
these<00:03:49.950> to<00:03:50.250> position<00:03:50.670> the<00:03:50.760> workpiece<00:03:51.090> on<00:03:51.299> as<00:03:51.480> I

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
these to position the workpiece on as I

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:59.449 
these to position the workpiece on as I
flip<00:03:51.780> it<00:03:51.900> over<00:03:57.889> then<00:03:58.889> I'll<00:03:59.010> screw<00:03:59.220> the<00:03:59.340> word

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
flip it over then I'll screw the word

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.830 
flip it over then I'll screw the word
piece<00:03:59.700> back<00:03:59.909> down<00:04:02.209> over<00:04:03.209> on<00:04:03.480> the<00:04:03.569> drawing

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
piece back down over on the drawing

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.720 
piece back down over on the drawing
here's<00:04:04.440> the<00:04:04.560> layer<00:04:04.709> I<00:04:04.739> use<00:04:05.129> to<00:04:05.340> drill<00:04:05.549> the

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
here's the layer I use to drill the

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.830 
here's the layer I use to drill the
registration<00:04:06.239> holes<00:04:06.420> into<00:04:06.659> the<00:04:06.810> small<00:04:07.049> board

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
registration holes into the small board

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.119 
registration holes into the small board
I'll<00:04:09.840> take<00:04:10.049> the<00:04:10.200> outline<00:04:10.500> of<00:04:10.620> the<00:04:10.709> Apple<00:04:11.010> box

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129 
I'll take the outline of the Apple box

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:13.309 
I'll take the outline of the Apple box
face<00:04:11.519> and<00:04:11.940> drag<00:04:12.299> it<00:04:12.480> over<00:04:12.599> so<00:04:13.079> that<00:04:13.109> the

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
face and drag it over so that the

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.629 
face and drag it over so that the
registration<00:04:13.680> holes<00:04:14.099> match<00:04:16.130> now<00:04:17.130> when<00:04:17.370> I<00:04:17.400> tell

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
registration holes match now when I tell

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:22.430 
registration holes match now when I tell
the<00:04:17.729> machine<00:04:17.970> to<00:04:18.090> cut<00:04:18.239> the<00:04:18.359> round<00:04:18.479> overs<00:04:18.900> I<00:04:21.440> get

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
the machine to cut the round overs I get

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.890 
the machine to cut the round overs I get
perfect<00:04:22.830> results<00:04:22.860> and<00:04:23.599> rounding<00:04:24.599> over<00:04:24.660> on

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
perfect results and rounding over on

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.689 
perfect results and rounding over on
