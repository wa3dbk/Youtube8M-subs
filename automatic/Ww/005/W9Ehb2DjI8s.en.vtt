unbelievable<00:04:14.230> so<00:04:15.230> Ram<00:04:15.440> box<00:04:15.709> really<00:04:16.010> is<00:04:16.100> a

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
unbelievable so Ram box really is a

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.610 
unbelievable so Ram box really is a
complete<00:04:16.340> storage<00:04:16.970> system<00:04:17.359> we've<00:04:18.079> got<00:04:18.320> four

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
complete storage system we've got four

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.199 
complete storage system we've got four
components<00:04:19.220> the<00:04:19.489> first<00:04:19.730> one<00:04:19.910> I'll<00:04:20.000> talk<00:04:20.180> about

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
components the first one I'll talk about

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.250 
components the first one I'll talk about
is<00:04:20.720> the<00:04:21.109> bed<00:04:21.680> divider<00:04:22.090> this<00:04:23.090> can<00:04:23.270> be<00:04:23.300> put<00:04:23.600> in<00:04:23.780> 11

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
is the bed divider this can be put in 11

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.900 
is the bed divider this can be put in 11
different<00:04:24.410> positions<00:04:25.160> and<00:04:25.340> the<00:04:25.700> big

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
different positions and the big

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.610 
different positions and the big
advantage<00:04:26.300> of<00:04:26.390> this<00:04:26.540> it<00:04:26.720> keeps<00:04:26.930> your<00:04:27.140> stuff<00:04:27.410> at

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
advantage of this it keeps your stuff at

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.290 
advantage of this it keeps your stuff at
the<00:04:27.710> back<00:04:27.919> of<00:04:28.100> the<00:04:28.190> truck<00:04:28.460> we've<00:04:29.090> also

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
the back of the truck we've also

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.110 
the back of the truck we've also
maintained<00:04:30.050> 49<00:04:31.040> inches<00:04:31.400> between<00:04:31.640> the<00:04:31.910> Box

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
maintained 49 inches between the Box

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.090 
maintained 49 inches between the Box
side<00:04:32.419> so<00:04:32.690> you<00:04:32.720> can<00:04:32.840> still<00:04:33.200> transport<00:04:33.800> four

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
side so you can still transport four

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.430 
side so you can still transport four
foot<00:04:34.310> building<00:04:34.669> materials<00:04:35.270> so<00:04:36.139> the<00:04:36.260> bed

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
foot building materials so the bed

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.680 
foot building materials so the bed
divider<00:04:36.860> also<00:04:37.370> flips<00:04:37.639> around<00:04:37.760> and<00:04:38.090> becomes<00:04:38.540> a

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
divider also flips around and becomes a

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.370 
divider also flips around and becomes a
convenient<00:04:39.169> bed<00:04:39.350> extender

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.560 

when<00:04:43.130> it<00:04:43.220> comes<00:04:43.430> to<00:04:43.640> getting<00:04:43.850> your<00:04:44.060> gear<00:04:44.360> where

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
when it comes to getting your gear where
