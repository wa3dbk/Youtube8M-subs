00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:06.430
 the huayno the huayno is a rhythm 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:09.639
 originating in the part of the Sierra del 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:12.070
 Peru, whose influence extends to 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:15.459
 nearby countries of ecuador north of 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:19.390
 Argentina also northern Chile and 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:21.490
 also other places in South America that 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.370
 they have the mountain range of the Andes as 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:28.750
 common denominator is a very rhythm 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:30.789
 festive very cheerful and that has a great 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.610
 influence on the rest of the music 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.320
 of the Andes' because their 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.960
 influence comes from the time 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.440
 Pre - Columbian with the advent of 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:44.320
 new instruments has increased the 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.140
 possibility of touching one more way 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.880
 orchestral and more complete but has not 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.399
 lost what he has always had that is 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.670
 his great joy is danced with much 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:58.210
 fun and all kinds of parties 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:02.320
 we have chosen a huayno for the example 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:04.269
 called the pious peep uses very few 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.460
 elements in the left hand this 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.890
 it means that it has a very harmonious 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.680
 simple to the way how was the harmony 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.470
 in pre- Columbian times 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:18.340
 in which they used the pentatonic harmony 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:21.970
 this means with five notes nothing 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.220
 more there were no semitones then 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.160
 we will see how ripping 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.680
 huayno using the chords in this 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:33.630
 case of the greater sun 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:37.189
 and my minor nothing more 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.189
 the huayno sounds like this 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.340
 let's see it in detail 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.330
 very well 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:01.180
 one ruled up another one down 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.180
 another one up and one click 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:14.260
 let's practice using the two 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:16.569
 chords of this subject the own has 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:21.610
 four times in each of his 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:24.890
 bars 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 points 3 4 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:28.300
 points 3 4 points 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.300
 let's go to practice 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:44.270
 here we can give some element more than 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.300
 It can serve because it gives you a little more 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.840
 mischief to this cool what it is when 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.840
 finished 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.849
 in my minor the whole sequence that is 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.830
 just two chords to go back to 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:01.700
 start 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:05.709
 the rhythmic cycle we give three blows 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.709
 in this way and it would sound like this 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.360
 helped this time by an instrument that 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.580
 make the melodic line let's listen to a 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.690
 fragment of this cool not so happy 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.690
 called the peep tweet 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.870
 Y
