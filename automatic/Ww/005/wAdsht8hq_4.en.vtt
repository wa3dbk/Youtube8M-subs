 quarter of misano but if they are rooms of 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.170
 No truth but you know why not 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.080
 I want you to disarm me in remembering 

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:20.000

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.060
 apple rome because he told me a little bit that

 it's the best to see the green we 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.330
 interesting 'green use green do not stop 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.490
 cooking because you are missing an ingredient 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.740
 but the romeva know that it has a flavor 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.570
 very particular cooking is better 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.160
 and it's not mashed because we use apple 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.320
 red first because it's very sweet and 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.700
 second because pureed not banking 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.920
 the cooking does not heat the heat 

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.360
 red to eat this in 15 minutes is 

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.170

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.170
