00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.680
 Since the previous nugget about how animal testing kills people, I have received several requests 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.450
 about which good alternatives there are. By the way, now that Ooby is back you will like this 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.039
 hear in the background. * snoring sounds *. Animal testing is not only dangerous 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.990
 for people, do not achieve scientific results, but 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.970
 it is also not the only option. Provide money during a government consultation 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.390
 for research, former Health Director of US National Institute for Health, Dr. Elias Zerhoni, admitted 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.160
 that experimenting on animals to help people has been a big mistake. He said his colleagues 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.340
 "We have moved away from studying human disease in humans. We all have it 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.590
 cooperated. Me too. The problem is that animal testing has not worked and it is 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.039
 time we quit. We must again focus on new methods and adjust them 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:57.100
 for use in humans to understand diseases in humans. "Simply put, by doctors 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.179
 MacLennan and Amos "There is no doubt that the best type of test for humans is humans." 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:06.380
 So what are the alternatives? I get a lot of my information from the John Hopkins 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.890
 University Center. We don't have time 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.950
 treat all alternatives but here are the most important. There are 3 categories. 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.200
 First, there are advanced tests that use human cells and tissue. This is called 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.360
 in vitro methods, then there are advanced computer model techniques, 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.110
 the in silico methods, and thirdly there are studies with human volunteers. This and others 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.700
 non-animal tests do not suffer from the differences between species that cause animal testing 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.399
 make results impossible with people. And, usually it takes less time and money. 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:41.100
 Here are some examples of in vitro testing. Harvard University's Wyss 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.579
 Institute of biological inspired engineering has made organs on chips that contain human cells 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:49.500
 in a state-of-the-art system to imitate the structure and functions of human organs. 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.350
 The chips can be used instead of animals and have shown that 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.340
 replicating human physiology, diseases and medicines this is much more precise than the 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.890
 coarse animal testing. 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.570
 Arteries on a chip have been used to study heart disease and have Canadian scientists 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.590
 microfluidic chips developed to study fragile blood vessels in an easy and inexpensive way. 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.750
 The device can test thousands of new drugs on them 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.700
 effect on blood vessels and veins. Harvard's Wyss Institute has made a breathable lung on 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.150
 a microchip in 2010. Wyss researchers later received a sum of money to develop a spleen 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.290
 on a chip to treat blood poisoning. Now they have a physiological realistic gut on a chip 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.040
 made with which they can study much more complex interactions than with the previous (animal) models. 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.590
 They are currently working on more than 10 different organs with the ultimate goal of 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.390
 link them all together with fluid channels to create a more representative model for drug testing 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.390
 to make. 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.180
 Ceetox made a method to determine the potency of a substance 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.209
 a skin allergy in humans gives what Mat Tek's model uses, a three-dimensional 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.690
 human cell derived from a skin model that resembles normal human skin. 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.080
 Researchers from the European Union Reference Library for the Alternatives to Animal Testing 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.560
 designed five different tests that human blood cells use to infect medication 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.019
 potentially dangerous to discover. The non-animal 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.799
 methods replace the cruel use of rabbits in these painful tests. Now some examples 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.049
 of in silico models. Researchers have a good number of advanced computer models 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.360
 developed to simulate human biology and the development of diseases. 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.510
 Research shows that these models accurately predict how that new drug will respond in one 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.269
 human body, now some examples of human volunteers. A method called micro dosing can 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.379
 provide vital information for the safety of an experimental drug. Volunteers receive a one-off 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:34.189
 an extremely small amount and advanced imaging techniques are used to monitor how 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:38.470
 the drug behaves in the body. Advanced brain imaging techniques such as 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.000
 Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging can be used to replace outdated experiments 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.060
 rats, cats and monkeys damaging the brain. These modern techniques allow it 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.299
 to study people safely up to neuron level, such as 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:56.129
 at Intracranial Electroencephalography. Simulators are another alternative. 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:00.970
 These computers are very similar to people and breathing, bleeding, convulsing, talking 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.750
 and even die. They have shown that they let students learn better 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.920
 then cruel exercises where animals are cut open. The most advanced simulators 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.840
 imitate injuries and illnesses and give the right responses to treatment 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.430
 with injections or medication and the students teach better than 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.480
 education in which live pigs, goats or dogs are dissected. So, 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.400
 as you can see there are plenty of good alternatives to animal testing. It is 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.610
 all a terrible idea regardless of whether there are alternatives, but given that 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.670
 there are alternatives that are cheaper, not cruel and more efficient, then there is no g * dv * rd * mme 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:42.630
 reason to continue to do animal testing. Please visit Bite Size Vegan and sign up for
