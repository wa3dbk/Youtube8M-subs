00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
little purses so she is the big coach

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.760 
little purses so she is the big coach
purses<00:01:43.470> or<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.950> big<00:01:45.079> louie<00:01:46.079> vuitton<00:01:46.200> purses

or<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.340> know<00:01:47.460> stuff<00:01:47.700> like<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.540> just

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
or you know stuff like that this is just

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.960 
or you know stuff like that this is just
another<00:01:48.899> coach<00:01:49.229> one<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.680> this<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.040> gold<00:01:50.340> so

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
another coach one and this is in gold so

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.300 
another coach one and this is in gold so
it's<00:01:51.270> brown<00:01:51.570> with<00:01:51.899> gold<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.500> handles<00:01:52.920> gold

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
and the bottom has gold trimming I think

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.190 
and the bottom has gold trimming I think
this<00:01:56.670> one<00:01:56.880> actually<00:01:57.060> wasn't<00:01:57.420> from<00:01:57.659> an<00:01:57.780> outlet

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200

this is from the regular coach store so

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.200 
this is from the regular coach store so
you<00:02:01.890> probably<00:02:02.070> can't<00:02:02.340> find<00:02:02.520> us<00:02:02.610> on<00:02:02.759> an<00:02:02.850> outlet
