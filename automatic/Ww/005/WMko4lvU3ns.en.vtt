00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.620
 in the next film we show 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.960
 how to adjust optimally 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.580
 shock absorber and suspension fork 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.099
 of our new tops models 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.230
 after three and a proxy this a first 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.970
 place push back the O-rings on 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.310
 the suspension fork joint is 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.470
 back this one up to the stop of 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.230
 the shock absorber sit carefully 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.330
 on the bike if you are doing it alone 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.820
 procedure for adjusting the travel of 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.760
 the suspension it is better to you 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.040
 place laterally against wall or can 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.070
 comfortably support you next 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.350
 go down carefully from the bike check 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.170
 then the fork and 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.750
 the damper the clearance obtained is 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.760
 called and wise and so that the good 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.620
 value is wise and settle according to the 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.149
 type of your mountain bike 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.420
 you must first know 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:02.780
 exactly which suspension element 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.300
 your bike is equipped change the value 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.640
 is wise and leads to a more 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.920
 flexible or harder what you get 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.569
 by adding or removing air with 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.569
 the suspension fork pump 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:23.160
 after checking the travel again 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.000
 of suspensions by following the same 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.870
 procedure 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.630
 go up check the value is wise and 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:32.430
 inflate or deflate back up 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.620
 what value is wise and be fair 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.110
 for the model at the proc 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.340
 we advise a value is wise and 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.160
 25% 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.860
 we advise to note the pressure 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.590
 of air so as not to have to establish 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.830
 optimum value each time here is a 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.780
 again briefly the procedure pushed 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.730
 the o-ring to the joints of the 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.430
 fork then 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.710
 sit down without putting any weight on the 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.680
 handlebar since measure the value is wise 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.340
 and emit or remove the following air 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.580
 the need 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.830
 finally inquire and start over again 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.910
 procedure until the value is 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:14.010
 wise and reach 25% you can 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.010
 adapt the answer to fouras suspension 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.990
 that is, to relax 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.110
 according to your desires with the red button 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.840
 rebug ensure that relaxation forms 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:29.070
 a neck or vibration compression 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.650
 on the mound and our advice do you notice 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.720
 values ​​for example four geeks the 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.950
 minimum 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.720
 you can adjust the relax the 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.300
 fork with the black button on the 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.920
 local controller and glen the level of 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.610
 pressure as low as possible 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.160
 in the beginning and then do a trial run and 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.350
 then change the pressure level 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.110
 so there is no pressure loss 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.570
 during braking or shock during a 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.489
 jump with the controller lock out 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.349
 you can or even blocked the fork 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.790
 on three different levels 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:04.730
 the setting of the trigger of 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.659
 the damper is identical to the fork 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:11.239
 suspended so the damper can 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:12.980
 be blocked or loosen with the monocle 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.200
 dampers is not completely 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.900
 blocked but it actually compresses 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.810
 the swing settings perfect for 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.639
 for example an asphalt rating and the mode 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.459
 pedal is especially suited to the terrain 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:27.650
 then flat open mode with which 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:31.329
 we are doing remarkably well with 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.329
 quick and consecutive shots
