Earth's<00:00:13.330> North<00:00:13.690> Pole<00:00:14.490> tides<00:00:15.490> are<00:00:15.700> caused

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:15.880 
Earth's North Pole tides are caused

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.760 
Earth's North Pole tides are caused
mainly<00:00:16.150> by<00:00:16.450> the<00:00:16.480> gravitational<00:00:17.320> pull<00:00:17.529> of<00:00:17.560> the

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:17.770 
mainly by the gravitational pull of the

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.370 
mainly by the gravitational pull of the
moon<00:00:17.980> it<00:00:18.849> causes<00:00:19.360> the<00:00:19.480> water<00:00:19.689> on<00:00:19.900> the<00:00:20.020> planet

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:20.380 
moon it causes the water on the planet

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.859 
moon it causes the water on the planet
to<00:00:20.500> bulge<00:00:20.740> towards<00:00:21.340> it<00:00:21.489> it's<00:00:22.180> exaggerated

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
to bulge towards it it's exaggerated

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.620 
to bulge towards it it's exaggerated
here<00:00:23.169> but<00:00:23.349> you<00:00:23.439> get<00:00:23.619> the<00:00:23.739> idea<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:25.180> water<00:00:25.419> is

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.630 
here but you get the idea the water is

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.650 
here but you get the idea the water is
pulled<00:00:25.900> towards<00:00:26.349> the<00:00:26.410> moon<00:00:26.650> at<00:00:27.340> this<00:00:28.329> point

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
pulled towards the moon at this point

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.290 
pulled towards the moon at this point
it's<00:00:28.899> high<00:00:29.169> water<00:00:29.470> at<00:00:30.160> this<00:00:30.579> other<00:00:30.759> point<00:00:31.060> it's

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
it's high water at this other point it's

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.540 
it's high water at this other point it's
low<00:00:31.540> water

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
low water

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.060 
low water
however<00:00:33.550> the<00:00:34.000> Earth<00:00:34.120> rotates<00:00:34.649> so<00:00:35.649> the<00:00:35.800> level

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
however the Earth rotates so the level

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.890 
however the Earth rotates so the level
of<00:00:36.160> the<00:00:36.250> tide<00:00:36.460> at<00:00:36.610> these<00:00:36.760> two<00:00:36.970> points<00:00:37.210> changes

at<00:00:38.710> one<00:00:38.980> point<00:00:39.220> it<00:00:39.430> falls<00:00:39.730> while<00:00:40.420> it<00:00:40.570> rises<00:00:40.990> at

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
at one point it falls while it rises at

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.610 
at one point it falls while it rises at
the<00:00:41.260> other<00:00:42.240> roughly<00:00:43.240> six<00:00:43.480> hours<00:00:43.690> later<00:00:43.990> the

with two high waters every day is the

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.800 
with two high waters every day is the

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:55.810 
most common on the planet and is called

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.050 
most common on the planet and is called
semi<00:00:56.200> diamond<00:00:56.710> this<00:00:57.460> is<00:00:57.610> how<00:00:57.760> it<00:00:57.880> looks

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.060 
semi diamond this is how it looks

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.700 
semi diamond this is how it looks
graphically<00:00:58.660> but<00:00:58.990> it<00:00:59.079> does<00:00:59.290> not<00:00:59.470> apply

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
graphically but it does not apply

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.860 
graphically but it does not apply
everywhere<00:01:00.370> because<00:01:01.120> the<00:01:01.420> earth<00:01:01.510> is<00:01:01.750> not

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
everywhere because the earth is not

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.900 
everywhere because the earth is not
evenly<00:01:02.350> covered<00:01:02.680> with<00:01:02.829> water<00:01:03.070> some<00:01:03.640> places

evenly covered with water some places

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.999 
evenly covered with water some places
have<00:01:04.239> just<00:01:04.479> one<00:01:04.659> high<00:01:04.869> water<00:01:05.110> a<00:01:05.259> day<00:01:05.320> while

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009 
have just one high water a day while

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:08.730 
have just one high water a day while
others<00:01:06.369> experience<00:01:06.939> very<00:01:07.210> mixed<00:01:07.659> tides<00:01:07.930> so

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
others experience very mixed tides so

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.050 
others experience very mixed tides so
whenever<00:01:08.979> you<00:01:09.159> paddle<00:01:09.490> anywhere<00:01:09.880> that's

whenever you paddle anywhere that's

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.999 
whenever you paddle anywhere that's
affected<00:01:10.539> by<00:01:10.569> tide<00:01:10.960> and<00:01:11.259> that's<00:01:11.439> most<00:01:11.710> of<00:01:11.920> the

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 
affected by tide and that's most of the

this you can see the pattern that we

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.239 
this you can see the pattern that we
talked<00:01:30.909> about<00:01:30.999> earlier<00:01:31.679> or<00:01:32.679> you<00:01:32.920> can<00:01:33.069> have

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:33.249 
talked about earlier or you can have

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:35.279 
talked about earlier or you can have
tides<00:01:33.549> from<00:01:33.819> a<00:01:33.880> smartphone<00:01:34.270> app<00:01:34.689> which<00:01:35.109> is

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289 
tides from a smartphone app which is

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:36.870 
tides from a smartphone app which is
quite<00:01:35.499> handy<00:01:35.679> because<00:01:36.009> you<00:01:36.189> usually<00:01:36.520> have

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
quite handy because you usually have

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.419 
quite handy because you usually have
your<00:01:36.909> phone<00:01:37.240> on<00:01:37.479> you<00:01:37.539> however<00:01:38.229> you<00:01:38.740> could<00:01:39.280> have

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429 
your phone on you however you could have

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:40.919 
your phone on you however you could have
problems<00:01:39.789> with<00:01:39.880> batteries<00:01:40.420> or<00:01:40.600> with<00:01:40.719> water

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 
problems with batteries or with water

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:42.899 
problems with batteries or with water
and<00:01:41.319> therefore<00:01:42.100> I<00:01:42.130> would<00:01:42.219> always<00:01:42.549> carry

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
and therefore I would always carry

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.440 
and therefore I would always carry
printed<00:01:43.420> information<00:01:43.539> as<00:01:44.079> well<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:46.240> key

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
printed information as well the key

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.330 
printed information as well the key
things<00:01:46.719> we<00:01:46.780> need<00:01:47.079> are<00:01:47.259> the<00:01:47.380> times<00:01:47.770> of<00:01:48.009> high<00:01:48.189> and

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
things we need are the times of high and

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.760 
things we need are the times of high and
low<00:01:48.429> water<00:01:48.700> and<00:01:49.090> the<00:01:49.450> tidal<00:01:49.719> range<00:01:49.929> which<00:01:50.590> is

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
low water and the tidal range which is

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.550 
low water and the tidal range which is
very<00:01:50.979> important<00:01:51.520> so<00:01:51.700> I<00:01:51.729> better<00:01:52.029> explain<00:01:52.209> them

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.920 

when<00:01:56.560> the<00:01:56.680> Sun<00:01:56.920> Moon<00:01:57.460> and<00:01:57.490> Earth<00:01:57.820> line<00:01:58.150> up<00:01:58.360> the

gravitational pull on the Earth's oceans

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.390 
gravitational pull on the Earth's oceans
is<00:02:01.120> greatest<00:02:01.659> it<00:02:02.530> doesn't<00:02:02.950> matter<00:02:03.130> whether

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
is greatest it doesn't matter whether

is<00:04:03.720> at<00:04:03.930> its<00:04:04.080> minimum<00:04:04.260> on<00:04:04.680> a<00:04:04.739> neap<00:04:05.010> tide<00:04:05.720> minimum

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
is at its minimum on a neap tide minimum

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.590 
is at its minimum on a neap tide minimum
volume<00:04:06.959> minimum<00:04:07.950> speed<00:04:10.940> so<00:04:11.940> that's<00:04:12.090> tidal

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
volume minimum speed so that's tidal

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.509 
volume minimum speed so that's tidal
range<00:04:12.840> so<00:04:13.410> far<00:04:13.620> we've<00:04:13.769> talked<00:04:14.010> about<00:04:14.130> how<00:04:14.459> the

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
range so far we've talked about how the

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.520 
range so far we've talked about how the
tide<00:04:14.850> goes<00:04:15.090> up<00:04:15.300> and<00:04:15.480> down<00:04:15.570> and<00:04:15.989> that<00:04:16.260> can<00:04:16.440> be

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
tide goes up and down and that can be

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.140 
tide goes up and down and that can be
very<00:04:16.769> important<00:04:17.370> when<00:04:17.549> you've<00:04:17.700> got<00:04:17.850> a<00:04:17.880> long

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
very important when you've got a long

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.319 
very important when you've got a long
walk<00:04:18.390> out<00:04:18.660> on<00:04:18.840> a<00:04:18.870> flat<00:04:19.109> Beach<00:04:19.489> however<00:04:20.489> most<00:04:21.209> of

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
walk out on a flat Beach however most of

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.240 
walk out on a flat Beach however most of
the<00:04:21.419> time<00:04:21.660> as<00:04:21.840> kayakers<00:04:22.260> what<00:04:22.440> we<00:04:22.620> really<00:04:23.070> need

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
the time as kayakers what we really need

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.490 
the time as kayakers what we really need
to<00:04:23.370> know<00:04:23.400> about<00:04:23.610> is<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.270> horizontal<00:04:24.660> flow<00:04:25.320> of

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
to know about is the horizontal flow of

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.460 
to know about is the horizontal flow of
water<00:04:25.740> tidal<00:04:26.610> streams<00:04:26.970> I'll<00:04:27.840> come<00:04:28.140> back<00:04:28.260> to

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
water tidal streams I'll come back to

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.710 
water tidal streams I'll come back to
that<00:04:28.500> later<00:04:28.910> meanwhile<00:04:29.910> let's<00:04:30.180> go<00:04:30.330> back<00:04:30.540> to

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
that later meanwhile let's go back to

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.420 
that later meanwhile let's go back to
Gordon<00:04:31.140> and<00:04:31.320> do<00:04:31.710> some<00:04:31.890> more<00:04:32.040> practical
