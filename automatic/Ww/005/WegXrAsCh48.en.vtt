00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.570
 android insider hi friends 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.490
 Recently, our channel has already been reviewed on 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.920
 application created to 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.050
 simplify the task of sending sms and make 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.060
 its cheaper this time 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.560
 time for calls and again for help to 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.029
 we get a useful program with 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.039
 using which you can call and 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.470
 send a message to the phone and any 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.420
 operators in any country bim application 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.430
 in our opinion even better than skype and the fact 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.650
 there are reasons 1 on your screen 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.900
 buddy will display your number 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.510
 as when you call and the second arrival 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.300
 The reason is full synchronization of contacts with 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.790
 m s and the third calls are clearly cheaper and no 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.600
 no commission visually bim looks 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.160
 pretty fresh 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.200
 a gradient of colors from purple to 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.830
 turquoise greets us set screen 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.750
 numbers 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.090
 it immediately suggests that these are quite 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.980
 You can replace the standard dialer if 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.810
 the service you like right there for us 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.240
 shows our balance is present below 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.739
 the usual buttons to us first shows 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.140
 favorites list with the option 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.090
 add directly to this menu author and 2 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.009
 the following is already quite interesting 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.990
 moment since the application has full 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.009
 integration with your history contacts 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.229
 calls and sms 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.060
 All previously listed will be available in 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.039
 these tabs to check how it is 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.689
 working you can make a test call 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:23.969
 he is already in your contact 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.950
 open the menu curtain which is called 

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:28.049
 the button on the top left would be cool 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.569
 Of course, activate it with a swipe at first 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.819
 I thought and after a while I discovered that 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:35.700
 for opening with wipe you need to attach 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:37.770
 small efforts the first thing we see is our 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.020
 number and again the balance in the account 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.789
 menu item gives us a balance 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.539
 opportunity to throw about money through 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:44.850
 google play 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:47.069
 how many have thrown so much you will have without 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.509
 Commissions can then invite a friend. 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:50.340
 to use it too 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.259
 by applying such a case accordingly 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.899
 call and network itself to each other you will 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.759
 free next item all settings 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.189
 intuitively just give permission here 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.590
 application to open 3g networks for calls 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.840
 we put only free messages to 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.270
 money saving and payment notifications 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.810
 we sms in this column set the displayed 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.150
 your number goes first and that's what 2 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.160
 the world I do not quite understand further points about 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.260
 applications and help by the way second 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.330
 I advise you to postulate a lot of useful 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.370
 Information there will find and on this we 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.319
 smoothly close the topic of profitable communication 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.760
 once again I want to add that if 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.069
 This application will use 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.800
 enough people she's quite 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.110
 will compete with vibe and skype a little 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.830
 That at the first start to you 10 arrives 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.959
