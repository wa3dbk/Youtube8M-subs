is any where and I think that's really
fun<00:02:50.490> it<00:02:51.390> limits<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.020> the<00:02:52.830> camping<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.610> it

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000

hopefully<00:03:19.770> you<00:03:19.980> know<00:03:20.070> the<00:03:20.190> guns<00:03:20.400> will<00:03:20.550> be<00:03:20.640> a

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
hopefully you know the guns will be a

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.430 
hopefully you know the guns will be a
little<00:03:20.850> bit<00:03:21.030> more<00:03:21.180> balance<00:03:21.390> for<00:03:22.320> me

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
little bit more balance for me

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.260 
little bit more balance for me
personally<00:03:22.710> though<00:03:23.160> I<00:03:23.340> don't<00:03:23.460> mind<00:03:23.850> if<00:03:24.060> one

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
personally though I don't mind if one

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.510 
personally though I don't mind if one
gun<00:03:24.510> Trump's<00:03:25.380> all<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:25.800> it<00:03:25.890> seems<00:03:26.100> like<00:03:26.310> it's

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
gun Trump's all and it seems like it's

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.580 
gun Trump's all and it seems like it's
really<00:03:26.790> hard<00:03:27.060> to<00:03:27.300> make<00:03:27.450> a<00:03:27.480> game<00:03:27.780> where<00:03:28.380> that's

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
really hard to make a game where that's

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.970 
really hard to make a game where that's
not<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.950> case<00:03:29.360> even<00:03:30.360> in<00:03:30.450> mw2<00:03:30.900> you<00:03:31.230> had<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:31.440> UMP

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
not the case even in mw2 you had the UMP

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.090 
not the case even in mw2 you had the UMP
you<00:03:32.220> had<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.490> tar<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.820> ACR<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.720> famas<00:03:34.100> the

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
you had the tar the ACR the famas the

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.920 
you had the tar the ACR the famas the
scar<00:03:35.430> was<00:03:35.640> even<00:03:35.910> good<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.240> saw<00:03:36.450> a<00:03:36.480> lot<00:03:36.570> of<00:03:36.720> pro

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
scar was even good you saw a lot of pro

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.650 
scar was even good you saw a lot of pro
players<00:03:37.230> use<00:03:37.470> it<00:03:37.650> namely<00:03:38.060> liar<00:03:39.060> used<00:03:39.480> it

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
players use it namely liar used it

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.290 
players use it namely liar used it
actually<00:03:40.020> saw<00:03:40.230> him<00:03:40.500> use<00:03:40.710> it<00:03:40.740> quite<00:03:41.010> a<00:03:41.070> bit<00:03:41.300> and

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
actually saw him use it quite a bit and

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.460 
actually saw him use it quite a bit and
you<00:03:42.960> know<00:03:43.110> there<00:03:43.770> weren't<00:03:44.040> a<00:03:44.250> lot<00:03:44.280> of<00:03:44.520> guns

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
you know there weren't a lot of guns

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.810 
you know there weren't a lot of guns
that<00:03:46.470> were<00:03:46.620> being<00:03:46.800> used<00:03:46.890> and<00:03:47.310> I<00:03:47.370> think<00:03:47.610> that

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
that were being used and I think that

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.390 
that were being used and I think that
you<00:03:47.970> know<00:03:48.090> this<00:03:48.540> game<00:03:48.840> black<00:03:49.590> ops<00:03:49.800> got<00:03:50.160> a<00:03:50.190> bad

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
you know this game black ops got a bad

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.010 
you know this game black ops got a bad
rap<00:03:50.610> because<00:03:50.850> it<00:03:51.210> seems<00:03:51.420> to<00:03:51.540> be<00:03:51.600> only<00:03:51.840> the

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
rap because it seems to be only the

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.440 
rap because it seems to be only the
famas<00:03:52.440> I'm<00:03:52.980> although<00:03:53.430> even<00:03:53.730> now<00:03:54.090> you<00:03:54.150> don't

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
famas I'm although even now you don't

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.580 
famas I'm although even now you don't
have<00:03:54.480> to<00:03:54.600> the<00:03:54.750> patch<00:03:54.960> and<00:03:55.230> stuff<00:03:55.380> like<00:03:55.530> that

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
have to the patch and stuff like that

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.280 
have to the patch and stuff like that
seems<00:03:56.490> that<00:03:56.580> the<00:03:56.760> ogden<00:03:57.300> used<00:03:57.630> more<00:03:57.930> seems

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
seems that the ogden used more seems

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.550 
seems that the ogden used more seems
that<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.700> spectre<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.880> 74<00:04:00.450> you<00:04:00.660> more<00:04:01.290> guns

that the spectre the 74 you more guns

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
call it it's being used as well you know

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.960 
call it it's being used as well you know
even<00:04:07.590> at<00:04:07.830> you<00:04:07.950> know<00:04:08.040> pro<00:04:08.250> circuit<00:04:08.430> events<00:04:08.880> i

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
even at you know pro circuit events i

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.030 
even at you know pro circuit events i
saw<00:04:09.210> i<00:04:09.540> don't<00:04:09.990> know<00:04:10.050> exactly<00:04:10.410> who<00:04:10.590> it<00:04:10.680> was<00:04:10.830> but

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
saw i don't know exactly who it was but

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.490 
saw i don't know exactly who it was but
somebody<00:04:11.310> was<00:04:11.490> using<00:04:11.550> the<00:04:11.880> spaz<00:04:12.120> on<00:04:12.360> grid<00:04:12.960> SMD

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
somebody was using the spaz on grid SMD

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.830 
somebody was using the spaz on grid SMD
and<00:04:13.710> just<00:04:14.220> for<00:04:14.340> nuts<00:04:14.670> with<00:04:14.880> it<00:04:15.060> now<00:04:15.480> isn't<00:04:15.750> in

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
and just for nuts with it now isn't in

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.289 
and just for nuts with it now isn't in
every<00:04:16.200> map<00:04:16.410> gun<00:04:16.650> obviously<00:04:17.220> not<00:04:17.400> but<00:04:17.609> it's<00:04:18.180> a

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
every map gun obviously not but it's a

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.240 
every map gun obviously not but it's a
really<00:04:18.480> good<00:04:18.540> gun<00:04:18.810> and<00:04:18.989> i<00:04:19.049> think<00:04:19.290> that<00:04:19.530> even<00:04:19.859> on

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
really good gun and i think that even on

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.370 
really good gun and i think that even on
black<00:04:20.489> ops<00:04:20.700> gets<00:04:21.000> a<00:04:21.060> bad<00:04:21.239> rap<00:04:21.479> I<00:04:21.780> don't<00:04:22.320> think

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
black ops gets a bad rap I don't think

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.470 
black ops gets a bad rap I don't think
that<00:04:22.680> it's<00:04:22.770> really<00:04:22.860> deserve

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
that it's really deserve

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.380 
that it's really deserve
the<00:04:24.290> gun<00:04:24.500> balancing<00:04:25.040> isn't<00:04:25.370> perfect<00:04:25.850> but<00:04:26.030> I

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
the gun balancing isn't perfect but I

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:27.850 
the gun balancing isn't perfect but I
don't<00:04:26.570> think<00:04:26.660> it's<00:04:26.840> nearly<00:04:27.170> as<00:04:27.380> bad<00:04:27.560> as<00:04:27.740> a<00:04:27.770> lot

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
don't think it's nearly as bad as a lot

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.280 
don't think it's nearly as bad as a lot
of<00:04:27.980> people<00:04:28.190> make<00:04:28.850> it<00:04:28.970> out<00:04:29.060> to<00:04:29.120> be<00:04:29.300> now<00:04:29.990> with

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
of people make it out to be now with

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:31.930 
of people make it out to be now with
that<00:04:30.320> said<00:04:30.500> I<00:04:30.710> do<00:04:31.010> hope<00:04:31.400> that<00:04:31.430> there<00:04:31.760> are

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
that said I do hope that there are

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.980 
that said I do hope that there are
improvements<00:04:32.900> in<00:04:33.470> mw3<00:04:33.980> I<00:04:34.910> hope<00:04:35.330> that<00:04:35.540> you<00:04:35.810> can

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
improvements in mw3 I hope that you can

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.260 
improvements in mw3 I hope that you can
use<00:04:36.230> essentially<00:04:36.920> every<00:04:37.310> gun<00:04:37.550> at<00:04:37.910> you<00:04:38.180> know

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
use essentially every gun at you know

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.060 
use essentially every gun at you know
competitively<00:04:38.990> not<00:04:39.260> really<00:04:39.530> be<00:04:39.740> at<00:04:40.040> a

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
competitively not really be at a

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.770 
competitively not really be at a
disadvantage<00:04:40.360> think<00:04:41.360> that<00:04:41.510> that<00:04:41.630> would<00:04:41.720> be

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
disadvantage think that that would be

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.140 
disadvantage think that that would be
something<00:04:41.960> cool<00:04:42.640> because<00:04:43.640> there<00:04:43.940> are<00:04:44.000> a<00:04:44.030> lot

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
something cool because there are a lot

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.400 
something cool because there are a lot
of<00:04:44.180> guns<00:04:44.420> that<00:04:44.480> I<00:04:44.600> want<00:04:44.810> to<00:04:44.870> use<00:04:45.050> but<00:04:45.260> I<00:04:45.320> know

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
of guns that I want to use but I know

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.590 
of guns that I want to use but I know
that<00:04:45.530> if<00:04:45.800> I<00:04:45.890> do<00:04:45.950> I<00:04:46.340> will<00:04:46.370> have<00:04:47.150> a<00:04:47.180> much<00:04:47.390> harder

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
that if I do I will have a much harder

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.990 
that if I do I will have a much harder
time<00:04:47.780> and<00:04:48.710> you<00:04:49.160> know<00:04:49.280> in<00:04:49.400> competitive<00:04:49.880> it's

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
time and you know in competitive it's

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.900 
time and you know in competitive it's
all<00:04:50.120> about<00:04:50.270> winning<00:04:50.510> and<00:04:51.040> so<00:04:52.040> I'm<00:04:52.310> we're<00:04:52.730> kind

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
all about winning and so I'm we're kind

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.220

had<00:05:17.420> like<00:05:17.630> eight<00:05:17.870> story<00:05:18.260> building<00:05:18.350> do<00:05:18.860> is

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:18.950 
had like eight story building do is

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
insane so you know I hope they kind of

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.720 
insane so you know I hope they kind of
limit<00:05:21.020> that<00:05:21.170> if<00:05:21.470> not<00:05:21.980> just<00:05:22.190> remove<00:05:22.580> it

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730 
limit that if not just remove it

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.230 
limit that if not just remove it
altogether<00:05:23.330> I<00:05:24.050> think<00:05:24.770> that<00:05:25.040> will<00:05:25.240> definitely

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
altogether I think that will definitely

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.910 
altogether I think that will definitely
not<00:05:26.360> only<00:05:26.600> make<00:05:26.990> the<00:05:27.140> game<00:05:27.350> more<00:05:27.380> fun<00:05:27.590> for

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:27.920 
not only make the game more fun for

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.680 
not only make the game more fun for
casual<00:05:28.310> players<00:05:28.580> but<00:05:28.820> make<00:05:29.000> it<00:05:29.030> much<00:05:29.510> more

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
casual players but make it much more

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.020 
casual players but make it much more
suitable<00:05:30.020> for<00:05:30.140> the<00:05:30.410> competitive<00:05:30.950> players<00:05:31.190> so

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030 
suitable for the competitive players so

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.640 
suitable for the competitive players so
into<00:05:32.390> the<00:05:32.420> gameplay<00:05:32.660> does<00:05:33.020> this<00:05:33.380> is<00:05:33.500> the

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
into the gameplay does this is the

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.740
