00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 Here we are and welcome back to my new channel 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.750
 news videos and no video of 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.179
 updates on what is more advanced 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.460
 warfare then a few days ago vi 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.440
 I had talked about getting 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.210
 easily then being able to obtain 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.710
 faster than 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.199
 normal based on my experience 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.420
 personal supply balance sheets 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.430
 while today I wanted to talk again or 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.550
 better I wanted to talk to you about the speech 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.890
 linked advanced supply launches 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.570
 how do you know how to launch advanced minds 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.309
 they are much more important than the 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.160
 standard because it's possible in there 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.260
 find professional raco harvey ed 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.180
 he even elites as you know 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.280
 the net weapons can be unlocked ad 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.050
 every maximum prestige 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.820
 in this video I wanted to explain a 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.250
 how to get much more 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.680
 fast launches of advanced references 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.050
 practically if we play the maximums 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.730
 loans at maximum prestige ie 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.980
 from maximum prestige to another 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.320
 given a supply bidding box 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.949
 advanced so in this way it is a lot 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.080
 easier to get a launch 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.810
 advanced supply then more yes 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.030
 levels the power easier than the note 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.920
 this type of cash from another 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.470
 advice I must note that it is play 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.689
 as prestigious as possible for those who do 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.159
 it is stopped and obviously because it is not 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.960
 went ahead in every advice 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.509
 really playing as much as possible at 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.210
 game because because it is several days ago 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.210
 the possibility was introduced 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.490
 at levels 20 at levels 30 and levels 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.290
 40 of any prestige to obtain a 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.000
 then advanced supply launch 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.369
 which means that in practice for example 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.710
 I played the normal use prestige 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.840
 so I 'm at the level that we got it to 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.180
 level 20 or a crate arriving at level 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.940
 30 or a box arriving at level 40 one 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.490
 therefore corian caste 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.710
 twenty levels I made myself three cases of 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.570
 advanced supplies let us take the example 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.300
 instead of playing you play the maximums 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.880
 prestigious first highest prestige level 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.760
 20 a house at level 30 a house a 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.720
 level 40 a chest we see them again 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.010
 a house was practically a corner 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.770
 different levels 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.690
 another good four houses raises of 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.600
 advanced supplies then as you see 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.190
 the more you play the more you can get the 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.780
 thanks to advanced supply launches 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.880
 obviously to this novelty that is 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.650
 back a few days ago but must know 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.060
