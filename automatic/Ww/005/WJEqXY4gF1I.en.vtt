hey guys Ponce here on the PBE here to
show<00:00:02.100> you<00:00:02.159> guys<00:00:02.250> an<00:00:02.550> in-game<00:00:02.879> preview<00:00:03.389> of<00:00:03.570> the

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
show you guys an in-game preview of the

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.079 
show you guys an in-game preview of the
gangplank<00:00:04.500> rework<00:00:04.950> now<00:00:05.490> you<00:00:05.549> might<00:00:05.790> recall<00:00:06.029> I

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
gangplank rework now you might recall I

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.700 
gangplank rework now you might recall I
already<00:00:06.509> put<00:00:06.720> up<00:00:06.779> a<00:00:06.930> video<00:00:07.109> talking<00:00:07.440> about

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
already put up a video talking about

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.430 
already put up a video talking about
basically<00:00:08.340> what<00:00:08.580> everything<00:00:08.940> does<00:00:09.380> now<00:00:10.380> I'm

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
basically what everything does now I'm

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.660 
basically what everything does now I'm
not<00:00:10.559> going<00:00:10.679> to<00:00:10.740> go<00:00:10.830> into<00:00:10.920> exhaustive<00:00:11.519> detail

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
not going to go into exhaustive detail

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.039 
not going to go into exhaustive detail
what<00:00:12.000> each<00:00:12.150> ability<00:00:12.509> does<00:00:12.660> I'm<00:00:12.780> just<00:00:12.809> going<00:00:13.019> to

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
what each ability does I'm just going to

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.110 
what each ability does I'm just going to
kind<00:00:13.259> of<00:00:13.290> talk<00:00:13.469> about<00:00:13.769> roughly<00:00:14.759> what<00:00:14.910> they<00:00:15.059> do

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
kind of talk about roughly what they do

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.529 
kind of talk about roughly what they do
some<00:00:15.750> neat<00:00:15.990> tricks<00:00:16.020> with<00:00:16.500> them<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:17.420> their<00:00:18.420> you

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
some neat tricks with them and their you

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.120 
some neat tricks with them and their you
know<00:00:18.570> ratios<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.260> stuff<00:00:19.470> like<00:00:19.590> that<00:00:19.650> so<00:00:19.980> let's

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
know ratios and stuff like that so let's

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.429 
know ratios and stuff like that so let's
start<00:00:20.369> with<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.730> passive<00:00:21.180> trial<00:00:21.420> by<00:00:21.570> fire<00:00:21.810> so

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
start with the passive trial by fire so

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.109 
start with the passive trial by fire so
the<00:00:22.590> true<00:00:22.800> damage<00:00:23.160> actually<00:00:23.550> gets<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:23.910> believe

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
the true damage actually gets I believe

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.689 
the true damage actually gets I believe
a<00:00:24.439> 1.2<00:00:25.439> ad<00:00:27.109> bonus<00:00:28.109> or<00:00:28.380> bonus<00:00:28.680> ad<00:00:28.890> ratio<00:00:29.429> on<00:00:29.550> it

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
a 1.2 ad bonus or bonus ad ratio on it

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.959 
a 1.2 ad bonus or bonus ad ratio on it
so<00:00:29.880> 1.2<00:00:30.510> bonus<00:00:31.380> ad<00:00:31.650> ratio<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.369> pretty

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
so 1.2 bonus ad ratio is pretty

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.780 
so 1.2 bonus ad ratio is pretty
significant<00:00:33.690> that's<00:00:33.840> like<00:00:34.020> pretty<00:00:34.230> high<00:00:34.790> of

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
significant that's like pretty high of

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.100 
significant that's like pretty high of
course<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.149> has<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.360> timer<00:00:36.600> on<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:37.020> you

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
course it has the timer on it so you

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.540 
course it has the timer on it so you
don't<00:00:37.140> refresh<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.800> passive<00:00:38.190> over<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.489> over

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
don't refresh the passive over and over

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.470 
don't refresh the passive over and over
again<00:00:38.730> every<00:00:38.940> time<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.149> hit<00:00:39.270> something

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
again every time you hit something

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.470 
again every time you hit something
because<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:39.840> would<00:00:39.960> be<00:00:39.989> insane<00:00:40.440> but<00:00:41.480> moving

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
because that would be insane but moving

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.090 
because that would be insane but moving
on<00:00:42.540> let's<00:00:42.690> go<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.930> parlay<00:00:43.320> now<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.710> parlay

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
on let's go to parlay now the parlay

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.750 
on let's go to parlay now the parlay
base<00:00:44.370> damage<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.059> ratio<00:00:45.480> are<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.989> same

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
base damage and the ratio are the same

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.080 
base damage and the ratio are the same
that's<00:00:47.760> largely<00:00:49.070> no<00:00:50.070> not<00:00:50.340> changed<00:00:50.850> but

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
that's largely no not changed but

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.970 
that's largely no not changed but
there's<00:00:51.329> this<00:00:51.449> whole<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:52.199> don't<00:00:52.649> think<00:00:52.829> old

function and silver serpent that's the
whole<00:00:58.500> thing<00:00:58.649> working<00:00:59.489> with<00:00:59.609> assault<00:00:59.879> I'll

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
whole thing working with assault I'll

whole thing working with assault I'll
talk<00:01:00.180> about<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.449> in<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.750> minute<00:01:01.160> ok<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.370> get

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
silver serpents when you kill stuff I'll

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.350 
silver serpents when you kill stuff I'll
show<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.559> as<00:01:04.710> well<00:01:04.890> remove<00:01:05.880> scurvy

show you that as well remove scurvy

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.240 
show you that as well remove scurvy
that's<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:07.140> know<00:01:07.260> basically<00:01:07.470> functionally

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
that's you know basically functionally

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.130 
that's you know basically functionally
largely<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.030> same<00:01:09.150> except<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.600> gives<00:01:10.020> you

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
largely the same except it gives you

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.630 
largely the same except it gives you
back<00:01:10.320> fifteen<00:01:10.799> percent<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.220> missing

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
back fifteen percent of is missing

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.300 
back fifteen percent of is missing
health<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.510> scales<00:01:13.049> rather<00:01:13.380> poorly<00:01:13.770> like<00:01:14.130> you

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
health it scales rather poorly like you

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.609 
health it scales rather poorly like you
just<00:01:14.520> get<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.060> faster<00:01:15.810> cool<00:01:16.020> down<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.290> think

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
just get the faster cool down I think

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.969 
just get the faster cool down I think
and<00:01:17.689> it's<00:01:18.689> more<00:01:18.930> base<00:01:19.140> healing<00:01:19.619> but<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.920> know

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
and it's more base healing but you know

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.950 
and it's more base healing but you know
the<00:01:20.100> basic<00:01:20.369> Elena's<00:01:20.640> go<00:01:20.880> up<00:01:20.939> by<00:01:21.090> much<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.659> still

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
the basic Elena's go up by much it still

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.899 
the basic Elena's go up by much it still
does<00:01:22.140> have<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> 1<00:01:22.590> point<00:01:22.799> 0<00:01:22.979> AP<00:01:23.340> ratio<00:01:23.549> of

a little bit more but a powder keg it

a little bit more but a powder keg it

of<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.619> rather<00:01:41.450> place<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.659> powder<00:01:42.960> keg<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.290> can

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
of it rather place a powder keg that can

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.050 
of it rather place a powder keg that can
be<00:01:43.680> attacked<00:01:43.920> by<00:01:44.070> gangplank<00:01:44.549> or<00:01:44.700> as<00:01:44.759> enemies

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
be attacked by gangplank or as enemies

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.190 
be attacked by gangplank or as enemies
at<00:01:45.689> target<00:01:46.110> location<00:01:46.590> for<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.720> 60<00:01:48.720> seconds<00:01:49.140> so

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
at target location for the 60 seconds so

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.899 
at target location for the 60 seconds so
you<00:01:49.259> can<00:01:49.409> place<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.740> like<00:01:49.829> all<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.729> way<00:01:50.790> up

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
you can place it like all the way up

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.940 
you can place it like all the way up
there<00:01:51.119> like<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:52.970> let's<00:01:53.970> blow<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.180> up<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.479> see

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
there like that let's blow it up and see

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.440 
there like that let's blow it up and see

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
physical damage from the explosion and

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.470 
physical damage from the explosion and
that's<00:02:11.129> scaling<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:11.730> think<00:02:11.879> it<00:02:12.060> starts<00:02:12.390> at

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
that's scaling to I think it starts at

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.320 
that's scaling to I think it starts at
like<00:02:12.599> one

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
like one

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.090 
like one
one<00:02:14.330> something<00:02:14.870> it's<00:02:15.410> kind<00:02:15.650> of<00:02:15.710> it<00:02:15.830> doesn't

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
one something it's kind of it doesn't

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.620 
one something it's kind of it doesn't
scale<00:02:16.310> very<00:02:16.340> much<00:02:16.820> in<00:02:17.000> terms<00:02:17.120> of<00:02:17.270> the<00:02:17.360> bonus

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
scale very much in terms of the bonus

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.470 
scale very much in terms of the bonus
damage<00:02:17.830> so<00:02:18.830> yeah<00:02:19.310> putting<00:02:20.000> points<00:02:20.180> in<00:02:20.390> this

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
damage so yeah putting points in this

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.850 
damage so yeah putting points in this
doesn't<00:02:20.840> do<00:02:20.930> a<00:02:20.960> lot<00:02:21.050> it<00:02:21.320> mean<00:02:21.440> it<00:02:21.560> just<00:02:21.620> makes

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
doesn't do a lot it mean it just makes

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.150 
doesn't do a lot it mean it just makes
it<00:02:21.980> slower<00:02:22.280> do<00:02:22.760> a<00:02:22.790> little<00:02:23.090> bigger<00:02:23.780> slow<00:02:24.170> do

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
it slower do a little bigger slow do

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.880 
it slower do a little bigger slow do
slightly<00:02:25.460> more<00:02:25.700> damage<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:26.410> it<00:02:27.410> affects<00:02:27.740> how

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
slightly more damage and it affects how

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.140 
slightly more damage and it affects how
many<00:02:28.070> charges<00:02:28.370> you<00:02:28.580> get<00:02:28.730> and<00:02:28.850> stuff<00:02:28.970> like<00:02:29.090> that

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
many charges you get and stuff like that

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.410 
many charges you get and stuff like that
but<00:02:29.990> yeah<00:02:30.380> when<00:02:30.770> a<00:02:30.800> que<00:02:31.340> explodes<00:02:31.820> other<00:02:32.090> kegs

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
but yeah when a que explodes other kegs

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.180 
but yeah when a que explodes other kegs
with<00:02:32.630> overlapping<00:02:33.020> blast<00:02:33.500> zone<00:02:33.800> chain

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
with overlapping blast zone chain

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.430 
with overlapping blast zone chain
explode<00:02:34.730> damage<00:02:35.480> does<00:02:35.660> not<00:02:35.840> stack<00:02:36.140> because

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
explode damage does not stack because

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.370 
explode damage does not stack because
that<00:02:36.830> would<00:02:36.950> be<00:02:37.070> a<00:02:37.310> overpowered<00:02:38.080> kegs<00:02:39.080> health

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
that would be a overpowered kegs health

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.860 
that would be a overpowered kegs health
decays<00:02:39.770> every<00:02:40.250> point<00:02:40.550> five<00:02:40.790> seconds<00:02:41.330> decay

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.310 
decays every point five seconds decay
rate<00:02:42.110> increased<00:02:42.500> at<00:02:42.680> level<00:02:42.950> 7<00:02:43.340> and<00:02:43.550> 13<00:02:44.320> so

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
rate increased at level 7 and 13 so

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.560 
rate increased at level 7 and 13 so
basically<00:02:45.650> the<00:02:46.550> higher<00:02:46.730> level<00:02:47.000> you<00:02:47.090> are<00:02:47.180> the

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
basically the higher level you are the

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.260 
basically the higher level you are the
faster<00:02:48.020> the<00:02:48.340> HP<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.490> keg<00:02:49.640> goes<00:02:49.850> down<00:02:50.030> because

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
faster the HP the keg goes down because

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.750 
faster the HP the keg goes down because
basically<00:02:50.480> at<00:02:50.870> max<00:02:51.440> HP<00:02:51.709> @<00:02:52.010> k<00:02:52.160> can<00:02:52.370> take<00:02:52.520> three

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
basically at max HP @ k can take three

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.460 
basically at max HP @ k can take three
hits<00:02:52.970> it's<00:02:53.240> kind<00:02:53.390> of<00:02:53.480> like<00:02:53.540> a<00:02:53.630> ward<00:02:53.930> right<00:02:54.110> easy

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
hits it's kind of like a ward right easy

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.530 
hits it's kind of like a ward right easy
starts<00:02:55.310> at<00:02:55.430> three<00:02:55.459> hits<00:02:55.760> it<00:02:55.940> slowly<00:02:56.209> decays

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
starts at three hits it slowly decays

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.560 
starts at three hits it slowly decays
down<00:02:56.870> and<00:02:57.110> once<00:02:57.740> it's<00:02:58.220> a<00:02:58.340> one<00:02:59.060> I<00:02:59.209> just<00:02:59.240> hated

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
down and once it's a one I just hated

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.449 
down and once it's a one I just hated
like<00:02:59.780> that<00:02:59.990> now<00:03:00.500> if<00:03:00.620> I<00:03:00.680> hit<00:03:00.830> it<00:03:00.950> automatically

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
like that now if I hit it automatically

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.100 
like that now if I hit it automatically
as<00:03:01.520> you<00:03:01.610> can<00:03:01.760> see<00:03:01.910> I<00:03:01.940> don't<00:03:02.150> want<00:03:02.300> like<00:03:02.690> I<00:03:02.930> don't

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
as you can see I don't want like I don't

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.650 
as you can see I don't want like I don't
kill<00:03:03.530> it<00:03:03.650> I<00:03:03.800> took<00:03:04.370> off<00:03:04.670> one<00:03:04.850> HP<00:03:05.090> than<00:03:05.330> a<00:03:05.390> tick

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
kill it I took off one HP than a tick

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.740 
kill it I took off one HP than a tick
down<00:03:06.370> it's<00:03:07.370> ready<00:03:07.610> to<00:03:07.730> go<00:03:07.760> incidentally<00:03:08.660> you

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
down it's ready to go incidentally you

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.670 
down it's ready to go incidentally you

counts<00:03:13.070> as<00:03:13.160> one<00:03:13.430> hit<00:03:13.700> so<00:03:14.180> if<00:03:14.330> you<00:03:14.510> let's<00:03:15.080> wait

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
counts as one hit so if you let's wait

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.070 
counts as one hit so if you let's wait
for<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:15.440> cooldown<00:03:15.800> watch<00:03:16.070> this<00:03:17.080> Harley

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
for the cooldown watch this Harley

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.750 
for the cooldown watch this Harley
immediately<00:03:18.650> it<00:03:18.830> doesn't<00:03:19.130> kill<00:03:19.310> it<00:03:19.430> so<00:03:19.670> you

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
immediately it doesn't kill it so you

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.750 
immediately it doesn't kill it so you
