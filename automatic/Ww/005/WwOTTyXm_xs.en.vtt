00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:18.310
 time of day dear lovers 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:21.820
 sunny i water vine in this 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:25.200
 video I want to tell one of the methods 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:33.610
 how to cook soil mix for 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:35.559
 growing seedlings immediately say no 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:40.230
 need to take this method as a basis 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:45.839
 way is just one way 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:49.479
 someone easier to buy soil in the store 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:53.110
 to us specialized Cossacks free 

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:59.470
 Don Cossacks steppe easier to do it 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:01:05.409
 mix it up for it myself i think 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:08.940
 everywhere forest landing strip can be such 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:12.729
 landing go it is desirable that it was 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.579
 Do not be angry pine planting is not oak but 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.570
 so mixed 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:21.670
 fortune telling or acacias as in acacias 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.929
 there is also a strawberry bean pick 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:31.960
 bacteria that will fix nitrogen 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:33.100
 we find such a place about 1 shoot 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.979
 top leaf 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.979
 Of course, it is better to harvest soil 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.830
 not if the more you start early 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.450
 heal seedlings 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:49.330
 remove the top layer of leaves afterwards 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:50.250
 remove a small layer of soil and recruit 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:55.270
 this soil 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.560
 then this soil is sifted and then 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:01.240
 then I will tell you how to do and let 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:04.960
 itâ€™s good for everybody that she was 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.920
 that basic major trace element macro 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:12.700
 and trace elements 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:15.520
 potassium and nitrogen is very good for 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.739
 development of both root system and 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.739
 ground part of the seedling movie 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:23.110
 traditional meditation part yet 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.640
 well this is what mushrooms prevail here 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.770
 so -called mycorrhiza 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.720
 which perform the transport function 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.870
 of all these nutrients that 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.180
 are they available forms translates 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.870
 it is in an accessible form and delivers already to 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:44.410
 the roots are recruited this top layer 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:48.880
 lands he is also the soil if what 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:51.700
 lumpy roots comes across can 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.489
 sift through and pick something up 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.959
 extra leaves of roots if grass 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:01.470
 hit think it doesn't hurt much 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:07.410
 fluff spoke enough 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:10.390
 trace elements it is quite moisture-consuming 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.940
 Well, we need all the same that she was 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:17.829
 slightly looser for this you can 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:21.720
 can use sawdust 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:25.150
 sawdust if they are his fresh can 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:28.530
 steam them or steam it 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.970
 there will also be an additional disinfection 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:35.100
 add a protein to make 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:38.790
 soil is soil mixture for seedlings 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:41.739
 more moisture capacious and more 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.510
 breathable as it will 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.989
 good for future growth 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:51.310
 roots because moisture will be superfluous 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:52.730
 leave well on the which will have to 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.849
 she will linger 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.730
 and good aeration for the soil will be good 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:01.610
 in carne the roots will breathe well not 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:05.269
 gasp as major mistakes are 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:08.750
 with excessive watering the roots suffocate 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:11.810
 seedling begins to die will give 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:14.360
 more carry breathability to 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:18.470
 oxygen was retained by the soil which is from 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:22.190
 water will be available at an approximate 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:25.300
 correlation with such soil somewhere 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:29.330
 approximately one to two three that is 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:33.440
 one piece of sawdust 2 3 pieces of land 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:36.590
 such a good landing of ground sawdust places 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:40.940
 can use external sand but 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:43.760
 sand for this business is better to take river 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.710
 topic then this is the usual builders since 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:51.050
 normal construction sand these particles 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:52.970
 grit they how to become more this sharp 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:57.110
 angles in them and due to this when you 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:05:00.919
 water water run down wash 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:03.800
 sand in river sand they are more round 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:07.070
 and these grains of sand remain in that place 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.940
 where did they go so do why in 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.000
 soil mixture 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:15.340
 three pieces of 2 or 3 pieces of land there 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:21.650
 look necessary and sawdust one part sawdust 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:24.080
 here's the perry soil mix well 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:29.599
 shuffle the excess can that blade of grass 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:32.030
 come across pebbles throw them out just 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:32.570
 the ground is very wet so she 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.830
 a little bit 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:41.750
 u skated but it's not terribly mixed 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:44.030
 well and now considers this pochvosmes 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:46.660
 itself will be ok for growing 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.660
 seedlings 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.540
 since there is nobody easier to buy in of course 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:56.820
 the store is buying well the point is that you 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.070
 buy in a store you don't know what's there 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:03.800
 It is here that I sit over the years and 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:07.680
 For decades , muse has accumulated and 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:10.410
 I think a great option because 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:13.890
 more fried cuvee eat mycorrhiza mushrooms 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:16.470
 of this transport function you sapling 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:18.510
 It will develop a fine 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:21.240
 soil mixture it will be enough 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:24.140
 moisture-absorbing nutrients will 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:27.600
 well, well, a lot of here still want to say 

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:32.400
 don't say they don't invent 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:35.610
 bike is not there such a principle to mess 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:38.090
 oil you will not spoil 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:42.330
 people make gain fertile land 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:45.390
 there is still peat there then land with 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:49.020
 fertile from the store humus do not know 

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:51.540
 biohumus then into the plant begins to pore 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:55.500
 don't get burned sore gasp strongly 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:57.060
 trude moss soil is not necessary as it is 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:01.380
 same as a transit point for your 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:03.360
 a seedling will literally need someone there 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.280
 when I started growing seedlings there 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:09.360
 month or two 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:11.060
 so that the seedling is adapted when 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:15.570
 the threat of recurring frosts is over 

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:18.480
 what zone is interesting there as there 1 

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:22.080
 reports my middle was already possible 

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:25.650
 dried out land in one for permanent 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:29.070
 the place is soil only as transshipment 

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:32.420
 item you will have for sapling iraq for 

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:37.140
 good development is enough for him 

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:40.280
 micro macronutrient nutrition well and sawdust 

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:43.950
 how baking powder will act 

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:47.580
 you will add sawdust yourself from me 

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:50.409
 I think here a little more to add to 

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:51.969
 principle so if 

00:07:50.409 --> 00:07:54.269
 whom will desire in the comments 

00:07:51.969 --> 00:07:57.129
 share what let you not do 

00:07:54.269 --> 00:07:59.909
 subscribe to the channel of all good 

00:07:57.129 --> 00:07:59.909
 you daughter
