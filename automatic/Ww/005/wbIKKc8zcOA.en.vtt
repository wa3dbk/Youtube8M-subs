is due to the fact that open air

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.929 
is due to the fact that open air
headphones<00:01:07.950> do<00:01:08.760> not<00:01:09.060> seal<00:01:09.630> off<00:01:09.900> your<00:01:10.200> ears<00:01:10.439> as

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.289 
conventional headphones do instead they
