game<00:00:49.800> not<00:00:50.129> because<00:00:50.309> we<00:00:50.640> took<00:00:50.850> Weber<00:00:51.780> State<00:00:51.840> for

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
game not because we took Weber State for

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.500 
game not because we took Weber State for
granted<00:00:52.680> thought<00:00:53.250> we<00:00:53.370> had<00:00:53.489> some<00:00:53.699> anxiety<00:00:54.329> we

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
granted thought we had some anxiety we

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.330 
granted thought we had some anxiety we
dropped<00:00:54.780> some<00:00:54.989> balls<00:00:55.199> missed<00:00:55.620> some<00:00:55.770> shots<00:00:55.800> and

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
dropped some balls missed some shots and

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.020 
dropped some balls missed some shots and
got<00:00:56.730> down<00:00:57.410> 7-0<00:00:58.460> once<00:00:59.460> we<00:00:59.609> got<00:00:59.730> through<00:00:59.940> that

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
got down 7-0 once we got through that

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.340 
got down 7-0 once we got through that
stretch<00:01:00.420> played<00:01:00.809> some<00:01:00.989> really<00:01:01.230> good

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
stretch played some really good

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.950 
stretch played some really good
basketball<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:02.250> then<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.210> think<00:01:03.539> for<00:01:03.750> about

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
basketball and then I think for about

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.810 
basketball and then I think for about
half<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.589> second<00:01:04.979> half<00:01:05.100> we<00:01:05.309> did<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.610> same

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
half of the second half we did the same

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.420 
half of the second half we did the same
thing<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.360> then<00:01:07.110> we<00:01:07.229> let<00:01:07.409> our<00:01:07.530> guard<00:01:07.799> down<00:01:07.920> I

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
thing and then we let our guard down I

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.310 
thing and then we let our guard down I
didn't<00:01:09.060> think<00:01:09.150> we<00:01:09.330> finished<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.810> game<00:01:09.990> well

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
didn't think we finished the game well

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
moment in the game that really put it

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.859 
moment in the game that really put it
over<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.150> top<00:01:39.180> for<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:39.780> guys<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:41.540> never<00:01:42.540> felt

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
over the top for you guys I never felt

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.800 
over the top for you guys I never felt
the<00:01:42.990> game<00:01:43.170> was<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:43.500> doubt<00:01:43.939> they<00:01:44.939> made<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.180> really

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
the game was in doubt they made a really

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.510 
the game was in doubt they made a really
good<00:01:45.990> run<00:01:46.290> but<00:01:46.470> i<00:01:46.530> think<00:01:46.770> our<00:01:46.890> lead<00:01:47.100> was<00:01:47.340> as

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
good run but i think our lead was as

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.810 
good run but i think our lead was as
many<00:01:47.759> as<00:01:47.970> 18<00:01:48.390> 20<00:01:49.070> once<00:01:50.070> we<00:01:50.280> got<00:01:50.430> through<00:01:50.670> the

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
many as 18 20 once we got through the

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.420 
many as 18 20 once we got through the
first<00:01:51.000> four<00:01:51.360> minutes<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.869> game<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.430> felt

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
first four minutes of the game I felt

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.609 
first four minutes of the game I felt
like<00:01:53.549> we<00:01:53.729> were<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:53.939> control<00:01:54.649> but<00:01:57.259> you<00:01:58.259> know<00:01:58.350> I

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
like we were in control but you know I

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.889 
like we were in control but you know I
think<00:01:59.310> just<00:01:59.460> looking<00:01:59.820> at<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.000> one<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:00.810> the

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
think just looking at it one of the

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.380 
think just looking at it one of the
things<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:02.460> asked<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.759> question<00:02:02.790> in<00:02:03.299> the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
things in you asked the question in the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.380 
things in you asked the question in the
back<00:02:03.570> about<00:02:04.259> teams<00:02:05.250> making<00:02:05.640> more<00:02:05.939> free<00:02:06.180> throws

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
back about teams making more free throws

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.469 
back about teams making more free throws
and<00:02:06.600> we<00:02:06.689> attempt<00:02:07.520> that's<00:02:08.520> not<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:08.879> problem<00:02:09.239> for

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
and we attempt that's not a problem for

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.150 
and we attempt that's not a problem for
our<00:02:09.690> offense<00:02:10.140> that's<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.470> problem<00:02:10.709> for<00:02:10.920> our

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
our offense that's a problem for our

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.670 
our offense that's a problem for our
defense

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
defense

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.949 
defense
when<00:02:12.799> you<00:02:12.890> think<00:02:13.129> about<00:02:13.219> it<00:02:13.400> out<00:02:14.150> of<00:02:14.299> there<00:02:14.420> 59

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
when you think about it out of there 59

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.160 
when you think about it out of there 59
points<00:02:15.290> that<00:02:15.590> they<00:02:15.620> scored<00:02:16.359> 20<00:02:17.359> of<00:02:17.480> their<00:02:17.629> 59

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
points that they scored 20 of their 59

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.099 
points that they scored 20 of their 59
came<00:02:18.500> from<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:18.769> foul<00:02:18.950> line<00:02:19.209> now<00:02:20.209> they<00:02:20.359> went<00:02:20.569> 24

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:21.109 
came from the foul line now they went 24

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:24.459 
came from the foul line now they went 24
23<00:02:21.579> but<00:02:22.579> I<00:02:22.609> think<00:02:22.909> five<00:02:23.689> different<00:02:24.230> times

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:24.469 
23 but I think five different times

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:27.429 
23 but I think five different times
during<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:25.189> game<00:02:25.569> with<00:02:26.569> five<00:02:26.870> seconds<00:02:27.349> or

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:27.439 
during the game with five seconds or

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:30.250 
during the game with five seconds or
less<00:02:27.620> under<00:02:27.950> on<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.400> shot<00:02:28.819> clock<00:02:29.019> one<00:02:30.019> of<00:02:30.170> our

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
less under on the shot clock one of our

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.470 
less under on the shot clock one of our
perimeter<00:02:30.829> defenders<00:02:31.370> reached<00:02:32.000> in<00:02:32.269> and

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
perimeter defenders reached in and

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.690 
perimeter defenders reached in and
fouled<00:02:32.950> just<00:02:33.950> a<00:02:34.099> complete<00:02:34.459> lack<00:02:34.639> of

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
fouled just a complete lack of

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.449 
fouled just a complete lack of
discipline<00:02:35.389> lack<00:02:35.840> of<00:02:36.019> concentration<00:02:36.459> you

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
discipline lack of concentration you

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.849 
discipline lack of concentration you
know<00:02:37.579> you're<00:02:38.000> going<00:02:38.209> to<00:02:38.329> foul<00:02:38.659> in<00:02:39.019> the<00:02:39.530> game<00:02:39.680> of

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:39.859 
know you're going to foul in the game of

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:42.129 
know you're going to foul in the game of
basketball<00:02:40.180> but<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.299> silly<00:02:41.540> regions

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:42.139 
basketball but the silly regions

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:44.500 
basketball but the silly regions
especially<00:02:42.530> when<00:02:43.159> the<00:02:43.280> shot<00:02:43.609> clocks<00:02:43.969> that<00:02:44.120> low

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
especially when the shot clocks that low

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.409 
especially when the shot clocks that low
it<00:02:44.780> makes<00:02:45.769> it<00:02:45.980> difficult<00:02:46.189> because<00:02:46.760> they're

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:47.419 
it makes it difficult because they're

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:48.520 
it makes it difficult because they're
either<00:02:47.540> going<00:02:47.689> to<00:02:47.750> go<00:02:47.900> the<00:02:48.019> foul<00:02:48.230> line<00:02:48.500> and

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
either going to go the foul line and

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.819 
either going to go the foul line and
shoot<00:02:48.950> or<00:02:49.669> they<00:02:49.879> get<00:02:50.030> a<00:02:50.209> brand-new<00:02:50.629> 35<00:02:51.260> seconds

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:51.829 
shoot or they get a brand-new 35 seconds

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:53.949 
shoot or they get a brand-new 35 seconds
and<00:02:51.950> they<00:02:52.010> get<00:02:52.189> another<00:02:52.430> possession<00:02:52.849> if<00:02:53.209> we

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
and they get another possession if we

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.449 
and they get another possession if we
would<00:02:54.109> have<00:02:54.169> been<00:02:54.409> more<00:02:54.590> disciplined<00:02:55.280> with

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
would have been more disciplined with

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.330 
would have been more disciplined with
our<00:02:55.639> fouls<00:02:56.200> kept<00:02:57.200> them<00:02:57.379> off<00:02:57.620> the<00:02:57.799> line<00:02:58.010> we

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
our fouls kept them off the line we

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.220 
our fouls kept them off the line we
would<00:02:58.459> have<00:02:58.579> had<00:02:58.760> an<00:02:59.000> incredible<00:02:59.629> defensive

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
would have had an incredible defensive

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.229 
would have had an incredible defensive
performance<00:03:00.739> that's<00:03:01.519> why<00:03:01.730> when<00:03:01.909> you<00:03:02.000> look<00:03:02.120> at

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
performance that's why when you look at

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.170 
performance that's why when you look at
the<00:03:02.329> statue<00:03:02.919> they<00:03:03.919> shot<00:03:04.189> thirty<00:03:04.519> percent<00:03:04.909> for

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
the statue they shot thirty percent for

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.110 
the statue they shot thirty percent for
the<00:03:05.299> game<00:03:05.510> and<00:03:06.280> we<00:03:07.280> shot<00:03:07.489> fifty<00:03:07.879> five<00:03:08.090> percent

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
the game and we shot fifty five percent

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.059 
the game and we shot fifty five percent
for<00:03:08.629> the<00:03:08.719> game<00:03:08.900> and<00:03:09.139> usually<00:03:09.950> when<00:03:10.010> that

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
for the game and usually when that

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:11.770 
for the game and usually when that
happens<00:03:10.579> the<00:03:10.700> score<00:03:11.000> is<00:03:11.120> even<00:03:11.209> more<00:03:11.540> lopsided

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
happens the score is even more lopsided

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.770 
happens the score is even more lopsided
but<00:03:12.439> we<00:03:13.069> negated<00:03:13.639> some<00:03:13.849> of<00:03:13.969> our<00:03:14.090> great<00:03:14.299> defense

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
but we negated some of our great defense

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.659 
but we negated some of our great defense
with<00:03:14.989> reaching<00:03:15.200> in<00:03:15.560> and<00:03:15.739> that's<00:03:16.250> something<00:03:16.489> we

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:16.669 
with reaching in and that's something we

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:18.129 
with reaching in and that's something we
have<00:03:16.790> to<00:03:16.940> correct<00:03:17.209> moving<00:03:17.690> forward<00:03:18.019> we've

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:18.139 
have to correct moving forward we've

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:19.509 
have to correct moving forward we've
been<00:03:18.319> doing<00:03:18.590> that<00:03:18.620> though<00:03:18.919> especially<00:03:19.129> in<00:03:19.459> the

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
been doing that though especially in the

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.210 
been doing that though especially in the
second<00:03:19.879> half<00:03:19.909> and<00:03:20.470> tonight<00:03:21.470> yet<00:03:21.769> was<00:03:21.919> another

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
second half and tonight yet was another

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.460 
second half and tonight yet was another
reminder<00:03:22.579> that<00:03:22.970> for<00:03:23.540> us<00:03:23.599> to<00:03:23.750> be<00:03:24.079> the<00:03:24.290> great

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
reminder that for us to be the great

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.229 
reminder that for us to be the great
defensive<00:03:25.069> team<00:03:25.099> that<00:03:25.489> we<00:03:25.579> are<00:03:25.819> moving

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
defensive team that we are moving

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.960 
defensive team that we are moving
forward<00:03:26.590> we<00:03:27.590> have<00:03:27.680> to<00:03:27.829> foul<00:03:28.040> less<00:03:28.340> and<00:03:28.639> I<00:03:28.760> think

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
forward we have to foul less and I think

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.210 
forward we have to foul less and I think
we<00:03:29.060> can<00:03:29.209> control<00:03:29.569> that<00:03:29.750> Shawn<00:03:30.739> you<00:03:30.769> called<00:03:31.099> the

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
we can control that Shawn you called the

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.979 
we can control that Shawn you called the
timeout<00:03:31.549> with<00:03:31.729> about<00:03:31.909> 17<00:03:32.419> minutes<00:03:32.510> ago<00:03:32.810> in<00:03:32.840> the

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
timeout with about 17 minutes ago in the

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.259 
timeout with about 17 minutes ago in the
second<00:03:33.319> half<00:03:33.470> year<00:03:33.709> up<00:03:33.799> by<00:03:33.889> about<00:03:33.979> 15<00:03:34.579> was<00:03:35.150> that

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
second half year up by about 15 was that

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.119 
second half year up by about 15 was that
just<00:03:35.419> a<00:03:35.540> normal<00:03:35.569> procedure<00:03:36.319> for<00:03:36.769> you<00:03:36.859> at<00:03:36.979> that

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:37.129 
just a normal procedure for you at that

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:39.969 
just a normal procedure for you at that
time<00:03:37.340> no<00:03:38.000> we<00:03:38.209> talked<00:03:38.870> a<00:03:38.989> lot<00:03:39.169> about<00:03:39.229> ball<00:03:39.739> and

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:39.979 
time no we talked a lot about ball and

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:42.909 
time no we talked a lot about ball and
boy<00:03:40.099> before<00:03:40.849> the<00:03:41.060> game<00:03:41.359> I<00:03:41.689> feel<00:03:42.169> like<00:03:42.560> he's<00:03:42.769> an

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:42.919 
boy before the game I feel like he's an

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:46.719 
boy before the game I feel like he's an
NBA<00:03:43.069> player<00:03:44.500> we<00:03:45.500> have<00:03:45.680> not<00:03:45.829> faced<00:03:46.250> the<00:03:46.430> player

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:46.729 
NBA player we have not faced the player

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:48.699 
NBA player we have not faced the player
who's<00:03:47.090> a<00:03:47.120> better<00:03:47.389> offensive<00:03:48.079> rebounder<00:03:48.530> than

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
who's a better offensive rebounder than

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.520 
who's a better offensive rebounder than
him<00:03:48.859> I<00:03:49.099> think<00:03:50.060> he<00:03:50.299> leads<00:03:50.780> the<00:03:50.930> nation<00:03:51.079> or<00:03:51.439> he's

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
him I think he leads the nation or he's

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.280 
him I think he leads the nation or he's
close<00:03:51.829> to<00:03:51.859> leading<00:03:52.250> the<00:03:52.310> nation<00:03:52.459> we<00:03:52.759> knew<00:03:52.939> that

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
close to leading the nation we knew that

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.330 
close to leading the nation we knew that
so<00:03:54.290> we<00:03:54.799> gave<00:03:54.979> up<00:03:55.220> to<00:03:55.459> second<00:03:55.939> shots<00:03:56.739> to<00:03:57.739> him<00:03:58.069> I

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
so we gave up to second shots to him I

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.339 
so we gave up to second shots to him I
think<00:03:59.150> on<00:03:59.299> the<00:03:59.419> first<00:03:59.659> two<00:03:59.840> shots<00:04:00.049> of<00:04:00.259> the

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
think on the first two shots of the

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.499 
think on the first two shots of the
second<00:04:00.680> half<00:04:00.909> so<00:04:01.909> it's<00:04:02.239> something<00:04:02.389> we

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:02.509 
second half so it's something we

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:04.509 
second half so it's something we
emphasized<00:04:03.049> I<00:04:03.379> wanted<00:04:03.709> to<00:04:03.799> just<00:04:03.949> make<00:04:04.159> sure<00:04:04.340> on

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
emphasized I wanted to just make sure on

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.960 
emphasized I wanted to just make sure on
our<00:04:04.699> end<00:04:04.939> that<00:04:05.900> once<00:04:06.109> again<00:04:06.699> that<00:04:07.699> were

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
our end that once again that were

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.240 
our end that once again that were
responsible<00:04:08.720> and<00:04:09.049> doing<00:04:09.500> the<00:04:09.709> things<00:04:09.739> that<00:04:10.040> we

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
responsible and doing the things that we

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.149 
responsible and doing the things that we
need<00:04:10.489> we<00:04:10.759> know<00:04:11.000> we<00:04:11.180> need<00:04:11.359> to<00:04:11.569> do<00:04:11.750> to<00:04:12.470> win<00:04:12.650> and<00:04:12.979> to

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:13.159 
need we know we need to do to win and to

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:14.619 
need we know we need to do to win and to
give<00:04:13.310> him<00:04:13.489> second<00:04:13.909> shots<00:04:14.090> he<00:04:14.299> ended<00:04:14.479> with

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:14.629 
give him second shots he ended with

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:16.870 
give him second shots he ended with
seven<00:04:15.019> but<00:04:15.739> I<00:04:15.769> think<00:04:16.009> he<00:04:16.130> kept<00:04:16.400> a<00:04:16.519> couple

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
seven but I think he kept a couple

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.569 
seven but I think he kept a couple
others<00:04:17.150> alive<00:04:17.509> I<00:04:17.870> no<00:04:18.349> ronde<00:04:18.949> fouled<00:04:19.280> him<00:04:19.459> on<00:04:19.519> a

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
others alive I no ronde fouled him on a

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.209 
others alive I no ronde fouled him on a
block<00:04:19.880> out<00:04:20.090> I<00:04:20.389> believe<00:04:21.139> he<00:04:21.229> had<00:04:21.349> more<00:04:21.560> towards

00:04:22.209 --> 00:04:22.219 
block out I believe he had more towards

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:24.360 
block out I believe he had more towards
ten<00:04:22.550> offensive<00:04:22.760> rebounds<00:04:23.599> than

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
ten offensive rebounds than

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.189 
ten offensive rebounds than
now<00:04:25.370> his<00:04:25.610> partner<00:04:26.060> at<00:04:26.150> resnik<00:04:26.569> we<00:04:26.750> trapped<00:04:27.050> him

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 
now his partner at resnik we trapped him

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:29.140 
now his partner at resnik we trapped him
and<00:04:27.800> I<00:04:27.860> thought<00:04:28.039> we<00:04:28.189> did<00:04:28.340> an<00:04:28.430> outstanding<00:04:28.550> job

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
and I thought we did an outstanding job

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.719 
and I thought we did an outstanding job
he<00:04:29.569> had<00:04:29.659> one<00:04:29.810> field<00:04:30.139> goal<00:04:30.229> in<00:04:30.379> the<00:04:30.469> game<00:04:30.729> so

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
he had one field goal in the game so

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:35.080 
he had one field goal in the game so
part<00:04:32.090> of<00:04:32.210> what<00:04:32.710> Bolin<00:04:33.710> boy<00:04:33.889> enjoyed<00:04:34.639> was<00:04:35.060> the

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
part of what Bolin boy enjoyed was the

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.149 
part of what Bolin boy enjoyed was the
fact<00:04:35.479> that<00:04:35.599> his<00:04:35.780> man<00:04:35.990> was<00:04:36.199> trapping<00:04:36.500> Trez<00:04:36.919> Nick

00:04:37.149 --> 00:04:37.159 
fact that his man was trapping Trez Nick

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:40.629 
fact that his man was trapping Trez Nick
but<00:04:38.120> I<00:04:38.389> know<00:04:39.199> someone<00:04:39.439> said<00:04:39.770> moving<00:04:40.159> forward
