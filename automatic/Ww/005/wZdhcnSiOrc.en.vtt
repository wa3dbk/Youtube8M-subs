00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.660 
you can say that a shoe for a sprinter

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.050 
you can say that a shoe for a sprinter
will<00:00:19.870> help<00:00:20.140> them<00:00:20.380> gain<00:00:20.710> a<00:00:20.980> few<00:00:21.280> milliseconds

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060 
will help them gain a few milliseconds

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.330 
will help them gain a few milliseconds
but<00:00:22.270> really<00:00:22.810> not<00:00:23.020> that<00:00:23.200> much<00:00:23.410> lowly<00:00:23.830> equipment

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340

control when playing the production

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.250 
control when playing the production
that<00:01:05.710> was<00:01:05.800> one<00:01:06.190> of<00:01:06.310> the<00:01:06.460> key<00:01:07.300> features<00:01:07.630> that<00:01:07.900> we

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
that was one of the key features that we

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.690 
that was one of the key features that we
wanted<00:01:08.530> to<00:01:08.680> work<00:01:08.890> on<00:01:09.130> there's<00:01:09.460> protection

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
wanted to work on there's protection

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.870 
wanted to work on there's protection
through<00:01:10.690> the<00:01:10.870> palm<00:01:11.110> but<00:01:11.830> we've<00:01:12.130> also<00:01:12.310> worked<00:01:12.670> a

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
through the palm but we've also worked a

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.149 
through the palm but we've also worked a
lot<00:01:13.030> on<00:01:13.300> the<00:01:13.479> protection<00:01:13.840> at<00:01:14.470> the<00:01:14.710> back<00:01:14.920> of<00:01:14.950> the

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
lot on the protection at the back of the

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.250 
lot on the protection at the back of the
glove<00:01:15.370> so<00:01:15.670> a<00:01:15.700> lot<00:01:15.940> of<00:01:15.970> sticks<00:01:16.659> come<00:01:16.930> in<00:01:17.080> even

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
glove so a lot of sticks come in even

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.920 
glove so a lot of sticks come in even
skates<00:01:17.740> you<00:01:17.979> know<00:01:18.100> a<00:01:18.130> lot<00:01:18.430> of<00:01:18.610> slashes<00:01:19.120> so<00:01:19.780> the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
skates you know a lot of slashes so the

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.819 
skates you know a lot of slashes so the
access<00:01:20.320> flex<00:01:20.530> system<00:01:20.800> is<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:22.450> key<00:01:23.259> that<00:01:23.590> we

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:23.829 
access flex system is this key that we

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:27.450 
access flex system is this key that we
have<00:01:23.979> designed<00:01:24.549> instead<00:01:25.509> of<00:01:25.659> being<00:01:26.460> attached

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
have designed instead of being attached

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.600 
have designed instead of being attached
at<00:01:27.729> these<00:01:27.939> points<00:01:28.420> it<00:01:28.990> actually<00:01:29.530> goes<00:01:29.740> into<00:01:30.100> a

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
at these points it actually goes into a

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.410 
at these points it actually goes into a
system<00:01:31.210> of<00:01:31.540> tents<00:01:31.930> there's<00:01:32.110> one<00:01:32.380> right<00:01:32.560> here

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
system of tents there's one right here

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.600 
system of tents there's one right here
here<00:01:34.420> you<00:01:34.960> get<00:01:35.200> a<00:01:35.259> glove<00:01:35.530> that<00:01:35.770> closes<00:01:36.369> and

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
here you get a glove that closes and

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.770 
here you get a glove that closes and
opens<00:01:36.939> quite<00:01:37.689> easy<00:01:39.119> we've<00:01:40.119> added<00:01:40.329> two<00:01:40.600> discs

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
opens quite easy we've added two discs

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.230 
opens quite easy we've added two discs
love<00:01:41.079> a<00:01:41.320> removable<00:01:41.950> palm<00:01:42.460> so<00:01:42.880> you<00:01:42.939> can

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
love a removable palm so you can

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.569 
love a removable palm so you can
completely<00:01:43.689> remove<00:01:44.049> all<00:01:44.500> the<00:01:44.829> liner<00:01:45.130> of<00:01:45.460> the

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:45.579 
completely remove all the liner of the

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:46.859 
completely remove all the liner of the
glove<00:01:45.820> and<00:01:46.060> dry<00:01:46.630> it

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
glove and dry it

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.130 
glove and dry it
there's<00:01:47.079> the<00:01:47.289> 60-degree<00:01:48.189> liner<00:01:48.689> 75<00:01:49.689> degree

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
there's the 60-degree liner 75 degree

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.210 
there's the 60-degree liner 75 degree
liner<00:01:50.380> and

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
liner and

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.120 
liner and
liner<00:01:52.090> so<00:01:52.390> these<00:01:52.570> are<00:01:52.750> all<00:01:52.900> different<00:01:53.650> angles

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
liner so these are all different angles

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.300 
liner so these are all different angles
in<00:01:54.670> which<00:01:55.150> your<00:01:55.360> fingers<00:01:55.810> are<00:01:56.050> oriented<00:01:57.040> in

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
in which your fingers are oriented in

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.010 
in which your fingers are oriented in
the<00:01:57.460> glove<00:01:57.700> and<00:01:57.910> that<00:01:58.030> really<00:01:58.360> changes<00:01:58.840> the

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
the glove and that really changes the

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.770 
the glove and that really changes the
way<00:01:59.050> the<00:01:59.680> glove<00:01:59.920> feels<00:02:00.280> so<00:02:01.000> if<00:02:01.120> you're<00:02:01.360> you're

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
way the glove feels so if you're you're

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.460 
way the glove feels so if you're you're
more<00:02:02.050> used<00:02:02.320> to<00:02:02.470> having<00:02:02.560> a<00:02:03.660> class<00:02:04.660> feeling<00:02:05.140> like

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
more used to having a class feeling like

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.440 
more used to having a class feeling like
this<00:02:05.620> or<00:02:05.920> if<00:02:06.040> you<00:02:06.160> prefer<00:02:06.280> to<00:02:06.550> your<00:02:06.760> my<00:02:06.970> work

this or if you prefer to your my work

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.500 
this or if you prefer to your my work
more<00:02:08.170> of<00:02:08.200> a<00:02:08.350> pinching<00:02:08.860> motion<00:02:08.920> you<00:02:09.910> can<00:02:10.119> adjust

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.510 
more of a pinching motion you can adjust

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.910 
more of a pinching motion you can adjust
the<00:02:10.690> love<00:02:10.960> by<00:02:11.530> swapping<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:12.220> liner<00:02:13.500> we<00:02:14.500> wanted

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
the love by swapping the liner we wanted

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.100 
the love by swapping the liner we wanted
to<00:02:15.070> bring<00:02:15.340> relevant<00:02:15.760> innovation<00:02:16.750> to<00:02:17.080> the
