years<00:03:33.540> sorry<00:03:33.870> a<00:03:33.930> year<00:03:35.870> in<00:03:36.870> this<00:03:37.050> container

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
years sorry a year in this container

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.410 
years sorry a year in this container
what<00:03:40.130> with<00:03:41.130> that<00:03:41.160> power<00:03:41.550> saving<00:03:41.970> sake<00:03:42.120> it<00:03:42.300> is

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
what with that power saving sake it is

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.550 
what with that power saving sake it is
it<00:03:43.380> can<00:03:43.530> go<00:03:43.650> a<00:03:43.680> year<00:03:43.890> without<00:03:44.010> light<00:03:44.430> source

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
it can go a year without light source

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.750 
it can go a year without light source
without<00:03:46.560> power<00:03:46.830> save<00:03:47.070> and<00:03:47.280> with<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.520> power

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
without power save and with the power

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.580 
without power save and with the power
save<00:03:48.090> mode<00:03:48.120> where<00:03:48.570> it<00:03:48.720> will<00:03:48.840> turn<00:03:49.020> off<00:03:49.200> the

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
save mode where it will turn off the

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.199 
save mode where it will turn off the
back<00:03:49.800> lights<00:03:50.100> and<00:03:50.310> so<00:03:50.430> on<00:03:50.459> it<00:03:50.700> can<00:03:50.730> last<00:03:50.940> three

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
back lights and so on it can last three

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.690 
back lights and so on it can last three
years<00:03:51.420> inside<00:03:51.720> of<00:03:51.840> a<00:03:51.900> box<00:03:52.430> but<00:03:53.430> it's<00:03:53.520> got<00:03:53.640> the

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
years inside of a box but it's got the

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.800 
years inside of a box but it's got the
rechargeable<00:03:54.060> battery<00:03:54.150> through<00:03:54.600> the<00:03:54.660> light

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
rechargeable battery through the light

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.630 
rechargeable battery through the light
source<00:03:55.110> mainly<00:03:55.800> sunlight<00:03:56.780> and<00:03:58.580> so<00:03:59.580> I'll

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
source mainly sunlight and so I'll

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.210 
source mainly sunlight and so I'll
figure<00:03:59.790> this<00:03:59.880> to<00:04:00.030> be<00:04:00.090> a<00:04:00.120> great<00:04:00.300> watch<00:04:00.480> to<00:04:00.690> have

figure this to be a great watch to have

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:07.160 
figure this to be a great watch to have
looking<00:04:02.220> forward<00:04:02.400> to<00:04:02.459> g-shock<00:04:02.910> and<00:04:05.600> see<00:04:06.600> it's

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
looking forward to g-shock and see it's

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.140 
looking forward to g-shock and see it's
without<00:04:07.470> focusing<00:04:07.920> sorry<00:04:08.130> guys<00:04:08.370> but<00:04:08.820> look<00:04:08.970> at

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
here you can course you can change it

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.580 
here you can course you can change it
out<00:04:20.669> from<00:04:21.120> understand<00:04:21.660> and<00:04:21.989> then<00:04:22.320> you<00:04:22.440> can

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
out from understand and then you can

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.900 
out from understand and then you can
have<00:04:22.740> this<00:04:23.270> change<00:04:24.270> different<00:04:24.660> ways<00:04:24.780> it's<00:04:25.020> not

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
have this change different ways it's not

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.450 
have this change different ways it's not
232<00:04:26.910> where<00:04:27.150> I'm<00:04:27.270> at<00:04:27.710> it's<00:04:28.710> actually<00:04:29.190> past

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
232 where I'm at it's actually past

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.420 
232 where I'm at it's actually past
midnight<00:04:29.700> so<00:04:29.970> it's<00:04:30.090> probably<00:04:31.040> 12:30<00:04:32.040> to<00:04:32.220> my

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
midnight so it's probably 12:30 to my

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.460 
midnight so it's probably 12:30 to my
time<00:04:32.700> midnight<00:04:34.760> be<00:04:35.760> the<00:04:36.240> way<00:04:36.360> I<00:04:36.390> bet<00:04:37.020> jobs<00:04:37.260> I've

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
time midnight be the way I bet jobs I've

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.500 
time midnight be the way I bet jobs I've
had<00:04:37.500> me<00:04:37.919> being<00:04:38.190> prior<00:04:38.400> military

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
had me being prior military

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.780 
had me being prior military
and<00:04:39.630> a<00:04:39.840> job<00:04:40.020> I<00:04:40.050> have<00:04:40.260> now<00:04:40.440> we<00:04:40.500> use<00:04:40.890> 24-hour<00:04:41.460> time

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
and a job I have now we use 24-hour time

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.140 
and a job I have now we use 24-hour time
so<00:04:42.360> I<00:04:42.390> definitely<00:04:42.540> change<00:04:43.110> that<00:04:43.350> but<00:04:44.000> it<00:04:45.000> isn't

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
so I definitely change that but it isn't

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.880 
so I definitely change that but it isn't
look<00:04:45.360> too<00:04:45.510> big<00:04:45.810> I<00:04:46.080> was<00:04:46.260> kind<00:04:46.440> of<00:04:46.470> worried<00:04:46.740> about

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
look too big I was kind of worried about

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.860 
look too big I was kind of worried about
that<00:04:47.070> a<00:04:47.100> lot<00:04:47.250> of<00:04:47.370> G<00:04:47.520> shocks<00:04:47.760> are<00:04:47.970> really<00:04:48.450> thick

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
that a lot of G shocks are really thick

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.930 
that a lot of G shocks are really thick
and<00:04:49.050> bulky<00:04:49.260> but<00:04:49.680> this<00:04:50.040> is<00:04:50.190> kind<00:04:50.400> of<00:04:50.430> like<00:04:50.550> it's

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
and bulky but this is kind of like it's

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.840 
and bulky but this is kind of like it's
thick<00:04:51.270> no<00:04:51.990> doubt<00:04:52.200> about<00:04:52.320> it

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
thick no doubt about it

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.190 
thick no doubt about it
but<00:04:54.480> I<00:04:54.510> don't<00:04:54.720> think<00:04:54.780> it's<00:04:54.960> going<00:04:55.050> to<00:04:55.110> be

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
but I don't think it's going to be

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.650 
but I don't think it's going to be
really<00:04:55.440> thick<00:04:55.740> I<00:04:56.280> know<00:04:57.030> about<00:04:57.210> a<00:04:57.300> year<00:04:57.390> and<00:04:57.600> a

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
really thick I know about a year and a

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.450 
really thick I know about a year and a
half<00:04:57.750> ago<00:04:57.900> I<00:04:57.990> look<00:04:58.230> at<00:04:58.320> those<00:04:58.440> pathfinders<00:04:59.430> and

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
half ago I look at those pathfinders and

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.820 
half ago I look at those pathfinders and
those<00:04:59.670> things<00:04:59.880> are<00:05:00.030> huge<00:05:00.270> and<00:05:00.510> thick<00:05:00.750> so<00:05:01.080> this

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
those things are huge and thick so this

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.520 
those things are huge and thick so this
is<00:05:02.010> a<00:05:03.410> good<00:05:04.410> median<00:05:05.030> between<00:05:06.290> regular<00:05:07.290> sports

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
is a good median between regular sports

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.590 
is a good median between regular sports
watches<00:05:07.980> and<00:05:08.160> like<00:05:08.280> a<00:05:08.310> pathfinder<00:05:08.580> per<00:05:09.150> se<00:05:09.330> Qi

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
watches and like a pathfinder per se Qi

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.010 
watches and like a pathfinder per se Qi
