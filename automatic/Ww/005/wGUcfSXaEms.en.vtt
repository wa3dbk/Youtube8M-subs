 Hello dear friends with you channel 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.110
 big o today we have a power bank review 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:14.190
 she came to me from china eat about 90 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:17.090
 days for 20 thousand milamperes hours she 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.500
 was cheap and 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:23.910
 20 thousand mA is a lot 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:27.570
 because in my iphone 1500 and sky 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:31.320
 enough 1 8 recharge if not more 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:37.399
 recharge the phone that's 20 thousand 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:42.590
 Milliamper hours here it is not written 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:46.649
 It is written that you can recharge ipad 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:53.570
 smartphones iphone is charging from plug yet 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:56.879
 You can charge a photo video camera and psp 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.699
 we also have an adapter kit 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:04.350
 how is it we postpone nothing else we have 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:09.260
 no adapter one adapter 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:14.850
 from old nokia then micro usb 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:18.750
 standard micro usb mini hdmi and 30 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.390
 pin connector from iphone as she 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.580
 here it looks like it looks here 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.509
 there is a charging indicator it is charged on 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:33.259
 two points of all 4 of them are behind us 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:36.750
 written about her but actually here 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:40.890
 slightly less than 3000 because I charged 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.049
 and the phone once and again I charged one 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.070
 times by 57 percent 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:49.579
 Now I will show how you can charge here 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:55.500
 my watch will charge 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:56.630
 we take insert our wire 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.829
 transition 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:05.399
 here we have 2 yusb flashlight and charging 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:08.710
 it charges from microusb and is inserted 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:14.890
 in the socket so insert visby 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:18.250
 and in our iPod so we look at all charging 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:22.120
 I went now let's see well charging 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:27.670
 goes so if we remove it is clear that he 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:30.550
 principle fully charged in general 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.780
 connects and works here you can see that 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:37.090
 charging you can still charge that is not 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.840
 Only this adapter but you can still 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.490
 charge adapter for example from 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:47.940
 original that is exactly from my 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:51.040
 iPod it will all be charged 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.700
 but guys don't buy this thing i 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:59.370
 paid for it 12 dollars but in practice 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:03.130
 it 's not even 3,000 milliamps that came to me 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:13.420
 very bad and it charges right now I 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:20.320
 I show we turn on micro us we turn on thief in 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:24.760
 normal usb and connect so here 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:30.850
 connect from see that the indicator 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:34.090
 shows that she is charging all that 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:38.400
 was unpacking and first impression of 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:42.420
