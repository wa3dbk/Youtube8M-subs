00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:34.660
 week you get it off the week of enrollment 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:44.530
 with him to see how he can 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:46.300
 The assembly is fine, it's beauty in 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.590
 All the space here for us to do what? 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.220
 the legal regime 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.140
 here he has a bit more of a right finger 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.940
 I do not know a centimeter more or less 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.010
 that belly will increase pt 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.110
 tie the cables back here and there's everything 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.700
 Pretty cool, very pretty way. 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.730
 on the front it looks pretty cool too 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.260
 here you have the power connectors nÃ© do 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.030
 flu were as 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.060
 He was 20 centimeters now I am 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.160
 Seeing it, it's all good here. 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.570
 I think that here in the back there is no 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.200
 A lot of things to say, no, I will. 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:20.170
 come here to show that the back 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.060
 for you here has an expansion 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.579
 who has one more two three four 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.489
 five six seven eight all are eight as 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:30.040
 functions plus one here on the right side here 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.350
 has a fan of 14cm pre 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.739
 installed in the back is more 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.600
 that for a landfill with radiator 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.760
 that few people use but have 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.940
 It's cool too. 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.790
 Let's see that the side of Iraq 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.430
 Look, I only have one here. You're going to open it. 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.980
 a mass- produced franchise can 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.610
 to see well in the detail of the mark is well 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:57.250
 beautiful is a gigantic cover here you 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.940
 install from rain and are not 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.200
 two of 14 and one of 20 and on the side I 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.540
 I think that I think two factors that 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.890
 more interesting here beauty i 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.190
 I'll open the lid as I already had your 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:11.010
 already removed the two screws 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.500
 the right side of the finger screws had 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.220
 those who may not even have the key to 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.420
 this is 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:20.519
 and look just one asked opened the show 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:23.310
 ball looks like the lid is only one 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.210
 kind of another wide one a little 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.640
 but it's so 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:35.190
 david legal battle is going to be well 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:37.770
 easy to do this personal cleaning ok 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.530
 Look at the inner space of this expensive machine. 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.830
 You can do whatever you want in. 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:47.100
 There's a lot of space, even if I go. 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.890
 start here by optical readers and 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.930
 dvd recorder one thing of the sort 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.450
 It's all quiet without faith, it's all without 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.580
 screws just shut your mouth for rifle 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.750
 extra here and one screw is the other 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.700
 side also for a little security 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.590
 greater in transportation we usually 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.900
 put screws in an extra to know 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:07.740
 it will get everything 100% for you to leave 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.120
 home is here we have launched 123456 more 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.340
 one down here that I have an HD 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.530
 before and now it's gone beauty well 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.680
 Our fault, no problem. 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.660
 here inside leaving the corner here you 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.540
 can see here that part is that the 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.160
 two of the hawks of connections 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.510
 max defenders then goes two cars 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.480
 behind him for transfer of 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:31.500
 files and a kid is here to 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:34.050
 energy of both forces thank the 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.970
 show of ball we will see here here behind 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.970
 we have that was 14 centimeters 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:41.610
 pre-installed units that have a molex 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:43.650
 or one of the technology that one of three 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.450
 pins to connect directly to the motherboard 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.370
 Ball show is good to have both options 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:49.380
 You can put the motherboard 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.419
 right here if the motherboard had not 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.310
 already passes behind to hide funk 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:56.490
 A pretty way, right? 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:58.470
 the client chooses the incoming connections 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.330
 document connections that do not have 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:03.060
 a lot of things not to mention have a 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:06.020
 internal USB 3.0 connector that goes 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:08.340
 This motherboard is the best type you have 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.140
 recorded on the board are behind 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.800
 the environment that is kind of ugly let's say 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.240
 like this 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.570
 are all reset button brokers 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:18.820
 power led reset button power button 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:22.090
 the audio and usb 2.0 front 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:24.580
 Yeah, I think I forgot to let it go. 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.890
 thing on top of boot feels good 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.500
 20 centimeters still looking from the 

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:32.830
 down to see you guys so you can 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.820
 see staff in an office well 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.680
 refrigerated 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:37.930
 he has all the structure for you 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.240
 things have gone back to healing in 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.730
 top make big motherboards do is 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:46.240
 to follow another two-fourths of the 

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:48.670
 video supports mono the structure of it is 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.740
 well resistant from the tv catching it is not 

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:52.540
 too heavy is not everything and not much 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:54.790
 heavy but not the structure of their 

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:56.650
 which is very tough and cool even 

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:58.900
 I hope you liked the 

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:01.900
 Week flagship cooler environment 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.440
 master liked the video, it's good here

 leave your comment here below that is 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.920
 too important to take care of 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:11.520
 the nice feedback're worth and to the 

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.520
 next video
