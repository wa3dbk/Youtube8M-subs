store some stuff in here and park the
cars<00:00:31.099> inside<00:00:31.550> since<00:00:32.119> when<00:00:32.390> our<00:00:32.509> garage<00:00:32.780> is

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
cars inside since when our garage is

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.460 
cars inside since when our garage is
used<00:00:33.260> for<00:00:33.500> storing<00:00:33.920> stuff<00:00:34.190> and<00:00:34.520> parking<00:00:35.120> cars

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.470 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.350 

okay<00:00:39.470> when<00:00:40.340> are<00:00:40.489> they<00:00:40.610> kicking<00:00:40.790> us<00:00:41.030> out<00:00:43.360> I'm

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
okay when are they kicking us out I'm

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.400 
okay when are they kicking us out I'm
guessing<00:00:45.200> now<00:00:46.750> maybe<00:00:47.750> we<00:00:47.960> can<00:00:47.990> store

guessing now maybe we can store

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.920 
guessing now maybe we can store
instruments<00:00:49.160> here<00:00:49.460> but<00:00:49.790> we<00:00:50.000> can't<00:00:50.300> practice

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
instruments here but we can't practice

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.080 
instruments here but we can't practice
here<00:00:51.200> we'd<00:00:51.680> be<00:00:51.710> too<00:00:52.010> noisy<00:00:52.160> and<00:00:52.640> the<00:00:52.820> school

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
here we'd be too noisy and the school

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.060 
here we'd be too noisy and the school
wouldn't<00:00:53.390> allow<00:00:53.570> it<00:00:53.600> we<00:00:54.020> need<00:00:54.710> a<00:00:54.740> place<00:00:55.040> that's
