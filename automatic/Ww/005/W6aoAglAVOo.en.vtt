00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.879
 hello girls as I promised them Achilles 

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:07.100
 well get the outline the preparation 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:09.110
 of the previous products of the 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.920
 video so I hope all of you 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.920
 you may like 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.730
 good coquettes this outline is for 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.619
 night so we obviously have to 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.900
 apply a first always to our 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.810
 face and after that I'm going to use 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.419
 this basis that obviously is the brand 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.310
 that I mentioned in the previous video like this 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:33.619
 I'm going to put it with a little brush 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.619
 very pretty all over my face 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.270
 and then what do you expect and very well 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.140
 to take another brochita I'm 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.750
 using this one that is a little bit more 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.150
 more chubby hair and then I'll go 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.210
 blurring all over my face remember 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.280
 also that it is very necessary to apply 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.580
 base also in the part of the area of 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.580
 neck 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.119
 two 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.850
 then we are going to take a first one that 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.700
 It is always a little bit lighter than the 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.130
 basis that we commonly apply and we're going 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.899
 to put there very close to the circles under 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.179
 hide them and also that is going to 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:32.679
 serve to illuminate this at night it 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:32.679
 you will see really fabulous 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.060
 I have two options to apply a powder 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.530
 compact or a translucent powder but 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.080
 you know that I love dust 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.080
 translucent so I'll do it with that 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.450
 and in this way we ratify our 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.450
 face and it will look very natural 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.790
 I'm going to take the bronze now 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.220
 contains illuminator let's take the 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.550
 dark part first and we're going to put it 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.830
 on the sides of the cheeks and 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:34.680
 also in the lower part of the jaw 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.680
 and on the lateral part of the forehead 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.660
 Now let's take the next color 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.569
 that was on the side that was a little 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.450
 more clarito and with the help of a brush 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.819
 like this one we are going to try to blur 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.360
 it's a bit difficult at first 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:54.030
 girls try to make an outline but 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.860
 the secret of truth is to blur and 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.819
 blur so do not despair and 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.819
 let's have a lot of patience 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.900
 as you can see the outline makes 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.120
 that our face looks finer and 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.030
 also highlight in areas that are more 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.190
 beautiful of our face 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.110
 let's move on to do contour too 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.790
 in the part of the nose 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.830
 this is optional if you like it 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.170
 they can do I am doing for 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.660
 prove it and well I always like it 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.690
 do this because you can really feel it 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.810
 much the difference and simply 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:35.940
 we put two lines on the side and 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.940
 we try to blur very well too 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.250
 now let's take the blush this is a 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.890
 orange tone as I commented between 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.370
 orange and coral and we're going to put it in 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.560
 our cheeks but always and girls 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:53.610
 connecting uniting a little bit with the 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.610
 part of the contour 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.090
 I am going to add this chile that also 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.160
 it's for body but how is this 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.920
 makeup for the night because I wanted it 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.870
 do this way and we apply some 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.150
 how many glitters next to it you see 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.130
 incredible for the night 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.560
 now girls to accompany this look and 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:31.100
 it does not stay like this only with contour 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.950
 I'm going to outline my eyebrows and I'm 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.810
 doing with a shady mattek 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:39.070
 just filling in some some 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.070
 imperfections of them 

00:04:53.439 --> 00:05:00.710
 to get a better definition let's go 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:03.289
 to damage below with a concealer and 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:06.370
 this will make them look much prettier 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:06.370
 and also highlight 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.389
 yes 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:38.250
 as you know my eyebrows are super 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:41.260
 populated so I'm applying a 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:45.270
 fixing liquid in them so that they 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.270
 keep always intact 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:49.940
 Now I'm going to take this mask 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:53.510
 eyelashes that honestly has me 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:56.060
 fascinated girls really have the 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:59.030
 super super thin brochita and 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:01.610
 elongated much much lashes like 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:04.760
 you can observe and it is easy to 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:07.280
 apply and with that that bit too 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:10.120
 It is very simple the application for 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.120
 lower lashes 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:28.210
 and to finish our outline also 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:31.150
 I 'll accompany it with a lipstick 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:34.920
 this is a gloss orange tree is the 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.920
 brand knicks is a soft 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.220
 and when girls like that ends our 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.990
 outline for night I hope you have them 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.810
 liked and also that has served them 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:49.150
