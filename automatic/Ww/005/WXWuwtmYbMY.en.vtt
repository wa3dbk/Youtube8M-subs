00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.260
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.059
 another video from the commander prosit 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.580
 we finally have black ops 2 as well 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.800
 I already explained that before 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.390
 weapons and the new perks from black ops 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:24.480
 two things very much 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:29.789
 I hope you again with me 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.640
 I know I am even a comparison with 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.260
 the definitely 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.399
 I hope you like the video though 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.469
 I have a bit I wanted me 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.570
 first explain 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:43.829
 some criticize yes black ops but I 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.600
 must with criticism to triple make no 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.340
 real bustle but just three 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.540
 faster in a row and for that 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:58.310
 fen 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:01:03.290
 okay it was ok sector in any case 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:04.930
 I think the sniper so the gsr 50 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.020
 if I am not wrong 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.870
 So she is called 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.130
 disappointed 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.530
 Yes 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.600
 I would highly recommend with which 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.570
 on 16 I play magazine extension 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.539
 and ballistics processor quite well 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.670
 Towels are well made for the weapon and 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:26.659
 then player with the ballista 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.750
 zoom and vollmann bullet that one stops 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.039
 not catch 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:35.060
 So I hope you have one now 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:40.159
 little grenade launcher styler on everyone 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:46.099
 case is always different because just 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:50.500
 series sniper different anyway 

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:50.500
 yet each time different for each 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.509
 Properties kiss like that where actually 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.470
 but I'm fine with that 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:06.230
 my game stays there online 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.649
 He has been my team playing with 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:18.590
 Sensitivity 1 runs then looks this 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:21.650
 I have half an hour to compete 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.340
 music so you can see that the 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.450
 but only the boards are send 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.390
 scan the team of black ops 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.239
 the computer - controlled overdue ca 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.590
 every shot first it comes to everyone 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:38.640
 case that waving in the boards 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.260
 Setting the story as bad or 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.860
 Well, now the beats are done 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.950
 mission may be the most beautiful 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.129
 ok 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.090
 I'm not the best now, yes 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:54.050
 okay that is already 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.660
 I hope I could do a bit 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.150
 what explain if you liked then 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.580
 could perhaps be looked criticism because 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.890
 the camera in front of us improve in the video 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.950
 or you can like us if 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:10.150
 yes , an abo and water has fallen 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.150
