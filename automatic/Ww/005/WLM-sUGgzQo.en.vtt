00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
will definitely understand that it's

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.520 
will definitely understand that it's
really<00:02:25.180> difficult<00:02:25.450> to<00:02:25.750> be<00:02:25.960> behind<00:02:26.380> the<00:02:26.500> camera

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
really difficult to be behind the camera

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.470 
really difficult to be behind the camera
and<00:02:26.980> in<00:02:27.430> front<00:02:27.670> of<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:27.790> camera<00:02:28.120> at<00:02:28.210> the<00:02:28.270> same

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
and in front of the camera at the same

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.630 
and in front of the camera at the same
time<00:02:28.720> and<00:02:29.200> that's<00:02:29.380> what<00:02:29.710> makes<00:02:29.920> it<00:02:30.070> such<00:02:30.310> like

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
time and that's what makes it such like

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.100 
time and that's what makes it such like
I<00:02:30.910> guess<00:02:31.680> tedious<00:02:32.680> hard<00:02:33.340> work<00:02:33.840> it's<00:02:34.840> because

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
I guess tedious hard work it's because

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.180 
I guess tedious hard work it's because
you're<00:02:35.260> doing<00:02:35.710> like<00:02:35.980> a<00:02:37.170> normal<00:02:38.170> like<00:02:38.500> film

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
you're doing like a normal like film

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.000 
you're doing like a normal like film
style<00:02:40.180> stuff<00:02:40.480> you<00:02:40.630> have<00:02:40.780> like<00:02:41.010> directors

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
style stuff you have like directors

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.730 
style stuff you have like directors
editors<00:02:42.370> and<00:02:43.300> like<00:02:43.450> writers<00:02:43.990> and<00:02:44.320> everything

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
editors and like writers and everything

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.490 
editors and like writers and everything
but<00:02:45.040> as<00:02:45.220> like<00:02:45.520> youtubers<00:02:46.120> like<00:02:46.180> most<00:02:47.170> people

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
but as like youtubers like most people

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.680 
but as like youtubers like most people
do<00:02:47.710> everything<00:02:48.520> they<00:02:48.760> edit<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.210> video<00:02:49.480> they

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
do everything they edit the video they

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.330 
do everything they edit the video they
shoot<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:50.110> video<00:02:50.380> they<00:02:50.620> write<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:51.070> video

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
shoot the video they write the video

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.180 
shoot the video they write the video
they<00:02:51.790> act<00:02:52.060> I<00:02:52.420> mean<00:02:53.200> they<00:02:53.320> do<00:02:53.380> everything<00:02:53.800> and

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
they act I mean they do everything and

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.690 
they act I mean they do everything and
so<00:02:54.400> it<00:02:55.120> does<00:02:55.590> get<00:02:56.590> to<00:02:56.740> be<00:02:56.890> a<00:02:56.920> lot<00:02:57.160> of<00:02:57.250> work<00:02:57.400> and

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
so it does get to be a lot of work and

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.270 
so it does get to be a lot of work and
it<00:02:58.330> is<00:02:58.480> like<00:02:58.750> pretty<00:02:59.320> tiring<00:03:00.750> and<00:03:01.950> I<00:03:02.950> know<00:03:03.040> it's

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
it is like pretty tiring and I know it's

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.270 
it is like pretty tiring and I know it's
just<00:03:03.370> like<00:03:03.550> I<00:03:04.140> really<00:03:05.140> want<00:03:05.320> to<00:03:05.410> do<00:03:05.530> it<00:03:05.710> but<00:03:06.220> I

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
just like I really want to do it but I

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.979 
just like I really want to do it but I
don't<00:03:06.550> have<00:03:06.670> the<00:03:06.820> energy<00:03:06.850> to<00:03:07.270> do<00:03:07.570> it<00:03:07.600> the<00:03:07.870> way<00:03:07.959> I

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
don't have the energy to do it the way I

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:13.220 
don't have the energy to do it the way I
want<00:03:08.350> to<00:03:08.440> do<00:03:08.530> it<00:03:08.650> right<00:03:08.830> now<00:03:10.260> so<00:03:11.550> that<00:03:12.550> sucks

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
want to do it right now so that sucks

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.920 
want to do it right now so that sucks
but<00:03:14.230> I<00:03:14.530> guess<00:03:15.340> what<00:03:15.820> this<00:03:15.940> means<00:03:16.239> is<00:03:16.510> I<00:03:16.750> have

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
but I guess what this means is I have

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.449 
but I guess what this means is I have
more<00:03:17.110> time<00:03:17.380> to<00:03:17.739> work<00:03:18.489> on<00:03:19.230> uh<00:03:20.230> what<00:03:21.010> exactly<00:03:21.130> I

swifty<00:03:38.950> style<00:03:39.430> stuff<00:03:39.700> because<00:03:40.090> I'm<00:03:40.989> not<00:03:41.350> done

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
swifty style stuff because I'm not done

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.320 
swifty style stuff because I'm not done
with<00:03:41.680> a<00:03:41.950> swifty<00:03:42.520> I<00:03:42.550> know<00:03:42.700> it's<00:03:42.880> been<00:03:43.060> a<00:03:43.090> while

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
with a swifty I know it's been a while

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.390 
with a swifty I know it's been a while
but<00:03:43.870> this<00:03:43.959> is<00:03:44.020> normally<00:03:44.470> what<00:03:44.620> I<00:03:44.650> do<00:03:44.770> if<00:03:45.220> you

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
but this is normally what I do if you

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.920 
but this is normally what I do if you
will<00:03:45.489> actually<00:03:45.910> go<00:03:46.060> back<00:03:46.180> and<00:03:46.390> look<00:03:46.540> at<00:03:46.870> all

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
will actually go back and look at all

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.210 
will actually go back and look at all
the<00:03:47.260> seasons<00:03:47.709> of<00:03:47.890> it<00:03:48.040> I<00:03:48.220> do<00:03:49.200> tin<00:03:50.200> the<00:03:50.440> like<00:03:50.769> 15

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
the seasons of it I do tin the like 15

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.949 
the seasons of it I do tin the like 15
episodes<00:03:51.730> and<00:03:51.910> then<00:03:52.060> I<00:03:52.120> just<00:03:52.330> let<00:03:52.600> it<00:03:52.720> ride<00:03:52.900> for

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
episodes and then I just let it ride for

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.810 
episodes and then I just let it ride for
a<00:03:53.200> little<00:03:53.320> while<00:03:53.500> and<00:03:54.040> I<00:03:54.880> mean<00:03:55.090> it<00:03:55.840> is<00:03:56.820> july

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
a little while and I mean it is july

a little while and I mean it is july
right<00:03:58.150> now<00:03:58.330> so<00:03:59.190> i'm<00:04:00.190> guessing<00:04:00.519> i'll<00:04:01.450> get

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
right now so i'm guessing i'll get

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.040

ten episodes before i'm done with this
season<00:04:08.050> and<00:04:08.230> then<00:04:08.769> on<00:04:08.950> 2013

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590

that's<00:05:30.090> like<00:05:30.300> acceptable<00:05:30.930> on<00:05:31.080> the<00:05:31.200> sofa<00:05:31.440> racha

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
that's like acceptable on the sofa racha

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.190 
that's like acceptable on the sofa racha
channel<00:05:32.389> because<00:05:33.389> everybody<00:05:33.750> wants<00:05:33.870> it<00:05:34.080> to<00:05:34.169> be

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
channel because everybody wants it to be

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.529 
channel because everybody wants it to be
like<00:05:34.560> random<00:05:35.460> comedy<00:05:35.940> and<00:05:36.210> then<00:05:36.240> I<00:05:36.360> thought

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 
like random comedy and then I thought

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:38.960 
like random comedy and then I thought
that<00:05:36.750> but<00:05:37.080> at<00:05:37.200> the<00:05:37.289> same<00:05:37.470> time<00:05:37.650> like<00:05:37.950> you<00:05:38.849> know

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
that but at the same time like you know

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:40.940 
that but at the same time like you know
if<00:05:39.270> that's<00:05:39.750> what<00:05:39.930> you<00:05:40.050> want<00:05:40.260> it<00:05:40.320> to<00:05:40.440> be<00:05:40.620> then

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950 
if that's what you want it to be then

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:42.950 
if that's what you want it to be then
there's<00:05:41.130> going<00:05:41.340> to<00:05:41.580> be<00:05:41.610> no<00:05:41.910> content<00:05:42.510> for<00:05:42.900> a

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
there's going to be no content for a

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.180 
there's going to be no content for a
while<00:05:43.200> and<00:05:43.500> that's<00:05:43.620> what's<00:05:43.860> like<00:05:44.039> so

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
while and that's what's like so

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.860 
while and that's what's like so
ultimately<00:05:44.430> I<00:05:44.639> could<00:05:44.880> be<00:05:45.000> doing<00:05:45.150> all<00:05:45.450> types<00:05:45.479> of

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
ultimately I could be doing all types of

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.500 
ultimately I could be doing all types of
stuff<00:05:45.930> on<00:05:46.289> the<00:05:46.500> channel<00:05:46.889> and<00:05:47.150> I'm<00:05:48.150> just<00:05:48.330> not

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
stuff on the channel and I'm just not

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:49.820 
stuff on the channel and I'm just not
because<00:05:48.900> I<00:05:48.990> feel<00:05:49.169> like<00:05:49.229> it's<00:05:49.410> not<00:05:49.560> appropriate

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
because I feel like it's not appropriate

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.890 
because I feel like it's not appropriate
there<00:05:50.310> but<00:05:50.849> I<00:05:50.880> feel<00:05:51.419> like<00:05:51.450> that's<00:05:51.660> the

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
there but I feel like that's the

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.500 
there but I feel like that's the
mentality<00:05:52.080> I<00:05:52.530> have<00:05:52.680> to<00:05:52.770> change<00:05:53.039> because<00:05:53.460> it<00:05:53.849> is

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
mentality I have to change because it is
