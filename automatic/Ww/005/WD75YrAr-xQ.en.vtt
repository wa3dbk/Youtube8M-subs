00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.600 
bamboo around also I can change the size
of<00:02:08.360> my<00:02:08.780> radical<00:02:09.110> so<00:02:09.590> you<00:02:09.649> can<00:02:09.860> see<00:02:10.039> as<00:02:10.130> larger

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
of my radical so you can see as larger

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.600 
of my radical so you can see as larger
or<00:02:10.789> I<00:02:10.820> can<00:02:11.420> make<00:02:11.450> it<00:02:11.660> much<00:02:11.780> smaller<00:02:12.459> you<00:02:13.459> can

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
or I can make it much smaller you can

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.540 
or I can make it much smaller you can
see<00:02:14.080> I'm<00:02:15.080> going<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.350> make<00:02:15.470> it<00:02:15.620> pretty<00:02:15.890> big<00:02:16.040> and

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
see I'm going to make it pretty big and

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.400 
see I'm going to make it pretty big and
I<00:02:16.640> can<00:02:16.790> also<00:02:16.940> change<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.360> density<00:02:17.630> so<00:02:18.350> you

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
I can also change the density so you

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.110 
I can also change the density so you
notice<00:02:18.709> whenever<00:02:18.920> I<00:02:19.100> drop<00:02:19.370> it<00:02:19.550> in<00:02:19.640> you<00:02:19.760> can<00:02:19.910> see

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
notice whenever I drop it in you can see

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.360 
notice whenever I drop it in you can see
how<00:02:20.270> it<00:02:20.420> drops<00:02:20.930> all<00:02:21.260> the<00:02:21.290> grass<00:02:21.650> into<00:02:21.920> my<00:02:22.130> scene

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
how it drops all the grass into my scene

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.810 
how it drops all the grass into my scene
but<00:02:22.880> I<00:02:22.940> can<00:02:23.090> even<00:02:23.239> make<00:02:23.450> it<00:02:23.630> more<00:02:23.780> dense<00:02:24.080> and

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
but I can even make it more dense and

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.759 
but I can even make it more dense and
then<00:02:25.820> whenever<00:02:25.970> I<00:02:26.180> click<00:02:29.290> wow<00:02:30.290> that's<00:02:30.560> a<00:02:30.650> lot

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
then whenever I click wow that's a lot

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.740 
then whenever I click wow that's a lot
of<00:02:30.800> grass<00:02:31.130> so<00:02:31.370> let's<00:02:31.640> get<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:31.910> more<00:02:32.180> and<00:02:32.420> we

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
of grass so let's get the more and we

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:47.290 
of grass so let's get the more and we
can<00:02:32.930> mow<00:02:33.080> away<00:02:33.320> the<00:02:33.500> grass

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.150 

next<00:02:48.300> let's<00:02:48.480> add<00:02:48.630> in<00:02:48.810> more<00:02:48.840> blocks<00:02:49.319> let's<00:02:50.010> go

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
next let's add in more blocks let's go

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.949 
next let's add in more blocks let's go
to<00:02:50.220> 3d<00:02:50.520> blocks<00:02:50.849> and<00:02:51.150> let's<00:02:51.300> add<00:02:51.450> in<00:02:51.660> a<00:02:51.750> box

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
to 3d blocks and let's add in a box

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.760 
to 3d blocks and let's add in a box
let's<00:02:52.739> just<00:02:52.950> add<00:02:53.130> in<00:02:53.310> box<00:02:53.550> 003<00:02:54.590> once<00:02:55.590> we've

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
let's just add in box 003 once we've

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.589 
let's just add in box 003 once we've
added<00:02:55.950> in<00:02:56.160> our<00:02:56.280> box<00:02:56.520> we<00:02:56.970> want<00:02:57.150> to<00:02:57.239> add<00:02:57.330> in<00:02:57.510> a

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
added in our box we want to add in a

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.390 
added in our box we want to add in a
texture<00:02:57.989> to<00:02:58.110> make<00:02:58.230> it<00:02:58.350> look<00:02:58.500> nicer<00:02:58.920> maybe<00:02:59.220> like

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
texture to make it look nicer maybe like

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.949 
texture to make it look nicer maybe like
a<00:02:59.459> concrete<00:03:00.000> box<00:03:00.150> or<00:03:00.420> something<00:03:00.540> but

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
a concrete box or something but

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.900 
a concrete box or something but
currently<00:03:01.290> is<00:03:01.500> now<00:03:01.709> this<00:03:01.920> just<00:03:02.100> plain<00:03:02.400> whitish

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
currently is now this just plain whitish

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.350 
currently is now this just plain whitish
gray<00:03:03.180> box<00:03:03.680> if<00:03:04.680> we<00:03:04.890> go<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.190> modify<00:03:05.459> panel<00:03:05.610> we

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
gray box if we go to the modify panel we

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.729 
gray box if we go to the modify panel we
can<00:03:06.480> go<00:03:06.569> to<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.810> material<00:03:06.959> and<00:03:07.350> texture

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
can go to the material and texture

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.309 
can go to the material and texture
settings<00:03:08.150> here<00:03:09.150> we<00:03:09.360> can<00:03:09.480> add<00:03:09.510> in<00:03:09.840> diffuse

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
settings here we can add in diffuse

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.530 
settings here we can add in diffuse
opacity<00:03:11.099> vault<00:03:11.400> specular<00:03:12.090> glow<00:03:12.390> or

reflection map there will be a tutorial

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.580 
reflection map there will be a tutorial
that<00:03:15.120> dives<00:03:15.450> deeper<00:03:15.840> into<00:03:16.050> each<00:03:16.170> one<00:03:16.350> of<00:03:16.410> these

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
that dives deeper into each one of these

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.680 
that dives deeper into each one of these
channels<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.400> explain<00:03:17.760> more<00:03:17.970> in<00:03:18.090> depth<00:03:18.330> how<00:03:18.630> to

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
channels to explain more in depth how to

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.900 
channels to explain more in depth how to
use<00:03:19.080> these<00:03:19.260> material<00:03:19.769> channels<00:03:20.100> but<00:03:20.519> for<00:03:20.760> me

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
use these material channels but for me

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.640 
use these material channels but for me
what<00:03:21.239> I'm<00:03:21.330> going<00:03:21.569> to<00:03:21.600> do<00:03:21.750> is<00:03:21.900> we<00:03:22.140> can<00:03:22.319> just<00:03:22.440> load

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
what I'm going to do is we can just load

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
what I'm going to do is we can just load
into<00:03:22.890> material<00:03:25.040> so<00:03:26.040> we<00:03:26.160> can<00:03:26.280> just<00:03:26.340> grab<00:03:26.610> a

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
into material so we can just grab a

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.490 
into material so we can just grab a
material<00:03:27.180> double<00:03:27.569> click<00:03:27.690> and<00:03:27.900> now<00:03:28.140> it's<00:03:28.380> a

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
material double click and now it's a

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.520 
material double click and now it's a
concrete<00:03:28.920> box<00:03:29.930> next<00:03:30.930> I<00:03:31.080> want<00:03:31.170> to<00:03:31.290> show<00:03:31.410> you<00:03:31.470> how

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
concrete box next I want to show you how

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.650 
concrete box next I want to show you how
we<00:03:31.590> can<00:03:31.799> attach<00:03:32.040> props<00:03:32.400> to<00:03:32.700> other<00:03:32.850> props<00:03:33.180> so

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
we can attach props to other props so

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.240 
we can attach props to other props so
I'm<00:03:33.720> just<00:03:33.900> going<00:03:34.049> to<00:03:34.170> grab<00:03:34.260> in<00:03:34.530> another<00:03:34.890> prob

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
I'm just going to grab in another prob

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.770 
I'm just going to grab in another prob
like<00:03:35.910> this<00:03:36.090> box<00:03:36.330> 004<00:03:38.180> and<00:03:39.180> notice<00:03:39.450> it<00:03:39.569> still

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
like this box 004 and notice it still

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.360 
like this box 004 and notice it still
has<00:03:39.900> that<00:03:39.930> white<00:03:40.290> texture<00:03:40.739> so<00:03:41.010> again<00:03:41.250> I'm

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
has that white texture so again I'm

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.890 
has that white texture so again I'm
going<00:03:41.459> to<00:03:41.519> open<00:03:41.640> up<00:03:41.819> my<00:03:41.970> external<00:03:42.420> textures

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
going to open up my external textures

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.229 
going to open up my external textures
just<00:03:43.350> grab<00:03:43.590> a<00:03:43.709> texture<00:03:44.130> and<00:03:44.310> just<00:03:45.030> drag<00:03:45.180> and

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
just grab a texture and just drag and

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.099 
just grab a texture and just drag and
drop<00:03:45.420> it<00:03:45.569> onto<00:03:45.810> my<00:03:45.959> prop<00:03:47.660> next<00:03:48.660> I'm<00:03:48.810> going<00:03:48.840> to

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
drop it onto my prop next I'm going to

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.069 
drop it onto my prop next I'm going to
attach<00:03:49.470> this<00:03:49.859> prop<00:03:50.250> to<00:03:50.609> this<00:03:50.820> prop<00:03:51.090> to<00:03:51.660> do<00:03:51.810> so

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
attach this prop to this prop to do so

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.720 
attach this prop to this prop to do so
make<00:03:52.440> sure<00:03:52.470> you<00:03:52.680> have<00:03:52.799> that<00:03:52.950> prop<00:03:53.220> selected

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
make sure you have that prop selected

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.880 
make sure you have that prop selected
then<00:03:54.090> go<00:03:54.239> to<00:03:54.299> the<00:03:54.420> modify<00:03:54.720> panel<00:03:54.870> click<00:03:55.650> on<00:03:55.769> the

section menu and then go to attach then
we<00:03:59.010> can<00:03:59.190> attach<00:03:59.430> that<00:03:59.640> box<00:03:59.910> to<00:04:00.329> the<00:04:00.420> other<00:04:00.570> box

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
we can attach that box to the other box

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.479 
we can attach that box to the other box
by<00:04:01.019> clicking<00:04:01.049> long<00:04:01.560> parent<00:04:01.920> and<00:04:02.070> then
