00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hola que tal Today we will learn to 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.840
 make this card with cake or also 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.060
 known as an explosive card 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.250
 we are going to need cardboard of the color of 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.160
 your preference to make the box that 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.770
 measure 30 centimeters by 30 centimeters 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.710
 wide and we're going to make marks at 10 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.130
 centimeters and we should be 9 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.529
 squares 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.509
 and we are going to make diagonals in 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:28.029
 squares of the corners and then 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:30.430
 let's mark well all the lines that 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.320
 we have drawn you can help you from a 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.739
 pen without ink or with the edge of the 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.739
 scissors 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.010
 since we finished marking all the 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.260
 lines in the diagonal lines of the 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.200
 chopsticks of the corners we are going to mark 3 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.440
 centimeters in each and from this point 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.490
 let's join the center square 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.530
 as we appreciate in the video 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.300
 we will do in each of the 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.579
 corners 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.120
 At the end we should be this figure 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.890
 we are going to cut it and with an eraser 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.460
 we remove all the pencil marks that 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.460
 we have done 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.890
 once we remove them we start 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.890
 Bend 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.680
 and this little house is going to close in this way 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.780
 now we go with the cover for this we go 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.750
 to need a cardboard box of 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.630
 20 centimeters x 20 centimeters wide 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.690
 and we are going to mark the 4 points 5 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.540
 centimeters from the corner inwards 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.500
 in all the corners and we are going to join the 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.510
 lines staying like this 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.900
 we also mark all the lines that 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.900
 we did 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.360
 and we are going to remember one of those lines of 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.700
 the squares that remained external without 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.860
 pass it these will form the eyelashes 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.770
 that will help us to build our 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.140
 we'll do it in the four 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.720
 corners we erase all the marks of 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.400
 pencil and we're going to start doubling since 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.530
 all the lines have been marked we are going to 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.229
 start to build the capital on the 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.750
 little tab we put glue on bar and 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.670
 we are arming in this way and the same 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:18.370
 with all the other tabs we doubled 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.370
 we put glue and paste 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.670
 ready we have our cap and the 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.900
 you can decorate the box as you want 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.360
 to close in this way 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.180
 Now let's make the cake and for that 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.650
 we're going to need 86 circles 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.319
 centimeters and 4 centimeters 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.439
 respectively we are also going to do 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.750
 rectangles strips of 2 centimeters and 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:41.609
 2.5 centimeters for the circle more 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.739
 big make sure they are what 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:45.580
 long enough to cover 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.100
 the circles 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.530
 let's put silicone around everything 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.410
 the circle and very carefully we are going to 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.290
 go hitting the corresponding strips 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.210
 to each one remember that the band-aid of 2.5 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.610
 centimeters wide is for the circle 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.950
 bigger once you finish it 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.370
 paste around the entire circle removes 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.370
 excess 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.670
 you can also make them from cardboard 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.010
 white to make it easier and no longer 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.200
 you have to line it and the cake will be 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.490
 formed in this way a circle up 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.130
 of other 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.560
 I decided to decorate and put cake 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.150
 some flowers and I'm going to do 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.780
 perforations to go putting the 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.850
 little flowers 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.990
 first in the smallest circle that 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.030
 I'm going to put it up 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.880
 and I'm also going to put holes in the 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.280
 side to put flowers also 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.260
 on one side the excess of the stick 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.750
 of the flower can cut it or 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.090
 you can just roll it up, have a lot 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.460
 Be careful when drilling if you 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.920
 you prefer you can use a pencil to 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.880
 make coral holes or like you 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.400
 you want the cake 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.140
 I also put pearls around him 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.350
 each of the levels of the cake 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.780
 I also used a ribbon at the level 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.580
 from the center and at the last level 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.590
 I only put flowers in the part 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.720
 from above and once you have decorated 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.080
 all levels start to build your 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.080
 cake 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.090
 for the cap I just put a 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.090
 ribbon to decorate 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:20.829
 in the box from the inside 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:23.440
 I only put squares on each side and 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:26.760
 to the center I put a circle of 9 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.760
 centimeters in diameter 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:34.310
 then use cold silicone to stick 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:37.639
 the cake to the card we focus it very 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.440
 well and we press to dry and now 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:43.360
 your card is ready you can decorate it 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.360
 on the sides as you wish 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.170
 we're going to close it by taking three sides 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.950
 of the box and with the cap we are going to 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:53.740
 raise the room and we are going to close 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:56.100
 when there will be surprise there is the 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.100
 cake 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.909
 at the end only put this decoration to 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.560
 the sides of the box I hope the video
