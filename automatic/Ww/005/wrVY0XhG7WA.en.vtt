00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.529
 which happened to kids here with ky 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:07.240
 good how good are we going to analyze in 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:09.460
 first place to philippe coutinho a 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.590
 surprising player the truth and good 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.809
 this player has been promoted in five 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.900
 points the rhythm and 8 the dribble with 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:18.550
 respect to fifa 12 until having 90 of 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.980
 pace and be one of the players with more 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.020
 Dodge of the game surprise of the truth 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.849
 plays in the mc position or so 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.980
 despite a good pass but instead has 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.869
 a bad shot which is the only point in 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.789
 against this great player as 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.100
 we see this player was silver over 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.350
 12 and had two versions of silver one of the 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.000
 inter and another transferred in Spanish and 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.309
 he even had a black letter from this 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.760
 club in Spanish for its great performance a 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.760
 match 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.220
 the next player paul pogba player 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.380
 French of the juventus of turin la 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.060
 truth is that this player in the fifa 13 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.920
 I was disappointed because although he has 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.810
 raised a general average point and passes 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.760
 bronze being silver does not have a 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.070
 stats as revolutionary as I had in 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.690
 fifa 12 but that does have a rhythm of 75 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.720
 quite acceptable to be midfielder 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.410
 defensive had three cards one to the united 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.540
 with 65 rhythm and another version up with 79 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.820
 rhythm was also a player transferred 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.320
 to juventus at the end of fifa 12 as 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.140
 curiosity must be said that this 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.420
 player was very expensive at the beginning of the 12th and 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.060
 passing the time or lowering its price 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.860
 but still right now it's worth 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.250
 100,000 coins that for a player of 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.620
 bronze is quite expensive the truth 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.300
 last one of the players that 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.950
 personally I liked the most 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.960
 figure 12 and with the states that will have 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.440
 in fifa 13 it looks like it's going to be even 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.390
 best 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.310
 well in depth we see that this 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.110
 crack is going to have 90 rhythm and if god 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.330
 wants 4 dribble star that I believe 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.200
 that he deserves besides he will have a good shot 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.360
 and an interesting step 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.939
 this player was one of the fifa 12 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.939
 that had more letters up to 6 cards 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.350
 if we make memory he had a letter of 79 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.550
 not bright later a black letter 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.440
 of 81 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.240
 subsequently it was letter up with a 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.970
 bright letter identical to the previous 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.000
 Black letter returned to have another letter 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.720
 black of 83 and was totti of the bundesliga 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.820
 with a spectacular 88 average for 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.070
 finish increasing a point in your 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.650
 normal letter and was a transfer player 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.410
 to borussia this player as I have 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.180
 said is one of the fifa cracks 12 and 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.680
 Well, you've already remembered that the medias do not 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.090
 they are safe but the most likely and 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.950
 also thank you over on your side 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.480
 see for letting me place the different 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.250
 letters since it's an idea of ​​yours that good 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.900
 I asked her permission so she would not get upset 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.520
 ok good kids
