make a nether portal without using a

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.670 
make a nether portal without using a
dime<00:00:15.000> Poquette<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.599> get<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.049> obsidian<00:00:16.470> from

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
dime Poquette to get the obsidian from

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.990 
dime Poquette to get the obsidian from
the<00:00:17.119> wherever<00:00:18.119> you<00:00:18.270> go<00:00:18.949> okay<00:00:19.949> you<00:00:20.340> start<00:00:20.820> by

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
the wherever you go okay you start by

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.910 
the wherever you go okay you start by
well<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:22.199> don't<00:00:22.380> really<00:00:22.410> need<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.769> make<00:00:22.890> a

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
well you don't really need to make a

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.019 
well you don't really need to make a
friend<00:00:23.189> like<00:00:23.279> this<00:00:23.430> but<00:00:23.550> you<00:00:23.670> need<00:00:23.850> to

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
friend like this but you need to

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.259 
friend like this but you need to
basically<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:25.199> way<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:26.130> obsidian<00:00:26.609> is<00:00:26.910> made

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
basically the way the obsidian is made

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.780 
basically the way the obsidian is made
is<00:00:28.019> if<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.099> get<00:00:31.309> flowing<00:00:32.309> water<00:00:32.520> like<00:00:32.759> this

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
is if you get flowing water like this

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.889 
is if you get flowing water like this
but<00:00:33.270> just<00:00:34.260> like<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.969> then<00:00:35.969> put<00:00:36.420> love<00:00:36.600> in<00:00:36.809> the

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
but just like that then put love in the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.619 
but just like that then put love in the
bog<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.320> turns<00:00:37.530> straight<00:00:37.739> obsidian<00:00:38.250> or<00:00:38.510> if<00:00:39.510> you

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
bog it turns straight obsidian or if you

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.440 
bog it turns straight obsidian or if you
have<00:00:39.780> lava<00:00:40.590> like<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.579> pour<00:00:41.850> flowing

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
have lava like that and you pour flowing

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:52.540 
have lava like that and you pour flowing
upon<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:42.930> then<00:00:46.700> so<00:00:47.700> if<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.850> had<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:48.000> big<00:00:48.180> long

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:01:02.090 

like<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.930> and<00:01:00.379> you<00:01:01.379> got<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.590> bucket<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:01.980> water

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
like that and you got a bucket of water

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.500 
like that and you got a bucket of water
you<00:01:02.309> just<00:01:02.340> pull<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.760> over<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.239> returns

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
you just pull it over it it returns

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.120 
you just pull it over it it returns
obsidian<00:01:03.989> see<00:01:04.170> there<00:01:04.799> we<00:01:04.979> go<00:01:05.270> so<00:01:06.270> if<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.479> pour

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
obsidian see there we go so if you pour

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.700 
obsidian see there we go so if you pour
water<00:01:08.390> flying<00:01:09.390> obsidian<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:09.990> just<00:01:10.170> makes<00:01:10.380> I

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
water flying obsidian it just makes I

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.620 
water flying obsidian it just makes I
mean<00:01:11.010> people<00:01:11.310> water<00:01:11.670> flowing<00:01:12.060> our<00:01:12.299> bed<00:01:12.479> and

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
mean people water flowing our bed and

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.969 
mean people water flowing our bed and
make<00:01:12.750> something<00:01:12.930> else<00:01:13.140> but<00:01:13.680> if<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.830> just

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
make something else but if you just

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.620 
make something else but if you just
bought<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.369> flowing<00:01:14.790> if<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.270> thought<00:01:15.479> was

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
bought and flowing if you thought was

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.289 
bought and flowing if you thought was
still<00:01:15.930> love<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.320> then<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.619> should<00:01:16.799> make

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
still love it then it should make

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.080 
still love it then it should make
obsidian<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.590> use<00:01:20.009> frames<00:01:20.610> like<00:01:20.820> this

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
obsidian so I use frames like this

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.070 
obsidian so I use frames like this
because<00:01:22.280> it's<00:01:23.280> well<00:01:24.030> basically<00:01:24.270> because<00:01:24.780> the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
because it's well basically because the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.899 
because it's well basically because the
way<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.560> make<00:01:25.740> them<00:01:25.979> like<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.130> it's

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
way that you make them like that it's

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.660 
way that you make them like that it's
you<00:01:27.659> make<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.869> mold<00:01:28.229> for<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.860> then<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.460> sort

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
you make a mold for it and then you sort

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.330 
you make a mold for it and then you sort
up<00:01:29.850> place<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.090> all<00:01:30.329> along<00:01:31.009> so<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.100> need<00:01:32.250> to

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
up place it all along so you need to

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.170 
up place it all along so you need to
start<00:01:32.610> with<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:33.150> lot<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.950> lava<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.460> water<00:01:35.909> I

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
start with a lot of lava and water I

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.210 
start with a lot of lava and water I
mean<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.450> can<00:01:36.570> just<00:01:36.630> make<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.890> you<00:01:37.890> can<00:01:38.040> just

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
mean you can just make a you can just

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.170 
mean you can just make a you can just
make<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:39.619> everlasting<00:01:40.619> pool<00:01:40.829> by<00:01:41.189> doing

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
make and everlasting pool by doing

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.210 
make and everlasting pool by doing
Square<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.900> putting<00:01:43.260> water<00:01:43.470> in<00:01:43.860> each<00:01:44.010> corner

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
Square and putting water in each corner

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.370 
Square and putting water in each corner
and<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.640> will<00:01:44.760> become<00:01:44.940> our<00:01:45.420> last<00:01:45.990> pool<00:01:46.230> you<00:01:46.320> can

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
and it will become our last pool you can

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:55.010 
and it will become our last pool you can
keep<00:01:46.710> getting<00:01:47.870> the<00:01:48.870> you<00:01:48.930> can<00:01:53.570> yeah<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.930> you

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
keep getting the you can yeah that you

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.840 
keep getting the you can yeah that you
can<00:01:55.170> keep<00:01:55.350> getting<00:01:55.530> buckets<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.460> water<00:01:56.490> out<00:01:56.820> of

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
can keep getting buckets of water out of

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.430 
can keep getting buckets of water out of
and<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.450> will<00:01:57.630> never<00:01:57.780> run<00:01:58.530> out<00:01:59.990> like<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.260> put

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
and it will never run out like you put

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.969 
and it will never run out like you put
that<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.680> there<00:02:01.910> go<00:02:02.910> get<00:02:03.060> another<00:02:03.210> one<00:02:03.890> so<00:02:04.890> you

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
that in there go get another one so you

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.410 
that in there go get another one so you
can<00:02:05.100> use<00:02:05.220> that<00:02:05.369> for<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.610> water<00:02:05.820> but<00:02:06.210> for<00:02:06.360> the

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
can use that for the water but for the

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.760 
can use that for the water but for the
larvae<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:06.990> you're<00:02:07.260> gonna<00:02:07.380> need<00:02:07.500> something

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
larvae and you're gonna need something

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
larvae and you're gonna need something
underground<00:02:08.009> like<00:02:08.369> an<00:02:08.550> underground<00:02:10.790> lava

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
underground like an underground lava

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.949 
underground like an underground lava
pool<00:02:12.440> so<00:02:13.440> anyway<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.740> start<00:02:14.190> I<00:02:15.060> like<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:15.750> use

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
pool so anyway to start I like to use

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.400 
pool so anyway to start I like to use
frames<00:02:16.290> like<00:02:16.500> this<00:02:16.709> one<00:02:16.950> because<00:02:17.270> it's<00:02:18.410> it's

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
frames like this one because it's it's

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.840 
frames like this one because it's it's
just<00:02:19.530> basically<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.100> whole<00:02:20.220> mold<00:02:20.430> in<00:02:20.580> one<00:02:20.730> but

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
just basically the whole mold in one but

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.420 
just basically the whole mold in one but
you<00:02:20.940> can<00:02:21.180> like<00:02:21.510> mold<00:02:22.050> each<00:02:22.350> block<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:23.250> then<00:02:23.310> I

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
you can like mold each block and then I

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.580 
you can like mold each block and then I
take<00:02:23.610> away<00:02:23.760> that<00:02:23.880> modern<00:02:24.150> put<00:02:24.330> an<00:02:24.390> animal<00:02:24.720> so

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
take away that modern put an animal so

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.260 
take away that modern put an animal so
anyway<00:02:26.690> you<00:02:27.690> start<00:02:27.989> off<00:02:28.200> by<00:02:28.770> putting<00:02:29.160> a<00:02:29.400> down

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
anyway you start off by putting a down

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.790 
anyway you start off by putting a down
so<00:02:30.510> it's<00:02:30.630> flooding<00:02:31.020> and<00:02:31.170> then<00:02:31.320> you<00:02:31.380> put<00:02:31.590> the

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
so it's flooding and then you put the

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.920 
so it's flooding and then you put the
lava<00:02:32.040> bucket<00:02:32.459> in<00:02:32.820> the<00:02:33.000> sauce<00:02:33.209> look<00:02:33.480> so<00:02:33.780> tan

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
lava bucket in the sauce look so tan

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.630 
lava bucket in the sauce look so tan
obsidian<00:02:35.180> do<00:02:36.180> this<00:02:36.360> with<00:02:36.570> the<00:02:36.660> rest<00:02:36.900> like<00:02:37.140> this

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
obsidian do this with the rest like this

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.120 
obsidian do this with the rest like this
down<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.760> bottom<00:02:38.880> and<00:02:39.810> you<00:02:40.770> leave<00:02:40.920> a<00:02:40.950> little

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
down the bottom and you leave a little

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.920 
down the bottom and you leave a little
thing<00:02:41.400> down<00:02:41.520> there<00:02:41.580> because<00:02:41.910> if<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.120> just<00:02:42.300> do

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
thing down there because if you just do

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.770 
thing down there because if you just do
this<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:44.430> just<00:02:44.459> put<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.940> log<00:02:45.120> there<00:02:45.450> then

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
this and just put the log there then

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.630 
this and just put the log there then
we're<00:02:46.020> turn<00:02:46.170> straight<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:46.560> lava<00:02:46.769> and<00:02:47.430> straight

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
we're turn straight to lava and straight

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.490 
we're turn straight to lava and straight
back<00:02:47.760> to<00:02:47.790> water<00:02:48.030> so<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:48.810> need<00:02:48.959> to<00:02:49.049> have<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:49.200> tiny

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
back to water so you need to have a tiny

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.949 
back to water so you need to have a tiny
bit<00:02:49.680> of<00:02:49.739> it<00:02:49.799> flowing<00:02:50.280> off<00:02:50.459> to<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.760> side<00:02:50.970> so<00:02:51.930> you

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
bit of it flowing off to the side so you

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.240 
bit of it flowing off to the side so you
can<00:02:52.130> you<00:02:53.130> know<00:02:53.250> you<00:02:53.310> can<00:02:53.400> change<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.910> city<00:02:55.250> and

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
can you know you can change the city and

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.580 
can you know you can change the city and
then<00:02:56.580> it<00:02:56.850> works<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.239> same<00:02:57.269> just<00:02:57.840> going<00:02:58.110> up<00:02:58.290> you

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
then it works the same just going up you

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.930 
then it works the same just going up you
just<00:02:58.799> put<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:58.980> block<00:02:59.160> of<00:02:59.310> water<00:02:59.459> might<00:02:59.820> get

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
just put a block of water might get

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.940 
just put a block of water might get
messy<00:03:00.269> for<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:01.019> you<00:03:01.260> know

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.309 

and<00:03:05.950> you<00:03:06.849> basically<00:03:07.150> yeah<00:03:07.959> you<00:03:08.019> just<00:03:08.230> keep

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
and you basically yeah you just keep

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.289 
and you basically yeah you just keep
doing<00:03:08.500> this<00:03:08.830> and<00:03:10.920> it<00:03:11.920> does<00:03:12.129> have<00:03:12.459> been<00:03:12.970> I<00:03:13.180> me

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
doing this and it does have been I me

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.449 
doing this and it does have been I me
and<00:03:13.480> obviously<00:03:13.870> you<00:03:14.379> know<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:14.680> funding<00:03:15.099> this

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
and obviously you know the funding this

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:22.940 
and obviously you know the funding this
creative<00:03:15.970> but<00:03:16.180> you<00:03:17.280> doing<00:03:18.280> on<00:03:18.370> survival<00:03:19.030> then

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.030 

there<00:03:23.950> it<00:03:24.250> worse<00:03:24.670> but<00:03:25.620> what<00:03:26.620> do<00:03:26.799> you<00:03:26.860> want<00:03:27.010> a

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
there it worse but what do you want a

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.710 
there it worse but what do you want a
flying<00:03:27.340> but<00:03:27.760> make<00:03:28.269> sure<00:03:28.299> we<00:03:28.450> don't<00:03:28.569> have

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
flying but make sure we don't have

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.330 
flying but make sure we don't have
anything<00:03:28.900> little<00:03:29.260> parish<00:03:29.620> on<00:03:29.769> with<00:03:29.980> life<00:03:30.159> you

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
anything little parish on with life you

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.670 
anything little parish on with life you
putting<00:03:31.090> right<00:03:31.299> at<00:03:31.420> your<00:03:31.569> redstone<00:03:31.959> creation

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
putting right at your redstone creation
