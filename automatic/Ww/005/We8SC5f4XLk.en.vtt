00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
twice and that's a very nice option but

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.090 
twice and that's a very nice option but

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
in my league so that was in the

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.660 
in my league so that was in the
proportion<00:00:50.989> so<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.620> just<00:00:53.070> have<00:00:53.280> three<00:00:53.460> options

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
proportion so I just have three options

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.299 
proportion so I just have three options
left<00:00:54.120> or<00:00:54.420> either<00:00:54.870> going<00:00:55.320> electricity<00:00:56.100> or

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
left or either going electricity or

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.330 
left or either going electricity or

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
sorcery or native I really wanted to

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.880

change<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.879> sorcery<00:01:00.480> which<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.469> poor<00:01:01.710> I

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
change the sorcery which is the poor I

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.450 
change the sorcery which is the poor I
tested<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.579> most<00:01:03.409> but<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:05.010> load-out<00:01:05.400> I

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
tested the most but the load-out I

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.510 
tested the most but the load-out I
figure<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.090> out<00:01:06.299> need<00:01:06.900> some<00:01:07.229> plasters<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.830> I

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520
