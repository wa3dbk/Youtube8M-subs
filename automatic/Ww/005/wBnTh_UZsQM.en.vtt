the<00:03:34.660> ballista<00:03:35.319> of<00:03:35.410> course<00:03:35.680> will<00:03:35.889> be<00:03:36.010> amazing

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
the ballista of course will be amazing

would be awesome and you know the fact
that's<00:03:44.440> a<00:03:44.980> lot<00:03:45.340> of<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:45.849> guns<00:03:46.150> on<00:03:47.139> the<00:03:47.650> list

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:47.889 
that's a lot of the guns on the list

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:49.979 
that's a lot of the guns on the list
like<00:03:48.370> for<00:03:48.609> assault<00:03:48.910> rifles<00:03:49.269> for<00:03:49.510> submachine

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
like for assault rifles for submachine

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.259 
like for assault rifles for submachine
guns<00:03:50.230> come<00:03:51.010> from<00:03:51.190> i<00:03:51.310> called<00:03:51.579> it<00:03:51.699> egos<00:03:51.940> and

guns come from i called it egos and

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.539 
guns come from i called it egos and
she's<00:03:52.480> like<00:03:52.629> previous<00:03:52.870> Call<00:03:53.290> of<00:03:53.319> Duty's<00:03:53.680> that

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
she's like previous Call of Duty's that

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.030 
she's like previous Call of Duty's that
leads<00:03:55.030> me<00:03:55.150> to<00:03:55.359> believe<00:03:55.389> that<00:03:55.959> this<00:03:56.620> list<00:03:56.919> is

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
leads me to believe that this list is

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.520 
leads me to believe that this list is
definitely<00:03:57.579> you<00:03:58.120> know<00:03:58.209> not<00:03:58.449> true<00:03:58.780> not<00:03:59.139> fact

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
definitely you know not true not fact

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.530 
definitely you know not true not fact
but<00:03:59.949> we're<00:04:00.280> gonna<00:04:00.400> have<00:04:00.489> to<00:04:00.609> you<00:04:01.120> know<00:04:01.269> wait

ciphers<00:04:15.609> I<00:04:15.730> mean<00:04:15.910> world<00:04:16.690> at<00:04:16.930> war<00:04:16.959> had<00:04:17.530> like<00:04:17.709> the

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
ciphers I mean world at war had like the

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.979 
ciphers I mean world at war had like the

best selection of snipers is actually
crazy<00:04:20.260> I<00:04:20.469> think<00:04:20.650> every<00:04:20.979> single<00:04:21.340> sniper

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
crazy I think every single sniper

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.480

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
one and the ptrs is a machine like it's
