00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
here and then get the and a logical is

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.090 
here and then get the and a logical is
right<00:02:18.300> close<00:02:18.990> to<00:02:19.020> base<00:02:19.410> of<00:02:19.590> your<00:02:19.680> eyelashes

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
and just gently squeeze they're not too

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.740 
and just gently squeeze they're not too
not<00:02:23.070> too<00:02:23.130> harsh<00:02:23.550> because<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:23.940> still<00:02:24.360> create<00:02:24.720> a

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
not too harsh because you still create a

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.350 
not too harsh because you still create a
real<00:02:24.959> shock<00:02:25.490> kink<00:02:26.490> and<00:02:26.670> your<00:02:26.850> eyelashes<00:02:27.209> and

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
real shock kink and your eyelashes and

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.720 
real shock kink and your eyelashes and
then<00:02:27.450> just<00:02:27.630> gently<00:02:27.900> keep<00:02:28.380> squeezing<00:02:28.709> them<00:02:29.010> as

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
then just gently keep squeezing them as

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.550 
then just gently keep squeezing them as
you<00:02:29.880> might<00:02:30.030> work<00:02:30.510> your<00:02:30.660> way<00:02:30.780> up<00:02:30.810> towards<00:02:31.530> the

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
you might work your way up towards the

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.750 
you might work your way up towards the
end<00:02:31.620> of<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.830> rushes<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.280> you<00:02:32.370> create<00:02:32.700> a

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
end of the rushes and you create a

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:39.830 
end of the rushes and you create a
natural<00:02:37.730> just<00:02:38.730> squeeze<00:02:39.000> them<00:02:39.150> gently<00:02:39.510> and

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
natural just squeeze them gently and

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.390 
natural just squeeze them gently and
then<00:02:39.930> work<00:02:40.200> your<00:02:40.230> way<00:02:40.380> out<00:02:40.530> towards<00:02:41.520> the<00:02:41.790> ends

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
then work your way out towards the ends

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.949 
then work your way out towards the ends
and<00:02:44.400> again<00:02:44.790> when<00:02:44.970> you<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.300> get<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.570> most<00:02:45.600> out

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
and again when you to get the most out

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.560 
and again when you to get the most out
in<00:02:46.140> style<00:02:46.410> because<00:02:46.620> each<00:02:47.370> muscaria<00:02:48.060> you<00:02:48.450> know

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
in style because each muscaria you know

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.360 
in style because each muscaria you know
you<00:02:48.630> can<00:02:48.900> get<00:02:49.050> painful<00:02:49.650> really<00:02:49.800> good<00:02:50.040> start

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
you can get painful really good start

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.280 
you can get painful really good start
but<00:02:50.520> if<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.820> way<00:02:50.970> you<00:02:51.030> apply<00:02:51.450> it<00:02:51.480> makes<00:02:52.110> a<00:02:52.200> big

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
but if the way you apply it makes a big

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.000 
but if the way you apply it makes a big
difference<00:02:53.870> so<00:02:54.870> if<00:02:54.930> you<00:02:55.020> get<00:02:55.200> your<00:02:55.350> scar<00:02:55.709> wand

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
difference so if you get your scar wand

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.479 
difference so if you get your scar wand
if<00:02:56.760> you<00:02:56.880> look<00:02:57.000> down<00:02:57.180> from<00:02:57.330> a<00:02:57.510> place<00:02:58.230> it<00:02:58.500> really

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
if you look down from a place it really

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:00.680 
if you look down from a place it really
mean<00:02:59.730> it<00:02:59.850> and<00:02:59.910> you<00:03:00.120> right<00:03:00.270> at<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.480> base<00:03:00.630> of

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
mean it and you right at the base of

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.350 
mean it and you right at the base of
your<00:03:00.840> lashes<00:03:01.020> then<00:03:01.890> it<00:03:02.040> should<00:03:02.190> pull<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:02.790> wand

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
your lashes then it should pull the wand

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.420 
your lashes then it should pull the wand
or<00:03:03.600> twist<00:03:03.989> it<00:03:04.230> ever<00:03:04.560> so<00:03:04.770> slightly<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:05.190> just

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
or twist it ever so slightly and just

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.130 
or twist it ever so slightly and just
working<00:03:05.610> really<00:03:05.760> slowly<00:03:06.239> out<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:06.780> others<00:03:07.110> and

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
working really slowly out to others and

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:13.030 
working really slowly out to others and
your<00:03:07.470> actions

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.399 

so<00:03:13.579> what<00:03:13.700> I'm<00:03:13.849> so<00:03:14.000> now<00:03:14.180> it<00:03:14.360> just<00:03:14.390> takes<00:03:15.140> away<00:03:15.349> if

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:15.409 
so what I'm so now it just takes away if

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:17.800 
so what I'm so now it just takes away if
you<00:03:15.590> can<00:03:15.739> see<00:03:16.010> the<00:03:16.700> options<00:03:17.030> for<00:03:17.150> learning

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
you can see the options for learning

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.240 
you can see the options for learning
looks<00:03:18.079> bit<00:03:18.319> messy<00:03:18.500> she<00:03:18.709> was<00:03:18.829> going<00:03:18.980> to<00:03:19.010> clean

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
looks bit messy she was going to clean

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:36.290 
looks bit messy she was going to clean
up<00:03:19.790> through<00:03:20.120> the<00:03:20.329> eyes

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.330 

so<00:03:37.170> I'm<00:03:37.260> going<00:03:37.410> to<00:03:37.440> do<00:03:37.590> is<00:03:37.740> add<00:03:37.890> a<00:03:37.920> little<00:03:38.160> bit

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
so I'm going to do is add a little bit

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.210 
so I'm going to do is add a little bit
more<00:03:38.490> moisturizer<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:39.530> if<00:03:40.530> you<00:03:40.680> just<00:03:40.920> Pat<00:03:41.190> it

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
more moisturizer and if you just Pat it

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.550 
more moisturizer and if you just Pat it
under<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.150> eye<00:03:42.180> tends<00:03:42.750> to<00:03:42.930> sort<00:03:43.140> of<00:03:43.170> work<00:03:43.350> its

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
under the eye tends to sort of work its

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.380 
under the eye tends to sort of work its
way<00:03:43.680> it<00:03:43.770> was<00:03:43.890> anyway<00:03:44.220> put<00:03:44.820> too<00:03:45.000> much<00:03:45.060> on<00:03:45.330> it

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
way it was anyway put too much on it

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:54.200 
way it was anyway put too much on it
will<00:03:45.750> tend<00:03:45.990> to<00:03:46.430> stay<00:03:47.430> quite<00:03:47.670> agree<00:03:47.910> so<00:03:53.210> I'm

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.210 
will tend to stay quite agree so I'm

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.330 
will tend to stay quite agree so I'm
just<00:03:54.360> going<00:03:54.510> to<00:03:54.570> go<00:03:54.690> over<00:03:54.740> this<00:03:55.740> edge<00:03:56.010> and<00:03:56.160> just

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
just going to go over this edge and just

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.980 
just going to go over this edge and just
with<00:03:56.610> the<00:03:56.700> comp<00:03:57.000> on<00:03:57.210> and<00:03:57.360> just<00:03:57.480> make<00:03:57.690> sure<00:03:57.870> it

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
with the comp on and just make sure it

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.820 
with the comp on and just make sure it
start<00:03:58.230> enough<00:04:00.350> it's<00:04:01.350> what<00:04:01.500> we're<00:04:01.590> gonna<00:04:01.680> do

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
start enough it's what we're gonna do

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.140 
start enough it's what we're gonna do
again<00:04:02.100> is<00:04:02.250> we're<00:04:02.340> going<00:04:02.430> to<00:04:02.490> use<00:04:02.640> the<00:04:02.730> Riviera

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
again is we're going to use the Riviera

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.140 
again is we're going to use the Riviera
with<00:04:03.570> the<00:04:04.320> solvent<00:04:05.280> and<00:04:05.640> we're<00:04:05.790> going<00:04:05.910> to<00:04:05.940> draw

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
with the solvent and we're going to draw

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.680 
with the solvent and we're going to draw
a<00:04:06.180> line<00:04:06.480> and<00:04:06.900> you<00:04:07.140> know<00:04:08.300> good<00:04:09.300> from<00:04:09.450> inner

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
a line and you know good from inner

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.190 
a line and you know good from inner
corner<00:04:10.140> of<00:04:10.320> the<00:04:10.440> eye<00:04:11.420> and<00:04:12.420> work<00:04:12.840> your<00:04:13.020> way<00:04:13.080> out

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
corner of the eye and work your way out

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.420 
corner of the eye and work your way out
towards<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.920> outer<00:04:14.100> corner<00:04:16.310> when<00:04:17.310> you're

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
towards the outer corner when you're

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.250 
towards the outer corner when you're
working<00:04:17.549> it<00:04:17.880> if<00:04:18.420> you<00:04:18.510> starting<00:04:18.900> at<00:04:19.019> the<00:04:19.049> inner

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
working it if you starting at the inner

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.990 
working it if you starting at the inner
corner<00:04:19.650> it<00:04:19.739> needs<00:04:19.950> to<00:04:20.040> be<00:04:20.130> slightly<00:04:20.430> narrower

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
corner it needs to be slightly narrower

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.910 
corner it needs to be slightly narrower
than<00:04:21.420> when<00:04:21.660> you<00:04:21.750> get<00:04:21.900> to<00:04:22.019> the<00:04:22.109> outside<00:04:22.530> and

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 
than when you get to the outside and

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.550 
than when you get to the outside and
also<00:04:23.490> these<00:04:23.850> two<00:04:24.210> the<00:04:24.900> line<00:04:25.110> you've<00:04:25.320> created

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
also these two the line you've created

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.100 
also these two the line you've created
thought<00:04:25.950> that<00:04:26.370> it<00:04:26.610> needs<00:04:27.390> to<00:04:27.540> meet<00:04:27.720> the<00:04:27.900> line

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
thought that it needs to meet the line

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.020 
thought that it needs to meet the line
that<00:04:28.350> you<00:04:28.410> can<00:04:28.620> lay<00:04:28.710> underneath<00:04:29.040> as<00:04:29.310> well<00:04:29.400> what

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
that you can lay underneath as well what

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.110 
that you can lay underneath as well what
you<00:04:30.090> do<00:04:30.330> is<00:04:30.360> use<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:31.310> Quahog<00:04:32.310> in<00:04:32.820> the<00:04:32.910> flag

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
you do is use the Quahog in the flag

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.940 
you do is use the Quahog in the flag
we're<00:04:33.810> actually<00:04:33.960> going<00:04:34.200> to<00:04:34.290> use<00:04:34.320> it<00:04:34.590> inside

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
we're actually going to use it inside

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:40.850 
we're actually going to use it inside

anything<00:05:24.700> I<00:05:25.000> think<00:05:25.210> sometimes<00:05:25.540> when<00:05:25.600> you

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
anything I think sometimes when you

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.510 
anything I think sometimes when you
really<00:05:25.930> close<00:05:26.170> up<00:05:26.410> you<00:05:26.950> don't<00:05:27.070> see<00:05:27.310> in<00:05:27.400> the

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
really close up you don't see in the

really close up you don't see in the
overall<00:05:27.850> look<00:05:28.740> now<00:05:29.740> I<00:05:29.770> tend<00:05:30.220> to<00:05:30.340> only<00:05:30.550> put<00:05:30.970> a

overall look now I tend to only put a

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.860 
overall look now I tend to only put a
touch<00:05:32.530> of<00:05:32.680> mascara<00:05:33.010> on<00:05:33.430> the<00:05:33.520> lower<00:05:34.180> lash<00:05:34.420> it<00:05:34.630> I

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
touch of mascara on the lower lash it I

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.870 
touch of mascara on the lower lash it I
think<00:05:35.530> sometimes<00:05:35.800> of<00:05:36.070> putting<00:05:36.400> the<00:05:36.490> Charlie's
