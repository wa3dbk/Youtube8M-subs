top price and i haven't seen anything
that<00:02:42.170> would<00:02:42.410> suggest<00:02:42.680> that<00:02:42.950> we<00:02:43.100> should<00:02:43.130> drift

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
that would suggest that we should drift

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.970 
that would suggest that we should drift
in<00:02:43.700> place<00:02:43.910> so<00:02:44.120> 1<00:02:44.270> 95<00:02:44.780> looks<00:02:45.020> quite<00:02:45.739> a<00:02:45.770> decent

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
in place so 1 95 looks quite a decent

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.610 
in place so 1 95 looks quite a decent
price<00:02:46.400> there<00:02:46.700> is<00:02:46.880> it<00:02:47.360> algeria<00:02:47.989> need<00:02:48.140> to<00:02:48.290> enter

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
price there is it algeria need to enter

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
price there is it algeria need to enter
