last week or a week and a half ago we
said<00:01:33.720> there's<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:34.140> much<00:01:34.290> value<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.770> have<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.430> guy

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729

like<00:01:35.759> foster<00:01:36.390> with<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.750> injury<00:01:37.079> issues<00:01:37.380> is

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
like foster with the injury issues is

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.469 
like foster with the injury issues is
somebody<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.369> wasn't<00:01:38.759> really<00:01:38.880> drafting

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
somebody that I wasn't really drafting

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.300 
somebody that I wasn't really drafting
you<00:01:39.720> know<00:01:39.869> even<00:01:40.290> before<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:40.710> injury<00:01:41.009> is<00:01:41.040> like

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
you know even before this injury is like

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.710 
you know even before this injury is like
I<00:01:41.400> don't<00:01:41.490> want<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.729> take<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.939> risk<00:01:41.970> on<00:01:42.270> Foster

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
I don't want to take the risk on Foster

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.359 
I don't want to take the risk on Foster
now<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.170> know<00:01:43.619> with<00:01:43.860> now<00:01:43.979> these<00:01:44.130> going<00:01:44.310> to

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
now you know with now these going to

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.980 
now you know with now these going to
miss<00:01:44.549> maybe<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.000> first<00:01:45.149> month<00:01:45.450> now<00:01:45.630> we<00:01:45.689> know<00:01:45.960> a

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
miss maybe the first month now we know a

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.120 
miss maybe the first month now we know a
little<00:01:46.140> bit<00:01:46.320> more<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.619> could<00:01:46.770> miss<00:01:46.920> two<00:01:47.040> to

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
little bit more you could miss two to

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.980 
little bit more you could miss two to
four<00:01:47.280> weeks<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.850> don't<00:01:48.540> mind<00:01:48.720> him<00:01:48.780> at<00:01:48.899> all

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
four weeks I don't mind him at all

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.910 
four weeks I don't mind him at all
especially<00:01:49.170> where<00:01:49.500> he's<00:01:49.590> going<00:01:49.770> obviously

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
especially where he's going obviously

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.170 
especially where he's going obviously
Pat<00:01:50.340> you're<00:01:50.490> right<00:01:50.640> he's<00:01:50.759> probably<00:01:50.939> going<00:01:51.119> to

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
Pat you're right he's probably going to

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.210 
Pat you're right he's probably going to
move<00:01:51.299> up<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.960> ATP<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.439> going<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.649> rise<00:01:52.799> for<00:01:53.100> him

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
move up the ATP is going to rise for him

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.160 
move up the ATP is going to rise for him
but<00:01:53.909> certainly<00:01:54.210> he's<00:01:54.390> worth<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.750> risk<00:01:54.960> now

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
but certainly he's worth the risk now

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.660 
but certainly he's worth the risk now
you're<00:01:55.350> not<00:01:55.470> drafting<00:01:55.920> him<00:01:56.009> still<00:01:56.250> as<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.549> be<00:01:56.640> a

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
you're not drafting him still as to be a

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.639 
you're not drafting him still as to be a
top-five<00:01:56.939> back<00:01:57.360> but<00:01:58.110> he<00:01:58.170> certainly<00:01:58.380> has<00:01:58.619> the

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
top-five back but he certainly has the

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.950 
top-five back but he certainly has the
upside<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.310> be<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.700> top<00:01:59.909> I<00:02:00.060> back<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.479> will<00:02:00.750> say

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
upside to be that top I back I will say

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.080 
upside to be that top I back I will say
don't<00:02:01.229> expect<00:02:01.469> him<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.740> just<00:02:01.770> be<00:02:02.250> Arian<00:02:02.670> Foster

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
don't expect him to just be Arian Foster

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.940 
don't expect him to just be Arian Foster
in<00:02:03.180> week<00:02:03.360> two<00:02:03.630> maybe<00:02:03.960> even<00:02:04.049> not<00:02:04.320> even<00:02:04.350> week<00:02:04.680> for

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
in week two maybe even not even week for

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.020 
in week two maybe even not even week for
it's<00:02:05.040> going<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.280> take<00:02:05.430> some<00:02:05.460> time<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.909> come

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
it's going to take some time to come

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.240 
it's going to take some time to come
back<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.299> little<00:02:06.600> bit<00:02:06.840> however<00:02:07.469> I<00:02:07.740> mean<00:02:07.979> even<00:02:08.069> if

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
back a little bit however I mean even if

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.460 
back a little bit however I mean even if
he's<00:02:08.369> Arian<00:02:08.700> Foster<00:02:09.000> by<00:02:09.119> week<00:02:09.300> six<00:02:09.349> then<00:02:10.349> oh

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
he's Arian Foster by week six then oh

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.960 
he's Arian Foster by week six then oh
you're<00:02:10.679> still<00:02:10.830> beating<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.160> expectations<00:02:11.849> by

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
you're still beating the expectations by

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.490 
you're still beating the expectations by
at<00:02:12.090> least<00:02:12.239> four<00:02:12.480> weeks<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:13.020> then<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.290> get
