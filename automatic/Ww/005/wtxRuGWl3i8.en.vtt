00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.390
 the bills and coins are 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.579
 condemned to disappear from the planet 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:11.000
 land since the appearance of 

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:13.490
 credit cards is no longer necessary 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.760
 the physical presence of a coin to 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:19.460
 know the money you have in fact I 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:23.000
 I will inspire in a recent example a 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:26.090
 country that practically no longer uses 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.480
 bills or coins to pay is about 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:32.450
 from Sweden sweden has drawn up a plan to 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.360
 through which it aims to reduce 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.030
 crime and the number of robberies 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.290
 try not to pay with money to pay 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:44.810
 absolutely everything with cards and credits 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.790
 for example in some places of sweden 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:50.000
 you can give alms to the poor 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:53.720
 putting money into your bank account 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.030
 through a card you can also 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.030
 pay by card through mobile 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.430
 has created an application capable of paying 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.770
 through the mobile phone as you can see the 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.680
 Technological advances are becoming more 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.920
 accused and as I said so much 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.170
 the bills as the coins 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.110
 will disappear in a matter of years now 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.590
 nobody will see the money nobody will see the 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:22.310
 money is to say people will know that you have 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:25.280
 money but you will not see it physically 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.729
 you will see in numbers on your card in your ex 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.840
 in your bank statement you will never have it 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.420
 in hand but it will exist 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.579
 curious but true the most countries 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.130
 advanced and developed are already 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:42.670
 launching this system that is 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.429
 much more safe and effective as I have already 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.409
 said reduces the level of crime and 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:50.649
 it is anticipated that in a matter of 10 or 20 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:54.069
 years all the countries of the world have 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:56.619
 decreased to 3 percent the use of 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:58.420
 bills and coins as is 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.990
 happening in the Scandinavian country of 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.239
 sweden is really about a measure 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.360
 that had to happen sooner or later 

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:09.239
 because society is evolving and 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.239
 the bills and coins will be 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.239
 unnecessary
