00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
shocks and I had serious speed wobble I

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.679 
shocks and I had serious speed wobble I
fell<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:32.520> that's<00:01:33.090> one<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.360> things<00:01:33.509> that

board goes that way and um so first let
me<00:02:04.619> talk<00:02:04.770> about<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.159> shock<00:02:05.909> system<00:02:06.920> here's

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
me talk about the shock system here's

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.070 
me talk about the shock system here's
the<00:02:08.099> actual<00:02:08.340> shocks<00:02:08.729> themselves<00:02:08.970> right<00:02:09.840> there

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
the actual shocks themselves right there

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.360 
the actual shocks themselves right there
I<00:02:10.289> have<00:02:11.039> two<00:02:11.280> red<00:02:11.459> ones

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.240 
if you want to change the shocks you can
actually<00:02:16.450> put<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.750> shocks<00:02:17.019> in<00:02:17.590> these<00:02:18.099> little

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
actually put the shocks in these little

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.770 
actually put the shocks in these little
holes<00:02:18.370> over<00:02:18.970> here<00:02:19.150> on<00:02:19.269> the<00:02:19.360> bottom<00:02:19.480> of<00:02:19.720> the

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.210 
board which is what I did and if you
want<00:02:24.610> to<00:02:24.670> change<00:02:24.819> the<00:02:24.970> shocks<00:02:25.180> you<00:02:25.300> just<00:02:25.510> take

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
want to change the shocks you just take

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.150 
want to change the shocks you just take
take<00:02:27.220> this<00:02:27.629> take<00:02:28.629> this<00:02:28.660> knob<00:02:28.930> and<00:02:29.230> you<00:02:29.349> loosen

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
take this take this knob and you loosen

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:37.440 
take this take this knob and you loosen
it<00:02:31.950> take<00:02:32.950> off<00:02:33.330> truck<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:36.060> this<00:02:37.060> is<00:02:37.209> so<00:02:37.390> much

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
it take off truck and this is so much

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.789 
it take off truck and this is so much
harder<00:02:37.569> to<00:02:37.870> do<00:02:37.989> with<00:02:38.080> one<00:02:38.260> hand<00:02:38.290> than<00:02:38.620> you

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
harder to do with one hand than you

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.690 
harder to do with one hand than you
think<00:02:39.010> and<00:02:40.019> so<00:02:41.019> just<00:02:41.860> change<00:02:42.129> the<00:02:42.250> shocks<00:02:42.519> you

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
think and so just change the shocks you

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.289 
think and so just change the shocks you
take<00:02:42.879> them<00:02:43.000> out<00:02:43.120> put<00:02:43.450> them<00:02:44.140> back<00:02:44.260> in<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:46.150> then

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
take them out put them back in and then

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:53.300 
take them out put them back in and then
you<00:02:46.390> just<00:02:46.599> put<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:46.840> truck<00:02:46.959> on<00:02:48.239> back<00:02:50.370> if<00:02:51.370> I<00:02:51.760> can

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
you just put the truck on back if I can

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.750 
you just put the truck on back if I can
sweet<00:02:54.310> a<00:02:54.340> little<00:02:54.430> bit<00:02:54.670> guys<00:02:57.720> there<00:02:58.720> we<00:02:58.840> go<00:02:58.989> I

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
sweet a little bit guys there we go I

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.890 
sweet a little bit guys there we go I
don't<00:03:00.760> know<00:03:00.849> if<00:03:00.940> you<00:03:01.030> guys<00:03:01.150> can<00:03:01.299> see<00:03:01.480> that<00:03:01.510> you

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
don't know if you guys can see that you

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.180 
don't know if you guys can see that you
just<00:03:02.079> take<00:03:02.260> that<00:03:02.579> put<00:03:03.579> it<00:03:03.700> back<00:03:03.790> in<00:03:05.040> put<00:03:06.040> the

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
just take that put it back in put the

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:13.050 
just take that put it back in put the
knob<00:03:06.370> back<00:03:06.579> on<00:03:07.379> and<00:03:08.379> tighten<00:03:08.709> it<00:03:11.730> and<00:03:12.730> tighten

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
knob back on and tighten it and tighten

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.190 
knob back on and tighten it and tighten
it<00:03:13.150> you<00:03:13.690> know<00:03:13.780> so<00:03:14.620> it's<00:03:15.129> really<00:03:15.310> easy<00:03:15.579> to<00:03:15.700> just

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
it you know so it's really easy to just

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.379 
it you know so it's really easy to just
change<00:03:17.200> the<00:03:17.410> shocks<00:03:17.680> and<00:03:18.010> actually<00:03:18.700> something

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:19.389 
change the shocks and actually something

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.599 
change the shocks and actually something
that<00:03:19.540> I<00:03:19.660> forgot<00:03:19.900> to<00:03:19.959> mention<00:03:20.079> is<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:21.340> board

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
that I forgot to mention is the board

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:26.520 
that I forgot to mention is the board
actually<00:03:21.970> came<00:03:22.859> fully<00:03:23.859> apart<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:25.530> actual

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
actually came fully apart the actual

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.960 
actually came fully apart the actual
board<00:03:26.769> itself<00:03:28.230> was<00:03:29.230> it<00:03:30.040> came<00:03:30.220> with<00:03:30.459> the<00:03:30.730> actual

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
board itself was it came with the actual

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.199 
board itself was it came with the actual
board<00:03:31.150> itself<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:32.470> wheels<00:03:32.709> themselves<00:03:33.209> the

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
board itself the wheels themselves the

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:39.420 
board itself the wheels themselves the
truck<00:03:35.170> itself<00:03:35.530> and<00:03:36.190> then<00:03:36.940> the<00:03:37.090> shocks<00:03:38.430> by

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
truck itself and then the shocks by

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.120 
truck itself and then the shocks by
themselves<00:03:40.169> but<00:03:41.169> it<00:03:41.260> actually<00:03:41.620> wasn't<00:03:41.859> that

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
themselves but it actually wasn't that

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.830 
themselves but it actually wasn't that
hard<00:03:42.430> to<00:03:42.549> put<00:03:42.639> together<00:03:42.910> it<00:03:43.150> was<00:03:43.239> really<00:03:43.269> easy

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
hard to put together it was really easy

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.349 
hard to put together it was really easy
actually<00:03:44.200> and<00:03:44.819> here's<00:03:45.819> something<00:03:46.030> that<00:03:46.150> I'm

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
actually and here's something that I'm

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.349 
actually and here's something that I'm
going<00:03:46.480> to<00:03:46.569> tell<00:03:47.319> you<00:03:47.410> guys<00:03:47.530> um<00:03:47.950> it's<00:03:48.910> gone

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
going to tell you guys um it's gone

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:51.839 
going to tell you guys um it's gone
though<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.660> wheels<00:03:49.840> so<00:03:50.829> the<00:03:51.370> wheels<00:03:51.579> are<00:03:51.790> just

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
though the wheels so the wheels are just

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:54.870 
though the wheels so the wheels are just
huge<00:03:52.480> and<00:03:52.870> they'll<00:03:53.590> just<00:03:53.859> keep<00:03:54.250> on<00:03:54.459> spinning

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
huge and they'll just keep on spinning

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.009 
huge and they'll just keep on spinning
forever<00:03:55.599> and<00:03:56.410> I'll<00:03:56.590> make<00:03:57.069> another<00:03:57.310> video<00:03:57.579> of<00:03:58.019> a

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
forever and I'll make another video of a

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.449 
forever and I'll make another video of a
spin<00:03:59.829> test<00:04:00.540> with<00:04:01.540> the<00:04:02.040> regular<00:04:03.040> bearings<00:04:03.340> that

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
spin test with the regular bearings that

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.780 
spin test with the regular bearings that
it<00:04:03.549> comes<00:04:03.730> with<00:04:03.819> and<00:04:04.450> if<00:04:05.169> I<00:04:05.319> got<00:04:05.470> your<00:04:06.160> soon<00:04:06.579> I

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
it comes with and if I got your soon I

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.500 
it comes with and if I got your soon I
might<00:04:07.000> get<00:04:07.290> bones<00:04:08.290> Reds<00:04:08.620> which<00:04:08.950> might<00:04:09.510> just

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
might get bones Reds which might just

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.750 
might get bones Reds which might just
make<00:04:10.840> this<00:04:11.430> spin<00:04:12.430> forever<00:04:14.099> so<00:04:15.099> if<00:04:15.400> you<00:04:15.489> want<00:04:15.669> to

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
make this spin forever so if you want to

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:22.070 
make this spin forever so if you want to
change<00:04:15.970> the<00:04:16.299> wheels<00:04:16.810> are<00:04:17.049> just<00:04:17.760> untighten

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.670 

and<00:04:23.080> then<00:04:24.150> take<00:04:25.150> it<00:04:25.300> off<00:04:25.449> and<00:04:25.900> then<00:04:25.960> you<00:04:26.229> can<00:04:26.259> do

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
and then take it off and then you can do

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.219 
and then take it off and then you can do
whatever<00:04:26.919> you<00:04:27.220> want<00:04:27.430> with<00:04:27.819> the<00:04:28.780> bearings

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229 
whatever you want with the bearings

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:30.980 
whatever you want with the bearings
whatever<00:04:29.800> and<00:04:30.069> it<00:04:30.159> actually<00:04:30.310> comes<00:04:30.669> with<00:04:30.759> a

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
whatever and it actually comes with a

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.869 
whatever and it actually comes with a
bearing<00:04:31.990> spacer<00:04:32.500> just<00:04:33.430> kind<00:04:33.610> of<00:04:33.699> neat<00:04:33.879> so<00:04:34.530> just

00:04:35.869 --> 00:04:35.879 
bearing spacer just kind of neat so just

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:40.800 
bearing spacer just kind of neat so just
if<00:04:36.879> you<00:04:37.090> just<00:04:37.120> want<00:04:37.509> to<00:04:37.569> put<00:04:37.720> the<00:04:39.599> put<00:04:40.599> the

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
if you just want to put the put the

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.960 
if you just want to put the put the
wheel<00:04:41.379> back<00:04:41.409> on<00:04:41.740> once<00:04:41.979> you're<00:04:42.129> done<00:04:44.849> take<00:04:45.849> the

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
wheel back on once you're done take the

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.180 
wheel back on once you're done take the
bolt<00:04:46.210> put<00:04:47.110> in<00:04:47.229> as<00:04:47.409> much<00:04:47.530> as<00:04:47.590> you<00:04:47.740> can<00:04:47.949> with<00:04:48.099> your

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
bolt put in as much as you can with your

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.480 
bolt put in as much as you can with your
hand<00:04:48.900> take<00:04:49.900> the<00:04:50.080> wrench<00:04:50.319> tighten<00:04:51.009> it<00:04:51.099> all<00:04:51.280> the

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
hand take the wrench tighten it all the

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.219 
hand take the wrench tighten it all the
way<00:04:51.610> because<00:04:51.879> of<00:04:52.449> the<00:04:52.569> bearing<00:04:52.840> spacer<00:04:54.180> and

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
way because of the bearing spacer and

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:59.240 
way because of the bearing spacer and
give<00:04:56.229> it<00:04:56.349> a<00:04:56.380> little<00:04:56.500> test<00:04:56.800> it<00:04:57.430> spins<00:04:57.669> and<00:04:58.139> um

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
give it a little test it spins and um

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:06.390 
give it a little test it spins and um
shoot<00:05:00.690> and<00:05:01.690> I<00:05:02.530> think<00:05:04.590> that's<00:05:05.590> it<00:05:05.860> wait<00:05:06.190> one

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
shoot and I think that's it wait one

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.990 
shoot and I think that's it wait one
more<00:05:06.550> thing<00:05:06.610> what<00:05:07.330> does<00:05:07.419> it<00:05:07.509> say<00:05:07.690> here

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
more thing what does it say here

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.879 
more thing what does it say here
