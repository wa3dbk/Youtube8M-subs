00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:07.440
 First, the accompaniment of this song is fairly simple 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:14.190
 Ah 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.790
 Should I say Beginner novice who also is enough to be a variation 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:23.099
 There is 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:27.500
 For example, take a 2-stroke 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.500
 It was a rhythm . 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:35.030
 O 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:51.470
 Well, let 's go this way. Well , in this simple form, 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:55.850
 This program writes the rhythm between the continued practice narcissism might look wo 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:01:02.240
 Even if you only have these variations 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:06.130
 Doejyo billion sufficiently effective performers doing so lift Yes 5 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.130
 It 's easier to know 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.929
 Talk 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.170
 Cool 

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:15.170
 sure 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.600
 In training, while only fully possible with this type of stroke 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:33.119
 o Believing in faith 4 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:37.350
 The more negative the decorative strokes that did not come to you, so this rather 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:41.329
 If you want to practice some of these things, 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.329
 Following that basic stroke 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:49.579
 This is not awkward at all until I understand the static turn. 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.579
 Multiple allowances 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:02:15.210
 Rear air 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:18.040
 Ah you ah wah to her out 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.410
 outer 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.220
 Only back 3 sources 5 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:28.670
 I 'm talking about liver cancer . 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:31.940
 Oh my won 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.200
 I'll power it up and just throw in the stoker. 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:39.410
 this 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:43.879
 If you get a little bit of form , even a little 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:49.190
 Because you can decorate a variety of forms such word play word 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:57.380
 If the thought given to putting only two minutes I think there 's at least another suffice 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:59.750
 Oh, and before ordering the same, so no-one week earlier is negative 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:06.230
 I'll be right behind you. 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:08.830
 Rather than an addendum , it is nothing but a simulation of the r2 stroke 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.830
 Not before 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:31.310
 What remains doejyo what happened so that part is a little ah 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:33.760
 Try one o'clock on the study saw the score Oh when you try it again another 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.760
 wish
