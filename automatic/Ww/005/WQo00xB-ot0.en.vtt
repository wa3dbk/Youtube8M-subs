00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
today I'm using the p90 silenced and if

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.350 
today I'm using the p90 silenced and if
you<00:00:31.710> never<00:00:31.890> use<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.189> p90<00:00:32.700> with<00:00:32.850> silencer

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
you never use the p90 with silencer

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.180 
you never use the p90 with silencer
which<00:00:33.899> at<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.110> very<00:00:34.140> start<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.590> uses<00:00:34.920> scar-h

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
which at the very start of uses scar-h

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.490 
which at the very start of uses scar-h
but<00:00:35.610> if<00:00:35.790> you've<00:00:35.969> ever<00:00:36.180> used<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.780> p90<00:00:37.380> with

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
but if you've ever used the p90 with

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.319 
but if you've ever used the p90 with
silencer<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.670> absolutely<00:00:39.210> just

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
silencer it is absolutely just

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.750 
silencer it is absolutely just
destructive<00:00:40.320> if<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:41.040> get<00:00:41.219> them<00:00:41.340> like<00:00:41.489> close

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
destructive if you get them like close

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.400 
destructive if you get them like close
quarters<00:00:42.180> because<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.600> has<00:00:42.719> like<00:00:42.930> such<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.170> long

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
quarters because it has like such a long

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.470 
quarters because it has like such a long
magazine<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.670> can<00:00:44.820> probably<00:00:44.969> take<00:00:45.180> out<00:00:45.360> at

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
magazine you can probably take out at

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.270 
magazine you can probably take out at
least<00:00:45.629> like<00:00:45.780> five<00:00:46.050> people<00:00:46.320> but<00:00:46.800> at<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.039> start

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
least like five people but at the start

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.400 
least like five people but at the start
I<00:00:47.629> always<00:00:48.629> figure<00:00:48.899> this<00:00:48.989> is<00:00:49.050> gonna<00:00:49.230> be

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
I always figure this is gonna be

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.260 
I always figure this is gonna be
somebody<00:00:49.710> coming<00:00:49.829> down<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.160> hallway<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:51.239> I

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
somebody coming down this hallway so I

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.350 
somebody coming down this hallway so I
use<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.449> scar<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.020> take<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.410> guy<00:00:52.530> out<00:00:52.559> and

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
use a scar and I take that guy out and

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.479 
use a scar and I take that guy out and
the<00:00:54.360> only<00:00:54.539> thing<00:00:54.780> about<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.110> scar<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.739> uh<00:00:55.770> it's

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
the only thing about the scar is uh it's

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.340 
the only thing about the scar is uh it's
just<00:00:56.699> kind<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:56.969> sluggish<00:00:57.329> if<00:00:57.719> you're<00:00:58.079> trying

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
just kind of sluggish if you're trying

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.740 
just kind of sluggish if you're trying
to<00:00:58.440> do<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> lot<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.460> quick<00:00:59.730> maneuvering<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.570> like

a great gun overall and I'm not sure why
never<00:01:23.700> used<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.150> until<00:01:24.270> now<00:01:24.509> but<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.840> guy<00:01:25.049> my

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
never used it until now but a guy my

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.700 
never used it until now but a guy my
party<00:01:25.680> was<00:01:25.830> actually<00:01:26.189> using<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:26.640> gun<00:01:27.710> I'll

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
party was actually using this gun I'll

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.740 
party was actually using this gun I'll
probably<00:01:29.040> like<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.939> past<00:01:30.180> few<00:01:30.390> nights<00:01:30.450> I've

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
probably like the past few nights I've

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.270 
probably like the past few nights I've
played<00:01:31.020> since<00:01:31.409> we're<00:01:31.619> still<00:01:31.799> doing<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.130> winch

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.679 
played since we're still doing the winch
trick<00:01:32.549> this<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.820> actually<00:01:33.150> one<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.509> ones

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
trick this is actually one of the ones

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.530

multiplayer<00:04:16.409> is<00:04:16.680> you<00:04:16.979> got<00:04:17.099> like<00:04:17.280> a<00:04:17.310> it's<00:04:18.060> a

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
multiplayer is you got like a it's a

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.180 
multiplayer is you got like a it's a
forty<00:04:18.449> second<00:04:18.810> time<00:04:19.019> limit<00:04:19.380> but<00:04:19.620> it<00:04:20.039> only

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
forty second time limit but it only

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.159 
forty second time limit but it only
really<00:04:20.459> lasts<00:04:20.729> for<00:04:20.970> about<00:04:21.060> 35<00:04:21.719> seconds

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
really lasts for about 35 seconds

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.170 
really lasts for about 35 seconds
because<00:04:22.380> I<00:04:22.469> think<00:04:22.529> it<00:04:22.770> starts<00:04:23.370> at<00:04:23.460> 39<00:04:23.909> and<00:04:24.120> then

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
because I think it starts at 39 and then

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.209 
because I think it starts at 39 and then
it<00:04:24.300> goes<00:04:24.479> away<00:04:24.840> at<00:04:25.020> like<00:04:25.169> 4<00:04:25.500> or<00:04:25.529> 3<00:04:25.650> somewhere

00:04:26.209 --> 00:04:26.219 
it goes away at like 4 or 3 somewhere

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.780 
it goes away at like 4 or 3 somewhere
around<00:04:26.310> there

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
around there

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.160 
around there
