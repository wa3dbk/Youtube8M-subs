 Talk to me, everyone, beauty, I said, Orro. 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:29.710
 the bringing a strike against extreme v6 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.960
 I know, I do not know. 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.970
 now I do not know what it is but it's a 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.019
 I think it's very cool and train for you. 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:40.570
 have all that mold they can play 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:43.030
 What I like the most is the zombie scene. 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.360
 sectors that are 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:49.210
 and this is the channel 's first video is 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.790
 doing with your desire in many others 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:55.629
 I ask you to subscribe to the channel 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:58.449

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.170

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:01.210
 Cup 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.790
 by showing you with what I'm sure 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:08.020
 must have seen is for anyone who is a fan of csll 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.580
 had this game is to have played but the training 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.950
 from the team to people who have not seen 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:16.900
 who does not know the game very well then 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:26.229
 type is the first video you want to say 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:33.039
 also nervous about short on my facebook 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:35.020
 twitter and skype over here and who want 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:39.640
 make a game player with me further on 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:43.140
 skype and facebook and twitter 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.140
 so we'll see there 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:52.329
 he did the gameplay but he plays and see 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:56.200
 How do you charge so much? 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:58.749
 have a good player and we can power 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:03.719
 download will continue making videos 

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:06.340
 good n 6 that only has to win only you 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:15.970
 choose now this weapon that is very 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:17.590
 Good until I finish photocom seconds in the 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.150
 command has survived and kill the maximum 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:24.720
 that I can and survive I'm going to kill you 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.350
 the furry critters kansas killing his 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.350
 mouth just a shot 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.200
 enjoy the influence but left the team 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.690
 the latest invisible is a bit difficult to 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.730
 difficult it is to think in one building 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.770
 her that she has to be balanced 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.530
 only five shots I can from her 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.710
 with her you are close where you bought 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.740
 this blog the leader and purchase of a 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:56.200
 cart makes it easier to buy the bullet 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:59.650
 for her to play this game is not the 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:03.540
 enough is enough money explains the 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.540
 end of the video with which the money here 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:14.790
 buy country 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:14.790
 the good critters how to install this game 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:28.450
 is direct download went to a program 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:31.050
 called touch tite opted also serves the 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.050
 same thing 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.150
 today the river 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:04:04.959
 then the game prefers that the game that I do 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:10.630
 in play a series and day care I'll do 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:13.930
 a series of minecraft minecraft more 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:20.459
 I like that 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:27.760
 I was looking on YouTube which is a 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:38.650
 game that plays in series 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:40.450
 I think the physical treasury how to come back 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.020
 So you're saying that he 's 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:46.150
 excited guti too 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:50.020
 then the school is also what else has 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:53.080
 type series but more matter what the 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.360
 10k more games or stop 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.120
 despite a game does not have much graphic 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.069
 so the mini crash of elite groups 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.949
 with the squares 

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:07.360
 today the type ju who has a lot of fun 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:10.810
 playing the game does not just depend on graphics 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:13.569
 the dps of Grassi's just that I think 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:17.469
 depends on the course diverte playing type 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:20.469
 must have done the beauty graphics 

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:21.879
 graphic counts a lot but I do not think 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:24.789
 depends on it 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:27.509
 if you depend only on the graphs you would have 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:27.509
 very close together 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:38.110
 I already went to make a topic of the game but the 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:44.889
 graphic but more are the games 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:46.779

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:50.169

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:56.460

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.289

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:10.110
