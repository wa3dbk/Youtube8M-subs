Bears his time on all-pro to make it a

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.240 
Bears his time on all-pro to make it a
little<00:00:11.759> bit<00:00:11.910> easy<00:00:12.090> on<00:00:12.330> myself<00:00:12.480> but<00:00:13.009> the<00:00:14.009> game

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
little bit easy on myself but the game

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.510 
little bit easy on myself but the game
was<00:00:14.429> it<00:00:14.639> too<00:00:14.940> much<00:00:15.299> of<00:00:15.480> their<00:00:16.250> offensive<00:00:17.250> game

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
was it too much of their offensive game

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.170 
was it too much of their offensive game
but<00:00:18.180> my<00:00:18.449> defense<00:00:18.960> was<00:00:19.289> straight-up<00:00:19.800> beast<00:00:20.310> I'm

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
but my defense was straight-up beast I'm

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.050 
but my defense was straight-up beast I'm
not<00:00:21.449> gonna<00:00:21.630> lie<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:22.310> Chicago<00:00:23.310> Bears<00:00:23.460> defense

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
not gonna lie the Chicago Bears defense

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.019 
in this game so far I think it's pretty
damn<00:00:27.810> good<00:00:28.050> I'm<00:00:28.410> not<00:00:28.560> gonna<00:00:28.710> lie<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:29.279> was

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029
