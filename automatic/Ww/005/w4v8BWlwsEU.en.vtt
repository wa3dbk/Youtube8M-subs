00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:15.109
 40 years ago we started to build 

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:19.529
 at that time in an experiment 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.710
 a dream 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.710
 a city so much 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:27.269
 sun 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.689
 in the not too distant future a titanic project of man called the arq 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.350
 if at the end of humanity as a self-sufficient floating city that 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.829
 will mark a turning point in the story but the circumstances are 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:41.060
 others and the city is in decline 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.880
 know the ins and outs of rimsky 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.060
 as we have said our story tells us how a futuristic city 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.000
 already in decline when the water level forces it to change its position in the 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.769
 ocean for later 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:57.469
 will be taking refugees from the continents as the years pass 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.580
 More and more people are arriving from abroad to Argentine 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.110
 creating barriers foreign to the original area causing the situation 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.180
 be unsustainable 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.920
 and that two sides be formed the resistance and the security forces 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.320
 of the arch 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.450
 is a first person shooter game based on classes 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.710
 where each player 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.940
 will adopt a different but vital role to the success of the missions that 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.420
 they will have to meet the rest of their team at each level of the title 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.580
 once we have selected the side we want to support 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.370
 It's time to teach our characters by countless 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.370
 facial features and clothing from the race 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.909
 scars his beard his tattoos and his complexion 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.530
 and even if it is equipped with synthetic clothing or broken hat helmets 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.190
 cups and a great etcetera 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.980
 all these features will not affect the gameplay 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.659
 but they are to customize 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.110
 and make unique characters 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.039
 instead we will have four classes in this fire that will and will end 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:59.650
 our way of playing 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.570
 these are the soldier the engineer the doctor and the spy 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.270
 the soldier class is the most offensive of the game 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.649
 has the best defenses different types of throwing weapons 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:14.299
 can put bubbles to tear down walls and replenish the ammunition that others 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:15.369
 allies 

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:16.300
 the doctor 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.350
 he is responsible for curing his companions to resurrect the dejected 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.320
 he can heal himself 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.290
 and gives the team better provisionals as they run faster they have bonuses 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.079
 for a few seconds 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:29.030
 the engineer is capable of enhancing 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.669
 the weapons of the companions 

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:33.559
 can plant and deactivate proximity mines 

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:37.369
 put sentinel towers I will go for different objectives of the mission is 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:38.899
 by last 

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:41.289
 the spy serves as support for the rest of the team 

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:43.160
 detecting the united nations 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.189
 locating the enemies on the radar 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:46.239
 and on screen 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.459
 hacking electronic systems 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.829
 and finally disguise himself as any of the fallen rivals 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:55.919
 a characteristic common to all classes is their ability to move 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:03:00.759
 nimbly through the stages doing box to help auster positions more 

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:01.379
 Quick 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.359
 stop for unexpected areas 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:04.369
 the time star ' 

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:06.730
 the game is divided into three campaign modes 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.609
 free fire and challenges 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:11.859
 in any of these three modes we will get experience 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:15.340
 it depends on different factors as if we defeated the enemies with 

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:17.369
 shots to the head or with grenades 

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:18.789
 if we finish it 

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:20.680
 or the ones that was more compensating 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.069
 supporting our team 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.229
 either charging an ally replenishing its ammunition or protecting an area 

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:27.959
 all together 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.349
 This experience is used to unlock new accessories for 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.619
 customize our character and also when leveling up get 

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:39.289
 level credits that allow us to buy general skills or 

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:42.249
 specific to each class for us 

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:46.750
 these skills as well as weapons are important for the gameplay 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.370
 and they make the same map 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.310
 I changed the way I played depending on the skill level of 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.619
 participants 

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:56.989
 the weapons have to be obtained within the challenges mode fulfilling some requirements 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:02.819
 challenges is a game mode for one or several players independent of the 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.169
 plot that will not serve as preparation for campaign mode 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:09.769
 It is advisable to play him since not only do they teach us the different 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:10.889
 game mechanics 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:14.239
 what objectives can arise us and what are the most common situations 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:15.599
 for each class 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:19.679
 if not to overcome them with good score does not reward as has already been 

00:04:19.679 --> 00:04:22.679
 said with unlockable weapons and gives us experience 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.620
 the campaign mode has two frames one for the security forces and another 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.280
 for revolutionaries, each level is a different mission that has 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.850
 alternative objectives 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.520
 that facilitates the achievement 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.469
 the main objective 

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:40.159
 how are they conquer command centers where we can change class or recover 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:43.159
 supplies create shortcuts to attack the opposing side 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:44.759
 or vice versa 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:48.770
 defend key points of the levels so that they are not won by the enemy 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.440
 the free game mode is a way in which we can play these same 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.180
 levels 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.560
 with limitations imposed by the server 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.600
 in principle brink sports a unique and distinguishable design with characters 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.069
 horse between the magazine and what habitat urizar or 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:04.740
 with long and very marked faces 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.190
 and two completely different styles of decoration, such as 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.030
 power slums of the revolutionaries and the high-tech areas of the 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.469
 security forces 

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:17.490
 however, all this is stained by visual problems such as appearance 

00:05:17.489 --> 00:05:19.249
 sudden of the characters 

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:21.710
 I run textures in front of our eyes 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:22.629
 in general 

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:25.330
 an intermediate page rate 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.020
 to this we must add before certain points they make that live enemies do not 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.249
 be visible on the screen making it unplayable 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:37.550
 similar only problems with the sound first the characters in the plot 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.150
 has a selection of voices that is not suitable for them since many of 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.389
 they are too sharp for such warlike and hard characters 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:46.080
 and second 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.910
 in certain occasions most of the audio disappears 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.670
 causing much disorientation in the main player is a young collaboration 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.670
 so those interested should keep in mind that they can not go alone 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.080
 mapped trying to attack enemies 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.280
 since the game is designed so that the team supports each other 

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:07.609
 most of the failures in the missions are given by the bad 

00:06:07.609 --> 00:06:09.020
 team coordination 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.100
 in fact the son himself reminds us constantly 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.089
 that we play as a team and we are rewarded for it 

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:16.130
 in this way 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:20.530
 all those fans and other style of shooting games should consider if 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.309
 acquire this title not 

00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:25.990
 users accustomed to jose collaboration with reasons for three 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.520
 it was something similar destiny of the money 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.080
 with interesting developments in the gameplay 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.830
 but which are sold are governed by the irregular technical section 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.750
 that oscillates between the good finish of the characters but insufficient 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:39.770
 scenarios 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:40.900
 play with pops 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.880
 it is not advisable either because the allies do not help and the enemies seem 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.369
 always have an advantage 

00:06:46.369 --> 00:06:50.139
 This game is made so that players play with each other with the mode 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:50.779
 on-line 

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:53.779
 and the improvement is noticeable 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.879
 It is a very unique title 

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:59.119
 focused on repeating the campaign with different teams of online players 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.879
 and whose main incentive is to customize with weapons 

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:03.949
 skills 

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:06.360
 and specific clothes our characters 

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.500
 People who can not stand playing as a team should not think of toasts as 

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:11.710
 your next game 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:13.150
 while another audience 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:14.419
 especially in pc 

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:18.210
 should consider this interesting alternative to see the fruits of the 

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:18.759
 current panorama
