somebody<00:00:56.190> out<00:00:56.250> goo<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:57.149> actually<00:00:57.629> etched<00:00:57.809> into

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
the plastic all the way through so where

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.090 
the plastic all the way through so where
you<00:01:00.719> see<00:01:00.780> all<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.109> black<00:01:01.469> stuff<00:01:01.800> it's<00:01:01.980> not

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
you see all this black stuff it's not

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.799 
you see all this black stuff it's not
just<00:01:02.340> black<00:01:02.579> painted<00:01:03.149> on<00:01:03.300> there<00:01:03.570> it's

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
just black painted on there it's

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.770 
just black painted on there it's
actually<00:01:04.320> grooved<00:01:04.769> into<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:06.299> plastic

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
actually grooved into the plastic

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.090 
actually grooved into the plastic
throughout<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.140> whole<00:01:07.350> thing<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:07.950> think

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
throughout the whole thing so I think

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.570 
throughout the whole thing so I think
that's<00:01:08.400> really<00:01:08.760> badass<00:01:10.010> where<00:01:11.010> it's<00:01:11.130> red<00:01:11.400> it's

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
that's really badass where it's red it's

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.580 
that's really badass where it's red it's
just<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.820> solid<00:01:12.210> red<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.990> black<00:01:13.170> parts<00:01:13.470> are

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
just a solid red and the black parts are

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.530 
just a solid red and the black parts are
solid<00:01:14.010> black<00:01:14.159> there's<00:01:14.490> not<00:01:14.670> really<00:01:14.939> any<00:01:15.180> paint

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
solid black there's not really any paint

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.460 
solid black there's not really any paint
detailing<00:01:16.229> um<00:01:16.890> it's<00:01:17.520> just<00:01:17.610> black<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:17.939> red<00:01:18.470> the

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
detailing um it's just black and red the

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.539 
detailing um it's just black and red the
reason<00:01:19.680> why<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:19.799> like<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.130> spider-man

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
reason why I like the spider-man

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.249 
reason why I like the spider-man
classics<00:01:20.880> version<00:01:21.420> more<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.689> because<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.020> does

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
classics version more is because it does

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.899 
classics version more is because it does
have<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.439> lot<00:01:22.650> more<00:01:22.680> pink<00:01:23.009> detailing<00:01:23.549> involved

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
have a lot more pink detailing involved

have a lot more pink detailing involved

weird I think it's like it seems like

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.360 
weird I think it's like it seems like
the<00:03:31.870> plastic<00:03:32.350> is<00:03:32.470> different<00:03:32.950> like<00:03:33.070> on<00:03:33.250> the

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
the plastic is different like on the

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.070 
the plastic is different like on the
torso<00:03:33.640> and<00:03:33.910> crotch<00:03:34.180> area<00:03:34.540> than<00:03:34.720> the<00:03:34.810> rest<00:03:34.990> of

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
torso and crotch area than the rest of

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.540 
torso and crotch area than the rest of
the<00:03:35.170> figure<00:03:35.440> I<00:03:35.650> know<00:03:36.100> if<00:03:36.160> you<00:03:36.250> could<00:03:36.370> see

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
the figure I know if you could see

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.370 
the figure I know if you could see
through<00:03:36.700> the<00:03:36.730> camera<00:03:37.090> but<00:03:37.240> it's<00:03:37.360> like<00:03:37.510> like

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
through the camera but it's like like

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.810 
through the camera but it's like like
shiny<00:03:38.709> and<00:03:38.950> a<00:03:38.980> lot<00:03:39.100> more<00:03:39.130> reflective<00:03:39.580> and

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
shiny and a lot more reflective and

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.510 
shiny and a lot more reflective and
glossy<00:03:40.360> on<00:03:40.810> this<00:03:41.320> torso<00:03:41.590> area<00:03:42.040> compared<00:03:42.430> to

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
glossy on this torso area compared to

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.760 
glossy on this torso area compared to
like<00:03:42.640> the<00:03:42.790> leg<00:03:43.000> or<00:03:43.270> arms<00:03:43.570> or<00:03:43.750> head<00:03:43.900> no<00:03:44.560> no<00:03:44.709> I

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
like the leg or arms or head no no I

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.830 
like the leg or arms or head no no I
thought<00:03:44.890> that<00:03:44.950> was<00:03:45.070> kinda<00:03:45.340> neat<00:03:45.430> or<00:03:46.150> not<00:03:46.600> kind

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
thought that was kinda neat or not kind

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.970 
thought that was kinda neat or not kind
of<00:03:46.900> neat<00:03:46.990> just<00:03:47.260> something<00:03:47.530> worth<00:03:47.650> pointing

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
of neat just something worth pointing

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.220 
of neat just something worth pointing
out<00:03:48.450> actually<00:03:49.450> it's<00:03:49.720> not<00:03:49.840> really<00:03:50.080> worth

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
out actually it's not really worth

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.390 
out actually it's not really worth
pointing<00:03:50.500> out<00:03:50.590> okay<00:03:50.920> so<00:03:50.980> here's<00:03:51.310> the

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
pointing out okay so here's the

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.090 
pointing out okay so here's the
spider-man<00:03:52.390> classics<00:03:52.600> version<00:03:53.140> that<00:03:53.830> I<00:03:53.860> do

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
spider-man classics version that I do

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.530 
spider-man classics version that I do
like<00:03:54.400> more<00:03:55.020> I<00:03:56.580> like<00:03:57.580> this<00:03:57.700> painting<00:03:58.000> tailing<00:03:58.450> a

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
like more I like this painting tailing a

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.880 
like more I like this painting tailing a
lot<00:03:59.040> so<00:04:00.040> basically<00:04:00.810> see<00:04:01.810> just<00:04:02.020> comparing<00:04:02.770> it

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
lot so basically see just comparing it

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.130 
lot so basically see just comparing it
to<00:04:02.920> the<00:04:03.100> two<00:04:03.250> of<00:04:03.370> them<00:04:03.459> like<00:04:03.610> this<00:04:03.790> you<00:04:04.140> know

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
to the two of them like this you know

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.380 
to the two of them like this you know
you<00:04:05.200> can<00:04:05.290> see<00:04:05.560> that<00:04:05.709> it's<00:04:05.980> not<00:04:06.190> so<00:04:06.910> defined

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
you can see that it's not so defined

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.199 
you can see that it's not so defined
like<00:04:08.170> basically<00:04:08.860> where<00:04:09.070> it's<00:04:09.220> solid<00:04:09.670> red<00:04:09.910> over

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
like basically where it's solid red over

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.750 
like basically where it's solid red over
here<00:04:10.239> it's<00:04:10.810> red<00:04:11.380> with<00:04:11.620> a<00:04:11.650> black<00:04:11.920> fade<00:04:12.430> and

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
here it's red with a black fade and

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.240 
here it's red with a black fade and
where<00:04:13.630> it's<00:04:13.780> solid<00:04:14.140> black<00:04:14.410> over<00:04:14.739> here<00:04:14.770> it's

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
where it's solid black over here it's

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.420 
where it's solid black over here it's
just<00:04:15.340> a<00:04:15.520> solid<00:04:15.880> red<00:04:16.500> so<00:04:17.500> I<00:04:17.530> like<00:04:17.859> I<00:04:18.070> like<00:04:18.280> this

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
just a solid red so I like I like this

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.099 
just a solid red so I like I like this
paint<00:04:18.730> job<00:04:18.910> a<00:04:18.940> lot<00:04:19.209> more<00:04:19.419> and<00:04:19.570> even<00:04:19.690> like<00:04:19.989> the

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
paint job a lot more and even like the

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:21.570 
paint job a lot more and even like the
ball<00:04:20.320> joints<00:04:20.650> right<00:04:20.739> here<00:04:20.950> on<00:04:21.040> the<00:04:21.130> legs<00:04:21.310> this

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
ball joints right here on the legs this

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.000 
ball joints right here on the legs this
is<00:04:21.640> painted<00:04:22.150> with<00:04:22.479> black<00:04:22.720> on<00:04:22.960> it<00:04:23.110> and<00:04:23.290> even<00:04:23.919> on

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
is painted with black on it and even on

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.860 
is painted with black on it and even on
the<00:04:24.100> shoulder<00:04:24.430> joint<00:04:24.669> right<00:04:24.790> here<00:04:24.850> this<00:04:25.720> is

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
the shoulder joint right here this is

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.150 
the shoulder joint right here this is
this<00:04:26.320> has<00:04:26.470> black<00:04:26.710> paint<00:04:26.979> on

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
this has black paint on

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.400 
this has black paint on
whereas<00:04:27.430> these<00:04:27.640> are<00:04:27.700> just<00:04:28.060> solid<00:04:28.300> red<00:04:28.660> so<00:04:29.380> I

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
whereas these are just solid red so I

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:30.870 
whereas these are just solid red so I
thought<00:04:29.620> this<00:04:29.740> is<00:04:29.890> a<00:04:29.920> lot<00:04:30.190> more<00:04:30.220> detailed

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
thought this is a lot more detailed

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.390 
thought this is a lot more detailed
paint<00:04:31.600> job<00:04:31.840> I<00:04:32.110> like<00:04:32.560> it<00:04:32.710> more<00:04:32.860> and<00:04:33.010> I<00:04:33.100> do<00:04:33.160> like

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
paint job I like it more and I do like

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.280 
paint job I like it more and I do like
the<00:04:33.550> head<00:04:33.700> sculpt<00:04:34.060> more<00:04:34.240> -<00:04:34.450> it's<00:04:34.990> a<00:04:35.050> longer

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
the head sculpt more - it's a longer

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
the head sculpt more - it's a longer
bigger<00:04:35.650> head<00:04:36.060> no<00:04:37.060> no<00:04:37.270> I<00:04:37.510> like<00:04:38.230> it<00:04:38.260> this<00:04:38.980> isn't<00:04:39.250> a

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
bigger head no no I like it this isn't a

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.730 
bigger head no no I like it this isn't a
bad<00:04:39.490> figure<00:04:39.730> either<00:04:40.120> but<00:04:40.660> you<00:04:41.500> know<00:04:41.620> just

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
bad figure either but you know just

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.790 
bad figure either but you know just
comparing<00:04:42.160> the<00:04:42.220> two<00:04:42.400> head<00:04:42.580> scopes<00:04:43.740> kind<00:04:44.740> of

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
comparing the two head scopes kind of

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.990 
comparing the two head scopes kind of
remember<00:04:45.010> carnage<00:04:45.310> looking<00:04:45.550> a<00:04:45.670> little<00:04:45.910> bit

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000
