00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.540 
I have a trick for you guys because I
noticed<00:01:35.960> that<00:01:36.020> it's<00:01:36.230> actually<00:01:36.740> easier<00:01:36.950> if<00:01:37.370> you

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
noticed that it's actually easier if you

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.070 
noticed that it's actually easier if you
take<00:01:37.820> the<00:01:38.060> one<00:01:38.270> side<00:01:38.540> that<00:01:38.750> you've<00:01:38.840> caught

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
take the one side that you've caught

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.590 
take the one side that you've caught
already<00:01:39.380> and<00:01:39.650> flip<00:01:39.980> it<00:01:40.010> over<00:01:40.370> to<00:01:41.300> the<00:01:41.330> side

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
already and flip it over to the side

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.720 
already and flip it over to the side
that<00:01:41.720> you<00:01:41.870> haven't<00:01:42.260> cut<00:01:42.470> and<00:01:42.770> that<00:01:43.310> way<00:01:43.490> it'll

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:43.730 
that you haven't cut and that way it'll

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.270 
that you haven't cut and that way it'll
ensure<00:01:44.240> that<00:01:44.570> the<00:01:44.870> length<00:01:45.350> is<00:01:45.590> exactly<00:01:46.070> the

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
ensure that the length is exactly the

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.560 
ensure that the length is exactly the
same

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
same

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.590 
same
okay<00:01:48.200> so<00:01:48.260> after<00:01:48.620> you've<00:01:48.920> cut<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:50.000> pants<00:01:50.300> they

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
okay so after you've cut the pants they

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.240 
okay so after you've cut the pants they
should<00:01:50.810> look<00:01:50.990> something<00:01:51.290> along<00:01:51.680> the<00:01:51.800> lines<00:01:52.040> of

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
should look something along the lines of

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.820 
should look something along the lines of
shorts<00:01:52.760> and<00:01:52.940> or<00:01:53.360> capris<00:01:54.290> whatever<00:01:54.680> you're

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
shorts and or capris whatever you're

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.500 
shorts and or capris whatever you're
making<00:01:54.920> them<00:01:55.190> into<00:01:55.490> and<00:01:55.760> now<00:01:56.060> the<00:01:56.120> next<00:01:56.360> step

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
making them into and now the next step

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.390 
making them into and now the next step
is<00:01:56.750> to<00:01:56.930> just<00:01:56.960> try<00:01:57.380> them<00:01:57.500> on<00:01:57.650> and<00:01:57.980> to<00:01:58.220> make<00:01:58.370> sure

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
is to just try them on and to make sure

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.250 
is to just try them on and to make sure
that<00:01:58.610> the<00:01:58.910> length<00:01:59.060> is<00:01:59.300> where<00:01:59.480> you<00:01:59.690> want<00:01:59.960> it<00:02:00.110> to

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
that the length is where you want it to

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.400 
that the length is where you want it to
be<00:02:00.410> and<00:02:00.650> if<00:02:01.100> it's<00:02:01.310> either<00:02:01.700> too<00:02:01.970> long<00:02:02.210> um

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
be and if it's either too long um

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.620 
be and if it's either too long um
then<00:02:04.010> you<00:02:04.130> really<00:02:04.430> wanted<00:02:04.730> it<00:02:04.820> to<00:02:04.850> be<00:02:05.000> then<00:02:05.540> you

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
then you really wanted it to be then you

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.000 
then you really wanted it to be then you
could<00:02:05.780> just<00:02:05.930> you<00:02:06.080> know<00:02:06.110> cut<00:02:06.470> off<00:02:06.620> a<00:02:06.650> little<00:02:06.890> bit

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
could just you know cut off a little bit

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.760 
could just you know cut off a little bit
more<00:02:07.070> but<00:02:07.370> remember<00:02:07.760> to<00:02:07.940> keep<00:02:08.320> seam<00:02:09.320> allowance

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
more but remember to keep seam allowance

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.080 
more but remember to keep seam allowance
in<00:02:09.920> mind<00:02:10.100> so<00:02:10.310> you<00:02:10.369> might<00:02:10.610> think<00:02:10.640> that<00:02:10.970> they're

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
in mind so you might think that they're

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.910 
in mind so you might think that they're
a<00:02:11.120> little<00:02:11.300> bit<00:02:11.480> too<00:02:11.600> long<00:02:11.750> now<00:02:12.020> but<00:02:12.590> if<00:02:12.740> you

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
a little bit too long now but if you

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.340 
a little bit too long now but if you
fold<00:02:13.700> it<00:02:13.850> under<00:02:14.210> a<00:02:14.240> little<00:02:14.450> bit<00:02:14.720> to<00:02:15.020> see<00:02:15.200> where

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
fold it under a little bit to see where

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.960 
fold it under a little bit to see where
the<00:02:15.470> seam<00:02:15.710> would<00:02:15.890> be<00:02:16.100> and<00:02:16.310> then<00:02:16.670> you<00:02:16.790> might

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
the seam would be and then you might

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.520 
the seam would be and then you might
realize<00:02:17.120> oh<00:02:17.450> it<00:02:17.600> is<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:17.900> right<00:02:18.080> length<00:02:18.110> that<00:02:18.470> I

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
realize oh it is the right length that I

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.380 
realize oh it is the right length that I
really<00:02:18.860> want<00:02:19.070> it<00:02:19.160> to<00:02:19.280> be<00:02:19.430> so<00:02:19.670> just<00:02:20.209> make<00:02:20.360> sure

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
really want it to be so just make sure

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.690 
really want it to be so just make sure
to<00:02:20.630> keep<00:02:20.780> that<00:02:20.840> in<00:02:21.020> mind<00:02:21.350> okay<00:02:21.709> so<00:02:22.190> once<00:02:22.550> you

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700

is you know if you're a beginner at
sewing<00:02:53.630> I<00:02:53.810> would<00:02:53.959> suggest<00:02:54.170> using<00:02:54.739> pins<00:02:55.250> and

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
sewing I would suggest using pins and

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.430 
sewing I would suggest using pins and
marking<00:02:56.120> it<00:02:56.209> where<00:02:56.420> you<00:02:56.570> want<00:02:56.750> a<00:02:56.810> hem<00:02:56.989> but<00:02:57.230> I'm

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
marking it where you want a hem but I'm

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.900 
marking it where you want a hem but I'm
not<00:02:57.560> gonna<00:02:57.709> bother<00:02:57.920> with<00:02:58.130> that<00:02:58.340> it<00:02:58.489> takes<00:02:58.730> too

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
not gonna bother with that it takes too

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.270 
not gonna bother with that it takes too
long<00:02:58.959> in<00:02:59.959> my<00:03:00.140> opinion<00:03:00.500> but<00:03:00.650> if<00:03:00.890> you<00:03:01.070> are

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
long in my opinion but if you are

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.400
