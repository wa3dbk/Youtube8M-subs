now if I work on my reading of my ear
training<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.470> lot<00:01:37.619> maybe<00:01:38.220> my<00:01:38.430> technique<00:01:38.880> is

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
training a lot maybe my technique is

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.999 
training a lot maybe my technique is
going<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.240> come<00:01:39.450> down<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.720> little<00:01:40.020> bit<00:01:40.290> but

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
going to come down a little bit but

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.859 
going to come down a little bit but
that's<00:01:41.100> not<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.369> bad<00:01:41.610> thing<00:01:41.640> it's<00:01:42.450> better<00:01:42.720> to

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
that's not a bad thing it's better to

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.480 
that's not a bad thing it's better to
have<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.079> where<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.409> have<00:01:43.560> evenness<00:01:44.159> across

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
have it where you have evenness across

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.550 
have it where you have evenness across
your<00:01:44.729> strong<00:01:45.180> musician<00:01:45.659> on<00:01:45.750> all<00:01:45.899> levels<00:01:46.140> and

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
your strong musician on all levels and

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.620 
your strong musician on all levels and
from<00:01:47.040> there<00:01:47.280> on<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.700> all<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.299> music<00:01:48.420> that

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
from there on in all of the music that

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.960 
from there on in all of the music that
you<00:01:48.840> play<00:01:48.869> should<00:01:49.770> engage<00:01:49.890> all<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.549> these<00:01:50.729> and

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
you play should engage all of these and

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.179 
you play should engage all of these and
your<00:01:51.240> ability<00:01:51.659> will<00:01:51.840> grow<00:01:52.110> across<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.950> board

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
your ability will grow across the board

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.219 
your ability will grow across the board
I'll<00:01:53.460> maybe<00:01:54.149> do<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.390> video<00:01:54.600> on<00:01:54.720> putting<00:01:55.110> all

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
I'll maybe do a video on putting all

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.499 
I'll maybe do a video on putting all
that<00:01:55.259> together<00:01:55.560> but<00:01:56.310> for<00:01:56.520> nye<00:01:56.670> that's<00:01:57.329> what

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
that together but for nye that's what

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.369 
that together but for nye that's what
you<00:01:57.570> need<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.780> practice<00:01:58.229> two<00:01:59.189> minutes
