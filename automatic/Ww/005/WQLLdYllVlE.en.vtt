00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:17.730
 hello, let's add our collection 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:20.760
 take origami knife 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.860
 a4 color single-sided paper 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.779
 we will need half a sheet 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.779
 fold our leaf along 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:39.730
 fold and fold the excess part 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.730
 cut off 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:00.300
 we only need this part of us 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.460
 there will be a white knife blade black handle 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.270
 therefore we fold colored paper 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.270
 side inside 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.300
 reveal leaf 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.480
 now turn this side 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:31.830
 let's bend down to the center line 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:36.020
 triangle and here again this side to 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.020
 center line 2 triangles 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.930
 turn the leaf we need the top 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.230
 bend narrow strip of a width of one 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.230
 centimeter 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:06.060
 see translation in this part reveal 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.150
 paper this triangle pushes 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.150
 inside 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.360
 so it should turn out 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:26.000
 we fold our stock in half 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.000
 and therefore the edge from bending the paper 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.230
 reveal again 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.200
 now we have to place this strip 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.780
 paper in the pocket that made a little 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:49.780
 earlier 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:52.870
 fix the strip we smooth the paper on 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:57.250
 a distance of 7 centimeters from the edge set 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:00.569
 control point is now at this point 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.569
 raise the paper up 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:14.140
 diagonal to has passed with us again and 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:15.810
 bend the paper up to get 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:20.580
 such a figure 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:25.690
 these lines 2 we have item item line 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:29.130
 let's work them out well now 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:33.180
 open the paper and on the first line 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.180
 push paper inside 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.620
 and 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:57.120
 here look and on 2 diagonal you again 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.120
 forcing paper 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.069
 It should be such a preparation in 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:10.480
 this corner 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:13.519
 I bend down a small triangle down 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.950
 small and fold this one here 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:19.810
 rectangle in half that is this 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.810
 vodka side you molt 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.720
 fold and wrap the paper away 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.420
 we bend over this line the paper 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.420
 backwards 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:47.729
 do in this corner a little clogged 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:50.400
 here's his little triangle 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:53.220
 sprained 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:58.110
 on this line of black we turn 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:59.759
 make paper fold up and now 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:12.360
 hiding here in this pocket 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:13.530
 look at our corner of paper again 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.930
 this piece of paper 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.530
 should fit in this pocket 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:23.600
 so that the handle of our knife is not collapsed 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.600
 here I am neatly red there 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.230
 and 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.880
 and 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.880
 Here we have such a beautiful knife
