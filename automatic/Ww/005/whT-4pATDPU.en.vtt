bit<00:00:15.809> coded<00:00:16.320> I<00:00:17.300> have<00:00:18.300> it<00:00:18.449> with<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.840> hood<00:00:20.000> you

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
bit coded I have it with the hood you

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.849 
bit coded I have it with the hood you
can<00:00:21.029> see<00:00:22.939> looks<00:00:23.939> quite<00:00:24.269> beautiful<00:00:24.680> with<00:00:25.680> the

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
can see looks quite beautiful with the

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.919 
can see looks quite beautiful with the
hood<00:00:27.740> this<00:00:28.740> doesn't<00:00:29.250> come<00:00:29.519> with<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.449> perches

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
hood this doesn't come with the perches

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.930 
hood this doesn't come with the perches
you'll<00:00:31.140> have<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.410> buy<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.650> separately<00:00:34.670> to<00:00:35.670> very

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
you'll have to buy it separately to very

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:43.490 
you'll have to buy it separately to very
small<00:00:36.420> compact<00:00:36.899> lens<00:00:41.870> let's<00:00:42.870> compare<00:00:43.320> the

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
small compact lens let's compare the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.369 
small compact lens let's compare the
size<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.340> lens<00:00:44.640> with<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.180> lens<00:00:45.750> cap<00:00:46.020> and

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
size of the lens with the lens cap and

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.479 
size of the lens with the lens cap and
you<00:00:46.680> can<00:00:46.890> see<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.450> landscape<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:49.489> quite

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
you can see the landscape is quite

00:00:50.489 --> 00:01:03.580 
you can see the landscape is quite
bigger<00:00:51.059> than<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.629> pollution<00:00:52.620> lens

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:09.789 

this<00:01:04.220> is<00:01:04.400> the<00:01:04.580> coding<00:01:04.940> six<00:01:05.210> bit<00:01:05.390> coding<00:01:08.650> it<00:01:09.650> has

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
this is the coding six bit coding it has

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:18.820 
this is the coding six bit coding it has
nice<00:01:10.040> aperture<00:01:10.520> clicks<00:01:16.990> it<00:01:17.990> has<00:01:18.140> ten<00:01:18.409> aperture

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
nice aperture clicks it has ten aperture

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.219 
nice aperture clicks it has ten aperture
blades<00:01:19.180> so<00:01:20.180> the<00:01:20.330> book<00:01:20.509> K<00:01:20.690> will<00:01:20.840> be<00:01:20.990> quite

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
blades so the book K will be quite

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:30.639 
blades so the book K will be quite
rounded<00:01:26.200> and<00:01:28.360> there's<00:01:29.360> a<00:01:29.420> half<00:01:29.600> stop<00:01:29.930> gap

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
rounded and there's a half stop gap

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:37.930 
rounded and there's a half stop gap
between<00:01:30.830> the<00:01:31.220> each<00:01:31.430> aperture<00:01:36.520> it<00:01:37.520> has<00:01:37.700> eight

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
between the each aperture it has eight

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.320 
between the each aperture it has eight
elements<00:01:38.330> in<00:01:38.630> six<00:01:38.869> groups<00:01:39.200> and<00:01:39.880> it<00:01:40.880> has<00:01:41.030> one<00:01:41.300> a

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
elements in six groups and it has one a

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.310 
elements in six groups and it has one a
spherical<00:01:41.810> element<00:01:43.090> it<00:01:44.090> weights<00:01:44.390> about<00:01:44.659> 170

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
spherical element it weights about 170

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.740 
spherical element it weights about 170
gram<00:01:46.630> it's<00:01:47.630> very<00:01:47.990> small<00:01:48.409> lightweight<00:01:48.860> lens<00:01:49.750> so

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
gram it's very small lightweight lens so

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.210 
gram it's very small lightweight lens so
if<00:01:50.869> you<00:01:51.020> are<00:01:51.080> using<00:01:51.289> it<00:01:51.560> for<00:01:51.590> street

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
if you are using it for street

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.910 
if you are using it for street
photography<00:01:52.659> it<00:01:53.659> is<00:01:53.899> very<00:01:54.229> lightweight<00:01:54.470> and

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
photography it is very lightweight and

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.999 
photography it is very lightweight and
it<00:01:55.340> will<00:01:55.520> be<00:01:55.670> quite<00:01:56.360> joy<00:01:57.259> to<00:01:57.530> carry<00:01:57.770> it<00:01:57.890> around

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
it will be quite joy to carry it around

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:04.800 
it will be quite joy to carry it around
whole<00:01:58.520> day<00:02:00.220> even<00:02:01.220> if<00:02:01.340> you<00:02:02.200> shoot<00:02:03.200> with<00:02:03.229> F<00:02:03.740> 2.8

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
whole day even if you shoot with F 2.8

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.150 
whole day even if you shoot with F 2.8
you<00:02:05.810> will<00:02:05.990> have<00:02:06.200> a<00:02:06.229> distortion<00:02:06.860> free<00:02:07.250> image<00:02:07.720> it

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
you will have a distortion free image it

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.940 
you will have a distortion free image it
performs<00:02:10.160> quite<00:02:10.729> nice<00:02:11.510> it's<00:02:11.900> very<00:02:12.290> nice<00:02:12.769> lens

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
performs quite nice it's very nice lens

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.650 
performs quite nice it's very nice lens
this<00:02:15.950> very<00:02:16.310> sharp<00:02:16.640> even<00:02:17.120> at<00:02:17.420> F<00:02:17.630> 2.8<00:02:19.209> can<00:02:20.209> go<00:02:20.420> all

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
this very sharp even at F 2.8 can go all

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.530 
this very sharp even at F 2.8 can go all
the<00:02:20.690> way<00:02:20.930> up<00:02:21.230> to<00:02:21.380> f-22<00:02:22.040> so<00:02:22.940> if<00:02:23.030> you<00:02:23.150> have<00:02:23.269> quite

the way up to f-22 so if you have quite

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.920 
the way up to f-22 so if you have quite
nice<00:02:23.780> light<00:02:24.170> in<00:02:24.470> daytime<00:02:25.540> it<00:02:26.540> can<00:02:26.900> focus<00:02:27.220> from

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
nice light in daytime it can focus from

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.349 
nice light in daytime it can focus from
0.7<00:02:29.930> meter<00:02:30.140> till<00:02:31.070> infinity<00:02:31.250> if<00:02:31.970> you<00:02:32.209> are

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:32.359 
0.7 meter till infinity if you are

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:41.410 
0.7 meter till infinity if you are
shooting<00:02:32.600> it<00:02:32.950> at<00:02:33.950> F<00:02:34.820> 32

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:58.830 

let<00:02:41.930> me<00:02:42.080> show<00:02:42.260> you<00:02:42.319> it<00:02:42.530> on<00:02:42.740> the<00:02:42.890> camera

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.610 

this<00:02:59.440> is<00:02:59.590> how<00:02:59.680> it<00:02:59.860> looks<00:03:00.069> on<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.400> m6<00:03:01.620> it's

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
this is how it looks on the m6 it's

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.960 
this is how it looks on the m6 it's
fairly<00:03:03.069> small<00:03:03.610> lengths<00:03:05.190> if<00:03:06.190> you<00:03:06.340> compare<00:03:06.849> it

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
fairly small lengths if you compare it

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.119 
fairly small lengths if you compare it
with<00:03:07.980> any<00:03:08.980> other<00:03:09.099> lens<00:03:10.319> it's<00:03:11.319> very<00:03:11.590> small<00:03:11.920> lens

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:12.129 
with any other lens it's very small lens

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:16.619 
with any other lens it's very small lens
hope<00:03:12.489> you<00:03:12.610> can<00:03:12.819> see<00:03:13.000> that<00:03:14.819> it<00:03:15.819> does<00:03:16.030> not<00:03:16.060> block

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629 
hope you can see that it does not block

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.619 
hope you can see that it does not block
your<00:03:16.690> viewfinder<00:03:17.790> so<00:03:18.790> if<00:03:18.879> you<00:03:19.030> even<00:03:19.330> if<00:03:19.480> you

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:19.629 
your viewfinder so if you even if you

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:21.660 
your viewfinder so if you even if you
have<00:03:19.870> this<00:03:20.349> lens<00:03:20.590> and<00:03:20.799> if<00:03:21.129> you<00:03:21.280> are<00:03:21.340> looking

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
have this lens and if you are looking

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.320 
have this lens and if you are looking
from<00:03:21.819> here<00:03:22.120> it<00:03:22.690> will<00:03:22.870> not<00:03:23.080> block<00:03:23.500> your<00:03:23.769> view<00:03:24.330> so

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
from here it will not block your view so

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:32.460 
from here it will not block your view so
that's<00:03:25.510> quite<00:03:25.840> nice<00:03:30.630> let<00:03:31.630> me<00:03:31.840> put<00:03:32.049> on<00:03:32.079> the<00:03:32.290> hood

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
that's quite nice let me put on the hood

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.759 
that's quite nice let me put on the hood
and<00:03:32.680> let<00:03:33.010> me<00:03:33.190> show<00:03:33.370> you<00:03:34.260> how<00:03:35.260> does<00:03:35.440> it<00:03:35.590> look
