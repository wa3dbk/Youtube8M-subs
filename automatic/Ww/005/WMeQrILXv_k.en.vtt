Greyhound 11 horse engine runs like a
charm<00:05:15.630> started<00:05:16.290> on<00:05:16.410> the<00:05:16.500> first<00:05:16.740> pole<00:05:17.330> had<00:05:18.330> to

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
charm started on the first pole had to

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.030 
charm started on the first pole had to
run<00:05:18.600> I<00:05:18.630> guess<00:05:18.990> to<00:05:19.140> shut<00:05:19.290> it<00:05:19.410> off<00:05:19.560> because<00:05:19.740> it's

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
run I guess to shut it off because it's

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.420 
run I guess to shut it off because it's
not<00:05:20.250> grounded<00:05:20.700> so<00:05:21.710> so<00:05:22.710> get<00:05:22.830> the<00:05:22.980> electrical

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
not grounded so so get the electrical

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.620 
not grounded so so get the electrical
system<00:05:23.760> and<00:05:23.790> everything<00:05:24.030> hooked<00:05:24.300> up<00:05:24.450> should

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
system and everything hooked up should

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.810
