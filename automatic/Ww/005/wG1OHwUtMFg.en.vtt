00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.609 
games and I've heard of put a purple led
into<00:00:17.250> it<00:00:17.369> but<00:00:18.240> I'm<00:00:18.359> not<00:00:18.480> super<00:00:18.690> satisfied<00:00:19.410> with

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
into it but I'm not super satisfied with

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.480 
into it but I'm not super satisfied with
it<00:00:21.289> doesn't<00:00:22.289> really<00:00:22.470> show<00:00:22.740> up<00:00:22.830> on<00:00:22.920> camera<00:00:23.220> but

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
it doesn't really show up on camera but

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.359 
it doesn't really show up on camera but
it<00:00:23.699> really<00:00:24.029> just<00:00:24.269> looks<00:00:24.570> blue<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.830> look<00:00:26.039> at<00:00:26.220> it

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
it really just looks blue to look at it

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.689 
it really just looks blue to look at it
and<00:00:27.000> it's<00:00:27.810> not<00:00:27.869> diffused<00:00:28.439> so<00:00:28.710> it's<00:00:28.949> it's<00:00:29.429> not

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
and it's not diffused so it's it's not

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.910 
and it's not diffused so it's it's not
extremely<00:00:30.630> visible<00:00:31.019> from<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.439> sides<00:00:31.710> it's

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
extremely visible from the sides it's

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.470 
extremely visible from the sides it's
not<00:00:32.009> as<00:00:32.099> much<00:00:32.250> as<00:00:32.369> from<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.610> top<00:00:32.820> it's<00:00:33.030> super

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
not as much as from the top it's super

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.660 
not as much as from the top it's super
bright<00:00:33.660> top<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.130> can<00:00:35.280> get<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.460> kind<00:00:35.579> of

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
bright top and you can get a kind of

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.380 
bright top and you can get a kind of
idea<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.420> cone<00:00:37.079> shape<00:00:38.059> light<00:00:39.059> coming

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
idea of the a cone shape light coming

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.850 
idea of the a cone shape light coming
out<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.780> from<00:00:39.989> through<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.200> camera<00:00:40.590> but

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
out of it from through the camera but

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.000 
out of it from through the camera but
the<00:00:43.860> actual<00:00:44.100> light<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.640> puts<00:00:44.820> out<00:00:45.000> is

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
the actual light that it puts out is

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.549 
the actual light that it puts out is
purple<00:00:47.780> probably<00:00:48.780> also<00:00:48.989> not<00:00:49.140> showing<00:00:49.410> up<00:00:49.530> very

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
purple probably also not showing up very

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.450 
purple probably also not showing up very
well<00:00:49.920> on<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.160> camera<00:00:51.140> but<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.410> know<00:00:52.949> also<00:00:53.160> it

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
well on the camera but you know also it

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.880 
well on the camera but you know also it
wasn't<00:00:53.640> cheap<00:00:54.230> there's<00:00:55.230> almost<00:00:55.350> two<00:00:55.590> dollars

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
wasn't cheap there's almost two dollars

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.950 
wasn't cheap there's almost two dollars
for<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.190> one<00:00:56.399> LED<00:00:56.789> it's<00:00:57.270> crazy<00:00:57.539> it's<00:00:57.750> hard<00:00:57.899> to

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
for that one LED it's crazy it's hard to

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.990 
for that one LED it's crazy it's hard to
find<00:00:58.170> purple<00:00:58.530> LEDs<00:00:59.300> but<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.390> cool<00:01:00.600> thing<00:01:02.000> you

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
find purple LEDs but the cool thing you

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.299 
find purple LEDs but the cool thing you
sent<00:01:03.210> along<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.390> super<00:01:03.780> Gameboy<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.409> test<00:01:04.799> out<00:01:05.010> I

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
sent along a super Gameboy to test out I

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.219 
sent along a super Gameboy to test out I
have<00:01:05.970> no<00:01:06.090> idea<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.510> these<00:01:06.659> things<00:01:06.990> even

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
have no idea is these things even

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.929 
have no idea is these things even
existed<00:01:08.720> apparently<00:01:09.720> there's<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.930> lot<00:01:09.960> more

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:38.320 

I<00:01:35.920> get<00:01:36.920> four<00:01:37.160> different<00:01:37.250> banks<00:01:37.610> of<00:01:37.850> colors<00:01:38.180> we

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
lame ones and then like a Roman you can

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.720 
lame ones and then like a Roman you can
change<00:02:22.070> the<00:02:22.540> controller<00:02:23.540> type<00:02:24.580> normal<00:02:25.580> and

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
change the controller type normal and

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.590 
change the controller type normal and
then<00:02:26.500> weird<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:31.060> then<00:02:32.060> I<00:02:32.180> don't<00:02:32.360> know<00:02:32.480> what

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
then weird and then I don't know what

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.300 
then weird and then I don't know what
this<00:02:32.720> one<00:02:32.900> does<00:02:32.930> it's<00:02:33.880> beyond<00:02:34.880> me<00:02:36.010> maybe<00:02:37.010> make

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
this one does it's beyond me maybe make

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:45.490 
this one does it's beyond me maybe make
your<00:02:37.430> own<00:02:38.980> color<00:02:39.980> tile<00:02:43.480> and<00:02:44.480> then<00:02:45.140> this<00:02:45.320> last

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
your own color tile and then this last

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.060 
your own color tile and then this last
one<00:02:45.620> you<00:02:45.800> can<00:02:45.830> draw<00:02:46.250> your<00:02:46.460> own<00:02:46.520> background

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070

anyway<00:02:56.400> that's<00:02:56.519> very<00:02:57.450> interesting<00:02:57.840> I<00:02:57.900> didn't

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
anyway that's very interesting I didn't

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.960 
anyway that's very interesting I didn't
know<00:02:58.260> this<00:02:58.379> existed<00:02:58.530> I'm<00:02:59.459> gonna<00:02:59.580> ask<00:02:59.730> the

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970

customer if he actually wants me to

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.949 
customer if he actually wants me to
change<00:03:01.890> that<00:03:02.160> led<00:03:02.849> to<00:03:03.060> match<00:03:03.300> this<00:03:03.540> one<00:03:03.750> since

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
change that led to match this one since
