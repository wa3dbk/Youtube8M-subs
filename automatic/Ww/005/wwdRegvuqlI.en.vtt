we're talking military is the cargo
precision<00:02:13.750> cargo<00:02:14.140> delivery<00:02:14.530> system<00:02:14.980> we

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
precision cargo delivery system we

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.230 
precision cargo delivery system we
developed<00:02:15.910> a<00:02:16.030> system<00:02:16.209> called<00:02:16.599> a<00:02:16.720> screamer<00:02:17.050> and

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
developed a system called a screamer and

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.970 
developed a system called a screamer and
a little<00:02:18.960> story<00:02:19.170> there<00:02:19.380> but<00:02:19.410> I<00:02:19.590> won't<00:02:19.710> get<00:02:19.890> in

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
a little story there but I won't get in

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.520 
a little story there but I won't get in
it<00:02:20.130> and<00:02:20.220> that<00:02:20.310> uses<00:02:20.820> a<00:02:21.000> small<00:02:21.360> ram-air<00:02:21.780> canopy

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
it and that uses a small ram-air canopy

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.670 
it and that uses a small ram-air canopy
that<00:02:22.950> flies<00:02:23.190> very<00:02:23.400> fast<00:02:23.910> it'll<00:02:24.240> fly<00:02:24.500> 120<00:02:25.500> miles

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
that flies very fast it'll fly 120 miles

an hour with a 220 square foot canopy

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.010 
an hour with a 220 square foot canopy
it's<00:02:29.220> about<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.520> size<00:02:29.700> of<00:02:29.910> my<00:02:29.970> reserve<00:02:30.420> but

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
it's about the size of my reserve but

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.680 
it's about the size of my reserve but
2,000<00:02:32.010> pounds<00:02:32.400> hanging<00:02:32.730> underneath<00:02:33.000> it<00:02:33.300> so

2,000 pounds hanging underneath it so

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.810 
2,000 pounds hanging underneath it so
it's<00:02:33.840> plies<00:02:34.080> very<00:02:34.440> fast<00:02:34.710> needless<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.340> say<00:02:35.520> it

it's plies very fast needless to say it

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.970 
it's plies very fast needless to say it
kind<00:02:36.090> of<00:02:36.120> land<00:02:36.360> so<00:02:36.990> well<00:02:37.560> know<00:02:37.650> this<00:02:37.830> sounds

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
kind of land so well know this sounds

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.250 
kind of land so well know this sounds
like<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.250> weight<00:02:38.970> at<00:02:39.540> that<00:02:39.690> point<00:02:39.930> this<00:02:40.020> sounds

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
like a weight at that point this sounds

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.110 
like a weight at that point this sounds
like<00:02:40.320> a<00:02:40.380> new<00:02:40.670> competitive<00:02:41.670> competitive

discipline<00:02:42.630> for<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.870> fai<00:02:43.110> cargo<00:02:43.740> swooping

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
discipline for the fai cargo swooping

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.810 
discipline for the fai cargo swooping
probably<00:02:46.020> good<00:02:46.260> yes<00:02:46.530> hey<00:02:47.220> that<00:02:47.400> guy<00:02:47.580> would<00:02:47.640> go

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
probably good yes hey that guy would go

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.170 
probably good yes hey that guy would go
crashing<00:02:48.360> it<00:02:48.510> right<00:02:49.040> but<00:02:50.040> what<00:02:50.760> happens<00:02:51.120> when

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
crashing it right but what happens when

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.200 
crashing it right but what happens when
it<00:02:51.360> gets<00:02:51.450> low<00:02:51.720> like<00:02:52.110> 800<00:02:52.710> thousand<00:02:53.160> feet<00:02:53.340> it

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
it gets low like 800 thousand feet it

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.150 
it gets low like 800 thousand feet it
transitions<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:55.050> a<00:02:55.170> round<00:02:55.440> parachute<00:02:56.040> and

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
transitions to a round parachute and

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.160 
transitions to a round parachute and
then<00:02:56.580> it's<00:02:56.730> off<00:02:56.940> lands<00:02:57.450> underneath<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:57.990> round

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
then it's off lands underneath the round

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.930 
then it's off lands underneath the round
parachute<00:02:58.680> so<00:02:58.980> it's<00:02:59.100> using<00:02:59.370> two<00:02:59.520> parachutes

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
parachute so it's using two parachutes

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.120 
parachute so it's using two parachutes
or<00:03:00.180> ramming<00:03:00.510> our<00:03:00.570> canopy<00:03:01.050> and<00:03:01.230> a<00:03:01.470> round<00:03:01.680> canopy

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
or ramming our canopy and a round canopy

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.940 
or ramming our canopy and a round canopy
so<00:03:02.490> and<00:03:02.700> that's<00:03:02.880> a<00:03:03.120> unique<00:03:03.840> combination<00:03:04.140> or<00:03:04.770> so

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
so and that's a unique combination or so

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.060 
so and that's a unique combination or so
to<00:03:05.690> you<00:03:06.690> know<00:03:06.780> do<00:03:06.960> that<00:03:07.110> precision<00:03:07.470> delivery

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
to you know do that precision delivery

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.010 
to you know do that precision delivery
now<00:03:08.400> it<00:03:08.490> doesn't<00:03:08.760> cut<00:03:08.880> away<00:03:09.060> that<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:09.450> ram<00:03:09.810> air

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
now it doesn't cut away that the ram air

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.140 
now it doesn't cut away that the ram air
is<00:03:10.230> it<00:03:10.380> deploys<00:03:10.740> the<00:03:10.770> round<00:03:11.040> no<00:03:11.370> it<00:03:11.550> keeps<00:03:11.910> it

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
is it deploys the round no it keeps it

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.510 
is it deploys the round no it keeps it
it<00:03:12.720> actually<00:03:12.930> is<00:03:13.170> used<00:03:13.440> in<00:03:13.620> that<00:03:13.800> that<00:03:14.100> canopy

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
it actually is used in that that canopy

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.500 
it actually is used in that that canopy
as<00:03:14.850> far<00:03:15.120> as<00:03:15.240> letting<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:15.930> round<00:03:16.140> canopy<00:03:17.510> what

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
as far as letting the round canopy what

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.390 
as far as letting the round canopy what
do<00:03:18.570> you<00:03:18.660> call<00:03:18.780> it<00:03:18.840> just<00:03:19.170> a<00:03:19.380> knock<00:03:19.950> canopy

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
do you call it just a knock canopy

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.160 
do you call it just a knock canopy
transfer<00:03:20.910> but<00:03:21.150> close<00:03:21.360> to<00:03:21.390> that<00:03:21.720> okay<00:03:22.080> it<00:03:22.140> just

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
transfer but close to that okay it just

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.900 
transfer but close to that okay it just
trails<00:03:22.620> right<00:03:22.890> out<00:03:23.040> right<00:03:23.250> behind<00:03:23.400> it<00:03:23.760> and

trails right out right behind it and

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.760 
trails right out right behind it and
then<00:03:24.270> it<00:03:24.390> just<00:03:24.540> swings<00:03:24.750> vertical<00:03:24.930> and<00:03:25.320> the<00:03:25.620> ram

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
then it just swings vertical and the ram

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
you do your weight loading on that and

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.840 
you do your weight loading on that and
you're<00:03:48.150> you<00:03:48.420> know<00:03:48.930> 12<00:03:49.320> 14<00:03:49.890> pounds<00:03:50.580> per<00:03:50.820> square
