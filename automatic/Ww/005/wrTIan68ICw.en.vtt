it so the ball is spinning bring you
over<00:01:43.350> here<00:01:43.380> with<00:01:43.679> my<00:01:43.830> spin<00:01:44.159> ball<00:01:45.110> well<00:01:46.110> no<00:01:46.470> it's

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
over here with my spin ball well no it's

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.039 
over here with my spin ball well no it's
my<00:01:46.799> life<00:01:47.009> three<00:01:47.399> dollars<00:01:47.700> already<00:01:47.929> so<00:01:48.929> the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
my life three dollars already so the

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:59.059 
my life three dollars already so the
ball<00:01:49.259> is<00:01:49.409> spinning<00:01:50.990> like<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:54.770> so<00:01:58.069> there's

00:01:59.059 --> 00:01:59.069 
ball is spinning like that so there's

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:03.199 
ball is spinning like that so there's
topspin<00:01:59.810> and<00:02:00.810> there's<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.619> little<00:02:02.520> side<00:02:02.850> spin

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:03.209 
topspin and there's a little side spin

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:06.710 
topspin and there's a little side spin
add<00:02:03.509> those<00:02:03.869> together<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:05.520> get<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:06.060> type

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
add those together and you get that type

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.509 
add those together and you get that type
of<00:02:06.750> spin<00:02:07.200> oh<00:02:08.869> I'll<00:02:09.869> put<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.470> here<00:02:10.519> hopefully

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
of spin oh I'll put it here hopefully

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.360 
of spin oh I'll put it here hopefully
you<00:02:11.609> can<00:02:11.730> see<00:02:12.000> it<00:02:12.530> but<00:02:13.530> I<00:02:13.590> don't<00:02:14.010> think<00:02:14.160> you'll

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
you can see it but I don't think you'll

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.970 
you can see it but I don't think you'll
be<00:02:14.519> able<00:02:14.549> to<00:02:15.290> hopefully<00:02:16.290> you'll<00:02:16.560> be<00:02:16.620> able<00:02:16.799> to

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
be able to hopefully you'll be able to

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.190 
be able to hopefully you'll be able to
see<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.310> spin<00:02:17.549> but<00:02:17.790> don't<00:02:18.750> think<00:02:18.989> you'll<00:02:19.079> be

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
see the spin but don't think you'll be

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.680 
see the spin but don't think you'll be
able<00:02:19.320> to<00:02:19.880> if<00:02:20.880> you<00:02:21.030> can't<00:02:21.180> it'll<00:02:21.390> be<00:02:21.510> pretty

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
able to if you can't it'll be pretty

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.740 
able to if you can't it'll be pretty
cool<00:02:21.930> because<00:02:22.640> see<00:02:23.640> exactly<00:02:24.000> how<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.480> hit

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
cool because see exactly how the hit

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:35.810 
cool because see exactly how the hit
works<00:02:25.730> so<00:02:31.370> this<00:02:32.370> is<00:02:32.400> basically<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:33.209> spin<00:02:34.820> and

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
works so this is basically the spin and

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.650 
works so this is basically the spin and
the<00:02:36.540> head<00:02:36.750> slowly<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:38.010> once<00:02:38.940> you<00:02:39.060> get<00:02:39.180> that<00:02:39.359> it

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
the head slowly and once you get that it

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:48.110 
the head slowly and once you get that it
looks<00:02:39.870> like<00:02:39.959> next<00:02:40.320> full<00:02:40.680> speed<00:02:46.880> not<00:02:47.880> much

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
looks like next full speed not much

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.300 
looks like next full speed not much
different<00:02:48.600> from<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.959> forehand<00:02:49.500> slider<00:02:49.890> but

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
different from the forehand slider but

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.050 
different from the forehand slider but
you<00:02:50.970> are<00:02:51.209> adding<00:02:51.630> a<00:02:51.750> bit<00:02:52.290> of<00:02:52.350> curve<00:02:52.709> to<00:02:52.950> it<00:02:53.060> it's

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
you are adding a bit of curve to it it's

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.610 
you are adding a bit of curve to it it's
not<00:02:54.209> a<00:02:54.269> great<00:02:54.540> kill<00:02:54.870> shot<00:02:55.140> in<00:02:55.350> a<00:02:55.410> match

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
not a great kill shot in a match
