00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.840
 very good to all guys that tele 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.120
 You are welcome to the channel and 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.519
 good as it is this time he plays club tour 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.009
 I'm teaching my March templates 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.620
 so well let's go before 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:15.450
 start making templates remember 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.220
 leave your account and your like to 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.440
 see if we get to those 300 that in the 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.780
 previous video we were very very 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.200
 close so we go with the first 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.730
 template wins skiles 41 and good is that 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.860
 comment that this template is one of 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.810
 the templates that I have not rendered as 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.640
 I expected is a very easy template 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.339
 empathize since we can perfectly 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.760
 put by the left end and by the 

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:40.499
 lateral the ball yes and square can be 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.570
 empathize with me very easy is a 

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:44.159
 template that if you want to start doing 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.289
 skills I only recommend them since it has 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:48.359
 a pretty solid defense in the middle of 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.159
 pretty good field and the front 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:52.890
 We will change tyson for 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:55.350
 chihahua a path that would give us then 6 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.659
 skiles up like that and then we have the 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.210
 kiwi on the bench that minute one 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:02.219
 it would be exchanged for tyson there it is and it 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.809
 would be the said six skiles above 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.850
 which would help us 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.790
 get those great goals 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.380
 I like this template I recommend it 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.000
 panenka on twitter you also have my 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.190
 twitter in the description remember of 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.200
 follow me and good if you really play at 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.330
 win and you like to have fun doing 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.399
 skills this is your template to do 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.409
 a catch what you want because of 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:25.830
 true this template if you play at 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.600
 would win fun is going great now comes 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.340
 one of the most original templates and 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.200
 that I like the most since it is very 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.690
 easy to buy also as we had 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.640
 there to oscar is chemistry between 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.860
 barclays steelers in this case 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.200
 tara and any extreme we could already 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.390
 be it to ben arfa be it majidi either 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.100
 balls and if you want to whom I want to 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.280
 empathize in this template very 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.409
 it is easily worth hoops to give an example 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.869
 but I already say that this template gives very 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.880
 good results and really deserves the 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.759
 It's a pity that we're not overly insole 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.549
 can be had by anyone and 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.899
 I already say that it is great and good as you see 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.990
 here we make the changes would be 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.549
 I would simply change a Brazilian and 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.069
 in the other band then remove Mariano 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.899
 there is no other that really 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.760
 chemistry and little else to say can 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.190
 put sport to dominate already if I say this 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.460
 plant 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.260
 is brutal next template this is not what 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.450
 I use a lot but it really is a good 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.890
 template as you see I have here of 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.660
 iu-greens a player that really 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.430
 I notice good and how is also mccarthy 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.220
 minute one would be exchanged for matÃ­as 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.840
 fernandez is the player who is brutal and 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.280
 little more to say about this template is 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.960
 very similar to the first one that has 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.280
 taught and little else to say goes 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.920
 I recommend it quite well 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.270
 the following template is not for skills 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.880
 but it is a template that 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.890
 I recommend 100 that you try it as you 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.480
 I have de bruijn had tried the one of 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.990
 verin shift and the truth is that this 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.780
 brin 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.520
 for nothing is good is not just a match 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.680
 with him but it has nothing to do 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.450
 with the other bryn I recommend that you 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.120
 you can buy at the beginning in this 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.730
 template is a pass recommended it 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.760
 100% if you play to win and this template 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.740
 as I say it is very funny very good and 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.630
 you are going to win everything 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.250
 this template when the problem is 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.320
 surprised but good as you see is missing and 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.300
 neymar if I have it right now for sale 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.010
 my club is you believe in crisis in case 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.630
 someone wants but this template will 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.120
 very good if you have it so the 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.820
 I recommend and finally we finish this 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.530
 club tour with the best team I have 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.690
 skills right now to make this 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.300
 team is really the best as it is 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.340
 you have a solid defense a midfield 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.560
 solid and a whole wing brutally changing 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.690
 to james by tiyahui or by balls and live 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.690
 in minute one is a team that 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.420
 I really recommend 100 time and good 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.250
 we are going to throw now like these 10 of that 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.920
 we will be now all players 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.900
 that I have in the club I have practically 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.270
 the same and f only that most are from 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.160
 discards and good right now I do not have 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.840
 no player all since they are going down 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.360
 the prices you already know but little more 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.860
 what to say guys is being the club 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.720
 deck I hope you liked how it 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.980
 the teams evolved a lot and little 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.350
 more than saying I hope you liked it 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.820
 the video we go to the next and 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.820
