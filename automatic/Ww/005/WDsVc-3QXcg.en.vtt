00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:04.930 
three but with purples now with Purple's
is<00:02:03.800> going<00:02:03.980> to<00:02:04.040> be<00:02:04.100> tricky<00:02:04.340> because<00:02:04.490> you<00:02:04.670> can't

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
is going to be tricky because you can't

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.250 
is going to be tricky because you can't
hit<00:02:05.180> the<00:02:05.300> wheel<00:02:05.480> routes<00:02:05.720> you're<00:02:05.930> gonna<00:02:06.050> have

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
hit the wheel routes you're gonna have

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260 
hit the wheel routes you're gonna have
to<00:02:06.380> hit<00:02:06.500> that<00:02:06.680> post<00:02:06.950> route<00:02:07.220> again<00:02:07.880> once<00:02:08.149> he

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
to hit that post route again once he

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.430 
to hit that post route again once he
makes<00:02:08.420> his<00:02:08.630> cut<00:02:08.840> but<00:02:08.990> you're<00:02:09.080> going<00:02:09.170> to<00:02:09.230> wait<00:02:09.410> a

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
makes his cut but you're going to wait a

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.430 
makes his cut but you're going to wait a
little<00:02:09.770> longer<00:02:10.720> precision<00:02:11.720> it<00:02:11.840> to<00:02:11.930> about<00:02:12.170> four

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
little longer precision it to about four

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.740 
little longer precision it to about four
o'clock<00:02:12.470> and<00:02:12.980> you<00:02:13.070> wide<00:02:13.310> open<00:02:13.340> again<00:02:13.880> now

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
o'clock and you wide open again now

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.750 
o'clock and you wide open again now
that's<00:02:15.020> also<00:02:15.320> been<00:02:15.470> used<00:02:15.530> we're<00:02:16.100> gonna<00:02:16.190> hit<00:02:16.430> be

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
that's also been used we're gonna hit be

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.520 
that's also been used we're gonna hit be
once<00:02:17.240> he<00:02:17.330> clears<00:02:17.690> all<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.080> zones<00:02:18.200> but<00:02:18.410> it's

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
once he clears all the zones but it's

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.840 
once he clears all the zones but it's
going<00:02:18.620> to<00:02:18.680> be<00:02:18.770> really<00:02:19.040> tricky<00:02:19.400> because<00:02:19.670> you

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
going to be really tricky because you

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.100 
going to be really tricky because you
have<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.180> fit<00:02:20.360> it<00:02:20.480> in<00:02:20.600> there<00:02:20.630> with<00:02:20.900> a<00:02:20.930> good

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
that was a tough pass but you can all

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.760 
that was a tough pass but you can all
but<00:02:25.490> you<00:02:25.580> can<00:02:25.760> make<00:02:25.880> it<00:02:26.380> next<00:02:27.380> deep<00:02:27.470> cuts<00:02:27.650> were
