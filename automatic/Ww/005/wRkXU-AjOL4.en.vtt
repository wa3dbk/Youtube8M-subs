 on such a beautiful 8 bit map game 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:21.869
 history to be honest this card is called 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:26.189

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.829
 deprived us of congratulations they did here 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.600

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.000
 his most detailed on this 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:57.600
 moment tank tank called carls carl 1 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.910
 in the game he is just called carl he 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.050
 600 drank meter cannon and thousands 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.320
 shells imagine 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.260

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.590
 height is not nobody never so was not 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:14.130
 such you sirro plan on the tank she 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.110
 in general in the game so they throw me to devote 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.670
 certainly not me but most likely it is me 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:24.170
 will have to shine so oh all the same landmine 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.390
 finish it off 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.549
 radius beats all the quince there already 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.320
 someone shoots you can buy it as 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:36.990
 on the track hands is called it 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.600
 Artovoda so guys mode pretty 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.159
 cool just you can fuck up 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.540
 pass making money of course much 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.750
 money you do not earn for it give 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.509
 only something five thousand in one battle experience you 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.720
 don't get any songs for you at all 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.950
 you have nothing to free 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.780
 money is also not much possible 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.090
 better better just play your favorite 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.350
 plan tanks and earn more experience 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:04.079
 more experience more silver more 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.450
 all grunge so i'm not another one of ours 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.319
 ally right now kill most likely let's 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.360
 here there is such a mode on a spike called 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.700
 art dealer 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.980
 artillery mode that's shorter so 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.160
 let's take a look in from all sides 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:23.549
 trying to kill . and now i have 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.140
 this one is killed but all the guys i don't know 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:29.310
 probably the second battle will not play 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.190
 of course so simple I don't know what let's 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.170
 probably now we will create a training fight 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.440
 At least I do not know, let's now all the same 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.209
 I 'll probably pause too 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.130
 I will play the second fight or I will be like this 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:45.150
 guys this is us such a greeting from 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:47.760
 Wargaming last year of course was 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.829
 they just zombie mod and announced but 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.220
 They did not enter it, but here you can really 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:57.030
 you can actually play from the tanks 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.190
 play yourself new card new tank yet 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.880
 did not announce such a funny figure 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.940
 like the type 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.620
 with us and without collecting your tank but rather 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.819
 it's just congratulations on April 1st 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:11.430
 they are unlikely to withdraw but the modes were 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.799
 cool and in the planes they are in their 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.200
 time entered 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:18.690
 flying saucers and on old maps then 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.530
 there are on the ordinary cards they have introduced all sorts 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.810
 different us background in different robots 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.829
 airships there Well, actually looks 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:31.680

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:36.329

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:40.859
 On the card, then the card is very honest 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.380
 look like but i'm from as far as i remember she was 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:45.450
 slightly different 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.310
 the most again here is the first battle map 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.270

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.310

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.270

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:27.510
