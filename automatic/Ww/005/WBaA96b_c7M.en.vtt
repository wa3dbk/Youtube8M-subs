00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.679
 had to leave the point fr with that of the news with the captain 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:08.500
 as of the 15th of the chair series hurts his partners so rising percent of 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.789
 Switzerland is doing more to this victory Saturday in doubles 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:15.820
 these macabre goal to zero it is so the super good recently passed us 

00:00:15.819 --> 00:00:19.480
 remind us a little bit of how it happened on the side of the front wall 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.480
 to arrive on the thorn on their field of honor 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:27.249
 first step was postponed 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:30.130
 social openness 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.569
 in his speech 

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:34.250
 for the publisher 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.830
 on a center of the entrance 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.510
 and for this race 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.750
 from goal to 0 at half-time was stronger than the drop in demand the 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.510
 we know that only one victory 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.520
 we would therefore be enough for many people to have a say in our 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.520
 heads how is it going 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.320
 she messed up 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.310
 business to follow goal 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.220
 Marseille against the shelling 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.340
 because he does 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.720
 % of this increase is explained 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.230
 alone on stage 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.230
 the end of the match 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.820
 but this week 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.010
 group ares it was going to be easy the team 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.440
 the plaque 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.700
 4 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.690
 his father's theater of 0 10 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.220
 so that and it's cccm right now that wants while trying in 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.700
 as a player as a major player since you captain of this 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.320
 team 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.320
 early in the season that he really knew that tickets 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.530
 in europe climbing capabilities 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.800
 and where it was done as debates and meetings 5 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.960
 and 10% respectively 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.960
 the canaries so we do not know who 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.350
 one of them jean charbonnel 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.120
 road 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.120
 his boss's daughter well 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.220
 vincent bogard 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.370
 the map 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.710
 they find themselves for the field seedlings of laps 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.520
 he belongs 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.250
 so I'm part that was blue captain of this team in the 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.609
 massai say what to be happy that captain how did you feel 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:10.099
 this this trust mark of the coach 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.620
 to follow I invite all this time 

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:18.739
 all this without detour 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:19.709
 beaten on grass 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:20.859
 the 908 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:22.010
 way doing 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.869
 ap 

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:24.690
 the peace agreement 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.210
 listen to the sound was to help the important moments in in this 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.489
 season for you 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.639
 ddd turning this season and important victories 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:33.549
 despite the victory 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.639
 in front of Swiss sheng 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:38.639
 one of the kamikazes I'm proud of them 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.459
 because with a qi of the meeting 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:46.129
 has service saas 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:49.129
 outside it goes without saying 

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:52.189
 how to give back the match 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:55.189
 and then when we won against it's good to live 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:57.889
 the council of states 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:00.889
 so that the world knows that's how you find it so 

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:05.389
 frohmuhl in dh so personally how how do you find 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:07.109
 your season just recently 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.109
 a good chef 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:14.169
 I think I said it was last year 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.089
 pittsburgh the samatan cords that's for sure but it's true we knew 

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:21.049
 what we have is we only have eight 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.049
 go abroad sentimental at that time badly 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.229
 much less 

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:29.069
 this earth 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.459
 some 45% yes the bourbon group 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.489
 for 2011 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.090
 but that could cost 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.220
 their coach is first because this small city group would have 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.729
 still for contestation 

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:43.209
 this movement
