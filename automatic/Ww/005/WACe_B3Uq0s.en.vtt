00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
to some of the other larger figures in

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.830 
to some of the other larger figures in
the<00:05:33.400> line<00:05:33.550> you<00:05:33.940> can<00:05:34.120> see<00:05:34.240> that<00:05:34.419> he's<00:05:34.570> bigger

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
the line you can see that he's bigger

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.469 
the line you can see that he's bigger
than<00:05:34.930> characters<00:05:35.410> like<00:05:35.530> Dog<00:05:35.800> Pound<00:05:36.100> and<00:05:36.479> he's

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
than characters like Dog Pound and he's

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:39.030 
than characters like Dog Pound and he's
even<00:05:37.750> bigger<00:05:38.080> than<00:05:38.290> the<00:05:38.410> tallest<00:05:38.860> figure

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.040 
even bigger than the tallest figure

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.980 
even bigger than the tallest figure
we've<00:05:39.190> looked<00:05:39.370> at<00:05:39.460> so<00:05:39.610> far<00:05:39.820> Baxter<00:05:40.390> Stockman

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
we've looked at so far Baxter Stockman

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.719 
we've looked at so far Baxter Stockman
the<00:05:41.650> antenna<00:05:41.979> on<00:05:42.100> top<00:05:42.310> of<00:05:42.460> his<00:05:42.550> head

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 
the antenna on top of his head

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:44.700 
the antenna on top of his head
definitely<00:05:43.180> help<00:05:43.360> with<00:05:43.389> that<00:05:43.660> but<00:05:43.990> even<00:05:44.590> his

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
definitely help with that but even his

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.200 
definitely help with that but even his
head<00:05:44.950> is<00:05:45.070> a<00:05:45.100> little<00:05:45.220> bit<00:05:45.340> taller<00:05:45.610> making<00:05:46.060> this

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
head is a little bit taller making this

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.390 
head is a little bit taller making this
guy<00:05:46.419> officially<00:05:47.050> the<00:05:47.440> tallest<00:05:47.919> figure<00:05:48.220> in

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
guy officially the tallest figure in

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:56.340 
guy officially the tallest figure in
this<00:05:48.580> line<00:05:48.850> so<00:05:49.180> far<00:05:54.990> so<00:05:55.990> there<00:05:56.140> you<00:05:56.200> go<00:05:56.320> guys

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.350 
this line so far so there you go guys

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.230 
this line so far so there you go guys
there's<00:05:56.950> a<00:05:57.040> look<00:05:57.280> at<00:05:57.460> the<00:05:57.610> brand<00:05:58.000> new

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
there's a look at the brand new

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.500 
there's a look at the brand new
snakeweed<00:05:59.080> action<00:05:59.650> figure<00:06:00.010> this<00:06:00.610> is<00:06:00.669> probably

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:01.510 
snakeweed action figure this is probably

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.029 
snakeweed action figure this is probably
my<00:06:01.750> favorite<00:06:02.169> of<00:06:02.229> the<00:06:02.350> newer<00:06:02.500> figures<00:06:02.860> I've

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.039 
my favorite of the newer figures I've

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:04.860 
my favorite of the newer figures I've
taken<00:06:03.250> a<00:06:03.370> look<00:06:03.520> at<00:06:03.640> so<00:06:03.850> far<00:06:04.090> I<00:06:04.330> think<00:06:04.750> he

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
taken a look at so far I think he

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.140 
taken a look at so far I think he
translates<00:06:05.500> perfectly<00:06:05.620> into<00:06:06.430> action<00:06:06.880> figure

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
translates perfectly into action figure

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.060 
translates perfectly into action figure
form<00:06:07.450> he's<00:06:07.840> got<00:06:08.050> a<00:06:08.080> really<00:06:08.350> nice<00:06:08.560> little<00:06:08.800> paint

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.070 
form he's got a really nice little paint

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.590 
form he's got a really nice little paint
job<00:06:09.250> on<00:06:09.370> there<00:06:09.580> with<00:06:09.700> those<00:06:09.820> mixture<00:06:10.240> of<00:06:10.390> green

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:10.600 
job on there with those mixture of green

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.480 
job on there with those mixture of green
colors<00:06:10.990> I<00:06:11.200> love<00:06:11.680> all<00:06:11.919> the<00:06:12.070> vines<00:06:12.280> and

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:12.490 
colors I love all the vines and

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:13.890 
colors I love all the vines and
everything<00:06:12.550> sticking<00:06:13.120> off<00:06:13.240> of<00:06:13.270> them<00:06:13.539> and<00:06:13.690> his

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900 
everything sticking off of them and his

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.020 
everything sticking off of them and his
scale<00:06:14.260> is<00:06:14.560> really<00:06:14.950> nicely<00:06:15.370> done<00:06:15.760> on<00:06:15.940> this

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030 
scale is really nicely done on this

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.210 
scale is really nicely done on this
particular<00:06:16.210> figure<00:06:16.780> so<00:06:17.620> if<00:06:17.740> this<00:06:17.830> is<00:06:17.979> when<00:06:18.130> you

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:18.220 
particular figure so if this is when you

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.770 
particular figure so if this is when you
see<00:06:18.370> in<00:06:18.460> the<00:06:18.580> stores<00:06:18.880> I<00:06:19.150> would<00:06:19.360> definitely

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:19.780
