00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.690
 the church board 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.010

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.830
 to film 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.870

 has and peak energy research 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.060

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.060
 and that can go here in the title is absolutely right 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.810
 on the other hand was a big one 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.000

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.270
 we do not go for darfur life 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.250
 until there is enough 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.230
 I know, among other things 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.100

 its spain i now have a 40,000 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.140

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.380
 have listened and 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.360

 the sensor is even if they are chosen 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.259

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:32.569
 just sips and
