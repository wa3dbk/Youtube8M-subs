III from the 80s

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.400 
III from the 80s
I<00:05:51.800> think<00:05:52.280> 83<00:05:52.789> like<00:05:53.419> I<00:05:53.539> said<00:05:53.750> I<00:05:53.780> don't<00:05:53.930> know<00:05:54.199> for

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.410 
I think 83 like I said I don't know for

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.860 
I think 83 like I said I don't know for
sure<00:05:54.460> it's<00:05:55.460> good<00:05:55.639> with<00:05:55.729> the<00:05:55.820> cleans<00:05:56.120> it's<00:05:56.720> got

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
sure it's good with the cleans it's got

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.200 
sure it's good with the cleans it's got
a<00:05:56.900> nice<00:05:57.020> shimmer<00:05:57.320> to<00:05:57.590> it<00:05:57.729> what<00:05:58.729> I<00:05:58.759> really<00:05:59.030> like

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210 
a nice shimmer to it what I really like

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:00.700 
a nice shimmer to it what I really like
is<00:05:59.360> when<00:05:59.479> you<00:05:59.539> turn<00:05:59.900> the<00:06:00.020> gain<00:06:00.229> on<00:06:00.380> it<00:06:00.500> really

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
is when you turn the gain on it really

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.800 
is when you turn the gain on it really
lets<00:06:01.190> it<00:06:01.280> come<00:06:01.520> alive<00:06:01.639> and<00:06:02.030> add<00:06:02.330> a<00:06:02.600> nice

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
lets it come alive and add a nice

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.860 
lets it come alive and add a nice
metallic<00:06:03.550> sounding<00:06:04.550> shinier<00:06:05.060> plan<00:06:05.330> like<00:06:05.720> from

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.870 
metallic sounding shinier plan like from

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.800 
metallic sounding shinier plan like from
the<00:06:05.960> 80s<00:06:06.410> or<00:06:06.500> 90s<00:06:06.560> type<00:06:07.370> of<00:06:07.550> tone<00:06:07.789> so<00:06:08.600> what<00:06:08.690> it's

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
the 80s or 90s type of tone so what it's

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:15.310 
the 80s or 90s type of tone so what it's
good<00:06:08.990> for<00:06:09.220> the<00:06:10.220> only<00:06:10.639> drawback<00:06:11.090> is<00:06:11.300> it's<00:06:14.320> not

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.320 
good for the only drawback is it's not

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.820 
good for the only drawback is it's not
true<00:06:15.470> bypass<00:06:15.770> and<00:06:16.190> it<00:06:17.289> really<00:06:18.289> does<00:06:18.500> color

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:18.830 
true bypass and it really does color

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:19.480 
true bypass and it really does color
your<00:06:19.039> tone

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:19.490 
your tone

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.640 
your tone
it<00:06:19.910> takes<00:06:20.270> away<00:06:20.539> it's<00:06:20.720> like<00:06:20.780> a<00:06:20.870> tone<00:06:21.139> sucker<00:06:21.560> it

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650 
it takes away it's like a tone sucker it

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.560 
it takes away it's like a tone sucker it
doesn't<00:06:21.889> color<00:06:22.070> it<00:06:22.430> sucks<00:06:23.030> it<00:06:23.120> away<00:06:23.300> when<00:06:23.479> you

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:23.570 
doesn't color it sucks it away when you

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.360 
doesn't color it sucks it away when you
when<00:06:23.900> it's<00:06:24.020> off<00:06:24.199> you're<00:06:24.680> losing<00:06:25.070> a<00:06:25.130> lot<00:06:25.250> of

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370 
when it's off you're losing a lot of

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.850 
when it's off you're losing a lot of
time<00:06:25.520> so<00:06:26.479> my<00:06:26.930> only<00:06:27.110> recommendation<00:06:27.320> with<00:06:27.770> this

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
time so my only recommendation with this

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.980 
time so my only recommendation with this
pedal<00:06:28.100> is<00:06:28.370> you<00:06:28.729> have<00:06:28.940> a<00:06:28.970> looper<00:06:29.300> box<00:06:29.510> or

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:29.990 
pedal is you have a looper box or

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.960 
pedal is you have a looper box or
something<00:06:30.500> along<00:06:30.710> those<00:06:30.889> lines<00:06:31.010> a<00:06:31.310> bypass<00:06:31.669> box

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:31.970 
something along those lines a bypass box

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.159 
something along those lines a bypass box
something<00:06:32.479> that<00:06:32.570> you<00:06:32.630> can<00:06:32.780> put<00:06:32.900> in<00:06:32.990> the<00:06:33.050> loop

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:33.169 
something that you can put in the loop

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:35.500 
something that you can put in the loop
and<00:06:33.580> then<00:06:34.580> it's<00:06:34.760> a<00:06:34.820> great<00:06:35.060> pedal<00:06:35.330> if<00:06:35.389> you're

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:35.510 
and then it's a great pedal if you're

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:38.140 
and then it's a great pedal if you're
looking<00:06:35.750> for<00:06:35.900> a<00:06:35.930> course<00:06:36.699> but<00:06:37.699> other<00:06:37.880> than<00:06:37.970> that

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:38.150 
looking for a course but other than that

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.320 
looking for a course but other than that
