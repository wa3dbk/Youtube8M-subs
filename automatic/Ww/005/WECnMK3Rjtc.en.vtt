00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.970 

so<00:01:02.030> you<00:01:02.090> summon<00:01:02.600> one<00:01:02.750> button<00:01:03.050> the<00:01:03.500> screen<00:01:03.770> goes

so you summon one button the screen goes

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.690 
so you summon one button the screen goes
black<00:01:04.309> and<00:01:04.519> you<00:01:05.239> destroy<00:01:06.230> or<00:01:07.100> if<00:01:07.400> you<00:01:07.520> don't

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
black and you destroy or if you don't

kill them in one hit it stuns them for
three<00:01:10.100> seconds<00:01:10.610> I<00:01:10.760> believe<00:01:11.060> that<00:01:11.690> only<00:01:11.930> works

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
three seconds I believe that only works

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.340 
three seconds I believe that only works
on<00:01:13.120> normal<00:01:14.120> monsters<00:01:14.540> it<00:01:14.750> doesn't<00:01:15.020> work<00:01:15.140> in

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
on normal monsters it doesn't work in

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.830 
on normal monsters it doesn't work in
stronghold<00:01:16.040> but<00:01:16.729> it<00:01:16.820> does<00:01:17.000> work<00:01:17.180> at<00:01:17.479> the

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
stronghold but it does work at the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.390 
stronghold but it does work at the
mechanical<00:01:18.410> graveyards<00:01:18.950> that's<00:01:19.160> pretty

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
mechanical graveyards that's pretty

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.050 
mechanical graveyards that's pretty
interesting

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
interesting

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.820 
interesting
I<00:01:20.090> don't<00:01:20.479> think<00:01:20.510> it's<00:01:20.720> too<00:01:20.840> useful<00:01:21.050> honestly

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
I don't think it's too useful honestly

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.180 
I don't think it's too useful honestly
but<00:01:23.080> that's<00:01:24.080> one<00:01:24.320> button<00:01:24.619> for<00:01:24.650> you<00:01:26.950> I'll<00:01:27.950> be

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
a nice blue effect on top of my head

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.030 
a nice blue effect on top of my head
let's<00:01:48.530> look<00:01:48.680> at<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:48.830> scale<00:01:49.840> so<00:01:50.840> it<00:01:50.990> costs<00:01:51.320> 200

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
let's look at the scale so it costs 200

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.020 
let's look at the scale so it costs 200
soul<00:01:52.880> points<00:01:54.100> does<00:01:55.100> two<00:01:55.340> thousand<00:01:55.820> percent

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
soul points does two thousand percent

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.050 
soul points does two thousand percent
damage<00:01:56.390> and<00:01:56.660> it<00:01:57.560> hits<00:01:57.740> 15<00:01:58.340> enemies<00:01:58.729> so<00:01:58.910> it's

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
damage and it hits 15 enemies so it's

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.649 
damage and it hits 15 enemies so it's
similar<00:01:59.300> to<00:02:00.880> one<00:02:01.880> Bonz<00:02:02.119> one<00:02:03.039> except<00:02:04.039> it's<00:02:04.280> a

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
similar to one Bonz one except it's a

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.690 
similar to one Bonz one except it's a
mobbing<00:02:05.659> skill<00:02:06.020> and<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:06.440> cooldown<00:02:07.040> is<00:02:07.400> much

much<00:02:08.450> longer<00:02:08.920> 120<00:02:09.920> second<00:02:10.220> cooldown<00:02:11.110> let's

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
much longer 120 second cooldown let's

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.400 
much longer 120 second cooldown let's

seconds<00:02:24.170> which<00:02:24.920> is<00:02:25.100> pretty<00:02:25.400> interesting

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
seconds which is pretty interesting

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.540

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
for a hundred seconds unfortunately it

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.260
