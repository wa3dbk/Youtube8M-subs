distance<00:00:30.150> from<00:00:30.360> the<00:00:30.570> camera<00:00:30.750> so<00:00:31.500> we<00:00:31.529> actually

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
distance from the camera so we actually

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.320

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.199 
in fact the presence of these domes over
the<00:02:21.320> maurya<00:02:21.680> would<00:02:22.310> give<00:02:22.490> a<00:02:22.520> synthetic

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
the maurya would give a synthetic

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.150 
the maurya would give a synthetic
illusion<00:02:23.660> and<00:02:23.810> would<00:02:24.290> have<00:02:24.410> Brody<00:02:24.620> outside<00:02:25.070> of

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
illusion and would have Brody outside of

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.470 
illusion and would have Brody outside of
the<00:02:25.250> spacecraft<00:02:25.490> and<00:02:25.910> I<00:02:25.970> haven't<00:02:26.270> done

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
the spacecraft and I haven't done

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.690 
the spacecraft and I haven't done
detailed<00:02:26.959> numbers<00:02:27.380> but<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.040> model<00:02:28.340> seems<00:02:28.580> to

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
detailed numbers but the model seems to

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.970 
detailed numbers but the model seems to
be<00:02:28.850> intriguing<00:02:29.780> and<00:02:30.050> it<00:02:30.170> it's<00:02:30.530> worthy<00:02:30.860> of

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
be intriguing and it it's worthy of

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.920 
be intriguing and it it's worthy of
being<00:02:31.160> follow<00:02:31.430> up<00:02:31.610> so<00:02:32.150> much<00:02:32.300> of<00:02:32.480> this<00:02:32.600> has<00:02:32.810> to

schmitt<00:04:07.159> with<00:04:08.159> all<00:04:08.280> of<00:04:08.489> the<00:04:08.580> op<00:04:08.700> so<00:04:09.030> those<00:04:09.269> that

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
schmitt with all of the op so those that

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.160 
schmitt with all of the op so those that
know<00:04:09.750> well<00:04:10.080> they're<00:04:10.200> on<00:04:10.319> the<00:04:10.409> order<00:04:10.650> of<00:04:10.680> meters

glass that are obviously scattering
light<00:04:18.359> with<00:04:18.540> reflection<00:04:19.049> coming<00:04:19.229> back<00:04:19.530> like

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
light with reflection coming back like

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.560 
light with reflection coming back like
like<00:04:20.250> when<00:04:20.400> you<00:04:20.519> when<00:04:20.699> you<00:04:20.729> look<00:04:21.000> at<00:04:21.150> windows

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
like when you when you look at windows

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.360 
like when you when you look at windows
your<00:04:21.780> landing<00:04:22.199> at<00:04:22.290> cities<00:04:22.590> at<00:04:22.800> sunset<00:04:23.190> or

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
your landing at cities at sunset or

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.580 
your landing at cities at sunset or
sunrise<00:04:23.690> you'll<00:04:24.690> see<00:04:24.930> the<00:04:25.080> windows<00:04:25.380> all

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
sunrise you'll see the windows all

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.860 
sunrise you'll see the windows all
shining<00:04:26.060> because<00:04:27.060> they're<00:04:27.180> reflecting<00:04:27.780> the

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
shining because they're reflecting the

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.500 
shining because they're reflecting the
Sun<00:04:28.110> back<00:04:28.320> at<00:04:28.530> you<00:04:28.740> imagine<00:04:29.669> you<00:04:29.760> had<00:04:29.940> blast<00:04:30.240> in

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
Sun back at you imagine you had blast in

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.420 
Sun back at you imagine you had blast in
front<00:04:30.810> of<00:04:30.990> that<00:04:31.110> reflection<00:04:31.530> it<00:04:31.889> would<00:04:32.250> then

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
front of that reflection it would then

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.540 
front of that reflection it would then
cause<00:04:32.729> a<00:04:32.760> prismatic<00:04:33.680> refraction<00:04:34.680> see

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
cause a prismatic refraction see

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.969 
cause a prismatic refraction see
basically<00:04:36.030> I<00:04:36.150> mean<00:04:36.449> I<00:04:36.539> wanted<00:04:37.080> when<00:04:37.530> I<00:04:37.590> friends

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
basically I mean I wanted when I friends

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:39.110 
basically I mean I wanted when I friends
to<00:04:38.130> bring<00:04:38.250> a<00:04:38.400> prism<00:04:38.729> here<00:04:38.880> so<00:04:39.000> I<00:04:39.060> could

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
to bring a prism here so I could

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.150 
to bring a prism here so I could
actually<00:04:39.360> show<00:04:39.780> you<00:04:39.810> with<00:04:40.530> our<00:04:40.650> spotlight

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
actually show you with our spotlight

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.370 
actually show you with our spotlight
what<00:04:41.699> prisons<00:04:42.330> do<00:04:42.630> and<00:04:42.900> what<00:04:43.020> they<00:04:43.169> look<00:04:43.350> like

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
what prisons do and what they look like

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.830 
what prisons do and what they look like
but<00:04:44.070> you<00:04:44.160> can<00:04:44.310> experiment<00:04:44.669> at<00:04:45.090> home<00:04:45.120> do<00:04:45.690> this

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
but you can experiment at home do this

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.080 
but you can experiment at home do this
at<00:04:45.990> home<00:04:46.020> I've<00:04:46.410> asked<00:04:47.370> you<00:04:47.430> I<00:04:47.490> beg<00:04:47.699> you<00:04:47.880> and

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
at home I've asked you I beg you and

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.850

Smoking<00:04:54.510> Gun<00:04:54.930> if<00:04:55.710> I<00:04:55.919> had<00:04:56.160> to<00:04:56.280> rest<00:04:56.520> our<00:04:56.699> case<00:04:56.760> on

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
Smoking Gun if I had to rest our case on

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.469 
Smoking Gun if I had to rest our case on
one<00:04:57.690> single<00:04:58.229> piece<00:04:58.680> of<00:04:58.740> data<00:04:59.220> which<00:05:00.120> turns<00:05:00.360> out

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
one single piece of data which turns out

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.300 
one single piece of data which turns out
to<00:05:00.539> be<00:05:00.660> replicated<00:05:01.590> again<00:05:01.830> and<00:05:01.979> again<00:05:02.160> and

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
to be replicated again and again and

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.189 
to be replicated again and again and
again<00:05:02.520> it's<00:05:03.180> the<00:05:03.270> discovery<00:05:03.510> of<00:05:03.900> the

again it's the discovery of the

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:06.890 
again it's the discovery of the
prismatic<00:05:04.680> rainbows<00:05:05.340> from<00:05:05.699> the<00:05:05.820> glass<00:05:06.030> in<00:05:06.389> the
