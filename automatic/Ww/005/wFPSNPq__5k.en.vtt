it's interesting we do things in a very
similar<00:00:14.210> way<00:00:14.360> but<00:00:15.050> mine's<00:00:15.559> more<00:00:15.830> of<00:00:15.950> a

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
similar way but mine's more of a

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.630 
similar way but mine's more of a
permanent<00:00:16.279> fix<00:00:17.650> which<00:00:18.650> may<00:00:18.920> be<00:00:18.949> a<00:00:19.100> good<00:00:19.400> and<00:00:19.580> a

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
permanent fix which may be a good and a

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.019 
permanent fix which may be a good and a
bad<00:00:19.670> thing<00:00:20.060> at<00:00:20.150> the<00:00:20.240> same<00:00:20.390> time<00:00:21.400> now<00:00:22.400> I<00:00:22.430> must

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
bad thing at the same time now I must

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:24.700 
bad thing at the same time now I must
say<00:00:23.210> I<00:00:23.240> hate<00:00:23.570> videos<00:00:23.960> with<00:00:24.170> a<00:00:24.230> camera<00:00:24.470> in<00:00:24.650> one

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
stick my phone as long as I've got the

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.819 
stick my phone as long as I've got the
rucksack<00:01:46.310> on<00:01:46.399> me<00:01:46.520> which<00:01:46.640> has<00:01:46.759> got<00:01:46.939> the<00:01:47.829> the

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
rucksack on me which has got the the

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.029 
rucksack on me which has got the the
case<00:01:49.520> that<00:01:50.210> I<00:01:50.240> mount<00:01:50.539> the<00:01:50.630> camera<00:01:50.840> in<00:01:51.140> I'm

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
case that I mount the camera in I'm

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.980 
case that I mount the camera in I'm
always<00:01:52.310> got<00:01:52.670> my<00:01:52.759> microphone<00:01:53.179> I<00:01:53.390> just<00:01:53.569> probably

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
always got my microphone I just probably

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.649 
always got my microphone I just probably
don't<00:01:54.439> plug<00:01:54.710> it<00:01:54.829> in<00:01:54.890> and<00:01:55.759> offer<00:01:55.939> go<00:01:56.119> and<00:01:56.359> then<00:01:56.600> I

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
don't plug it in and offer go and then I

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.389 
don't plug it in and offer go and then I
can<00:01:56.810> just<00:01:56.840> pop<00:01:57.079> it<00:01:57.200> all<00:01:57.259> back<00:01:57.409> inside<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:58.249> only

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
can just pop it all back inside the only

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:59.709 
can just pop it all back inside the only
downside<00:01:58.759> is<00:01:58.789> if<00:01:58.999> I've<00:01:59.119> got<00:01:59.240> the<00:01:59.359> camera

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
downside is if I've got the camera

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:01.690 
downside is if I've got the camera
mounted<00:02:00.289> onto<00:02:00.439> my<00:02:00.679> chest<00:02:00.710> and<00:02:01.249> I<00:02:01.399> want<00:02:01.549> to<00:02:01.609> take

shoulder part that bad
to<00:02:13.970> keep<00:02:14.120> it<00:02:14.270> away<00:02:14.330> from<00:02:14.860> flapping<00:02:15.860> around<00:02:16.070> I

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
to keep it away from flapping around I

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.020 
to keep it away from flapping around I
kept<00:02:18.830> doing<00:02:19.010> that<00:02:19.130> for<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.430> first<00:02:19.670> few<00:02:19.850> days
