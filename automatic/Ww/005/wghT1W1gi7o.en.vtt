00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:07.379
 hello girls that welcome to the channel 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.599
 well, this video is a video 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.769
 answer to all the requests that I have 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.900
 had on social networks during 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.030
 these last months of that because not 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.490
 would be with my routine capillary videos 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.740
 on youtube you already know that the routine 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.600
 capillary I post it every month on the blog 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.510
 well you know that for me the hair 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.170
 It is very important I take care of it very much 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.910
 I give it a lot of importance and almost every 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.820
 three months I usually do some treatment 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.540
 of hair restructuring 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:39.059
 rehydration nutrition or with either 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.379
 Argan oil jelly or once I made 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.820
 the treatment was moore to a 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.930
 Japanese treatment that I also like 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.100
 very much and more than anything I'm very few 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.989
 sometimes to hairdresser so the 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.030
 treatment and its emulating I did it in a 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.030
 hairdresser at the hairdresser's backstage 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.219
 barcelona but most times I 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.350
 I do the treatments at home for me 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.030
 It has always been 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.859
 it's very satisfying it's true I have not 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.239
 had the need to go to a 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.339
 hairdresser then to make me a 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.740
 very exhaustive treatment more than anything 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.869
 is that I do not believe that my hair 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.470
 I do not hurt him too much, 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.080
 ironed daily but yes I use many 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.280
 thermal protectors for hair 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.990
 the days that I will not do to the street 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.610
 Well, he did not iron it, he did not tie it 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.350
 with gums because you already know that it breaks the 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.570
 hair this month I wanted to stop 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.039
 do or services let's say what does 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.720
 few days he has already spent the month of 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:30.240
 July because this treatment has 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.240
 very much liked is the treatment that 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.590
 give the rest, you are going to say good to me 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.780
 the time how do you do the treatment of 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.130
 keratin if you're in good summer 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.840
 Well I'm going to tell you girls that in 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.250
 barcelona of summer there is a friend who 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.960
 has agreed on a facebook status that 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.030
 it said summer does not exist are the parents 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.619
 because in Barcelona in the summer it's like 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.390
 that there has been no truth and it is not our 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.729
 case if you are on vacation and still 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.560
 are you from swimming pools or are you going to places 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.750
 paradisiacal and your hair is still going to 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.760
 suffer damage I advise you not to use 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.350
 this product until you stop acne 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.210
 to your hair because this is a 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.630
 product that what we will do is 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.340
 return to our initial state of 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.010
 hair to restructure all the fiber 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.290
 capillary to hydrate her a lot to 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:12.850
 set it up now for the 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.920
 entrance of that time the one of the 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.770
 things that I liked the most is that there 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.840
 different types of treatment 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.760
 we have the intensive treatment we have 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.910
 the compact treatment and we have the 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.470
 quick treatment and I advise you in 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.720
 two first weeks we made a 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.760
 intensive treatment so I did the 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.530
 third week I did compact treatment 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.230
 and now I'm doing it once 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.940
 week the quick treatment then in 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.380
 what is the treatment and I tell you 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.940
 for me the most important thing is that 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.610
 let's start with the intensive treatment 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.170
 you will already see how it goes 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.690
 our hair if our whale is 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.550
 super damaged to the best with a dose of 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.740
 intensive you will have enough I got myself 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.170
 two you can do three four there's no 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.670
 limit is what differentiates the 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.770
 Intensive treatment treatment 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.390
 compact the fast treatment the only thing 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.890
 what sets it apart is 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.720
 the duration of application of the product 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.970
 we started with the intensive treatment 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.220
 this lasts for 15 minutes is 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.959
 the longest lasting treatment of 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.060
 all that's why it's called treatment 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.340
 intensive is the application of 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.170
 shampoo we can wash it once or twice 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.270
 as we are used to as we wash 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.250
 usually after we go to the plate 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.050
 strong that is the mask we have it 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.550
 to apply for all the hair of a 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.470
 easier way you can make follow a 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.360
 comb that has the barbs quite 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.650
 separate several we're also going to join 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.190
 sometimes I for having although it 's wrong 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.390
 done because we drag but in 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.400
 treatment issues and such to me 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.459
 it goes pretty well then you can 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.950
 apply without problems in the root because 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.540
 I have fat roots and dry ends 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.920
 and the truth is that I do not have to 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.739
 hair is oiled more than it is 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.900
 normal and we have to let it act 10 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.000
 minutes are worth when our 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.739
 ten minutes we rinse well we remove 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.200
 well all the product is worth not 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.820
 no product then dry we have 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.880
 the hair with a towel to duplicate 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.350
 the excess water and we apply the serum 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.330
 worth the cell we have to apply 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.980
 I thoroughly and I apply lock 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.989
 I'm going to retreat 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.799
 I'm applying a lock to another 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.330
 lock 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:09.950
 so until I have all the hair I know 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.900
 that I have it well covered with the serum 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.489
 when I have my hair well covered 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.440
 with the serum we block a mirror to the 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.419
 hair dry until it is not 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.489
 nothing wet and then I apply the iron 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:22.250
 this does not tell us in it 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.500
 the ritual or in the treatment that we 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.880
 explains in dollar but for my 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.350
 experiences, I tell you that it is the best 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.360
 you can do because with the iron what 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.010
 What you do is seal the cuticle and 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.410
 you are sure that keratin is not going 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.699
 it's not going to come out of that hair fiber is what 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.050
 best we can do 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:38.960
 this is the intensive treatment and in 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.479
 theory is the treatment that gives us 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.190
 more hydration more shine to me is the 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.990
 that I liked the most and I already tell you but 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.970
 that he has not needed more than two weeks 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.070
 we pass to the compact treatment the 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.330
 Compact treatment lasts 10 minutes and 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.979
 what the difference of the treatment 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.900
 intensive is that we do not serve the 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:56.180
 serum the insurance we will only leave 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.889
 for the times where we have the change 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.500
 very spoiled because we have passed 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:02.000
 with the plate with putty we are 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.220
 the hole has gone we have had 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.830
 blondes or have fallen sharply the tone 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.780
 our hair is finished the hair 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.090
 fatal for any disaster that we have 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.550
 had with our hair the best is 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.200
 intensive treatment you use it 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.420
 you can have stored in your dressing table 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.210
 and every time you need us you can 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:22.910
 to serve I have used twice and I 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:26.840
 it is more or less there is enough left 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:28.310
 70% of the product that more then that 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.370
 the difference also that the mask 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:33.020
 only we have to do is 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.570
 for 10 minutes only 10 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.400
 little rinse and already directly 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.860
 we can do what we want if we 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.450
 we want to apply another serum of tips 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.950
 we can apply a tip serum a 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.750
 combing cream whatever we want or 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.370
 simply nothing and we comb our hair as we 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.950
 let's have habitually and finally 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.390
 we went to the quick application for the 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.370
 quick treatment that is the treatment 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.290
 what I am doing now 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.940
 ok I'm not doing anymore I know this 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:57.770
 shampoo because it's completely empty 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.720
 I'm going to take it out on finished products 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.940
 shortly but so I'm still using 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.620
 the mask is worth I keep using a 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.780
 five minutes per week 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.090
 we just need that then to go 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.070
 adding a little bit of treatment to 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.540
 keep the treatment we did the 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.130
 previous weeks 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.080
 more girls and that 's all I know that also 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.790
 you are asking a lot what is the 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.710
 color of my hair dye and I know that to 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:22.070
 Sometimes it depends on the video and it feels 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.900
 quite a lot of color today 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.670
 what is it is a pretty dark chestnut 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:28.010
 chocolate is that in some videos mb 

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:30.980
 like red but not this is the tone that 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:33.230
