i'll never make an 81 on this is how you

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.349 
i'll never make an 81 on this is how you
first<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.350> get<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.769> square<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.609> any<00:00:24.060> type<00:00:24.330> of

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
first you get a square of any type of

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.509 
first you get a square of any type of
paper<00:00:24.630> this<00:00:25.470> one's<00:00:25.680> pretty<00:00:25.920> folded<00:00:26.340> that's

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
paper this one's pretty folded that's

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.630 
paper this one's pretty folded that's
why<00:00:26.730> it<00:00:26.789> looks<00:00:26.970> like<00:00:27.180> this<00:00:27.980> you<00:00:28.980> folded<00:00:29.400> by

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
why it looks like this you folded by

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.190 
why it looks like this you folded by
making<00:00:30.060> home<00:00:31.369> you<00:00:32.369> know<00:00:32.570> first<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.719> make<00:00:33.960> on

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
making home you know first you make on

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.700 
making home you know first you make on
the<00:00:34.739> trials<00:00:35.340> on<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.899> make<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.050> trial<00:00:37.350> short

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
the trials on you make a trial short

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.540 
the trials on you make a trial short
form<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.210> do<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.739> two<00:00:40.739> times<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:41.399> make

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
form and you do that two times to make

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.180 
form and you do that two times to make
an<00:00:41.730> X<00:00:42.030> like<00:00:42.360> shape<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.860> should<00:00:44.070> be<00:00:44.100> able

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
an X like shape and you should be able

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.580 
an X like shape and you should be able
to<00:00:44.340> know<00:00:44.430> how<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.610> do<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.570> enjoyed<00:00:46.350> and

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
to know how to do that and enjoyed and

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:55.970 
to know how to do that and enjoyed and
then<00:00:47.219> on<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:48.480> fold<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:54.530> where<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.710> for<00:00:55.890> you

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
then on you fold it where is it for you

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.340 
then on you fold it where is it for you
I'll<00:00:56.160> get<00:00:56.399> smelly<00:00:57.239> farts<00:00:57.660> straight<00:00:57.930> like<00:00:58.109> this

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
I'll get smelly farts straight like this

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.099 
I'll get smelly farts straight like this
to<00:00:58.920> make<00:00:59.039> like<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.579> know<00:00:59.730> like<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:00.359> half-acre

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
shape long ways and it should look

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.580 
shape long ways and it should look
something<00:01:04.739> like<00:01:05.100> this<00:01:05.659> you<00:01:06.659> take<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.380> two

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
something like this you take the two

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.410 
something like this you take the two
sides<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.310> throat<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.700> elegant<00:01:09.090> airplane

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
sides and throat and elegant airplane

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.539 
sides and throat and elegant airplane
mode<00:01:09.689> already<00:01:10.409> having<00:01:10.799> foreign<00:01:11.010> aid<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.430> it's

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
mode already having foreign aid and it's

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.060 
mode already having foreign aid and it's
not<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:11.909> good<00:01:12.090> because<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.390> was<00:01:12.540> rushing<00:01:13.070> for

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
not that good because I was rushing for

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.420 
not that good because I was rushing for
the<00:01:14.159> N<00:01:14.369> word<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:15.020> should<00:01:16.020> look<00:01:16.170> like<00:01:16.200> this<00:01:16.560> the

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
the N word I should look like this the

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.780 
the N word I should look like this the
back<00:01:17.640> here<00:01:18.590> can<00:01:19.590> form<00:01:19.830> down<00:01:20.009> like<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.400> and

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
back here can form down like that and

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.950 
back here can form down like that and
you<00:01:21.750> fold<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.110> inward<00:01:22.259> like<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.130> arm

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
you fold it inward like that to the arm

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.370 
you fold it inward like that to the arm
like<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.200> bilious<00:01:25.860> i<00:01:26.070> did<00:01:26.280> on<00:01:26.840> tail<00:01:27.840> light

you got to connect them you take the

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.819 
you got to connect them you take the
front<00:01:41.400> which<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.210> not<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.420> tail<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.930> connect<00:01:43.740> it

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
front which is not a tail and connect it

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.039 
front which is not a tail and connect it
to<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.040> back<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.430> this<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.790> how<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:44.939> do<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.270> is

to the back of this and how you do it is
you<00:01:46.079> take<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.829> front<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.549> shove<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:47.970> in<00:01:48.060> there

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
you take the front you shove it in there

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.240 
you take the front you shove it in there
um<00:01:49.220> wait<00:01:50.220> they're<00:01:50.759> not<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.000> front<00:01:51.710> yeah<00:01:52.710> you

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
um wait they're not the front yeah you

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.609 
um wait they're not the front yeah you
take<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.549> front<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.570> we<00:01:54.720> put<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.049> in<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.439> back

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
take the front and we put it in the back

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.780 
take the front and we put it in the back
of<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:56.509> serve<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.770> at<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.950> top<00:01:59.189> don't<00:01:59.670> be

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
of that serve it at the top don't be

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.249 
of that serve it at the top don't be
like<00:02:00.000> two<00:02:00.240> little<00:02:00.479> things<00:02:00.689> sticking<00:02:01.079> out

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
like two little things sticking out

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.990 
like two little things sticking out
you're<00:02:01.860> supposed<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.280> put<00:02:02.460> them<00:02:02.640> into<00:02:02.790> the

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
you're supposed to put them into the

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.359 
you're supposed to put them into the
other<00:02:03.149> side<00:02:03.540> by<00:02:04.200> filling<00:02:04.590> them<00:02:04.680> down<00:02:04.890> in<00:02:05.130> looks

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
other side by filling them down in looks

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.309 
other side by filling them down in looks
like<00:02:05.700> this<00:02:06.829> whoops

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.289 

and<00:02:12.319> then<00:02:12.500> pull<00:02:12.709> in<00:02:12.860> and<00:02:13.610> it<00:02:13.790> should<00:02:13.970> be<00:02:14.000> like

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
and then pull in and it should be like

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:22.199 
and then pull in and it should be like
