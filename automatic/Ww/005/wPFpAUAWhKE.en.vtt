00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
the Dell XPS M 1330

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.530

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
and it was released a couple of months

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.940 
and it was released a couple of months
ago<00:00:36.720> no<00:00:36.990> apparently<00:00:37.350> they've<00:00:37.530> had<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.740> few

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:39.810 
problems with getting this out one day I

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.300 
problems with getting this out one day I
think<00:00:40.080> it<00:00:40.230> was<00:00:40.320> slightly<00:00:40.710> delayed<00:00:40.980> he's<00:00:41.220> I

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.310 
think it was slightly delayed he's I

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.710 
think it was slightly delayed he's I
don't<00:00:41.340> know<00:00:41.550> people<00:00:41.820> who<00:00:41.910> ordered<00:00:42.329> them<00:00:42.480> and

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
don't know people who ordered them and

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.790 
don't know people who ordered them and
I'll<00:00:42.840> happy<00:00:43.170> with<00:00:43.290> them<00:00:43.410> now<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.650> they've

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
I'll happy with them now that they've

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.140 
I'll happy with them now that they've
arrived<00:00:44.100> but<00:00:44.340> they<00:00:44.460> did<00:00:44.610> arrived<00:00:44.850> rather<00:00:44.970> late

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.150 
arrived but they did arrived rather late

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.000 
arrived but they did arrived rather late
yes<00:00:46.100> so<00:00:47.100> it's<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.340> 13.3<00:00:48.120> inch<00:00:48.540> screen<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.470> Dell

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
yes so it's a 13.3 inch screen and Dell

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.290 
yes so it's a 13.3 inch screen and Dell
were<00:00:50.100> actually<00:00:50.460> claiming<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:50.970> it's<00:00:51.120> the

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
were actually claiming that it's the

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.220 
were actually claiming that it's the
thinnest<00:00:51.829> 13.3<00:00:52.829> inch<00:00:53.040> laptop<00:00:53.790> around<00:00:53.970> and<00:00:54.540> at

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
thinnest 13.3 inch laptop around and at

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.440 
thinnest 13.3 inch laptop around and at
the<00:00:55.440> thinnest<00:00:55.710> point<00:00:55.920> it's<00:00:56.190> 25<00:00:56.790> millimeters

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.450 
the thinnest point it's 25 millimeters

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.540 
the thinnest point it's 25 millimeters
and<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.380> thickest<00:00:58.800> which<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.160> imagine<00:00:59.489> would

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
and the thickest which I imagine would

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.360 
and the thickest which I imagine would
be<00:00:59.700> the<00:00:59.850> spine<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.420> 36<00:01:01.380> millimeters<00:01:02.130> and<00:01:02.280> the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
be the spine is 36 millimeters and the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.590 
be the spine is 36 millimeters and the
funny<00:01:02.550> thing<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.820> we<00:01:02.970> asked<00:01:03.120> them<00:01:03.329> about<00:01:03.390> this

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
funny thing is we asked them about this

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.639 
funny thing is we asked them about this
at<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.809> launch<00:01:03.989> we<00:01:04.170> asked<00:01:04.290> them<00:01:04.439> if<00:01:04.530> they

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:04.649 
at the launch we asked them if they

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:06.109 
at the launch we asked them if they
could<00:01:04.680> justify<00:01:05.159> saying<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.759> was<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.880> finish

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
could justify saying it was a finish

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.490 
could justify saying it was a finish
that's<00:01:06.299> not<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.630> first<00:01:06.689> point<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.200> they<00:01:07.320> said

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
that's not the first point and they said

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.940 
that's not the first point and they said
legally<00:01:07.920> they<00:01:08.100> could<00:01:12.109> okay<00:01:13.109> so<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.530> weighs<00:01:13.679> 4

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
legally they could okay so it weighs 4

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.059 
legally they could okay so it weighs 4
pounds

00:01:16.059 --> 00:01:16.069 

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:19.219 

really<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.189> think<00:01:17.399> that's<00:01:17.549> 1.4<00:01:18.060> kilos<00:01:18.689> if<00:01:18.960> my

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
really I think that's 1.4 kilos if my

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.090 
really I think that's 1.4 kilos if my
calculations<00:01:19.920> serve<00:01:20.880> me<00:01:21.119> correct<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:22.100> now

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
calculations serve me correct and now

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.219 
calculations serve me correct and now
it's<00:01:23.340> got<00:01:23.520> those<00:01:24.060> two<00:01:24.299> options<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.899> can<00:01:25.079> get

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
it's got those two options you can get

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.709 
it's got those two options you can get
the<00:01:25.350> 9<00:01:25.560> sound<00:01:26.039> battery<00:01:26.609> which<00:01:27.090> means<00:01:27.359> that<00:01:27.600> it

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:27.719 
the 9 sound battery which means that it

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:29.690 
the 9 sound battery which means that it
sticks<00:01:28.020> out<00:01:28.200> quite<00:01:28.649> a<00:01:28.679> bit<00:01:28.799> further<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.399> makes

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
sticks out quite a bit further and makes

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.999 
sticks out quite a bit further and makes
it<00:01:29.880> really<00:01:30.060> chunky<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:31.109> is<00:01:31.289> the<00:01:31.409> 6<00:01:31.709> cell

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
it really chunky this is the 6 cell

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.739 
it really chunky this is the 6 cell
battery<00:01:32.039> so<00:01:32.670> obviously<00:01:33.029> the<00:01:33.209> battery<00:01:33.539> lasts

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:33.749 
battery so obviously the battery lasts

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:36.260 
battery so obviously the battery lasts
I'm<00:01:33.899> not<00:01:33.990> going<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.350> be<00:01:34.499> as<00:01:34.649> good<00:01:34.889> I'd<00:01:35.819> imagine

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
I'm not going to be as good I'd imagine

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.730 
I'm not going to be as good I'd imagine
that<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.450> battery<00:01:36.779> would<00:01:36.899> last<00:01:36.959> about<00:01:37.319> one

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
that the battery would last about one

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.639 
that the battery would last about one
hour<00:01:38.240> Dell<00:01:39.240> are<00:01:39.509> claiming<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.409> nine

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
hour Dell are claiming that the nine

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:43.489 
hour Dell are claiming that the nine
self<00:01:41.009> actually<00:01:41.459> will<00:01:41.609> last<00:01:41.819> seven<00:01:42.450> hours<00:01:42.719> of

00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:43.499 
self actually will last seven hours of

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:46.309 
self actually will last seven hours of
mobile<00:01:43.979> use<00:01:44.399> but<00:01:44.729> doctor<00:01:45.270> for<00:01:45.420> seven<00:01:46.079> hours

00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:46.319 
mobile use but doctor for seven hours

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:48.169 
mobile use but doctor for seven hours
yeah<00:01:46.950> unfortunately<00:01:47.219> we<00:01:47.819> don't<00:01:47.939> have<00:01:48.060> the

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.179 
yeah unfortunately we don't have the

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:50.629 
yeah unfortunately we don't have the
nine<00:01:48.450> cell<00:01:48.749> battery<00:01:49.229> here<00:01:49.439> but<00:01:49.770> I'd<00:01:50.130> be<00:01:50.399> very

00:01:50.629 --> 00:01:50.639 
nine cell battery here but I'd be very

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:52.959 
nine cell battery here but I'd be very
surprised<00:01:51.119> if<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.420> lasts<00:01:51.630> seven<00:01:52.200> hours<00:01:52.349> and

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:52.969 
surprised if it lasts seven hours and

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:56.539 
surprised if it lasts seven hours and
specs<00:01:53.969> wise<00:01:54.209> it's<00:01:54.569> got<00:01:54.749> 120<00:01:55.590> gig<00:01:55.829> hard<00:01:56.369> drive

there<00:03:50.680> in<00:03:51.220> theory<00:03:51.489> it<00:03:51.640> was<00:03:51.700> possible<00:03:52.060> to<00:03:52.120> do

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
there in theory it was possible to do

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:53.490 
there in theory it was possible to do
that<00:03:52.360> without<00:03:52.510> actually<00:03:52.870> turning<00:03:52.989> whatsapp

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
that without actually turning whatsapp

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.380 
that without actually turning whatsapp
on<00:03:53.620> as<00:03:53.920> well<00:03:54.130> so<00:03:54.430> before<00:03:54.820> you<00:03:54.970> have<00:03:55.090> to<00:03:55.209> power

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
on as well so before you have to power

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.910 
on as well so before you have to power
up<00:03:55.450> the<00:03:55.540> whole<00:03:55.750> thing<00:03:55.780> you<00:03:56.440> know<00:03:56.470> be<00:03:56.709> able<00:03:56.830> to

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
up the whole thing you know be able to

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.180 
up the whole thing you know be able to
check<00:03:57.070> if<00:03:57.220> you<00:03:57.340> can<00:03:57.370> get<00:03:57.730> connect

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.740 
check if you can get connect
in<00:03:58.280> the<00:03:58.430> area<00:03:58.700> I<00:03:58.880> actually<00:03:59.210> tried<00:03:59.600> that

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
in the area I actually tried that

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.030 
in the area I actually tried that
several<00:04:00.080> times<00:04:00.110> and<00:04:00.470> I<00:04:00.500> couldn't<00:04:00.800> get<00:04:00.920> that

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
several times and I couldn't get that

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.950 
several times and I couldn't get that
feature<00:04:01.310> to<00:04:01.550> work<00:04:01.580> so<00:04:01.970> I'm<00:04:02.060> not<00:04:02.240> sure<00:04:02.480> I<00:04:02.750> mean

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:02.960 
feature to work so I'm not sure I mean

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.290 
feature to work so I'm not sure I mean
this<00:04:03.230> is<00:04:03.410> admittedly<00:04:03.920> the<00:04:04.190> standard<00:04:04.730> model<00:04:05.090> so

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
this is admittedly the standard model so

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.090 
this is admittedly the standard model so
maybe<00:04:05.540> that<00:04:05.840> feature<00:04:06.080> does<00:04:06.380> come<00:04:06.650> in<00:04:06.830> later

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
maybe that feature does come in later

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.120 
maybe that feature does come in later
with<00:04:07.430> the<00:04:07.520> more<00:04:07.670> expensive<00:04:08.030> models<00:04:08.860> one<00:04:09.860> thing

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
with the more expensive models one thing

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.680 
with the more expensive models one thing
that<00:04:10.310> this<00:04:10.430> model<00:04:10.820> doesn't<00:04:11.000> actually<00:04:11.300> contain

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
that this model doesn't actually contain

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.690 
that this model doesn't actually contain
Charles<00:04:12.440> bit<00:04:12.620> miffed<00:04:12.890> about<00:04:13.010> cuz<00:04:13.370> I<00:04:13.460> really

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
Charles bit miffed about cuz I really

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.930 
Charles bit miffed about cuz I really
wanted<00:04:14.240> to<00:04:14.510> have<00:04:15.260> a<00:04:15.290> fiddle<00:04:15.620> with<00:04:15.770> this<00:04:15.890> and<00:04:16.250> it

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
wanted to have a fiddle with this and it

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.090 
wanted to have a fiddle with this and it
actually<00:04:17.180> has<00:04:17.570> a<00:04:17.810> biometric<00:04:18.100> fingerprint

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
actually has a biometric fingerprint

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:19.930 
actually has a biometric fingerprint
scanner

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
scanner

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.220 
scanner
so<00:04:20.360> normally<00:04:20.870> my<00:04:21.019> point<00:04:21.350> is<00:04:21.620> for<00:04:21.950> it<00:04:22.220> was<00:04:22.400> here

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
so normally my point is for it was here

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.110 
so normally my point is for it was here
so<00:04:24.230> the<00:04:24.620> more<00:04:24.800> expensive<00:04:25.280> models<00:04:25.610> have<00:04:25.790> just

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
so the more expensive models have just

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.780 
so the more expensive models have just
the<00:04:26.330> thing<00:04:26.480> print<00:04:26.750> scanner<00:04:26.990> here<00:04:27.280> you<00:04:28.280> can<00:04:28.460> pop

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
the thing print scanner here you can pop

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.710 
the thing print scanner here you can pop
your<00:04:28.940> finger<00:04:29.360> on<00:04:29.390> to<00:04:29.720> actually<00:04:30.170> and<00:04:30.470> and<00:04:31.720> just

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
your finger on to actually and and just

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.350 
your finger on to actually and and just
securely<00:04:33.110> log<00:04:33.410> into<00:04:33.830> the<00:04:33.950> computer<00:04:34.610> and<00:04:34.820> set

securely log into the computer and set

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.150 
securely log into the computer and set
in<00:04:35.480> those<00:04:35.660> that's<00:04:35.930> actually<00:04:36.260> Hugh<00:04:36.440> accessing

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
in those that's actually Hugh accessing

your top-secret James bonding data just

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.560 
your top-secret James bonding data just
something<00:04:40.190> they<00:04:40.550> cut<00:04:40.730> on<00:04:40.850> BIOS<00:04:41.210> for<00:04:41.450> awhile

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
something they cut on BIOS for awhile

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.090 
something they cut on BIOS for awhile
and<00:04:41.780> things<00:04:41.990> like<00:04:42.080> -<00:04:42.410> I<00:04:42.560> think<00:04:42.590> I've<00:04:42.830> becoming

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
and things like - I think I've becoming

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.860 
and things like - I think I've becoming
more<00:04:43.250> popular<00:04:43.430> but<00:04:44.090> the<00:04:44.210> one<00:04:44.420> thing<00:04:44.660> I<00:04:44.750> was

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
more popular but the one thing I was

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.600 
more popular but the one thing I was
really<00:04:44.990> interested<00:04:45.530> in<00:04:45.650> is<00:04:45.860> that<00:04:46.130> you<00:04:46.460> can

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
really interested in is that you can

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.490 
really interested in is that you can
actually<00:04:46.760> register<00:04:47.420> all<00:04:47.900> five<00:04:48.200> of<00:04:48.230> your

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
actually register all five of your

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.440 
actually register all five of your
fingers<00:04:49.100> so<00:04:49.670> that<00:04:49.700> if<00:04:50.000> you<00:04:50.120> put<00:04:50.150> for<00:04:50.420> instance

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
fingers so that if you put for instance

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.900 
fingers so that if you put for instance
your<00:04:50.930> index<00:04:51.320> finger<00:04:51.710> or<00:04:51.860> your<00:04:51.980> pointer<00:04:52.490> finger

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
your index finger or your pointer finger

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.940 
your index finger or your pointer finger
on<00:04:53.180> there<00:04:53.600> different<00:04:54.290> software<00:04:54.800> will

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
on there different software will

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.280 
on there different software will
actually<00:04:55.430> and<00:04:55.670> start<00:04:56.180> up<00:04:56.420> to<00:04:56.600> prove<00:04:56.840> a<00:04:56.990> lot<00:04:57.020> of

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
actually and start up to prove a lot of

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:58.960 
actually and start up to prove a lot of
things<00:04:57.500> that<00:04:57.650> you<00:04:57.770> put<00:04:57.980> on<00:04:58.130> so<00:04:58.640> you<00:04:58.700> put<00:04:58.940> your

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
things that you put on so you put your

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.090 
things that you put on so you put your
baby<00:04:59.480> finger<00:05:00.260> on<00:05:00.410> and<00:05:00.590> maybe<00:05:00.740> perhaps

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
baby finger on and maybe perhaps

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.240 
baby finger on and maybe perhaps
Microsoft<00:05:02.000> Word<00:05:02.240> will<00:05:02.510> jump<00:05:02.810> up

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
Microsoft Word will jump up

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.810 
Microsoft Word will jump up
pointer<00:05:04.250> finger<00:05:04.640> save<00:05:05.180> MSN<00:05:05.960> Messenger<00:05:06.820> index

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
pointer finger save MSN Messenger index

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.090 
pointer finger save MSN Messenger index
finger<00:05:08.330> Internet<00:05:08.990> so<00:05:09.500> I<00:05:09.530> think<00:05:09.620> that<00:05:09.890> you<00:05:09.980> can

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
finger Internet so I think that you can

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.980 
finger Internet so I think that you can
actually<00:05:10.430> customize<00:05:10.640> it<00:05:11.180> that<00:05:11.330> way<00:05:11.480> so<00:05:11.540> I'd

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
actually customize it that way so I'd

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.330 
actually customize it that way so I'd
love<00:05:12.230> to<00:05:12.290> have<00:05:12.530> a<00:05:12.590> go<00:05:12.800> with<00:05:12.830> that<00:05:13.100> but

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
love to have a go with that but

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.130 
love to have a go with that but
unfortunately<00:05:13.490> this<00:05:14.090> model<00:05:14.480> doesn't<00:05:14.660> contain

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
unfortunately this model doesn't contain

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.640 
unfortunately this model doesn't contain
that<00:05:15.700> actually<00:05:16.700> the<00:05:16.910> more<00:05:17.060> expensive<00:05:17.510> ones<00:05:18.020> or

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
that actually the more expensive ones or

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.240 
that actually the more expensive ones or
is<00:05:18.800> it<00:05:18.950> and<00:05:19.570> now<00:05:20.570> as<00:05:21.050> we<00:05:21.200> mentioned<00:05:21.590> earlier<00:05:21.710> in

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
is it and now as we mentioned earlier in

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.430 
is it and now as we mentioned earlier in
the<00:05:22.460> video<00:05:22.610> and<00:05:23.150> Dell<00:05:23.540> are<00:05:23.690> really<00:05:23.990> pushing

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
the video and Dell are really pushing

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.400 
the video and Dell are really pushing
for<00:05:24.770> how<00:05:25.660> aesthetically<00:05:26.660> pleasing<00:05:26.690> this

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
for how aesthetically pleasing this

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.050 
for how aesthetically pleasing this
range<00:05:27.680> of<00:05:27.830> laptops<00:05:28.220> are<00:05:28.430> I<00:05:28.610> mean<00:05:28.730> that's<00:05:28.910> what

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
range of laptops are I mean that's what

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.460 
range of laptops are I mean that's what
it's<00:05:29.150> all<00:05:29.330> about<00:05:29.360> when<00:05:29.630> I<00:05:29.720> spoke<00:05:30.050> to<00:05:32.290> when<00:05:33.290> this

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
it's all about when I spoke to when this

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.770 
it's all about when I spoke to when this
was<00:05:33.680> released<00:05:34.000> along<00:05:35.000> with<00:05:35.030> the<00:05:35.210> inspiron<00:05:35.630> and

have my doll which i think is another

point<00:05:45.800> I<00:05:46.040> mean<00:05:46.250> I<00:05:46.340> think<00:05:46.400> that<00:05:46.610> was<00:05:46.700> the<00:05:46.760> first

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
point I mean I think that was the first

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.600 
point I mean I think that was the first
to<00:05:47.000> admit<00:05:47.150> is<00:05:47.300> not<00:05:47.510> really<00:05:47.750> the<00:05:47.870> market<00:05:48.200> though

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
to admit is not really the market though

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.340 
to admit is not really the market though
I<00:05:49.610> think<00:05:50.000> that<00:05:50.300> if<00:05:50.390> Dell<00:05:50.630> can<00:05:50.840> improve<00:05:51.169> on

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.350 
I think that if Dell can improve on

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.290 
I think that if Dell can improve on
their<00:05:51.500> image<00:05:51.919> and<00:05:52.160> perhaps<00:05:52.669> target<00:05:53.210> the

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
their image and perhaps target the

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.720 
their image and perhaps target the
laptop<00:05:53.690> storage<00:05:53.990> people<00:05:54.440> our<00:05:54.800> own<00:05:54.830> age<00:05:55.160> rather

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:55.730 
laptop storage people our own age rather

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.240 
laptop storage people our own age rather
than<00:05:56.000> maybe<00:05:56.240> our<00:05:56.570> fuddy-duddy<00:05:57.230> mothers<00:05:57.980> and

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
than maybe our fuddy-duddy mothers and

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.790 
than maybe our fuddy-duddy mothers and
then<00:05:58.910> they<00:05:59.060> would<00:05:59.450> be<00:05:59.600> quite<00:05:59.840> successful<00:06:00.050> and

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 
then they would be quite successful and

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.550 
then they would be quite successful and
I<00:06:00.980> mean<00:06:01.310> this<00:06:01.400> is<00:06:01.580> a<00:06:01.610> really<00:06:01.880> nice<00:06:02.060> color

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560
