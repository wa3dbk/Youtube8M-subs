 and various modeling tools 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.230
 we learned to create this dirigible from 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.530
 zero 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.949
 textured create the controllers and already 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.980
 We know the various tools of 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:44.830
 mesh both animation and 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.440
 texturization as well as the main ones 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:53.080
 elements that make up the mesh for 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:55.089
 work in a fast way ok and up 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.190

 this course we are simply going to put together the 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.440
 final video we go to the folder 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.940
 images we have the render since then 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.250
 I got the render with view you give 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.680
 mind that it has much more quality and 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.980
 right here we have our render with 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.780

 with the extra lesson to get this 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.790
 this quality in the render ok you give 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.830
