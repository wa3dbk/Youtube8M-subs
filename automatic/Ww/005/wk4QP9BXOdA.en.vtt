00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
I'm trying to think for the weapons I

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.560 
I'm trying to think for the weapons I
think<00:02:13.440> I'm<00:02:13.560> mulcher<00:02:13.950> songs<00:02:14.400> up<00:02:14.700> top<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.390> near

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
think I'm mulcher songs up top and near

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.650 
think I'm mulcher songs up top and near
the<00:02:15.600> stands<00:02:16.350> and<00:02:16.760> torque<00:02:17.760> bow<00:02:17.970> swans<00:02:18.390> in<00:02:18.540> the

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
the stands and torque bow swans in the

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.690 
the stands and torque bow swans in the
middle<00:02:18.960> but<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.320> can<00:02:19.560> shoot<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:19.920> scoreboard

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
middle but you can shoot the scoreboard

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.150 
middle but you can shoot the scoreboard
down<00:02:20.940> if<00:02:21.210> you<00:02:21.900> shoot<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.290> wires<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:22.920> it<00:02:23.010> can

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
down if you shoot the wires and it can

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.270 
down if you shoot the wires and it can
fall<00:02:23.400> down<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:23.850> likes<00:02:24.000> like<00:02:24.630> completely<00:02:25.280> rape

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
fall down and likes like completely rape

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.700 
fall down and likes like completely rape
somebody<00:02:26.670> but<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:28.020> thing<00:02:28.230> is<00:02:28.260> when<00:02:28.590> the

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
somebody but the thing is when the

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.250 
somebody but the thing is when the
scoreboard<00:02:29.490> does<00:02:29.760> fall<00:02:30.090> you<00:02:30.600> don't<00:02:31.080> have

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
scoreboard does fall you don't have

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.310 
scoreboard does fall you don't have
access<00:02:31.470> for<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.130> middle<00:02:32.430> weapon<00:02:32.790> anymore<00:02:33.320> I

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
access for the middle weapon anymore I

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.230 
access for the middle weapon anymore I
think<00:02:34.830> it<00:02:34.920> would<00:02:35.010> have<00:02:35.100> been<00:02:35.190> cool<00:02:35.490> to<00:02:35.760> add<00:02:35.910> add

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
think it would have been cool to add add

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.420 
think it would have been cool to add add
like<00:02:36.660> a<00:02:36.690> little<00:02:36.810> door<00:02:37.500> because<00:02:37.800> usually<00:02:38.100> they

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
like a little door because usually they

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.120 
like a little door because usually they
have<00:02:38.510> little<00:02:39.510> doors<00:02:39.900> on<00:02:40.140> scoreboards<00:02:40.530> in<00:02:40.950> case

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
have little doors on scoreboards in case

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.220 
have little doors on scoreboards in case
they<00:02:41.310> have<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.550> fix<00:02:41.760> something<00:02:42.060> inside<00:02:42.570> so

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
they have to fix something inside so

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.330 
they have to fix something inside so
that<00:02:43.320> would<00:02:43.440> have<00:02:43.530> been<00:02:43.590> pretty<00:02:43.860> cool<00:02:44.190> but

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
that would have been pretty cool but

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.440 
that would have been pretty cool but
then<00:02:44.520> I<00:02:44.550> think<00:02:44.880> people<00:02:45.030> would<00:02:45.240> have<00:02:45.360> been

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
then I think people would have been

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.330 
then I think people would have been
camping<00:02:45.900> in<00:02:46.020> their<00:02:46.230> show<00:02:46.470> at<00:02:46.740> the<00:02:46.860> same<00:02:47.070> time<00:02:47.280> I

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
camping in their show at the same time I

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.510 
camping in their show at the same time I
can<00:02:47.640> see<00:02:47.820> why<00:02:47.940> they<00:02:48.150> didn't<00:02:48.360> do<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.740> but<00:02:49.740> um<00:02:50.010> I

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
can see why they didn't do it but um I

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.200 
can see why they didn't do it but um I
think<00:02:51.090> I<00:02:51.390> finish<00:02:51.750> this<00:02:51.780> game<00:02:52.280> 17<00:02:53.280> in<00:02:53.310> three<00:02:53.940> and

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
think I finish this game 17 in three and

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.000 
think I finish this game 17 in three and
I<00:02:54.510> get<00:02:54.720> a<00:02:54.750> little<00:02:54.930> bit<00:02:55.170> of<00:02:55.200> double<00:02:55.710> barrel

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
I get a little bit of double barrel

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.860 
I get a little bit of double barrel
shotgun<00:02:56.040> gameplay<00:02:57.030> in<00:02:57.210> towards<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:57.660> end

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
shotgun gameplay in towards the end

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.440 
shotgun gameplay in towards the end
because<00:02:58.590> I<00:02:58.770> think<00:02:59.040> I<00:02:59.130> started<00:02:59.489> getting<00:02:59.610> like<00:03:00.180> I

takes like I want to say a quarter of a
clip<00:03:28.139> to<00:03:28.170> down<00:03:28.469> somebody<00:03:28.950> so<00:03:29.189> people<00:03:29.669> have

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
clip to down somebody so people have

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.610 
clip to down somebody so people have
been<00:03:29.939> just<00:03:30.180> spraying<00:03:30.569> it<00:03:30.810> and<00:03:30.989> like<00:03:31.200> walking

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
been just spraying it and like walking

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.159 
been just spraying it and like walking
around<00:03:31.739> and<00:03:32.099> hip<00:03:32.370> firing<00:03:32.669> it<00:03:32.999> and<00:03:33.180> it's<00:03:33.959> really

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:34.169 
around and hip firing it and it's really

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:36.920 
around and hip firing it and it's really
hard<00:03:34.290> you<00:03:34.709> just<00:03:34.739> you<00:03:35.219> go<00:03:35.400> from<00:03:35.669> one<00:03:36.359> point<00:03:36.629> into

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
hard you just you go from one point into

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.599 
hard you just you go from one point into
four<00:03:37.200> pointed<00:03:37.560> in<00:03:37.680> like<00:03:37.919> literally<00:03:38.250> one

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
four pointed in like literally one

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.330 
four pointed in like literally one
second<00:03:39.150> so<00:03:40.049> I<00:03:40.079> think<00:03:40.409> they<00:03:40.650> need<00:03:40.829> to<00:03:40.859> take<00:03:41.129> down

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
second so I think they need to take down

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.640 
second so I think they need to take down
the<00:03:41.519> damage<00:03:41.939> a<00:03:42.030> little<00:03:42.239> bit<00:03:42.389> on<00:03:42.540> that<00:03:42.650> other

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
the damage a little bit on that other

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.129 
the damage a little bit on that other
than<00:03:44.040> that<00:03:44.280> those<00:03:44.969> other<00:03:45.269> two<00:03:45.540> problems<00:03:45.959> that

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
than that those other two problems that

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:47.839 
than that those other two problems that
I<00:03:46.169> had<00:03:46.409> in<00:03:46.560> my<00:03:46.650> first<00:03:46.919> commentary<00:03:47.489> are<00:03:47.730> the

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
I had in my first commentary are the

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.179 
I had in my first commentary are the
pretty<00:03:48.060> much<00:03:48.299> the<00:03:48.659> only<00:03:48.930> two<00:03:49.409> things<00:03:49.650> I've<00:03:49.919> had

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:50.189 
pretty much the only two things I've had

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:52.459 
pretty much the only two things I've had
on<00:03:50.489> wrong<00:03:51.480> with<00:03:51.689> the<00:03:51.810> game<00:03:52.019> you<00:03:52.199> know<00:03:52.290> the

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:52.469 
on wrong with the game you know the

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:54.050 
on wrong with the game you know the
double<00:03:52.739> barrel<00:03:53.010> and<00:03:53.099> I<00:03:53.189> think<00:03:53.219> the<00:03:53.489> digger<00:03:53.730> is

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
double barrel and I think the digger is

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.009 
double barrel and I think the digger is
a<00:03:54.120> little<00:03:54.870> too<00:03:55.019> strong<00:03:55.760> put<00:03:56.760> on<00:03:56.939> I'm<00:03:57.180> talk<00:03:57.510> like

a little too strong put on I'm talk like

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.360 
a little too strong put on I'm talk like
a<00:03:58.049> lot<00:03:58.290> of<00:03:58.409> my<00:03:58.500> friends<00:03:58.709> have<00:03:58.829> been<00:03:58.919> telling<00:03:59.189> me

that they loved that thing because it is

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.490 
that they loved that thing because it is
kind<00:04:02.069> of<00:04:02.129> fun<00:04:02.340> at<00:04:02.489> you<00:04:02.849> when<00:04:03.780> you<00:04:03.870> aim<00:04:04.109> it<00:04:04.139> it's

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
kind of got a thing where it shows where

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.429 
kind of got a thing where it shows where
it's<00:04:06.359> going<00:04:06.480> to<00:04:06.510> go<00:04:06.599> underneath<00:04:07.019> the<00:04:07.290> ground

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:07.439 
it's going to go underneath the ground

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:09.890 
it's going to go underneath the ground
and<00:04:08.220> you<00:04:08.310> shoot<00:04:08.579> it<00:04:08.729> and<00:04:08.849> goes<00:04:09.030> under<00:04:09.449> and<00:04:09.479> I've

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
and you shoot it and goes under and I've

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.039 
and you shoot it and goes under and I've
seen<00:04:10.169> people<00:04:10.319> get<00:04:10.590> in<00:04:10.739> quads<00:04:11.069> and<00:04:11.689> like<00:04:12.689> three

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
seen people get in quads and like three

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:14.899 
seen people get in quads and like three
kills<00:04:13.319> it<00:04:13.590> would<00:04:13.709> one<00:04:13.979> day<00:04:14.189> ger<00:04:14.340> it's<00:04:14.519> actually

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:14.909 
kills it would one day ger it's actually

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:17.870 
kills it would one day ger it's actually
pretty<00:04:15.090> exciting<00:04:15.720> but<00:04:15.930> i<00:04:15.959> think<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.880> splash

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
pretty exciting but i think the splash

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.810 
pretty exciting but i think the splash
damage<00:04:18.209> is<00:04:18.509> way<00:04:18.659> too<00:04:18.720> big<00:04:19.079> um<00:04:19.370> as<00:04:20.370> for<00:04:20.729> the

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
damage is way too big um as for the

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.140 
damage is way too big um as for the
grenades<00:04:21.359> I<00:04:21.889> been<00:04:22.889> killed<00:04:23.190> by<00:04:23.400> grenades<00:04:23.849> that

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
grenades I been killed by grenades that

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
haven't even been close to me somewhat

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:28.460 
haven't even been close to me somewhat
like<00:04:26.159> gears<00:04:26.460> too<00:04:26.729> but<00:04:27.389> for<00:04:27.630> some<00:04:27.960> reason<00:04:28.320> when

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
like gears too but for some reason when

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.529

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
at first i didn't even know it was

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.230 
at first i didn't even know it was
claiming<00:04:44.250> it<00:04:44.520> looked<00:04:44.699> like<00:04:44.849> it<00:04:45.030> was<00:04:45.120> just

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
claiming it looked like it was just

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.570 
claiming it looked like it was just
colored<00:04:46.050> like<00:04:46.560> a<00:04:46.590> bright<00:04:47.039> yellow<00:04:47.250> or

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
colored like a bright yellow or

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.700 
colored like a bright yellow or
something<00:04:48.030> some<00:04:48.300> kind<00:04:48.449> of<00:04:48.570> skin<00:04:48.840> but<00:04:49.680> i

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
something some kind of skin but i

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.830 
something some kind of skin but i
haven't<00:04:50.219> gotten<00:04:50.400> any<00:04:50.610> skins<00:04:51.000> on<00:04:51.150> my<00:04:51.300> shotguns

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
haven't gotten any skins on my shotguns

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.390 
haven't gotten any skins on my shotguns
yet<00:04:52.080> i've<00:04:52.289> seen<00:04:52.560> people<00:04:52.740> running<00:04:53.159> her

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
yet i've seen people running her

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.890 
yet i've seen people running her
women<00:04:53.759> but<00:04:53.940> I<00:04:54.120> think<00:04:54.419> you<00:04:54.509> need<00:04:54.630> to<00:04:54.690> get<00:04:54.870> a

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
women but I think you need to get a

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.570 
women but I think you need to get a
certain<00:04:55.290> amount<00:04:55.350> of<00:04:55.680> pills<00:04:56.100> or<00:04:56.400> something

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
certain amount of pills or something

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.840 
certain amount of pills or something
like<00:04:57.030> that<00:04:57.090> but<00:04:57.479> I<00:04:57.630> already<00:04:57.870> have<00:04:58.020> like<00:04:58.580> 200<00:04:59.580> to

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
like that but I already have like 200 to

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.300 
like that but I already have like 200 to
300<00:05:00.509> kills<00:05:00.750> so<00:05:01.080> I<00:05:01.290> don't<00:05:01.919> think<00:05:02.070> that's<00:05:02.220> the

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
300 kills so I don't think that's the

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.950 
300 kills so I don't think that's the
case<00:05:02.400> it<00:05:02.820> might<00:05:03.030> be<00:05:03.210> playing<00:05:03.630> a<00:05:03.780> different

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
case it might be playing a different

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.400 
case it might be playing a different
game<00:05:04.229> type<00:05:04.770> and<00:05:05.180> that's<00:05:06.180> a<00:05:06.300> look<00:05:06.479> at<00:05:06.720> the<00:05:06.930> first

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
game type and that's a look at the first

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.770 
game type and that's a look at the first
person<00:05:07.919> with<00:05:08.160> the<00:05:08.370> hamburgers<00:05:08.970> I<00:05:09.270> absolutely
