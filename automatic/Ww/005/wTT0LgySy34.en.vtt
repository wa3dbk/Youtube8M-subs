to<00:00:57.870> modern<00:00:58.199> rise<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.710> know<00:00:58.859> lower<00:00:59.460> profile<00:01:00.000> a

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
to modern rise you know lower profile a

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.420 
to modern rise you know lower profile a
little<00:01:00.809> easier<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.320> adjust<00:01:01.379> plus<00:01:02.100> it's<00:01:02.309> those

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
little easier to adjust plus it's those

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.250 
little easier to adjust plus it's those
15<00:01:02.850> 20<00:01:03.120> yards<00:01:03.210> rather<00:01:03.539> than<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.809> old<00:01:03.960> one<00:01:04.110> and

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
15 20 yards rather than the old one and

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.960 
15 20 yards rather than the old one and
that's<00:01:04.680> sort<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.159> big<00:01:05.339> deal<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.760> know

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
that's sort of a big deal you know

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.780 
that's sort of a big deal you know
but<00:01:06.320> this<00:01:07.320> particular<00:01:07.710> one<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.340> one<00:01:08.729> that

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
but this particular one is the one that

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.940 
but this particular one is the one that
I<00:01:09.000> like<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.479> best<00:01:09.510> because<00:01:10.080> there's<00:01:10.500> 21

feel explain that to us well what
happens<00:01:49.729> infinite<00:01:50.729> reverse<00:01:51.119> is<00:01:51.420> actually

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
happens infinite reverse is actually

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.609 
happens infinite reverse is actually
clutch<00:01:53.189> brains<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:54.390> right<00:01:55.290> on<00:01:55.470> the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
with your rod it's not like a jig or a

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.710 
with your rod it's not like a jig or a
worm<00:02:05.850> where<00:02:06.090> you're<00:02:06.210> pulling<00:02:06.480> it<00:02:06.630> up<00:02:06.690> and

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
worm where you're pulling it up and

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.570 
worm where you're pulling it up and
you're<00:02:06.900> feeling<00:02:07.200> with<00:02:07.320> raffia<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:08.010> crane<00:02:08.250> baton

you're feeling with raffia a crane baton

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.830 
you're feeling with raffia a crane baton
you're<00:02:08.670> sitting<00:02:08.970> there<00:02:09.060> cranking<00:02:09.480> your<00:02:09.630> rods

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
you're sitting there cranking your rods

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.870 
you're sitting there cranking your rods
moving<00:02:10.350> so<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:10.860> have<00:02:11.070> to<00:02:11.190> feel<00:02:11.400> most<00:02:11.670> of<00:02:11.820> the

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
moving so you have to feel most of the

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.240 
moving so you have to feel most of the
movement<00:02:12.240> through<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.420> reel<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:13.100> with<00:02:14.100> that

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
movement through the reel and with that

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.730 
movement through the reel and with that
clutch<00:02:14.550> out<00:02:14.940> of<00:02:15.150> it<00:02:15.420> it<00:02:15.870> allows<00:02:16.110> that<00:02:16.410> feel<00:02:16.590> to

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
clutch out of it it allows that feel to

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.170 
clutch out of it it allows that feel to
come<00:02:16.950> through<00:02:17.130> your<00:02:17.280> line<00:02:17.490> into<00:02:17.730> your<00:02:17.880> reel

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
fish there you could tell they head swim

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.030 
fish there you could tell they head swim
off<00:02:30.570> and<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:30.870> were<00:02:30.990> losing<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.500> wobble<00:02:31.920> of

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
off and you were losing the wobble of

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.100 
off and you were losing the wobble of
your<00:02:32.160> crankbait<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:32.790> that<00:02:33.270> mystified<00:02:33.810> me<00:02:33.840> at

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
your crankbait and that mystified me at

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.900 
your crankbait and that mystified me at
that<00:02:34.230> time<00:02:34.440> it<00:02:34.620> was<00:02:34.740> like<00:02:34.770> how<00:02:35.490> does<00:02:35.550> he<00:02:35.760> know

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
that time it was like how does he know

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.550 
that time it was like how does he know
that<00:02:35.940> how<00:02:36.270> does<00:02:36.330> he<00:02:36.510> feel<00:02:36.690> that<00:02:36.720> this<00:02:37.200> is<00:02:37.380> what

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
that how does he feel that this is what

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.020 
that how does he feel that this is what
that<00:02:37.710> rule<00:02:37.890> allows<00:02:38.190> you<00:02:38.400> to<00:02:38.550> do<00:02:38.670> right

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
that rule allows you to do right

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.070 
that rule allows you to do right

absolutely
yeah<00:02:40.260> it<00:02:40.470> does<00:02:40.740> and<00:02:41.040> plus<00:02:41.280> without<00:02:42.060> the

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
yeah it does and plus without the

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.090 
yeah it does and plus without the
bearing<00:02:42.630> too<00:02:42.780> it<00:02:43.110> really<00:02:43.140> helps<00:02:43.740> you<00:02:43.830> throw<00:02:44.070> a

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
bearing too it really helps you throw a

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.680 
bearing too it really helps you throw a
little<00:02:44.520> bit<00:02:44.730> further<00:02:45.000> even<00:02:45.330> though<00:02:45.450> other

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
little bit further even though other

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.140 
little bit further even though other
baby<00:02:46.080> ones<00:02:46.290> are<00:02:46.500> good<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:47.310> one<00:02:47.490> without<00:02:47.730> it

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
baby ones are good the one without it

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.850 
baby ones are good the one without it
will<00:02:48.270> actually<00:02:48.450> maybe<00:02:48.990> throw<00:02:49.230> three<00:02:49.560> four<00:02:49.770> or

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
will actually maybe throw three four or

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.160 
will actually maybe throw three four or
five<00:02:49.920> yards<00:02:50.250> further<00:02:50.520> right<00:02:51.030> you'll<00:02:51.930> see

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
five yards further right you'll see

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.080 
five yards further right you'll see
you'll<00:02:52.530> see<00:02:52.620> two<00:02:52.950> guys<00:02:53.100> in<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.370> bow<00:02:53.550> and<00:02:53.880> one
