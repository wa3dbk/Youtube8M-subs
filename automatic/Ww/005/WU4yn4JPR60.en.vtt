drain<00:03:58.500> because<00:03:58.950> you<00:03:59.099> know<00:03:59.220> it<00:03:59.340> makes<00:03:59.459> for<00:03:59.639> is

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
drain because you know it makes for is

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.280 
drain because you know it makes for is
unaffected<00:03:59.940> by<00:04:00.090> traps<00:04:00.359> so<00:04:00.900> this<00:04:00.989> will<00:04:01.109> just

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
unaffected by traps so this will just

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.240 
unaffected by traps so this will just

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
make it what you're its opponent's

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.830 
make it what you're its opponent's
problem<00:04:02.579> and<00:04:02.790> only<00:04:03.030> that<00:04:03.329> people<00:04:03.660> that<00:04:03.720> are

wandering skill drain effect does not

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.699 
wandering skill drain effect does not

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
negate the effects of the aims in cards

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.229 
negate the effects of the aims in cards
they<00:04:07.980> can<00:04:08.160> still<00:04:08.430> summon<00:04:08.730> each<00:04:08.880> other<00:04:09.060> when

stop<00:04:11.190> that<00:04:11.400> so<00:04:11.790> it<00:04:12.209> works<00:04:12.540> pretty<00:04:12.690> well<00:04:12.840> with

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
stop that so it works pretty well with

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.349 
stop that so it works pretty well with
this<00:04:13.169> art<00:04:13.380> type<00:04:13.560> then<00:04:14.519> after<00:04:14.730> that<00:04:14.819> we<00:04:14.970> have<00:04:15.180> to
