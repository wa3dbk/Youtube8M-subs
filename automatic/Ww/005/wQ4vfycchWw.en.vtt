00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:10.569 
Kings you know I usually feel that if

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:12.749 
Kings you know I usually feel that if
the<00:05:10.960> start<00:05:11.409> of<00:05:11.560> the<00:05:11.650> cast<00:05:11.889> the<00:05:12.190> transition

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:12.759 
the start of the cast the transition

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:15.689 
the start of the cast the transition
between<00:05:12.880> April<00:05:13.479> and<00:05:13.569> I<00:05:13.720> goes<00:05:14.020> well<00:05:14.400> then<00:05:15.400> it's

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:15.699 
between April and I goes well then it's

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:17.939 
between April and I goes well then it's
usually<00:05:15.970> a<00:05:16.180> good<00:05:16.389> cast<00:05:16.690> this<00:05:17.349> one<00:05:17.500> was<00:05:17.650> okay<00:05:17.860> in

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:17.949 
usually a good cast this one was okay in

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:21.120 
usually a good cast this one was okay in
terms<00:05:18.039> of<00:05:18.310> how<00:05:18.759> I<00:05:18.789> performed<00:05:19.599> it<00:05:20.169> was<00:05:20.289> good<00:05:20.530> it

was<00:05:21.280> pretty<00:05:21.610> close<00:05:21.849> but<00:05:22.210> here's<00:05:23.169> proof<00:05:23.530> that<00:05:24.370> I

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
was pretty close but here's proof that I

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.790 
was pretty close but here's proof that I
will<00:05:24.759> be<00:05:24.940> on<00:05:25.240> the<00:05:25.449> ferry<00:05:25.780> you<00:05:26.319> can<00:05:26.560> probably
