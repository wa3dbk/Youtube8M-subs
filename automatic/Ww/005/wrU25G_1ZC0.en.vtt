it was very excited this year at NAB

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.650 
it was very excited this year at NAB
2010<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.859> be<00:00:26.010> showing<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.609> new<00:00:27.029> compass<00:00:27.390> range

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
2010 to be showing the new compass range

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.560 
2010 to be showing the new compass range
of<00:00:28.199> fluid<00:00:28.619> heads<00:00:28.800> there<00:00:29.670> are<00:00:29.759> three<00:00:29.970> models<00:00:30.300> to

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
of fluid heads there are three models to

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.140 
of fluid heads there are three models to
choose<00:00:30.810> from<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.859> model<00:00:32.189> 15<00:00:32.640> 20<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.720> 25<00:00:34.530> and

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.150 
choose from the model 15 20 and 25 and

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.510 
choose from the model 15 20 and 25 and
if<00:00:36.150> I<00:00:36.300> start<00:00:36.600> firstly<00:00:36.960> with<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.260> compass<00:00:38.130> 15

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
if I start firstly with the compass 15

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.000 
if I start firstly with the compass 15
the<00:00:39.060> compass<00:00:39.390> 15<00:00:39.690> has<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.900> payload<00:00:40.290> range<00:00:40.560> of

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
the compass 15 has a payload range of

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.090 
the compass 15 has a payload range of
three<00:00:41.730> pounds<00:00:42.240> through<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.110> 20<00:00:43.980> pounds<00:00:44.130> and<00:00:46.100> it

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
three pounds through to 20 pounds and it

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.620 
three pounds through to 20 pounds and it
offers<00:00:47.310> a<00:00:47.400> range<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.700> features<00:00:47.910> including

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:48.630 
offers a range of features including

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.160 
offers a range of features including
five<00:00:49.260> positions<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:50.210> drag<00:00:51.210> in<00:00:51.420> both<00:00:51.600> pan<00:00:51.930> and

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
five positions of drag in both pan and

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.810 
five positions of drag in both pan and
tilt<00:00:52.380> and<00:00:52.590> four<00:00:53.280> positions<00:00:53.700> of

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
tilt and four positions of

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.350 
tilt and four positions of
counterbalance<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:55.340> offers<00:00:56.340> very<00:00:56.670> very<00:00:56.940> very

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
counterbalance it offers very very very

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.950 
counterbalance it offers very very very
smooth<00:00:57.800> performance<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.480> is<00:01:00.480> particularly

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
smooth performance and is particularly

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.160 
smooth performance and is particularly
suited<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.620> emerging<00:01:02.100> range<00:01:02.310> of<00:01:02.520> DSLR

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
suited to the emerging range of DSLR

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.469 
suited to the emerging range of DSLR
cameras<00:01:04.250> which<00:01:05.250> are<00:01:05.460> very<00:01:05.729> sort<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.060> critical

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
cameras which are very sort of critical

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.419 
cameras which are very sort of critical
in<00:01:06.659> terms<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.350> looking<00:01:07.950> for<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.219> really

00:01:08.419 --> 00:01:08.429 
in terms of looking for that really

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:11.510 
in terms of looking for that really
really<00:01:08.850> really<00:01:09.060> really<00:01:09.210> smooth<00:01:10.109> pan<00:01:10.520> movement

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
really really really smooth pan movement

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.609 
really really really smooth pan movement
to<00:01:12.329> complement<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:12.840> we<00:01:13.079> have<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.320> compass

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
to complement that we have the compass

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.569 
to complement that we have the compass
20<00:01:13.950> which<00:01:14.939> offers<00:01:15.320> increased<00:01:16.320> payload<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:17.429> it

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:17.579 
20 which offers increased payload so it

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:21.230 
20 which offers increased payload so it
goes<00:01:17.789> through<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.420> 25<00:01:19.380> pounds<00:01:19.549> and<00:01:20.549> also<00:01:21.060> has

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
goes through to 25 pounds and also has

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.330 
goes through to 25 pounds and also has
five<00:01:21.570> positions<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.229> drag<00:01:22.530> for<00:01:22.799> pan<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.159> tilt

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
five positions of drag for pan and tilt

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.669 
five positions of drag for pan and tilt
and<00:01:23.520> four<00:01:24.179> positions<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.719> counterbalance<00:01:25.350> and

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:25.679 
and four positions of counterbalance and

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:29.959 
and four positions of counterbalance and
then<00:01:26.609> beyond<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.539> we<00:01:28.229> have<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.590> compass<00:01:29.070> 25

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:29.969 
then beyond that we have the compass 25

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:32.809 
then beyond that we have the compass 25
which<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.020> hundred<00:01:31.679> millimeter<00:01:32.009> system<00:01:32.429> and

00:01:32.809 --> 00:01:32.819 
which is a hundred millimeter system and

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:35.719 
which is a hundred millimeter system and
it<00:01:33.270> has<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.780> offers<00:01:34.140> payload<00:01:34.530> range<00:01:34.770> up<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.340> 30

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
it has it offers payload range up to 30

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.230 
it has it offers payload range up to 30
pounds<00:01:35.999> and<00:01:36.390> again<00:01:36.929> five<00:01:37.590> positions<00:01:38.039> of<00:01:38.240> drag

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
pounds and again five positions of drag

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.260 
pounds and again five positions of drag
in<00:01:39.810> pan<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.649> tilt<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.039> poor<00:01:41.759> positions<00:01:42.179> of

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
in pan and tilt and poor positions of

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.270 
in pan and tilt and poor positions of
counterbalance<00:01:42.869> so<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.649> combination<00:01:43.859> of

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
counterbalance so the combination of

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.099 
counterbalance so the combination of
these<00:01:44.399> three<00:01:44.460> heads<00:01:44.969> is<00:01:45.329> actually<00:01:45.719> a<00:01:45.749> very<00:01:45.899> new

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:46.109 
these three heads is actually a very new

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:48.349 
these three heads is actually a very new
exciting<00:01:46.530> addition<00:01:47.039> to<00:01:47.609> the<00:01:47.909> miller<00:01:48.119> range

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:48.359 
exciting addition to the miller range

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:50.959 
exciting addition to the miller range
and<00:01:48.689> it's<00:01:49.409> very<00:01:49.679> much<00:01:49.770> targeted<00:01:50.369> at<00:01:50.490> the

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:50.969 
and it's very much targeted at the

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:52.660 
and it's very much targeted at the
emerging

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
emerging

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.780 
emerging
DSLR<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.970> then<00:01:54.479> hdv<00:01:55.110> market<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.130> sony<00:01:56.369> x10

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
DSLR and then hdv market so the sony x10

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.100 
DSLR and then hdv market so the sony x10
es<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:58.110> jvc<00:01:58.680> 700<00:01:59.340> s<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.549> then<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.119> new<00:02:00.840> sony

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
es the jvc 700 s and then the new sony

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.710 
es the jvc 700 s and then the new sony
350<00:02:01.710> s<00:02:01.770> etc<00:02:01.920> are<00:02:02.640> all<00:02:02.700> going<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.149> be<00:02:03.240> very<00:02:03.479> well

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
350 s etc are all going to be very well

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.549 
350 s etc are all going to be very well
suited<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:04.259> range<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.979> fluid<00:02:05.369> heads
