to the reason why this is going to help
you<00:03:21.330> in<00:03:21.510> your<00:03:21.540> reaction<00:03:22.020> time<00:03:22.140> just<00:03:23.130> think<00:03:23.340> of

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
you in your reaction time just think of

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.390 
you in your reaction time just think of
the<00:03:24.150> one<00:03:24.420> second<00:03:24.960> being<00:03:25.260> at<00:03:25.410> your<00:03:25.590> huge<00:03:26.070> turtle

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
the one second being at your huge turtle

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.300 
the one second being at your huge turtle
show<00:03:26.730> and<00:03:27.110> this<00:03:28.110> huge<00:03:28.350> turtle<00:03:28.650> show<00:03:28.920> will<00:03:29.100> of

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
show and this huge turtle show will of

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.980 
show and this huge turtle show will of
course<00:03:29.670> increase<00:03:30.330> your<00:03:30.480> reaction<00:03:30.840> time

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
course increase your reaction time

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.630 
course increase your reaction time
because<00:03:31.230> after<00:03:31.590> you<00:03:31.680> do<00:03:31.830> these<00:03:32.010> lessons<00:03:32.430> for

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
because after you do these lessons for

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.880 
because after you do these lessons for
maybe<00:03:32.760> about<00:03:32.910> two<00:03:33.150> games<00:03:33.470> you<00:03:34.470> will<00:03:34.590> feel<00:03:34.860> the

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
maybe about two games you will feel the

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.710 
maybe about two games you will feel the
difference<00:03:35.070> you'll<00:03:35.550> be<00:03:35.670> like<00:03:35.820> man<00:03:36.060> since<00:03:36.600> I

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
difference you'll be like man since I

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.330 
difference you'll be like man since I
don't<00:03:36.780> have<00:03:36.900> that<00:03:36.989> one<00:03:37.170> second<00:03:37.860> delay<00:03:38.130> and

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
don't have that one second delay and

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.070 
don't have that one second delay and
where<00:03:38.580> I<00:03:38.610> or<00:03:39.030> you<00:03:39.239> know<00:03:39.360> where<00:03:39.570> I<00:03:39.600> have<00:03:39.690> to<00:03:39.720> wait

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
where I or you know where I have to wait

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.050 
where I or you know where I have to wait
to<00:03:40.380> actually<00:03:40.500> shoot<00:03:40.830> someone<00:03:41.160> I<00:03:41.370> could<00:03:41.790> just

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
to actually shoot someone I could just

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.850 
to actually shoot someone I could just
snap<00:03:42.360> to<00:03:42.600> this<00:03:42.750> guy<00:03:42.900> as<00:03:43.080> fast<00:03:43.320> as<00:03:43.470> I<00:03:43.530> want<00:03:43.770> to

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
snap to this guy as fast as I want to

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.070 
snap to this guy as fast as I want to
because<00:03:44.070> I<00:03:44.250> I<00:03:44.430> feel<00:03:44.940> like<00:03:45.150> I'm<00:03:45.330> not<00:03:45.480> restricted

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
because I I feel like I'm not restricted

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.600 
because I I feel like I'm not restricted

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
always don't have to now the reason why

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.390 
always don't have to now the reason why
I<00:03:58.020> asked<00:03:58.320> you<00:03:58.440> guys<00:03:58.590> to<00:03:58.680> do<00:03:58.860> this<00:03:58.980> because<00:03:59.160> it

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
I asked you guys to do this because it

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.860 
I asked you guys to do this because it
gives<00:03:59.459> other<00:03:59.760> people<00:04:00.180> confidence<00:04:00.540> to<00:04:00.780> at

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
gives other people confidence to at

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.360 
gives other people confidence to at
least<00:04:00.989> try<00:04:01.320> it<00:04:01.440> out<00:04:01.620> now<00:04:01.860> they<00:04:02.040> don't<00:04:02.190> always

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
least try it out now they don't always

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.070 
least try it out now they don't always
have<00:04:02.640> to<00:04:02.760> record<00:04:03.060> themselves<00:04:03.300> but<00:04:03.660> it<00:04:03.810> it

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
have to record themselves but it it

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.750 
have to record themselves but it it
gives<00:04:04.739> them<00:04:04.890> the<00:04:05.010> confidence<00:04:05.040> you<00:04:05.520> know<00:04:05.640> at

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
gives them the confidence you know at

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.550 
gives them the confidence you know at
least<00:04:05.820> try<00:04:06.300> out<00:04:06.450> this<00:04:06.660> technique<00:04:06.720> and<00:04:07.290> see<00:04:07.470> if

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
least try out this technique and see if

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.340 
least try out this technique and see if
it<00:04:07.680> works<00:04:07.860> for<00:04:08.040> them<00:04:08.160> but<00:04:09.060> overall<00:04:09.360> once<00:04:10.050> again

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
it works for them but overall once again

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.320 
it works for them but overall once again
i<00:04:10.380> would<00:04:10.530> like<00:04:10.739> to<00:04:10.860> heavily<00:04:11.760> emphasize<00:04:12.150> this

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
i would like to heavily emphasize this

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.479 
i would like to heavily emphasize this
this<00:04:12.540> is<00:04:12.630> going<00:04:12.780> to<00:04:12.840> be<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:13.170> hardest<00:04:13.489> lesson

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
this is going to be the hardest lesson

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.570 
this is going to be the hardest lesson
you'll<00:04:14.640> probably<00:04:14.940> ever<00:04:15.209> do<00:04:16.280> with<00:04:17.280> in<00:04:17.430> this
