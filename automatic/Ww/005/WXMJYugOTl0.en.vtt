like this but it you can peel off the
ice<00:01:52.790> so<00:01:53.180> maybe<00:01:54.880> and<00:01:55.880> then<00:01:56.270> you<00:01:56.450> see<00:01:56.720> wow<00:01:57.650> it's

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
ice so maybe and then you see wow it's

like<00:01:58.460> really<00:01:58.880> eco-friendly<00:01:59.750> I<00:01:59.780> guess<00:02:00.080> because

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
like really eco-friendly I guess because

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.110 
like really eco-friendly I guess because
there's<00:02:00.560> like<00:02:00.740> cereal<00:02:01.250> broccoli<00:02:01.790> cabbage

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
there's like cereal broccoli cabbage

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.360 
there's like cereal broccoli cabbage
strawberry<00:02:02.930> and<00:02:03.500> they're<00:02:03.650> in<00:02:03.799> little<00:02:04.100> packs

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
strawberry and they're in little packs

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.010 
strawberry and they're in little packs
so<00:02:04.549> I<00:02:04.640> guess<00:02:04.820> you<00:02:04.970> put<00:02:05.180> it<00:02:05.360> in<00:02:05.479> a<00:02:05.540> fridge<00:02:05.780> and

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
so I guess you put it in a fridge and

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.780 
so I guess you put it in a fridge and
just<00:02:06.229> put<00:02:06.680> it<00:02:06.770> on<00:02:06.860> your<00:02:07.010> face<00:02:07.190> every<00:02:07.520> now<00:02:07.640> and

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
just put it on your face every now and

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.590 
just put it on your face every now and
then<00:02:08.290> there's<00:02:09.290> even<00:02:09.410> more<00:02:09.679> on<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.040> back<00:02:10.220> um

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
then there's even more on the back um

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.199 
then there's even more on the back um
and<00:02:11.600> these<00:02:12.560> I<00:02:12.980> think<00:02:13.549> this<00:02:13.700> one's<00:02:13.910> for

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
and these I think this one's for

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.500 
and these I think this one's for
whitening<00:02:14.830> this<00:02:15.830> one's<00:02:16.040> for<00:02:16.250> whitening<00:02:16.510> and

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
whitening this one's for whitening and

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.470 
whitening this one's for whitening and
