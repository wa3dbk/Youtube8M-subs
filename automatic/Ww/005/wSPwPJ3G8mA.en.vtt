in<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.670> scope<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.270> data<00:00:40.100> population

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
in the scope of the data population

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.920 
in the scope of the data population
contains<00:00:41.550> all<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.120> items<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.780> interest

contains all of the items of interest

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.740 
contains all of the items of interest
whereas<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:43.950> sample<00:00:44.460> contains<00:00:44.910> only<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.329> portion

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750

of the items in the population we often
talk<00:00:49.500> about<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:50.010> population<00:00:50.190> being<00:00:50.820> the

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
talk about the population being the

talk about the population being the
whole<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.480> whatever<00:00:51.809> we<00:00:52.079> are<00:00:52.170> wanting<00:00:52.440> to

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
whole of whatever we are wanting to

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.430 
whole of whatever we are wanting to
study<00:00:52.829> whereas<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> sample<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.570> just<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.989> subset

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
study whereas a sample is just a subset

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.790 
study whereas a sample is just a subset
of<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.770> population<00:00:57.170> question<00:00:58.170> four<00:00:58.410> we<00:00:58.680> are

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
of the population question four we are

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.979 
of the population question four we are
looking<00:00:58.920> at<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.309> difference<00:00:59.640> between

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
looking at the difference between

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.500 
looking at the difference between
statistic<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.440> parameter<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:02.359> statistic<00:01:03.359> is

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
statistic and a parameter a statistic is

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.780 
statistic and a parameter a statistic is
a<00:01:03.539> summary<00:01:03.960> measure<00:01:04.260> describing<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.339> sample

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
a summary measure describing a sample

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.030 
a summary measure describing a sample
where<00:01:06.299> as<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.659> parameter<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.500> summary

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
where as a parameter is a summary

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.510 
where as a parameter is a summary
measure<00:01:08.340> describing<00:01:09.180> an<00:01:09.360> entire<00:01:09.780> population

again<00:01:11.520> this<00:01:11.729> distinction<00:01:12.180> is<00:01:12.450> very<00:01:12.720> important

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
again this distinction is very important

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.770 
again this distinction is very important
because<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:14.130> helps<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.729> remind<00:01:15.030> us<00:01:15.330> about<00:01:15.540> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
because it helps to remind us about the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.570 
because it helps to remind us about the
difference<00:01:16.170> between<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.830> sample<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.490> a

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
called a statistic and this is

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.080 
called a statistic and this is
representative<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.979> fact<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:23.820> when<00:01:24.060> we
