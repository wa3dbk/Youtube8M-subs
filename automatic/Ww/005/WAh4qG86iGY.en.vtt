00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
title and i thought i wanted to use one

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.590 
title and i thought i wanted to use one
of<00:03:40.470> those<00:03:40.620> cut<00:03:40.860> aparts<00:03:41.280> and<00:03:41.490> i<00:03:41.910> do<00:03:41.970> use<00:03:42.420> the

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
of those cut aparts and i do use the

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.720 
of those cut aparts and i do use the
cutter<00:03:42.810> parts<00:03:43.140> but<00:03:43.470> i<00:03:43.500> don't<00:03:43.890> actually<00:03:44.340> just

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
cutter parts but i don't actually just

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.730 
cutter parts but i don't actually just
use<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:45.120> in<00:03:45.270> its<00:03:45.450> full<00:03:45.540> size<00:03:45.960> which<00:03:46.320> is<00:03:46.350> that

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
use it in its full size which is that

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.410 
use it in its full size which is that
for<00:03:47.070> but<00:03:47.220> i<00:03:47.340> think<00:03:47.520> it's<00:03:47.670> like<00:03:47.760> a<00:03:47.850> four<00:03:48.240> by<00:03:48.390> four

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
for but i think it's like a four by four

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.550 
for but i think it's like a four by four
or<00:03:48.750> three<00:03:49.260> by<00:03:49.440> three<00:03:49.860> and<00:03:50.690> cut<00:03:51.690> apart<00:03:52.050> i'm

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560

of<00:04:31.020> toyed<00:04:31.230> with<00:04:31.260> the<00:04:31.530> idea<00:04:31.560> of<00:04:31.920> putting<00:04:32.340> these

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
of toyed with the idea of putting these

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.810 
of toyed with the idea of putting these
three<00:04:33.870> mats<00:04:34.200> or<00:04:34.560> these<00:04:34.770> three<00:04:35.070> photos<00:04:35.310> on<00:04:35.670> the

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
three mats or these three photos on the

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.910 
three mats or these three photos on the
right<00:04:36.030> side<00:04:36.330> that<00:04:36.960> I<00:04:37.020> still<00:04:37.350> kept<00:04:37.620> it<00:04:37.740> to<00:04:37.830> the

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920

right side that I still kept it to the
left<00:04:38.130> side<00:04:38.370> I<00:04:38.400> thought<00:04:38.760> thought<00:04:38.940> it<00:04:39.060> would<00:04:39.180> be

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
left side I thought thought it would be

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.700 
left side I thought thought it would be
too<00:04:39.480> much<00:04:39.510> to<00:04:39.690> put<00:04:39.960> it<00:04:40.080> on<00:04:40.170> the<00:04:40.260> right<00:04:40.440> side

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
too much to put it on the right side

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.500 
too much to put it on the right side
just<00:04:41.040> for<00:04:41.130> what<00:04:41.400> I<00:04:41.430> was<00:04:41.760> going<00:04:41.940> for<00:04:42.030> for<00:04:42.390> this
