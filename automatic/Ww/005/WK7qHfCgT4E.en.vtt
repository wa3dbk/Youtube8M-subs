00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.739
 Hi girls 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:20.630
 A lot of people asked me how I did it. 

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:22.400
 This little flap here is with the blanket. 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.270
 so I'll show you 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.160
 quickly 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.020
 the technique of gluing and sewing you already 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.169
 You know I 'll show you how I did this. 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.239
 part that is and I also showed how 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:34.250
 cut on the handle will get thinner then 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.010
 I let it grow thinner and 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.870
 build thicker the thicker I 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.400
 I took a piece of blanket that with four 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:46.340
 ranks 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:49.399
 10 centimeters and a half I used and there 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.100
 I will do so this part I will 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.420
 paste will be inside the assignment of the 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.100
 area and then I'll do that 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.200
 previous classes procedure who 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.790
 did not watch can watch Ithaca death 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.780
 right step by step like I do 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:06.380
 This one will stay on the side of the side. 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:11.649
 from here you will cut into the size of 12 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:15.350
 centimeters and a half , there you go 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:18.490
 will necklace points that I will paste that only 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.490
 be happy 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:25.399
 anyone who has doubt still watch another 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.009
 The lesson that I show you right is what 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:34.100
 I'll just show you how the show will be. 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:38.240
 see here and here 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.639
 then sew and here in the party 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.090
 But you're just going to do it. 

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:50.029
 so he throws a drop of glue 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:54.759
 I did not take eletric mazziotti to popcorn. 

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:54.759
 here and the other one here 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:03.280
 Now you will come back with sdk here only 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.020
 I spoke like this to one another and then 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.470
 here I'll pass glue whenever she 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.630
 touch the sandal points to pull over 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:16.720
 that I'll pass a hen she stays 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:18.959
 knowing not to squeeze me and now I go 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.620
 come again 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.620
 twist again 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.070
 pressing not take off after you go 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:34.920
 make stitches as already 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.920
 I also taught in other classes 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:43.239
 Look how beautiful people make braids. 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.970
 It is also pretty okay you can do 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.459
 the two flap handles or 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:52.420
 to do like I did here is only in the part of 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:03:00.040
 to be a differential and here in the 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:03:02.350
 At the end of the day, I'll also stick to the tip. 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.100
 but I'm going to sew this very well here 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:12.640
 to not return to host a tip 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:14.709
 I'm going to paste another glue is just to give 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.200
 an insured for sewing better because 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:20.440
 What will hold means will be the seam 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:24.040
 and you're going to do some dots like that on 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.450
 tip I learned well later you give a 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.090
 centimeter or so away 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.010
 make another dot cut the line the step 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.900
 here inside the blanket of the other 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.019
 contained mostly continuous Daltro 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.060
 the ends are always at the tips and 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:42.190
 middle here I'm going to give you a few dots 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:45.220
 by staying very secure right 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.860
 so it's that very easy people, do not you think? 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.780
 What a beautiful and easy thing, and there you go. 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.959
 like this 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.390
 chic good hope you have enjoyed one 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.859
 idea is easy and quick to do gives a 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.940
 differential in your work I have 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:04.019
 sure your customers will love it 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.019
 Kiss Kiss and bye, bye.
