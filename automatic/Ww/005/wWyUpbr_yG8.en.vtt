00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
have done with that machine and finally

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:51.950 
have done with that machine and finally
I<00:00:50.910> think<00:00:51.149> they've<00:00:51.270> gotten<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.539> MacBook<00:00:51.930> Air

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960

lineup to the place where they wanted to

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.450 
lineup to the place where they wanted to
have<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.600> originally<00:00:55.020> back<00:00:55.469> in<00:00:55.500> 2008<00:00:56.280> when

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
have it originally back in 2008 when

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.099 
have it originally back in 2008 when
they<00:00:56.579> launched<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.059> people<00:00:57.390> finally

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
they launched it people finally

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.860 
they launched it people finally
gravitating<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.210> people<00:01:00.210> finally<00:01:00.420> get

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
gravitating to it people finally get

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.959 
gravitating to it people finally get
what<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.710> ultra<00:01:01.980> portable<00:01:02.190> machine<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.730> all

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
what that ultra portable machine is all

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.240

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
biased towards one of the other I think

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.450 
biased towards one of the other I think
that<00:02:43.170> both<00:02:43.380> could<00:02:43.620> be<00:02:43.710> great<00:02:43.890> machines<00:02:44.250> I'm

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
that both could be great machines I'm

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.300 
that both could be great machines I'm
sure<00:02:44.640> if<00:02:44.820> I<00:02:44.910> use<00:02:45.150> this<00:02:45.420> Sony<00:02:46.290> Y<00:02:46.560> Series<00:02:47.040> for<00:02:47.220> an

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
sure if I use this Sony Y Series for an

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.460 
sure if I use this Sony Y Series for an
extended<00:02:47.730> period<00:02:47.760> of<00:02:48.030> time<00:02:48.090> I<00:02:48.270> appreciate<00:02:49.020> it

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
extended period of time I appreciate it

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.560

for<00:02:49.860> what<00:02:50.010> it<00:02:50.130> is<00:02:50.160> but<00:02:51.150> it's<00:02:51.300> kind<00:02:51.510> of

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
for what it is but it's kind of

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.290

well<00:03:12.240> I<00:03:12.300> think<00:03:12.360> that<00:03:13.220> consumer<00:03:14.220> is<00:03:14.400> kind<00:03:14.670> of

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
well I think that consumer is kind of

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.810 
well I think that consumer is kind of
rare<00:03:15.060> I<00:03:15.390> think<00:03:16.080> when<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.560> consumer<00:03:17.100> has<00:03:17.400> finally

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
rare I think when a consumer has finally

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.090 
rare I think when a consumer has finally
made<00:03:17.970> up<00:03:18.090> their<00:03:18.240> mind<00:03:18.420> to<00:03:18.600> go<00:03:18.750> Mac<00:03:19.100> they've

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
made up their mind to go Mac they've

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.770 
made up their mind to go Mac they've
actually<00:03:20.310> made<00:03:20.670> a<00:03:20.700> conscious<00:03:21.180> effort<00:03:21.360> to<00:03:21.630> go

mean<00:03:41.820> this<00:03:41.970> debate<00:03:42.330> is<00:03:42.570> years<00:03:43.140> old<00:03:43.440> now<00:03:43.620> at

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
mean this debate is years old now at

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.830 
mean this debate is years old now at
this<00:03:43.950> stage<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.760> fact<00:03:45.000> is<00:03:45.150> people<00:03:45.450> feel<00:03:45.690> that

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
this stage the fact is people feel that

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.699 
this stage the fact is people feel that
they're<00:03:45.990> getting<00:03:46.260> a<00:03:46.320> little<00:03:46.440> bit<00:03:46.590> more

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
they're getting a little bit more

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.800 
they're getting a little bit more
quality<00:03:47.160> with<00:03:47.280> a<00:03:47.310> Mac<00:03:47.520> so<00:03:47.790> they<00:03:48.360> feel<00:03:48.780> that

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
quality with a Mac so they feel that

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
migrating to Mac I think that's really

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.520

I<00:04:28.440> think<00:04:28.860> that's<00:04:29.010> just<00:04:29.130> simply<00:04:29.460> how<00:04:29.639> it<00:04:29.790> is

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
I think that's just simply how it is

I think that's just simply how it is
right<00:04:30.060> across<00:04:30.150> the<00:04:30.330> board<00:04:30.690> I<00:04:30.750> think<00:04:30.780> that's

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
right across the board I think that's

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.140 
right across the board I think that's
kind<00:04:31.320> of<00:04:31.350> the<00:04:31.470> nature<00:04:31.950> of<00:04:31.980> the<00:04:32.340> whole<00:04:32.550> success

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
kind of the nature of the whole success

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:34.640 
kind of the nature of the whole success

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.770 
of the Mac lineup over the last few

they're<00:04:37.410> not<00:04:37.590> necessarily<00:04:38.190> comparing<00:04:38.910> and

doing<00:04:51.780> but<00:04:52.620> I<00:04:52.650> think<00:04:52.919> that's<00:04:53.070> actually<00:04:53.400> a

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
doing but I think that's actually a

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.550 
doing but I think that's actually a
different<00:04:53.639> type<00:04:53.910> of<00:04:53.940> consumer<00:04:54.570> and<00:04:54.750> well

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
different type of consumer and well

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.890 
different type of consumer and well
that's<00:04:55.860> just<00:04:55.980> my<00:04:56.190> opinion<00:04:56.340> I<00:04:57.090> don't<00:04:57.360> think<00:04:57.600> one

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
that's just my opinion I don't think one

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.409 
that's just my opinion I don't think one
is<00:04:58.110> is<00:04:58.350> better<00:04:58.889> over<00:04:59.190> the<00:04:59.280> other<00:04:59.460> I<00:04:59.729> think<00:05:00.270> at

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
is is better over the other I think at

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:01.790 
is is better over the other I think at
the<00:05:00.570> end<00:05:00.600> of<00:05:00.810> the<00:05:00.900> day<00:05:01.020> is<00:05:01.080> I<00:05:01.200> always<00:05:01.350> say<00:05:01.620> guys

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
the end of the day is I always say guys
