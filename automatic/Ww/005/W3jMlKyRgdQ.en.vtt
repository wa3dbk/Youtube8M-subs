00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:07.140
 Hello everyone, so we have today's video

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:15.420
 for the kitchen that eat it in korea 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.760
 today we will prepare to head that 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.240
 called not to lose that is the sword real 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.779
 it moves and so panchan so 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:31.050

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:32.669
 and captivates vocalists 36 pieces here with us 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.540
 beef meat 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.239
 150 grams I 'm worth bought such meat 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.760
 which is useful in such pieces 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:45.239
 in principle, you can still use meat 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.059
 which is chopped into straw but so too 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:53.149
 can not come stuffing no other kind 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:56.280
 meat armor will go well here we are a glass of 250 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:01:03.149
 milliliters of soy sauce is pure here 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.719
 tap water 1 1 2 1 chicken back 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.460
 ginger 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:11.640
 1 clove of garlic that's basically all we 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.180
 I prepare these first product and what 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:19.130
 I will show you step by step how everything 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:22.590
 preparing onions you need to forest in this way 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.729
 first I see two halves and then 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.390
 that's just me 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:31.490
 we cut too want to pay attention 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:35.880
 what do you want know someone 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:38.610
 the navel remained cut off otherwise 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.630
 frying it just crumbles will not 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.990
 very naturally not very convenient 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.860
 him 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.860
 consume 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:56.970
 to get such a system 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:57.600
 preferably happens he stayed so 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.450
 here we are 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.759
 our eggs are boiled before you need them 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.689
 I read somewhere on the Internet 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:10.440
 that you can lose them a half two 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:14.400
 three hours will be by the way not very strong 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.769
 concentrations and supposedly testicles can then 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.200
 it will be very easy to clean and so did 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:22.680
 but I didn't really like this hell 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.680
 because for my taste eggs like 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.400
 have gotten amongst the crap so we will 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.380
 Just clean it though it will be a chore 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.459
 just in the usual way clean and 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.569
 eggs from the shell and so here are the eggs 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.600
 abducted 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:43.500
 straight from the wicked ones the light is no longer but 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:46.680
 I'm exactly 30 minutes right here we have these 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.769
 things and a little bit got her on you 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:54.060
 swing is okay this is not a problem 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:56.870
 not critical and so on my skillet 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:02.070
 little bit on whether thomas on corn 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:16.709
 Now Moscow is warming then we will set 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:18.829
 there is a little bit of a search 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.829
 on 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.010
 I recently wrote that the best color 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.640
 pieces of white will need you happen not 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.640
 precipitation 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.600
 these can 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.270
 because it hits 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.120
 turn on 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:36.470
 I put a lot of work and then 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:41.240
 there will be a magical hotel so that our well 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:46.670
 too salty and now pause and 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:53.240
 bunnies all this needs to be a matter to bring 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:57.350
 until boiling at all we wait until boils and 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:59.860
 need to talk about 10 minutes bye 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:02.630
 testicles will not become so 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:09.220
 brownish until it soaks your 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:11.500
 sun we collapsed 10 minutes 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.750
 for they are thin brownish 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:18.020
 fanciers 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:20.330
 I poured water because I have beets 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.940
 does not like to salty 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:25.550
 that is, it can not salty budget already 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:29.660
 neatly he can not salted too 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:32.630
 salty so i pour more water 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:36.770
 than you can put your eyes away 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:40.130
 less if you try testicles if they 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:41.570
 will be too salty for you then you can 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:45.260
 add more water and boil more 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:48.080
 little can elements and there will be everything 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:50.980
 ready to eat 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:53.450
 you need to put a tablespoon of sugar 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:57.570
 tell a little bit and knocked down 

00:06:53.450 --> 00:07:00.640
 literally a minute and that will be 

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:03.970
 so our fountain called ball 

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:07.180
 or arkatov is a good snack for those 

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:10.630
