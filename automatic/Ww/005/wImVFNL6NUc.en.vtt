 the Netherlands 1 many of you have 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.719
 voted for this nation a nation that 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.219
 I liked a lot is a nation 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.540
 really bad we made straw with 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.309
 four stars in technical gesture then 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.020
 I do not know if it comes from my game or 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.160
 if it is for everyone the same the 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.640
 guys do not hesitate to tell me in the 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.680
 comments 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.910
 because in futile and 5 stars but 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.680
 in season mode I saw it I 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.969
 found 4 stars so I was a little 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.350
 little disappointed but it still remains a 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.260
 nation really interesting countries 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.120
 down and we really feasted and in 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.039
 that game was dropped against an opponent 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.420
 who had taken dortmund actually have 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.840
 I wanted to try a lot with 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.670
 Netherlands 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.659
 these nations that makes you want to try 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.670
 technical gestures because there are 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.030
 really very very strong players one of 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.119
 Straw 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.220
 van persie robben sneijder what is 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.420
 very good a very nice team 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.150
 and that's why I have a lot 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.950
 attempted in fact I was limited in mode in 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.600
 evil things simple fashion on fall then 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.290
 that still the goal is going up in 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.240
 division 1 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.250
 and suddenly you go see the guys in 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.640
 this match we are going to harvest a lot of 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.009
 opportunities even though we have dominated 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.079
 it did not want to go back here 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.060
 will be one of the last opportunities 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.860
 the referee could have whistled penalty but 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.560
 in any case he will not whistle and 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.460
 blow we will not leave this match on a 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.770
 draw 0 0 a draw really 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.049
 sad but hey we will catch up when 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.520
 of the next match 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.020
 with this nation of the Netherlands we are going 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.420
 falling against an opponent who had 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.820
 taken arsenal and it's going very well 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.140
 for us from the beginning of the game with 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.700
 originally album too I had 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.930
 forgot to mention among the players who 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.450
 have four stars in technical gesture 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.250
 will score a goal a goal to zero 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.320
 original gives monstrous just like 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.950
 in fall is to note that he plays middle 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.450
 central 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.830
 I do not know if you had at the beginning of 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.200
 when I did the training with the 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.870
 Netherlands it is in central very 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.910
 very good placement for him I hesitate I 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.470
 will not hesitate to place it mc bath 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.220
 fall 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.220
 besides, it seems to me that I did 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.379
 teams where I had placed it mc is 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.060
 in this match the guys the opponent is going 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.849
 a little bit farted a lead there he goes 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.830
 get out his guardian for nothing and we 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.530
 will register a second goal that we 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.660
 assure badens ahead to victory the 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.010
 dude he was not there he was not so good 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.140
 that the opponent the before his turn 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.880
 defense and suddenly I really 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.790
 enjoyed looked here van persie in this 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.349
 cases the blow of the headscarf and the referee 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.640
 hissed my fault since player has 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:52.060
 mowed I left you the 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.829
 slowed down and suddenly we have the opportunity to 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.360
 put a third goal and I got 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:57.819
 really feasted with van persie 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.970
 I scored a lot of goals with him 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.530
 during this game session he's me 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.750
 seems like I scored more than five goals 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.709
 if I read no shelter and frankly I 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.630
 loved playing with 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.190
 he's just as good a onlooker as 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.209
 in futin for those who have not seen the 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.810
 I really recommend 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.430
 to go see her 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.590
 I really enjoyed myself and 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.380
 season is the same and there look we're going 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.690
 still cashed a goal a goal enough 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.819
 his gags we want to clear the ball we are 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.440
 countered by our own player and we 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.230
 cash the goal but it does not matter 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.609
 still wins three museums at this match 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.410
 it's really deserved in relation to the 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:31.450
 content we could have really no photo 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.389
 and we will follow up with a third 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.069
 match the guys a tough match 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:38.139
 you will see it will happen whatever 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.970
 enough pretty rare thing especially me 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:41.010
 about even if we're going anyway 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.329
 touched the pole 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.790
 a very frank opportunity we are going 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:47.799
 find schnyder here I tried to 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.389
 lorentzweiler unfortunately I have either 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:51.190
 I have not framed either I pulled too much 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:53.230
 the guardian is here to watch we go 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.079
 to commit a fault and we will benefit 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.340
 red one red justified when 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:00.549
 same series that the tackle was pretty 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.370
 dangerous and watch some time 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:04.900
 after i'm going to redo mistakes and guys 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.389
 I 'm going to have a second round so of 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.200
 two reds in a short time we play 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:10.480
 at 9 against 11 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.269
 so I'll admit it 's not going to stop you from 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.760
 dominate this match it did not bother me in 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.350
 having fewer players 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.010
 and simply changed to actually my 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.690
 training and I pulled out straw and wi 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.620
 final 2100 to bring in two 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.580
 central defenders 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.870
 story of not having a hole behind 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.210
 and to watch we're really going 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.800
 dominated we will have many opportunities 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.340
 will hit the post twice in 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.410
 this match 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.210
 here we will find robben completely 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.590
 shemale that does not fit then I have nothing 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.960
 understood my players really wanted 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.070
 not framed in this match and of course 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.020
 last seconds of the match 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.820
 we will take the bus totally not 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.610
 deserve our opponent and suddenly there 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.780
 I was a little disgusted anyway 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.250
 because we really dominated this match 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.840
 and ensures language I wanted to go 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.389
 all alone but the referee cut in full 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.310
 momentum and suddenly we cash our 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:58.380
 first our first setback in this 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:02.039
 series so that makes us a total neither he 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.810
 seems to me 15 victories for 5 draws and 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:05.820
 a defeat so it's a good record but 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.990
 this game was disappointing to lose but 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.800
 look at the lions is going really well 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.510
 catch up 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.760
 this match is really going to be monstrous in 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.280
 content term a van persie really 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.630
 excellent very very pleasant to play 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.880
 that this player has frankly it's a 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.470
 van persie a killer look that makes 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.260
 individual feats there I go the 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.880
 stagger for original man I'm going to 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.770
 unfortunately chew this action 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.940
 it's a pity it could have returned but 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.949
 good it's not the opportunities that are going 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.840
 miss in this match we will find van 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:33.090
 persie there I go a little bit benefited 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.039
 from the space to go straight on 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.289
 the little lob of the left it returns like 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:39.930
 in butter 2 goals to 0 in the mans a 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:41.580
 match a match that was already folded into 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.810
 is there the match from that moment 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.160
 there I said to myself, I'm going to do 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.490
 pleasure to subscribers I'm really going 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.139
 try some interesting stuff and there we 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:52.020
 will find robben on a pretty counter 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:54.900
 lucky and triple the bet 3 goals to 0 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:57.360
 really the mass was said even though my 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:00.570
 opponent will react on this action 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.760
 a goal it was his first opportunity and 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.409
 after he's going to have a second opportunity 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.270
 look here it's a little bit 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:09.750
 he'll get it 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:11.159
 very very lucky to give her 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.810
 the head for tv what was 

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:15.330
 completely alone and he will benefit 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.919
 a penalty at this point in the match 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.590
 frankly I was still serene 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:22.590
 even if the penalty is going to be scored there 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:24.690
 really had a lot of space and 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.580
 sure this umpteenth ball on van 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.110
 persie 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.419
 I will try the little treat 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.370
 of the game session the blow of the headscarf 

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:32.569
 of van persie who would pass an answer 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.819
 simple who can to the goal that I had put 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:36.710
 with ibra with the low in the mode 

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:38.599
 season with the psg it's pretty much the 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.759
 same goal is easy enough to score 

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:41.210
 like that especially when the gold goes dark 

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:42.830
 above 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.870
 generally he does not have the support for 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.490
 go back and then we will even 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.500
 recover on an error to my 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.520
 opponent we're going to dribble a little 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.659
 little unnecessarily there really was 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.520
 way to score before but it was 

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:54.080
 just to have fun and suddenly we go 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.270
 mark I think it's the third 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.039
 purpose of van persie seems to me in this 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.960
 match one really to van persie really 

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:01.580
 very effective that I advise you 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.409
 really to test in futin 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.270
 Frankly I loved this player 

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:06.919
 especially since he's really not 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:08.960
 expensive it is affordable it must be to 

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:12.080
 around ten thousand credit for a 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.520
 player at 88.2 of general it is neglected 

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.729
 not really guys clearly 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.830
 test one will get some 

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:21.949
 opportunities late in the game here we go 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:24.080
 find robben unfortunately for my 

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:26.150
 opponent he will make a mistake and the 

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.129
 coup we will register the sixth goal of this 

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:29.629
 match a game really completely crazy 

00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:31.250
 with nine goals in the program anyway 

00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:33.020
 guys I really hope this 

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:35.150
 episode pleased you do not hesitate to vote 

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:36.529

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.669
