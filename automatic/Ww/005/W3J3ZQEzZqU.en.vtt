00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.620
 jesus offices wonderful thing many people followed him 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.299
 the charity that lives the sick and spoke of God's will 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:12.849
 jesus was good 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.169
 he had not sinned Jesus always did what God wanted me to do 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:21.619
 jesus came to show himself in love with God for us and to bring back the 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.069
 people to follow god and walk follow his principles 

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:30.279
 at that time he gave up iris religions that were very jealous of Jesolo 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.239
 they didn't want to admit that they had disobeyed God's laws and that we 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.050
 sinners like all other people 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.160
 their hearts were hard and they didn't want to believe that Jesus had been sent by 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.850
 God 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.570
 they said Jesus' lies had him arrested 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.310
 Jesus was beaten 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.850
 the soldiers placed a crown of thorns on his upside down rice 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.180
 Jesus could have faced all this and stop me 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.030
 but he didn't notice 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.340
 Jesus came into the world to become a sacrifice for sin 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.600
 the usual would have been sacrificed for the sins of all people 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.960
 Jesus was taking on the punishment that people should have had 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.829
 the soldiers nailed jesus on the wooden cross 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:29.359
 then they raised the cross on the ground and Jesus remains weight until he died 

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:33.069
 in those days it doubled to kill the worst criminal in that way 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.040
 two criminals were similarly crucified that day but jesus 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.180
 he was not a criminal he was innocent 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.260
 Jesus had done nothing wrong 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.820
 that day he was dying for the sins of other people and not his own 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.899
 he was dying for the sins of the people who were alive at that time but 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.770
 also for the sins of the people and of the generations to come 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.780
 his death takes away the sins of all those who want to change theirs 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.590
 sinful way of life and accepting his sacrifice as their own 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.820
 sacrifice 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.140
 when Jesus died, you offer a perfect Jesus sacrifice paid for sins 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.739
 of all people shedding his blood without sin 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.369
 god said that any other sacrifice is no longer necessary 

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:23.739
 because jesus summer is perfect 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.739
 Oh well 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:31.919
 mike of jesus 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:33.800
 they thought they had it 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.159
 but it was not so 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:39.069
 after jesus died on the cross a rich friend fourth the body of jesus 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.309
 in his grave carved in the rock 

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:44.539
 and they closed the entrance of the trumpet with a large stone 

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:49.179
 on the third day early morning some women went to the grave to complete 

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:51.649
 the burial according to their customs 

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:56.329
 they were surprised to see the rock rolled away and that Jesus was not the most 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:57.209
 there 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:02.399
 they were even more surprised to see two angels cry they said alive 

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:06.749
 the messengers of saying told them very clearly editor risen from the dead 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.390
 after Jesus was resurrected from the dead he visited some of his disciples 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.160
 warrock the weather with them 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.079
 tommaso one of his ix20 disciples looks forward to it, I couldn't believe it 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:28.249
 he said it 

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:31.770
 until I see his pierced hands I admit I was 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.149
 I didn't believe 

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:37.129
 jesus return again among the disciples and this time tommaselli 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:41.599
 jesus speaks directly to camastra fitomagra it works in front of him 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:42.869
 believer 

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:44.049
 Jesus said 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.850
 you believe because the minister 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.850
 but blessed are those who do not invite me to believe 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:02.189
 for 40 days after his resurrection of the death of Jesus the people appeared 

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:05.829
 many saw him knowing that Jesus was alive 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.939
 now for jesus the time to return to heaven 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:12.129
 isu had finished the job he had come to do 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:16.459
 Jesus told his followers that we had to go and tell everyone what he was 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:17.599
 He had done 

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:22.449
 fifth while all those who were streets were looking at jesus was kidnapped into the sky 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:27.180
 as long as it is I have it in the clouds and disappeared from their sight in that 

00:04:27.179 --> 00:04:31.330
 moment two angels appeared told him to the disciples of jesus 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.930
 at some time he will return in the same way that he left 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:36.870
 Jesus had a fire 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.680
 is preparing a place for all those who believed and follow it 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.680
 Jesus has prepared for us to go away to go to God 

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:54.789
 because jesus died on the cross 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:58.659
 Wilson died to save sinners from the punishment of sin 

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:03.050
 Jesus never committed the sin Jesus died to take away sin 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.639
 that separated us from god 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:10.240
 the cross reminds us that Jesus the perfect lamb of god the holy the pure 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.930
 it is without sin 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.400
 Jesus has been sacrificed for us when we believe in Jesus we repent 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.999
 from our sin 

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:20.249
 God forgives our sins 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:23.860
 jesus allowed us to become the children of god his friends 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:37.370
 when Jesus was on earth he told many stories to help 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.129
 people to understand the ways of God taught him that there are two ways 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:46.239
 each of us begins to go on the wide road enough of the sin that 

00:05:46.239 --> 00:05:48.830
 leads to destruction is punishment 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.339
 we all have in the reader of sin 

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:56.499
 that we inherited from Adam the first man we have sinned by doing things 

00:05:56.499 --> 00:05:57.870
 sorry shipping 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.940
 Jesus said that we must leave the wide road and enter the street 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.919
 narrow that it brings and I in heaven 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:08.059
 we can enter the narrow street only through jesus 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:13.849
 we cannot enter only indecisive pints into our sins and accepting sacrifice 

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:17.300
 that Jesus did on the cross for our sins 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.039
 why don't you directly talk Jesus from your heart 

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:27.309

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:31.479

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:40.319
