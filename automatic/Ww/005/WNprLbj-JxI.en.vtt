these<00:00:08.639> past<00:00:08.910> few<00:00:09.000> weeks<00:00:09.120> I've<00:00:09.480> been<00:00:09.510> trying

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
these past few weeks I've been trying

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.480 
these past few weeks I've been trying
out<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:10.019> little<00:00:10.260> experiment<00:00:10.769> I<00:00:10.920> really<00:00:11.309> wanted

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
out a little experiment I really wanted

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.950 
out a little experiment I really wanted
to<00:00:11.550> know<00:00:11.700> which<00:00:11.880> animal<00:00:12.330> was<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.450> most<00:00:12.719> played

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
to know which animal was the most played

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.959 
to know which animal was the most played
animal<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.410> animal<00:00:13.500> gym<00:00:13.830> so<00:00:14.250> I<00:00:14.280> decided<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:14.880> go

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
animal and animal gym so I decided to go

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.340 
animal and animal gym so I decided to go
ahead<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.269> figure<00:00:15.540> it<00:00:15.570> out<00:00:15.660> myself<00:00:15.870> because

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
ahead and figure it out myself because

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.540 
ahead and figure it out myself because
it<00:00:16.440> didn't<00:00:16.650> seem<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:16.859> be<00:00:16.949> anything<00:00:17.130> online

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
it didn't seem to be anything online

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.490 
it didn't seem to be anything online
what<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.119> would<00:00:18.390> do<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:19.080> would<00:00:19.140> switch

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
what I would do is I would switch

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.960 
what I would do is I would switch
servers<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.070> go<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.220> your<00:00:20.400> Mon<00:00:20.520> Township

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.959 
list that I made in my notes what I felt
like<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.650> gather<00:00:31.859> enough<00:00:32.130> information<00:00:32.430> I<00:00:32.820> put

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
like I gather enough information I put

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.910 
like I gather enough information I put
all<00:00:33.090> my<00:00:33.120> data<00:00:33.420> into<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.719> word<00:00:34.020> counter<00:00:34.469> site<00:00:34.710> and

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
all my data into a word counter site and

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:44.209 
all my data into a word counter site and
yeah<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.760> ended<00:00:36.210> up<00:00:36.300> with<00:00:36.860> 666<00:00:37.860> words<00:00:43.219> after

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
yeah I ended up with 666 words after

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.950 
yeah I ended up with 666 words after
that<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.760> took<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.090> list<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.420> put<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.660> into<00:00:45.899> a

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
that I took the list and put it into a

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.660 
that I took the list and put it into a
word<00:00:46.110> frequency<00:00:46.710> site<00:00:46.920> where<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.160> took<00:00:47.280> that

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
word frequency site where I took that

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.850 
word frequency site where I took that
data<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.239> put<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.660> into<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:49.170> spreadsheet<00:00:49.440> and

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
data and put it into a spreadsheet and

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.590 
data and put it into a spreadsheet and
then<00:00:50.190> made<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.430> graph<00:00:50.730> out<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.510> I'm

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
then made a graph out of that and I'm

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.670 
then made a graph out of that and I'm
gonna<00:00:51.719> show<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:52.050> right<00:00:52.199> now<00:00:52.260> because<00:00:52.379> I

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
gonna show you that right now because I

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.510 
gonna show you that right now because I
know<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.890> guys<00:00:53.039> probably<00:00:53.070> getting<00:00:53.489> bored

and<00:00:59.540> just<00:01:00.140> like<00:01:00.290> I<00:01:00.410> suspected<00:01:00.950> articles<00:01:01.550> for

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
and just like I suspected articles for

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
like Alden and there was one where it

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.940 
like Alden and there was one where it
was<00:01:34.160> a<00:01:34.190> little<00:01:34.420> 78%<00:01:35.420> Arctic<00:01:36.050> Wolf's<00:01:36.320> I<00:01:36.410> counted

was a little 78% Arctic Wolf's I counted

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.460 
was a little 78% Arctic Wolf's I counted
it's<00:01:37.550> just<00:01:37.850> everyone<00:01:38.630> looks<00:01:38.840> the<00:01:38.930> same<00:01:39.170> and

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
for a game that I would say is summed up

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.400 
for a game that I would say is summed up
by<00:01:41.420> three<00:01:41.660> things<00:01:42.040> friendships<00:01:43.040> trading<00:01:43.790> and
