00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.520 
particles and what I do with this is I
would<00:01:43.880> actually<00:01:44.210> throw<00:01:44.480> it<00:01:44.690> back<00:01:44.930> into<00:01:45.380> my

nice fine material very consistent in

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.330 
nice fine material very consistent in
the<00:01:59.090> particle<00:01:59.540> size<00:01:59.750> that<00:02:00.440> would<00:02:00.650> work<00:02:01.100> really

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
the particle size that would work really

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.850 
the particle size that would work really
nicely<00:02:01.670> in<00:02:02.060> your<00:02:02.270> gardens<00:02:02.720> as<00:02:03.409> a<00:02:03.470> soil

and your what you're going to start

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.910 
and your what you're going to start

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
volume material and by the end it's

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:13.930 
volume material and by the end it's
going<00:02:12.140> to<00:02:12.230> reduce<00:02:12.650> in<00:02:12.860> volume<00:02:13.010> by<00:02:13.250> about<00:02:13.280> 50%

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
going to reduce in volume by about 50%

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.750 
going to reduce in volume by about 50%
so<00:02:14.870> you're<00:02:15.560> not<00:02:15.709> going<00:02:15.920> to<00:02:15.980> get<00:02:16.130> a<00:02:16.160> lot<00:02:16.730> of
