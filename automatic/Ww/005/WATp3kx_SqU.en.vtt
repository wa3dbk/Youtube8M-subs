to work at all those and thought I

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.359 
to work at all those and thought I
needed<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.530> what<00:01:52.770> I've<00:01:52.860> learned<00:01:53.159> over

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
needed to and what I've learned over

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.670 
needed to and what I've learned over
time<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.790> actually<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.659> pull<00:01:54.840> back<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.439> that

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
time is actually to pull back and that

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.899 
time is actually to pull back and that
you<00:01:55.770> really<00:01:55.799> need<00:01:56.219> them<00:01:56.369> for<00:01:56.520> very<00:01:56.759> specific

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
you really need them for very specific

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.209 
you really need them for very specific
things<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.810> I've<00:01:58.409> kind<00:01:58.649> of<00:01:58.710> pulled<00:01:58.890> back<00:01:59.040> and

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
things and I've kind of pulled back and

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.469 
things and I've kind of pulled back and
learn<00:01:59.280> how<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.520> do<00:01:59.610> them<00:01:59.759> on<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.969> cheap<00:02:00.149> that

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
learn how to do them on the cheap that

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.330 
learn how to do them on the cheap that
makes<00:02:00.689> sense<00:02:00.840> because<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.530> lot<00:02:01.799> of<00:02:01.829> times<00:02:02.070> not

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
makes sense because a lot of times not

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.649 
makes sense because a lot of times not
only<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.579> more<00:02:02.759> economical<00:02:02.790> but<00:02:03.450> it's<00:02:03.570> also

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
only is it more economical but it's also

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.149 
only is it more economical but it's also
more<00:02:03.899> exciting<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.469> more<00:02:04.640> dynamic

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
more exciting and more dynamic

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.729 
more exciting and more dynamic
and<00:02:06.670> the<00:02:07.570> other<00:02:07.780> one<00:02:07.990> which<00:02:08.170> is<00:02:08.200> a<00:02:08.349> real<00:02:08.500> biggie
