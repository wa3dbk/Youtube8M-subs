00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 before starting with the video them 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.480
 I wanted to say that I'm already back such 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.730
 Once there are still few people who see my 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.800
 videos but that's going to change then 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.840
 I will try to upload a new video all 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.759
 the days and if it had not gone up this 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.190
 second part was because my pc did not 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.380
 it worked and I'm already back here with 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.750
 a new intro because the original lasted 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.029
 a lot I will be uploading a lot 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.430
 of videos one of them the predictions 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.680
 for the next pp v battleground and without 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.570
 more than saying let's start with the second 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.650
 part of possible struggles for hours 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.650
 lehman ya 32 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.690
 two 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.470
 another one of the possible combats for webs 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.900
 from lehman and 32 would be a match between 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.150
 stefan and mcmann and the ufc champion 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.520
 Russian round and these 2 already had a 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.590
 meeting in the last edition of the ues 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.050
 lehman and what would this fight do 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.270
 it was more likely in addition if you add it 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.450
 the intentions of round in being a 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.190
 time more in the ww and we also have 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.960
 the company's goal in terms of 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.509
 assistants for the great event of the 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.520
 next year would be very favorable to perform 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.890
 this encounter and if it did not happen 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.140
 we could see a match of couples 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.420
 mixed between the rock and Russian round and ante 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.490
 triple h and his wife stephanie but such 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.619
 once we could only see them as 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.899
 companions in the combat of the rock and 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.880
 triple h now with everything said the 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.700
 probability of the fight between these two 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.009
 it can be between 40 and 70 percent 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.840
 because good the reason for this percentage 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.700
 is that you could take a good 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.399
 outcome to what we saw this year in 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.440
 ures lehman and 31 also this fight 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.990
 could be the debut of the champion of the 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.179
 ufc in the company of the glen this is 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.860
 somewhat uncertain at the moment but if 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:56.690
 he has a good rivalry maybe 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.060
 let's have this combat the proxy 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.710
 now without more to say of these two 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:05.229
 let's move on to the next fight 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.600
 of rock versus brock lesnar could be 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.429
 the answer in case triple h does not 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.709
 face the rock and in case you 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.959
 stone cold can not fight because it is not 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.700
 very good health thanks to the series of 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.040
 injuries he has suffered in his career 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.930
 this would be the best answer in case 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.730
 that the rivals of both were not 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.319
 ready for the event this pair of 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.360
 beasts can carry out a 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.370
 great clear combat if the 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.260
 producers carry out a good fief 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.569
 between them it would have to be fine 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.790
 argued their rivalry this possible 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.860
 combat does not have good arguments but 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.900
 it could be a great alternative in case 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.120
 that their respective rivals are not 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.370
 ready all the above makes your 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.489
 combat have a probability around 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.440
 from 30 to 60% since this combat 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.200
 it is only an alternative to the possible 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.180
 combats of this pair of fighters 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.130
 although another answer in case austin 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.900
 is not fit to fight and they do not 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.120
 agree with the directors of 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.250
 the company we would see a struggle between the 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.800
 beast incarnate brock lesnar and the game 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.200
 triple h something like what we saw years 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.329
 back if you wonder why I put this 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.250
 information here is because there is not much 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.950
 to say of the possible struggle between 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.220
 and triple h now we will move on to the next 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.220
 combat 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.550
 another one of the possible combats for webs 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.400
 from lehman ya 32 is the fight between the 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.380
 undertaker before kevin owens that's how 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.450
 look like the undertaker's combat and 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.880
 sting does not convince Vince much 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.800
 mcmahon and then at the end he always takes 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.630
 the last word of what happens in the 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.400
 company and at the time of lowering the 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.800
 probability of the fight between steel 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.930
 undertaker, many rumors of the 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.330
 possible challenger to the dead man and the 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.490
 what else is sounding is kevin owens but 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.050
 so that this combat becomes a reality 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.390
 owens must continue with the push that has 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.310
 been getting so for someone 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.530
 can face the gravedigger should 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.480
 be very, very good at such sport 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.760
 once we do not have the opportunity to see 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.470
 our dreamed combat but if there will be the 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.480
 opportunity for someone good to be 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.530
 in front of the undertaker I have nothing left 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.420
 more than saying 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.730
 so we'll move on to the probability of 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.890
 combat which is between 60 and 80 per 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.989
 a hundred because the rumors of the 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.420
 combat between the undertaker and sting 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.610
 besides ko is getting a good push 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.350
 what would help him to carry out his combat 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.900
 before the dead man until here the 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.880
 possible struggles for west lehman ya 32 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.680
 now I will tell you some possible 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.020
 fighters who will have a role 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.730
 important in the event to perform the 3 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.130
 April next year 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.960
 no doubt the word is lehman already 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.090
 next year will have great 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.570
 talents and for this event to be 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.370
 best 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.980
 will have fighters who are or 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.930
 they just left nx t without any doubt 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.730
 those that have the greatest possibility of 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.030
 appear in the great event will be 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:47.370
 sunshine ideo and tam and adriÃ¡n neville without 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.050
 value and kevin owens while several of 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.360
 these already debuted on the roster 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.640
 main still have essence of the enee 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.380
 xt and there is no doubt that the producers 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.810
 will put any of them in the 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.580
 event and maybe not just some 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.950
 it may be that all five are the 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:05.270
 lucky we just need to wait 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.270
 to see what happens 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.400
 but not only the fighters of the lx te 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.140
 will appear in him also the divas of the 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.060
 yellow and black mark have the 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.310
 possibility of appearing in the event of 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.710
 most popular wrestling world say 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.690
 as you know that charlotte of killing and 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.400
 bailey have a great future in the 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.590
 company any of them can 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.450
 appear in the event although three of 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.370
 they already debuted in raw for 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:30.350
 confront the sisters candles and 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.720
 alicia fox all have the possibility 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.790
 to appear in the event either as 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.070
 challenger to someone or manager of another 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:39.050
 superstar or diva here ends the 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:42.320
 second and last part of the possible 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:44.330
 fights for west lehman and 32 eye I'll 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.910
 I mentioned the possible struggles for west 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.800
 lehman and 32 so they can 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.750
 occur or not because each one has its 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.670
 possibility and not because there is not 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.910
 mentioned great superstars or 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:58.610
 divas like randy orton sÃ©amus john dinner 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.920
 rousseff cÃ©sar or page nick and candle shines 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.110
 candle etcetera means that they are not going to 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.450
 be present until here finished the
