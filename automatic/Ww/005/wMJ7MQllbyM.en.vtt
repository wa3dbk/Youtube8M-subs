00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.330 

this<00:04:30.870> is<00:04:31.020> the<00:04:31.140> natural<00:04:31.290> part<00:04:31.650> so<00:04:31.830> I<00:04:31.860> haven't

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
this is the natural part so I haven't

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.100

was<00:04:34.200> going<00:04:34.350> to<00:04:34.410> review<00:04:34.740> it<00:04:34.920> um<00:04:36.320> so<00:04:37.320> this<00:04:37.470> is<00:04:37.650> not

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
was going to review it um so this is not

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.430 
was going to review it um so this is not
optimally<00:04:38.580> what<00:04:38.850> about<00:04:39.030> look<00:04:39.120> like<00:04:39.440> but

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
optimally what about look like but

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.960 
optimally what about look like but
that's<00:04:40.830> the<00:04:41.010> hairline<00:04:41.600> positives<00:04:42.600> um<00:04:43.520> it<00:04:44.520> does

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
that's the hairline positives um it does

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.970 
that's the hairline positives um it does
not<00:04:45.150> tango<00:04:45.570> very<00:04:45.780> much<00:04:46.050> I<00:04:46.380> haven't<00:04:46.710> had<00:04:46.830> very

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
not tango very much I haven't had very

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.720 
not tango very much I haven't had very
much<00:04:47.190> shedding<00:04:47.670> at<00:04:47.940> all<00:04:48.390> actually<00:04:48.810> um<00:04:49.440> it<00:04:50.280> is<00:04:50.670> a

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
much shedding at all actually um it is a

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.200 
much shedding at all actually um it is a
very<00:04:51.020> realistic<00:04:52.020> density<00:04:52.830> and<00:04:53.210> realistic

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
very realistic density and realistic

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.380 
very realistic density and realistic
texture<00:04:54.750> and<00:04:55.230> it<00:04:55.980> does<00:04:56.190> have<00:04:56.220> a<00:04:56.700> convenient

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
texture and it does have a convenient

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.660 
texture and it does have a convenient
Cal<00:04:57.600> construction<00:04:58.140> for<00:04:58.320> someone<00:04:58.620> like<00:04:58.740> me<00:04:59.010> who

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
Cal construction for someone like me who

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.250 
Cal construction for someone like me who
doesn't<00:04:59.700> really<00:05:00.150> like<00:05:00.450> full<00:05:00.720> lace<00:05:00.930> wigs

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
doesn't really like full lace wigs

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.550 
doesn't really like full lace wigs
because<00:05:02.040> i<00:05:02.250> don't<00:05:02.430> use<00:05:03.330> any<00:05:03.360> adhesive<00:05:03.810> or<00:05:04.290> blue

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
because i don't use any adhesive or blue

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.660 
because i don't use any adhesive or blue
um<00:05:04.940> to<00:05:05.940> put<00:05:06.120> my<00:05:06.270> units<00:05:06.570> on<00:05:06.690> negatives<00:05:07.350> I<00:05:07.680> do

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:08.670 
um to put my units on negatives I do

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.420 
um to put my units on negatives I do
think<00:05:09.000> it's<00:05:09.120> a<00:05:09.180> bit<00:05:09.360> pricey<00:05:09.570> for<00:05:10.140> this<00:05:10.920> unit<00:05:11.250> I

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
think it's a bit pricey for this unit I

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.390 
think it's a bit pricey for this unit I
think<00:05:11.820> I<00:05:12.780> think<00:05:13.320> this<00:05:13.500> unit<00:05:13.830> for<00:05:13.860> this<00:05:14.190> length

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
think I think this unit for this length

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.100 
think I think this unit for this length
it<00:05:14.610> is<00:05:14.700> around<00:05:15.000> three<00:05:15.300> hundred<00:05:15.360> and<00:05:15.660> seventy

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
it is around three hundred and seventy

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.830 
it is around three hundred and seventy
dollars<00:05:16.530> I<00:05:16.830> don't<00:05:17.610> really<00:05:17.730> see<00:05:17.880> the<00:05:18.150> value<00:05:18.180> and

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
dollars I don't really see the value and

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.380 
dollars I don't really see the value and
not<00:05:19.020> one<00:05:19.530> of<00:05:19.650> the<00:05:19.860> lace<00:05:20.310> front<00:05:20.610> wig<00:05:20.850> I<00:05:20.970> kind<00:05:21.330> of

not one of the lace front wig I kind of

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.320 
not one of the lace front wig I kind of
see<00:05:21.600> that<00:05:21.920> price<00:05:22.920> it<00:05:23.250> was<00:05:23.700> like<00:05:23.880> a<00:05:23.970> full<00:05:24.150> this

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
see that price it was like a full this

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.110

I think might be a little bit too
believable<00:05:42.270> and<00:05:42.990> the<00:05:43.140> fact<00:05:43.320> that<00:05:43.380> you<00:05:43.530> can<00:05:43.770> say
