00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.890
 on July 1, 1887 latorre began to take height 

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:16.679
 the steam cranes iván hoisting and placing the huge pieces of the 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:19.550
 metallic structure 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.539
 two-thirds of the oaks had to fit the workshops to be able 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.509
 assemble the pieces directly on site 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:30.859
 nao one of the current techniques to accelerate the work makes me feel 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.859
 that it is necessary to explain why 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.440
 will be doing managing foreign companies 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.520
 the dynamism of the works paid off 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.740
 facing the decades that had taken to build the huge 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.240
 monuments of antiquity or the almost two centuries of notre dame 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:57.130
 the eiffel tower was completed in just 22 months and with only 300 workers 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.130
 the steel industry 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.890
 when the last piece was placed in 1889 the masterpiece of justa citel 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.090
 It surpassed the Great Pyramid of Giza 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.010
 and it became the tallest structure in the world 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:19.360
 not a record that he kept until 1930 when the crysler building was built 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.360
 from New York 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.910
 Well, in general, the Eiffel Tower is that during the first years 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.350
 will formalize whether the French like it or not 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.759
 this was a reflection of the country's technological identity and artists of its 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.979
 flow that architectural something that the southernmost elites did not like 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.450
 Somali from her boyfriend 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.180
 the night of today everyone seems pretty pretty 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.610
 the 11 June 21, 1889 in the eiffel tower opened its doors to the world 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.000
 surveys and that he personally directed the visits of many 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.240
 personalities and aristocrats like buffalo bills the sha of persia the teide 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.710
 seam 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.030
 the prince of wales and even thomas edison lobao the tower became 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.300
 the success of the exhibition attracted almost two million people and even 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.480
 gave name to a female dress model just makes happy that there was 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.630
 financed almost 80% of the project in exchange for the benefits of all 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.260
 Confessions did not take more than a year to recover his latorre investment 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
 would end up making him a very rich man 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.849
 from that afternoon he did use units republican society was to congratulate 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.349
 to do and many very small 'pieces' that were tuned in supported each other 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.349
 the others in some way represents an analogy of the republican society 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.159
 in which everyone 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.400
 all social classes support each other in a democratic government 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.400
 we support the aulaqi taking forward 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:55.659
 Spain despite the planes that are the taxi drivers of the country I love this 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:57.280
 city ​​and I love france 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.470
 he went after all the taxi drivers are grumpy everywhere if he could 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.870
 back to the past some of the things I would do would be to pass an end to 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.340
 week in versailles with Luis 14 you are going to have a coffee with one of my idols 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.399
 Victor Hugo before starting the session or justice is advanced 

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:14.760
 but since I can not 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.590
 I'm happy to have my coffee admiring the rosette of notre dame las 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.720
 stained glass windows of the cathedral disaster or division of the eiffel tower and 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.819
 wondering how they managed that even at the highest points of 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:25.370
 Pressure 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.989
 Mexico will be able to support one kilo per square centimeter and the elegance 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.930
 and the style and sophistication of the French have survived the Roman mint 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.799
 of the 21st century 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.569
 as vain 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.729
 there are some who say that it is arrogance to be achieved I think it is in trusts 

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:44.659
 virtuous 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:46.969
 that's why from the city of lights piter good
