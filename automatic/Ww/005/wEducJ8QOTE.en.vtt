00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.789 

and<00:00:06.000> that's<00:00:06.270> when<00:00:06.509> I<00:00:06.540> decided<00:00:06.899> that<00:00:07.259> a<00:00:07.290> nyquil

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
and that's when I decided that a nyquil

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.280 
and that's when I decided that a nyquil
suppository<00:00:08.550> was<00:00:08.940> not<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.719> good<00:00:10.410> idea<00:00:11.030> and

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:12.290 
suppository was not a good idea and

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.839 
suppository was not a good idea and
that's<00:00:13.290> when<00:00:13.559> I<00:00:13.590> decided<00:00:13.980> that<00:00:14.160> performing<00:00:14.730> my

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
that's when I decided that performing my

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.120 
that's when I decided that performing my
own<00:00:15.000> dental<00:00:15.480> surgery<00:00:15.870> was<00:00:16.230> not<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.560> good<00:00:16.949> idea

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
own dental surgery was not a good idea

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.560 
own dental surgery was not a good idea
and<00:00:18.980> that's<00:00:19.980> when<00:00:20.340> I<00:00:20.430> decided<00:00:20.850> that<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.270> cheese

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
and that's when I decided that a cheese

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.900 
and that's when I decided that a cheese
grater<00:00:21.600> haircut<00:00:22.350> was<00:00:22.619> not<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:23.160> good<00:00:23.400> idea

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.180 

and<00:00:27.090> that's<00:00:27.750> when<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.020> decided<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:28.800> if<00:00:28.920> cheese

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:29.190 
and that's when I decided that if cheese

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.280 
and that's when I decided that if cheese
grater<00:00:29.550> suppository<00:00:30.420> was<00:00:30.660> probably<00:00:31.080> the

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:31.290 
grater suppository was probably the

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:38.030 
grater suppository was probably the
worst<00:00:31.550> idea<00:00:32.550> ever

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.000

in you know I've been thinking about

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.230 
in you know I've been thinking about
this<00:00:43.350> for<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.590> long<00:00:43.620> time<00:00:43.770> now<00:00:44.040> ever<00:00:44.850> since<00:00:45.060> I

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:45.240 
this for a long time now ever since I

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.450 
this for a long time now ever since I
was<00:00:45.390> 19<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.990> a<00:00:46.080> seven-foot-tall<00:00:46.500> Jedi<00:00:47.100> named

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.610 
was 19 and a seven-foot-tall Jedi named
Dan<00:00:47.700> Gelston<00:00:48.000> told<00:00:48.450> me<00:00:48.570> have<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.720> wonderous<00:00:49.410> bus

Dan Gelston told me have a wonderous bus

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.110 
Dan Gelston told me have a wonderous bus
pass<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.130> would<00:00:50.250> take<00:00:50.400> me<00:00:50.520> anywhere<00:00:51.060> I

wanted to go it's called the Greyhound

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
I can travel anywhere I want to go for

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.140 
I can travel anywhere I want to go for
two<00:00:58.140> months<00:00:58.440> across<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.830> content<00:00:59.280> except<00:01:00.060> for

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.150 
two months across the content except for

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.890 
two months across the content except for
Alaska<00:01:01.110> and<00:01:01.260> Newfoundland<00:01:02.130> I<00:01:02.840> don't<00:01:03.840> know

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
Alaska and Newfoundland I don't know

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.840 
Alaska and Newfoundland I don't know
about<00:01:04.050> Alaska<00:01:04.710> but<00:01:05.280> my<00:01:05.400> guess<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.670> that

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
about Alaska but my guess is that

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.460 
about Alaska but my guess is that
Newfoundlanders<00:01:06.570> are<00:01:06.690> just<00:01:06.900> too<00:01:07.080> hardcore

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
Newfoundlanders are just too hardcore

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.230 
Newfoundlanders are just too hardcore
and<00:01:07.860> cool<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.280> that's<00:01:08.430> why<00:01:08.580> Greyhound<00:01:09.000> wants

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
and cool and that's why Greyhound wants

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.510 
and cool and that's why Greyhound wants
us<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.479> pay<00:01:09.630> more<00:01:09.870> to<00:01:09.990> see<00:01:10.200> them<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:11.190> and

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
us to pay more to see them that and

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.040 
us to pay more to see them that and
their<00:01:11.790> buses<00:01:12.090> probably<00:01:12.420> don't<00:01:12.570> float<00:01:12.840> too

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
their buses probably don't float too

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.460 
their buses probably don't float too
well<00:01:14.090> so<00:01:15.090> I'm<00:01:15.180> leaving<00:01:15.540> tomorrow<00:01:15.720> with<00:01:16.440> a
