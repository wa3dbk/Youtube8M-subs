00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.119 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
show<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.160> how<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:39.300> lift<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:40.079> dark<00:00:40.620> roots

show you how to lift the dark roots

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.400 
show you how to lift the dark roots
which<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.820> previously<00:00:42.329> had<00:00:42.570> they<00:00:42.960> matched<00:00:43.230> my

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
which I previously had they matched my

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.260 
which I previously had they matched my
eyebrows<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:44.070> would<00:00:44.309> suggest<00:00:44.520> if<00:00:44.910> you've<00:00:45.059> got

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
eyebrows I would suggest if you've got

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.299 
eyebrows I would suggest if you've got
like<00:00:45.480> light<00:00:45.690> brown<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.230> medium<00:00:46.770> brown<00:00:46.980> hair

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
then this will work for you if you've

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.020 
then this will work for you if you've
got<00:00:49.170> darker<00:00:49.590> dark<00:00:49.800> dark<00:00:50.070> hair<00:00:50.340> or<00:00:50.579> like<00:00:50.700> black

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
and probably not going to work so well

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.709 
and probably not going to work so well
on<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.280> might<00:00:53.430> just<00:00:53.520> get<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.760> red<00:00:53.969> tint<00:00:54.300> so

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
on you you might just get a red tint so

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.020 
on you you might just get a red tint so
this<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:54.960> about<00:00:55.170> lifting<00:00:55.739> your<00:00:55.770> hair<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.489> then

head of hair
I<00:02:32.910> would<00:02:33.150> suggest<00:02:33.270> using<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.900> bottle<00:02:34.230> for

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
I would suggest using the bottle for

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.170 
I would suggest using the bottle for
easy<00:02:34.500> application<00:02:35.010> but<00:02:35.460> I'm<00:02:35.700> doing<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:35.970> roots

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
easy application but I'm doing the roots

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.730 
easy application but I'm doing the roots
so<00:02:36.330> I'm<00:02:36.390> just<00:02:36.540> going<00:02:36.660> to<00:02:36.690> use<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:36.870> brush<00:02:37.140> it

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
this out into a bowl to make it a bit

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.060 
this out into a bowl to make it a bit
easier

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
easier

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.979 
easier
let<00:02:59.280> my<00:02:59.370> hair<00:02:59.610> out<00:02:59.640> pick<00:03:00.090> up<00:03:00.239> some<00:03:00.480> dye<00:03:00.690> and

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
let my hair out pick up some dye and

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.210 
let my hair out pick up some dye and
then<00:03:01.080> what<00:03:01.200> I'm<00:03:01.290> going<00:03:01.380> to<00:03:01.440> do<00:03:01.590> is<00:03:01.770> just<00:03:01.980> cover

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
then what I'm going to do is just cover

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.449 
then what I'm going to do is just cover
the<00:03:02.940> regrowth<00:03:03.540> area<00:03:04.140> only<00:03:04.440> so<00:03:04.709> just<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.100> roots

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
the regrowth area only so just the roots

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.130 
the regrowth area only so just the roots
try<00:03:05.610> not<00:03:05.820> to<00:03:05.850> overlap<00:03:06.390> as<00:03:06.630> much<00:03:06.840> as<00:03:07.020> you

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
try not to overlap as much as you

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.140 
try not to overlap as much as you
possibly<00:03:07.530> can<00:03:07.800> then<00:03:08.160> I<00:03:08.220> just<00:03:08.370> use<00:03:08.520> the<00:03:08.760> brush

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
possibly can then I just use the brush

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.790 
possibly can then I just use the brush
to<00:03:09.390> actually<00:03:09.720> create<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.080> next<00:03:10.380> section<00:03:10.770> and

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
to actually create the next section and

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.800 
to actually create the next section and
you<00:03:11.130> just<00:03:11.280> flip<00:03:11.550> your<00:03:11.730> hair<00:03:11.910> over<00:03:11.940> and<00:03:12.540> then

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
you just flip your hair over and then

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.170 
you just flip your hair over and then

that<00:05:57.430> I<00:05:57.460> don't<00:05:57.580> stain<00:05:57.940> anything<00:05:58.270> that<00:05:58.510> I

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:58.540 
that I don't stain anything that I

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.360 
that I don't stain anything that I
taught<00:05:58.840> but<00:05:59.050> I'm<00:05:59.260> sure<00:05:59.470> it<00:05:59.620> has<00:05:59.800> some<00:06:00.070> sort<00:06:00.250> of

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
taught but I'm sure it has some sort of

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.010 
taught but I'm sure it has some sort of
processing<00:06:00.940> effect<00:06:01.300> and<00:06:01.570> here's<00:06:01.780> what<00:06:01.930> it

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
processing effect and here's what it

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.750 
processing effect and here's what it
