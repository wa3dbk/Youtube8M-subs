here that you can put in finishes it off
a<00:01:41.640> little<00:01:41.729> bit<00:01:42.030> little<00:01:42.600> nicely<00:01:44.060> opening<00:01:45.060> is

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
a little bit little nicely opening is

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.700 
a little bit little nicely opening is
quick<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:45.869> fast<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.740> believe<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:48.590> pivoting<00:01:49.590> on

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
quick and fast I believe the pivoting on

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.700 
quick and fast I believe the pivoting on
here<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:50.329> three-eighths<00:01:51.329> inch<00:01:51.590> so<00:01:52.590> i<00:01:52.619> think

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
here is three-eighths inch so i think

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.670 
here is three-eighths inch so i think
that<00:01:53.009> uh<00:01:53.810> attributes<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:55.020> lot<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.439> smooth

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
that uh attributes a lot of the smooth

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.249 
that uh attributes a lot of the smooth
opening<00:01:56.130> right<00:01:57.060> there--<00:01:57.119> o<00:01:57.329> spreads<00:01:57.869> over<00:01:57.990> the

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
opening right there-- o spreads over the

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.940 
opening right there-- o spreads over the
spread<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.070> contact<00:01:59.520> surface<00:01:59.700> over<00:02:00.030> it

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
spread to the contact surface over it

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.410 
spread to the contact surface over it
i'm<00:02:01.950> not<00:02:02.130> even<00:02:02.250> making<00:02:02.520> sense<00:02:02.640> anymore<00:02:02.880> but<00:02:03.360> oh

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
i'm not even making sense anymore but oh

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.690 
i'm not even making sense anymore but oh

the<00:04:25.570> grind<00:04:25.750> on<00:04:26.020> it<00:04:26.169> is<00:04:26.350> a<00:04:26.380> what<00:04:27.280> I've<00:04:27.400> been

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
the grind on it is a what I've been

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.330 
the grind on it is a what I've been
reading<00:04:28.389> is<00:04:28.630> called<00:04:28.870> a<00:04:28.990> span<00:04:29.350> toe<00:04:29.560> and<00:04:30.130> I'm

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
reading is called a span toe and I'm

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.790 
reading is called a span toe and I'm
guessing<00:04:30.580> that's<00:04:30.850> a<00:04:31.470> combination<00:04:32.470> between

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
guessing that's a combination between

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.460 
guessing that's a combination between
Tonto<00:04:33.490> and<00:04:33.520> spear<00:04:34.090> point<00:04:34.300> it<00:04:35.139> looks<00:04:35.350> to<00:04:35.440> be

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
Tonto and spear point it looks to be

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.650 
Tonto and spear point it looks to be
ground<00:04:35.770> like<00:04:36.100> a<00:04:36.130> tan<00:04:36.400> toe<00:04:36.580> but<00:04:36.820> then<00:04:37.000> the<00:04:37.150> point

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
ground like a tan toe but then the point

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.780 
ground like a tan toe but then the point
on<00:04:37.810> the<00:04:37.870> tempo<00:04:38.290> ground<00:04:39.100> off<00:04:39.280> to<00:04:39.490> make<00:04:39.639> it<00:04:39.760> a

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
on the tempo ground off to make it a

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.520 
on the tempo ground off to make it a
spear<00:04:40.030> point<00:04:40.440> the<00:04:41.440> tip<00:04:41.650> is<00:04:43.110> no<00:04:44.110> other<00:04:44.229> word<00:04:44.500> for

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
spear point the tip is no other word for

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.430 
spear point the tip is no other word for
that<00:04:44.830> other<00:04:45.010> than<00:04:45.180> extremely<00:04:46.180> robust<00:04:46.660> and<00:04:47.380> I

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
that other than extremely robust and I

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.689 
that other than extremely robust and I
guess<00:04:47.620> that's<00:04:47.770> because<00:04:47.949> of<00:04:48.220> the<00:04:48.250> tent<00:04:48.520> Oh

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
one thing i did the only thing i did

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.020 
one thing i did the only thing i did
find<00:05:26.770> that<00:05:27.190> I<00:05:27.220> didn't<00:05:27.490> like<00:05:27.580> about<00:05:27.610> it<00:05:27.820> was<00:05:27.940> a

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
find that I didn't like about it was a

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.070 
find that I didn't like about it was a
blade<00:05:28.270> stop<00:05:28.620> it's<00:05:29.620> only<00:05:29.800> passing<00:05:30.190> on<00:05:30.280> one<00:05:30.460> side

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
blade stop it's only passing on one side

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.270 
blade stop it's only passing on one side
and<00:05:32.080> I<00:05:32.200> does<00:05:32.380> not<00:05:32.560> go<00:05:32.680> through<00:05:32.919> liner<00:05:33.160> the

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
and I does not go through liner the

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.879 
and I does not go through liner the
liner<00:05:33.460> so<00:05:34.060> this<00:05:34.570> one<00:05:34.750> looks<00:05:34.960> old<00:05:35.349> it<00:05:35.620> to<00:05:35.770> be<00:05:35.860> a

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889 
liner so this one looks old it to be a

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:37.409 
liner so this one looks old it to be a
little<00:05:36.190> bit<00:05:36.370> bent<00:05:36.700> I<00:05:36.849> don't<00:05:37.030> know<00:05:37.120> if<00:05:37.240> that's

little bit bent I don't know if that's

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:40.710 
little bit bent I don't know if that's
because<00:05:37.690> of<00:05:38.200> abuse<00:05:38.530> or<00:05:38.710> what<00:05:38.979> but<00:05:39.720> believe

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720
