00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.690
 How are you guys since it's Monday again 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.000
 and we came back with our program about 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.519
 applications and games for iphone and ipad 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.310
 As you know, we search through the appstore 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.070
 the most interesting applications the 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.570
 we test and show them to you so 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.570
 let's see today's content 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.890
 many times when we take a picture we 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.260
 expose to certain objects or 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.660
 people appear in it preventing 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.460
 that our take is totally 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:40.340
 Professional can be garbage cans 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.370
 papers on the floor a poster in the nose 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.080
 of the car to eliminate these objects from 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.879
 dinner through software are usually 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.610
 use cloning techniques with 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.050
 programs like photoshop or similar 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.500
 that leave the solution to this problem 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.320
 out of reach of the rest nonetheless 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.260
 there are some applications how are you 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.360
 hd challenges that allow us without having 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.269
 my retouching knowledge 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:08.330
 clean of unwanted elements a photo 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:11.299
 in a matter of seconds touch of touch 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.130
 hd is one of them and it's so simple that 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.909
 you will use it more than right now 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.909
 think 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.350
 this application for ipad uses the 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.979
 same techniques that we have mentioned to you 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.049
 but automatically in our hand 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.689
 is the pointing out that we want elements 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:32.359
 make disappear from the photo point them 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:35.060
 with your finger and let the dash challenge the 

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:38.299
 eliminate leaving in its place the fund of 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.640
 the best image of the application is 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.340
 that when you delete an element instead 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.219
 it does not leave a vacuum but what is supposed 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.109
 that should be and this gets it 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:50.539
 taking samples of the pixels of the 

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:55.299
 environment of the element and reproducing the 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:55.299
 the result as you see a wonder 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.560
 there is a game model that is living 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.200
 its best moment and it is precisely the 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.780
 started by titles like temple run or 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.150
 break after it has been modified a bit 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.000
 the essence and we have seen improvements 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.250
 substantial as sap ways alfred and 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.720
 now we get another version of the genre 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.720
 call pocket click 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.370
 as the name indicates in pocket clean 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.739
 the challenge is to scale the maximum height that 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.260
 we can and recreate all the money that 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.659
 find trying not to fall into the void 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.390
 dodging objects and jumping on the 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:38.780
 precise moment to save a section without 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.780
 grip 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.430
 what 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.800
 the money that we receive will be useful for us 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.720
 buy improvements and skills later 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.690
 what will make our pathways 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.220
 climbing are somewhat simpler like 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.040
 rest of titles of this genre in 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.660
 pocket clint there are no levels as such 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.030
 the goal is to surpass yourself 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.030
 climbing higher and higher 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.790
 here there are no controls as such the only thing 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.130
 that we have is the finger to perform the 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.830
 timely gestures on screen that we 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.709
 let jump to one side to another 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.860
 or upwards depending on the obstacle 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:21.200
 that we are presented at every moment to 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.150
 despite being a style of game already seen 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.230
 in the appstore we have to say that 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.660
 pocket clean 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.770
 it's as addictive as the rest so 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.770
 we encourage you to try it 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.040
 ay ay ay 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.800
 you are a romantic and you love the 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.080
 classics because you're in luck because you 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.280
 has released a remake of his popular 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.610
 credit axis 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.410
 on iphone and ipad the classic and crazy 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.780
 racing game in which we put ourselves 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.360
 in the skin of a taxi driver and is 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.110
 pressing it in the appstore and we'll 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.110
 we will talk about him 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.010
 and taxi is a game in which the objective 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.500
 is to collect passers-by with our 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.410
 taxi and take us to your destination in the 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.170
 As little time as possible for this we will have 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:10.020
 than to resort to driving techniques a 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.750
 both wild and rough to jump the 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.570
 traffic signs do not respect crossings neither 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.140
 semaphores we go what we like of a 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.140
 good game 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.230
 completing the races we will receive 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.300
 points to buy improvements but eye 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.120
 because if we collide with people or others 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.610
 vehicles we will lose said money by 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.320
 so much in spite of the fact that I grew up a taxi 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.570
 title in which the careers are 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:39.200
 crazy we will have to maintain a 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:41.450
 some degree of sanity to drive the 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.760
 Cris and taxi controls system is 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.890
 It has adapted well to the iphone and the ipad 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.560
 We can use the accelerometer to 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:50.810
 rotate or also use some controls 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.660
 classics where to press to perform 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.390
 a turn and the graphic section is great 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:01.090
 no doubt if you want to take off for a while 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:01.090
 Download crazy taxi in your rival 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.810
 and we ended up in the section with avengers' 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.060
 initiate the adaptation to the world of 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.160
 videogame that marvel and the web studio 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.170
 of the games have taken place after the 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.380
 the film shoot 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.380
 avengers 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.190
 to highlight in this title two things its 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.740
 spectacular graphic section and the 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.539
 combat system that as we will see it 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:32.440
 based on the one used by the saga 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:34.210
 infinity play but eye not only there 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.310
 great similarities with the title 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.800
 mentioned but as we go 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:42.639
 advancing we see as almost the whole game 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.650
 it's a mere copy but in this end 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:47.800
 first episode the avengers iniciativ 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:50.259
 we will take control of hulk later 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:53.380
 in other deliveries will come iron man 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:55.900
 thor or the captain and america the case is 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.940
 that nick fry will send us to fight with 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.550
 several evil ones who have managed to escape 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:03.370
 of an ultra secret complex called the 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.259
 vault will then be when our 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.449
 endearing green man will have to 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:09.400
 confront each of them with the 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:13.030
 already mentioned combat system by 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:15.970
 shifts used in infinite and play to 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.440
 fight we will use gestures on screen will be 

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:20.110
 important to block attacks 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.449
 opposites and wait for the right moment 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.639
 to activate the sequence of blows that 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:26.409
 will get life away from our 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:28.869
 opponents 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:31.149
 and guys even if it seems boring we should 

00:06:28.869 --> 00:06:33.459
 say in favor of avengers iniciativ that 

00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:37.289
 the animations included make the 

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:39.719
 title take a substantial interest 

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:42.210
 try it because we will also receive 

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:44.550
 video sequences of the story between 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:47.580
 combat and combat what improves the 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:49.649
 experience before the game good guys 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.779
 well up to here the program of this 

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:54.149
 week we come back next Monday with 

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:56.930
 more applications and more games for them 

00:06:54.149 --> 00:06:56.930
 a greeting 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:06.009
 i 

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:06.009
 That 's right
