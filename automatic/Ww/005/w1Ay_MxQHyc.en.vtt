00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.170
 make some potatoes in the microwave 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.090
 truth is that one thing that I'm going to know 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.490
 how to use the thing first of all 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.259
 let's take a plate and I 'll take a 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.389
 dish as you are seeing here on plate 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.670
 normal and current and now come on I have 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.830
 cut potatoes which are you now 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.260
 I'll cut one with we'll have to take a 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.630
 knife and cut them the finest 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.850
 possible what is the finest potato 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.650
 possible because after 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:33.530
 so for fine 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.140
 and we are putting good first of all 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.590
 let's catch let's do what we take 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:43.309
 oil and we put a little on the plate 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.680
 oil of extra virgin origin what 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.150
 scrubbing on the plate because you're going to 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.949
 do what is going to be the oil for 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.519
 then do what the potatoes are 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:55.940
 fritas micro vett we take the dish already 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:58.579
 we have now thrown the potatoes 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.829
 We give you two vegetable gardens and we put it like that 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.079
 with all the potatoes this we have to 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.600
 doing fast because if not oil 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.880
 now with the cold is going to stay 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.360
 impregnated and that's going to be but let's 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.940
 do what 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:16.240
 I endorse let potatoes 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.760
 the bark for you to have been a 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.150
 more Mediterranean flavor 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.820
 let's do it like that to potatoes 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.730
 so if you want one you can do more 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.780
 potatoes is putting the dishes and what 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.350
 empty 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:36.350
 let's do it there we paste oil and 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:41.210
 we put together backwards there 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:43.130
 and we're going to put it like that now 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.600
 we will have the potatoes what they are in the 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.060
 dish as you are seeing I have already put 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.630
 on the plate completely now we take 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.070
 salt sea salt that is used to make 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.810
 what is seafood 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.880
 lowering the salt and we go throwing 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.820
 so that it is getting a taste of what 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.130
 what is the potato we are throwing and 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.820
 now we would not have done we washed 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:10.510
 hands and now they are dressing the 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.220
 potatoes the potatoes of the mill 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:16.010
 come here now we take the 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.080
 normal microwave microwaves 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.830
 you go with light and now we will have to catch 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.050
 potatoes and put in the microwave 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.510
 this is very important what time is 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.709
 microwave the microwave has to 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.260
 be at the maximum 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.209
 here the minimum here the maximum we will have 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.269
 that put it to the four stars what 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.100
 maximum the most powerful now we put what 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.510
 let's put five minutes and boxes 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.180
 Well let's see how are we going to put 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.370
 the five minutes there we will have the 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.760
 potatoes the potatoes are going to be doing 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:50.390
 by the light that goes from the microwave goes 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.940
 heating potatoes and you're doing 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.459
 in about 5 minutes we're going to 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.700
 put to see how we are but if it is 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:01.940
 raw we make it winning but we're going to 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.830
 be five minutes we are going to put them 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.690
 will listen as if they were popcorn but 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.690
 that's no problem here you go 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.480
 doing what is the extractor is already going 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.940
 start to see what potatoes are 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.140
 fried this means that it gives a 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.270
 good sign 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.400
 Well, we're going to get what they are 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.500
 five minutes have passed and we are going to 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.020
 there the microwave because it smells like 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.209
 that cheapens fries at least we go 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.190
 for the microwave we have already stopped 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.680
 right now you can put in the 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.080
 environment as if they had toast so 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.200
 less as they are coming out I do not know what 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.300
 that will have left but we are getting closer 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.870
 come closer because to move it than what 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.870
 we have here 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.020
 I can not believe it 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.020
 I can not believe it 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.040
 well the truth we are going to try to take 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.470
 the dish I have put it more time 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.620
 what because the screen could not be seen 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:01.519
 completely nothing but let's take what 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.519
 what is left of the potatoes 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.519
 ah 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.430
 there 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.000
 good 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:18.000
 we are going to 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.340
 try now we can see that although he has 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.340
 forgotten let's take them out 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:32.500
 that here 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.500
 the plan right now that will bake 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.919
 and here I know what a few topics but 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.530
 let's look at what santiago well 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:47.509
 here as I have the problem too 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.759
 the problem is that I have put 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:51.979
 more time than the one left 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:53.780
 then your five minutes because 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:57.530
 the time more or less than 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:59.000
 knowledge of the potato as it was five 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.710
 minutes but I've spent a little bit 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.080
 have remained what are some potatoes 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:07.180
 Now what we would have to do would be 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:10.340
 throw basil for example and now 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.580
 we would have to throw him out if we want a 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.580
 bit 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.020
 of parsley 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:21.169
 and we would have what potatoes are 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.720
 the only problem to put bare time in 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:26.090
 the microwave and it would already be solved and 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.440
 as we have here here is the potato and 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.129
 I was exactly what I should say 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.129
 how is it 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.060
 the sweet potato 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.870
 it's good the only problem change is 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.430
 that those two are too much but 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.590
 only with putting a little bit less 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.540
 time we would have what our 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.240
 potatoes made and nothing I hope there 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:51.100
