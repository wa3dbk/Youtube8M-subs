00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.380 
we're going to use is the nicad the
stock<00:00:49.270> battery<00:00:49.510> which<00:00:49.840> is<00:00:49.950> 1100<00:00:50.950> mah<00:00:51.390> 7.2

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
stock battery which is 1100 mah 7.2

00:00:52.390 --> 00:01:13.090 
stock battery which is 1100 mah 7.2
volts<00:00:53.250> off<00:00:54.250> we<00:00:54.490> go

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
this one is our 7.2 volt 1800mah nicad

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
this one is our 7.2 volt 1800mah nicad
actually<00:01:22.320> night<00:01:22.500> had<00:01:22.680> batteries<00:01:23.130> are<00:01:23.310> not

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
actually night had batteries are not

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.139 
actually night had batteries are not
recommended<00:01:24.060> because<00:01:24.210> they<00:01:24.860> have<00:01:25.860> memory<00:01:26.310> so

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
recommended because they have memory so

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:29.690 
recommended because they have memory so
actually<00:01:27.560> nine-mile<00:01:28.560> ni-mh<00:01:29.070> ones<00:01:29.460> are<00:01:29.610> much

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
actually nine-mile ni-mh ones are much

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:37.670 
actually nine-mile ni-mh ones are much
better<00:01:29.880> for<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.240> one

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.370 

sounds<00:01:38.490> like<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.670> real<00:01:38.970> boat<00:01:39.720> actually<00:01:40.020> out

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
sounds like a real boat actually out

00:01:40.380 --> 00:02:08.070 
sounds like a real boat actually out
here<00:01:40.940> on<00:01:41.940> the<00:01:42.030> river

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080

ok so it seems to be lasting out well
actually

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959
