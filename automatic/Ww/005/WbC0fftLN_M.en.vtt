00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.880
 This is a continuation. 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.519
 direct from that last video of domains 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.589
 What I did on blog tips is that 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:20.390
 teach you to buy a domain then 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:21.980
 You are here for the configuration you 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.789
 you do not necessarily need to watch 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.640
 that class 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.470
 but if you feel lost the link in the 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.119
 song is just you click and you go there 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.249
 nor at the end of that video has a link 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.980
 for this one and you end up not losing 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:35.600
 nothing then in this class is an average level 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.300
 because we'll set up 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.059
 some things neither dns so that your 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.730
 blog blogspot.com pass to dot com 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.500
 or the domain you bought later 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.120
 you paid and you received the confirmation 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.489
 via email 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.510
 You will enter the host and enter the 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.550
 your account 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.640
 in fact before I start doing this I 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.859
 I do not know if the other services are they have 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.289
 You do that but in the face you will have 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:02.420
 Then you go into your account. 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.769
 hence you will have this first panel 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.050
 thing you will do is click on 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:08.450
 domains and advanced management 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.850
 there is the zone of dns that is what 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.980
 We will change with your paid domain. 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.010
 it will appear here then basic and 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:20.330
 click select it and see more actions 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:23.060
 and managing dns here on my site is already 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.880
 all the dictionary then but not for you 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.610
 will obviously be so you click and 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.780
 will come here input and will put www and 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.780
 here at the value you will put ghs point 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.780
 google.com 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.230
 there you will click on create that already 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.570
 exists already because I already did then 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.470
 it's just in your traditional way 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.850
 the next step is to change this semi to 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.000
 Then you'll let it go blank. 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.580
 this enables the system to 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.090
 search or even when you enter the url 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:01.370
 without the www redirects to your site the 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.900
 value are you going to change to this number 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:08.530
 here I will make available in the 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.530
 description 74 125 103 121 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.650
 opa 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.590
 and then you click on create mine too 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.020
 exist 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.360
 so he's going to say that I'm going to have to 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.980
 try again because I gave some 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.690
 wrong thing but it is not wrong because 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.950
 I've just got that going for you 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.470
 work normally 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.500
 if you did all this right here 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.420
 role of the host is over so you can 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.850
 close your tale everything else 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.280
 and then comes the part of the blog you go on 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.500
 your blog and will come in settings in the 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.810
 blog you want to change will come in 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.060
 basics and blog address 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.730
 there you give a edit and you add 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.000
 here is your new domain that you bought 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.800
 with www a yvone will have an option to 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.370
 redirect you click here 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.380
 redirect without the www to ooo site 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.180
 You bought it and you 'll get it too. 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.330
 here that will redirect the point 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.550
 blogspot.com for your new domain or 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.590
 You were able to save and when you 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.600
 you access your site 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.340
 this may take a little 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.980
 mold 30 minutes to one hour normally 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.440
 but soon you will have a domain 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.410
 personalized and with a much more visual 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.420
 professional remembering I do not know if 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.480
 This is what you did now, you're going to need it. 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:31.480
 for other domain and hosting sites 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.610
 but for purple it's necessary I hope 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.530
 You enjoyed it, I got tired. 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.840

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.950
 favorite in and sign up for the channel for 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.950
