white review so I just got it a couple

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:17.970 
white review so I just got it a couple
of<00:00:13.030> days<00:00:13.209> ago<00:00:13.389> and<00:00:16.410> there<00:00:17.410> are<00:00:17.650> some

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:17.980 
of days ago and there are some

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.780 
of days ago and there are some
differences<00:00:18.550> between<00:00:18.820> the<00:00:19.120> white<00:00:19.570> and<00:00:19.930> black

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:20.790 
differences between the white and black

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.860 
differences between the white and black
for<00:00:21.790> example<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:24.340> white<00:00:24.610> one<00:00:24.940> doesn't<00:00:25.690> have

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:25.870 
for example the white one doesn't have

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.140 
for example the white one doesn't have
the<00:00:26.080> blue<00:00:26.320> LED<00:00:26.650> here<00:00:27.340> when<00:00:28.270> you<00:00:28.420> pop<00:00:28.660> in<00:00:28.900> the

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
the blue LED here when you pop in the

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.639 
the blue LED here when you pop in the
blu-ray<00:00:31.150> disc<00:00:32.879> this<00:00:33.879> LED<00:00:34.480> just<00:00:34.780> doesn't<00:00:35.199> exist

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:35.649 
blu-ray disc this LED just doesn't exist

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.599 
blu-ray disc this LED just doesn't exist
you<00:00:36.309> have<00:00:36.339> only<00:00:36.730> this<00:00:37.059> one<00:00:37.120> which<00:00:37.629> is<00:00:38.609> green

00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:39.609 
you have only this one which is green

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:43.559 
you have only this one which is green
and<00:00:39.909> red<00:00:40.210> on<00:00:41.109> the<00:00:41.710> black<00:00:41.920> one<00:00:42.190> it<00:00:42.999> does<00:00:43.239> have

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:43.569 
and red on the black one it does have

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:49.259 
and red on the black one it does have
the<00:00:44.260> blue<00:00:44.890> and<00:00:45.149> red<00:00:46.149> and<00:00:46.390> green<00:00:47.159> I<00:00:48.159> guess<00:00:49.030> they

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269 
the blue and red and green I guess they

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:52.520 
the blue and red and green I guess they
just<00:00:49.329> wanted<00:00:49.690> to<00:00:50.079> cut<00:00:50.319> down<00:00:50.710> the<00:00:51.179> production

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
just wanted to cut down the production

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.639 
just wanted to cut down the production
price<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:54.579> that's<00:00:54.850> what<00:00:55.059> they<00:00:55.210> went<00:00:55.420> with<00:00:55.690> the

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
price so that's what they went with the

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.059 
price so that's what they went with the
sign<00:00:56.979> here<00:00:57.609> the<00:00:57.819> PlayStation<00:00:58.479> side<00:00:58.749> is<00:00:59.199> just

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:00.069 
sign here the PlayStation side is just

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:04.710 
sign here the PlayStation side is just
spray<00:01:00.699> it<00:01:00.729> on<00:01:00.940> grey<00:01:01.870> it's<00:01:02.769> not<00:01:03.010> actually<00:01:03.609> a<00:01:03.879> you

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
spray it on grey it's not actually a you

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.890 
spray it on grey it's not actually a you
know<00:01:04.870> piece<00:01:05.710> of<00:01:05.940> aluminum<00:01:06.940> or<00:01:06.970> something<00:01:07.690> it's

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
know piece of aluminum or something it's

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.650 
know piece of aluminum or something it's
just<00:01:07.990> sprayed<00:01:08.470> on<00:01:08.710> and<00:01:09.210> here<00:01:10.210> you<00:01:10.420> have<00:01:10.630> a

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
just sprayed on and here you have a

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.660 
just sprayed on and here you have a
piece<00:01:11.080> of<00:01:12.360> kind<00:01:13.360> of<00:01:13.420> aluminium<00:01:13.570> I<00:01:14.110> think<00:01:14.670> but

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
piece of kind of aluminium I think but

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.080 
piece of kind of aluminium I think but
you<00:01:15.940> can<00:01:16.300> feel<00:01:16.570> it<00:01:16.890> it's<00:01:17.890> there<00:01:18.190> you<00:01:18.460> know<00:01:18.610> it's

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
you can feel it it's there you know it's

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.010 
you can feel it it's there you know it's
not<00:01:19.240> just<00:01:19.300> print<00:01:19.780> print<00:01:20.200> it's<00:01:20.350> printed<00:01:20.740> on

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
not just print print it's printed on

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.520 
not just print print it's printed on
another<00:01:23.020> thing<00:01:23.260> I've<00:01:23.470> noticed<00:01:23.500> is<00:01:24.460> you<00:01:25.530> see

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
another thing I've noticed is you see

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.110 
another thing I've noticed is you see
the<00:01:26.740> sony<00:01:27.580> logo<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:29.380> one<00:01:29.560> is<00:01:29.710> actually

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120 
the sony logo this one is actually

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.990 
the sony logo this one is actually
preston<00:01:31.470> it's<00:01:32.470> not<00:01:32.710> present<00:01:33.280> it's<00:01:33.520> just<00:01:33.700> it's

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
preston it's not present it's just it's

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.550 
preston it's not present it's just it's
bursting<00:01:34.630> this<00:01:34.900> one<00:01:35.280> it's<00:01:36.280> printed<00:01:36.910> on<00:01:37.530> so<00:01:38.530> I

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
bursting this one it's printed on so I

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:50.450 
bursting this one it's printed on so I
guess<00:01:38.860> it's<00:01:39.340> cheaper<00:01:39.760> to<00:01:40.690> just<00:01:40.720> press<00:01:41.230> it<00:01:41.440> in

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.230 

oh<00:01:51.900> yeah<00:01:52.930> another<00:01:53.260> interesting<00:01:53.950> thing<00:01:54.220> on<00:01:54.790> the

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
oh yeah another interesting thing on the

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.110 
oh yeah another interesting thing on the
front<00:01:55.650> as<00:01:56.650> you<00:01:56.710> can<00:01:56.860> see<00:01:57.159> here<00:01:57.370> you<00:01:57.520> got<00:01:58.920> okay<00:02:00.120> 2

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
front as you can see here you got okay 2

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.500 
front as you can see here you got okay 2
USBS<00:02:01.770> HD<00:02:02.940> activity<00:02:03.940> LED<00:02:04.659> and<00:02:05.290> you<00:02:05.890> have<00:02:06.040> Wi-Fi

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
USBS HD activity LED and you have Wi-Fi

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.760 
USBS HD activity LED and you have Wi-Fi
LED<00:02:07.510> on<00:02:08.259> the<00:02:08.920> white<00:02:09.130> model<00:02:09.670> you<00:02:09.850> got<00:02:10.060> 2<00:02:10.390> USBS<00:02:11.020> HD

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
LED on the white model you got 2 USBS HD

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.540 
LED on the white model you got 2 USBS HD
and<00:02:12.010> there's<00:02:12.430> no<00:02:12.730> Wi-Fi

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
and there's no Wi-Fi

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.110 
and there's no Wi-Fi
lamp<00:02:14.180> there's<00:02:14.840> no<00:02:14.990> LED<00:02:15.410> for<00:02:15.800> Wi-Fi<00:02:16.490> activity

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
lamp there's no LED for Wi-Fi activity

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.460 
lamp there's no LED for Wi-Fi activity
it<00:02:17.810> does<00:02:18.170> have<00:02:18.590> Wi-Fi<00:02:19.520> of<00:02:19.820> course<00:02:20.420> but<00:02:21.140> there's

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
it does have Wi-Fi of course but there's

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.490 
it does have Wi-Fi of course but there's
just<00:02:21.710> no<00:02:22.190> lamp<00:02:22.490> here<00:02:22.880> so<00:02:23.690> I<00:02:23.720> guess<00:02:23.990> that's

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
just no lamp here so I guess that's

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.020 
just no lamp here so I guess that's
another<00:02:24.770> way<00:02:25.190> they<00:02:25.460> cut<00:02:25.730> cost<00:02:26.210> in<00:02:26.870> production

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
another way they cut cost in production

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.710 
another way they cut cost in production
which<00:02:29.030> I<00:02:29.180> don't<00:02:29.360> mind<00:02:29.570> I<00:02:29.750> mean<00:02:31.000> one<00:02:32.000> led<00:02:32.360> more

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
which I don't mind I mean one led more

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.670 
which I don't mind I mean one led more
or<00:02:32.840> less<00:02:33.020> who<00:02:33.320> cares<00:02:33.760> and<00:02:37.630> in<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:38.840> back<00:02:39.050> looks

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
or less who cares and in the back looks

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.940 
or less who cares and in the back looks
like<00:02:39.800> they're<00:02:41.650> they<00:02:42.650> kept<00:02:43.270> the<00:02:44.270> same<00:02:44.540> thing<00:02:45.110> as

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
like they're they kept the same thing as

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.030 
like they're they kept the same thing as
they<00:02:46.730> did<00:02:46.940> on<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:47.300> black<00:02:47.510> because<00:02:47.750> it's<00:02:48.170> black

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
they did on the black because it's black

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.470 
they did on the black because it's black
in<00:02:49.250> color<00:02:49.550> and<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:51.650> connections<00:02:52.250> are<00:02:52.520> exactly

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
in color and the connections are exactly

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.980 
in color and the connections are exactly
the<00:02:53.660> same<00:02:54.370> as<00:02:55.370> you<00:02:55.610> can<00:02:55.640> see<00:02:55.970> now<00:02:56.930> the

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
the same as you can see now the

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.650 
the same as you can see now the
difference<00:02:57.590> is<00:02:57.830> that<00:02:59.260> the<00:03:00.260> white<00:03:00.560> one<00:03:00.920> is<00:03:01.660> so

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
difference is that the white one is so

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.400 
difference is that the white one is so
much<00:03:03.020> whiter<00:03:03.890> than<00:03:04.490> the<00:03:04.760> black<00:03:04.970> one<00:03:05.410> the

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
much whiter than the black one the

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.500 
much whiter than the black one the
higher<00:03:06.680> you<00:03:07.040> go<00:03:07.250> with<00:03:07.490> gigs<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:08.240> white

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
higher you go with gigs the white

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.350 
higher you go with gigs the white
quieter<00:03:09.410> they<00:03:09.650> are<00:03:09.860> I<00:03:10.160> don't<00:03:10.250> know<00:03:10.490> how<00:03:10.790> or<00:03:11.120> why

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
quieter they are I don't know how or why

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.410 
quieter they are I don't know how or why
but<00:03:11.390> I've<00:03:12.020> had<00:03:12.850> 120<00:03:13.850> and<00:03:14.890> this<00:03:15.890> one<00:03:16.130> is<00:03:16.310> 160<00:03:17.240> and

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
but I've had 120 and this one is 160 and

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.979 
but I've had 120 and this one is 160 and
this<00:03:18.050> one<00:03:18.260> is<00:03:18.380> 320<00:03:19.220> the<00:03:20.030> higher<00:03:20.270> you<00:03:20.480> go<00:03:20.690> with

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
this one is 320 the higher you go with

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.280 
this one is 320 the higher you go with
the<00:03:21.620> memory<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.820> quieter<00:03:23.330> they<00:03:23.510> are<00:03:23.720> because

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
the memory the quieter they are because

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.280 
the memory the quieter they are because
probably<00:03:24.650> it's<00:03:25.160> because<00:03:25.610> every<00:03:26.360> time<00:03:26.600> it's<00:03:27.080> a

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
probably it's because every time it's a

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.560 
probably it's because every time it's a
newer<00:03:27.500> model<00:03:27.830> model<00:03:28.760> so<00:03:29.600> you<00:03:30.700> know<00:03:31.700> every<00:03:32.330> time

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
newer model model so you know every time

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.199 
newer model model so you know every time
they<00:03:32.810> improve<00:03:33.380> the<00:03:34.070> cooling<00:03:34.280> system<00:03:35.000> or

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
they improve the cooling system or

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.080 
they improve the cooling system or
something<00:03:35.660> but<00:03:35.959> this<00:03:36.620> one<00:03:36.860> is<00:03:37.040> really<00:03:37.459> quiet

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
something but this one is really quiet

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.380 
something but this one is really quiet
it's<00:03:38.450> like<00:03:38.660> a<00:03:38.739> new<00:03:39.739> laptop<00:03:40.040> I<00:03:40.520> mean<00:03:40.880> you<00:03:41.150> can

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
it's like a new laptop I mean you can

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.940 
it's like a new laptop I mean you can
even<00:03:41.540> hear<00:03:41.930> it<00:03:42.790> the<00:03:43.790> disc<00:03:44.120> the<00:03:44.720> blu-ray<00:03:45.170> rear

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
even hear it the disc the blu-ray rear

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.290 
even hear it the disc the blu-ray rear
makes<00:03:46.640> more<00:03:47.120> noise<00:03:47.180> than<00:03:47.870> the<00:03:48.260> fan<00:03:49.000> so<00:03:50.000> that's

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
makes more noise than the fan so that's

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.820 
makes more noise than the fan so that's
how<00:03:51.170> much<00:03:51.430> quieter<00:03:52.430> this<00:03:52.670> thing<00:03:52.970> is<00:03:53.209> it's<00:03:53.930> it's

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
how much quieter this thing is it's it's

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.580 
how much quieter this thing is it's it's
unbelievable<00:03:55.810> so<00:03:56.810> yeah<00:03:56.959> that's<00:03:57.200> been<00:03:57.350> my
