00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:11.380
 hello everyone today I go back to a new video 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:13.420
 that yesterday as I had not looked very well 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.700
 I did not give you some details but today I 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.980
 I bring in these matches of the 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.460
 update information 1.8 of 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.019
 marks tatis these three interviews 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.380
 among the things that I do not have to see 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:29.380
 is the map they will expand our 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.070
 world is going to be bigger and therefore 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:36.150
 less so that to build 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.910
 rivers will be added which there was not or such 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:42.239
 some kilos they had but very young 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.660
 they are very scarce and there will be more rivers 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.660
 the whole map 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.260
 you 've all passed them that are 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.899
 going up and you earn a limit of 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.240
 increase the height above the 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.820
 clouds and they are also going to raise 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.100
 they were just huge mountains 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.690
 maybe some of those who have seen me 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.940
 yes I have seen them there are some very high 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.269
 posts were incredibly huge 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.270
 tall 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.820
 the terminal among other things also you 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.810
 they are going to give meat meat chicken like chicken 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:18.259
 roasted and you can cook and eat 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:21.590
 like all the food the food you're going to 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.869
 can put in stack or lots of 64 what 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.530
 which is back because it was very 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:30.170
 annoying having to carry one at a time 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.210
 for the compu 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.590
 and you should know that when you eat something 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.380
 an animation is activated that is 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.689
 eating will be added 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.630
 in this collection when he dies next to me 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.149
 will give a part of feathers create the 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.060
 rotten meat that gave in the compu this 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:52.110
 meat is going to put an aspect that in 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.990
 end offers nothing but good face 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.200
 will include new blocks these bricks 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.590
 they have is in 4 a normal model 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.170
 the world is what is like mosaic and the 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.000
 which is broken will be done by cooking four 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.880
 visas in the oven and stay four 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.429

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.070
 these bricks 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.720
 in our image of how they will be created 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.150
