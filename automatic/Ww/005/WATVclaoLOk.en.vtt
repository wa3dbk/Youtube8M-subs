so you pull that down this section then

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.390 
so you pull that down this section then
comes<00:02:16.390> forward<00:02:16.720> and<00:02:17.350> we<00:02:17.620> can<00:02:17.739> then<00:02:17.859> pull<00:02:18.130> this

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
comes forward and we can then pull this

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.240 
comes forward and we can then pull this
chest<00:02:18.820> section<00:02:19.420> down<00:02:19.859> and<00:02:20.859> there<00:02:21.010> we<00:02:21.070> have

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
kind of lacking in articulation but

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.890 
kind of lacking in articulation but
still<00:02:36.490> just<00:02:36.700> probably<00:02:37.120> more<00:02:37.390> going<00:02:37.690> on<00:02:37.780> with

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900

stars we can actually move the arms up
and<00:02:42.940> down<00:02:43.150> there<00:02:43.690> is<00:02:43.720> no<00:02:44.140> head<00:02:44.560> articulation

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
and down there is no head articulation

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.250 
and down there is no head articulation
there<00:02:45.370> though<00:02:45.520> the<00:02:46.000> wings<00:02:46.270> are<00:02:46.660> kind<00:02:46.960> of<00:02:47.050> in<00:02:47.170> a

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.360 
fixed position nothing really moves
there<00:02:49.570> and<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:50.380> legs<00:02:50.560> can<00:02:50.740> come<00:02:50.920> out<00:02:51.010> side<00:02:51.340> to

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
there and the legs can come out side to

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.480 
there and the legs can come out side to
side<00:02:51.730> but<00:02:51.880> of<00:02:51.940> course<00:02:52.120> that<00:02:52.240> does<00:02:52.420> then<00:02:53.490> cause

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
the head to flap let's take a look at

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.050 
the head to flap let's take a look at
heatwave<00:02:58.890> gained<00:02:59.890> a<00:02:59.920> really<00:03:00.400> quite<00:03:00.910> a<00:03:00.940> nice

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
heatwave gained a really quite a nice

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.300 
heatwave gained a really quite a nice

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
Dino mode the head does have a tendency

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.290 
Dino mode the head does have a tendency
to<00:03:03.610> kind<00:03:03.730> of<00:03:03.910> come<00:03:04.150> apart<00:03:04.600> at<00:03:04.900> the<00:03:05.170> seams<00:03:05.470> but

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
to kind of come apart at the seams but

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.470 
to kind of come apart at the seams but
slight<00:03:08.340> was<00:03:09.340> a<00:03:09.370> slight<00:03:09.730> paint<00:03:10.000> bleeding<00:03:10.360> on

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
slight was a slight paint bleeding on

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.710 
slight was a slight paint bleeding on
there<00:03:10.690> now<00:03:11.530> I<00:03:11.560> think<00:03:11.920> that's<00:03:12.040> okay<00:03:12.280> it's<00:03:13.060> just

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
there now I think that's okay it's just

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.560 
there now I think that's okay it's just
kind<00:03:13.990> of<00:03:14.020> a<00:03:14.110> mark<00:03:14.350> there<00:03:14.620> on<00:03:14.710> the<00:03:14.830> silver

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
kind of a mark there on the silver

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.270 
kind of a mark there on the silver
he's<00:03:16.570> got<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:16.810> nice<00:03:17.050> Autobot<00:03:17.320> logo<00:03:17.920> on<00:03:18.100> the

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
he's got the nice Autobot logo on the

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.000 
he's got the nice Autobot logo on the
chest<00:03:18.310> there<00:03:19.240> is<00:03:19.360> a<00:03:19.390> spur<00:03:19.810> mark<00:03:20.230> there<00:03:20.500> on<00:03:20.740> the

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
chest there is a spur mark there on the

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.030 
chest there is a spur mark there on the
neck<00:03:21.430> though<00:03:21.700> but<00:03:21.940> I<00:03:21.970> mean<00:03:22.180> these<00:03:22.420> were

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
neck though but I mean these were

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.860 
neck though but I mean these were
literally<00:03:24.040> super<00:03:24.910> super<00:03:25.150> cheap<00:03:25.360> I<00:03:25.630> think

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
literally super super cheap I think

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.930 
literally super super cheap I think
there<00:03:26.140> were<00:03:26.230> three<00:03:27.160> dollars<00:03:27.580> I<00:03:27.640> think<00:03:27.820> of

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
there were three dollars I think of

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.210 
there were three dollars I think of
something<00:03:28.060> like<00:03:28.210> in<00:03:28.480> Target<00:03:28.840> you<00:03:29.830> can<00:03:29.980> note

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
something like in Target you can note

severely<00:04:26.290> dwarfed<00:04:27.130> by<00:04:27.490> the<00:04:27.970> monster<00:04:28.840> that<00:04:29.020> was

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
severely dwarfed by the monster that was

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.420 
severely dwarfed by the monster that was
the<00:04:30.090> Optimus<00:04:31.090> Primal<00:04:31.360> but<00:04:32.050> they<00:04:32.560> do<00:04:32.620> look<00:04:33.220> good

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430
