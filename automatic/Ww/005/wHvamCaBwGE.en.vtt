00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:15.789
 so although good enough for our field I went to see it city 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:18.749
 tottenham near a forest next to a small river during all this 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:22.490
 time I'm no longer in each station to if the father in gironde did you go to 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:25.619
 the town hall to check if it was constructible from what I saw 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.679
 houses built not far away but it's not the question however l 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:32.339
 year to see if our land is buildable small huts in 

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:35.790
 wood next door is not our problem strongly that the crushed will have a project 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.820
 rather building plots could not pose a swiss house and the netherlands 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.129
 and the steps to follow you have to go to the town hall to check the 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:47.280
 barÃ§a the principle the land use plan one must check this for 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.870
 get the building permit back I asked permission 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.880
 to build on and then what else invited the mayor to 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.960
 castle-pork barbecue or squatts so beijing it's botox 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.800
 woerth is in net decline 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.590
 m in total insured for administrative procedures so this is 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.920
 normal I'm catching up with reindeer chained said 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.510
 with his dad who pretends not to save axel locals who did it 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:12.920
 prisoner underground 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.390
 and about this but the package contact me by the works 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.659
 in fact I thought the hardest that watching them 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.310
 originally field work enough to say that he was performing his 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.310
 success I'm very scared 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.570
 so that's what happens dexter I imagine that beautiful things he has 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.940
 explained his skeleton% and 3 no apartment in our turn we have 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.340
 decided to build our own house 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.760
 the water flows also I think we discuss your field of action 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.330
 we discuss understand for me the role of the architect is really 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.330
 primary 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.500
 also I would like to know if you prefer that we go through a missions 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.320
 at the heel rather than partially 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.780
 the employer so we can count on you to make an offer of 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.020
 building finally the choice of entrepreneurs and the negotiation of the 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.490
 construction contract 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.120
 yes because I prefer to go for work 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.120
 little present I understand 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.649
 like that you will avoid budget slippages it allows us to touch 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.479
 penalties for unjustified delay 

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:16.749
 I will check in fact I feel good to see + in progress 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.159
 this time I'm not graduating 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:23.669
 the chum mix of any action and academic training courage res 

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:26.789
 with a greater proportion of any type of accident 

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:29.569
 not that I do not trust 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.709
 but it's still about building your house 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.459
 you are sure to be able to manage such a project on my 3d software I managed 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.459
 to redo the taj mahal so no reason 

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:49.729
 that's why come out of earth why so much pessimism about this car 

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:04.389
 this bargain sale Friday that I'm sure that for him confident 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:06.030
 especially when I swear to you 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.799
 It's certain 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.589
 trust me 

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:11.589
 m monday 

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:15.619
 tunisia france 

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:22.510
 Putin 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.510
 tunis 

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:32.709
 with the baguette 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.869
 yes then at first I had doubts about the abilities 

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:38.359
 I always had one during our last flash visit to 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:41.649
 agriculture because you can finally yes I see it is far from being too 

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:46.349
 receive after this disaster orton no holiday reason I find 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:48.929
 so why this announcement me that takes things in hand 

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:52.549
 I appealed to real professionals who will make up for this 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:56.009
 improbably frankly I am very unpleasantly surprised it's crazy 

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:57.810
 as people had to disappoint 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.080
 because it means 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.190
 Yes
