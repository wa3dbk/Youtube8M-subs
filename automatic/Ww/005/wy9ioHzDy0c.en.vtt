somehow missed my entire mouth and

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.270 
somehow missed my entire mouth and
spilled<00:01:57.970> it<00:01:58.060> everywhere<00:01:58.150> so<00:01:58.900> I<00:01:58.960> had<00:01:59.950> not<00:02:00.130> an

talk a little bit about the white shadow
I<00:02:13.120> think<00:02:13.390> it<00:02:13.660> goes<00:02:13.810> on<00:02:14.050> really<00:02:14.410> really<00:02:15.340> really

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
I think it goes on really really really

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.300 
I think it goes on really really really
smoothly<00:02:16.090> I<00:02:16.540> find<00:02:17.140> works<00:02:17.380> really<00:02:17.740> good<00:02:18.010> as<00:02:18.280> a

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
smoothly I find works really good as a

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.610 
smoothly I find works really good as a
base<00:02:18.700> on<00:02:19.000> top<00:02:19.210> of<00:02:19.360> everything<00:02:19.510> else<00:02:19.960> and<00:02:20.440> Here

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
base on top of everything else and Here

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.890 
base on top of everything else and Here
I<00:02:20.650> am<00:02:20.740> supplying<00:02:21.400> it<00:02:21.640> right<00:02:21.880> there<00:02:22.120> this

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
I am supplying it right there this

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.570 
I am supplying it right there this
camera<00:02:23.260> doesn't<00:02:23.560> have<00:02:23.680> autofocus<00:02:24.340> oh<00:02:24.400> I<00:02:24.459> got

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
camera doesn't have autofocus oh I got

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.180 
camera doesn't have autofocus oh I got
to<00:02:24.670> autofocus<00:02:24.970> everything<00:02:25.930> which<00:02:26.470> sucks<00:02:26.800> but

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
to autofocus everything which sucks but

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.949 
to autofocus everything which sucks but
the<00:02:27.459> quality<00:02:27.640> is<00:02:27.850> like<00:02:28.150> 10<00:02:28.390> times<00:02:28.600> better<00:02:28.810> than

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
the quality is like 10 times better than

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.590 
the quality is like 10 times better than
I<00:02:29.170> don't<00:02:29.320> use<00:02:29.470> this<00:02:29.560> camera<00:02:29.800> so<00:02:30.100> yeah<00:02:30.450> okay<00:02:31.450> i'm

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
I don't use this camera so yeah okay i'm

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.030 
I don't use this camera so yeah okay i'm

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
showing you the purple pink and blue

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.500 
showing you the purple pink and blue
because<00:02:33.400> i<00:02:33.459> think<00:02:33.610> they<00:02:33.940> have<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.180> most

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
because i think they have the most

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.930 
because i think they have the most
similar<00:02:34.810> finish<00:02:35.410> these<00:02:36.070> are<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.520> shadows

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
similar finish these are the shadows

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.600 
similar finish these are the shadows
that<00:02:37.209> have<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:37.990> most<00:02:38.020> color<00:02:38.590> payoff<00:02:38.890> my<00:02:39.340> color

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
that have the most color payoff my color

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.000 
that have the most color payoff my color
payoff<00:02:39.850> I<00:02:40.180> mean<00:02:40.480> they<00:02:40.959> apply<00:02:41.440> with<00:02:41.709> the<00:02:41.800> most

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
payoff I mean they apply with the most

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.100 
payoff I mean they apply with the most
pigment<00:02:42.520> no<00:02:42.940> matter<00:02:43.120> what<00:02:43.420> color<00:02:43.630> you<00:02:43.810> using

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
pigment no matter what color you using

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.150 
pigment no matter what color you using
this<00:02:44.200> palette<00:02:44.410> you're<00:02:44.620> definitely<00:02:44.860> going<00:02:45.100> to

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
this palette you're definitely going to

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.560 
this palette you're definitely going to
have<00:02:45.280> to<00:02:45.430> use<00:02:45.550> a<00:02:45.580> base<00:02:45.880> but<00:02:46.150> these<00:02:46.390> are<00:02:46.510> the

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
have to use a base but these are the

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.930 
have to use a base but these are the
ones<00:02:46.630> that<00:02:47.260> are<00:02:47.830> going<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.070> require<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.490> least

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
ones that are going to require the least

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.210 
ones that are going to require the least
amount<00:02:49.209> of<00:02:49.360> work<00:02:49.570> okay<00:02:50.200> now<00:02:50.500> this<00:02:50.890> is<00:02:51.130> the

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
amount of work okay now this is the

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.760 
amount of work okay now this is the
green<00:02:51.940> that's<00:02:52.480> like<00:02:52.720> a<00:02:52.750> combination<00:02:53.440> of<00:02:53.560> you

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
green that's like a combination of you

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.260 
green that's like a combination of you
the<00:02:53.920> yellow<00:02:54.280> and<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.580> green<00:02:54.730> that's<00:02:55.090> the

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
the yellow and the green that's the

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.540 
the yellow and the green that's the
orange<00:02:55.690> and<00:02:55.840> this<00:02:55.959> is<00:02:56.110> the<00:02:56.230> yellow<00:02:56.470> by<00:02:56.860> itself

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
orange and this is the yellow by itself

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.670 
orange and this is the yellow by itself
shades<00:02:57.970> are<00:02:58.209> a<00:02:58.239> little<00:02:58.690> on<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:58.959> chalky<00:02:59.320> side

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
shades are a little on the chalky side

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.080 
shades are a little on the chalky side
so<00:02:59.950> you're<00:03:00.100> definitely<00:03:00.310> gonna<00:03:00.580> have<00:03:00.730> to<00:03:00.820> pack

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
so you're definitely gonna have to pack

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.240 
so you're definitely gonna have to pack
them<00:03:01.300> on<00:03:01.510> and<00:03:01.900> they're<00:03:02.470> probably<00:03:02.680> better<00:03:03.160> to

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
them on and they're probably better to

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.880 
them on and they're probably better to
use<00:03:03.610> wet<00:03:04.000> but<00:03:04.180> either<00:03:04.330> way<00:03:04.600> they<00:03:05.290> still<00:03:05.680> give

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
use wet but either way they still give

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.890 
use wet but either way they still give
you<00:03:05.920> pretty<00:03:06.430> good<00:03:06.700> color<00:03:06.970> payoff<00:03:07.209> but<00:03:07.630> again

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
you pretty good color payoff but again

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.900 
you pretty good color payoff but again
you<00:03:08.019> definitely<00:03:08.530> have<00:03:08.680> to<00:03:08.800> use<00:03:08.950> a<00:03:08.980> base<00:03:09.280> so

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
you definitely have to use a base so

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.490 
you definitely have to use a base so
yeah<00:03:10.150> you<00:03:10.300> guys<00:03:10.450> I<00:03:10.630> really<00:03:10.660> this<00:03:10.959> is<00:03:11.230> a<00:03:11.290> great
