00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:09.370
 hi in this video i show you how 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:11.380
 makes a nut milk through the 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.089
 notes bag I often hemp seed milk 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.530
 made that is very easy because that 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:16.810
 you do not have to pour through the backpack 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.669
 but most other nuts are 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.320
 and walking for example, very tasty ones 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:21.520
 almond milk 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.439
 Affectionate you should definitely have a night 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.090
 let it soak but there are a few others 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.079
 nuts that you don't have to leave so long 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.750
 weeks 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:30.399
 and those are macademia nuts that you need 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.920
 but fifteen minutes in the blender with 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:34.809
 blending the water 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.300
 maybe ready to do something through it 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.339
 what you like 'because macadamia nuts 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.710
 just as their website needed that yes that 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:43.449
 disappear completely in your milk but 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.370
 just to demonstrate how that works 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:46.660
 with such an emergency izak 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.280
 that also just by the need is also 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.440
 because I actually had 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.949
 want to use Brazil nuts and you have to 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.530
 you pour the nut store 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.019
 Brazil nuts that are also very fast already 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.879
 activated and soaked with a 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:04.180
 fifteen minutes to rinse them equally well 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:06.100
 afterwards and then you can use them 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.410
 yes that comes around Brazil nuts and also around 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.530
 there is a brown membrane and almonds 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.480
 so there is an enzyme in huberts in it 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.880
 it prevents the nuts from sprouting 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.580
 but as soon as they come into contact with water 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.350
 and while that dissolves and can occur 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.930
 germinating and that makes them alive 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.810
 for us and to finish it well afterwards 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.300
 rinsing also brings yourself a bit 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.770
 do not see that there have 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.180
 because also for our digestion 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.860
 we see we need just for the 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.410
 digestion 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.640
 well a whole story it goes like 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:41.680
 follows 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.120
 three cups of water on half a cup of nuts 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.490
 there are people who have more nuts 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:50.200
 but for a tasty milk 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:53.530
 I think that is enough three cups of water 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.280
 and these are soaked 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:00.990
 macademia are also a few kisses 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.880
 sit by and blended equally well 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.369
 surely a minute or perhaps 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.360
 a minute and a half to get everything right 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.780
 pulverize 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.780
 there he goes 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.360
 well that sum of equal at its highest 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.439
 position so it went very quickly at once 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.299
 but normal with the vitamix 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:30.189
 can you teach that class heintje 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:34.840
 slowly increasing 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:37.290
 well in the pocket that in a concept or in 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.290
 a comb 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.400
 look then you can squeeze 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.570
 well we also have the zoeva mixed 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.380
 therefore very easy to milk your milk 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.600
 to do with it 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.810
 I demonstrate it in another video clip 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.150
 also but this is still the old-fashioned 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.740
 methods 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.880
 after the pulp you can use it again 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.880
 cookies or finds earthy ones 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.050
 I think there is not that much pulp now 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.050
 will remain 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.890
 so still a little pulp is the 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.190
 left over 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:25.240
 so we have a nice yes smooth milk 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:27.040
 got with brazil nuts or with others 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.230
 Nuts such as almonds are handy to it 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.810
 it seven one more time 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.980
 if you want to keep the needle for longer 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.390
 because then it stays longer in the fridge 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.530
 good and he does not re re that you 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.530
 falling apart 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:48.970
 well back in the blender and then 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.770
 to enrich the milk 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.670
 always do what the oil so tasty 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.670
 coconut oil 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.870
 little vanilla 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.810
 this half a tablespoon of lecithin 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.810
 granulate 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.600
 these 10 very good features too 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.720
 management that I actually don't like 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.180
 tell on the video unfortunately but it is 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.100
 also a very good emulsifier 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.710
 so it causes water and fats 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.230
 connect with each other and then you stay 

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:24.700
 milk well whole and actually honey 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:26.940
 so I'll go grab it because it stands 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.940
 here 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.150
 you can also use stevia or 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.440
 coconut blossom sugar 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.400
 or whatever you find tasty 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.400
 approximately 1 tablespoon 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.300
 and this time it will be a green milk 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.830
 with 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.830
 chlorella a teaspoon 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:06.960
 so and now there is also new granola 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.629
 for sale 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.930
 these are grain-free muesli or cruesli 

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:15.120
 quite always on pieces and 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.699
 made from nuts and some rice milk 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.400
 I believe and this is further superfoods 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:22.319
 brown variant with cocoa and make you 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.590
 have a red variant with coaching best 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:26.759
 and as a and a green variant with 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.099
 spirulina and cooking 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:30.960
 which is also very tasty but we have now 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:33.680
 a green milk so I thought we were going to 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.680
 use brown 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:39.659
 so here you can add some fresh fruit 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:43.789
 possibly do but that is how it is already 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:43.789
 delicious with your nut milk 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:52.219
 yes that contrast is beautifully brown with 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:55.490
 the green with a delicious breakfast each 

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:55.490
 enjoying
