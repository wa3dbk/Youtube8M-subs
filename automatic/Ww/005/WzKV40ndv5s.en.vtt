00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
you're going to want to do is go to the

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.590 
you're going to want to do is go to the
third<00:00:44.789> he'll<00:00:46.340> just<00:00:47.340> on<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.640> opposite<00:00:48.390> side<00:00:48.570> of

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
third he'll just on the opposite side of

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.810 
third he'll just on the opposite side of
this<00:00:48.780> fence<00:00:49.050> because<00:00:49.350> I'm<00:00:50.070> not<00:00:50.219> sure<00:00:50.460> if<00:00:50.670> you

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
this fence because I'm not sure if you

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.750 
this fence because I'm not sure if you
can<00:00:50.850> just<00:00:51.390> grab<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.649> military<00:00:53.250> vehicle<00:00:53.399> it's

probably easier you might just be able

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.049 
probably easier you might just be able
to<00:00:55.230> do<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.770> just<00:00:56.640> drive<00:00:56.879> straight

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059
