decided to make another video to show an

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.340 
decided to make another video to show an
unboxing<00:00:06.270> of<00:00:06.509> the<00:00:06.660> heaters<00:00:06.960> I'm<00:00:07.080> going<00:00:07.200> to<00:00:07.259> be

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
unboxing of the heaters I'm going to be

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.129 
unboxing of the heaters I'm going to be
using<00:00:07.710> in<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:08.069> fry<00:00:08.280> tanks<00:00:08.760> so<00:00:09.750> this<00:00:09.870> little

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
using in the fry tanks so this little

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.620 
using in the fry tanks so this little
heater<00:00:10.349> is<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:11.929> 25<00:00:12.929> watt<00:00:13.440> heater<00:00:13.710> I<00:00:13.799> think<00:00:14.630> comes

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
heater is a 25 watt heater I think comes

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.320 
heater is a 25 watt heater I think comes
with<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.809> 12<00:00:16.020> month<00:00:16.260> limited<00:00:16.619> warranty<00:00:17.330> it's

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
with the 12 month limited warranty it's

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.390 
with the 12 month limited warranty it's
called<00:00:18.539> thermal<00:00:18.990> compact<00:00:19.590> submersible

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
called thermal compact submersible

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
to read temperature indicator so I've

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.389

information it's suitable for marine and

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.099 
information it's suitable for marine and
all<00:00:57.660> freshwater<00:00:58.020> aquariums<00:01:00.020> shouldn't<00:01:01.020> be

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
all freshwater aquariums shouldn't be

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.240 
all freshwater aquariums shouldn't be
higher<00:01:01.320> than<00:01:01.530> 30<00:01:01.770> degrees<00:01:02.219> Celsius<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:04.220> yeah<00:01:05.220> I

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
higher than 30 degrees Celsius so yeah I

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.550 
higher than 30 degrees Celsius so yeah I
should<00:01:05.519> feel<00:01:05.670> good<00:01:05.909> for<00:01:06.090> my<00:01:06.270> small<00:01:06.900> 20-minute

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
guys how they packed it construction

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.670 
guys how they packed it construction
manual<00:01:32.000> and<00:01:33.000> that's<00:01:33.240> all<00:01:33.479> in<00:01:33.659> Asian<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.619> I

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
manual and that's all in Asian so I

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.249 
manual and that's all in Asian so I
can't<00:01:34.920> read<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:38.900> don't<00:01:39.900> break

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
can't read that to you don't break

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:49.410 
can't read that to you don't break
anything

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.139 

okay<00:01:50.420> so<00:01:51.320> this<00:01:51.469> is<00:01:51.619> the<00:01:51.770> heater<00:01:51.979> I<00:01:52.310> think<00:01:53.030> this

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
okay so this is the heater I think this

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.480 
okay so this is the heater I think this
is<00:01:53.299> the<00:01:53.420> identical<00:01:53.869> one<00:01:54.170> that<00:01:54.380> I<00:01:54.409> had<00:01:54.679> before

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
is the identical one that I had before

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.389 
is the identical one that I had before
I'm<00:01:56.090> in<00:01:56.479> my<00:01:56.689> fry<00:01:56.960> tank<00:01:57.229> but<00:01:57.590> I<00:01:57.619> did<00:01:57.890> the<00:01:58.009> mistake

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
I'm in my fry tank but I did the mistake

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.109 
I'm in my fry tank but I did the mistake
of<00:01:59.350> not<00:02:00.350> switching<00:02:00.740> off<00:02:01.009> the<00:02:01.039> here<00:02:01.459> before

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
of not switching off the here before

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.059 
of not switching off the here before
doing<00:02:02.299> a<00:02:02.390> water<00:02:02.539> change<00:02:02.630> and<00:02:03.079> it<00:02:03.170> cracked<00:02:03.439> you

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
doing a water change and it cracked you

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:06.309 
doing a water change and it cracked you
can<00:02:04.189> watch<00:02:04.340> the<00:02:04.520> video<00:02:04.759> of<00:02:04.880> that<00:02:05.319> probably

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:06.319 
can watch the video of that probably

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:10.180 
can watch the video of that probably
about<00:02:06.409> 10<00:02:07.250> or<00:02:07.369> 15<00:02:07.490> videos<00:02:07.880> back<00:02:08.890> what<00:02:09.890> not<00:02:10.069> to

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
about 10 or 15 videos back what not to

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.640 
about 10 or 15 videos back what not to
do<00:02:10.310> when<00:02:10.459> doing<00:02:10.640> or<00:02:10.729> what<00:02:10.819> a<00:02:10.849> change<00:02:11.200> I<00:02:12.200> think

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
do when doing or what a change I think

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.619 
do when doing or what a change I think
this<00:02:12.830> is<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.069> identical<00:02:13.549> heater<00:02:14.209> and<00:02:14.480> these

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:14.629 
this is the identical heater and these

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:16.839 
this is the identical heater and these
heaters<00:02:14.840> are<00:02:15.019> only<00:02:15.140> about<00:02:15.410> four<00:02:16.310> dollars<00:02:16.579> I

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
heaters are only about four dollars I

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.589 
heaters are only about four dollars I
think<00:02:16.989> or<00:02:17.989> Australian<00:02:18.440> dollars<00:02:19.450> so<00:02:20.450> they're

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
think or Australian dollars so they're

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:21.910 
think or Australian dollars so they're
really<00:02:20.720> cheap<00:02:21.049> and<00:02:21.380> you<00:02:21.470> can<00:02:21.500> use<00:02:21.769> them<00:02:21.890> for

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
really cheap and you can use them for

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.819 
really cheap and you can use them for
small<00:02:22.340> tanks<00:02:22.819> like<00:02:22.970> this<00:02:23.060> I<00:02:23.180> think<00:02:23.329> it<00:02:23.480> has

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:23.829 
small tanks like this I think it has

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:28.330 
small tanks like this I think it has
some<00:02:24.829> sort<00:02:25.069> of<00:02:26.410> what<00:02:27.410> does<00:02:27.500> it<00:02:27.620> say<00:02:27.769> here<00:02:28.010> what

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
some sort of what does it say here what

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.039 
some sort of what does it say here what
scans<00:02:28.849> leaders<00:02:29.709> so<00:02:30.709> between<00:02:31.250> 23<00:02:32.000> to<00:02:32.180> 45<00:02:32.629> litres

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
scans leaders so between 23 to 45 litres

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:34.720 
scans leaders so between 23 to 45 litres
this<00:02:33.260> these<00:02:33.500> tanks<00:02:33.829> are<00:02:33.920> only<00:02:34.099> 20<00:02:34.370> litres<00:02:34.640> so

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
this these tanks are only 20 litres so

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.750 
this these tanks are only 20 litres so
that's<00:02:34.879> fine<00:02:36.160> so<00:02:37.160> yeah<00:02:37.310> I'm<00:02:37.459> going<00:02:37.579> to<00:02:37.640> go

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
that's fine so yeah I'm going to go

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.089 
that's fine so yeah I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:37.879> and<00:02:38.060> put<00:02:38.209> these<00:02:38.329> in<00:02:38.920> I'm<00:02:39.920> probably

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
ahead and put these in I'm probably

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.500 
ahead and put these in I'm probably
going<00:02:40.280> to<00:02:40.370> rinse<00:02:40.519> them<00:02:40.700> first<00:02:41.000> just<00:02:41.239> to<00:02:41.329> make

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
going to rinse them first just to make

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.300 
going to rinse them first just to make
sure<00:02:41.540> get<00:02:42.349> all<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.709> you<00:02:42.980> know<00:02:43.400> packaging<00:02:45.310> like

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
sure get all the you know packaging like

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.400 
sure get all the you know packaging like
debris<00:02:47.120> that<00:02:47.569> you<00:02:47.629> get<00:02:47.840> when<00:02:47.989> you<00:02:48.109> package

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
debris that you get when you package

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.740 
debris that you get when you package
stuff<00:02:48.620> in<00:02:48.799> factories<00:02:49.190> in<00:02:49.220> whatever<00:02:49.600> so<00:02:50.600> you've

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
stuff in factories in whatever so you've

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.509 
stuff in factories in whatever so you've
got<00:02:50.840> your<00:02:50.930> temperature<00:02:51.170> control<00:02:51.980> here<00:02:52.400> as

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
got your temperature control here as

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.330 
got your temperature control here as
well<00:02:52.730> I<00:02:53.030> can<00:02:53.329> just<00:02:53.359> focus<00:02:53.959> there<00:02:54.829> we<00:02:54.920> go<00:02:55.040> goes

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
well I can just focus there we go goes

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.280 
well I can just focus there we go goes
up<00:02:55.459> to<00:02:55.579> 35<00:02:55.850> degrees<00:02:56.329> but<00:02:56.780> I<00:02:56.810> don't<00:02:57.049> think<00:02:57.200> I'll

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
up to 35 degrees but I don't think I'll

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.740 
up to 35 degrees but I don't think I'll
be<00:02:57.410> going<00:02:57.530> that<00:02:57.769> high<00:02:57.950> anyway<00:02:58.250> so<00:02:58.599> it's<00:02:59.599> just

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
be going that high anyway so it's just

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.930 
be going that high anyway so it's just
to<00:02:59.840> keep<00:03:00.019> the<00:03:00.620> water<00:03:00.859> at<00:03:01.130> a<00:03:01.190> stable<00:03:01.489> sort<00:03:01.880> of

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
to keep the water at a stable sort of

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.539 
to keep the water at a stable sort of
temperature<00:03:02.480> rather<00:03:03.260> than<00:03:03.500> fluctuating<00:03:04.459> with

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
temperature rather than fluctuating with

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:06.970 
temperature rather than fluctuating with
the<00:03:04.730> room<00:03:04.940> temperature<00:03:05.120> so<00:03:05.739> anyway<00:03:06.739> thanks

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
the room temperature so anyway thanks

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.770 
the room temperature so anyway thanks
for<00:03:07.010> watching<00:03:07.130> and<00:03:07.730> yeah<00:03:08.180> I'll<00:03:08.359> show<00:03:08.540> you<00:03:08.599> guys
