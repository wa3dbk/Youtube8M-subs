 Talk guys like being another videogame. 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.900
 today I will talk to a game that even 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.700
 the ibooks producer sbad time the IISS 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.730
 mice to see luti 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.800
 This game is free, you can 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.060
 prehistory download it even android 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:26.160
 or even on the iphone in the apple store 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:29.449
 should also have your download the version in 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.640
 hd is also free 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.780
 This game is very cool, I really liked it. 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.910
 his 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.440
 That's why I'm making a video with 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.300
 better for you guys will see take advantage of failure 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.570
 and explain to you how the 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.570
 scheme 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:57.050
 basically the following you come here has 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.050
 three options to ride your way 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:05.330
 You're riding a little as you go. 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.590
 Are you going to move from stage 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.790
 You'll have more items to put 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.630
 in cart 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.990
 The goal is to get the little dog in the 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:21.740
 finish line 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.740
 You finished riding here. 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.960
 it was a way this way has to be 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.560
 efficient one and one star 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.560
 yea 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:43.470
 I think that's the goal 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:48.259
 if you want, this phase is already 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:50.460
 ready and I've done here on this stage here 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:54.630
 button in the corner 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:58.380
 you have a glimpse of every phase 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:01.200
 playing what you have to do 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.179
 the way you are going you will get 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.200
 who here for example up to a star 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:05.579
 what behind 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.830
 so what I have to do is envy 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.789
 this direct there comes a little 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.000
 strategy 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.810
 If I go down, here I go. 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.590
 learning to write something that you do 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.959
 from the mountain 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.180
 montoya already out there is not all 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:26.030
 cases that you use all the Indians who 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.030
 In this case, I left it out. 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:41.329
 yesterday 10 the beach you tight is cool it is 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:43.590
 a single play the stage is still you go 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:45.600
 increasing the difficulty I liked a lot 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.310
 for being a free game of the same 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.109
 game producer is excellent at 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.109
 quality of helton game 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:53.819
 the graphics are great same version as 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:56.160
 it 's not bad, it's good too 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.019
 It's up to the discretion of each one, but it's a 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.660
 game that I recommend low you get 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:03.120
 very entertaining staff, so you're a 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.450
