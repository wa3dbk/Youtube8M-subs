it<00:00:08.850> was<00:00:08.970> a<00:00:09.000> material<00:00:09.570> that<00:00:09.690> I'd<00:00:09.810> never

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:10.220 
it was a material that I'd never

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.010 
it was a material that I'd never
encountered<00:00:11.220> before<00:00:11.250> and<00:00:11.880> it<00:00:12.000> behaved<00:00:12.750> in

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:13.020 
encountered before and it behaved in

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.880 
encountered before and it behaved in
ways<00:00:13.559> that<00:00:13.590> were<00:00:14.040> unfamiliar<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:15.059> me<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.890> yet

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
ways that were unfamiliar to me and yet

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.510 
ways that were unfamiliar to me and yet
I<00:00:17.100> felt<00:00:17.369> that<00:00:17.550> there<00:00:18.270> was<00:00:18.300> potential<00:00:18.990> for

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
I felt that there was potential for

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.030 
I felt that there was potential for
controlling<00:00:20.520> it<00:00:20.700> and<00:00:20.820> creating<00:00:21.750> an

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:22.040 
controlling it and creating an

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.409 
controlling it and creating an
expressive<00:00:23.040> medium<00:00:23.580> with<00:00:24.029> these<00:00:24.210> materials

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:26.419 
expressive medium with these materials

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.479 
expressive medium with these materials
so<00:00:27.419> that<00:00:27.450> was<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.739> kind<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.040> tied<00:00:29.279> into

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:29.489 
so that was and that kind of tied into

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:35.120 
so that was and that kind of tied into
my<00:00:29.759> my<00:00:30.360> own<00:00:30.770> sort<00:00:31.770> of<00:00:32.030> scientific<00:00:33.829> interest<00:00:34.829> in

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
my my own sort of scientific interest in

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.210 
my my own sort of scientific interest in
the<00:00:35.250> world<00:00:35.430> you<00:00:35.700> know<00:00:35.790> how<00:00:35.910> do<00:00:35.970> things<00:00:36.210> work<00:00:36.630> I

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
the world you know how do things work I

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.580 
the world you know how do things work I
just<00:00:38.220> wanted<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.520> try<00:00:38.880> this<00:00:39.720> material<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.440> see

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
just wanted to try this material and see

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.400 
just wanted to try this material and see
what<00:00:40.740> I<00:00:40.770> could<00:00:40.890> make<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.580> do<00:00:41.880> and<00:00:42.120> what<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.420> what

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
what I could make it do and what it what

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.220 
what I could make it do and what it what
it<00:00:43.440> was<00:00:43.590> capable<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:45.090> then<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.810> second

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
it was capable of and then the second

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.230 
it was capable of and then the second
thing<00:00:46.260> that's<00:00:46.680> always<00:00:47.100> attracted<00:00:47.880> me<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.210> it

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:48.240 
thing that's always attracted me to it

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.600 
thing that's always attracted me to it
is<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.750> fact<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.350> interactive<00:00:49.890> it's

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
is the fact that it is interactive it's

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.440 
is the fact that it is interactive it's
not<00:00:50.840> you<00:00:51.840> know<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:52.170> static<00:00:52.770> one-way

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:53.450 
not you know a static one-way

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.050 
not you know a static one-way
communication<00:00:54.450> that<00:00:55.230> people<00:00:55.740> who<00:00:55.980> look<00:00:56.760> at<00:00:56.910> my

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.060 
communication that people who look at my

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.990 
communication that people who look at my
work<00:00:57.300> are<00:00:57.660> also<00:00:58.500> able<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.340> have<00:00:59.520> some<00:00:59.760> control

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
work are also able to have some control

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.230 
work are also able to have some control
over<00:01:00.630> it<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:02.130> change<00:01:02.430> what<00:01:02.970> they<00:01:03.180> see

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:03.240 
over it and and to change what they see

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.280 
over it and and to change what they see
and<00:01:03.799> determine<00:01:04.799> what<00:01:05.479> parts<00:01:06.479> they<00:01:06.689> like<00:01:06.930> and

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
and determine what parts they like and

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.590 
and determine what parts they like and
and<00:01:08.479> you<00:01:09.479> know<00:01:09.509> look<00:01:09.840> at<00:01:09.960> those<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:11.600> maybe

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
and you know look at those and and maybe

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.980 
and you know look at those and and maybe
avoid<00:01:12.990> other<00:01:13.229> parts<00:01:13.590> whatever<00:01:14.630> so<00:01:15.630> that's<00:01:15.780> the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
avoid other parts whatever so that's the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.459 
avoid other parts whatever so that's the
interactive<00:01:16.619> nature<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.539> a<00:01:18.539> third<00:01:19.200> might

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:19.469 
interactive nature of it a third might

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:22.399 
interactive nature of it a third might
be<00:01:19.499> the<00:01:20.119> the<00:01:21.119> changing<00:01:21.689> nature<00:01:21.840> whether<00:01:22.200> it's

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
be the the changing nature whether it's

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.809 
be the the changing nature whether it's
interactive<00:01:23.009> or<00:01:23.159> not<00:01:23.340> when<00:01:23.670> they're

00:01:23.809 --> 00:01:23.819 
interactive or not when they're

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:25.489 
interactive or not when they're
displayed<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.359> light<00:01:24.539> boxes<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.259> they're

00:01:25.489 --> 00:01:25.499 
displayed in light boxes and they're

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:27.520 
displayed in light boxes and they're
constantly<00:01:26.009> changing<00:01:26.729> there's<00:01:26.909> sort<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.299> a

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
constantly changing there's sort of a

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.279 
constantly changing there's sort of a
sense<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.880> things<00:01:29.880> aren't<00:01:30.359> static<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:31.259> the

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:31.289 
sense that things aren't static in the

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:33.679 
sense that things aren't static in the
world<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.829> there's<00:01:32.429> a<00:01:32.490> constant<00:01:33.090> change

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
world that there's a constant change

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.830 
world that there's a constant change
going<00:01:34.079> on<00:01:34.369> usually<00:01:35.369> sort<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.789> cyclic<00:01:36.420> change

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
going on usually sort of a cyclic change

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.149 
going on usually sort of a cyclic change
to<00:01:37.409> life<00:01:37.649> and<00:01:38.689> that's<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:40.020> pelage<00:01:40.469> has<00:01:40.829> that

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
to life and that's a pelage has that

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.999 
to life and that's a pelage has that
built<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.149> naturally

another<00:01:47.009> would<00:01:47.250> be<00:01:47.430> this<00:01:47.899> ability<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.680> to

another would be this ability of it to

something that the viewer has to

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.840 
something that the viewer has to
discover<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:55.979> it's<00:01:56.130> not<00:01:56.280> constantly

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
discover so it's not constantly

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.639 
discover so it's not constantly
