00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 Cuckoo is the team yale hailed 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.460
 today we do not find ourselves for 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.350
 the rest of the let's play of ocarina of time 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.330
 is rather for an answer to a challenge of 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.790
 this brand new system then for 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.840
 regret that situate in the context but 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.150
 that's right and more talk about the 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.359
 start so that's one of the system it's a 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.880
 chain held by a friend of ours 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:22.380
 captain maths and he's having fun doing some 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.670
 challenges from time to time he gives a 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.140
 objective or so we can offer him 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.160
 an objective 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.010
 do not hesitate to suggest him 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.140
 besides yes and so is for example 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.550
 there one of his last challenges was to 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.590
 to make the mojo tree 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.930
 so that is to say enter the tree 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.059
 beat the boss and all my company in 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.280
 less than 15 minutes and brood was 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.230
 said finally wear me or wanted to 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.620
 meet his challenge by doing the same 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.059
 thing 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.829
 we know that if you manage to finish 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.480
 15 minutes yes already I put myself the 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.610
 same handicap that he looks at 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.920
 captain match i lost my heart as 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.699
 you so there I have my time in hand so 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.840
 as soon as you're ready I throw it a two 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.220
 three 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.210
 it's gone for the video challenge good there he 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.280
 is a timer that appears for 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.790
 claim the time I 'm up 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.160
 the stop like that you can see is 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.920
 what is good or bad for me 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.000
 answer is no but much better he 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.800
 there are a lot better than him there 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.229
 a lot better than him it's a 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.150
 very French phrase I will try to 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.930
 give some advice on skin on speed 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:26.650
 run and the tree soft day there we do 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.479
 the elite and the ivy and company for 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.970
 to avoid activating the text of na vi 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.530
 and will come back as long as a notice 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.750
 we like to tell his life with you 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.770
 my roof 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.360
 in fact you have to stop when she 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.770
 becomes purple like that she gets 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.520
 return censorship to you see she's going 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.660
 Attack you quiet because that's it 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.630
 does tschannen his oil to a 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.979
 babel you hit unless contract of 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.369
 move she did not actually see her anymore 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:55.160
 building 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:59.240
 just as wrinkles is and will remain 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.380
 still please you so there in fact I 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.460
 not gone looking for the slingshot 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.360
 simply because I do not need it 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.360
 to return the long name 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.259
 so I managed to stay on the ground floor 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.970
 because I need it 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.010
 stay on the ground floor for a dock 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:19.349
 following is to use the boa the 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.120
 truck camel jo baba for for 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:25.200
 fly to the other side to fly 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.720
 we do not fly really we are here 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.319
 like that hop we come right here 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.629
 we do not have to make the right end 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.860
 sarlat because the edges of the canvas 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.030
 are not responsible because we did 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.380
 not to look in the direction of the 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:43.760
 Canvas good it's a little weird like 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:47.700
 as a way of saying but that's it at 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.750
 program oh I like it in the state 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.950
 that flies you see them they are there 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:55.769
 tourist he stays in the middle they do 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:58.640
 all is too beautiful good there I hope 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:01.140
 that I will get there to beat goumain 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.910
 would be nice it would be nice i think that 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:08.610
 I'll have a good time if I'm there 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:10.109
 happen you could have done a better 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.340
 time if you had entered adult link 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:13.319
 and that you had to use the fire of a 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.489
 even the fire arrows it would have been 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.250
 even faster than using fire 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.630
 in yes it's true arrow chung canvas 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.880
 is broken 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.280
 Well yes it is possible to enter 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.200
 the mojo tree in adult link by doing 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.970
 bugs and or blah blah blah finally brief 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.859
 do 1300 bugs we need all the 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.109
 time to show pride must do 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:33.750
 stuff when the love theme is a 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:34.910
 no game if you do not bug 11 not 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.500
 true 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:42.110
 it's a good game anyway not necessary 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:44.030
 to exaggerate in fact it's possible to 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.870
 beat a single round with the nuts my 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:50.320
 day I hope I'm going to get there 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.320
 good luck but him 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.380
 no I missed it's not serious I'm running 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.610
 after I run after I run after this 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.340
 book everything for a loan but goes up 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.420
 still we had to go to bed 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.550
 wait since I have not along 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.230
 well in time she will get through 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.560
 oh no the social dialogue has gone to 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.780
 through it anyway she's already going 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.580
 go back down she's not happy 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.580
 this is actually I have to destroy these two 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:20.250
 I explode with nuts she goes 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:25.830
 go back down to housing just to wear him a 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:27.270
 cousin little damage but a cleaver 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.000
 a chopper but hey it's still 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.310
 like that actually makes it technically 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.140
 we can beat it by raising 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.550
 stuff on the button and as I 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.700
 done in because actually there is a 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.950
 certain amount of time actually 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.910
 and so here but I do not know 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.060
 very much this time lapse 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.380
 I did not dare I did not want to try and 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.300
 the technique when I finished on my way home 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.900
 in the sami teleporter lah 3 minutes 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.669
 47 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.130
 according to my contraption 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:54.600
 badly I know what I could have done 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.390
 three minutes from vincent if I had not 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.240
 beaten if I had beaten the first one 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:02.370
 it's not bad yeah bravo minutes guard 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.290

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.950
 oh yes I was going to lose I do them in 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.050
 average 15 minutes so I guess 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.180
 Yes 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:15.330
 but not actually doing it is not 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.560
 equipped to make fun of mathias or what 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.390
 whatever I wanted I just wanted 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.800
 meet challenges like that for for 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.180
 to laugh true that it's possible it's 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.520
 not because here we like a lot 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.710

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.880
 to make the mojo tree in less than five 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:46.830
 minutes because it's not very 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.100
 difficult what I showed strong in 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.790

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.990
