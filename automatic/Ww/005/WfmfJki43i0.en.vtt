00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.050
 we have a great screen 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.270
 navigation menu there we have four 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.399
 different choices yourself 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.430

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.570
 to make various settings 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.190
 Let's go to the easiest thing we do 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.840
 all do when we go on vacation 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.539
 We want to enter our destination 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.270
 I press on search now then 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.680
 we can search and give address here 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.460
 for example, a city 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.290
 Let's give Munich a confirm 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.689
 Let's go by we green the 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.840
 press tick then we give the 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.670
 street name one 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.280
 and then let's just go to the 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.590
 dublin street again with the green 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.990
 check if we have one 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.030
 House number 1 just want to give up 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.280
 house number otherwise there is also the 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.049
 possibility to enter a crossroads 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.720
 if we do not know the house number 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:32.700
 then we take the 3 ok then see 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.850
 We are already here where we will come out 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.079
 in munich then we go on and 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.729
 then the already starts 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:43.409
 route calculation and already is the 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.350
 route because here we have again the 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.299
 overall view here we see how many 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.189
 Total kilometers are to drive and 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.320
 Of course, the journey time we up 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.210
 then you can use it here as well 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.009
 count down or just let go 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.290
 Press and we can navigate 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.619
 down here we now have the distance 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.969
 stand when we press on it 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.950
 appears a menu falls there we have 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.119
 The distance is the remaining time 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.119
 and the arrival time 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.980
 if we choose one such as the 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.560
 remaining time then remains only the 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.349
 remaining time will stand if we are now 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.450
 We can go back in the menu 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.900
 Here , for example, on my route 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.930
 give 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.760
 we can change the route we can 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.099
 show us a summary again 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.170
 leave where we are or we 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.900
 can also delete the route if we 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.400
 no longer want to navigate with 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.890
 of course we come back 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.780
 again out of the menu, we go up 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.530
 we have a map above 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.840
 small plus 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.579
 with the plus there is another menu 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.159
 on where we go a few fast 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:47.060
 settings have, for example, the volume in 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:49.010
 the navigation 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.420
 we can simply tap or 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.620
 set through 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.720
 here we have a red one 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.780
 setting for example for fast 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.819
 route slow route economical route and 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.930
 so on and of course we can too 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.299
 delete the route here 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.099
 an interesting feature is, for example 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:06.379
 if we go back to search here 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:09.049
 then we have the last goals here 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:12.109
 stand and here are always the 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:14.150
 two last given goals and one 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:16.549
 Another is that we have one here 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.620
 that is to say, they have always had an intelligent course 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.840
 more often we operate the navigation device 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.090
 and use the more routes will be 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.470
 saved then we can from the 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.519
 Select route we ever 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.349
 are driven 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.480
 here we have another one 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:31.639
 interesting possibility if we are to 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.459
 example again to go search 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:36.290
 we also search special destinations we go 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.799
 for example, on custom 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.840
 search 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:41.780
 We would like to enter a city 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.849
 I'm looking for a specific goal, for example 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.010
 I'm in Berlin and need a doctor there 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:48.709
 we'll just scroll on 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:52.220
 down with these two buttons go up 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:54.440
 medicine ambulance service then choose the 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.229
 doctor from I take now just times 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.359
 a doctor can navigate us there 

00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:02.659
 let us also schonmal here 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:04.579
 show where the doctor is 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:06.799
 interesting feature is also that we 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:09.019
 Diverse doctors can also call at 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:10.669
 which then as seen here is the 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:14.150
 phone number is also deposited 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:15.760
 Let's go to more then that 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.130
 dialing the phone number 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.060
 of course, I'll put it on again like 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.090
 you see when a phone with the 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.370
 coupled is working very well 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:30.270
 then we can close that then go 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.770
 Let's get started again and join us 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.020
 doctor to navigate 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.730
 we'll see you again here 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.180
 voransicht where we drive in berlin long 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.550
 have to 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:42.300
 we start going and it starts 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:44.340
 route guidance if we eg one 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.220
 Looking for parking in a city 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.200
 We search again for special destinations 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.210
 I want a parking space nearby 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.490
 of the destination then we just click 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.889
 on parking at the destination here in the 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.780
 Quick search can also be found restaurants 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:59.700
 on the way or gas stations depending on 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.860
 what we want or we go 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.690
 again on custom search then 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.330
 We can choose if we have the parking 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:09.870
 in a city looking in the way 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:12.000
 close to the destination or here we go 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.520
 just get close to your goal 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.350
 then we look for parking then 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.290
 Can we choose one ? 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:21.030
 couple chaos a parking lot outdoors or 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:23.729
 a resting place for example at the 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.070
 Highway car parks are located in 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:27.660
 big cities the most 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:31.020
 then we choose the park inn 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:34.590
 parking garage near our destination then 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.660
 it will continue to be new route then 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.000
 that as an intermediate goal and one 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:42.360
 is directed directly to the parking garage and 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.590
 Let's go if I'm up for it 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.270
 decided another 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:48.930
 to adjust the map view 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:50.820
 I go to this plus you then 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:55.289
 card settings and then I can 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:57.060
 Here the view mode switch from the 3d 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:59.370
 Mode on the bird's eye view 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.919
 then I can see that from above 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.510
 many people like me too 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:05.130
 of course, also adjust 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.410
 I go to cards again 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.030
 attitudes perspective and then can 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.250
 I'll go even further 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.910
 then get the navigation guidance 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.910
 like this
