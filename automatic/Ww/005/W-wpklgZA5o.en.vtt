00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:01.560 
hi I'm Tim Gipson I'm going to talk

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.860 
hi I'm Tim Gipson I'm going to talk
about<00:00:01.680> how<00:00:02.190> to<00:00:02.220> hang<00:00:02.550> a<00:00:02.790> heavy<00:00:03.060> wall<00:00:03.540> mirror

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
about how to hang a heavy wall mirror

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.930 
about how to hang a heavy wall mirror
now<00:00:04.710> the<00:00:04.770> first<00:00:05.339> thing<00:00:05.490> we've<00:00:05.670> got<00:00:05.700> to

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
now the first thing we've got to

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.120 
now the first thing we've got to
consider<00:00:06.089> is<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:07.170> attach<00:00:07.470> points<00:00:07.919> in<00:00:08.040> the

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
consider is the attach points in the

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.400 
consider is the attach points in the
wall<00:00:08.340> and<00:00:08.730> what<00:00:09.330> we<00:00:09.420> want<00:00:09.630> to<00:00:09.660> do<00:00:09.840> is<00:00:10.019> we<00:00:10.170> want

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
wall and what we want to do is we want

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.079 
wall and what we want to do is we want
to<00:00:10.500> use<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:11.280> device<00:00:11.910> that<00:00:12.330> has<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.570> higher<00:00:13.170> rated

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:14.089 
to use a device that has a higher rated

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:16.790 
to use a device that has a higher rated
as<00:00:15.089> far<00:00:15.719> as<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.080> amount<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.379> weight<00:00:16.529> it<00:00:16.680> will

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
as far as the amount of weight it will

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.950 
as far as the amount of weight it will
hold<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.400> usually<00:00:18.180> these<00:00:18.359> are<00:00:18.420> rated<00:00:18.840> in

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
hold and usually these are rated in

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.300 
hold and usually these are rated in
pounds<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.410> you<00:00:19.560> can<00:00:19.590> find<00:00:19.859> something<00:00:20.160> that

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
pounds and you can find something that

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.370 
pounds and you can find something that
is<00:00:21.270> probably<00:00:21.720> rated<00:00:22.199> around<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:23.750> 7500<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:25.019> 100

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
is probably rated around the 7500 to 100

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.439 
is probably rated around the 7500 to 100
pound<00:00:25.650> range<00:00:26.010> would<00:00:26.430> be<00:00:26.490> really<00:00:26.880> good<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.180> use

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
pound range would be really good to use

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.810 
pound range would be really good to use
these<00:00:28.439> type<00:00:28.710> of<00:00:28.740> hooks<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.250> we<00:00:29.369> have<00:00:29.580> up<00:00:29.789> here

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
these type of hooks that we have up here

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.299 
these type of hooks that we have up here
and<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.390> wall<00:00:30.570> are<00:00:30.960> very<00:00:31.349> good<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.710> use<00:00:31.949> these

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
and the wall are very good to use these

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.459 
and the wall are very good to use these
actually<00:00:32.850> self<00:00:33.329> tap<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.989> screw<00:00:34.290> directly

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
actually self tap and screw directly

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.180 
actually self tap and screw directly
into<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.190> drywall<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.739> they<00:00:37.739> give<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.129> a

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
into the drywall and they give you a

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.680 
into the drywall and they give you a
very<00:00:38.550> solid<00:00:38.940> secure<00:00:39.829> attach<00:00:40.829> point<00:00:41.210> that<00:00:42.210> will

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
very solid secure attach point that will

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.420 
very solid secure attach point that will
not<00:00:42.899> pull<00:00:43.170> out<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.590> they're<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.739> lot<00:00:43.890> easier<00:00:44.250> to

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
not pull out and they're a lot easier to

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.880 
not pull out and they're a lot easier to
use<00:00:44.640> than<00:00:44.879> having<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.270> use<00:00:45.329> toggles<00:00:45.989> then<00:00:46.739> the

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
use than having to use toggles then the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.260 
use than having to use toggles then the
next<00:00:47.129> thing<00:00:47.280> we<00:00:47.399> need<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.579> do<00:00:47.789> on<00:00:47.969> our<00:00:48.090> heavy

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
next thing we need to do on our heavy

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.560 
next thing we need to do on our heavy
mirrors<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:49.219> we<00:00:50.219> need<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.520> install<00:00:50.850> on<00:00:51.270> the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
mirrors is we need to install on the

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.010 
mirrors is we need to install on the
backside<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.649> couple<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.460> these<00:00:54.020> loops

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
backside of it a couple of these loops

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.580 
backside of it a couple of these loops
and<00:00:55.850> then<00:00:56.850> between<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.239> loops<00:00:57.510> we'll<00:00:58.199> install

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
and then between the loops we'll install

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.490 
and then between the loops we'll install
this<00:00:59.010> picture<00:00:59.460> wire<00:00:59.690> and<00:01:00.690> it's<00:01:00.840> special<00:01:01.109> wire

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
this picture wire and it's special wire

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.820 
this picture wire and it's special wire
that<00:01:01.829> has<00:01:02.420> a<00:01:03.420> special<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.500> know<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> lot<00:01:04.799> of

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
that has a special you know a lot of

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.010 
that has a special you know a lot of
tensile<00:01:05.309> strength<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.570> means<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:06.869> can

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
tensile strength so it means you can

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.410 
tensile strength so it means you can
pull<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.830> it's<00:01:08.400> very<00:01:08.490> tough<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.240> will

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
pull on it and it's very tough it will

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.929 
pull on it and it's very tough it will
not<00:01:09.630> break<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:11.070> once<00:01:11.280> we<00:01:11.400> have<00:01:11.549> this<00:01:11.729> in<00:01:11.909> place

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
not break so once we have this in place

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.399 
not break so once we have this in place
and<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:12.479> want<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.689> make<00:01:12.810> sure<00:01:12.840> when<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.200> loop

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
and you want to make sure when you loop

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.050 
and you want to make sure when you loop
this<00:01:13.590> round<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.280> loop<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:14.760> wire

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
this round that you loop this wire

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.760 
this round that you loop this wire
around<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.570> terminate<00:01:16.020> at<00:01:16.170> least<00:01:16.380> four<00:01:16.650> or

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
around to terminate at least four or

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.260 
around to terminate at least four or
five<00:01:16.799> times<00:01:17.240> so<00:01:18.240> with<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.540> wire<00:01:18.780> on<00:01:19.049> there

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
five times so with that wire on there

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.550 
five times so with that wire on there
then<00:01:21.270> we<00:01:21.420> can<00:01:21.689> support<00:01:22.820> the<00:01:23.820> picture<00:01:24.320> and<00:01:25.320> with

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
then we can support the picture and with

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.060 
then we can support the picture and with
our<00:01:25.710> hand<00:01:25.979> just<00:01:26.189> got<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.729> up<00:01:27.350> over<00:01:28.350> these<00:01:28.770> two

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
our hand just got it up over these two

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.069 
our hand just got it up over these two
hooks<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:30.360> course<00:01:30.570> one<00:01:30.750> thing<00:01:30.780> that's

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
hooks and of course one thing that's

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.740 
hooks and of course one thing that's
nice<00:01:31.229> about<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.950> wire<00:01:32.159> on<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.880> two<00:01:33.060> hooks<00:01:33.420> is

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
nice about the wire on the two hooks is

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.859 
nice about the wire on the two hooks is
it's<00:01:34.170> easy<00:01:34.909> to<00:01:35.909> make<00:01:36.119> sure<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.450> mount<00:01:36.750> your

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
it's easy to make sure you mount your

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.870 
it's easy to make sure you mount your
mirror<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.799> make<00:01:38.250> sure<00:01:38.430> it's<00:01:38.610> straight<00:01:38.850> up

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
mirror and make sure it's straight up

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.899 
mirror and make sure it's straight up
and<00:01:39.150> down<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.950> you<00:01:40.950> can<00:01:41.130> be<00:01:41.220> assured<00:01:41.310> that

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
and down and you can be assured that

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.380 
and down and you can be assured that
using<00:01:42.540> those<00:01:43.350> heavyweight<00:01:43.979> attach<00:01:44.850> points

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
using those heavyweight attach points

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.109 
using those heavyweight attach points
and<00:01:45.659> hooks<00:01:45.960> for<00:01:46.259> your<00:01:46.320> wall<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.070> then<00:01:47.640> using

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
and hooks for your wall and then using

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.289 
and hooks for your wall and then using
the<00:01:48.299> picture<00:01:48.990> wire<00:01:49.200> on<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.590> back<00:01:50.119> you<00:01:51.119> don't

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
the picture wire on the back you don't

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.210 
the picture wire on the back you don't
have<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.509> worry<00:01:51.659> about<00:01:51.810> hanging<00:01:52.320> very<00:01:53.009> heavy

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
have to worry about hanging very heavy

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.580 
have to worry about hanging very heavy
mirrors<00:01:53.610> such<00:01:53.850> like<00:01:54.060> such<00:01:54.450> as<00:01:54.600> this<00:01:54.840> so<00:01:55.530> I'm

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
mirrors such like such as this so I'm
