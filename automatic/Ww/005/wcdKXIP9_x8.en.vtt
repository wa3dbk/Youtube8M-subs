00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:52.510 
they've holed up pretty well the only
thing<00:01:50.869> is<00:01:51.049> that<00:01:51.320> they<00:01:51.679> are<00:01:51.710> a<00:01:51.890> little<00:01:52.310> bit

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
thing is that they are a little bit

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.120 
thing is that they are a little bit
faded<00:01:52.759> like<00:01:53.659> the<00:01:54.320> trick<00:01:54.530> to<00:01:54.560> getting<00:01:54.920> a<00:01:54.979> really

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
faded like the trick to getting a really

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.489 
faded like the trick to getting a really
good<00:01:55.249> color<00:01:55.759> payoff<00:01:56.030> is<00:01:56.359> scroll<00:01:57.020> your<00:01:57.229> finger

00:01:57.489 --> 00:01:57.499 
good color payoff is scroll your finger

00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:01.020 
good color payoff is scroll your finger
around<00:01:57.560> and<00:01:58.039> then<00:01:58.729> applying<00:01:59.060> it<00:01:59.270> like<00:01:59.479> that

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
around and then applying it like that

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.270 
around and then applying it like that
now<00:02:02.030> move<00:02:02.299> beyond<00:02:02.569> the<00:02:02.689> mascaras<00:02:03.319> alright<00:02:04.039> so
