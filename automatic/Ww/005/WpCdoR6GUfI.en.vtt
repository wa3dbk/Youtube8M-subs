00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:30.900
 we are the Sochi team 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.470
 played very well and created a lot 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.360
 moments 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.640
 we of course were not just here 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.430
 but, all the same, victory is a victory I 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.200
 very happy for the team 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.230
 Here we have a question that we need 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.719
 decide we quietly decide not all of this 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.430
 fast but anyway small 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.980
 small steps we do so I am satisfied 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.620

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.520

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.699
 wanted to congratulate 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.500
 it's hard to say we really 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:09.299
 today may be deserved more 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:13.229
 rather than defeat but in sports will win 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:16.380
 the one who slaughters big souls what 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.840
 managed to make an opponent on request 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.860
 by dedication by 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:25.020
 I will make no claims but today 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.729
 maybe we didnâ€™t have enough 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.479
 somewhere skill or hall on blood in 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:34.200

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.979
 question if you can 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.460
 One small mistake Sochi residents allowed 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.970

 Defense pouring line line of attack 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:03.170
 well ask for an attack well i will repeat 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.840
 that we have enough work 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:10.340
 which should be carried out well, here I am 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:12.380
 just would not want to not allocate in general 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.830
 There is a question that must be addressed and 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.290
 they will be decided so let's say they are not 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:23.240
 and just solve well, we will quietly 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:26.750

 everyone played with desire and team leaders 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.420
 ran forward and beginners and veterans 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.900
 the only thing that seemed strange in 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.580
 last minute nobody dared to 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.550
 final throw 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:46.600
 Well, this is not enough for us 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:49.160
 we had great chances when a player 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.010
 owning the puck was a good position 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.700
 greenery neglected cast and sought 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:59.420
 gears here in this we probably in this 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:03.950
 component we entered today rate 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:06.250
 the game of goalkeepers I would consider the goalkeeper 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.510
 played with dignity and 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:13.210
 and showed a good game thanks to the questions 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:17.070
