00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:17.220
 In the spring, this mask can be made any 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:21.510
 time of the year but in the spring and she suddenly again 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:25.820
 better absorbs and attaches to the skin so 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:29.750
 necessary elasticity and all that 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.160
 for this we need 1 banana 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:37.610
 whoever you want 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:42.629

00:00:49.920 --> 00:01:03.170

00:00:50.989 --> 00:01:03.170
 I'll take half peeled and 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:12.140
 if you have it soft who will be easier then 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.140

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:43.830

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.570

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:18.980

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:26.130

 prone to wrinkles ie you 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:03.560
 probably understood for this we need 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.959
 mustard powder 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.750
 usually this is my mustard 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.739
 powder and we will need some 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.889
 butter 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:15.709
 if you have olive oil if u 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:17.060
 do you have grape seed oil or 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.699
 Cedar oil 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:24.169

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:24.560
 sunflower oil water and practically 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:33.110
 everything 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:35.199
 but will need 1 teaspoon dry 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.199
 mustard 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:46.810

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:54.040
 a spoonful of cedar oil, that is, it turns out 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:57.220
 2 teaspoons and there we will 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:01.690
 do not boil hot water 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.650
 but such a hot bit and all this 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:07.920
 stir 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.920
 I first let half a teaspoon 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:14.830
 hot water if you can see little 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:16.900
 dryish still lower a little bit that is 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:21.400
 generally need somewhere from the initial needs 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:24.490
 water 100 here as an assistant will see everything 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:29.890
 don't need to be too thick 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:34.800
 if not thick add more in the can 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:40.090
 add a little more oil then that is and 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.860

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.040
 skin 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:47.170
 will burn too much clean if 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.050
 do you have any damage on your skin 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:54.450
 Do not use this mask , but this mask 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:58.150

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:10.450
 I will come back to normal 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:12.880
 use see it should not be 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:17.290
 liquid it should be like a thick thick 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:20.670
 sour cream and in a thin thin layer apply 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:20.670
