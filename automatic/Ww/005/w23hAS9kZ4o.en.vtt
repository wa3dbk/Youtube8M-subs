00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 One last time I can get in touch 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.790
 near an Austrian rates 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.740
 because today in ulrichsberg the 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.429
 third and final test game for ours 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.960
 sky blue instead 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.969
 we had already on wednesday 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.540
 played because it has only a draw 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.639
 enough 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.109
 Let's see if there is a victory for today 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.460
 our boys jump out yesterday 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.880
 You could in any case at the free 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.320
 tidy up in the afternoon 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.850
 regenerate and personalize the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.220
 I'll take kevin art in advance 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.510
 will be over the full 90 minutes 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.890
 try our box clean too 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.640
 We keep pushing the guys naturally 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.050
 the thumbs 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.759
 let's see briefly in the 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.440
 Preparations in warm up here 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.790
 the race and then switch course 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.790
 directly into the game again 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.320
 at three in the lot in 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.660
 this last test game under the 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.400
 Watching Ahlen Coach Peter 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.160
 a man himself a picture 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.440
 our deficit wants to do ours 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.730
 boys clearly dominated the game 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.650
 always got clever again 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.540
 standards out as in this situation 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.550
 after nine minutes the high ball 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.890
 beaten off from endres in the 16s 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.300
 brought so loony and ragged takes him 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.160
 with balloons gate 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.540
 and there it is already so fast 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.950
 It can go with the one to zero 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.229
 and otherwise our boys could 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.020
 Prevent any attack by the opponent 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.210
 Switching fast has very good 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.820
 works she always left the ball 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.950
 again fine running capo gets the ball 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.630
 here on the left and then try that 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.820
 also at the penalty area with the 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.530
 flank and even if this is not here 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.390
 found one hundred percent of her fellow players 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.280
 so the offensive efforts were clear 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.830
 felt and had our sky blue 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.390
 the game firmly in the grip for good one 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.100
 half hour then the next 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.540
 Good scene on the right edge of the penalty area 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.120
 our guys play the ball 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.730
 Gorgeous to end it gets him finch 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.410
 here goes the rows gets the back 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.420
 and of course try with the 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.660
 Unfortunately, this is still enough 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.820
 not for the 2 to zero in any case 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.260
 but you had the feeling that the 10 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.700
 on the contrary, we would wiggle them 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.860
 here just before the break with the shot 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.500
 on the gate a bit too far over it otherwise 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.269
 only our cfc at the pusher also after 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.890
 the page change again the team of 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.690
 karsten heine on the right with this time 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.120
 Fink and Qigong is the ball going in the 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.590
 Penal space is back for him 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.900
 decide milliseconds millimeter 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.850
 otherwise the thing would probably be 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.250
 gone in and increased the chances 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.930
 kevin kunz repulses himself long 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.850
 ball extended by the head and johnny depp 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.830
 and then it's our captain Anton Fink 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.860
 he tries directly and gets annoyed 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.239
 Of course the choice is not in the 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.920
 netz fidgets maybe short 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.420
 take a breather during the drink break and then 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.489
 ran with cool head again 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.980
 74 minute free kick right at the 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.680
 the penalty area anton fink makes it 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.230
 already sunk again 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.800
 test play a free kick directly like 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:17.950
 already at 2 1 on Wednesday only this time 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:21.000
 this time the zero is 200 back 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.650
 this time without a clean result 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:30.010
 arose after the gates of chris whole 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:31.330
 berg and anton fink 2020 win ours 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.650
 blue this third and last 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.390
 not only test this for this 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.430
 training camp no but generally for 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.930
 the season preparation of the next week 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.060
 it is already going on against Ahlen and 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.410
 then our guys have to steam properly 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.450
 But now it is called in 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.250
 then calm down then put your feet up 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.900
 because they did a great job 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.460
 not only our boys but of course 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.330
 also the team behind the goal that should 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.740
 here at this place 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.880
 mention praise and I would 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.860
 suggest we listen again 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.300
 purely in a few interviews especially 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.670
 course in the conclusion statement 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.100
 our editor christian beck is 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.690
 for me the scorer for 1 0 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.950
 I would say so this last one 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.630
 test game was a round thing as 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.610
 conclusion or yes I think so too 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.890
 can not really feel good after 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.940
 drive home or caught tomorrow after 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.520
 home today new hotel 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.430
 I think today has a lot already 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.870
 but of course you can do it again 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.609
 optimize have a week time 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.959
 but it was a good test and believes 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.310
 gives us a very good feeling 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.830
 So I settled in very well 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.910
 But that was the feeling from the first day 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.440
 you feel really comfortable in the team 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.970
 the guys are really great 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.850
 very easy every newcomer that you can 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.010
 feels good and yes I feel 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.630
 fiddle in the troops, I think that 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.280
 fit between human super and 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.280
 fits in the place always better and 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.000
 right now I am very happy that 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.560
 So it does not just work 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.050
 footballing but a prize 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.490
 humor while thinking yes anyway with me 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.950
 anyone who knows me a bit knows 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.360
 that I'm a relatively fun guy , too 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.200
 needs and I think it comes the 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.300
 team to 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.310
 Here we are from the team 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.480
 even closer together and we 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.520
 had time we know the 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.490
 whole new with the older players 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.470
 who were already there and the team spirit 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.330
 fits like you saw yesterday fifa 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.830
 tournament and now we want to go to the 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.940
 season yes I've already said satisfied 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.740
 that was my best so far 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.520
 summer training camp what i ever experienced 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.220
 have 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.680
 from the hotel the condition of the first 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.360
 Lawn was just perfect and now 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.400
 just have to take the season 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.690
 yes I had already announced the words 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.340
 our chief trainer who cares 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.690
 us of course burning first game 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.830
 won two to zero I think that is 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.270
 a good graduation for this 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.880
 training camp 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.430
 Absolutely because if you have a whole week 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.740
 hard work then you want 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.600
 ideally still having a sense of achievement 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.610
 take as I said the 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.220
 results already secondary are but 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.990
 you do not want to lose and the 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.310
 troupe today like me for her best 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.790
 performance brought 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:47.950
 in preparation and earns 2 today 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.750
 0 won so that you can say all around 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.710
 I'll grab those now 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.230
 next question 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:57.010
 the training camp has its meaning and 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:58.330
 purpose fulfilled we have the new or 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.790
 the new ones have integrated very well 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:03.360
 So the troop is next to the hard one 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:07.450
 work also provided for yourself a lot of fun 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.500
 and the results have now voted 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:10.690
 we are playful here 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.510
 improved while being clear 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:15.730
 It does not have to be that preparation 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:18.730
 Let's go and we want to get ready 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.810
 and then we would see as we do 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:22.030
 worked here in the preparation 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.470
 have ok and the test player is 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.220
 of course always been an issue 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.650
 this week 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.090
 What else can you tell us? 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.760
 have a lot during the week 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:33.310
 we are going to rest now and say it 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:37.030
 sit down again what partly 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:38.920
 has been through the newspapers enthusiastic 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:41.410
 that is not all mature 

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:44.530
 be and again completely calm the 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.590
 see things discuss with the boys 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.470
 talk again 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.910
 and will certainly be one on monday 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:52.520
 announce decision 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:56.300
 Both have tried very hard here 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:58.850
 and we will see how we feel about it 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:00.440
 One last question seems to be there yet 

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.850
 is not the footballing but 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.130
 also the general environment the players 

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:05.180
 very pleased with the location here 

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.010
 actually everything fit the same 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.900
 training ground 

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:11.060
 what does the cheftrainer say that's it 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.430
 most important when we go to the training camp 

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.360
 we need a decent ride 

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:16.970
 accommodation 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.870
 we had them or still have them 

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.910
 till tomorrow 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:22.000
 and the most important are the 

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:25.120
 conditions around it so that one 

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.250
 has enough opportunities for regeneration 

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:30.230
 and b that we are optimal 

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.610
 had training conditions and 

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.980
 We had that here, that's us 

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:36.290
 Of course, before exactly looked at the 

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:38.290
 Stephan bag was here on the spot so that 

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:42.020
 That did not surprise us 

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:44.270
 good luck with the weather when one of the 

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.710
 high temperatures are now in 

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:47.030
 The last two days prevail 

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:48.800
 but you have to go through it 

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:51.020
 I think it is much more pleasant 

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:54.860
 as if we were raining here every day 

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:57.350
 So it must have endured 

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:59.240
 has fit around everything and I think 

00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:00.530
 that we have used so well that has 

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.270
 me, of course, that all then 

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:03.290
 fruits wishing to start the season 

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.580
 the team and the head coach kassen 

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:07.630
 a all good and much success 

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.630
 thank you very much
