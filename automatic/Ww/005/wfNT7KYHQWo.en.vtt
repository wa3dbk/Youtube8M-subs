00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:16.010
 if windows wants you and with friends from 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.600
 How are you welcome to a 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.330
 new video by michael pocket edition 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.610
 guys and in this case it 's a summary of 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.140
 the news that the developers of 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.960
 minecraft well they gave us in their 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.700
 livestream and if for those who did not know 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.620
 recently the developers of 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.899
 minecraft made a live event 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.880
 answering questions how he celebrated 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:37.190
 courses more than 30 million downloads 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.739
 of the game obviously without counting the 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.540
 pirates and for boys the event lasted 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.180
 little more than half an hour and now I'm going to 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.680
 try to extract and also understand what 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.600
 it was what they were answering 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.760
 villarreal and the developers of 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.290
 background minecraft probably 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.210
 I leave a gameplay of smash bros brawl 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.520
 because he had nothing else to put of 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.320
 background but good let's go with the video 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.050
 the live begin with the two 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.780
 2000 main developers johan and 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.250
 also a driver showed up and 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.110
 that's how it started with the first 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.730
 question and well the first question was 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.160
 basically 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.810
 with the boats that delve with the boats and 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.090
 the answer they gave was that the 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.040
 design of the pc pots was growing 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.960
 too much in michaels pocket edition that 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.970
 It is very difficult and frustrating to use them 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.100
 trying to be the most comfortable for the 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.780
 better fingerprints and also that they 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.730
 like to show the progress they have 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.830
 but they still have the design of the magic 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.020
 arts so it's not very comfortable for them 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.180
 when it will have control support 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.490
 external and the response they gave 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.230
 probably after the summer of this 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.990
 year probably for the next 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.540
 version after 0.11 point zero 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.520
 already with the next question when 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.620
 they will add the sprint without goals or king 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.210
 and michael pocket edition just in case 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.680
 you know is printing is the option for 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.690
 run faster than it is today 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.850
 we have snake in game day when 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.410
 you press shift on pc marks the 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.150
 answer they gave was that so 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.530
 less shifting will be added when 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.390
 add the new controls to 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.430
 minecraft I saw the next question was 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.860
 when they will add the view in third 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.720
 person like when we press f3 on 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.610
 minecraft vice the answer was that no 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.740
 they have their plan to segregate that option 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.560
 that it is better to add new things besides 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.790
 of that already with the next question 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.129
 will add an infinite neder 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.900
 in the world of LEDs the answer that 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:20.209
 gave was that if they plan to add the 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.769
 hell in infinite mode alone that 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.930
 will continue to use the rector of the cne there 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.670
 but think about making better plans for 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.920
 he and about lens also think 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.810
 add it the next question was what 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.209
 things they would like to add totally 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.430
 minecraft pocket edition new to the 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.500
 tomaso's answers was weapons I want 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.959
 create weapons but obviously he said it in 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.700
 sarcastic form later explained 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.870
 that you would like to add new biomes 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.790
 underground 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.590
 johan said he would like to add 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.569
 flags if I did not misunderstand the 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.689
 sight and good already in the next 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.709
 question this was very interesting 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:53.480
 they asked there will be some new 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.819
 developer for minecraft pocket 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.430
 edition to which tomás answered yes 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.379
 which in fact will be three guys who 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.970
 work for main casting that 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:03.799
 probably in March in February 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.689
 depending on those guys when 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.819
 start working the next 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:10.340
 question was how is the support for 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:12.079
 motorcycles in minecraft and both responded 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.299
 that are not trying to make it more 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:16.159
 easy to make mods some new things 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.229
 who lived were useful to create what 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:20.400
 that we have now and will not add 

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:22.950
 more symbols for the game code 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.319
 the next question was when to add 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.510
 to the region the answer was that they want 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.489
 add more things to microsoft bill before 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.439
 that you add the redstone maybe you 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.750
 add before michael and be in 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:36.180
 beta phase if you do not know minecraft and 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.340
 it is currently in alpha phase 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.890
 next question was they are going to return the 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.079
 minecraft and rivers both developers 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.239
 they answered that if only that not yet 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:47.670
 they have the exact date but it will be so 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.200
 soon as possible in fact one of 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.540
 the new developers of minecraft 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.579
 will focus directly on the 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.280
 development of the new rounds for 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:59.430
 minecraft I saw the next question was 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.500
 how will the skins add to minecraft and and 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.569
 the answer was that it probably is 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.780
 for packages like minecraft travel 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.370
 xbox or playstation later they said 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.680
 that the way to have your own name 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.439
 of user will be in the same way as 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.840
 I started buying it so you can choose it 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:18.509
 they also asked when they would add 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.099
 the ocelots and the fishing poles the 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:22.380
 developers responded that 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:23.910
 they thought adding the ocelots together 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.480
 the wolves in the previous update 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.360
 but since there are no fish or canes 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.010
 they decided to just leave the wolves saw 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.290
 that it would be better to put them when 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.550
 boats are ready and that this is 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.070
 will commission one of the new 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.290
 developers going on with the next 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.890
 question they think adding music to 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:45.140
 minecraft and the answer was yes and 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:47.150
 it would be easy to add it but not the 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.310
 they want to add because even the 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.920
 pc brand players are usually 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.590
 turn it off and it's kind of boring and what 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.240
 looking for is that it suits the game by 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.450
 what they think to do songs in style 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.700
 nintendo 64 that's why they have not 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.590
 added they also asked if 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.540
 will add new modes for the new 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.700
 version like the bubbles or the wizard 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.440
 they answered that it would be a good idea but 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.630
 who want to add the toiletry 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.100
 to be able to add to the weezer and also 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.800
 they want to add the potions first 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:18.110
 to then add the witches and 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.910
 Then they asked when the 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.040
 form of the inventory may be that 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.580
 we have right now it's too bad to catch 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.620
 things 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.660
 johan replied that it would be easier 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.240
 make a better way to trope those 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:31.400
 objects by just dragging them the 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.840
 problem is that some users still 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.030
 they have devices with a 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.010
 is already very small and that would be a little 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.050
 complicated to throw us the 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:41.690
 next question was when I would add 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.699
 on the maps to be able to locate tommaso 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.410
 he replied that he loves the maps but 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:47.330
 that now are not used much among the 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.160
 mangrove players tpc 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.229
 johan added that it would be a good idea to do 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.780
 maps of the caves to make them more 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:55.550
 attractive the next question was was 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.860
 will add fences and slabs 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.870
 stone of the neder johan replied yes 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.090
 that in fact he forgot to add them in 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.710
 the latest version good guys those 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.810
 were all the questions that he considers 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.190
 important some others I do not want them 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.810
 add because they do not have a good 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:12.050
 answer or because in fact not the 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:13.790
 I understood but well, as I said, that's 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.310
 more or less a summary of what happened 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.919
 because even though the structure a 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.630
 hour and a half to 30% of the questions 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:22.639
 they did not have anything to do with the 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.440
 game for example what color are they 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:26.539
 find if team is that you like to 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.700
 have breakfast what dog breed you like 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:30.979
 more what is your favorite vegetable what 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.870
 friends eat and several questions from 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:34.820
 that style the worst of all is that he does 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.470
 they answered him but good guys like 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.970
 I told them this was a summary of 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.380
 livestream that in my opinion 

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.240
 they answered many things 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.250
 presences more than anything were doubts a 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.440
 both ambiguous but the fact is appreciated 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.180
 that have all answered better guys 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.220
 I want to finish the video 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.020

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.640

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.620
 you are bilingual and would be interested 

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.900

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.880
 account equal guys now yes I say goodbye 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.800
 I have nothing more to say last 

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.570
 bis garcía remember to subscribe if it is 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.610

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:08.660
