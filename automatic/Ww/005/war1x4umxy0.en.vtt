from chickenpox
so<00:00:44.280> I'm<00:00:44.430> going<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.640> bring<00:00:44.789> up<00:00:45.030> these

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
so I'm going to bring up these

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.150 
so I'm going to bring up these
conditions<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:45.989> think<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.980> person

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
conditions you think that the person

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.840 
conditions you think that the person
will<00:00:47.520> fall<00:00:47.820> sick<00:00:48.770> okay<00:00:49.770> if<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.340> look<00:00:50.520> at<00:00:50.700> the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
will fall sick okay if you look at the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.260 
will fall sick okay if you look at the
first<00:00:51.090> option<00:00:51.440> she<00:00:52.440> when<00:00:52.920> she<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.489> recovering

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
first option she when she is recovering

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.939 
first option she when she is recovering
from<00:00:54.390> malaria<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.079> means<00:00:55.440> she<00:00:55.620> has<00:00:55.770> already

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
from malaria that means she has already

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.549 
from malaria that means she has already
suffered<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.699> lot<00:00:56.879> from<00:00:57.149> malaria<00:00:57.629> now<00:00:58.230> she<00:00:58.320> is

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
suffered a lot from malaria now she is

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.139 
suffered a lot from malaria now she is
in<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.710> recovering<00:00:59.309> stage<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.850> means<00:00:59.879> she

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
in the recovering stage that means she

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.200 
in the recovering stage that means she
is<00:01:00.270> getting<00:01:00.539> better<00:01:00.870> day<00:01:01.260> by<00:01:01.289> day<00:01:01.579> right<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:03.180> I

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
is getting better day by day right so I

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.549 
is getting better day by day right so I
don't<00:01:03.570> think<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.170> correct<00:01:04.439> option

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
don't think this is the correct option

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.649 
don't think this is the correct option
because<00:01:04.979> she<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.189> getting<00:01:05.369> better<00:01:05.670> here<00:01:06.060> but

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
because she is getting better here but

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.179 
because she is getting better here but
the<00:01:06.750> question<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.200> asking<00:01:07.560> where<00:01:07.799> she<00:01:08.100> will

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
the question is asking where she will

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.899 
the question is asking where she will
fall<00:01:08.490> even<00:01:09.240> more<00:01:09.270> sick<00:01:09.750> next<00:01:10.710> option<00:01:11.070> she<00:01:11.700> has

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
fall even more sick next option she has

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.300 
fall even more sick next option she has
recovered<00:01:12.270> from<00:01:12.659> malaria<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.409> she<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:13.920> taking

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
recovered from malaria and she is taking

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.620 
recovered from malaria and she is taking
care<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.520> someone<00:01:14.909> suffering<00:01:15.509> from

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
care of someone suffering from

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.609 
care of someone suffering from
chickenpox

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
chickenpox

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.440 
chickenpox
so<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.009> this<00:01:17.220> case<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.670> possibility<00:01:18.330> of

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
so in this case the possibility of

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.870 
so in this case the possibility of
falling<00:01:18.750> stick<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.350> more<00:01:19.799> when<00:01:20.340> compared<00:01:20.820> to

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
falling stick is more when compared to

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.179 
falling stick is more when compared to
the<00:01:21.030> first<00:01:21.270> option<00:01:21.780> that's<00:01:21.930> because<00:01:22.350> now<00:01:22.890> even

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
the first option that's because now even

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.429 
the first option that's because now even
though<00:01:23.460> she<00:01:23.520> is<00:01:23.820> recovering<00:01:24.270> she<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.930> getting

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
though she is recovering she is getting

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.800 
though she is recovering she is getting
better<00:01:25.619> day<00:01:26.040> by<00:01:26.070> day<00:01:26.310> but<00:01:26.909> she<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.240> taking<00:01:27.420> care

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
better day by day but she is taking care

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.030 
better day by day but she is taking care
of<00:01:27.869> someone<00:01:28.409> who<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.619> suffering<00:01:28.829> from

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
of someone who is suffering from

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.190 
of someone who is suffering from
chickenpox<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.030> we<00:01:30.210> know<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.509> box<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:31.079> an

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
chickenpox and we know that box is an

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.020 
chickenpox and we know that box is an
infectious<00:01:31.770> disease<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:32.520> means<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.850> can

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
infectious disease that means it can

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.999 
infectious disease that means it can
spread<00:01:33.240> from<00:01:33.570> one<00:01:33.780> person<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:34.229> another<00:01:34.350> so

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
spread from one person to another so

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.710 
spread from one person to another so
there<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.369> possibility<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.119> she<00:01:36.299> might

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
there is a possibility that she might

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.719 
there is a possibility that she might
get<00:01:36.960> infected<00:01:37.140> with<00:01:37.680> chickenpox<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.460> again

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
get infected with chickenpox and again

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:39.550 
get infected with chickenpox and again
fall<00:01:38.939> sick

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
fall sick

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.530 
fall sick
right<00:01:40.560> now<00:01:41.250> let<00:01:41.430> us<00:01:41.460> look<00:01:41.729> at<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.299> third

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
right now let us look at the third

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.710 
right now let us look at the third
option<00:01:43.009> when<00:01:44.009> she<00:01:44.369> is<00:01:44.579> on<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.759> four<00:01:45.119> day<00:01:45.360> fast

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
option when she is on a four day fast

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.139 
option when she is on a four day fast
after<00:01:46.320> recovering<00:01:46.710> from<00:01:46.829> malaria<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.700> is

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
after recovering from malaria and is

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.609 
after recovering from malaria and is
taking<00:01:48.509> here<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.810> someone<00:01:49.200> suffering<00:01:49.380> from

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
taking here of someone suffering from

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.630 
taking here of someone suffering from
chickenpox

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
chickenpox

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.359 
chickenpox
so<00:01:50.970> now<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.149> look<00:01:51.390> at<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:51.840> she<00:01:52.649> herself<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.250> in

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
so now you look at it she herself is in

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.740 
so now you look at it she herself is in
the<00:01:53.460> recovering<00:01:53.939> stage<00:01:54.210> where<00:01:54.509> she<00:01:54.689> is

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
the recovering stage where she is

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.649 
the recovering stage where she is
getting<00:01:54.960> better<00:01:55.140> day<00:01:55.619> by<00:01:55.649> day<00:01:55.890> in<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:57.119> period

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
getting better day by day in that period

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.069 
getting better day by day in that period
she<00:01:57.869> needs<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:59.189> take<00:01:59.399> lot<00:01:59.729> of<00:01:59.939> rest<00:02:00.240> she<00:02:00.899> should

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
she needs to take lot of rest she should

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.679 
she needs to take lot of rest she should
eat<00:02:01.380> well<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:02.310> build<00:02:02.490> her<00:02:02.700> bird<00:02:02.880> immunes

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
eat well to build her bird immunes

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.779 
eat well to build her bird immunes
very<00:02:03.840> well<00:02:04.109> but<00:02:04.350> instead<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.340> what<00:02:05.640> is

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
very well but instead of that what is

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.150 
very well but instead of that what is
she<00:02:05.909> doing<00:02:06.149> she<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.689> on<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.840> four<00:02:07.140> day<00:02:07.319> fast<00:02:07.649> so

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
she doing she is on a four day fast so

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.650 
she doing she is on a four day fast so
four<00:02:08.429> days<00:02:08.610> she<00:02:08.849> is<00:02:08.879> not<00:02:09.090> eating<00:02:09.300> anything

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
four days she is not eating anything

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.160 
four days she is not eating anything
that<00:02:10.289> means<00:02:10.560> her<00:02:11.459> recover<00:02:12.090> lens<00:02:12.420> which<00:02:12.959> was

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
that means her recover lens which was

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.320 
that means her recover lens which was
happening<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.709> her<00:02:13.860> she<00:02:14.190> was<00:02:14.310> recovering<00:02:14.640> that

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
happening to her she was recovering that

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.180 
happening to her she was recovering that
will<00:02:15.599> also<00:02:15.870> get<00:02:16.019> deteriorated<00:02:16.739> because<00:02:16.860> of

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
will also get deteriorated because of

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.580 
will also get deteriorated because of
her<00:02:17.310> four<00:02:17.549> day<00:02:17.670> fast<00:02:17.940> so<00:02:18.599> she<00:02:18.660> will<00:02:19.049> fall<00:02:19.319> sick

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
her four day fast so she will fall sick

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.949 
her four day fast so she will fall sick
because<00:02:19.830> of<00:02:20.129> the<00:02:20.250> four<00:02:20.489> day<00:02:20.640> fast<00:02:20.910> on<00:02:21.269> top<00:02:21.750> of

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
because of the four day fast on top of

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.600 
because of the four day fast on top of
that<00:02:22.140> she<00:02:22.530> is<00:02:22.709> taking<00:02:23.129> care<00:02:23.160> of<00:02:23.340> somebody

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
that she is taking care of somebody

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.220 
that she is taking care of somebody
suffering<00:02:24.180> from<00:02:24.299> chickenpox

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
suffering from chickenpox

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.720 
suffering from chickenpox
so<00:02:25.440> there<00:02:25.590> will<00:02:25.830> be<00:02:25.860> a<00:02:26.010> good<00:02:26.280> amount<00:02:26.610> of

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
so there will be a good amount of

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.550 
so there will be a good amount of
possibility<00:02:27.450> that<00:02:27.599> she<00:02:27.989> will<00:02:28.110> also<00:02:28.260> get

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
possibility that she will also get

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.220 
possibility that she will also get
infected<00:02:28.890> with<00:02:29.160> chickenpox<00:02:29.849> right<00:02:30.330> so<00:02:30.750> third

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
infected with chickenpox right so third

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.170 
infected with chickenpox right so third
scenario<00:02:31.500> is<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:32.010> one<00:02:32.190> where<00:02:32.519> the

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
scenario is the one where the

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.059 
scenario is the one where the
possibility<00:02:33.810> is<00:02:33.870> maximum<00:02:34.560> that<00:02:34.709> she<00:02:34.950> will

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
possibility is maximum that she will

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.920 
possibility is maximum that she will
fall<00:02:35.280> sick<00:02:35.549> firstly<00:02:36.060> because<00:02:36.209> she<00:02:36.450> isn't<00:02:36.629> fast

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
fall sick firstly because she isn't fast

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.610 
fall sick firstly because she isn't fast
so<00:02:37.590> she<00:02:38.280> is<00:02:38.400> not<00:02:38.579> building<00:02:39.000> a<00:02:39.360> her<00:02:39.810> body<00:02:40.319> up

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
so she is not building a her body up

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.920 
so she is not building a her body up
because<00:02:41.160> she<00:02:41.610> has<00:02:41.760> recently<00:02:42.120> suffered<00:02:42.629> from

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
because she has recently suffered from

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.170 
because she has recently suffered from
malaria<00:02:43.349> so<00:02:43.590> she<00:02:43.650> is<00:02:43.799> already<00:02:44.220> they<00:02:44.340> weak<00:02:44.610> she

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
malaria so she is already they weak she

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.850 
malaria so she is already they weak she
should<00:02:45.360> eat<00:02:45.510> more<00:02:45.690> she<00:02:46.200> should<00:02:46.379> eat<00:02:46.590> healthy

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
should eat more she should eat healthy

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.610 
should eat more she should eat healthy
right<00:02:47.610> instead<00:02:48.180> of<00:02:48.299> that<00:02:48.480> she's<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:48.930> fast<00:02:49.140> on

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
right instead of that she's and fast on

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.050 
right instead of that she's and fast on
top<00:02:49.890> of<00:02:50.069> that<00:02:50.220> she<00:02:50.459> is<00:02:50.549> taking<00:02:50.849> care<00:02:50.879> of

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
top of that she is taking care of

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.650 
top of that she is taking care of
somebody<00:02:51.329> with<00:02:51.629> chickenpox<00:02:52.849> so<00:02:53.849> this<00:02:54.209> is<00:02:54.450> the

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
somebody with chickenpox so this is the

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.640 
somebody with chickenpox so this is the
best<00:02:55.140> option<00:02:55.440> right<00:02:56.780> okay<00:02:57.780> let<00:02:58.079> us<00:02:58.230> look<00:02:58.410> at

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
best option right okay let us look at

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.759 
best option right okay let us look at
the<00:02:58.920> next<00:02:59.129> scenario<00:02:59.879> under<00:03:00.269> which<00:03:01.260> of<00:03:01.620> the

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
the next scenario under which of the

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.160 
the next scenario under which of the
following<00:03:01.980> conditions<00:03:02.879> are<00:03:03.060> you<00:03:03.510> most<00:03:03.810> likely

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
following conditions are you most likely

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.879 
following conditions are you most likely
to<00:03:04.379> fall<00:03:04.709> sick<00:03:05.959> first<00:03:06.959> when<00:03:07.319> you<00:03:07.440> are<00:03:07.470> taking

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:07.889 
to fall sick first when you are taking

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:10.699 
to fall sick first when you are taking
examinations<00:03:09.260> second<00:03:10.260> when<00:03:10.470> you<00:03:10.560> have

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
examinations second when you have

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.839 
examinations second when you have
traveled<00:03:11.220> by<00:03:11.370> bus<00:03:11.609> and<00:03:11.819> train<00:03:11.910> for<00:03:12.569> two<00:03:12.870> days

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 
traveled by bus and train for two days

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.309 
traveled by bus and train for two days
third<00:03:14.849> when<00:03:15.150> you<00:03:15.239> friend<00:03:15.540> is<00:03:15.720> suffering<00:03:15.930> from

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
third when you friend is suffering from

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.180 
third when you friend is suffering from
measles<00:03:18.049> okay<00:03:19.049> so<00:03:19.410> in<00:03:19.500> this<00:03:19.620> case<00:03:19.859> the<00:03:20.040> first

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
measles okay so in this case the first

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.339 
measles okay so in this case the first
option<00:03:20.700> obviously<00:03:21.359> when<00:03:21.510> you<00:03:21.630> are<00:03:21.660> taking

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
option obviously when you are taking

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.379 
option obviously when you are taking
examinations<00:03:23.130> you<00:03:23.220> are<00:03:23.370> not<00:03:23.519> really<00:03:23.849> happy

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
examinations you are not really happy

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:25.729 
examinations you are not really happy

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
you are under tension you are under

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.800 
you are under tension you are under
stress<00:03:26.010> how<00:03:26.609> good<00:03:26.940> I<00:03:26.970> will<00:03:27.239> be<00:03:27.359> able<00:03:27.480> to<00:03:27.630> write

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
stress how good I will be able to write

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.720 
stress how good I will be able to write
how<00:03:28.079> much<00:03:28.290> will<00:03:28.470> I<00:03:28.560> score<00:03:28.919> whether<00:03:29.220> I<00:03:29.310> know<00:03:29.519> the

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
how much will I score whether I know the

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.879 
how much will I score whether I know the
answer<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.120> this<00:03:30.239> question<00:03:30.389> or<00:03:30.720> not<00:03:30.859> so<00:03:31.859> you

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
answer to this question or not so you

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:33.890 
answer to this question or not so you
will<00:03:32.099> have<00:03:32.280> that<00:03:32.459> mental<00:03:32.880> pressure<00:03:33.090> but

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
will have that mental pressure but

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.589 
will have that mental pressure but
otherwise<00:03:34.829> you<00:03:35.669> will<00:03:35.819> not<00:03:35.910> fall<00:03:36.329> sick

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
otherwise you will not fall sick

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.809 
otherwise you will not fall sick
immediately<00:03:36.989> right<00:03:37.980> maybe<00:03:38.250> after<00:03:38.579> results

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
immediately right maybe after results

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.750 
immediately right maybe after results
you<00:03:39.000> might<00:03:39.209> be<00:03:39.919> second<00:03:40.919> option<00:03:41.280> when<00:03:41.489> you<00:03:41.609> have

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
you might be second option when you have

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.780 
you might be second option when you have
traveled<00:03:42.299> by<00:03:42.419> bus<00:03:42.660> and<00:03:43.019> train<00:03:43.290> to<00:03:43.590> two<00:03:43.829> days<00:03:44.040> so

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
traveled by bus and train to two days so
