00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.460
The temperate rainforest,
Fine and mysterious,

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.470
It is a biome,
Full of diverse life.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.320
Lots of little creatures,
And also great big ones,

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.850
Filled with old tall trees,
As well as dead things.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.800
Boom-de-yada, boom-de-yada,
boom-de-yada, boom-de-yada,

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.770
Boom-de-yada, boom-de-yada,
boom-de-yada, boom-de-yada.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.810
I love the location,
Along the warm coast lines,

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.940
Backed by mountain peaks,
On either side.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.820
From British Columbia,
Down to Chile,

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.600
Out west to New Zealand,
And southern Australia too.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.560
Boom-de-yada, boom-de-yada,
boom-de-yada, boom-de-yada,

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.680
Boom-de-yada, boom-de-yada,
boom-de-yada, boom-de-yada.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.670
I love the climate,
Lots of rain whenever,

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.310
Two hundred cm of it,
Enough to fill your boots.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.140
I love the temperature,
Because it varies,

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.630
From five to twenty five,
All in Celsius.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.480
Boom-de-yada, boom-de-yada,
boom-de-yada, boom-de-yada,

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.220
Boom-de-yada, boom-de-yada,
boom-de-yada, boom-de-yada.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:26.780
(instrumental break)

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.300
I love the animals,
That stand on four long legs,

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.980
I love the grizzly bears,
I love the swift cougars.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.410
I love the grey wolves,
I love the caribou,

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.490
I love the big brown elk,
As well the big brown deer.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.050
Boom-de-yada, boom-de-yada,
boom-de-yada, boom-de-yada,

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.280
Boom-de-yada, boom-de-yada,
boom-de-yada, boom-de-yada.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.160
I love the animals,
That fly up with wings,

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.500
I love the sharp bald eagle,
I love the nightly bats

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.550
I love the animals,
The ones that stand in water,

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.540
I love the lanky crane.
And don't forget the egret.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.970
Boom-de-yada, boom-de-yada,
boom-de-yada, boom-de-yada,

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:12.260
Boom-de-yada, boom-de-yada,
boom-de-yada, boom-de-yada.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.010
I love the animals,
That eat up dead things,

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.990
Like the millipede,
Converting waste to nutrients.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.300
I love the rodents,
On the forest floor,

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.000
I love the chipmunk,
Eating seeds all day.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.920
Boom-de-yada, boom-de-yada,
boom-de-yada, boom-de-yada,

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.930
Boom-de-yada, boom-de-yada,
boom-de-yada, boom-de-yada.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:53.870
(instrumental break)

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.880
I love the great tall trees,
Like the Douglas fir,

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.500
Which can grow up to,
Over 60 metres.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.010
I love the red cedars,
I love the hemlock trees,

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.350
I love the birch trees,
And don't forget the maple trees.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.360
Boom-de-yada, boom-de-yada,
boom-de-yada, boom-de-yada,

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.760
Boom-de-yada, boom-de-yada,
boom-de-yada, boom-de-yada.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.370
I love the plant life,
So rich and plentiful,

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.030
I love the stinging nettle,
As well as cattail and fireweed.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.490
I love the sleek green ferns,
I love the laurels,

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.870
But don't leave the epiphytes,
The lichens and the mosses.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.610
Boom-de-yada, boom-de-yada,
boom-de-yada, boom-de-yada,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.330
Boom-de-yada, boom-de-yada,
boom-de-yada, boom-de-yada,

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.030
Boom-de-yada, boom-de-yada,
boom-de-yada, boom-de-yada.
