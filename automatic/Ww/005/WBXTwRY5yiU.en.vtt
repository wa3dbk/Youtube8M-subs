00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.009
 hello to all and all those bites 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.230
 to present my 150 species of 2015 from 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.480
 in ycf immediately presentation 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.950
 but before I would like to work again 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.349
 earth that would want me to do 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.139
 like thil videos faq tutorials 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.720
 bonuses that can be several 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.869
 things were going to move swimming and piano 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.869
 she 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.280
 and yes so we end up for the 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.989
 presentation of the 150 species 2015 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.199
 so let's start with the part 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:47.480
 engine it is a single - cylinder 4-stroke 150 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:52.250
 ycf here the engine 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:54.329
 so it's a caelyx type where sp2 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.269
 it is an air cooling 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.659
 with the air box that is here the 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:02.550
 carbu it's a carbun 26 min so on the 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:05.339
 fuel we can see the starter who 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.590
 is here then we'll go to the party 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.320
 cycle so part cycle we will start 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.710
 by drinking and at the level of the wheel 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.479
 back 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.100
 so it's a crown of 45 in the 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.990
 name that is not original it's a 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:21.270
 blue factory that I bought in addition to a 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:26.009
 chain of 420 so I bought too 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:30.000
 in addition and a pinion of 16 inside 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.470
 here so then we'll go to the 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.280
 fork with fork fork 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.709
 telescopic 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:40.649
 I could dimensions I know more too 

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:45.000
 then for the rear shock so 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:46.590
 with triple tees in blue for 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.020
 the rear shock so it's a 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:55.289
 damper 30 330 mm I think so 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.700
 factory kills you 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:00.750
 then me to stay on top 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.690
 wheel level there are hubs read 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:09.300
 excess factory so blue of origin 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:12.959
 hand knew then relay on sb2 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.819
 what binds to other levels of 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.819
 frame so this is a frame this eric pipe 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.590
 perimeter with a box r so yes 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.349
 because on the old 150 balls to 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.000
 Ouattara did not pass the tooth 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.910
 level of water until sp1 it goes 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.080
 very good since the appearance a sp1 pardon 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.450
 sp2 and sp3 then so brakes before and 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.030
 the rear brakes 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:39.170
 hydraulic with a double front brake 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:44.989
 piston is a piston rear brake 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:50.720
 simple arm to signs years so that's 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:54.110
 a single arm in aluminum here is the footrest 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:57.560
 in stainless steel and to finish part cycle 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:02.840
 it's a reserve of 3 8 liters and a 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:05.239
 reserve liter then so what 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:12.230
 I added the pair of four valves 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:15.410
 ycf so that and that of the blue hoses so 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:20.660
 this one is this one a lever of 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:24.079
 blue velocities of the wrists and both 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.989
 notes in blue clutch lever and 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:29.569
 brake lever also so his return 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:32.870
 nabeul that's very useful for them 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:36.260
 falls down the crown that you have 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.750
 already seen with the chain and I believe that 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.440
 I went around 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.810
 so that's the line 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:48.280
 2015 exhaust from the sp2 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:50.060
 the other side, that's the kicker 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.720
 since I could tell you there's no 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.019
 great thing to say 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:57.500
 the brake pedal the candle the filter to 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.790
 oil testifies it for draining for 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:05.180
 the witness drain of forgiveness 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:07.609
 excuse me here I am bah I think I 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.310
 go around at level 150 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:13.850
 I will start it and then after 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:16.120
 Well I think it will be good I rest 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.540
 the camera 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.540
 double 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.670
 he 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:31.360
 and here is the start of the 150th 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:32.649
 did not start too long so at 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.509
 rising and pascal level 

00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:38.050
 choke so tell me my comment that 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:39.819
 governed metro and starter and so here 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.889
 I think that was all for 

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:43.539
 this video and Thursday at a next 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:44.589
 video for maybe the session 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:47.439
 châteauroux yz f 

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:50.889
 and yes so I go ycf round the 4 

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:53.139
 July in Châteauroux with two friends and 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:55.229
 this is good I tell you no more go 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:55.229
 ciao 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.860
