00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
they would all possibly one of them

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.130 
they would all possibly one of them
would<00:02:30.160> not<00:02:30.430> be<00:02:30.670> written<00:02:30.940> from<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.900> major

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
would not be written from the major

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.240 
would not be written from the major
scale<00:02:32.440> it's<00:02:32.920> just<00:02:33.220> so<00:02:33.430> entrenched<00:02:34.000> in<00:02:34.300> us<00:02:35.880> that

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
scale it's just so entrenched in us that

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.130 
scale it's just so entrenched in us that
it's<00:02:39.250> it's<00:02:39.790> what<00:02:40.030> we<00:02:40.180> hear<00:02:40.480> it's<00:02:40.630> how<00:02:40.720> we<00:02:40.780> hear

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
it's it's what we hear it's how we hear

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.670 
it's it's what we hear it's how we hear
music

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
music

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.870 
music
so<00:02:42.060> this<00:02:43.060> major<00:02:43.390> scale<00:02:43.810> is<00:02:44.050> based<00:02:44.920> off<00:02:45.280> of<00:02:45.310> a

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
so this major scale is based off of a

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.970 
so this major scale is based off of a
root<00:02:46.540> note<00:02:46.810> in<00:02:47.140> this<00:02:47.410> case<00:02:47.650> we're<00:02:47.830> going<00:02:47.920> to

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
root note in this case we're going to

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.970 
root note in this case we're going to
say<00:02:48.190> e<00:02:48.750> if<00:02:49.750> you<00:02:49.780> haven't<00:02:50.110> seen<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.350> video<00:02:50.470> on

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
say e if you haven't seen the video on

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.370 
say e if you haven't seen the video on
the<00:02:51.130> notes<00:02:51.340> on<00:02:51.550> the<00:02:51.580> guitar<00:02:52.050> check<00:02:53.050> that<00:02:53.230> out

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
the notes on the guitar check that out

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.810 
the notes on the guitar check that out
on<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.980> on<00:02:54.700> my<00:02:54.880> YouTube<00:02:55.209> page<00:02:56.430> but<00:02:57.430> we're

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
on the on my YouTube page but we're

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.800 
on the on my YouTube page but we're
basing<00:02:58.420> this<00:02:58.510> off<00:02:58.720> the<00:02:58.840> low<00:02:58.989> E<00:02:59.230> and<00:03:00.630> we<00:03:01.630> also

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
basing this off the low E and we also

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.620 
basing this off the low E and we also
need<00:03:02.140> to<00:03:02.170> take<00:03:02.530> into<00:03:03.040> consideration<00:03:03.880> that<00:03:04.120> the

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
need to take into consideration that the

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.569 
need to take into consideration that the
distance<00:03:05.079> between<00:03:05.290> one<00:03:05.739> fret<00:03:06.040> and<00:03:06.130> the<00:03:06.220> next

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
distance between one fret and the next

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.479 
distance between one fret and the next
is<00:03:07.510> called<00:03:07.660> a<00:03:07.780> half<00:03:07.959> step<00:03:08.160> so<00:03:09.160> if<00:03:09.220> you<00:03:09.310> don't

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
is called a half step so if you don't

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:10.199 
is called a half step so if you don't
know<00:03:09.579> that<00:03:09.790> already

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
know that already

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:11.819 
know that already
I'm<00:03:10.420> do<00:03:10.690> a<00:03:10.720> little<00:03:10.870> research<00:03:11.049> you'll<00:03:11.590> keep

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
I'm do a little research you'll keep

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:13.370 
I'm do a little research you'll keep
watching<00:03:12.010> my<00:03:12.250> videos<00:03:12.280> you'll<00:03:12.760> you'll<00:03:13.120> you'll

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
watching my videos you'll you'll you'll

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.470 
watching my videos you'll you'll you'll
learn<00:03:14.380> more<00:03:14.440> about<00:03:14.650> this<00:03:14.980> but<00:03:15.730> we<00:03:15.820> got<00:03:15.850> half

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
learn more about this but we got half

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.120 
learn more about this but we got half
step<00:03:16.900> is<00:03:17.049> the<00:03:17.170> distance<00:03:17.410> between<00:03:17.530> one<00:03:17.890> fret

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
step is the distance between one fret

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.380 
step is the distance between one fret
the<00:03:18.250> next<00:03:18.549> and<00:03:18.700> a<00:03:18.730> whole<00:03:18.880> step<00:03:19.120> is<00:03:19.269> the

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
the next and a whole step is the

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.220 
the next and a whole step is the
distance<00:03:19.780> between<00:03:19.989> two<00:03:20.500> frets<00:03:21.280> so<00:03:22.230> this

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
distance between two frets so this

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.280 
distance between two frets so this
pattern<00:03:23.799> of<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.130> major<00:03:24.340> scale<00:03:24.700> goes<00:03:25.290> whole

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
pattern of the major scale goes whole

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.100 
pattern of the major scale goes whole
step<00:03:26.709> whole<00:03:27.010> step<00:03:27.070> half<00:03:27.549> step<00:03:28.049> whole<00:03:29.049> step

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
step whole step half step whole step

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.880

so<00:03:37.480> we<00:03:37.660> would<00:03:37.780> take<00:03:37.930> any<00:03:38.110> note<00:03:38.350> on<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.829> guitar

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
so we would take any note on the guitar

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.640 
so we would take any note on the guitar
let's<00:03:39.549> take<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:39.970> low<00:03:40.120> E<00:03:40.329> here<00:03:40.660> now<00:03:41.530> we're

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
let's take the low E here now we're

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.460 
let's take the low E here now we're
gonna<00:03:41.739> follow<00:03:41.950> that<00:03:42.250> pattern<00:03:42.489> we're<00:03:42.820> gonna<00:03:42.940> go

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
gonna follow that pattern we're gonna go

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.390 
gonna follow that pattern we're gonna go
whole

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:57.360 

half<00:03:49.260> hole<00:03:55.319> and<00:03:56.319> there's<00:03:56.590> a<00:03:56.739> major<00:03:56.920> scale

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
half hole and there's a major scale

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.729 
half hole and there's a major scale
right<00:04:00.269> your<00:04:01.269> ear<00:04:01.480> says<00:04:01.720> yes<00:04:01.989> I<00:04:02.140> recognize<00:04:02.709> that

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
right your ear says yes I recognize that

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.130 
right your ear says yes I recognize that
that<00:04:03.190> makes<00:04:03.400> sense<00:04:03.519> if<00:04:04.180> I<00:04:04.360> went<00:04:04.569> outside<00:04:04.690> that

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
that makes sense if I went outside that

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.600 
that makes sense if I went outside that
scale<00:04:05.409> you<00:04:05.440> might<00:04:05.680> hear<00:04:05.890> something<00:04:06.129> like<00:04:06.459> this

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
scale you might hear something like this

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:12.149 
scale you might hear something like this
and<00:04:06.879> your<00:04:06.970> ear<00:04:07.150> would<00:04:07.360> hear<00:04:07.599> it<00:04:10.920> do<00:04:11.920> you<00:04:12.040> hear

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:12.159 
and your ear would hear it do you hear

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:14.039 
and your ear would hear it do you hear
that<00:04:12.220> no<00:04:12.549> there<00:04:12.760> was<00:04:12.909> a<00:04:12.940> little<00:04:13.150> sour<00:04:13.420> that's

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
that no there was a little sour that's

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:16.170 
that no there was a little sour that's
because<00:04:14.409> your<00:04:14.620> ears<00:04:14.799> attenuated<00:04:15.730> to<00:04:15.909> this

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
because your ears attenuated to this

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.469 
because your ears attenuated to this
diatonic<00:04:17.049> memory<00:04:17.320> so<00:04:18.070> let's<00:04:18.310> do<00:04:19.150> another<00:04:19.269> one

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
diatonic memory so let's do another one

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:24.210 
diatonic memory so let's do another one
here<00:04:19.600> let's<00:04:20.109> say<00:04:20.229> we<00:04:20.410> take<00:04:20.560> a<00:04:21.960> okay<00:04:23.220> hitting

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
here let's say we take a okay hitting

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.370 
here let's say we take a okay hitting
that<00:04:24.340> a<00:04:24.610> there<00:04:24.970> we'll<00:04:25.810> do<00:04:26.050> the<00:04:26.139> same<00:04:26.320> thing

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
that a there we'll do the same thing

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.860 
that a there we'll do the same thing
we'll<00:04:27.340> do<00:04:27.520> a<00:04:27.729> whole<00:04:27.880> step<00:04:28.150> whole<00:04:28.419> step<00:04:28.479> half

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
we'll do a whole step whole step half

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:40.010 
we'll do a whole step whole step half
step<00:04:28.930> whole<00:04:29.199> whole<00:04:29.800> half<00:04:30.220> so<00:04:30.520> here<00:04:30.669> we<00:04:30.760> go

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:46.800 

thanks<00:04:41.020> I<00:04:41.080> got<00:04:41.470> a<00:04:41.740> major<00:04:42.280> step<00:04:45.419> now<00:04:46.419> of<00:04:46.600> course

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
thanks I got a major step now of course

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.540 
thanks I got a major step now of course
that<00:04:47.080> gets<00:04:47.199> a<00:04:47.350> little<00:04:47.500> awkward<00:04:47.710> playing<00:04:48.310> the

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
that gets a little awkward playing the

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.190 
that gets a little awkward playing the
linearly<00:04:49.060> on<00:04:49.510> the<00:04:49.960> guitar<00:04:50.289> so<00:04:51.840> it's<00:04:52.840> helpful

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
linearly on the guitar so it's helpful

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.500 
linearly on the guitar so it's helpful
to<00:04:53.349> be<00:04:53.470> able<00:04:53.590> to<00:04:53.710> play<00:04:53.950> across<00:04:54.490> the<00:04:54.729> strings<00:04:55.060> so

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
to be able to play across the strings so

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.850 
to be able to play across the strings so
we<00:04:55.599> can<00:04:55.720> take<00:04:55.870> that<00:04:55.990> same<00:04:56.050> scale<00:04:58.560> we<00:04:59.560> play<00:04:59.800> it

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
we can take that same scale we play it

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.989 
we can take that same scale we play it
across<00:05:00.130> this

00:05:03.989 --> 00:05:03.999 

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:10.439 

we<00:05:04.999> wanted<00:05:05.240> to<00:05:05.300> do<00:05:05.419> two<00:05:05.659> octaves<00:05:06.139> we

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:10.449 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:13.019 

okay<00:05:10.569> so<00:05:11.229> we've<00:05:11.979> got<00:05:12.009> these<00:05:12.309> positives<00:05:12.909> that

00:05:13.019 --> 00:05:13.029 
okay so we've got these positives that

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:14.760 
okay so we've got these positives that
we<00:05:13.150> can<00:05:13.300> learn<00:05:13.419> great<00:05:13.930> thing<00:05:14.169> about<00:05:14.289> them<00:05:14.620> is

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
we can learn great thing about them is

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.980 
we can learn great thing about them is
is<00:05:14.949> that<00:05:15.340> they're<00:05:15.490> movable<00:05:15.879> so<00:05:16.300> we<00:05:16.479> learn<00:05:16.659> a

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
is that they're movable so we learn a

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.510 
is that they're movable so we learn a
major<00:05:19.469> we<00:05:20.469> went<00:05:20.680> to<00:05:20.800> play<00:05:21.009> it<00:05:21.129> up<00:05:21.189> a<00:05:21.309> whole-step

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
major we went to play it up a whole-step

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.360 
major we went to play it up a whole-step
in<00:05:21.909> b<00:05:24.360> then<00:05:25.360> we<00:05:25.479> got<00:05:25.629> it<00:05:25.749> right<00:05:25.930> there<00:05:26.110> okay<00:05:26.860> so

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
in b then we got it right there okay so

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.989 
in b then we got it right there okay so
it's<00:05:27.490> as<00:05:27.610> easy<00:05:27.849> as<00:05:28.059> that<00:05:28.150> now<00:05:29.520> if<00:05:30.520> some<00:05:30.789> of<00:05:30.879> this

00:05:30.989 --> 00:05:30.999 
it's as easy as that now if some of this

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:32.999 
it's as easy as that now if some of this
doesn't<00:05:31.360> make<00:05:31.449> sense<00:05:31.509> to<00:05:32.020> you<00:05:32.199> I<00:05:32.469> actually

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:33.009 
doesn't make sense to you I actually

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:35.820 
doesn't make sense to you I actually
have<00:05:33.669> the<00:05:33.969> patterns<00:05:34.479> for<00:05:35.080> these<00:05:35.349> scales

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
have the patterns for these scales

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.249 
have the patterns for these scales
written<00:05:36.669> out<00:05:36.819> so<00:05:36.849> that<00:05:37.389> if<00:05:37.629> you're<00:05:37.809> in<00:05:37.870> a<00:05:37.990> song

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:38.259 
written out so that if you're in a song

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:45.690 
written out so that if you're in a song
that's<00:05:38.559> insane<00:05:38.949> the<00:05:39.129> key<00:05:39.279> of<00:05:39.400> G<00:05:40.499> you<00:05:41.499> can<00:05:41.710> play

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.460 

using<00:05:46.700> your<00:05:46.880> G<00:05:47.180> major<00:05:47.210> scale<00:05:47.810> for<00:05:48.110> instance

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
using your G major scale for instance

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.560 
using your G major scale for instance
and<00:05:49.310> it<00:05:49.520> would<00:05:49.640> sound<00:05:49.820> Pleasant<00:05:50.390> it<00:05:50.480> would

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 
and it would sound Pleasant it would

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.190 
and it would sound Pleasant it would
sound<00:05:50.720> harmonic<00:05:51.520> so<00:05:52.520> I've<00:05:52.670> got<00:05:52.910> those<00:05:53.200> scales

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:54.200 
sound harmonic so I've got those scales

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.750 
sound harmonic so I've got those scales
in<00:05:55.030> the<00:05:56.500> e-book<00:05:57.500> that<00:05:58.070> you<00:05:58.130> can<00:05:58.340> find<00:05:58.550> that
