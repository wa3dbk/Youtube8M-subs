something<00:00:02.070> out<00:00:02.399> on<00:00:02.790> the<00:00:03.210> JPL<00:00:04.020> orbital

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950

for<00:00:35.489> not<00:00:35.610> downloading<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.270> then<00:00:36.480> but<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.719> didn't

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
for not downloading it then but I didn't

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.930 
for not downloading it then but I didn't
hear<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.719> 28<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:40.250> September<00:00:42.170> back<00:00:43.170> then

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
hear it is 28 of September back then

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.830 
hear it is 28 of September back then
they<00:00:44.940> had<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:46.370> earth<00:00:47.370> distance<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.360> Ellen<00:00:48.660> in

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
they had the earth distance of Ellen in

they had the earth distance of Ellen in
at<00:00:50.989> 0.009<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.649> use<00:00:53.160> from<00:00:53.550> Earth<00:00:54.050> today<00:00:55.050> if<00:00:55.530> you

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
at 0.009 a use from Earth today if you

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.920 
at 0.009 a use from Earth today if you
look<00:00:55.860> at<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.100> JPL<00:00:56.699> for<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.480> same<00:00:57.719> date

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
look at the JPL for the same date

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.070 
look at the JPL for the same date
September<00:00:58.500> 28<00:00:59.180> earth<00:01:00.180> distance<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.309> 0.36<00:01:02.309> 5

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
September 28 earth distance is 0.36 5

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.899 
September 28 earth distance is 0.36 5
hmm<00:01:04.280> that's<00:01:05.280> strange<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:06.240> nASA<00:01:06.450> has<00:01:06.630> been

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
hmm that's strange so nASA has been

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.219 
hmm that's strange so nASA has been
updating<00:01:08.909> or<00:01:09.030> revising<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:09.840> thing<00:01:10.080> but

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
updating or revising this thing but

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.539 
updating or revising this thing but
that's<00:01:10.409> not<00:01:10.560> really<00:01:10.770> what<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.040> wanted<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.400> bring

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
that's not really what I wanted to bring

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.149 
that's not really what I wanted to bring
your<00:01:11.729> attention<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.689> want<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.920> look

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
your attention to I want you to look

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.660 
your attention to I want you to look
let's<00:01:14.790> go<00:01:15.150> back<00:01:15.479> to

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.910 

go<00:01:20.270> back<00:01:20.420> to<00:01:20.600> today's<00:01:20.750> date<00:01:21.970> 14<00:01:23.619> now<00:01:24.619> if<00:01:24.799> you

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
go back to today's date 14 now if you

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.410 
go back to today's date 14 now if you
read<00:01:25.159> the<00:01:25.310> articles<00:01:25.670> on<00:01:25.790> Ellen<00:01:26.030> in<00:01:26.180> and<00:01:26.299> watch

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
read the articles on Ellen in and watch

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.999 
read the articles on Ellen in and watch
some<00:01:26.659> of<00:01:26.689> the<00:01:26.780> other<00:01:26.990> videos<00:01:27.380> a<00:01:27.409> lot<00:01:27.710> of<00:01:27.920> these

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
some of the other videos a lot of these

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:29.620 
some of the other videos a lot of these
people<00:01:28.369> are<00:01:28.460> saying<00:01:28.729> that<00:01:28.909> Elenin<00:01:29.450> is

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
people are saying that Elenin is

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.960 
people are saying that Elenin is
supposed<00:01:30.470> to<00:01:30.680> speed<00:01:31.100> up<00:01:31.250> as<00:01:31.430> it<00:01:31.580> gets<00:01:31.729> closer

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
supposed to speed up as it gets closer

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.940 
supposed to speed up as it gets closer
to<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:32.390> earth<00:01:32.509> it's<00:01:32.899> supposed<00:01:33.080> to<00:01:33.290> speed<00:01:33.740> up

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
to the earth it's supposed to speed up

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.620 
to the earth it's supposed to speed up
and<00:01:35.830> really<00:01:36.830> increase<00:01:37.130> velocity<00:01:37.610> as<00:01:38.299> it<00:01:38.479> gets

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
and really increase velocity as it gets

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.789 
and really increase velocity as it gets
closer<00:01:38.869> to<00:01:39.110> the<00:01:39.229> Sun<00:01:39.500> so<00:01:39.830> it<00:01:40.130> has<00:01:40.340> enough

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
closer to the Sun so it has enough

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.440 
closer to the Sun so it has enough
inertia<00:01:42.799> to<00:01:43.039> whip<00:01:43.520> itself<00:01:43.850> around<00:01:44.030> the<00:01:44.149> Sun

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
inertia to whip itself around the Sun

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.710 
inertia to whip itself around the Sun
and<00:01:44.479> back<00:01:45.380> out<00:01:45.619> back<00:01:46.280> out<00:01:46.490> of<00:01:46.549> our<00:01:46.789> orbit<00:01:47.600> of

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
and back out back out of our orbit of

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.389 
and back out back out of our orbit of
our<00:01:47.930> solar<00:01:48.229> system<00:01:48.710> but<00:01:48.830> I<00:01:48.860> want<00:01:49.039> you<00:01:49.130> to<00:01:49.220> watch

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
our solar system but I want you to watch

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.550 
our solar system but I want you to watch
something<00:01:49.759> here<00:01:52.300> okay<00:01:53.300> you<00:01:53.600> see<00:01:53.869> it's<00:01:54.170> moving

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
something here okay you see it's moving

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.130 
something here okay you see it's moving
about<00:01:54.800> one<00:01:55.280> of<00:01:55.640> these<00:01:55.909> little<00:01:56.149> squares<00:01:56.569> with

every day click as it approaches the
ecliptic<00:02:02.479> zone<00:02:02.929> here<00:02:03.470> which<00:02:03.770> goes<00:02:04.039> over<00:02:04.340> to

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
ecliptic zone here which goes over to

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.630 
ecliptic zone here which goes over to
the<00:02:04.640> lighter<00:02:04.940> blue<00:02:05.740> now<00:02:06.740> watch<00:02:09.610> according<00:02:10.610> to

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
the lighter blue now watch according to

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.559 
the lighter blue now watch according to
this<00:02:10.970> diagram<00:02:12.819> this<00:02:13.819> thing's<00:02:14.060> not<00:02:14.209> picking<00:02:14.510> up

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
this diagram this thing's not picking up

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.539 
this diagram this thing's not picking up
any<00:02:14.720> speed<00:02:15.019> at<00:02:15.140> all<00:02:17.049> okay<00:02:18.049> it<00:02:18.380> is<00:02:18.739> moving<00:02:19.340> at

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
any speed at all okay it is moving at

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:23.650 
any speed at all okay it is moving at
equal<00:02:20.180> and<00:02:20.709> incremental<00:02:21.709> units<00:02:22.209> both<00:02:23.209> below

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
equal and incremental units both below

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.199 
equal and incremental units both below
and<00:02:23.959> above<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.829> ecliptic<00:02:25.579> plane<00:02:27.340> so<00:02:28.340> what

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
and above the ecliptic plane so what

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.509 
and above the ecliptic plane so what
that<00:02:29.239> says<00:02:29.600> to<00:02:29.630> me<00:02:29.780> is<00:02:30.170> that<00:02:30.350> JPL<00:02:30.799> has<00:02:31.010> not<00:02:31.220> made

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
that says to me is that JPL has not made

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.050 
that says to me is that JPL has not made
an<00:02:31.910> adjustment<00:02:32.150> to<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.500> orbital<00:02:33.980> diagram<00:02:34.519> for

the velocity change in Elenin once it

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.259 
the velocity change in Elenin once it
breaks<00:02:38.630> this<00:02:39.320> point<00:02:39.709> right<00:02:40.010> here<00:02:40.070> or<00:02:40.670> as<00:02:41.000> it

breaks this point right here or as it
gets<00:02:41.420> closer<00:02:41.660> from<00:02:41.959> here<00:02:42.200> to<00:02:42.320> here<00:02:43.000> from<00:02:44.019> Sun

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
gets closer from here to here from Sun

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.470 
gets closer from here to here from Sun
distance<00:02:45.500> there<00:02:46.340> are<00:02:46.370> my<00:02:46.549> earth<00:02:46.730> distance<00:02:47.209> but

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
distance there are my earth distance but

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.949 
distance there are my earth distance but
distance<00:02:47.810> from<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:48.109> Sun<00:02:48.320> it's<00:02:48.620> supposed<00:02:48.859> to

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
distance from the Sun it's supposed to

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.319 
distance from the Sun it's supposed to
significantly<00:02:50.959> increase<00:02:51.730> its<00:02:52.730> speed<00:02:52.880> but

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
significantly increase its speed but

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:58.180 
significantly increase its speed but
based<00:02:53.989> on<00:02:54.350> this<00:02:54.799> orbital<00:02:55.640> diagram<00:02:56.239> here<00:02:57.190> it's

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
based on this orbital diagram here it's

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.210 
based on this orbital diagram here it's
not<00:02:58.430> doing<00:02:58.760> anything<00:02:59.030> of<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.870> sort<00:03:00.290> so<00:03:00.980> I'm

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
not doing anything of the sort so I'm

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.800 
not doing anything of the sort so I'm
wondering

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.479 

where<00:03:05.470> is<00:03:05.770> elhanan<00:03:06.690> or<00:03:07.690> Nibiru<00:03:08.260> or<00:03:08.830> whatever

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
where is elhanan or Nibiru or whatever

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.120 
where is elhanan or Nibiru or whatever
you<00:03:09.610> want<00:03:09.760> to<00:03:09.819> call<00:03:09.970> it<00:03:10.470> going<00:03:11.470> to<00:03:11.530> be<00:03:11.650> at<00:03:11.950> any

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
you want to call it going to be at any

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.800 
you want to call it going to be at any
