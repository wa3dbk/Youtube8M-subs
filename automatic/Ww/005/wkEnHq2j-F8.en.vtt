00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
Trevor's own suggestion and looking back

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.170 
Trevor's own suggestion and looking back
I<00:01:58.140> think<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:59.070> was<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.490> touch<00:01:59.850> of<00:02:00.000> genius

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
I think it was a touch of genius

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.810 
I think it was a touch of genius
actually<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.960> was<00:02:01.079> inspired<00:02:01.500> because<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.100> kind

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
actually it was inspired because it kind

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.139 
actually it was inspired because it kind
of<00:02:02.969> said<00:02:03.649> everything<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:04.920> glr<00:02:05.670> wanted<00:02:06.060> to

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
of said everything that glr wanted to

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.839 
of said everything that glr wanted to
say<00:02:06.799> the<00:02:07.799> thing<00:02:07.950> that<00:02:08.069> amazed<00:02:08.340> me<00:02:08.459> that

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
say the thing that amazed me that

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:09.830 
say the thing that amazed me that
doesn't<00:02:09.060> seem<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.360> him<00:02:09.479> with<00:02:09.569> radio<00:02:09.780> stations

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
doesn't seem to him with radio stations

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.900 
doesn't seem to him with radio stations
is<00:02:10.170> that<00:02:10.379> they<00:02:10.530> they<00:02:11.160> seem<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.459> have<00:02:11.520> worked<00:02:11.670> it

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
is that they they seem to have worked it

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.330 
is that they they seem to have worked it
out<00:02:12.030> beforehand<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:12.959> it<00:02:13.050> seemed

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
out beforehand and it seemed

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.850 
out beforehand and it seemed
to<00:02:13.400> stay<00:02:13.670> pretty<00:02:13.940> much<00:02:14.150> on<00:02:14.510> that<00:02:15.230> form<00:02:15.560> was<00:02:15.739> it

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
to stay pretty much on that form was it

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.110 
to stay pretty much on that form was it
was<00:02:15.980> it<00:02:16.099> all<00:02:16.220> very<00:02:16.459> carefully<00:02:16.489> thought<00:02:16.940> out

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
was it all very carefully thought out

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.170 
was it all very carefully thought out
and<00:02:17.269> planned<00:02:17.450> I<00:02:17.840> think<00:02:18.590> it<00:02:18.709> was<00:02:18.860> hugely<00:02:19.760> well

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
and planned I think it was hugely well

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.559 
and planned I think it was hugely well
thought<00:02:20.599> out<00:02:20.629> I<00:02:21.410> think<00:02:22.340> Matthew<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:23.209> Trevor

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
thought out I think Matthew and Trevor

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.390 
thought out I think Matthew and Trevor
between<00:02:24.170> them<00:02:24.440> had<00:02:24.650> obviously<00:02:25.010> got<00:02:25.250> this

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
between them had obviously got this

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.430 
between them had obviously got this
blueprint<00:02:25.970> of<00:02:26.209> what<00:02:26.480> they<00:02:26.720> wanted<00:02:27.200> they

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
blueprint of what they wanted they

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.830 
blueprint of what they wanted they
wanted<00:02:27.849> intelligent<00:02:28.849> speech<00:02:29.209> they<00:02:29.510> wanted

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
wanted intelligent speech they wanted

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.780 
wanted intelligent speech they wanted
smart<00:02:30.830> witty<00:02:32.140> presenters<00:02:33.140> and<00:02:33.500> they<00:02:34.010> wanted<00:02:34.519> a

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
smart witty presenters and they wanted a

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.440 
smart witty presenters and they wanted a
really<00:02:35.620> good<00:02:36.620> strong<00:02:37.489> playlist<00:02:38.150> then<00:02:38.330> I'd

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
really good strong playlist then I'd

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.650 
really good strong playlist then I'd
never<00:02:38.720> worked<00:02:39.080> at<00:02:39.709> a<00:02:40.280> BBC<00:02:40.760> local<00:02:41.420> radio

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
never worked at a BBC local radio

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.780 
never worked at a BBC local radio
station<00:02:42.349> where<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.620> music<00:02:43.069> was<00:02:43.220> so<00:02:43.370> important

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
station where the music was so important

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.190 
station where the music was so important
and<00:02:43.849> it<00:02:43.940> was<00:02:44.030> clear<00:02:44.360> that<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.629> music<00:02:45.049> was

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
and it was clear that the music was

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.130 
and it was clear that the music was
going<00:02:45.410> to<00:02:45.560> be<00:02:45.680> such<00:02:46.069> an<00:02:46.760> important<00:02:47.390> part<00:02:47.569> I

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
going to be such an important part I

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.050 
going to be such an important part I
mean<00:02:48.410> I<00:02:48.530> I<00:02:48.860> was<00:02:49.190> used<00:02:49.400> to<00:02:49.489> scrambling<00:02:49.940> around

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
mean I I was used to scrambling around

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.030 
mean I I was used to scrambling around
in<00:02:50.360> the<00:02:50.420> library<00:02:50.810> looking<00:02:50.900> for<00:02:51.260> Neil<00:02:51.590> Sedaka

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040

an<00:02:52.400> on<00:02:52.640> needle<00:02:53.060> time<00:02:53.239> so<00:02:53.599> for<00:02:53.810> me<00:02:53.959> it<00:02:54.530> was<00:02:54.650> just

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
an on needle time so for me it was just

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.100 
an on needle time so for me it was just
a<00:02:54.980> revelation<00:02:55.370> and<00:02:56.060> I<00:02:56.120> think<00:02:56.480> they<00:02:56.660> had<00:02:56.900> this

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
a revelation and I think they had this

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.309 
a revelation and I think they had this
plan<00:02:57.440> and<00:02:57.769> like<00:02:58.280> two<00:02:58.660> military<00:02:59.660> generals<00:03:00.140> they

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
plan and like two military generals they

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.100 
plan and like two military generals they
just<00:03:00.530> went<00:03:00.980> for<00:03:01.220> it<00:03:01.459> and<00:03:01.780> what<00:03:02.780> would<00:03:02.870> you<00:03:02.959> say

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
just went for it and what would you say

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.660 
just went for it and what would you say
about<00:03:03.140> the<00:03:03.349> legacy<00:03:03.680> of<00:03:03.890> GL<00:03:04.129> oh<00:03:04.220> what's<00:03:04.459> it<00:03:04.579> done

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
about the legacy of GL oh what's it done

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:05.800 
about the legacy of GL oh what's it done

I<00:03:06.370> think<00:03:07.370> DLR<00:03:07.790> is<00:03:07.879> important<00:03:08.390> because<00:03:08.590> it<00:03:09.590> made

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
I think DLR is important because it made

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.930 
I think DLR is important because it made
made<00:03:11.569> people<00:03:12.410> realize<00:03:12.620> that<00:03:13.280> there<00:03:13.549> was<00:03:13.879> a

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
made people realize that there was a

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.860 
made people realize that there was a
space<00:03:14.390> for<00:03:14.690> this<00:03:14.780> kind<00:03:15.110> of<00:03:15.230> AOR<00:03:16.870> intelligent

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
space for this kind of AOR intelligent

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.009 
space for this kind of AOR intelligent
speech<00:03:18.290> based<00:03:18.940> programming<00:03:19.940> and<00:03:20.209> and<00:03:20.480> I<00:03:20.600> don't

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
speech based programming and and I don't

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.349 
speech based programming and and I don't
think<00:03:21.260> there<00:03:21.560> was<00:03:21.650> anything<00:03:21.859> to<00:03:22.250> rival<00:03:23.150> it<00:03:23.209> at

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
think there was anything to rival it at

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:26.590 
think there was anything to rival it at
the<00:03:23.450> time<00:03:23.690> and<00:03:24.170> now<00:03:24.489> you<00:03:25.489> know<00:03:25.609> you<00:03:25.880> see<00:03:26.299> a<00:03:26.329> lot

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
the time and now you know you see a lot

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.349 
the time and now you know you see a lot
of<00:03:27.220> copycat<00:03:28.220> stations<00:03:28.730> I<00:03:28.849> suppose<00:03:29.120> in<00:03:29.269> a<00:03:29.329> way

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
of copycat stations I suppose in a way

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:31.059 
of copycat stations I suppose in a way
people<00:03:29.510> who<00:03:29.989> realize<00:03:30.440> that<00:03:30.470> that<00:03:30.799> is<00:03:30.859> a

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
people who realize that that is a

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.099 
people who realize that that is a
mixture<00:03:31.579> that<00:03:31.849> a<00:03:31.910> lot<00:03:32.209> of<00:03:32.239> people<00:03:32.780> of<00:03:32.989> a

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
mixture that a lot of people of a

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.549 
mixture that a lot of people of a
certain<00:03:33.290> age<00:03:33.560> want<00:03:34.130> to<00:03:34.250> listen<00:03:34.430> to
