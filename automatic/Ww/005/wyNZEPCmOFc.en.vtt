00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
increase the discharge of urine and of

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.340 
increase the discharge of urine and of
course<00:00:38.190> this<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.610> an<00:00:38.879> issue<00:00:39.120> if<00:00:39.600> we<00:00:39.930> are<00:00:40.079> having

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
course this is an issue if we are having

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.639 
course this is an issue if we are having
caffeine<00:00:40.920> before<00:00:41.520> an<00:00:42.030> exam<00:00:42.210> however<00:00:43.200> there<00:00:43.530> is

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
caffeine before an exam however there is

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.190 
caffeine before an exam however there is
a<00:00:43.680> way<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.129> counteract<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.210> diuretic<00:00:45.780> effects

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
a way to counteract the diuretic effects

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.799 
a way to counteract the diuretic effects
of<00:00:46.410> caffeine<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:47.039> sodium<00:00:47.730> load<00:00:48.059> increases

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
of caffeine a sodium load increases

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.889 
of caffeine a sodium load increases
blood<00:00:49.260> auth<00:00:49.590> molarity<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.550> this<00:00:51.120> leads<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.780> an

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
blood auth molarity and this leads to an

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.350 
blood auth molarity and this leads to an
increase<00:00:52.440> in<00:00:52.649> water<00:00:53.190> reabsorption<00:00:53.670> and

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
increase in water reabsorption and

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.319 
increase in water reabsorption and
retention<00:00:54.780> in<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.340> nephrons<00:00:56.340> as<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.670> result

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
retention in the nephrons as a result

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.529 
retention in the nephrons as a result
urine<00:00:58.020> production<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.829> decreased<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.760> this

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
urine production is decreased and this

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.869 
urine production is decreased and this
as<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> result<00:01:01.320> should<00:01:01.739> help<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.609> get

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
as a result should help you to get

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.579 
as a result should help you to get
through<00:01:03.090> your<00:01:03.270> exam<00:01:03.539> without<00:01:03.750> needing<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.439> go

through your exam without needing to go

to the washroom for the sodium load 400

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.800 
to the washroom for the sodium load 400
to<00:01:07.380> 600<00:01:07.680> milligrams<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.549> sodium<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:09.270> enough

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
to 600 milligrams of sodium is enough

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.710 
to 600 milligrams of sodium is enough

microwavable dinner before the exam as
that<00:01:18.420> not<00:01:18.869> only<00:01:19.049> gives<00:01:19.200> me<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.650> sodium<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.220> I

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
that not only gives me the sodium that I

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.730 
that not only gives me the sodium that I
need<00:01:20.580> but<00:01:20.880> also<00:01:21.060> other<00:01:21.540> nutrients<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.380> provide
