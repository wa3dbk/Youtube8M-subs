00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
wheels been after my second ride I

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.219 
wheels been after my second ride I
noticed<00:01:34.000> that<00:01:34.090> the<00:01:34.180> rear<00:01:34.360> wheel<00:01:34.390> hasn't<00:01:34.990> play

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
noticed that the rear wheel hasn't play

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.069 
noticed that the rear wheel hasn't play
in<00:01:35.290> it<00:01:35.470> so<00:01:36.009> I<00:01:36.040> snug<00:01:36.490> up<00:01:36.670> the<00:01:36.700> preload<00:01:37.270> and<00:01:37.509> got

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 
in it so I snug up the preload and got

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:39.780 
in it so I snug up the preload and got
rid<00:01:38.259> of<00:01:38.290> the<00:01:38.409> play<00:01:38.680> and<00:01:39.009> the<00:01:39.460> wheel<00:01:39.610> could

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
rid of the play and the wheel could

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.730 
rid of the play and the wheel could
still<00:01:40.060> spin<00:01:40.329> freely<00:01:40.630> and<00:01:40.990> since<00:01:41.350> then<00:01:41.560> it's

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
still spin freely and since then it's

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.580 
still spin freely and since then it's
not<00:01:41.979> needed<00:01:42.340> any<00:01:42.490> adjustment<00:01:43.060> at<00:01:43.119> all<00:01:43.590> the
