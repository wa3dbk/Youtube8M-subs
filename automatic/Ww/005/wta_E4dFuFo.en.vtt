00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.330
 today we have a guest for my luck 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.010

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.929
 away from here from spain to see if 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.550

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.970

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.970

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:30.710

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.710
 watch and the colony ana 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:40.020
 could not come more provocative not for 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.180
 I can not cook so we're going to 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.370
 cook then let's consider a soup 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.150
 that of beet that in Polish is called 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.020
 patch 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.640
 it is a soup that is eaten not good in 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.640
 some parts of poland in my house for 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.519
 example prepare this is already a good 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.500
 happy recipe for Christmas good 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:03.140
 if I brought one of the things that we 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.140
 this may be missing for the recipe 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.350
 we already have laurel 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.350
 I have no idea 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.020
 we have a laurel to see if they are laurel 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.350
 special 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.340
 they will not sign it 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.340
 granier 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.500
 what is it that they want is a pepper 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.800
 It seems 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.920
 good we start with the soup 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.170
 Well first we have to boil 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.550
 all these little things in very good water 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.270
 with some laurel angeli with a 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:42.780
 little pepper 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.780
 then we place celery if it has order 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.930
 I have one thing that I was told that the 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.350
 breakfast in poland if it's true 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.350
 3 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.070
 cut carrot 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.370
 and the apple you get to cut the apple 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.370
 in 4 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.040
 cook at home you 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:21.040
 is not a cook at home look 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:23.900
 good idea good if to relax 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:29.250
 especially what will be 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.990
 with some water how much water then for 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.990
 cover the same you've seen it at least 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.890
 sometimes your mother do the jack if 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.890
 call me to season 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.500
 the more more the more because this is the 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.350
 base for the soup though 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.220
 we put it to boil there it's fine more 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.970
 more more 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.840
 the water that is free grows 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.840
 I'm hungry 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:02.489
 you have to add this afterwards already and a 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:05.849
 little leaf or two of these 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.849
 twice 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:13.000
 when it's good we let it cook 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:19.980
 now how many 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.980
 to the paper edition 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:28.710
 pretty can be called relaxed anita 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.400
 well now let's place the beet 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.400
 not here 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.920
 but 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.630
 cult that reaches enough there is 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.810
 important this because it will give the color 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:46.360
 manna and flavor I love yes sure 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.770
 I think it's enough 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.730
 we have the ravioli here we are going to 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:54.040
 cooking beets problems that was 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.790
 all red ravioli accepts the forest in 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.790
 of coal we made 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.360
 I like to dance I like 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:20.959
 in these minutes when it goes up soon to 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:25.450
 this one minute list the right time 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.450
 to teach tango dance and so on 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:46.170
 in the sales stand 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:48.249
 applause and a question we are going to strain 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.409
 now 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:52.480
 all 7 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:54.160
 to see if I burn you 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.370
 We will have insurance for burns or for 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.370
 you 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:03.019
 and now we are going to use only the broth 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:04.869
 if it just decays and this leads to all the 

00:05:03.019 --> 00:05:08.029
 not good garbage this can be used 

00:05:04.869 --> 00:05:09.679
 some things to make a salad 

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:11.419
 I think the food is not always culture 

00:05:09.679 --> 00:05:13.789
 one learns through food a 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:16.869
 little the customs of the people everything what 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:19.190
 I'm going to save, I'm going to make a 

00:05:16.869 --> 00:05:20.840
 Polish salad 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.110
 I have what is mine we are going to serve the 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.110

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:36.690

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.530
 and now we try 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:06:00.159
 what would have to add many things to the 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.159
 sugar 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:07.520

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:48.570
 the mushroom ravioli 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.570
 they are fantastic 

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:57.030

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:59.430
