so just keep going keep jumpshot and one
thing<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.710> keep<00:01:28.829> in<00:01:28.979> mind<00:01:29.039> is<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.399> the<00:01:29.579> guy

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
thing to keep in mind is that the guy

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.419

00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:32.429 
slows down when he's low health so you

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:35.179 
slows down when he's low health so you
