00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:17.240
 Hello everyone, today we show you 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:20.189
 how we made these kennels 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.810
 so with the help of a building lion of mi 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.779
 do you need to see right away 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.340
 we have recovered a pallet that 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.340
 It should be my pallets and 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:38.370
 we have already removed the nails and 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:40.860
 so let's remove all and all 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.980
 the sheets of memo of the pallet 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.590
 as you see we have already traced with 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.860
 a pencil the measurements then of course ve 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:58.379
 I write and now we're going to do 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:01:03.180
 we have cuts with a hacksaw 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:06.180
 just recovered two 50 e strips 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.270
 two strips of 40 and now we will go to 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.960
 smooth and can be done either with paper 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:19.049
 glazed or with a tool one 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:22.500
 sander now we can proceed to 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.830
 apply one or two coats of impregnating agent 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:32.460
 and we will use in binding for external 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:37.560
 then we will need a white base 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:39.030
 it measures 40 x 40 6 and 4 chiellini 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.530
 we have chosen to use gods 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:46.079
 feet 8 cm high once 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.590
 assembled all our little girl 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:53.100
 I will also proceed to pass two hands of 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.280
 the base is also impregnating on the feet 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:00.450
 since we will use in 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:03.030
 external so now we just have to 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.360
 seem to have all positioned the 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.599
 our foot under the base and now 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:13.240
 with a screwdriver and a screw we go to 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:15.920
 fix the two pieces together 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.900
 the same thing we will obviously do for 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.550
 the limbs between the legs and this and how 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.210
 it appears once applied 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.040
 feet 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.680
 let's say you create a kind of 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.980
 table now I'm going to apply the 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:31.820
 four sides that are the ones I have 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:35.690
 recovered from the pallet and will always go to 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.070
 fix with screws and helps the 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.250
 vita tore but of course we can 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:44.750
 also live by hand and here is mine 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:47.180
 kennel assembled now as I have you 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:51.080
 said at the beginning I go to pass a hand 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.750
 impregnating impregnating agent suitable for 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:58.430
 external white and I pass it either 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:01.010
 internally and externally I have 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:05.930
 printed my dog's name on a 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:08.540
 classic sheet and I go now with a 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:13.090
 scalpel and with a cutter ad 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:15.710
 carve all the letters of the name 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.650
 small permitting 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.390
 and here the first letter is cut 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.140
 now I do the same thing for 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.050
 the others 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:27.350
 as you see the inscription I positioned 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:30.740
 I glued it just put a thread 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.270
 light glue for paper in such a way 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.850
 to keep it still 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:39.620
 now with a pretty brush 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:44.800
 old or with a sponge I go to 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.800
 fill with acrylic paint 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.120
 I recommend the interior of the letters 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.290
 obviously when you then make the cut 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:58.370
 remember to take even the 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:04:00.320
 small pieces inside so I proceed to 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.660
 color all the letters when the 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:06.940
 writing has dried I can go 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.940
 slowly remove the stencil 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.680
 and then of course I will also go to remove 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.019
 the central ones with the help of a 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.260
 cutter and here is me now with it 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:27.450
 same procedure I will go to reproduce 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.900
 this paw is also on one side 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.660
 than on the other 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:36.389
 I go to stop and as before I go to 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.650
 insert acrylic paint inside 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:40.200
 of the stencil 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.620
 when the writing is finished I go to apply 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:46.020
 of the colorless protective binding for 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.900
 just protect the writing and must 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.180
 be an impregnating agent suitable for 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.700
 the inside and the outside if you use it 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.410
 obviously externally and as you have 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.020
 seen this the final result 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:01.260
 we have chosen to reuse either 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:04.200
 in reclaimed wood from a pallet like 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.120
 you have seen but also in the other wood 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.300
 obviously they can also be realized 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.979
 only with the use of the bank 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.660
 single 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:15.510
 we also had just another wood of 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.220
 recovery so we chose to 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.840
 make it that way 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.690
 let us know with a comment below 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.780
 what do you think we thank you for 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.229
 having seen the video and see you at 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:30.360
 next one 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:32.810
 hello hello and apparently also like ai 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.810
 cats 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.300
 it's true
