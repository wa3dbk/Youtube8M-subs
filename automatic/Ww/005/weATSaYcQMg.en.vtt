00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 Hello and welcome by the 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.870
 self inspiration and to another 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.790
 wage letters video of me in this 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.630
 video I want to show you how to do that 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.509
 theme 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.389
 that's easy i open it 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.670
 the flower board you put the longboard 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.539
 so that the three next to each other 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.430
 lie 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.800
 just use the tool for that 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.689
 what is with her glory board and 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.130
 pry it apart and then set it 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.640
 just as well together again you needed for 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:37.380
 the 19th 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.520
 bender and your crochet hook of course and 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.379
 then it starts with the 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:50.940
 derivation so i start here on the 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:53.489
 middle position with 20 rubbers that is the 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.210
 lower half of the t is wrong 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.550
 around 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.930
 It is quite practical then 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.399
 I subsequently only take one cap 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.650
 Then I'll get another 2 louis 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:09.900
 work as always with two 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:12.439
 rubber and then from the third to the 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.439
 fourth position 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.660
 and then from the fourth to the fifth 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.400
 as always two rubbers together with it 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:28.700
 I'll go after that 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:32.940
 outside from the fifth middle position 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:36.150
 to the fifth right position and from 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:39.710
 the fifth middle to the fifth 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.710
 left position 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.920
 then come the closures on it 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:52.210
 and just shut up 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:53.860
 I take two rubbers 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.210
 I give another pay-goalie and give 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:00.810
 the 1 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:02.729
 the family I give 12 was loki 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.100
 crochet hook so now a total of three 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.690
 let me take it then I'll take two 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.590
 more rubbers 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:16.450
 and pull this rubber once over the 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:21.540
 two other unis and then I give 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:24.160
 this rubber is double that way 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:28.330
 medium rubber what I gave up 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:31.320
 in the middle is beyond my utmost 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.840
 not worked on mobile phone 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.150
 this acts as an extension and the t 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.740
 the cross strut on top of the t will be something 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:46.390
 I do the same thing here longer 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:48.820
 Take two rubbers and then three 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:53.110
 or two envelopes on the 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:59.040
 crochet hook on it all 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:02.410
 leave and the unbeaten rubbers on 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.090
 give the crochet needle respectively on 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.670
 Of course, it's all down to the 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.490
 flowers i had it on the crochet hook 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:13.110
 so now i have the closure 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:20.110
 on it now I can with flowers 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:23.200
 I start here on the pages of this 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:27.120
 be careful from one side that the 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:32.340
 does not exclude rubbers fall off powder 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:38.410
 and from this side here also poland and 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:40.739
 pass it carefully and then have 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:44.620
 I'm here from the bottom 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:46.150
 the long striving of the teas this here 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.830
 I have to go through the bottom right now 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:53.260
 So get in the pin go in and the 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.300
 of all the bottom two rubber soles i 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.709
 Hope you see it so the kaller 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:03.670
 lowest horn and careful after 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:06.120
 give up in front by giving up front and 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.120
 then quite normal 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:25.330
 rejects it looks the whole now 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:27.580
 praised if you keep it that way 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:31.470
 animal also great and now just a 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.470
 another rubber to close and 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:39.880
 love the whole thing once here 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:45.660
 through her once through herself 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.660
 through and closed the whole thing 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:56.500
 and can not completely do so now 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:00.099
 I prefer the whole thing as always 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:04.080
 bit in the form of the lower part 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:07.180
 Here you just pull here 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.750
 through the t and hiding in like that 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.750
 a little bit 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.660
 because on the side you want the whole 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:18.530
 yes, do not connect with a bracelet 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:20.300
 or a chain or spike so 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:25.010
 Just pull it in a bit 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:27.710
 always and then you take another 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:30.980
 uni and pick a side out of me 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:35.300
 me this time pulls a rubber there 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:39.020
 Just go in and pull it again 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:43.910
 through yourself and then have 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:45.530
 this is a new one for industry 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:49.780
 animal then out of here must be too 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.780
 to be preferred a bit more 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:59.550
 and I hope you like it and then 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:01.260
