00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
galaxy s6 concept here from Danny jayco

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.580 
galaxy s6 concept here from Danny jayco
it<00:00:08.730> so<00:00:09.090> as<00:00:09.389> I<00:00:09.510> said<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.719> galaxy<00:00:09.840> s6<00:00:10.260> we<00:00:10.469> just

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
it so as I said the galaxy s6 we just

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.110 
it so as I said the galaxy s6 we just
got<00:00:10.769> the<00:00:10.860> galaxy<00:00:11.130> s5<00:00:11.340> in<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.670> galaxies<00:00:12.000> far

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
got the galaxy s5 in the galaxies far

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.759 
got the galaxy s5 in the galaxies far
it's<00:00:12.240> going<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.420> come<00:00:12.540> out<00:00:12.719> on<00:00:12.780> april<00:00:13.320> eleventh

it's going to come out on april eleventh

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.849 
it's going to come out on april eleventh
which<00:00:14.700> is<00:00:14.940> around<00:00:15.900> 12<00:00:16.320> days<00:00:16.560> from<00:00:16.800> now

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
which is around 12 days from now

which is around 12 days from now
something<00:00:17.220> I<00:00:17.400> mean<00:00:17.550> we're<00:00:17.699> really<00:00:17.940> really

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
something I mean we're really really

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
so you can see here we have a

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.189 
so you can see here we have a
rectangular<00:00:23.490> design<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:24.330> we<00:00:24.840> all<00:00:24.900> saw<00:00:25.050> some

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
rectangular design and we all saw some

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.439 
rectangular design and we all saw some
pretty<00:00:25.320> interesting<00:00:25.650> stuff<00:00:25.890> here<00:00:26.400> about<00:00:27.029> the

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
pretty interesting stuff here about the

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.330 
pretty interesting stuff here about the
colors<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.019> everything<00:00:28.140> that<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:28.830> totally

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
colors and everything that is totally

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.089 
colors and everything that is totally
redesigned<00:00:30.060> here<00:00:30.539> in<00:00:30.630> this<00:00:30.689> concept<00:00:31.230> would

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
redesigned here in this concept would

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.560 
redesigned here in this concept would
sooo<00:00:32.250> cool<00:00:32.460> but<00:00:32.579> it<00:00:32.730> sounds<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.030> office<00:00:33.390> that

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
sooo cool but it sounds of office that

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.500 
sooo cool but it sounds of office that
it<00:00:33.690> kind<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:33.960> had<00:00:34.200> features<00:00:34.680> some<00:00:35.510> realistic

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
it kind of had features some realistic

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.840 
it kind of had features some realistic
effects<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.380> here<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:37.950> can<00:00:38.070> see<00:00:38.129> next<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.760> the

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
effects and here you can see next to the

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.880 
effects and here you can see next to the
s5<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.570> are<00:00:40.020> going<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.230> do<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.379> separate<00:00:40.710> video

s5 you are going to do a separate video

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.340 
s5 you are going to do a separate video
about<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.370> but<00:00:42.270> yeah<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.570> specs<00:00:42.989> on<00:00:43.230> this

4.5 and 7.2 millimeters in thickness and
then<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.550> can't<00:00:57.059> feel<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.270> takes<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.750> little<00:00:57.899> kind

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
then I can't feel it takes a little kind

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.439 
then I can't feel it takes a little kind
of<00:00:58.350> like<00:00:58.440> an<00:00:58.590> iPhone<00:00:59.039> shape<00:00:59.520> but<00:01:00.030> like<00:01:00.420> a

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
of like an iPhone shape but like a

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.380 
of like an iPhone shape but like a
bigger<00:01:00.660> variant<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.350> 1<00:01:01.890> 28<00:01:02.340> grams<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.149> from

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
bigger variant of it 1 28 grams and from

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.520 
bigger variant of it 1 28 grams and from

its 5-inch display so around inside dal
5<00:01:07.830> inches<00:01:08.130> bigger<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.729> then<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.330> previous<00:01:09.810> a

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
5 inches bigger and then the previous a

5 inches bigger and then the previous a
galaxy<00:01:10.680> s<00:01:10.710> device<00:01:11.340> this<00:01:11.729> or<00:01:12.030> at<00:01:12.210> least<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.479> ass

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
galaxy s device this or at least the ass

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.719 
galaxy s device this or at least the ass
is<00:01:12.780> fine<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:14.040> seems<00:01:14.189> like<00:01:14.369> they're<00:01:14.549> moving

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
is fine and it seems like they're moving

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.940 
is fine and it seems like they're moving
up<00:01:14.939> here<00:01:15.180> in<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:15.600> concept<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.470> 2k<00:01:16.830> display

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
up here in this concept to a 2k display

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.730 
up here in this concept to a 2k display
with<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.670> resolution<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.060> 2560<00:01:18.570> x<00:01:18.720> 1440<00:01:19.170> so

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
with the resolution of 2560 x 1440 so

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.520 
with the resolution of 2560 x 1440 so
the<00:01:20.189> PPI<00:01:20.549> would<00:01:20.939> be<00:01:21.090> pretty<00:01:21.659> pretty<00:01:21.840> high<00:01:22.140> on

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
the PPI would be pretty pretty high on

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.760 
the PPI would be pretty pretty high on
this<00:01:23.340> little<00:01:23.580> device<00:01:24.080> and<00:01:25.080> also<00:01:25.530> some<00:01:25.680> other

year<00:01:54.180> I'm<00:01:54.540> really<00:01:55.020> sure<00:01:55.290> probably<00:01:55.320> going<00:01:55.890> to

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
year I'm really sure probably going to

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.889 
year I'm really sure probably going to
have<00:01:56.070> some<00:01:56.250> better<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.729> in<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.180> year<00:01:57.210> four

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
have some better and in a year four

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.200 
have some better and in a year four
gigabytes<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.469> RAM<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.130> one<00:01:59.340> at<00:01:59.460> magee<00:01:59.759> HD<00:02:00.000> box

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
gigabytes of RAM and one at magee HD box

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.660 
gigabytes of RAM and one at magee HD box
of<00:02:00.329> storage<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.869> also<00:02:01.740> do<00:02:01.979> believe<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.369> story

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
of storage I also do believe that story

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.550 
of storage I also do believe that story
sounds<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.270> little<00:02:03.479> bit<00:02:03.600> overkill<00:02:04.020> Whammer<00:02:04.320> and

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
sounds a little bit overkill Whammer and

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.170 
sounds a little bit overkill Whammer and
20<00:02:04.829> gigabytes<00:02:05.100> maybe<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:05.759> will<00:02:05.850> fully

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
20 gigabytes maybe that will fully

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.960 
20 gigabytes maybe that will fully
finally<00:02:06.930> go<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.049> 32<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:07.829> 64<00:02:08.190> gigabyte<00:02:08.520> parents

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
finally go to 32 and 64 gigabyte parents

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.380 
finally go to 32 and 64 gigabyte parents
and<00:02:09.149> drop<00:02:09.660> off<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.080> 16th<00:02:10.770> burnt<00:02:11.190> at<00:02:11.340> least

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
and drop off the 16th burnt at least

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.570 
and drop off the 16th burnt at least
and<00:02:12.750> then<00:02:12.960> we<00:02:13.110> do<00:02:13.230> have<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.590> rumors<00:02:14.340> about<00:02:14.550> a

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
and then we do have a rumors about a

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.640 
and then we do have a rumors about a
legate<00:02:14.970> in<00:02:15.150> this<00:02:15.420> concept<00:02:15.810> or<00:02:16.050> yeah<00:02:16.470> it's

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
legate in this concept or yeah it's

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.390 
legate in this concept or yeah it's
called<00:02:17.180> 21<00:02:18.180> may<00:02:18.360> pixel<00:02:18.720> camera<00:02:18.959> with<00:02:19.410> f<00:02:19.650> 1.8

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
called 21 may pixel camera with f 1.8

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.460 
called 21 may pixel camera with f 1.8
and<00:02:20.730> also<00:02:21.420> each<00:02:21.660> represent<00:02:22.170> front-facing

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
and also each represent front-facing

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.960 
and also each represent front-facing
camera<00:02:22.920> which<00:02:23.100> probably<00:02:23.370> would<00:02:23.520> be<00:02:23.700> one<00:02:23.880> of

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
camera which probably would be one of

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.199 
camera which probably would be one of
the<00:02:24.060> best<00:02:24.240> but<00:02:24.780> facing<00:02:25.110> cameras<00:02:25.500> ever<00:02:25.740> a<00:02:26.580> 2k

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
the best but facing cameras ever a 2k

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.750 
the best but facing cameras ever a 2k
resolution<00:02:27.330> or<00:02:28.230> in<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.830> recording<00:02:29.280> at<00:02:29.430> 30

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
resolution or in the recording at 30

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.980 
resolution or in the recording at 30
frames<00:02:29.940> per<00:02:30.090> second<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:30.600> more<00:02:30.840> of<00:02:30.930> an

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
frames per second and more of an

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.960 
frames per second and more of an
edge-to-edge<00:02:31.170> display<00:02:31.440> still<00:02:32.370> home<00:02:32.610> button

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
edge-to-edge display still home button

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.370 
edge-to-edge display still home button
down<00:02:33.090> there<00:02:33.240> at<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.390> bottom<00:02:33.450> but<00:02:33.720> very<00:02:33.959> slim

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
down there at the bottom but very slim

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.410 
down there at the bottom but very slim
so<00:02:34.590> it<00:02:34.709> makes<00:02:34.890> an<00:02:35.040> interesting<00:02:35.190> design<00:02:35.640> also

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
so it makes an interesting design also

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.240 
so it makes an interesting design also
seems<00:02:36.720> like<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.110> speaker<00:02:37.350> on<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.590> back<00:02:37.680> is

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
seems like the speaker on the back is

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.090 
seems like the speaker on the back is
way<00:02:38.520> more<00:02:38.700> powerful<00:02:38.910> than<00:02:39.390> ever<00:02:39.540> before<00:02:40.020> so<00:02:40.770> I

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
way more powerful than ever before so I

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.590 
way more powerful than ever before so I
really<00:02:41.340> do<00:02:41.459> enjoy<00:02:41.550> Descalso<00:02:42.090> don't<00:02:42.270> think<00:02:42.510> I

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
really do enjoy Descalso don't think I

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.210 
really do enjoy Descalso don't think I
don't<00:02:42.870> like<00:02:43.080> probably<00:02:43.470> state<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:43.950> color

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
don't like probably state the color

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.180 
don't like probably state the color
theme<00:02:44.820> early<00:02:45.270> back<00:02:45.540> which<00:02:46.530> looks<00:02:46.770> a<00:02:46.890> little

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
theme early back which looks a little

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.100 
theme early back which looks a little
bit<00:02:47.340> random<00:02:47.670> here<00:02:47.970> in<00:02:48.209> that<00:02:48.570> kind<00:02:48.750> of<00:02:48.780> bluish

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
bit random here in that kind of bluish

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.630 
bit random here in that kind of bluish
color<00:02:49.620> or<00:02:50.010> what<00:02:50.489> up<00:02:50.580> color<00:02:50.850> now<00:02:51.150> that<00:02:51.450> is<00:02:52.640> maybe

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
color or what up color now that is maybe

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.670 
color or what up color now that is maybe
it<00:02:54.209> would<00:02:54.630> be<00:02:54.780> able<00:02:54.870> to<00:02:55.050> make<00:02:55.230> it<00:02:55.380> a<00:02:55.410> little<00:02:55.500> bit

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
it would be able to make it a little bit

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.590 
it would be able to make it a little bit
cool<00:02:55.890> more<00:02:56.160> badass<00:02:56.400> but<00:02:57.209> it<00:02:57.300> doesn't<00:02:57.420> look

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
cool more badass but it doesn't look

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.860 
cool more badass but it doesn't look
like<00:02:57.660> a<00:02:57.870> big<00:02:58.050> phone<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:58.620> I<00:02:58.709> definitely<00:02:59.250> do

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
like a big phone and I definitely do

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.509 
like a big phone and I definitely do
enjoy<00:03:00.870> that<00:03:01.380> so<00:03:01.590> yeah<00:03:01.739> it's<00:03:02.010> quickly<00:03:02.340> look

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
enjoy that so yeah it's quickly look

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.009 
enjoy that so yeah it's quickly look
here<00:03:02.730> it<00:03:02.850> is<00:03:02.970> concept<00:03:03.360> hopefully<00:03:03.720> you<00:03:03.840> did

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
here it is concept hopefully you did

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.060 
here it is concept hopefully you did
enjoy<00:03:04.530> so<00:03:05.190> he's<00:03:05.910> all
