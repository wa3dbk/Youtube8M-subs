00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.290
Hey guys!

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.290
John here with RealTruck.com.

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:10.340
Today, I want to show you how to install the
Add-a-leaf Kit from Zone to this 2014 Chevy

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.840
Silverado.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.660
As you can see here, our Add-a-leaf Kit from
Zone Offroad Products comes with everything

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.370
you need to put this on your truck.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.860
The nice thing about this is is that if you're
hauling a heavy camper or trailer of some

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.810
sort, and you know how most of the time you
put that on the back of your truck, your truck

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.430
wants to really squat down hard.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.010
Well, what this is going to do, this is going
to help keep that a little bit more level

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.250
and it will increase the rear lift on the
truck by about an inch, inch and a half depending

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.000
on the truck and depending on how much settling
there is when you're not loaded.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.390
So what we got here is we have everything
to get it on the truck.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.070
We have our add-a-leafs.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.239
We have our spring clamps.

00:00:53.239 --> 00:01:00.010
And we also have our center pin, bolts, and
also our aluminum shim plates.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:08.780
So next thing we're going to do is start putting
this on the truck.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.090
The next thing we're going to do after we
get the wheels off is we're going to disconnect

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:21.640
our brake line bracket from the differential
right here.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.300
We got that loose.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:30.280
Next thing we're going to do is unclip our
ABS line from our frame rail, do our emergency

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.000
break bracket on the driver's side.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:49.659
And we're also going to remove this one up
here . . . 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:02:01.310
take our shocks off . . . and hang on to the
bolts because we'll need those to put the

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.390
new shocks on.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.840
There's also one more at the top we have to
take loose.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.359
Unfortunately, that one doesn't have a nut
on the backside.

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:29.930
It's built right into the bracket, so we don't
have to worry about trying to hang on to that.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.239
Once our shocks are off, then we're going
to pull our U-bolts off.

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.269
Now, when you get to this point, it's very
important that if you're doing this up in

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:42.780
the air, you have some kind of a jack, like
we have up underneath the differential here.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.840
And we'll take these off.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.799
All right guys, once we have the U-bolt off,
what we're going to do now is we're going

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:55.841
to slowly let this down so that we can remove
that factory block . . . as far as we want

00:02:55.841 --> 00:02:59.569
to go because we don't want to put too much
pressure on our ABS line here.

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:00.919
We'll take that new block out.

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:03.780
Let's wipe this off a little bit, clean it
up.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.469
Once we got our block out of the way, the
next thing we're going to do is take a couple

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:09.469
C-clamps.

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:17.129
We want to crank these down on either side
of our centering pin.

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.819
And if you're wondering what the centering
pin is, that would be this pin right here,

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.239
runs all the way through to the top.

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:28.769
What we're going to do is we're going to remove
that center pin, but we don't want these leafs

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:35.610
to come flinging apart when we do that because
one, it's dangerous, and two, it could damage

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.769
them.

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:44.080
Okay, once we have that clamped down, we'll
pull this center pin out of here.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.189
I'm taking its nut off here at the top, and
then we may have to drive it out.

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:53.269
We'll see what happens when we get the nut
off.

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:58.319
Okay, as you guys can see, we have the nut
off, but the pin's not coming out, which means

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.779
that we'll have to drive that out of there.

00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:05.709
So don't worry about damaging the center pin
because we're not going to be reusing it anyway,

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.989
so should be okay.

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.569
There we go.

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:10.829
We got that out.

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:16.209
Now, what we're going to do, once we have
that loose, is we're going to slowly release

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.920
these clamps because we need to get our add-a-leaf
in here.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.320
And we're not going to be able to do that
with these clamps on here.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.570
So it's important that we release these to
keep these things in line and not to release

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.330
them too fast that they go springing all over
the place.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.620
We keep everything nice and in order here
too, because you want to make sure that you

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:46.190
put everything back exactly the way it came
out.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.070
When you get this apart, you may notice on
some applications, there may be this pin that

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.730
sticking up here.

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.410
What you can do with this is it's just a roll
pin.

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.530
Just pull this leaf down out of here and drive
that roll pin out.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.450
What that is is that's a line up pin.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.690
It goes into the bottom of this other leaf,
but we need to put our add-a-leaf here in

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.450
the middle and our add-a-leaf doesn't have
this spot for the roll pin.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.870
Once we got that roll pin out of there, what
I want to do is I'm going to pull this bottom

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.850
leaf out.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.570
And then what we're going to do with this
is we're going to just lay it down here on

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:19.570
the floor.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:28.630
And we're going to take our add-a-leaf and
our add-a-leaf shim and our centering bolt,

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.710
and we're just going to put this together
and make sure that when we do this, we actually

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.210
get this into the correct hole, because remember
we had the one where we took the roll pin

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.210
out of.

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:51.280
And we don't want to put this back in that
hole because that just wont work.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:57.360
Okay, once we have this piece together, then
we'll set this back up into the truck.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.750
We slide this up in here.

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.390
We'll get this down in there.

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:14.450
Then what we want to do is lift this little
spring up, get it back on top of here.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:22.700
Then just make sure everything is lined up
properly here.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:30.400
Then what I'm going to do is I'm just going
to lift this rear end back up until that leaf

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.460
touches there.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:37.620
Once we have our stuff back together, we put
our plate back on top, our nut on our centering

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:38.620
bolt.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:44.980
Then what we're going to do here is we're
going to use our clamps and pull our springs

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:51.082
back together, because you don't want to actually
pull these together using this nut and bolt

00:06:51.082 --> 00:06:54.960
because it could damage it, strip the threads
or something like that.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:01.431
All right, now, what we're going to do here,
guys, is just snug this with our wrench, use

00:07:01.431 --> 00:07:03.030
our torque wrench.

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:07.420
And we're going to torque this center nut
down to 30-foot pounds.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.750
Okay, that's 30-foot pounds.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:14.750
So once we have that, then what we're going
to do is we're going let this rear end back

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:15.750
down a bit.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.639
At this point, then we can go ahead and remove
our C-clamps.

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:21.390
Once it's all together and torqued, let this
down.

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.470
We can remove our clamps.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:28.450
And then what we're going to do, at this point,
that will complete the installation of our

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:30.880
Add-a-leaf Kit for this side.
