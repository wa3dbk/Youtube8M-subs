00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hey people what goes and sincerely 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.740
 welcome to today's sequence yes me 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.630
 once thought 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.550
 I have to show it first hand 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.440
 as so often the point netzwerker gambled 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.059
 just thought to me a calm pole forward 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.990
 are so gambled with the friends and 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.520
 there we played it on the set and did 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.980
 catch a bit of collins 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.779
 collected and such and somehow off and on 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.000
 One reason was a moderate one 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.619
 in the game with it then there was so 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.449
 an epic fight so the scenes 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.130
 does not accompany you cut it 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.620
 somehow in that when I record 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.210
 could and then suddenly yes somehow 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.840
 thought motorcycle 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.789
 well he did not see that in gold 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.620
 From forget not averted that even 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.370
 do not win and then thought 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.539
 once yes, I 'm the substance less 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.039
 I know I like to get the system 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.289
 maybe he gets built up 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.020
 moderator points or as the case may be 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.850
 Band was not a poor but everyone 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.800
 If you read Canada you can go to the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.589
 hacks system update and definitely 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.750
 those are the people when you are 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.670
 People report the evil hedge and such 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.619
 they will be after the time or even 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.060
 not banned but the people then 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.729
 could not have gotten so 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.560
 message from gome such as you for 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.860
 you can just be more warned reason 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.509
 is hecking even live so not equal 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.439
 but probably live 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.030
 live your life oh whatever whichever 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.909
 you meant that one of me 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.380
 converted but you can on gamers.at 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:38.299
 to file a petition for dismissal 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.979
 yes great class I'm the next 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.020
 days will of course be really wet 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.670
 making the whole animal easy 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.289
 times my head makes you think oh me 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.679
 could play then you go in and 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:50.170
 Suddenly he was won shit true 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:52.890
 what he is doing now 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.619
 they what other players wasserspiegel 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:00.220
 all time properly collected here and so 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.770
 a reason for the moderator he good that 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.570
 fits already 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.530
 no matter what, I can even do it to you 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.210
 reenact the scene 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:12.970
 I have this map now not exactly 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:16.600
 rebuilt but he writes steep pass 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.569
 on such a proper app scenes comes yes 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.180
 in any case personally adjust 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.670
 trailing scene of respect 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.310
 trailing scene real german yes 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.310
 in any case and wien it was wise 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.040
 possible map 25 reach so above 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.709
 and here was opponents all over again 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.150
 quickly and suddenly we had one 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.590
 epic fight i had white i 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.540
 believe a slide sword enchanted because 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.540
 I had the data , I am clear and 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.190
 others do not know anyone 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.040
 case garbsen fight it straight 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.299
 the ceramic flew down but not 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.580
 also had jumped under me 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.920
 swept away I did not have a clue 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.209
 People I do not know why 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.560
 I was really warned 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.150
 but I hope that will come too 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.269
 Of course, here's real about it 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:05.220
 I'm glad that I even have video 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.220
 get sent or so and one 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:13.390
 but it does not quite understand 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.340
 you know that was right, I thought so 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.950
 Well, now I have a building application 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.299
 But the question is when is the 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.310
 finally answer like a bit 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.049
 Usually there are always so 1000 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.140
 Tickets or until the answers are 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:28.329
 125 20 weeks over or finally 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.870
 you get to be fallible away if you 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:35.519
 I'm hoping to get away 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.519
 that you will be able to do so soon 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.120
 Although I played hot games you see 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.390
 that is already the custom one 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.790
 legally save back to the main menu 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.390
 i never work i just work in 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.240
 to make a video 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.010
 it then comes on the childhood to channel 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.670
 out if you have interest you can 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.140
 of course, look purely yes otherwise was 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.940
 the short info video if times 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.770
 was applied or so for a reason 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.220
 fail or as clear as that can 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.330
 but it is normal 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.580
 Of course I hope that the building application 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:10.110
 soon you will finally work that 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:13.110
 theme fallible whatever else 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.110
 purely 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.010
 How this player works I know her 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.450
 what he wanted before of course 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.890
 first cut me off the way 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.240
 but of course he did not notice that 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.120
 behind them is still an adversary 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.920
 of course because she has not heard and 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.330
 the other opponent i wanted first 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.770
 look and other opponents wanted one 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.770
 real trace
