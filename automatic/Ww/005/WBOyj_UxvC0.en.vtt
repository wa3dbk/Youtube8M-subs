00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 Well, welcome one more day 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.470
 It had been a long time since I had 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.150
 I stopped to talk to you like that about your 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.870
 vote and good is that a stage of 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.610
 life a little weird a little weird and the 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.640
 truth is that I did not have that strength of 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.400
 put me to record in front of the camera 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.609
 made another reason is that in all 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.500
 this time from let's say August things 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.369
 so I would laugh and if I tell you the amount 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.650
 of books that you read you may have read 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.680
 34 books the truth is that I have not had 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.420
 during this time enough 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.940
 concentration to be able to 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.340
 plunge into a story and good 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.930
 I do not know if you can solve it I do not know 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.629
 if I'm going to have enough capacity 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.579
 as to continue reading to the rhythm 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.290
 I read before I do not know I do not want either 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.530
 press me 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.720
 lr when I see that I can do it and good 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.730
 already leaving aside all these excuses 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.430
 let's focus on what matters 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.960
 This video is that I wanted you today 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.850
 talk about a book that I've been reading 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.580
 one of the few books I read in 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.840
 all this time this book is the sad one 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.840
 story of your body on mine 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.550
 I've been with whites 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.480
 look at the cartoon 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.520
 I have the image too much more than mine 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.710
 and I wanted to talk about the sad story 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.130
 of your body on mine written by 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.650
 mark one man one is a composer is a 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.210
 singer-songwriter who makes very cool songs 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.950
 if you have not heard any I will 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.540
 I will leave in the description one of your 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.820
 songs one with which I feel very 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.040
 identified that defines pretty well my 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.290
 history in life the sad story 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.830
 of your body on mine is a book of 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.510
 contemporary poetry and some texts is 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.880
 a book that I enjoyed very much and 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.220
 that has helped me you can not even imagine 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.050
 how much I love the way it has 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.360
 Marwan's writing has a very pen 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.490
 yours and at least it seems very 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.210
 real that makes when you read his poems 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.070
 or your texts reach you a lot and you 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.650
 you feel very identified with them 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.570
 because we have all passed the things that 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.760
 account marván the prologue of the magazine 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.860
 your body's story about mine is 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.450
 written by his brother by the brother of 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.090
 Marwan and I wanted to read you a piece of 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.370
 this text with which I'm pretty much 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.690
 agreement and that the truth is that it is 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.040
 one of those texts from the book that made me 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.080
 how to see me completely won the 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.690
 goose bumps so good I'll read 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.129
 I say so my brother kicks in 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.930
 small when he felt frustrated 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.180
 the camps arrived when 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.980
 he felt abandoned his skin possesses a 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.810
 characteristic call of the mold graphism 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.950
 which consists of any contact you 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.349
 leaves a mark that took a while 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.819
 erased when you finish reading this book 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.280
 will understand that I am talking about 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.110
 virtues because it is not such a virtue 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.700
 sensitivity is not a virtue that has 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.950
 decided not to stay for him to ruminate 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.720
 the in spiteful solitude but to transform 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.310
 what is perceived is adventure or pain joy 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.459
 or misery be the answer 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.590
 gratefulness rancor in beauty if the 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.690
 skin is sensitive that will not leave a mark on 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.760
 the soul of those brands tells this 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.190
 book with the sincerity and truth of 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.250
 the one we were talking to the one she talks to 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.480
 and it is the truth is that it is a text that a 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.879
 bit of text that thrills a lot 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.220
 and more knowing that the writings also 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:17.890
 his brother and the truth is that I'm 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:21.880
 completely in accordance with what he says 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:24.520
 I think that it maintains a capacity 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.800
 to convey what he feels and with a 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.720
 sensitivity so beautifully that 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.300
 come I think I could get to 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.860
 I honestly believe that this 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.010
 more than review is simply a 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.870
 recommendation because it is very difficult 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.910
 review this book I recommend you 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.530
 very much the sad story of your 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.000
 body on mine that book that I'm 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.980
 I'm sure you're going to love me 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.530
 I wanted to read a poem so you can see a 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.210
 little the way of writing that has 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.860
 marwan so you can see a bit the kind of 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.930
 poetry that writes 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.960
 so I'm going to it this is called 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.000
 considerations regarding forgetting and 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.920
 says forgetting is a discipline without 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.050
 geometry is the same as remembering a 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.430
 faceless girl is like the mirrors that 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.240
 they do not remember their visitors 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.730
 Seconds later 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.280
 it's an emotion without a name going back to 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.470
 to feel nothing the oblivion contracts a 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.420
 undone bed is the rival of the afternoon in 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.400
 that I photograph you naked and is that 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.930
 turn your heart into a trench and 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.079
 your memory in a landfill of moments 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.600
 sweet forgetting always takes on 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.680
 love like a spiteful girlfriend is the 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.600
 price to have loved and not to have known 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.750
 Havana when you bet all the 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.520
 blue box of his look 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.260
 is to run in the opposite direction to 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.850
 caresses is a room with everything 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.980
 changed of place but without nobody inside 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.990
 is the question that the bars of 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.800
 people and the answer that fills the glasses 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.449
 of mouths 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.069
 it is also the concrete corner of the 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:44.259
 land that has not been inhabited because my 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:45.550
 maps look at the past because I have one hundred 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:47.370
 a thousand spots together a man in the 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.930
 memory 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.060
 keeps chasing me at night a 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.699
 hidden message of your earrings you 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.250
 silhouette view backlight your laugh like a 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:58.590
 Apple open its pubis of anemones 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.600
 held by the dream the pure geometry 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.580
 Nordic of all men that stretched up 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.169
 me like a summer night 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.720
 on the shelves I can not fit anymore 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:10.420
 memories and it's also good for you 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.580
 I just made my decision today go down to 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.840
 park and I will sit in a bank to 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.940
 wait for the pigeons to walk 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.610
 around my life and peck up 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:21.129
 that there is not even a grain of your memory 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.469
 I like very much this poem is I think 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:24.789
 which is one of my book favorites 

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:27.939
 as you have already heard is a poem that 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:29.919
 talks about forgetting and about the difficult 

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:32.259
 which is sometimes forgetting certain 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:34.060
 people and how he himself says oblivion 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:35.800
 is the concrete place on earth that does not 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.020
 be living but I also like it a lot 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.710
 this poem because it ends up taking a 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:45.490
 decision and ends up taking the decision of 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:47.139
 forget not maybe not forget because it is 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.060
 something that does not depend so much on 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:51.669
 us but if you make the decision to 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.710
 keep going forward and try 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:55.990
 look as little as possible to the past and it's 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.659
 something that I quite like this of this 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:01.930
 good and finally now yes and for 

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:04.479
 end this recommendation and I read a 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.919
 last poem is more called 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:09.250
 considerations regarding the 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:11.650
 sadness and it's like the part that would come 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:14.770
 after considerations regarding 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:16.479
 I forget and well says well sometimes it's not 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.860
 that the world is sad but that they are my 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:20.469
 eyes that harbor sadness with 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.700
 I look at it and it soaks all things 

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:23.590
 that surround me 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.660
 and then my mother's sadness comes 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:27.880
 the sadness of my father the sadness of 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.230
 the intact sheets the dexterity of the 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.060
 books that the separated lovers are 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.650
 they forget in their old houses the 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.730
 sadness of the politicians who dreamed of 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.680
 change the world and they had to 

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:37.030
 forget it the distances of families 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.130
 many that only have one dish 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:41.800
 and for those who take dessert is a whole 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.750
 event the sadness of the rivers 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.330
 that dry even the sadness of 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:48.610
 have finally overcome 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.740
 I know that melancholy belongs to me and 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.629
 that maybe neither my mother nor my father nor the 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:54.340
 sheets or the forgotten books of the 

00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:56.349
 politicians of large families- nor 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.689
 the dry rivers realize no 

00:06:56.349 --> 00:07:01.180
 kind of sadness iván his things like 

00:06:58.689 --> 00:07:03.219
 something totally common but what I have 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.750
 clear is that ours is overcome 

00:07:03.219 --> 00:07:07.389
 really the saddest thing that has 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:10.150
 passed to love in all his life and good 

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:12.610
 with this with this poem I finish this 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:15.310
 recommendation I would like very much 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:18.639
 much that if you read it, you would tell me which 

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:20.770

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:22.300

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.440
