00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.000
 we are placing the chicken already cut in 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.440
 chunks 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.230
 yes because the first thing we're going to do 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.360
 it's dizzy a little bit and we're going to give it 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.920
 a few turns with the medium fire 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:57.110
 strong and we'll leave it a few minutes 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.560
 with salt of course and a little 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.750
 pepper to taste 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.120
 we make him dizzy we give him a few 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.040
 turns until it's toasted 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.140
 once we have marked it that it has already 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.960
 caught a color like gold we 're going to 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:16.780
 take out let's reserve to a paper 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.780
 absorbing all that fat 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.660
 now let's measure one of the three 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:28.090
 potatoes to the oil and we are going to make them dizzy 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.770
 this is optional I do this myself 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.840
 it even improves the fia like that but I 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.690
 like that then one of the potatoes is 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.700
 jaw 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.710
 when the potatoes are a little brown 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.410
 we are going to add the onion and the pepper 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.030
 let's give it a couple of laps and as 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.800
 I had forgotten to add now of 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.150
 the chemical days to take a 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:50.480
 little color and already 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.299
 today the peppers we add a few 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.209
 laurel leaves I have added four leaves 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:58.220
 of laurel and now if we dizzy everything up 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:02.010
 that the onion and the pepper are well 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.930
 pochado that are soft 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.090
 when the vegetables are well poached 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.610
 we add the chicken again and 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.209
 we mix two let's make it dizzy all 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:14.459
 together a couple of minutes and we're going to 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:18.730
 incorporate the tomato that we have well 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:21.069
 chopped about two ripe tomatoes 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.069
 The objective is to offer a little 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:26.799
 tomato and now let's add a 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:29.680
 little more salt also pepper 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:32.500
 ground black and we remove everything well 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.629
 to mix it and we are stirring from time to time 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.700
 when until the tomato falls apart 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:39.420
 We are totally helping you with a 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.670
 spatula or a wooden spoon 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.530
 when we have it the tomato 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.980
 totally undone we are going to add you 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.870
 like a glass of white wine 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.150
 approximately and we leave it a minute 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.830
 to evaporate alcohol and now you 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.580
 let's add the chicken broth 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.160
 ecological and lactose-free as we said 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:01.800
 and we are going to add him then 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.980
 a couple of glasses until it covers all the 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.980
 chicken 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.500
 we are going to give a touch of color well 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.209
 with coloring or better if you have saffron 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.909
 We are going to put a handful in the 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.190
 mortar and the broth that we have 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:20.709
 warming up let's take a little 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:24.370
 a cup we add a little salt 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:26.199
 and the broth that we have taken hot and 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.910
 we add it to the saffron and we're going to 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:31.030
 remove so a little crushing it in the 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:34.300
 mortar so we will enhance everything 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.699
 the color and flavor of saffron already 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.550
 last we add it to our rings to 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:42.550
 the pot and now let's leave it to fire 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:45.310
 medium or short at least 40 minutes 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.860
 go reducing the broth like that to fire 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.900
 slow and non-stop to remove so that 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.810
 stick it is important to keep an eye on what 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:56.160
 the goal is to get a salsita like that 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:59.289
 thick that is to suck your fingers 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:04.270
 and wet all the bread we serve it with 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:06.940
