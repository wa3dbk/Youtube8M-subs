 living of susana but of motorcycles and a 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.670
 thing like that there happens all the 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.760
 motorcycling 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.990
 we follow 030 with him and each motorbike has the 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.870
 activity of Argentine contest of 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.550
 motorcycling the most important category 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.739
 in that it generates globalist pilots the 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.770

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.829
 superbike is provided with the market tati 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.570
 the boys more and gerardo of the Uruguayan the 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.829
 most of the boys have gone through 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.230
 the earth ovals because it's from the 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.719
 school and so we are in the program and 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.110
 we are in the garage with this program

 Sunday with the supermotard cup that 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.129
 we are putting on screen that while 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.750
 is very strong for next year is 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.550
 in the presentation 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.500
 in motorcycling all weekend 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.120
 thanks to the light people that I 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.300
 Hold on and you will also have to put up with me 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.670
 When there is Moto GP, it is true that 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.620
 good is the world championship and there 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.050
 with martÃ­n urruty we do the motorcycle if 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.200
 there is already a great team so 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.940
 we are connected with the bike always 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.119
 you know what I'm going to do now I'm going to 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.560
 make a meeting because among so many 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.890
 questions saw that this month we're 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.840
 answering questions doubts 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.820
 I look for old engines to show you 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.009
 now how can I make a board 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.759
 put a scissors the frame with the paper 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:44.220
 Look carefully hammer the ball 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.080
 Joint paper and the piece firmly grasped 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.440
 it's a tail of scooters since it took 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.270
 as an axis, look what happens with this 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.010
 be careful not to give him hard because 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.340
 then no longer 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:02:00.380
 I support the paper here and if I start 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.380
 hit the outline look 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.730
 I just have to move 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.250
 when the board does not exist, not if it 's fair 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.800
 if there was the will to buy if it is a 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.990
 Sunday and they have board paper and what 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.920
 they have to do good what can they do 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:22.400
 see there is 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.860
 9 slowly without hurting the aluminum with 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.480
 a very small hammer some me 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.069
 will be saying you know the type that 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.459
 they're going to ruin the stage because they're going to 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:34.630
 give as if it were the ones you do not have to give 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.630
 very little 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.349
 there it goes 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:47.799
 very slowly on the edge this is going 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:52.670
 shortening look and there is step and down that already 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:55.459
 we passed the lip that has this part 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.400
 and we do not start to cut the edge 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.750
 look at the edge of the board if 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.520
 they want to start with this also they 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.940
 can we go to the inside like this 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:09.620
 is more verbose before you see 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:13.940
 look with this part quote to this and here 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:15.950
 they are following the outline of a very 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.640
 slowly 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:22.879
 it important not to break anything hits it very 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:26.569
 softly hit the paper with the 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:29.900
 hammer that makes it cuts sees how it 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:33.440
 short but there was cut this is the 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.860
 angle that we need we give you there and if 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.440
 it is missing a bit later it helps 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.330
 With the scissors, look at the paper 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.220
 short without any problem like this is a 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.750
 fresh paper 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.220
 this was not ready what am I 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.050
 doing at the moment as if I 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.780
 did for me so that you what 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.620
 learn but there's the cut of the 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:58.330
 notice 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.709
 it is perfectly shifted there and now 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.209
 we cut the outside part I have time 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.049
 from the outside 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:07.720
 look have it so you do not move them 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:11.799
 so that it does not move there goes split 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:15.159
 little girl little ball other but very 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:17.019
 little kid do not abuse the piece do not break it 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:22.599
 there goes 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:24.610
 there goes like this slowly this I 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:26.860
 they asked so many times that one day 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.870
 what good will I do as if I did it 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.730
 the board the first time 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.070
 because if I will not say no 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:38.570
 wants a tip that I made if this is 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:40.430
 I tell it and you do not see it because 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.800
 speak a lot of people who talk but who 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.620
 do I see little I know 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.080
 and again I saw some notes that to me 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.539
 love when I talk about motorcycles or some 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.180
 comparative and I'm saying that this 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:54.800
 model has this and this model has the 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.050
 another one if you did not record it and I show it to you 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.090
 you how do you guess and I can 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.220
 tell but if I do not show it is 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.919
 difficult to realize the subject is not 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.990
 true then so that people will 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:08.419
 carry something important from the programs 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.310
 of mechanical motorcycle sometimes things 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:12.530
 you have to make them so they do not look 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.199
 count them only and well there to have the 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.949
 together and how the holes are made 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:18.249
 weather 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:21.159
 good look 

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:23.439
 if they are marked with an ink and 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:27.339
 you marked the holes with these 

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:29.889
 pieces that are punching grab a 

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:31.689
 little piece of wood that is to say you have 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:35.349
 to make a little hole and with the sac 

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:38.619
 snack you just made me the 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:41.769
 hole there's no weird thing if 

00:05:38.619 --> 00:05:44.079
 you are here central the board you set 

00:05:41.769 --> 00:05:45.849
 where is the hole and with the ball the 

00:05:44.079 --> 00:05:49.179
 smallest point small hammer 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:52.629
 you look for it and see that it is marked see 

00:05:49.179 --> 00:05:56.249
 so much quality because there he is giving 

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:56.249
 and the little hole is made 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.909
 perfect is 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.349
 If I have more time the term is all 

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:05.830
 Well, I sell her the alcohol board 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:08.349
 I said to this one but this to the people of 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.629
 alfara a lot of people there is that manufactures 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:13.090
 together bring and here in old models and 

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:15.699
 new models but if there is not one or a 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:18.099
 English bike or want to do because 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:21.069
 you want to make a good joint paper 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:23.979
 Well, there's no such thing as I tell you without 

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:27.320
 break absolutely nothing hitting 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:29.360
 Slow down like that 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:33.020
 and you're doing all the little holes 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:35.510
 of the turn without moving the board if you 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:38.060
 moves partridge that can not move the 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:40.700
 board has to be centered so 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:43.910
 good will there is peeling off bits 

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:47.200
 it looks and have the board finished is left 

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:49.090
 time in this block 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.190
 many asked me what was 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.870
 putting together and we were looking for a part 

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:54.360
 that is not so simple by the edge 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.980
 to show you how it's done but 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:07:01.230
 easily make the board and you have left 

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:01.230
 perfect break and we'll go back 

00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:06.189
 good if the board is in the market 

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:07.749
 make it go buy it but if not 

00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:10.240
 they have to do because there is not this is 

00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:12.129
 one bond method could teach another that 

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:15.069
 It is done by putting a little oil 

00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:17.319
 between the exhaust tail of the bikes that 

00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:20.139
 motorcycle transit worn revolvers and 

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:22.629
 there is a black fat that with that 

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:23.979
 to be able to mark impeccably any 

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:26.129
 you have to do and want 

00:07:23.979 --> 00:07:28.809
 cut out but another day that's something else 

00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:31.869
 now we are going to see an entrepreneurship of 

00:07:28.809 --> 00:07:33.909
 motomel in a very special dealer 

00:07:31.869 --> 00:07:36.789
 that really has a lot to do with what 

00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:38.619
 what was lived and the marketing and this time 

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:41.009
 where the client has to have 

00:07:38.619 --> 00:07:41.009
 all the amenities 

00:07:42.569 --> 00:07:47.129
 good at full speed we continue because there 

00:07:44.789 --> 00:07:49.169
 more to show you but that in the 

00:07:47.129 --> 00:07:51.499
 block that comes after the break we go back 

00:07:49.169 --> 00:07:51.499
 to follow
