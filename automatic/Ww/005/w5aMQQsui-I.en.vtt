00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660 
and they said when there was a crack

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.690 
and they said when there was a crack
just<00:00:26.020> this<00:00:26.200> top<00:00:26.529> crack<00:00:26.860> that<00:00:27.340> they<00:00:27.460> wouldn't

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:27.700 
just this top crack that they wouldn't

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.550 
just this top crack that they wouldn't
replace<00:00:28.060> it<00:00:28.270> unless<00:00:28.480> they<00:00:28.660> really<00:00:29.020> needed<00:00:29.259> to

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
replace it unless they really needed to

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.370 
replace it unless they really needed to
so<00:00:30.189> yeah<00:00:31.090> I<00:00:31.119> could<00:00:31.450> take<00:00:31.630> into<00:00:31.869> them<00:00:32.050> like<00:00:32.200> this

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:32.380 
so yeah I could take into them like this

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.080 
so yeah I could take into them like this
but<00:00:32.590> let's<00:00:32.770> make<00:00:32.920> sure<00:00:33.160> that<00:00:33.430> they're<00:00:33.790> going

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
but let's make sure that they're going

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.910 
but let's make sure that they're going
to<00:00:34.210> replace<00:00:34.600> it<00:00:34.720> this<00:00:34.960> time<00:00:35.230> I<00:00:35.410> mean<00:00:35.680> obviously

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
to replace it this time I mean obviously

00:00:35.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
to replace it this time I mean obviously
we<00:00:36.430> don't<00:00:36.520> mean<00:00:36.730> together<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:38.020> let's<00:00:38.230> see

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:03:34.080 

Oh<00:03:31.420> ends<00:03:32.420> the<00:03:32.630> story<00:03:32.870> of<00:03:33.050> the<00:03:33.170> Chromebook

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
Oh ends the story of the Chromebook

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.550 
Oh ends the story of the Chromebook
honestly<00:03:35.090> I<00:03:35.120> expected<00:03:35.270> to<00:03:35.720> put<00:03:35.900> it<00:03:35.990> in<00:03:36.110> pieces

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
honestly I expected to put it in pieces

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.810 
honestly I expected to put it in pieces
but<00:03:36.860> um<00:03:37.390> for<00:03:38.390> the<00:03:38.510> warranty<00:03:39.020> I'm<00:03:39.140> supposed<00:03:39.530> to

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
but um for the warranty I'm supposed to

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.820 
but um for the warranty I'm supposed to
give<00:03:40.820> this<00:03:41.030> back<00:03:41.240> and<00:03:41.540> I<00:03:41.600> figured<00:03:42.050> that<00:03:42.260> maybe

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
give this back and I figured that maybe

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.530 
give this back and I figured that maybe
now<00:03:43.220> they'll<00:03:43.520> think<00:03:43.760> that<00:03:43.850> it's<00:03:44.120> destroyed

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
now they'll think that it's destroyed

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.960 
now they'll think that it's destroyed
enough<00:03:46.180> so<00:03:47.180> yeah<00:03:47.420> I<00:03:48.040> I<00:03:49.040> hope<00:03:49.340> you<00:03:49.520> enjoyed<00:03:49.820> this
