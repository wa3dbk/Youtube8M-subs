00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.379
 Hi, I'm Mariana and this time 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.500
 I want to talk about a book that I read 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:08.810
 recently and I liked it very much so 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.420
 I have been going to recommend is the the 

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.550
 book is I before you bring it the 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.139
 editorial sum of letters and the truth is 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.509
 I gave this book 5 5 stars 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.060
 because I liked it so much that I took a 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:21.859
 little in reading it but for other matters not 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.529
 because I do not like the book is a 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:27.470
 little busy and if it took me like some 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.810
 three weeks to read it but I enjoyed it 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.640
 pretty and now I'm going to tell you about 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.180
 What is this book we have the bis 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.510
 clarified a 26-year-old young woman who 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.289
 he knows a lot of things but what he does not 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.359
 he knows that he will soon lose his job 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:47.120
 and will have to find another one to be able 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:48.949
 support your family because in the house there 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.370
 things go very well and what neither 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:56.269
 is expected luisa is going to fall in the 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.500
 hands of a man too rude 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:01.830
 but 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.769
 have a good excuse to do it will 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.659
 He suffered an accident a few years ago and 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.869
 stay 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.920
 wheelchair is quadriplegic who 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.750
 he can not use his legs or his arms 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.750
 then even though he has a 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.980
 nurse who takes care of wilde's mother 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:26.780
 requires the services of luisa 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:29.450
 so that the company for what 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.930
 because I do not know protagonist luisa clear is 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.450
 too funny to have is someone is 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.289
 someone 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:42.080
 totally different from what he will 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:45.050
 I could have known in his past life 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.470
 she is a very woman 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:52.340
 Smart dresses 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:56.030
 if you dress in a very weird way but it's 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.670
 good and weird in the sense that it is 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.800
 different but it's very good to start from 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.490
 that their first meeting is not at all 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:08.810
 nice little by little they get to know each other 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:11.780
 better and they end up learning things the 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.060
 one over the other the truth is that book 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.010
 you get a lot and not only because it will 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.200
 It is tetraplegic, not for everything that 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.530
 entails for example we have luisa 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:25.100
 he has never excelled in his life let's say 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:28.190
 that when she loses her job her 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:32.320
 parents is like well now what are you going 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.320
 to work is not good at something 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.180
 like they do not believe in it they do not expect 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.180
 nothing about her and maybe that's why 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.400
 Louise does not expect anything from it there 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.000
 some circumstances that make you 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.150
 feel a little angry about how they are 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.310
 happening those things 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.799
 because Luis is going through those 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.709
 situations that yes the name of luisa 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:03:01.030
 what it is to care for wild is something that she does not 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:03.189
 was expected and far from thinking that 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:07.400
 was going to get something good out of that is a 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:12.519
 book that touches many fibers but 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.519
 to me better a good choice 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:20.440
 what is he living 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:24.560
 you have everything to live so 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.830
 and even if I did not have it I think that 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.380
 you have to focus on the good osa will 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.840
 although I understand will 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.470
 that is bitter because he is in a chair 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:39.050
 Wheel made me a bit negative and 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.000
 even though you see how they evolve as 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.400
 the characters are growing and both of 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.130
 announces the situations presented to you 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.380
 this life let's see what we have for the 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.290
 assumptions in one hand we have luisa 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.360
 who is super talkative always walks 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.640
 like a good mood and then we have to 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.470
 will be a bit bitter but it is 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.940
 understandable due to their situation 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.950
 although from time to time there are good days 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:05.650
 and will walk in a good mood 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.510
 which is very surprising to louis at 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.840
 Once I thought about it a lot it appears in this 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:14.349
 video because I do not know how to land my 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:19.250
 ideas I do not want to confuse them I do not want 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:22.120
 give them no spoilers so 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.160
 I do not know how this video will look 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.169
 I believe that I before you is a book 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.750
 beautiful that is worth reading 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:31.060
 for you so do not wait any longer and go to 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.889
 read this book because I really feel 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.960
 that you are going to get something very good from him and 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:37.570
 You will like it as I saw, I know, I know that 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.060
 I did not want maybe this video is very 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:43.320
 short and he did not want to go into many 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.240
 details because no 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.400
 you know, I always want to create the 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.639
 books and 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.080
 good judge for yourself and this has 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:53.729
 been all for this video I hope that you 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.009
 have liked it and give it a chance to 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.630
 me before you and tell me later what 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:59.580
 they seemed to me the book I am even that 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.840
 a lot and it can be our video 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.840
 take care pretty bye 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.740
 and I wanted to tell you that I gave this book 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.990
 5 without building and assen guthrie because 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.670
 the truth is that I really liked is 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.320
 something totally different from what 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.040
 I've always read is a little more mature 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:21.680
 because the protagonist is 26 years old and 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:23.510
 the situations that he lives are adults of 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.540
 time that identified because the 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:29.900
 protagonist is unemployed 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:31.740
 then once the same thing happened to me and it was 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.080
 as 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.490
 and nothing else in the book the 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.009
 protagonist does not have the support of his 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.569
 parents like they do not believe in it not 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:42.330
 they believe that she can get ahead or 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:43.910
 that can get a better job from 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:49.270
 that they had 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:51.880
 still life puts her in a place 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:54.460
 where you have a lot to learn 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:57.430
 very much that 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:01.630
 let's say that review has never done 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:06.789
 nothing outstanding in his life he did not study 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:08.979
 a race has not done let's say not 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:10.750
 has done nothing in particular is a 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:14.680
 very interesting person I like a lot 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:16.360
 how do you think or how of things by 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.849
 example where he worked likes to see 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.319
 to the clients and imagine how that 

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:22.210
 analyze what they were doing in 

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:25.120
 those moments that were going to be after 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:28.990
 all that and willy was a very name 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:32.440
 successful that he was doing very well in the 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:36.240
 work with women is very rich 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:39.490
 then nothing was missing in life 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:42.800
 fate was so cruel that 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:45.590
 that had to suffer that accident 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:49.009
 so I think the two learn in 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:50.539
 things that they did not know or that 

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:52.789
 Maybe if they knew for example in the 

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:56.449
 case of luisa luisa had many dreams 

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:58.909
 and things but life sometimes makes 

00:06:56.449 --> 00:07:01.150
 keep those dreams in a drawer or 

00:06:58.909 --> 00:07:04.360
 that you forget about them 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:06.970
 and I no longer find meaning in your life and 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.000
 instead let's say that of certain 

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.000
 way 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:15.349
 let's say that luisa's purpose is 

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:18.169
 make will feel better and the purpose 

00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:21.650
 of will unconsciously is that being that 

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:23.569
 luisa viva that what does not stay 

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:27.110
 with arms crossed and go and 

00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:30.069
 they pursue their dreams because only 

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:30.069
 you have a life and 

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.470
 what are you doing with it
