00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.809
 there were all kinds of come today blades 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.580
 shugur today we go with the sonic team this 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.380
 has won the bug type by vote 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.759
 I am a small machine voting and has 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.980
 won the type vision they are very 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.420
 close the sinister type so let's go 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.029
 first with bug types in the first 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.500
 place you already know that this team does not 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.090
 it means that it is the best or does not want 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.699
 say that it is the best of the best 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.980
 of bug type but if they are 6 pokemon that 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.060
 I think they would work very well then 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.820
 as I have always said in all 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.230
 rallies could could it be varying to me 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.690
 works for me this improvement does not work that 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.149
 the worst and you can go changing not me 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.579
 chosen these 6 and I think I'm sure that 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.890
 it will work very well ok we start with 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.809
 the first one that is for 3 we put you 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.030
 skill robustness hectic nature 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.149
 to maximize your defense you 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.829
 we will put the sets in 252 in measure 252 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.170
 in defense and 63 specials those that 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.629
 there are too many objects that you have commented on attacks 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.270
 Toads or spikes toxic or trap rocks twist 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.430
 fast and explosion misshapen strategy 3 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.739
 out infect the opponent with the spikes and 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.600
 toxic leaks take away from the other the barbs 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.549
 the traps that we put the rival 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.200
 and when we are bad of life exploit us 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.030
 It's that easy because it's our 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.320
 defensive wall and here I have a lot 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.509
 Beware of special attacks because 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.040
 way that is not not very good at that but 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.170
 Yes, it is an excellent barrier 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.149
 before we put you connected because 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.100
 pos and if it is still physical from the 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.290
 rival who wanted to hit us in the 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.720
 would stop all we do not have the rival and 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.520
 then explode and masters that's the the 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.170
 deformed function 3 not as leader of 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.270
 logically team first physical them 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.820
 whippet I've got advisor I know what state 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.100
 venus that is today et cetera but in 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.649
 unite and gmb advisors the most of what 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.970
 more than the best together with durant that 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.220
 we can find physics is very 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.750
 tender so I elected advisors or 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.360
 Focus favorites even if it's over used 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.610
 and I think it's worth a month to put it in 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.190
 These expert skill rally 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.710
 Logically firm nature is attack 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.240
 speed and life those that are left over 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.590
 is yes zorita not realities but life 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.869
 braking I have saved for another pokemon 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.090
 I want later you will see him put a battering ram and 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.830
 would be our mega is and short that is 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.200
 least seen the mega if they are at least 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.539
 not something we take out we put him to attacks 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.340
 one goes the chase and back and 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.060
 sword dance and is the typical guardian to be 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.130
 and taking advantage of and back for this one 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.160
 1 worth persecution for your skill is 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.450
 our physical by definition of 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.910
 second physics of the wii but I have chosen 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.099
 that is eshkol and is name colipe 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.340
 quite strange skill and pushed the 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:29.530
 life is hidden and firm nature 250 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.200
 and an attack 116 in defense and 126 in 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.239
 speed I think it's call and ask would be 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.650
 a pokémon very to take into account in 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.360
 our meeting because it will be the one that 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.800
 would cover a bit of the pokémon type 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.269
 So you fire that we should have 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.120
 fear together with form three and together with 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.620
 that and apart this and another we can more than 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.760
 then I'll say it in the dark do not tell 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.500
 a lot against the fire types that gives us 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.299
 very afraid I do not know everything to have those 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.340
 strong as I said by that fire for 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:54.850
 four we will put you on tape object 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.860
 expert and earthquake protection attacks 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.410
 Cuyano Horn Cinema Strategy is 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.750
 coll and pd would come out and you throw me protection 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.310
 so that solid impulse rise for a your 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.500
 speed and then materials because a 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.090
 guy earthquake consul whose noxious me 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.450
 agreement the grandfather guys you can also 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.920
 choose to go out to do protection and for 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.950
 the relay give me for example putting 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.299
 ciba and with this one your designs the 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.160
 speed road because very slow down 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.380
 example as the sixth pokemon that now 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.150
 then I will tell 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.190
 and you go out and then we'll be full 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.590
 the speed we do not go with the first 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.270
 special is very per què espí trillion the 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.430
 skill eye compound a trace 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.190
 fearful these 150 are special attacks 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.900
 the 150 are speed 6 in life and you 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.790
 we put object band focus attacks 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.830
 somnolent gale buzz and dance 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.010
 leteo these stevie trillion you already know 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.900
 because it is and in my team collection 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.630
 that I tell you and it has saved me from many 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.550
 and logically I could not miss here is 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.290
 the very simple script axis would come out 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.520
 we would do somniferous to the rival not 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.710
 we would be with a falete oy 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.570
 we will start to burst him with gale and 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.280
 buzz and if we are lucky to gale 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.410
 it causes confusion we will win a 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.960
 extra shift guys so he lived can 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.080
 be very lethal and attention guys to 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.180
 pokemon special whippet developer or 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.130
 very dangerous that people lately 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.640
 I do not see any team and it can be 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.320
 bestial and bestial even more than a billion 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.660
 is already in mega the mega has skill and 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.090
 impulse equal that is colipe de 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.380
 modest nature is 6 in life 200 of 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.330
 special attack gloves and 2 where 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.850
 contains a speed and object life 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:26.160
 Sphere 30 points to those damage attacks 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.920
 not her mega strategy 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.810
 very simple we do protection see you 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.780
 with a speed and nobody wins us in 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.150
 speed then they put him and masters 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.970
 aerial with this and cooling and can do 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.890
 back to the rival buzz this app and 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.170
 can download special psychic defense 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.720
 for those guys fight or swim tour 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.340
 for water type and guys if you can 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.960
 that if they want to put a protection of 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.310
 once in a while when you see that rival 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.140
 do something that can hurt and you go up 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.210
 even more the speed would be impressive 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.460
 already friend can do a lot of damage 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.600
 guys in a lot was doing h out 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.820
 all at all time if they do not have 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.820
 No pokemon fire or steel equipment 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:05.340
 careful let's go with the sixth pokemon and 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.040
 last to finalize the uni team of 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.110
 guy said that I chose that armed not 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:12.450
 we can first forgotten in the in the 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.160
 forgetfulness and is a pokémon that we 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:18.030
 Can protect from the famous heel 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.350
 flame even though it has a stone and no 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.360
 he has a lot of physical defense 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.730
 found no any guard of 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.560
 special defense so be very very 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.050
 good and it's not typical that you're not 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.570
 that one and chosen this little to finish 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.770
 since this is physical les güipe and the 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.310
 rival no better do not expect it to 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.100
 be a tilde 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.210
 because it is very very forgotten and has a 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.730
 Advantage has hard soul skill 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.530
 battle that prevents critical hits and 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.990
 we can with firm nature is in life 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.070
 in attack and those that come out in defense 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.980
 objects remains so that they cure each 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:50.320
 turn until it's stoned guys and from 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:53.230
 evolution and poison x apart polish 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.210
 guys if this pokemon has a cop 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.610
 ment with the attack ability that 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:59.470
 has and repeating attacks by state 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.300
 as a demolition stone to break 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.410
 barriers on nike x with high pulley 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.600
 critical blow and tenth in ar 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:07.630
 careful with the command of guys is very 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.860
 very good pokemon guys this is a itin 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.780
 of bug type I hope it has been delayed 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.980
 a lot I've already told you that you do not want 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.720
 say it's the best but yes that 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.800
 they are doing good functions and between 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.960
 them I think you can help 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.850
 heap can not there are simply more 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.170
 to change for example instead of leader 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.970
 of forum 3 can be towards the goal 

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.500
 perfectly or take it out but I know it's 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:25.420
 very seen and adopted by fort of three not 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.100
 that was least seen so to speak 

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.030
 another physics of the coup that we can catch 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.440
 count on him 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:31.690
 there are many not instead of if we can only 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.700
 count on as said before but 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:35.980
 I have chosen these six I hope that you 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.660
 Like I hope we leave comments and 

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:40.210
 that's liked the one dude team 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:44.819
 guys I love you so much 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:44.819
 yes yes yes yes yes yes, hug me and chau
