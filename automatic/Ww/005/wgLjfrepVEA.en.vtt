 the literal excavator manufacturer 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:12.440
 has a legacy of almost 150 years in the creation of products for the 

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:13.439
 productivity 

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:17.509
 our spirit of curiosity combined with computer vision does not

 had the factor x 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.610
 in 1874 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.550
 he patented the link bell drive belt as a solution for reduction

 of operating interruptions 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:44.339
 and to increase the productivity of the crop machinery

 the use of intel technology 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:53.899
 has been applied to various industrial uses in the course of the 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.929
 the 20th century when we introduced full function deflation in combination with 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:00.540
 hydraulic controls in the early 20th century 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.420
 this represents a major step forward.

 prepared the ground for future conceptions of hydraulic controls 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.720
 and resulted in the creation of the law until the end ls 98

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.470
 and uses the first electronic fuel injection engine 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.030
 the series of tests was increased with the addition of the excavators with radius
