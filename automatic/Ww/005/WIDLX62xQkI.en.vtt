00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.529
 keep looking 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.789
 he throws the movie today 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.239
 is about a little extreme angle 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:32.710
 that is something that I myself do not go with 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.670
 i like you to play so i have french toulouse last 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.660
 dark sides, I think 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.680
 saab is orange white blue I know a lot what to do and then it looks eventually 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.260
 not out of my shoes context irritating shares are now also of which 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.160
 just play again just tell 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.990
 I can not let go it is like but when my son play young nec 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.770
 I am myself 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.210
 and this is also a little way of ommen and 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.480
 how to make greater loss 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.530
 I am you when you look at those hanging eyelids I have it a small 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:06.810
 bit too 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.380
 the whole after that they could go on being real 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.650
 hang out 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.650
 but in this way you can take a crisis 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.200
 but I'm going to show the extreme 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.190
 this is percent 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.290
 certain types of films 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.290
 18 PSV also often 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.590
 but well there he asked 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.310
 he knew that 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.920
 purely for skiing may go outside I am not going outside of critical condition anymore 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.400
 I am ahead of you is a song 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.770
 use the mac only because of colors 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.770
 so if you have one then you can join in with exactly the same clothes and different 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.940
 just use your own projects 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.770
 no I will first receive guidance 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.219
 I just don't use them 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:53.219
 london anp 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.440
 and i start in in a strong block 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.440
 and then I grab a very light handle this 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:11.419
 and what they are going to do 

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:13.469
 raised on balance 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:15.269
 on the Rhine 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.699
 normally you are ready slightly higher than normal 

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:21.699
 the stroke 

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:25.229
 I can hardly 

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:28.229
 and that will be a very nice preserve the tour de ice 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:33.940
 I wrote that I am 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.920
 and better camera because 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.109
 You see you can do a good cause 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:42.109
 I now use the working of the plugs 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.389
 but I really want to really make real camera surveillance 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:50.389
 to set up a beautiful country 

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:54.529
 and I also find a place for habitation afterwards 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.189
 please note this 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:02.189
 to apply the best high 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:08.149
 however, overly high 

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:11.629
 normally it is planned up to here but me 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.629
 add the colors here too 

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:18.249
 the other side 

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:25.979
 this is all 

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:27.529
 both rooms broadcast 

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:33.040
 comes out the most and that is that x above is not going to make you either 

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:35.559
 go up emmen so fit for needed 

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:38.869
 and then use in this does not come out 

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:42.069
 but now I'm not going to use it for the eye shadow colors 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.489
 and grab a dark color comes for black riding cancer I go dark purple 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.489
 rather go danish 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.299
 nine of the dark doors the corniche color 

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:55.969
 and I'm going to make you happy with my knees around me 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:12.689
 Jan 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:27.270
 you draw is as it were and 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.270
 a bit to the colors 

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:35.960
 then you can't have it 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.089
 are you going to blur this up with the same brush 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.740
 do not watch you we put on 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.340
 close as value 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:27.089
 and that's no fun if it's still nicer head thursday 

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:30.149
 that is on the street to get some correction 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:37.469
 3 

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:39.039
 and started crying 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:43.590
 cm it looks like my knee stark cane it might look better on my own 

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:44.939
 theatrical 

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:47.349
 and now I understand 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:49.800
 with my leg x 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.439
 in a class in the hair to inter 

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:53.680
 I still go 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.680
 add extra and take the train at the same time 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:01.770
 and the point is that the 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.099
 Getting the canteen from tight to the ball is well planned 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.300
 and not to forget to bring a higher level 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.740
 I go that color 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.740
 here 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.300
 i'm going to koch pencil and mascara to add that 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.300
 I use a thick black that is for this 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:27.210
 it is funny because it seems as if my chance to take this is actually us 

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:28.319
 take 

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:32.719
 and to participate in each other and the audience to make it all the stones 

00:07:32.719 --> 00:07:35.909
 and the room I did not like 

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:38.289
 and have fun playing bye
