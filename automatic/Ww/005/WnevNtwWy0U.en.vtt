 so come on 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:54.320
 I got a white box like that. 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:56.479
 white and paste the sticker has this deviation 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.600
 called tea bar which I had not 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:03.170
 found was the husband she met and 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:07.970
 has this one also written tea from 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:10.820
 pot is among others have also must 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.670
 have others what tea is but 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.620
 so here only that we found I 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.720
 I bought this one and found this 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.920
 I quite liked it because I have 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:25.370
 since even a tea bar or a mother 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.770
 so you pick up the sticker here and 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.580
 you can write 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:36.590
 if the law Jose was boring all day 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:38.030
 12 of the set and this other box here does not 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.730
 have somewhere to write 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.430
 Forgiveness is the one here, there's no where 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:47.480
 write so when I do not have 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.730
 write what I did I got it with prayers 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.360
 it's just a little poster inside these 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.150
 Tea souvenirs too that you 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:00.410
 you can enter the couple's name and date 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:04.280
 I did it like that back here. 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.640
 so like I did I opened the box and 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.040
 I put it here 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:16.510
 because the intention is that within the 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:20.980
 box stay like this, go inside 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.540
 the box goes mm mm is not a 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:28.570
 in here, that's why 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:32.950
 I put it that way so let's stay in 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:39.630
 That acrylic box is in no way going 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:39.630
 put the adhesive of your choice and 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:48.500
 any one button that is 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:52.920
 very cute here what to absorb and you 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:55.400
 This is a tomato pineapple that is in the 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.400
 my hand 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:07.410
 has strawberry strawberry the grape cut has 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:12.569
 A milkshake cup I also found 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:13.590
 super cool and there are roses, which is a 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:18.720
 rosinha 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:21.290
 okay is to catch hot glue here is to put 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.290
 hot 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.110
 will put a little here on the button 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:40.230
 and it will put here it impresses 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:51.020
 waiting to dry there is the bulletin 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:06.960
 good not to make the handle box chooses the 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.960
 button psd will act 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:16.479
 the bullet 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:23.779
 I'm a little bit right presses a 

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:26.199
 here he could stay and he 

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:26.199
 stays like this 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:34.320
 so I've done a lot of listening to the 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:41.440
 camera will turn gives a peek horne 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:45.780
 I did humans too did enough to do 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.780
 most do just one more 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.940
 ae 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:04.229
 he is very cute that he is a 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:04.229
 little sorbet 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:13.350
