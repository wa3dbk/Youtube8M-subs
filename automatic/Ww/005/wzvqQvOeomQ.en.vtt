this<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.810> first<00:00:31.170> that<00:00:31.320> we've<00:00:31.439> seen<00:00:31.679> the

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
this is the first that we've seen the

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.180 
this is the first that we've seen the
new<00:00:32.040> gundalian<00:00:32.669> invaders<00:00:32.759> deca<00:00:33.420> balls<00:00:33.750> and

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
new gundalian invaders deca balls and

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.979 
new gundalian invaders deca balls and
they<00:00:35.190> are<00:00:35.489> massive<00:00:35.850> almost<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.480> size<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.899> a

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
they are massive almost the size of a

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.350 
they are massive almost the size of a
softball<00:00:37.280> you<00:00:38.280> flip<00:00:38.670> over<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.000> back<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.300> the

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
softball you flip over the back of the

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.450 
softball you flip over the back of the
packaging<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.770> can<00:00:40.920> see<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.309> does

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
packaging and you can see that it does

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.819 
packaging and you can see that it does
actually<00:00:41.670> come<00:00:41.820> with<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.180> DNA<00:00:42.809> code<00:00:43.110> or<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.530> back

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
actually come with a DNA code or a back

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.590 
actually come with a DNA code or a back
you<00:00:43.980> coin<00:00:44.219> code<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.820> can<00:00:44.910> redeem<00:00:45.149> online

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
you coin code that you can redeem online

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.630 
you coin code that you can redeem online
and<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.260> says<00:00:46.410> redeem<00:00:46.710> for<00:00:46.920> an<00:00:46.980> online<00:00:47.219> value

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
and it says redeem for an online value

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.180 
and it says redeem for an online value
so<00:00:47.879> we're<00:00:48.030> not<00:00:48.180> sure<00:00:48.239> what<00:00:49.200> that<00:00:49.350> online<00:00:49.559> value

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
so we're not sure what that online value

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.430 
so we're not sure what that online value
is<00:00:50.370> yet<00:00:50.670> what<00:00:51.329> its<00:00:51.480> gonna<00:00:51.539> be<00:00:51.840> because<00:00:52.320> the

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
is yet what its gonna be because the

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.670 
is yet what its gonna be because the

let's open this up okay here we have

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.740 
let's open this up okay here we have
have<00:01:31.770> him<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.220> this<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.759> Pyrus<00:01:33.450> helix

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
have him so this is Pyrus helix

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.410 
have him so this is Pyrus helix
Dragonoid<00:01:34.009> nice<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.250> heavy<00:01:35.430> good<00:01:35.909> feeling<00:01:36.329> to

the ball I think the smaller balls have
gotten<00:01:38.280> better<00:01:38.400> with<00:01:38.729> each<00:01:39.180> season<00:01:39.509> in<00:01:39.869> series

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259

Bakugan<00:03:15.199> and<00:03:15.560> it<00:03:16.250> looks<00:03:16.459> like<00:03:16.519> he<00:03:16.819> is<00:03:16.969> a<00:03:17.379> 750<00:03:18.379> G

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
Bakugan and it looks like he is a 750 G

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.550 
Bakugan and it looks like he is a 750 G
so<00:03:20.530> pretty<00:03:21.530> epic<00:03:21.709> looking<00:03:22.250> I<00:03:23.239> wonder<00:03:24.199> if<00:03:24.379> we

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
so pretty epic looking I wonder if we

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.369 
so pretty epic looking I wonder if we
put<00:03:24.799> a<00:03:24.949> regular<00:03:25.430> helix<00:03:25.939> Dragonoid<00:03:26.689> next<00:03:27.319> to

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:27.379 
put a regular helix Dragonoid next to

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:29.559 
put a regular helix Dragonoid next to
this<00:03:27.500> guy<00:03:27.739> the<00:03:28.430> size<00:03:28.669> difference<00:03:29.209> would<00:03:29.389> be

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
this guy the size difference would be

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.530 
this guy the size difference would be
massive<00:03:29.870> and<00:03:31.000> maybe<00:03:32.000> we'll<00:03:32.090> do<00:03:32.180> that<00:03:32.209> for<00:03:32.479> our

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
massive and maybe we'll do that for our

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.240 
massive and maybe we'll do that for our
next<00:03:32.569> video<00:03:32.870> when<00:03:33.199> we<00:03:33.229> review<00:03:33.739> his<00:03:33.919> battle
