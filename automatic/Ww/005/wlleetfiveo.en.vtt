home so and believe it or not there's
actually<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.290> lot<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.620> science<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.190> goes<00:00:35.250> into

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
actually a lot of science that goes into

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.000 
actually a lot of science that goes into
how<00:00:36.000> grocery<00:00:36.480> stores<00:00:36.809> are<00:00:36.960> laid<00:00:37.200> out<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.680> how

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
mindlessly will will actually purchase

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.720 
mindlessly will will actually purchase
these<00:00:43.379> foods<00:00:43.710> because<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.370> different

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
these foods because of the different

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.220 
these foods because of the different
colors<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.300> because<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.780> actually<00:00:46.110> where

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
colors and because of actually where

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.930 
colors and because of actually where
they're<00:00:46.410> placed<00:00:46.649> on<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.920> shelves<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:47.520> you

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
they're placed on the shelves and so you

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.580 
they're placed on the shelves and so you
know<00:00:48.030> there's<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.450> lot<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.719> time<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.410> lot<00:00:49.440> of

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
know there's a lot of time and a lot of

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.229 
know there's a lot of time and a lot of
money<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.070> lot<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.250> science<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:51.000> goes

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
money and a lot of science that goes

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.760 
money and a lot of science that goes
into<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.690> way<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:52.050> these<00:00:52.170> stores<00:00:52.440> are<00:00:52.559> laid

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
into the way that these stores are laid

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.889 
into the way that these stores are laid
out<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:53.160> make<00:00:53.370> us<00:00:53.579> buy<00:00:53.850> foods<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.360> we<00:00:54.539> really

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
out to make us buy foods that we really

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.020 
out to make us buy foods that we really
don't<00:00:55.020> want<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.379> buy<00:00:55.550> so<00:00:56.550> what<00:00:56.879> are<00:00:56.910> some

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
don't want to buy so what are some

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.790 
don't want to buy so what are some
tactics<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.600> we<00:00:57.719> can<00:00:57.899> use<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.260> know<00:00:58.289> when

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
tactics that we can use you know when
