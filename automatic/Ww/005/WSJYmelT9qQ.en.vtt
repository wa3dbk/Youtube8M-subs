in<00:03:10.890> a<00:03:10.950> combo<00:03:11.459> I<00:03:12.500> guess<00:03:13.500> you<00:03:13.650> could<00:03:13.680> it<00:03:13.980> would

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
in a combo I guess you could it would

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.350 
in a combo I guess you could it would
knock<00:03:14.220> you<00:03:14.370> away<00:03:14.579> so<00:03:14.640> it's<00:03:14.940> probably<00:03:15.120> not<00:03:15.329> very

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
knock you away so it's probably not very

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.379
