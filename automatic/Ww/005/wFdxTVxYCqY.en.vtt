section<00:02:50.400> left<00:02:50.910> of<00:02:51.150> course<00:02:51.330> i<00:02:51.600> am<00:02:52.670> now<00:02:53.670> actually

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
section left of course i am now actually

I'm I've wet it but I'm finger

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.770 
I'm I've wet it but I'm finger
detangling<00:02:56.160> a<00:02:56.370> lot<00:02:56.580> more<00:02:56.910> at<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.330> front<00:02:57.570> of<00:02:57.630> my

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
detangling a lot more at the front of my

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.460 
detangling a lot more at the front of my
hair<00:02:58.020> um<00:02:58.770> as<00:02:59.010> I<00:02:59.820> continue<00:03:00.570> to<00:03:00.630> do<00:03:00.930> my<00:03:01.110> hair<00:03:01.410> and

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
hair um as I continue to do my hair and

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.170 
hair um as I continue to do my hair and
as<00:03:01.800> you<00:03:01.950> can<00:03:02.070> see<00:03:02.100> I'm<00:03:02.280> just<00:03:02.489> repeating<00:03:02.880> those

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
as you can see I'm just repeating those

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.330 
as you can see I'm just repeating those
steps<00:03:03.480> again<00:03:03.810> with<00:03:04.110> a<00:03:04.140> curl<00:03:04.410> wig<00:03:04.650> of<00:03:04.770> spray<00:03:05.040> um

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
steps again with a curl wig of spray um

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.460 
steps again with a curl wig of spray um
I<00:03:05.970> I<00:03:06.660> sort<00:03:07.440> of<00:03:07.560> figure<00:03:08.010> out<00:03:08.040> better<00:03:09.470> strategies

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
I I sort of figure out better strategies

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.530 
I I sort of figure out better strategies
by<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:10.800> time<00:03:11.010> I<00:03:11.040> get<00:03:11.250> up<00:03:11.310> to<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:12.060> front<00:03:12.239> of<00:03:12.420> my

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
by the time I get up to the front of my

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.790 
by the time I get up to the front of my
hair<00:03:12.810> might<00:03:13.050> this<00:03:13.170> works<00:03:13.470> a<00:03:13.560> little<00:03:13.650> bit

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
hair might this works a little bit

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.560 
hair might this works a little bit
better<00:03:14.010> so<00:03:14.550> that's<00:03:14.670> why<00:03:14.880> sometimes<00:03:15.180> it

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
better so that's why sometimes it

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.300 
better so that's why sometimes it
changes<00:03:15.600> slightly<00:03:16.290> and<00:03:16.860> as<00:03:17.010> you<00:03:17.130> can<00:03:17.280> see

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
changes slightly and as you can see

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.550 
changes slightly and as you can see
instead<00:03:17.790> of<00:03:17.910> using<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.270> hobo<00:03:18.690> oil<00:03:18.870> I<00:03:19.140> switched

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
instead of using the hobo oil I switched

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.229 
instead of using the hobo oil I switched
to<00:03:19.680> coconut<00:03:20.160> oil<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:20.640> now<00:03:20.820> I'm<00:03:20.970> putting<00:03:21.060> the

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
to coconut oil and now I'm putting the

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.479 
to coconut oil and now I'm putting the
aloe<00:03:21.420> vera<00:03:21.720> gel<00:03:21.959> on<00:03:22.200> top<00:03:22.440> of<00:03:22.620> that<00:03:22.769> or<00:03:23.070> you<00:03:23.340> can

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
aloe vera gel on top of that or you can

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.610 
aloe vera gel on top of that or you can
put<00:03:23.580> the<00:03:23.700> oil<00:03:23.820> on<00:03:24.030> last<00:03:24.300> like<00:03:24.630> really<00:03:25.140> it<00:03:25.320> just

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
put the oil on last like really it just

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.560 
put the oil on last like really it just
depends<00:03:26.160> on<00:03:26.250> what<00:03:26.430> you<00:03:26.519> like<00:03:26.550> and<00:03:27.330> you<00:03:27.450> know

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
depends on what you like and you know

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.930 
depends on what you like and you know
what<00:03:27.750> in<00:03:27.870> retrospect<00:03:28.230> looking<00:03:28.530> back<00:03:29.010> I<00:03:29.310> wish<00:03:29.730> I

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
what in retrospect looking back I wish I

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.729 
what in retrospect looking back I wish I
would<00:03:30.120> have<00:03:30.150> continued<00:03:30.720> with<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:31.019> ho<00:03:31.140> ho<00:03:31.350> boil

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
would have continued with the ho ho boil

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.070 
would have continued with the ho ho boil
because<00:03:31.830> I<00:03:32.010> like<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:32.250> way<00:03:32.580> that<00:03:32.850> the<00:03:33.540> softness

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
because I like the way that the softness

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.560 
because I like the way that the softness
that<00:03:34.350> it<00:03:34.620> gave<00:03:34.800> I'm<00:03:35.190> at<00:03:35.670> least<00:03:35.910> for<00:03:36.450> this

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
that it gave I'm at least for this

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.350 
that it gave I'm at least for this
combination<00:03:37.290> of<00:03:37.530> products<00:03:38.160> but<00:03:38.880> my<00:03:39.060> thinking

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
combination of products but my thinking

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.420 
combination of products but my thinking
in<00:03:39.600> this<00:03:39.750> moment<00:03:39.989> was<00:03:40.320> that<00:03:40.530> coconut<00:03:41.280> oil

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
in this moment was that coconut oil

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.660 
in this moment was that coconut oil
usually<00:03:41.850> holds<00:03:42.239> a<00:03:42.330> little<00:03:42.630> bit<00:03:43.340> better<00:03:44.340> and

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
usually holds a little bit better and

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.930 
usually holds a little bit better and
colder

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
colder

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.930 
colder
climate<00:03:46.570> it<00:03:46.750> holds<00:03:47.140> texture<00:03:47.740> better<00:03:48.130> and<00:03:48.490> of

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
climate it holds texture better and of

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.640 
climate it holds texture better and of
course<00:03:48.970> at<00:03:49.360> the<00:03:49.480> end<00:03:49.630> here<00:03:50.140> i'm<00:03:50.230> using<00:03:50.290> aloe

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
course at the end here i'm using aloe

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.880 
course at the end here i'm using aloe
vera<00:03:50.920> gel<00:03:51.130> to<00:03:51.430> create<00:03:51.850> that<00:03:51.970> nice<00:03:52.180> little<00:03:52.450> girl

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
vera gel to create that nice little girl

00:03:52.890 --> 00:04:00.180
