this<00:00:01.709> is<00:00:02.010> the<00:00:02.340> Silicon<00:00:02.909> Graphics<00:00:03.110> iris<00:00:04.110> indigo

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
this is the Silicon Graphics iris indigo

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.900 
this is the Silicon Graphics iris indigo
system<00:00:05.040> I'm<00:00:05.819> just<00:00:05.970> going<00:00:06.089> to<00:00:06.180> do<00:00:06.240> a<00:00:06.270> quick

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:07.910 
system I'm just going to do a quick

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.549 
system I'm just going to do a quick
teardown<00:00:08.910> of<00:00:09.179> it<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.450> then<00:00:09.599> I'll<00:00:09.809> hook<00:00:10.320> it<00:00:10.440> up

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
teardown of it and then I'll hook it up

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.150 
teardown of it and then I'll hook it up
to<00:00:10.969> monitor<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.179> show<00:00:12.990> you<00:00:13.049> how<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:13.950> boots<00:00:14.130> up

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
to monitor and show you how it boots up

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.620 
to monitor and show you how it boots up
the<00:00:17.160> front<00:00:17.369> panel<00:00:17.699> comes<00:00:17.910> up<00:00:18.060> relatively<00:00:18.390> easy

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
the front panel comes up relatively easy

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.410 
the front panel comes up relatively easy
so<00:00:18.960> there's<00:00:19.109> no<00:00:19.230> point<00:00:19.500> showing<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:20.420> just

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
so there's no point showing that just

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.970 
so there's no point showing that just
twist<00:00:21.900> this<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.890> get<00:00:23.010> access<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:24.980> main

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
twist this to get access to the main

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:48.790 
twist this to get access to the main
cards

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.750 

this<00:00:49.399> is<00:00:49.700> the<00:00:49.879> main<00:00:50.120> CPU<00:00:50.570> card<00:00:51.140> and<00:00:51.379> has<00:00:52.280> all<00:00:52.730> of

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
this is the main CPU card and has all of

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.240 
this is the main CPU card and has all of
the<00:00:53.540> RAM<00:00:53.960> as<00:00:54.200> well<00:00:54.470> and<00:00:54.879> it<00:00:55.879> just<00:00:56.090> slides<00:00:56.360> into

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
the RAM as well and it just slides into

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.580 
the RAM as well and it just slides into
that<00:00:58.250> slot<00:00:58.550> there<00:00:58.850> and<00:00:59.199> this<00:01:00.199> is<00:01:00.260> also

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
that slot there and this is also

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.729 
that slot there and this is also
upgradable<00:01:01.550> you<00:01:01.699> can<00:01:01.879> get<00:01:02.090> faster<00:01:02.750> CPU<00:01:03.320> cards

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
upgradable you can get faster CPU cards

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.390 
upgradable you can get faster CPU cards
that<00:01:04.040> go<00:01:04.250> into<00:01:04.460> into<00:01:05.360> this<00:01:05.479> system<00:01:06.100> stock<00:01:07.100> this

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
that go into into this system stock this

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.690 
that go into into this system stock this
is<00:01:07.610> generally<00:01:08.150> at<00:01:08.360> 25<00:01:08.960> or<00:01:09.070> 33<00:01:10.070> megahertz<00:01:10.390> CPU

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
is generally at 25 or 33 megahertz CPU

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.310 
is generally at 25 or 33 megahertz CPU
you<00:01:13.700> can<00:01:13.820> actually<00:01:14.000> see<00:01:14.360> right<00:01:14.390> there<00:01:14.780> this<00:01:15.020> is

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
you can actually see right there this is

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.820 
you can actually see right there this is
the<00:01:15.590> our<00:01:16.030> 3000<00:01:17.030> a<00:01:17.300> version<00:01:17.780> of<00:01:17.990> the<00:01:18.140> CPU<00:01:18.350> and

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
the our 3000 a version of the CPU and

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.719 
the our 3000 a version of the CPU and
you<00:01:19.430> can<00:01:19.580> also<00:01:19.729> see<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:20.410> 33<00:01:21.460> speed<00:01:22.460> is

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
you can also see the 33 speed is

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.650 
you can also see the 33 speed is
indicated<00:01:23.240> right<00:01:23.420> on<00:01:23.539> there<00:01:25.060> this<00:01:26.060> particular
