what<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.619> like<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.979> do<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.159> think<00:01:26.460> looks<00:01:26.850> really

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
what I like to do I think looks really

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.770 
what I like to do I think looks really
nice<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.720> if<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.770> shut<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.700> when<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.540> clock

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
nice is if you shut it when the clock

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.090 
nice is if you shut it when the clock
mode<00:01:31.020> comes<00:01:31.350> on<00:01:32.900> if<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:34.110> just<00:01:34.320> leave<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.619> I

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
mode comes on if you just leave that I

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.830 
mode comes on if you just leave that I
actually<00:01:35.520> use<00:01:35.939> this<00:01:36.090> as<00:01:36.270> an<00:01:36.360> alarm<00:01:36.630> clock

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
actually use this as an alarm clock

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.920 
actually use this as an alarm clock
sometimes<00:01:37.439> just<00:01:38.310> leave<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.640> there<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.060> as<00:01:39.900> you

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
sometimes just leave it there and as you

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.859 
sometimes just leave it there and as you
can<00:01:40.110> see<00:01:40.970> the<00:01:41.970> brightness<00:01:43.070> the<00:01:44.600> it<00:01:45.600> shows<00:01:45.840> a

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
can see the brightness the it shows a

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.770 
can see the brightness the it shows a
little<00:01:46.110> analog<00:01:46.619> clock<00:01:47.009> with<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.310> nice

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
little analog clock with a nice

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.929 
little analog clock with a nice
animation<00:01:48.799> so<00:01:49.799> that's<00:01:50.009> just<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.280> quick<00:01:50.430> look<00:01:50.729> on

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
animation so that's just a quick look on

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.050 
animation so that's just a quick look on
the<00:01:51.030> dock<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.810> looks<00:01:52.170> really<00:01:52.470> nice<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:53.280> I

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
the dock it looks really nice and I

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.190 
the dock it looks really nice and I
think<00:01:54.930> it's<00:01:55.020> about<00:01:55.079> $30<00:01:55.979> maybe<00:01:56.909> 40s<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:57.869> if<00:01:58.079> you

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
think it's about $30 maybe 40s so if you

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.480 
think it's about $30 maybe 40s so if you
guys<00:01:58.350> want<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.829> convenience<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.430> just

guys want the convenience of just

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.630 
guys want the convenience of just
putting<00:01:59.909> in<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.240> in<00:02:00.659> on<00:02:01.170> your<00:02:01.200> desk<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.829> I'm
