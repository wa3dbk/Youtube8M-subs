00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.439
 as many you have been a few days 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.040
 disconnected from the world of legends 

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:11.960
 disconnected from what the sun wanted to do 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.900
 it's all been because I've been working 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.360
 very hard to become a challenger in 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.680
 this video I want to give you the tricks for 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.240
 to become challenges the tricks that 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.620
 no one else has ever said never give me a 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.450
 little scary about this video because 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.060
 I am threatened with death by rivers me 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.160
 I contacted, they told me not to do that 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.079
 because it is one of the best secrets 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.670
 saved that they have better 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.050
 saved that they have but I do not 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.640
 they scare me 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.320
 I know that youtubers have disappeared I know that 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.440
 there have been deaths related to this 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.579
 but to me the truth gives me quite the same 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.079
 I have commented to see and the only one 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.360
 fruit manage to be two man said that by 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.740
 please do not do it 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.720
 to be a brave and I'm going to do it 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.880
 the disposable advantages are many 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.710
 very many very many for example when 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.720
 We will buy at the door always 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.040
 you have a person is a person who 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.900
 you will give the shopping list and go to 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.730
 make the purchase for you when you go 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.890
 to buy bread in three lights of bread 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.380
 send your mother buy the bread when 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.080
 enter you will notice that people are silent and 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.760
 a silence like a little uncomfortable but 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.640
 they will let it brew to carry the bread 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.340
 free when you have meetings 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.690
 family going down the stairs if 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.240
 live a house or entering the 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.430
 room if you live in a flat is going to 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.020
 go out to sound an epic background music of 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.940
 hit we do not know I do not know where that comes from 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.500
 own music I hear it people are 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.450
 is silent, he bows to me 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.130
 all my relatives and I feel in the 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.210
 table to eat until I start to see 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.100
 nobody starts 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.940
 you can not talk to someone less than 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.710
 platinum 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.810
 you can not directly you can not 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.390
 impossible there is no such people for you 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.690
 it's like a kind of god and it's the creator 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.400
 of all of them you can not 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.500
 how are we going to look for a job without going 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.870
 far people in the curriculum because 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.420
 when the interviewer arrives aside 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.610
 of the challenger will say if he asked for a 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.460
 photo next to the photo please a 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.960
 challenger frame that is to say knows and does not 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.280
 they will catch you because they are afraid that you 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.960
 take off the post is afraid that you 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.240
 Take to the street how you become more 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.399
 important that he is a bit dangerous 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.920
 this video but I think it will be worth the 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.350
 grief so very attentive guys took 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.720
 notes because it is very complicated going to 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.830
 be an intense video the truth that I think 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.470
 which of the most intense I've done 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.970
 never 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.010
 well let's go to it 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.260
 we're here, guys, I'm going to show you 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.670
 the key to becoming a challenger is 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.590
 a little complicated I do not know if I'm going to 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.060
 get but if I really get it 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.470
 guys that will be very good for 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.970
 you because you go so when doing 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.560
 challenger and you are going to be able to miss 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.690
 all sides and you will have all the 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.240
 benefits that I've told you before first 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.370
 of all the most basic if you do not know 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.940
 do these months in challenger you have 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.520
 to open the lol launcher 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.690
 when you arrive you go to your profile which is 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.400
 up here I'll have to know too 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.360
 if you can not do this tutorial if not 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.850
 you know these things 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.130
 we open cuts we make a new 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.540
 cut before interested being tested 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.220
 floating you have seen have been tests 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.420
 what have you tried to do to make everything 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.990
 will look good and in the end it seems that what 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.600
 got 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:07.180
 we cut all blog launcher 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.280
 this is complicated is very complicated is 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.710
 one of the critical points because if 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.560
 we fail now everything can go to the 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.690
 caretera when we have tubes lunches 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.520
 of lol that we see problems not 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.020
 let's save with our name what 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.950
 we put on the desk and we're going to 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.950
 call Ã¡lex 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.710
 after this we return the launcher of 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.570
 role and we're going to look for a challenger 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.130
 anyone a little bit bad 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.840
 reckless for example that's pretty 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.110
 bad the truth pretty good price of 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.540
 I will not I will cheat and will equal 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.640
 that before making the same cut without 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.980
 no kind of change the same 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.140
 same trim as it is here and as it is 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.220
 perfect we have not failed here 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.900
 I was afraid of failing but we have 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.140
 achieved we have achieved a lot to the 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.850
 first let's save here arrange 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.620
 on the desktop and then we're going to open 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.610
 the original photoshop that I have 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.610
 because my original 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:03.099
 and we're going to open all of our first 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.099
 I find it 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:09.170
 we are seeing on the screen right now 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:11.060
 we have our classification sheet 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.820
 our statistics is very important 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.340
 this after this we open the 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.340
 our challenger that is pretty bad 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.870
 the truth is that I do not 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.480
 finally convinced is pretty bad and 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.070
 now the key part comes the first 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.010
 key part to come the two parties 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.540
 consecutive keys is worth everything first 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.820
 we have to do something very difficult for 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.610
 please with me left button on the 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.070
 photo and we quickly change and put 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.600
 over and fit we have achieved 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.520
 the portion very well then now I do not 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.770
 I would really get 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.350
 after this we take the second 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.910
 photoshop option and let's search 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.720
 all the names that we do not want that 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.030
 appear in our 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.710
 in our statistics sheet because 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.570
 they deserve us are people who are there 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.460
 Well, because they do not deserve it 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.990
 they are just there and we deserve it 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.080
 we simply select the name 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:04.080
 Control xy appears that the name 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.090
 it really deserves to be there as you are 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.990
 checking these are the names that you 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.670
 they deserve to be there 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.250
 this is challenger i am challenger a 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:13.350
 from now on and after this 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.360
 how are we like a 6 real gods 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.990
 we are a kind of gods we keep 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:21.180
 as the desk we put salt in being 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.790
 we are gods as I said we have 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.370
 png jpg option i not only saves on 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.420
 jpg since now we have this has 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.950
 to be in all social networks 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.460
 that we manage an average quality is 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.770
 all right 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.780
 so we keep it on the desk and 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.490
 you have not saved in the desk we 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.050
 we go to social networks since this 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.060
 it has to be in each and every one of 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.039
 social networks we manage 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.860
 after so much both work 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:46.690
 it's worth it for people to know 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.460
 Once we have reached social networks 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.870
 for example twitter we have to say 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.060
 that we are Jennifer, it is necessary to say 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.560
 mandatory but the states subscribed 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:58.180
 otherwise we would not have benefits 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.180
 finally after a long work 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.510
 I got it 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.840
 challenger 

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:18.589
 and we love you this is mandatory 

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:20.149
 this is obligatory if we do not do this 

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:23.509
 they really never distract themselves from ever doing 

00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:24.289
 you have to negotiate, you have to go to 

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:25.939
 coat 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:27.259
 you can not say that you are means of 

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:28.969
 charlene helmut have to know 

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:33.789
 you have to laugh at the men of 

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:33.789
 butchering is mandatory 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.840
 after following these steps have 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.360
 come to salinger 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:43.270
 trying to call your father 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:45.760
 mother your brother and tell him if he is not 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:47.770
 platinum that as of today you are 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.020
 challenger you already have to talk to 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.460
 You can not send a respect to them 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.440
 superior to them 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.210
 you are something above them we do not 

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.500
 you can send from now on me 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:59.050
 they do not send me anymore and I do what I want 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:01.270
 that I get up at 12 I play the role more 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:03.580
 Challenger did not stop signing autographs 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:06.850
 down the street really worth a lot 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:08.370
 worth doing are five simple steps 

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:11.919
 It's done in a moment and it's really worth it 

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:14.110
 so good we're going to feel a noise 

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:16.389
 hear a noise I think it's the door 

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:19.969
 and they are steps that go up here 

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:23.599
 so I'm going to see who it is now I come 

00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:27.969
 has this riot as more found 

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:27.969
 yachts with that no no no no 

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:36.050
 Now, seriously, I liked this one 

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:37.610
 video this joke that I have made I do not get 

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:40.039
 well it's all talk seriously I just 

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:41.059
 to realize that I have seen again and I do not know
