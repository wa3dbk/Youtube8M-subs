00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 without a house project we do not build it 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.319
 due to the fact that any construction 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.349
 should be built on the project well, should not 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.049
 built a finger poked into the sky I want that 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.120
 does not know what exactly in the project immediately on 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.949
 the design stage a person gives us 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.869
 terms of reference specifications 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.510
 to which the house is designed according to its 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.160
 wishes considering how he will walk there 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.080
 how he will be comfortable furniture installation 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.880
 do on the basis of this sketch 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.099
 project is already done working project and 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.380
 every bolt every screw 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.989
 width of the opening all this is taken into account height 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.760
 and you get the whole look of the house 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.040
 there is a person already has a visual 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.750
 representation of what he gets without 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.239
 project to build by no means 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.030
 it is impossible therefore we do not build without projects 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.890
 if the person has already received the exact price 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.079
 as accurate as possible but there is no 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.300
 project, it says that there he is not 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.219
 get the expected result price can 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.530
 say roughly about without 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.090
 project for example how are we 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.949
 23,000 this size from twenty to 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.640
 twenty five depending on your 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.680
 wishes 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.510
 and if people ask the question how much will 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.630
 cost six to six house 2 floors 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.340
 here it is impossible to answer such a question if 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.380
 the firm gives the exact answer to this question 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.270
 what does it mean to think about because 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.380
 the material may be different, the same 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.479
 roofing can be used 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.479
 slate metal shingles 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.610
 there ondulin the same windows can be taken 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.680
 plastic economy options plastic 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.200
 There vi class can be wooden 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.689
 I do not want to apply there I want one light bulb 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.119
 10 spotlights don't want cheap 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.610
 Salin I want expensive there imitation timber 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.560
 under the tree it all increases the price all 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.630
 customer wishes are not all recorded 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.520
 increases by not because it's us 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.979
 here have said so and this price 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.930
 because there is a list which is clear 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.880
 reasonably clear and understandable on the shelves 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.220
 food laid out in humans have not asked these 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.290
 questions and say right away the exact price but 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.460
 then we think about it 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.380
 constantly face two 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.720
 categories of people someone constantly 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.820
 just looks at the price and someone says 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.280
 I normally build everything 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.040
 here everyone has a choice either he is chasing 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.990
 for the price and get what gets either 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.329
 man needs a quality home after all 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.640
 build a house it's about one and a half to 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.590
 three million worth is money that 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.600
 the menu should not be scattered and this 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.700
 marginally saving which person 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.069
 can get 100,000 compared to 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.290
 the whole house is not the one 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.700
 indicators to infringe upon themselves 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.180
 quality there reliability in operation 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.890
 houses need to build quality houses 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.230
 normal companies at acceptable 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.420
 cost is not at a low but at an acceptable 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.030
 that is, an acceptable cost may be 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.420
 only with the observance of all the qualities of all 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.190
 norms of all rules and all materials 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.660
 it is impossible to build from cheap materials 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.660
 normal quality
