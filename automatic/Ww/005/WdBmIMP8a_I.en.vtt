this<00:00:04.920> is<00:00:05.130> a<00:00:05.160> quick<00:00:05.640> video<00:00:05.850> of<00:00:06.260> pc-bsd<00:00:07.260> 9<00:00:08.010> beta<00:00:08.400> 2

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
this is a quick video of pc-bsd 9 beta 2

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.810 
this is a quick video of pc-bsd 9 beta 2
booting<00:00:09.210> on<00:00:09.420> an<00:00:10.170> i7<00:00:10.530> box<00:00:13.160> lots<00:00:14.160> of<00:00:14.400> beefy

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
booting on an i7 box lots of beefy

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.330 
booting on an i7 box lots of beefy
hardware<00:00:15.299> so<00:00:16.170> let's<00:00:16.349> go<00:00:16.500> ahead<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:16.710> fire<00:00:17.160> it

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
hardware so let's go ahead and fire it

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.870 
hardware so let's go ahead and fire it
up<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:18.529> we<00:00:19.529> should<00:00:19.680> see<00:00:19.829> the<00:00:19.919> post<00:00:20.220> screen

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
up and we should see the post screen

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.069 
up and we should see the post screen
shortly<00:00:21.480> there<00:00:21.869> we<00:00:21.989> go<00:00:22.200> and<00:00:23.480> if<00:00:24.480> you<00:00:24.660> saw<00:00:24.899> it

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:25.079 
shortly there we go and if you saw it

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:27.109 
shortly there we go and if you saw it
three<00:00:25.439> point<00:00:25.680> two<00:00:25.800> gigahertz<00:00:26.099> 12<00:00:26.550> gigs<00:00:26.759> of<00:00:26.939> ram

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
three point two gigahertz 12 gigs of ram

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.479 
three point two gigahertz 12 gigs of ram
and<00:00:30.380> if<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.529> wanted<00:00:31.770> to<00:00:31.890> make<00:00:32.040> this<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.220> little

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
and if I wanted to make this a little

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.820 
and if I wanted to make this a little
faster<00:00:32.940> I'd<00:00:33.180> skip<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.600> CD<00:00:34.410> boot<00:00:36.350> but<00:00:37.350> then<00:00:37.560> the

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:37.830 
faster I'd skip the CD boot but then the

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.010 
faster I'd skip the CD boot but then the
bootloader<00:00:38.220> checks<00:00:38.640> every<00:00:39.120> drive<00:00:39.390> for

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
bootloader checks every drive for

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.320 
bootloader checks every drive for
something<00:00:40.470> and<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:41.100> probably<00:00:41.400> related<00:00:41.880> to

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330 
something and is probably related to

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.560 
something and is probably related to
this<00:00:42.570> being<00:00:42.900> a<00:00:43.320> beta<00:00:44.000> it's<00:00:45.000> probably<00:00:45.210> some

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
this being a beta it's probably some

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.740 
this being a beta it's probably some
Diagnostics<00:00:46.350> thing<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:47.520> takes<00:00:47.820> quite<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.480> while

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:01:23.810 

so<00:00:51.750> we'll<00:00:51.870> go<00:00:51.960> ahead<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.140> wait<00:00:52.440> on<00:00:52.470> that

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.270 

this<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.630> actually<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.500> most<00:01:25.800> time-consuming

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
this is actually the most time-consuming

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.190 
this is actually the most time-consuming
part<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:27.300> the<00:01:27.420> boot<00:01:29.780> the<00:01:30.780> drives<00:01:31.050> are

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
part of the boot the drives are

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.370 
part of the boot the drives are
configured<00:01:31.680> for<00:01:31.860> eight<00:01:32.040> HCI<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.380> their

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
configured for eight HCI and their

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.020 
configured for eight HCI and their
10,000<00:01:35.040> RPM<00:01:35.400> velociraptors<00:01:36.390> so<00:01:37.909> shouldn't<00:01:38.909> be

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
10,000 RPM velociraptors so shouldn't be

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.730 
10,000 RPM velociraptors so shouldn't be
anything<00:01:39.240> related<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.990> drive<00:01:40.229> but<00:01:40.530> there

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
anything related to the drive but there

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.900 
anything related to the drive but there
you<00:01:40.860> can<00:01:41.040> see<00:01:41.810> last<00:01:42.810> one<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:43.710> being<00:01:44.460> checked

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
you can see last one is being checked

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.590 
you can see last one is being checked
and<00:01:45.470> will<00:01:46.470> be<00:01:46.680> booting<00:01:47.070> shortly<00:01:47.550> there<00:01:48.240> we<00:01:48.420> go

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
and will be booting shortly there we go

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.300 
and will be booting shortly there we go
just<00:01:49.140> finished<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:50.630> we're<00:01:51.630> going<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.840> get

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
just finished and we're going to get

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.609 
just finished and we're going to get
what<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.430> like<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.940> refer<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.540> as<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.869> unholy

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
what I like to refer to as the unholy

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.790 
what I like to refer to as the unholy
spew<00:01:56.220> shortly<00:01:59.690> first<00:02:00.690> has<00:02:00.899> got<00:02:01.050> to<00:02:01.170> load<00:02:01.380> all

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
the stuff off of / boot which are mostly

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.810 
the stuff off of / boot which are mostly
kernel<00:02:05.460> extensions<00:02:05.910> and<00:02:06.979> /<00:02:07.979> boot<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.429> all<00:02:08.580> on

the<00:02:09.030> first<00:02:09.450> drive<00:02:10.310> but<00:02:11.310> once<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.700> see<00:02:11.910> this

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
the first drive but once you see this

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.780 
the first drive but once you see this
screen<00:02:12.390> it's<00:02:12.840> mounted<00:02:13.380> it<00:02:13.680> or<00:02:14.130> shortly<00:02:14.700> after

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
screen it's mounted it or shortly after

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:24.500 
screen it's mounted it or shortly after
it'll<00:02:15.540> mount<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:16.769> ZFS<00:02:18.110> raid<00:02:19.110> Z<00:02:19.670> volume<00:02:23.510> which

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
it'll mount the ZFS raid Z volume which

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:33.770 
it'll mount the ZFS raid Z volume which
is<00:02:24.840> all<00:02:25.470> four<00:02:25.800> drives<00:02:26.100> and<00:02:27.260> there<00:02:28.260> goes<00:02:32.600> so<00:02:33.600> now

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
is all four drives and there goes so now

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.830 
is all four drives and there goes so now
it's<00:02:34.019> for<00:02:34.290> real<00:02:34.500> loading<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:35.489> this<00:02:36.299> is<00:02:36.570> the

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
it's for real loading and this is the

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.400 
it's for real loading and this is the
unholy<00:02:37.290> spew<00:02:38.390> it<00:02:39.390> kind<00:02:39.720> of<00:02:39.810> looks<00:02:39.989> like<00:02:40.110> its

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
unholy spew it kind of looks like its

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:53.190 
unholy spew it kind of looks like its
enumerated<00:02:41.329> everything

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.770 

um<00:02:54.609> but<00:02:55.609> looking<00:02:55.939> in<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.150> system<00:02:56.450> it<00:02:56.540> doesn't

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
um but looking in the system it doesn't

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:57.970 
um but looking in the system it doesn't
look<00:02:56.870> like<00:02:56.930> it's<00:02:57.200> doing<00:02:57.319> a<00:02:57.469> whole<00:02:57.560> lot<00:02:57.739> of<00:02:57.769> work

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
look like it's doing a whole lot of work

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.949 
look like it's doing a whole lot of work
while<00:02:58.250> it's<00:02:58.400> doing<00:02:58.549> that<00:02:58.700> this<00:02:59.269> looks<00:02:59.659> kind<00:02:59.930> of

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
while it's doing that this looks kind of

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.660 
while it's doing that this looks kind of
like<00:03:00.019> it's<00:03:00.769> waiting<00:03:01.159> on<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.400> frame<00:03:01.640> buffer

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
like it's waiting on the frame buffer

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:10.089 
like it's waiting on the frame buffer
which<00:03:02.329> is<00:03:02.480> kind<00:03:02.719> of<00:03:02.780> funny<00:03:08.439> you<00:03:09.439> can<00:03:09.620> turn<00:03:09.829> on<00:03:10.069> a

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
which is kind of funny you can turn on a

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.449 
which is kind of funny you can turn on a
splash<00:03:10.670> screen<00:03:11.120> which<00:03:11.810> I<00:03:12.049> did<00:03:12.739> after<00:03:12.950> shooting

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.300 

there<00:03:50.670> you<00:03:50.850> have<00:03:51.060> it<00:03:51.830> about<00:03:52.830> three<00:03:53.160> and<00:03:53.190> a<00:03:53.280> half
