00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.149
 hello girls hello everyone what a pleasure it gives me 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.040
 as always to greet you on this occasion 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:10.380
 I'm going to show you a design that makes 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.090
 in my own nails and although I did not have 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.370
 time to record it later I 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.980
 They asked how I did it 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.050
 I'm going to show you through a tip of 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.720
 nail 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.250
 it's very easy to perform we're going to do 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.110
 of account that this smile 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.630
 We will show the step by step 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.630
 first we are going to need our 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.430
 Fully clean nails completely 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.640
 dry and with an enamel base 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.370
 transparent 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.010
 next I use an enamel of 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.989
 visu is number 220 of the collection 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:45.730
 floral is a very red orange color 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.850
 nice we let it dry 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.190
 and we're going to use a type enamel 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.559
 white brush let's place the lines 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.280
 about half of the nail 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:59.250
 depending on how long you have 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.110
 and they're going to be diagonally we're going to 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.320
 make three lines 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:08.520
 in different directions and we leave 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.520
 dry perfectly 

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:14.200
 Then use an enamel with 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.930
 glitter this has silver sparkles 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.790
 with red 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.910
 this gives you a lot of view and it's going to apply 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.740
 only from the first white line 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:28.369
 upwards 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.590
 I put it in this way and not before 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.860
 the lines to know exactly where 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.890
 I'm going to apply these glitters 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:39.010
 and later use another enamel 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.350
 type pink brush if you use this one what 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.580
 I'm going to apply exactly on top of 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.580
 white diagonal lines 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.080
 and let's let it dry perfectly 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.860
 to finish we will use a top 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.600
 coat or a transparent glaze will 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.810
 Give a great shine to our design 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.759
 It looks very nice and I send you a very nice kiss 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.759
 great see you in the next video
