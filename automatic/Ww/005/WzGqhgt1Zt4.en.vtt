and after that just hit back now you can

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.789 
and after that just hit back now you can
send<00:01:12.270> image<00:01:12.600> as<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.750> background<00:01:13.290> though<00:01:13.560> it's

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
send image as the background though it's

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.230 
send image as the background though it's
a<00:01:13.920> stock<00:01:14.159> image<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.790> application

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
a stock image that the application

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.990 
a stock image that the application
provides<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.380> just<00:01:16.619> stay<00:01:16.830> with<00:01:17.100> black<00:01:17.670> and

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
provides so I just stay with black and

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.690 
provides so I just stay with black and
it<00:01:18.180> looks<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.509> lot<00:01:18.630> more<00:01:19.280> effective<00:01:20.280> if<00:01:20.610> you

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
it looks a lot more effective if you

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.730 
it looks a lot more effective if you
just<00:01:20.850> have<00:01:21.030> black<00:01:21.330> as<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.630> background<00:01:21.810> then

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
just have black as the background then

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.530 
just have black as the background then
there's<00:01:22.950> rotation<00:01:23.430> mode<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.850> can<00:01:24.000> adjust<00:01:24.030> it

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
there's rotation mode you can adjust it

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.130 
there's rotation mode you can adjust it
which<00:01:24.960> way<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.229> rotates<00:01:26.720> you<00:01:27.720> can<00:01:27.840> do<00:01:27.960> that

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
which way it rotates you can do that

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.270 
which way it rotates you can do that
though<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.439> don't<00:01:28.590> really<00:01:28.920> notice<00:01:29.070> a

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
though I don't really notice a

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.700 
though I don't really notice a
difference<00:01:29.640> when<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:29.880> do<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.590> because<00:01:31.590> it

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
difference when I do it because it

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.289 
difference when I do it because it
rotates<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.189> all<00:01:32.310> angles<00:01:32.610> when<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:32.759> touch<00:01:32.970> on<00:01:33.150> it

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
rotates in all angles when I touch on it

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.140 
rotates in all angles when I touch on it
and<00:01:33.799> you<00:01:34.799> can<00:01:34.950> adjust<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.340> cube<00:01:35.579> size<00:01:35.759> so

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
and you can adjust the cube size so

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.050 
and you can adjust the cube size so
let's<00:01:36.329> just<00:01:36.720> make<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:36.930> drastically<00:01:37.590> large

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
let's just make it drastically large

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.760 
let's just make it drastically large
okay<00:01:39.060> oh<00:01:39.329> sorry<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.140> can<00:01:40.259> also<00:01:40.380> adjust<00:01:40.560> the

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
okay oh sorry you can also adjust the

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.440 
okay oh sorry you can also adjust the
