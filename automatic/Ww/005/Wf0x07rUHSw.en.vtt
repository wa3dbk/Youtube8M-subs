which<00:03:13.459> is<00:03:13.489> easy<00:03:13.940> to<00:03:14.090> figure<00:03:14.359> out<00:03:14.510> in<00:03:15.109> a<00:03:15.350> short

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
which is easy to figure out in a short

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.440 
which is easy to figure out in a short
period<00:03:15.650> of<00:03:16.069> time<00:03:16.130> it's<00:03:16.549> usually<00:03:16.700> books<00:03:17.209> and

his<00:03:26.060> thing<00:03:26.329> it's<00:03:26.599> definitely<00:03:27.260> better<00:03:27.410> than

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
his thing it's definitely better than

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.319 
his thing it's definitely better than
the<00:03:27.739> davinci<00:03:28.250> code<00:03:28.370> maybe<00:03:28.609> i<00:03:28.940> would<00:03:29.150> say

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
the davinci code maybe i would say

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:31.659 
the davinci code maybe i would say
