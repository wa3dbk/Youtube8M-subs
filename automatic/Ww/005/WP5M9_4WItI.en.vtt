00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
bat I go for that wallbang spot I know

bat I go for that wallbang spot I know
about<00:00:19.970> not<00:00:20.970> successful<00:00:21.600> though<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:22.020> I

to you about how to be better at

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.490 
to you about how to be better at
quickscoping<00:00:26.750> I've<00:00:27.750> considered<00:00:28.109> myself<00:00:28.289> a

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
quickscoping I've considered myself a

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.889 
quickscoping I've considered myself a
good<00:00:28.590> quick<00:00:28.769> scoper<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.720> uh<00:00:31.009> i<00:00:32.009> think<00:00:32.219> i<00:00:32.430> can

good quick scoper and uh i think i can
give<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:33.930> guys<00:00:34.860> some<00:00:35.100> good<00:00:35.370> pointers<00:00:35.760> and

stuff like that and first of all I'll
tell<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.550> my<00:00:41.670> class<00:00:41.879> setup<00:00:42.290> I'm<00:00:43.290> running<00:00:43.620> MSR

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
tell you my class setup I'm running MSR

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.580 
tell you my class setup I'm running MSR
with<00:00:44.460> extended<00:00:45.120> mags<00:00:45.260> realistically<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.440> can

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
with extended mags realistically you can

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.619 
with extended mags realistically you can
use<00:00:46.739> MSR<00:00:47.780> l<00:00:48.780> 118<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:50.270> variet<00:00:51.270> 50<00:00:51.960> caliber<00:00:52.379> and

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
use MSR l 118 a variet 50 caliber and

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.990 
use MSR l 118 a variet 50 caliber and
the<00:00:54.629> as50<00:00:55.140> those<00:00:55.590> are<00:00:55.739> like<00:00:55.920> don't<00:00:56.340> only<00:00:56.640> guns

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
the as50 those are like don't only guns

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.939 
the as50 those are like don't only guns
that<00:00:57.090> are<00:00:57.149> good<00:00:57.360> for<00:00:57.390> quick<00:00:57.690> scoping<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.260> see

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
that are good for quick scoping and see

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.080 
that are good for quick scoping and see
right<00:00:59.129> there<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.309> get<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.579> nice<00:00:59.940> little

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
right there I get a nice little

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.260 
right there I get a nice little
two-piece<00:01:00.510> but<00:01:01.410> those<00:01:01.620> are<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.859> only<00:01:02.270> snipers

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
two-piece but those are the only snipers

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.850 
two-piece but those are the only snipers
that<00:01:03.420> are<00:01:03.539> good<00:01:03.899> for<00:01:03.930> quick<00:01:04.320> scoping<00:01:04.589> because

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
that are good for quick scoping because

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.020 
that are good for quick scoping because
the<00:01:04.979> other<00:01:05.100> ones<00:01:05.309> will<00:01:05.430> get<00:01:05.549> here<00:01:05.700> markers

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
the other ones will get here markers

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.960 
the other ones will get here markers
constantly<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:07.020> can<00:01:07.200> guarantee<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.560> that

quickscoping / no scoping i would use
steady<00:01:30.000> aim<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.500> helps<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.710> especially<00:01:32.340> if

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
guys is to plant n sensitivity that

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.749 
guys is to plant n sensitivity that
makes<00:01:45.840> quick<00:01:46.380> scoping<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:47.009> much<00:01:47.189> easier<00:01:47.369> you

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
makes quick scoping so much easier you

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.480 
makes quick scoping so much easier you
can<00:01:47.909> react<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.450> guys<00:01:48.600> faster<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:49.170> can<00:01:49.200> turn<00:01:49.500> on

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
can react to guys faster you can turn on

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.050 
can react to guys faster you can turn on
guys<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:51.210> can<00:01:51.649> drag<00:01:52.649> scope<00:01:52.950> easier<00:01:53.399> it's<00:01:53.880> just

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
guys you can drag scope easier it's just

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.240 
guys you can drag scope easier it's just
a<00:01:54.090> lot<00:01:54.210> easier<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.799> quickscope<00:01:55.799> in<00:01:55.950> general

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
a lot easier to quickscope in general

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.730 
a lot easier to quickscope in general
and<00:01:56.430> if<00:01:57.420> you're<00:01:57.930> having<00:01:57.960> trouble<00:01:58.259> getting

and if you're having trouble getting

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.709 
and if you're having trouble getting
used<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.130> 10<00:01:59.340> sensitivity<00:01:59.969> I'd<00:02:00.149> recommend

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
used to 10 sensitivity I'd recommend

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.859 
used to 10 sensitivity I'd recommend
buying<00:02:01.110> FPS<00:02:01.979> freeks<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.520> got<00:02:03.360> up<00:02:03.450> here<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.719> these

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
buying FPS freeks I got up here of these

at<00:04:01.260> quickscoping<00:04:01.439> then<00:04:02.220> I'd<00:04:02.970> say<00:04:03.209> it's<00:04:03.359> okay

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
at quickscoping then I'd say it's okay

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.640 
at quickscoping then I'd say it's okay
to<00:04:04.459> mm-hmm<00:04:05.459> I'd<00:04:05.639> say<00:04:05.939> it's<00:04:06.090> okay<00:04:06.299> to<00:04:06.500> like<00:04:07.500> you

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
to mm-hmm I'd say it's okay to like you

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.020 
to mm-hmm I'd say it's okay to like you
know<00:04:07.680> drag<00:04:08.220> scope<00:04:08.519> will<00:04:08.970> not<00:04:09.150> dry<00:04:09.389> so<00:04:09.629> it's

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
know drag scope will not dry so it's

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.839 
know drag scope will not dry so it's
kind<00:04:12.030> of<00:04:12.120> like<00:04:12.180> drag<00:04:12.479> scoping<00:04:12.900> but<00:04:13.829> I<00:04:14.159> don't

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
kind of like drag scoping but I don't

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:16.460 
kind of like drag scoping but I don't
drag<00:04:15.090> scope<00:04:15.299> a<00:04:15.389> whole<00:04:15.569> lot<00:04:15.750> like<00:04:15.989> see<00:04:16.169> that<00:04:16.199> was

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
drag scope a whole lot like see that was

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.949 
drag scope a whole lot like see that was
a<00:04:16.530> nice<00:04:17.269> quick<00:04:18.269> scope<00:04:18.570> there<00:04:18.870> and<00:04:20.180> uh<00:04:21.180> yeah

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
a nice quick scope there and uh yeah

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.719 
a nice quick scope there and uh yeah
drag<00:04:22.260> scoping<00:04:22.710> it's<00:04:23.039> basically<00:04:23.400> when<00:04:23.700> you

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
drag scoping it's basically when you

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.300 
drag scoping it's basically when you
zoom<00:04:24.300> in<00:04:24.539> and<00:04:24.750> you<00:04:25.349> kind<00:04:25.500> of<00:04:25.620> drag<00:04:26.039> to<00:04:26.159> the<00:04:26.190> left

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
zoom in and you kind of drag to the left

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.940 
zoom in and you kind of drag to the left
or

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
or

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.180 
or
the<00:04:27.070> right<00:04:27.280> and<00:04:27.550> then<00:04:28.390> shoot<00:04:28.950> so<00:04:29.950> it's<00:04:30.100> a

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
the right and then shoot so it's a

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.850 
the right and then shoot so it's a
little<00:04:30.400> quick<00:04:30.610> motion<00:04:31.080> it's<00:04:32.080> not<00:04:32.230> hardscoping

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
little quick motion it's not hardscoping

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.280 
little quick motion it's not hardscoping
but<00:04:33.610> hardscoping<00:04:34.060> is<00:04:34.180> ok<00:04:34.510> you<00:04:34.960> don't<00:04:35.050> have<00:04:35.170> to

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
but hardscoping is ok you don't have to

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:36.930 
but hardscoping is ok you don't have to
quickscope<00:04:35.800> the<00:04:35.950> entire<00:04:36.160> game<00:04:36.430> you<00:04:36.790> can

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
quickscope the entire game you can

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.510 
quickscope the entire game you can
hardscope<00:04:37.420> if<00:04:37.570> you<00:04:37.660> need<00:04:37.840> to<00:04:37.990> or<00:04:38.020> want<00:04:38.320> to<00:04:38.620> it's

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
hardscope if you need to or want to it's

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.220 
hardscope if you need to or want to it's
not<00:04:39.670> like<00:04:39.850> you're<00:04:40.090> tied<00:04:40.420> down<00:04:40.660> you're<00:04:40.990> like<00:04:41.110> oh

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
I'm going to go into this game

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.850 
I'm going to go into this game
quickscoping<00:04:42.640> ok<00:04:43.600> you<00:04:43.660> can<00:04:43.900> say<00:04:44.110> that<00:04:44.320> but<00:04:44.530> I

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
quickscoping ok you can say that but I

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.040 
quickscoping ok you can say that but I
mean<00:04:45.160> you<00:04:45.550> can<00:04:45.700> get<00:04:45.850> some<00:04:46.000> really<00:04:46.450> nice<00:04:46.810> kills

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
mean you can get some really nice kills

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.590 
mean you can get some really nice kills
from<00:04:47.560> hardscoping<00:04:48.160> and<00:04:48.370> you<00:04:49.150> just<00:04:49.300> need<00:04:49.450> to

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
from hardscoping and you just need to

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.570 
from hardscoping and you just need to
know<00:04:49.720> when<00:04:49.960> to<00:04:49.990> do<00:04:50.260> that<00:04:50.740> when<00:04:51.130> to<00:04:51.250> quickscope

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
know when to do that when to quickscope

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.700 
know when to do that when to quickscope
went<00:04:51.820> to<00:04:51.880> drag<00:04:52.090> scope<00:04:52.210> and<00:04:52.600> that<00:04:53.050> guy<00:04:53.200> I<00:04:53.230> barely

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
went to drag scope and that guy I barely

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.620 
went to drag scope and that guy I barely
saw<00:04:54.040> him<00:04:54.130> hiding<00:04:54.370> hiding<00:04:54.640> behind<00:04:55.180> the<00:04:55.390> stump

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
saw him hiding hiding behind the stump

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.530

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
they react in play against quick scoper

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
they react in play against quick scoper
because<00:05:23.080> I<00:05:23.170> know<00:05:23.230> my<00:05:23.800> buddy<00:05:23.980> Matt<00:05:24.900> he<00:05:25.900> hates

what because whenever I go super trihard

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:35.820 
what because whenever I go super trihard
in<00:05:34.510> games<00:05:34.750> I<00:05:35.020> never<00:05:35.200> come<00:05:35.380> across<00:05:35.500> quick

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
in games I never come across quick

zoomed in for a drag scope but I didn't

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.300 
zoomed in for a drag scope but I didn't
drag<00:05:47.470> there<00:05:47.740> and<00:05:48.990> she's<00:05:49.990> trying<00:05:50.110> to<00:05:50.530> I<00:05:50.740> thought

I thought that readout was behind me so

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.650 
I thought that readout was behind me so
I<00:05:52.840> kind<00:05:53.260> of<00:05:53.320> flinch<00:05:53.620> back<00:05:53.830> and<00:05:54.040> shot<00:05:54.570> mmm<00:05:55.570> I
