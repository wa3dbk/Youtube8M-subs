 if you did not watch 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.470
 leave it at home here for you 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.199
 he was with the schools at a table 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.330
 Then I started with the hair people I already 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.760
 I said I'm not very skillful then 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.640
 I got a little kick in the front 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.369
 I made a very simple twisted 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.489
 inlaid in nothing a traditional braid 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.550
 three-pronged pulling back 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.739
 I did not do the whole hair just arrived 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.190
 behind I put a great wine two 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.700
 great to ensure and ready 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:51.539
 I began with the base of the 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.670
 maybelline that is very dry all the 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.500
 color products etc 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.010
 I leave here in the information box to 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.980
 You, but I spoke all over the face with 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.260
 a brush of sic spams 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.960
 I went to the corrective and if that mine 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.490
 little darling from the little pack 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.049
 the studio finish I did not spend so much 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.140
 because then I always like to give a 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.710
 retouched this somber one said 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.070
 berenice is the marrone is an 11 in the well 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.119
 cold and pale to the then remembered that I 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.570
 I have to light up below the 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.850
 Eyebrow in the inner corner I used the 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.500
 gento software illuminator and there I 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.520
 scoring with car then that 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.810
 umbrella a wave who said berenice 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.470
 brush can also said 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:44.909
 Berenice from smoking only everything very soft 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:47.880
 It's there I'm wearing a shadow of the 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:52.500
 Mills doubts that it is a golden well 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:55.259
 soft and light on the eyelid 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.969
 I came back with the umbrella a wave 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.520
 that says perennial if I passed with the brush 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:03.030
 apex beneath a black pencil 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.000
 in the upper and 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.920
 also close to the upper eyelashes 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.410
 only half of it out only for 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.650
 give a look in the eye and with the 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.489
 pencil even the other tip and checkers 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.739
 canine curvex said mermaid and 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.810
 eyelash mask I already told you 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.900
 No, I made a mix. I got one. 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.790
 colossal yellow pot with the 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.739
 runt of the year and the two of maybelline 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:34.269
 I'm using it because the applicator 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:37.220
 another was not good so I changed 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.450
 pretty mask of various lashes 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.069
 layers 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.620
 there I wanted a point of light more 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.739
 lit so I passed a beige pencil 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.109
 the inner corner and the 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.540
 water line and above the inner corner 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:53.629
 a little bit of illuminator the same 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.450
 illuminator software advanced from mac a 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:57.470
 little more corrective even corrective 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.590
 what's up 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:04.549
 now I go to the outline I am 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.319
 using this bronzer type from Mary Kay 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:10.430
 he has a little sparkle but 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:12.950
 It is very soft and the powder of mac 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.650
 the mac compact powder in zone t to give 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.780
 one insured there because it is very hot 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.349
 so it's always good 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.000
 the blush is one of the mac rosy then the 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:24.919
 I spend more on apples 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.579
 I thought it was a little strong, I'll be back. 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:30.799
 with the potential of the base to give 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:34.040
 Stop for not being so strong, you know. 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:36.739
 and now let's go to the illuminator area 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.620
 even if it is the tip of the nose and 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:42.919
 right here on the side of the face 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.470
 Illuminator I'll be back another layer of 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:48.799
 eyelash mask is the same as the 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:52.310
 I made a mix and now I'm going to 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:56.510
 colossal even though it's that super movie 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.340
 She knows she only comes out with warm water. 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.349
 A little water resistant is not to the test 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.769
 but it is resistant 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:06.949
 Of course I used this 100 times without 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:09.799
 problems come with teaching and 

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:12.290
 more more more eyelash mask 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:14.810
 I wanted to let you guys see that much. 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.539
 I go there and I'm correcting the 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.239
 eyebrow with a same graphite pencil 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:23.419

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:28.360
 liquid 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:32.139
 it's a very strong orange, really strong 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:35.650
 flashy but I found it beautiful and only 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:38.169
 letting go of the hair there and toy 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.870

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.449

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:49.629
 dailus is an extra volume with very argan 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:51.159
 good and he gives a nice fill in the 

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:53.949

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:56.710
