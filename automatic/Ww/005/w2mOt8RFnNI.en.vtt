so I figure it's cheap enough I'll just
I'll<00:00:58.710> check<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.129> out<00:00:59.280> I'll<00:00:59.430> try<00:00:59.670> one<00:01:00.260> mainly<00:01:01.260> as

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.910 
the blade length is 3 and 3 4 inches it
looks<00:02:27.340> real<00:02:27.610> long<00:02:27.819> it's<00:02:28.180> not<00:02:28.330> very<00:02:28.480> wide<00:02:28.920> it

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
all the blade steel it's 420hc so it's

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.300

not by no means the highest quality
steel<00:02:39.310> but<00:02:39.790> in<00:02:39.970> my<00:02:40.120> experience<00:02:40.239> the<00:02:40.900> steel

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
rust but just take care of it the edges

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.790 
rust but just take care of it the edges
they<00:02:57.730> may<00:02:57.940> go<00:02:58.180> to<00:02:58.239> dull<00:02:58.750> quickly<00:02:59.290> but<00:02:59.530> again

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
they may go to dull quickly but again

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.190 
they may go to dull quickly but again
it's<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.370> easy<00:03:00.550> to<00:03:00.790> sharpen<00:03:01.000> and<00:03:01.360> make<00:03:01.840> very

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
it's the easy to sharpen and make very

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.610 
it's the easy to sharpen and make very
sharp<00:03:02.530> this<00:03:03.370> one<00:03:03.430> came<00:03:03.850> out<00:03:04.360> of<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:04.900> box<00:03:05.080> very

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
sharp this one came out of the box very

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.039 
sharp this one came out of the box very
sharp<00:03:05.860> as<00:03:06.069> well<00:03:09.000> so<00:03:10.000> I<00:03:10.299> mean<00:03:10.480> that's<00:03:10.510> kind<00:03:10.930> of

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
sharp as well so I mean that's kind of

sharp as well so I mean that's kind of
the<00:03:11.170> knife<00:03:12.450> it<00:03:13.450> came<00:03:13.720> with<00:03:13.930> this<00:03:14.140> the<00:03:14.739> sheath

might but you know I think that's a good
trade<00:04:11.440> off<00:04:11.470> to<00:04:11.739> have<00:04:11.829> a<00:04:11.859> more<00:04:12.340> lightweight

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:12.669

beast

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910

beast
has<00:04:16.510> these<00:04:16.720> bolsters<00:04:17.709> on<00:04:17.980> here<00:04:19.830> very<00:04:20.830> few

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
has these bolsters on here very few

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:27.210 
has these bolsters on here very few
knives<00:04:21.390> use<00:04:22.390> those<00:04:22.720> anymore<00:04:26.040> some<00:04:27.040> of<00:04:27.130> the

of<00:05:59.620> the<00:05:59.680> criteria<00:06:00.310> that<00:06:00.400> I<00:06:00.669> used<00:06:01.050> evaluated<00:06:02.050> is

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:02.169 
of the criteria that I used evaluated is

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:08.610 
of the criteria that I used evaluated is
that<00:06:02.430> the<00:06:03.430> blade<00:06:04.350> while<00:06:05.350> it<00:06:06.840> I'm<00:06:07.840> gonna<00:06:08.020> go

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:08.620 
that the blade while it I'm gonna go

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.880 
that the blade while it I'm gonna go
back<00:06:08.800> here<00:06:09.070> so<00:06:09.190> I<00:06:09.220> can<00:06:09.280> see<00:06:09.550> and<00:06:09.700> focus<00:06:10.890> while

back here so I can see and focus while
the<00:06:12.040> blade<00:06:12.280> locks<00:06:12.790> up<00:06:13.120> extremely<00:06:13.810> well<00:06:15.090> when

the blade locks up extremely well when

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:18.090 
the blade locks up extremely well when
opened<00:06:16.480> I<00:06:16.660> mean<00:06:16.960> there's<00:06:17.140> no<00:06:17.260> way<00:06:17.440> going<00:06:17.650> like
