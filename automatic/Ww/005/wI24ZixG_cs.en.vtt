00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
know green buildings so I can't wait to

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.850 
know green buildings so I can't wait to
meet<00:05:46.360> him<00:05:48.630> there's<00:05:49.630> a<00:05:49.690> way<00:05:49.840> to<00:05:49.870> to<00:05:50.530> build<00:05:50.770> a

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 
meet him there's a way to to build a

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.649 
meet him there's a way to to build a
house<00:05:51.039> in<00:05:51.340> an<00:05:51.460> energy<00:05:51.820> efficient<00:05:52.240> manner

00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:52.659 
house in an energy efficient manner

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:54.300 
house in an energy efficient manner
there<00:05:52.900> is<00:05:53.050> definitely<00:05:53.650> I<00:05:53.680> mean<00:05:53.770> William<00:05:54.159> and<00:05:54.280> I

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
there is definitely I mean William and I

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.129 
there is definitely I mean William and I
work<00:05:54.490> together<00:05:54.669> so<00:05:55.060> we<00:05:55.180> do<00:05:55.300> that<00:05:55.449> a<00:05:55.479> lot<00:05:55.539> on

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:56.139 
work together so we do that a lot on

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:57.899 
work together so we do that a lot on
artifical<00:05:56.800> projects<00:05:57.190> we're<00:05:57.370> gonna<00:05:57.460> be<00:05:57.669> one<00:05:57.820> of

00:05:57.899 --> 00:05:57.909 
artifical projects we're gonna be one of

00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:59.640 
artifical projects we're gonna be one of
the<00:05:58.000> most<00:05:58.180> energy-efficient<00:05:58.930> homes<00:05:59.110> probably

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
the most energy-efficient homes probably

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.379 
the most energy-efficient homes probably
out<00:05:59.800> there<00:06:00.069> we're<00:06:00.550> gonna<00:06:00.639> look<00:06:00.819> into<00:06:00.909> possibly

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:01.389 
out there we're gonna look into possibly

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:03.809 
out there we're gonna look into possibly
doing<00:06:01.720> steel<00:06:01.960> studs<00:06:02.289> for<00:06:02.590> you<00:06:02.770> instead<00:06:03.669> of

00:06:03.809 --> 00:06:03.819 
doing steel studs for you instead of

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:05.999 
doing steel studs for you instead of
doing<00:06:04.330> two<00:06:04.509> by<00:06:04.659> fours<00:06:04.960> and<00:06:05.199> the<00:06:05.259> right<00:06:05.440> it

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:06.009 
doing two by fours and the right it

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:09.450 
doing two by fours and the right it
really<00:06:06.280> is<00:06:06.490> just<00:06:06.699> about<00:06:07.330> being<00:06:07.770> efficient<00:06:08.770> you

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
really is just about being efficient you

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.070 
really is just about being efficient you
know<00:06:09.580> you<00:06:09.849> show<00:06:10.060> me<00:06:10.240> pollution<00:06:10.720> I'll<00:06:10.840> show<00:06:11.020> you

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
know you show me pollution I'll show you

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.810 
know you show me pollution I'll show you
waste<00:06:11.440> then<00:06:11.979> we<00:06:12.099> look<00:06:12.250> at<00:06:12.340> we<00:06:12.520> realize<00:06:12.789> that

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:12.820 
waste then we look at we realize that

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.219 
waste then we look at we realize that
most<00:06:13.090> homes<00:06:13.330> are<00:06:13.449> still<00:06:13.659> built<00:06:13.870> the<00:06:13.990> way<00:06:14.080> they

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:14.229 
most homes are still built the way they

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:16.409 
most homes are still built the way they
were<00:06:14.320> in<00:06:14.440> the<00:06:14.530> 20s<00:06:14.889> yeah<00:06:15.280> and<00:06:15.550> we're<00:06:16.120> not<00:06:16.240> sure

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:16.419 
were in the 20s yeah and we're not sure

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:18.120 
were in the 20s yeah and we're not sure
why<00:06:16.570> because<00:06:16.840> the<00:06:16.960> technology<00:06:17.560> exists<00:06:17.919> to<00:06:17.949> do

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
why because the technology exists to do

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.070 
why because the technology exists to do
it<00:06:18.280> differently<00:06:18.639> so<00:06:18.729> we're<00:06:19.479> hoping<00:06:19.630> you<00:06:19.960> know

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 
it differently so we're hoping you know

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.339 
it differently so we're hoping you know
did<00:06:20.740> with<00:06:21.219> your<00:06:21.400> opportunity<00:06:22.090> we're<00:06:22.990> gonna<00:06:23.169> do

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:23.349 
did with your opportunity we're gonna do

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:25.080 
did with your opportunity we're gonna do
this<00:06:23.469> for<00:06:23.710> you<00:06:23.830> you<00:06:24.070> know<00:06:24.159> sometimes<00:06:24.880> when

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 
this for you you know sometimes when

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:26.520 
this for you you know sometimes when
you're<00:06:25.240> looking<00:06:25.270> for<00:06:25.690> something<00:06:25.900> it's<00:06:26.229> right

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:26.530 
you're looking for something it's right

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.469 
you're looking for something it's right
in<00:06:26.770> front<00:06:27.009> of<00:06:27.130> you<00:06:27.310> we've<00:06:27.669> created<00:06:27.909> a<00:06:28.090> company

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479 
in front of you we've created a company

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:30.180 
in front of you we've created a company
where<00:06:28.659> a<00:06:28.690> company<00:06:29.110> hasn't<00:06:29.320> existed<00:06:29.710> before<00:06:30.159> in

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:30.190 
where a company hasn't existed before in

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.159 
where a company hasn't existed before in
this<00:06:30.430> niche<00:06:30.639> so<00:06:31.360> I<00:06:31.389> think<00:06:31.780> it<00:06:31.900> was<00:06:32.020> really

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:32.169 
this niche so I think it was really

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:34.290 
this niche so I think it was really
natural<00:06:32.440> for<00:06:32.800> the<00:06:32.860> Begley's<00:06:33.310> you<00:06:33.909> know<00:06:34.000> for<00:06:34.180> us

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:34.300 
natural for the Begley's you know for us

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.999 
natural for the Begley's you know for us
to<00:06:34.509> sync<00:06:34.750> up<00:06:34.900> because<00:06:35.199> we<00:06:35.320> both<00:06:35.500> want<00:06:35.800> the<00:06:35.889> same

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:36.009 
to sync up because we both want the same

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:38.550 
to sync up because we both want the same
thing<00:06:36.219> I<00:06:36.699> think<00:06:37.240> Scott<00:06:37.509> is<00:06:37.539> very<00:06:38.080> much<00:06:38.289> the<00:06:38.440> guy

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 
thing I think Scott is very much the guy

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.070 
thing I think Scott is very much the guy
for<00:06:38.740> the<00:06:38.800> job<00:06:38.830> Scott<00:06:39.550> was<00:06:39.820> able<00:06:40.150> to<00:06:40.360> lay<00:06:40.840> out

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080 
for the job Scott was able to lay out

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.620 
for the job Scott was able to lay out
what<00:06:41.110> LEED<00:06:41.710> certification<00:06:42.130> is<00:06:42.580> which<00:06:43.479> is

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:43.630 
what LEED certification is which is

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.510
