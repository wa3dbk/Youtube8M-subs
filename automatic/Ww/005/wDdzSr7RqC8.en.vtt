cup of dry beans turned into three cups
once<00:01:12.840> rehydrated<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.159> worked<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:14.790> two

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
once rehydrated so I worked in two

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.020 
once rehydrated so I worked in two
batches<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.380> one<00:01:16.619> half<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.250> batch<00:01:17.460> to

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
batches this is one half of the batch to

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.910 
batches this is one half of the batch to
that<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.240> added<00:01:18.780> about<00:01:18.900> two<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.530> half<00:01:19.710> cups

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
that I added about two and a half cups

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.280 
that I added about two and a half cups
of<00:01:20.100> water<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.119> makes<00:01:21.360> about<00:01:21.600> five<00:01:21.930> cups

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
of water so that makes about five cups

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.039
