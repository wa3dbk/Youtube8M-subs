00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:09.079 
just stick with the neutrals and they go

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:11.230 
just stick with the neutrals and they go
with<00:01:09.200> everything<00:01:09.350> to<00:01:09.920> blend<00:01:10.700> with<00:01:10.820> my<00:01:11.000> hair<00:01:11.210> a

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.859 
the dark brown and ten came in the pack
and<00:01:46.460> I<00:01:46.579> think<00:01:46.759> they're<00:01:46.880> still<00:01:47.090> a<00:01:47.149> cone<00:01:47.389> mine<00:01:47.630> so

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
and I think they're still a cone mine so

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.209 
and I think they're still a cone mine so
they're<00:01:48.020> not<00:01:48.139> going<00:01:48.319> to<00:01:48.409> damage<00:01:48.859> your<00:01:49.159> hair

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:49.219 
they're not going to damage your hair

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:53.410 
they're not going to damage your hair
and<00:01:49.759> then<00:01:50.679> also<00:01:51.679> came<00:01:52.039> with<00:01:52.249> these<00:01:52.639> just<00:01:53.299> to

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
and then also came with these just to

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.399 
and then also came with these just to
clamp<00:01:53.689> the<00:01:53.899> bead<00:01:54.079> when<00:01:54.289> you<00:01:54.850> apply<00:01:55.850> it<00:01:55.909> and

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
clamp the bead when you apply it and

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.260 
clamp the bead when you apply it and
then<00:01:57.409> it<00:01:57.770> came<00:01:57.950> with<00:01:58.159> this<00:01:58.280> little<00:01:58.609> wire<00:01:58.850> tool

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
then it came with this little wire tool

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.719 
then it came with this little wire tool
so<00:01:59.539> this<00:01:59.719> is<00:01:59.869> what's<00:02:00.109> going<00:02:00.289> to<00:02:00.350> help<00:02:00.729> loop

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
so this is what's going to help loop

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.480 
so this is what's going to help loop
your<00:02:01.969> hair<00:02:02.209> through<00:02:02.630> the<00:02:02.929> bead<00:02:03.189> so<00:02:04.189> that's

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
your hair through the bead so that's

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.639 
your hair through the bead so that's
what<00:02:04.670> came<00:02:04.850> with<00:02:04.909> it<00:02:05.240> and<00:02:05.959> they<00:02:06.109> came<00:02:06.229> a<00:02:06.289> little

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
hair this is kind of hard doing this

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.869 
hair this is kind of hard doing this
with<00:03:41.569> the<00:03:41.690> camera<00:03:41.930> but<00:03:42.699> hopefully<00:03:43.699> you<00:03:43.760> guys

okay so you see the bead so now you're

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:53.619 
okay so you see the bead so now you're
gonna<00:03:52.129> take<00:03:52.400> whatever<00:03:52.699> further<00:03:53.000> extensions
