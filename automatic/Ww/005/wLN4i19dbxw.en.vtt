00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.169 
speed portability design and form factor
noise<00:00:12.630> features<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:13.860> price<00:00:14.370> so<00:00:14.940> let's<00:00:15.000> go

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
noise features and price so let's go

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.910 
noise features and price so let's go
ahead<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.420> jump<00:00:15.750> on<00:00:15.870> into<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.289> video<00:00:16.529> first

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
ahead and jump on into the video first

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.890 
ahead and jump on into the video first
of<00:00:17.100> all<00:00:17.220> talking<00:00:17.520> about<00:00:17.880> speed<00:00:18.359> now<00:00:18.840> the

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
of all talking about speed now the

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.870 
of all talking about speed now the
overall<00:00:19.080> speed<00:00:19.590> of<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.859> drive<00:00:20.130> is<00:00:20.340> exactly

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
overall speed of the drive is exactly

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.189 
overall speed of the drive is exactly
what<00:00:21.000> you<00:00:21.090> would<00:00:21.210> expect<00:00:21.240> for<00:00:21.720> something<00:00:22.050> in

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
what you would expect for something in

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.630 
what you would expect for something in
this<00:00:22.350> price<00:00:22.590> range<00:00:22.710> well<00:00:23.310> it's<00:00:23.460> nothing

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
this price range well it's nothing

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.790 
this price range well it's nothing
incredibly<00:00:24.269> fast<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.720> can<00:00:24.930> transfer<00:00:25.439> about

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
incredibly fast I can transfer about

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.130 
incredibly fast I can transfer about
five<00:00:26.160> gigs<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.670> data<00:00:26.910> in<00:00:27.180> about<00:00:27.420> two<00:00:27.689> minutes

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
five gigs of data in about two minutes

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.650 
five gigs of data in about two minutes
so<00:00:28.619> it's<00:00:28.890> decent<00:00:29.429> for<00:00:29.609> what<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:29.880> if<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.539> do

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
so it's decent for what it is if you do

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.120 
so it's decent for what it is if you do
want<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:30.960> up<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.109> speed<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.710> hard<00:00:31.920> drive

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
want to up the speed of the hard drive

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.979 
want to up the speed of the hard drive
though<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.340> do<00:00:32.520> recommend<00:00:32.850> changing<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.719> from<00:00:33.899> a

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
though I do recommend changing it from a

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.250 
though I do recommend changing it from a
USB<00:00:34.469> 3.0<00:00:35.040> drive<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.850> firewire<00:00:36.360> 800<00:00:36.630> or<00:00:37.200> a

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
USB 3.0 drive to a firewire 800 or a

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.110 
USB 3.0 drive to a firewire 800 or a
thunderbolt<00:00:37.829> drive<00:00:38.040> now<00:00:38.489> all<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.730> need<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.910> do

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
thunderbolt drive now all you need to do

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.119 
thunderbolt drive now all you need to do
to<00:00:39.239> do<00:00:39.360> this<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.780> by<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.110> adapter<00:00:40.860> for<00:00:41.070> it

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
to do this is by the adapter for it

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.770 
to do this is by the adapter for it
overall<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:41.820> would<00:00:41.940> give<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.329> speed<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
overall I would give the speed of the

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.630 
overall I would give the speed of the
hard<00:00:42.960> drive<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.170> 4<00:00:43.500> out<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.680> 5<00:00:43.950> because<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.489> is

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
hard drive a 4 out of 5 because it is

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.209 
hard drive a 4 out of 5 because it is
quite<00:00:45.059> fast<00:00:45.420> for<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.809> price<00:00:46.079> range<00:00:46.410> but<00:00:46.950> it's

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
quite fast for the price range but it's

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.830 
quite fast for the price range but it's
nothing<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:47.760> will<00:00:47.940> blow<00:00:48.270> your<00:00:48.480> mind<00:00:48.539> away

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
nothing that will blow your mind away

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.510 
nothing that will blow your mind away
next<00:00:49.559> guys<00:00:49.739> I'm<00:00:49.890> going<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.070> be<00:00:50.190> talking<00:00:50.309> about

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
next guys I'm going to be talking about

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.520 
next guys I'm going to be talking about
the<00:00:50.700> portability<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.660> drive<00:00:51.930> over<00:00:52.199> all

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
the portability of the drive over all

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.650 
the portability of the drive over all
the<00:00:52.710> hard<00:00:52.980> drive<00:00:53.190> itself<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.850> quite<00:00:54.090> small<00:00:54.449> and

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
the hard drive itself is quite small and

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.000 
the hard drive itself is quite small and
it's<00:00:54.840> exactly<00:00:55.140> what<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.590> would<00:00:55.739> need<00:00:55.949> for

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
it's exactly what you would need for

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.430 
it's exactly what you would need for
traveling<00:00:56.730> between<00:00:56.879> multiple<00:00:57.510> locations<00:00:58.079> for

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
traveling between multiple locations for

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.349 
traveling between multiple locations for
my<00:00:58.590> instance<00:00:59.010> I'm<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.250> student<00:00:59.670> so<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.090> have<00:01:00.239> to

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
my instance I'm a student so I have to

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.939 
my instance I'm a student so I have to
travel<00:01:00.600> between<00:01:00.809> home<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.230> class<00:01:01.680> and

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
travel between home and class and

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.830 
travel between home and class and
sometimes<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.879> need<00:01:02.940> my<00:01:03.120> hard<00:01:03.329> drive<00:01:03.539> for<00:01:03.570> my

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
sometimes I need my hard drive for my

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.690 
sometimes I need my hard drive for my
video<00:01:04.140> production<00:01:04.680> class<00:01:04.830> now<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.489> hard

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
video production class now the hard

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.340 
video production class now the hard
drive<00:01:05.850> itself<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.360> perfect<00:01:06.780> because<00:01:06.990> it's<00:01:07.200> 2

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
drive itself is perfect because it's 2

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.289 
drive itself is perfect because it's 2
terabytes<00:01:07.830> which<00:01:08.040> means<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.520> can<00:01:08.670> store<00:01:08.939> all

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
terabytes which means it can store all

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.420 
terabytes which means it can store all
of<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.780> data<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.290> needed<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.680> hold<00:01:10.830> but<00:01:11.310> it

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
of the data that I needed to hold but it

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.580 
of the data that I needed to hold but it
can<00:01:11.580> also<00:01:11.820> be<00:01:12.060> extremely<00:01:12.659> portable<00:01:13.229> when<00:01:13.560> I

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
can also be extremely portable when I

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.350 
can also be extremely portable when I
need<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.189> fit<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.610> tight<00:01:14.820> bag<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.330> also

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
need it to fit in the tight bag I also

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.760 
need it to fit in the tight bag I also
want<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.780> make<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.930> quick<00:01:16.200> note<00:01:16.229> about<00:01:16.439> the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
want to make a quick note about the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.469 
want to make a quick note about the
durability<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.610> drive<00:01:17.850> from<00:01:18.210> what<00:01:18.360> I've

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
durability of the drive from what I've

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.090 
durability of the drive from what I've
noticed<00:01:18.509> between<00:01:18.930> transferring<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.740> back<00:01:19.920> and

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
noticed between transferring it back and

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.890 
noticed between transferring it back and
forth<00:01:20.310> between<00:01:20.460> multiple<00:01:21.030> locations<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.780> have

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
forth between multiple locations I have

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.719 
forth between multiple locations I have
never<00:01:22.140> seen<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.409> problem<00:01:22.860> not<00:01:23.040> even<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.310> scratch

never seen a problem not even a scratch
on<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.060> drive<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.540> is<00:01:24.960> an<00:01:25.110> insanely<00:01:25.590> durable

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
on the drive it is an insanely durable

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.920 
on the drive it is an insanely durable
hard<00:01:26.280> drive<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.700> absolutely<00:01:26.880> love<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.750> for

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
hard drive and I absolutely love it for

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.140 
hard drive and I absolutely love it for
the<00:01:28.020> portability<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.799> durability<00:01:29.520> reasons

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
the portability and durability reasons

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.120 
the portability and durability reasons
it<00:01:30.299> has<00:01:30.479> overall<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:31.110> give<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.500> 5<00:01:31.740> out<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:31.920> 5

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
it has overall I give it a 5 out of 5

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.069 
it has overall I give it a 5 out of 5
because<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.610> portability<00:01:33.030> for<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.450> 2<00:01:33.689> terabyte

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
because the portability for a 2 terabyte

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.569 
because the portability for a 2 terabyte
hard<00:01:34.229> drive<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:34.680> quite<00:01:34.950> phenomenal

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
hard drive is quite phenomenal

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:36.679 
hard drive is quite phenomenal
alright<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:35.939> next<00:01:36.119> I'm<00:01:36.299> going<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.450> be<00:01:36.509> talking

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.330 
alright so next I'm going to be talking
about<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.049> design<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.619> form<00:01:37.799> factor<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.189> know

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
about the design and form factor I know

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.830 
about the design and form factor I know
I<00:01:38.430> talked<00:01:38.729> about<00:01:38.790> this<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.090> minute<00:01:39.420> ago<00:01:39.540> when<00:01:39.810> I

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
I talked about this a minute ago when I

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.910 
I talked about this a minute ago when I
was<00:01:40.020> talking<00:01:40.200> about<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.500> portability

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
was talking about the portability

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.950 
was talking about the portability
however<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.790> also<00:01:42.060> want<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.390> mention<00:01:42.630> about<00:01:42.720> the

however I also want to mention about the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.289 
however I also want to mention about the
design<00:01:43.350> itself<00:01:43.890> honestly<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.759> is<00:01:44.909> one<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.180> the

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
design itself honestly it is one of the

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.149 
design itself honestly it is one of the
best<00:01:45.600> designed<00:01:45.960> hard<00:01:46.200> drives<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.619> have<00:01:46.770> seen<00:01:47.009> on

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
best designed hard drives I have seen on

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.219 
best designed hard drives I have seen on
the<00:01:47.250> market<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.759> has<00:01:48.210> an<00:01:48.329> incredibly<00:01:48.840> sleek

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
portable hard drives that you will see

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.460 
portable hard drives that you will see
are<00:02:12.810> about

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
are about

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.800 
are about

this as it says in the name is a backup
hard<00:02:22.950> drive<00:02:23.070> so<00:02:23.520> overall<00:02:23.790> I<00:02:23.940> give<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.300> design

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
hard drive so overall I give the design

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.300 
hard drive so overall I give the design
and<00:02:24.840> form<00:02:24.990> factor<00:02:25.350> of<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.530> hard<00:02:25.710> drive<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:26.040> five

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
and form factor of the hard drive a five

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.010 
and form factor of the hard drive a five
out<00:02:26.490> of<00:02:26.520> five<00:02:26.640> because<00:02:27.120> it<00:02:27.300> is<00:02:27.420> honestly<00:02:27.780> one

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
out of five because it is honestly one

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.630 
out of five because it is honestly one
of<00:02:28.050> the<00:02:28.140> best<00:02:28.260> designed<00:02:28.920> hard<00:02:29.130> drives<00:02:29.400> I<00:02:29.520> have

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
of the best designed hard drives I have

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.220 
of the best designed hard drives I have
ever<00:02:29.850> seen<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:30.480> really<00:02:30.750> never<00:02:30.900> thought<00:02:30.990> I'd

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
ever seen and I really never thought I'd

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.230 
ever seen and I really never thought I'd
be<00:02:31.350> saying<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:31.740> about<00:02:32.040> an<00:02:32.220> external<00:02:33.120> hard

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
be saying that about an external hard

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.540 
be saying that about an external hard
drive<00:02:33.300> however<00:02:33.720> it<00:02:34.230> is<00:02:34.470> incredibly<00:02:35.160> sleek

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
drive however it is incredibly sleek

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.370 
drive however it is incredibly sleek
sitting<00:02:35.970> on<00:02:36.120> any<00:02:36.330> setup<00:02:36.780> so<00:02:36.990> the<00:02:37.110> next<00:02:37.260> thing

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
sitting on any setup so the next thing

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.690 
sitting on any setup so the next thing
I'm<00:02:37.470> going<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.650> talk<00:02:37.800> about<00:02:38.010> guys<00:02:38.160> is<00:02:38.430> noise

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
I'm going to talk about guys is noise

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.490 
I'm going to talk about guys is noise
now<00:02:39.150> noise<00:02:39.450> is<00:02:39.630> something<00:02:39.960> that<00:02:40.080> I<00:02:40.110> had<00:02:40.230> a<00:02:40.260> been

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
now noise is something that I had a been

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.810 
now noise is something that I had a been
a<00:02:40.530> concern<00:02:40.920> with<00:02:41.130> it<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.370> hard<00:02:41.550> drive<00:02:41.700> at

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
a concern with it the hard drive at

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.580 
a concern with it the hard drive at
first<00:02:42.090> however<00:02:42.540> after<00:02:43.050> I<00:02:43.080> thought<00:02:43.290> about<00:02:43.470> it

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
first however after I thought about it

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.110 
first however after I thought about it

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120

the hard drive I do want to mention
though<00:02:46.680> while<00:02:46.950> it's<00:02:47.100> not<00:02:47.250> extremely<00:02:47.670> well

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
though while it's not extremely well

most<00:02:48.180> of<00:02:48.240> the<00:02:48.330> time<00:02:48.480> there<00:02:48.690> are<00:02:48.840> times<00:02:49.080> when<00:02:49.320> it

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
most of the time there are times when it

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.480 
most of the time there are times when it
sounds<00:02:49.500> like<00:02:49.709> it's<00:02:49.860> about<00:02:49.920> to<00:02:50.130> fly<00:02:50.310> off<00:02:50.459> your

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490

however<00:02:51.510> this<00:02:51.720> really<00:02:51.959> only<00:02:52.170> happens<00:02:52.440> once

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
however this really only happens once

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.440

you<00:02:52.800> start<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.190> hard<00:02:53.340> drive<00:02:53.490> up<00:02:53.670> after<00:02:54.300> that

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
you start the hard drive up after that

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.210 
you start the hard drive up after that
no<00:02:54.870> matter<00:02:55.020> how<00:02:55.200> many<00:02:55.320> times<00:02:55.560> you<00:02:55.680> access<00:02:56.070> it

no matter how many times you access it

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.550 
no matter how many times you access it
it<00:02:56.400> is<00:02:56.580> fairly<00:02:57.120> quiet<00:02:57.570> for<00:02:57.870> what<00:02:57.990> it<00:02:58.080> is<00:02:58.110> keep

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
it is fairly quiet for what it is keep

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.140 
it is fairly quiet for what it is keep
in<00:02:58.680> mind<00:02:58.860> though<00:02:58.980> that<00:02:59.190> it's<00:02:59.550> a<00:02:59.730> hard<00:02:59.940> drive

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
in mind though that it's a hard drive

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.910 
in mind though that it's a hard drive
it's<00:03:00.390> going<00:03:00.600> to<00:03:00.810> spin<00:03:01.080> and<00:03:01.260> at<00:03:01.440> times<00:03:01.650> it<00:03:01.890> has

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
it's going to spin and at times it has

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.890 
it's going to spin and at times it has
to<00:03:02.040> spin<00:03:02.430> fast<00:03:02.640> to<00:03:02.880> do<00:03:02.970> its<00:03:03.120> job<00:03:03.330> so<00:03:03.870> I

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
to spin fast to do its job so I

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.630 
to spin fast to do its job so I
completely<00:03:04.260> understand<00:03:04.950> why<00:03:05.040> it<00:03:05.160> makes<00:03:05.370> noise

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
completely understand why it makes noise

back<00:04:03.510> so<00:04:03.930> the<00:04:04.019> backup<00:04:04.200> plus<00:04:04.530> system<00:04:04.739> is<00:04:05.070> really

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
back so the backup plus system is really

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.490 
back so the backup plus system is really
kind<00:04:05.760> of<00:04:05.850> complicated<00:04:06.360> at<00:04:06.600> first<00:04:06.630> but<00:04:06.959> when<00:04:07.380> it

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
kind of complicated at first but when it

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.080 
kind of complicated at first but when it
comes<00:04:07.680> down<00:04:07.769> to<00:04:07.890> it<00:04:08.160> it<00:04:08.280> just<00:04:08.459> backs<00:04:08.730> up<00:04:08.940> your
