that for about thirty seconds and then
switch<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.879> next<00:01:00.149> one

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
switch to the next one

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.719 
switch to the next one
thirty<00:01:02.579> Seconds<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.480> sometimes<00:01:04.439> if<00:01:05.400> you're

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
thirty Seconds and sometimes if you're

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.340 
thirty Seconds and sometimes if you're
really<00:01:05.909> tight<00:01:06.240> after<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.630> hard<00:01:06.840> training<00:01:07.170> day

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
really tight after a hard training day

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.590 
really tight after a hard training day
your<00:01:08.220> leg<00:01:08.430> will<00:01:08.610> come<00:01:08.640> up<00:01:08.939> like<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.360> but

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
your leg will come up like this but

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.929 
your leg will come up like this but
that's<00:01:09.720> okay<00:01:10.530> because<00:01:10.560> as<00:01:11.159> your<00:01:11.490> stretch<00:01:11.760> it's

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
that's okay because as your stretch it's

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.820 
that's okay because as your stretch it's
going<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.180> go<00:01:12.270> lower<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.840> lower<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.409> lower<00:01:13.439> to

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
going to go lower and lower and lower to

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.730 
going to go lower and lower and lower to
the<00:01:13.979> ground<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.520> would<00:01:15.060> do<00:01:15.210> about<00:01:15.509> two<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.500> three

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
the ground I would do about two to three

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.399 
the ground I would do about two to three
sets<00:01:17.009> thirty<00:01:17.340> seconds<00:01:17.820> each<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.119> those

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
sets thirty seconds each of those

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.080 
sets thirty seconds each of those
usually<00:01:19.409> at<00:01:19.560> night<00:01:19.590> before<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.670> go<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.850> sleep

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
usually at night before I go to sleep

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.390 
usually at night before I go to sleep
and<00:01:21.450> then<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.869> way<00:01:22.080> they're<00:01:22.860> nice<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.250> loose

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
and then that way they're nice and loose

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.670 
and then that way they're nice and loose
for<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.790> next<00:01:23.970> day<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.900> second<00:01:25.380> one<00:01:25.500> is

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
for you the next day the second one is

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.850 
for you the next day the second one is
the<00:01:26.220> harder<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.790> two<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.869> this<00:01:28.320> time<00:01:28.590> we're

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
the harder the two and this time we're

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.830 
the harder the two and this time we're
just<00:01:28.890> going<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.220> put<00:01:29.430> our<00:01:29.579> legs<00:01:29.850> both<00:01:30.540> legs

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
just going to put our legs both legs

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.149 
just going to put our legs both legs
behind<00:01:31.049> us<00:01:31.470> now<00:01:31.650> for<00:01:32.310> beginners<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:33.030> would<00:01:33.390> hold

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
behind us now for beginners I would hold

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.920 
behind us now for beginners I would hold
around<00:01:35.159> my<00:01:35.490> lower<00:01:35.700> calf<00:01:36.060> just<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.659> don't

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
around my lower calf just so I don't

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
around my lower calf just so I don't
fall<00:01:37.229> down<00:01:37.590> too<00:01:38.310> much<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:39.530> start<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.740> slowly

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
fall down too much and start to slowly

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.780 
fall down too much and start to slowly
sit<00:01:41.549> down<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.329> as<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.899> sit<00:01:43.170> your<00:01:44.040> knees<00:01:44.310> will

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.490 
sit down and as you sit your knees will
start<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.210> push<00:01:45.479> out<00:01:45.720> further<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.380> further

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500
