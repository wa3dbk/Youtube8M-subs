00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.710
 Hi everyone, that's because 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.870
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.119
 new video for a tutorial for 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.949
 make a lot of money on gt5 in 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.720
 line so to start a lot of 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.130
 my subscribers asked me to find a 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.500
 click game to win a lot 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.640
 of money on gta 5 in inline so 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.920
 today I find you with a 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.180
 tutorial that will allow you to win 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.230
 about $ 9000 every two minutes 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.820
 so for a start you are going to 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.950
 find in the same place as me in 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.750
 the video so I'm showing you where is 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.760
 find the race so once this 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.739
 place I advise you to return 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.000
 in the race to be shepherds 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.789
 and to be able thereafter 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.070
 invite your teammates rather your friends 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.680
 and once in the race with your friends 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.149
 the more their two-player no longer you 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.070
 have earned money so I'll you 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.170
 advise to be at least four that's 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.649
 the maximum and once the race 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.230
 start 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.949
 well you will be able to see that at the 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.339
 end of the race 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.570
 you will earn about $ 9000 have 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.119
 not even a minute 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.710
 because the race lasts only one minute and 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.979
 the second minute 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.189
 Well, it's time lost in the menu 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.420
 of the game so about every two 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.170
 minutes you will be able to win 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.280
 about $ 9000 so when the gym $ 9000 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.009
 it will necessarily be necessary 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.450
 arrived first to win them so if 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.640
 you arrive second I think you 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.189
 go win $ 5000 and if you arrive 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.689
 third $ 3000 I think so I 'm 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.090
 remember more but anyway 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.470
 you will see that in the video you 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.720
 are really going to make a lot of money 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.909
 very quickly because the race as 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.770
 blidi lasts only one minute 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.360
 so it's really a race that is 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.250
 very short and who is you reporting when 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.840
 even a lot of money and a lot of xp 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.689
 so as you could see I'm killing 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.060
 already level 41 and then you speak I 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.630
 am already level 48 and I was able to buy myself 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.950
 the most expensive apartment of the game so 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.229
 it's a tutorial I found by 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.149
 myself so I do not know it has been 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.500
 posted on youtube but in any case I 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.299
 know that the resignation that brings in 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.670
 much more than this little race 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.709
 but here too a lot of missions 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.170
 are unlockable only a certain level 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.940
 so this little race is unlockable 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.500
 from the beginning of the game so I'll give it to you 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.330
 advise greatly because it 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.220
 reports as you helped him about 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.650
 $ 9000 every two minutes 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.370
 more and doing a lot of times this 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.260
 small race 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.510
 you will be able to increase your 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.410
 endurance to the maximum so as you 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.600
 could have seen it in the video 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.069
 my endurance to the maximum water and I 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.840
 never lose so I advise you 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.340
 really this little tutorial and its 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.620
 small races that will allow you 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.599
 to really increase your money and your 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.670
 level as well as your stamina at 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.350
 maximum in passing it is not a 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.730
 glitch but it's a tutorial so 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.920
 it's a race that has been done 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.810
 expressly by the developers I do not know 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.310
 not why she reports so much 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.630
 money in such a short time 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.430
 we are in any case not a 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.190
 glitch but it's really a race 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.049
 normal game and so that's just before 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.580
 that this video will have pleased you 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.530
 really a tutorial that is really 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.709
 quite simple and really not bad at all 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.480
 to make you evolve on gta 5 online 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.459
 and so here you prefer the race 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.200
 as much as you want and I think I have 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.150
 a little bit of everything for this little tutorial 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.670
 which will allow you to win anyway 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.680
 a lot of money without gta5 online in 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.959
 only two minutes and no 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.370
