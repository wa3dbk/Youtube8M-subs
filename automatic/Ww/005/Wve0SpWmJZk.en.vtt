 Look, let's just talk about the error error. 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.280
 incriminating I think it's legal mistake 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.590
 incriminating you already know what the error is 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.869
 the false perception of reality only that the 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.560
 incriminating error it has a division 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.740
 it can be avoidable unavoidable 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.750
 I'm just going to put synonyms 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:05.750
 irrevocable 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:09.649
 inexcusable beauty o avoidable 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.020
 inexcusable inexcusable and can be 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:17.310
 inevitable 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:22.680
 invincible excuseable excusable then 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:27.180
 it can be avoidable inexcusable and can 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:31.380
 be unavoidable excuse gentlemen 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:34.860

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:40.290

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:44.160
 I want to be wrong, I should not be 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:48.750
 inevitable is always 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.850
 odom beauty then we will exemplify and 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.270
 how it works 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:59.640
 Pay attention two friends go to a 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:05.010
 night hunt beauty a first 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:07.530
 adventure and the other already veteran the subject 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.600
 He speaks the veteran comes to the talking friend. 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.190
 it is smart that the animal will pass 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.670
 okay 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:18.209
 Be smart, I'm just going there, Grandma there. 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.549
 What happens he gets smart and starts 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.320
 stopping foliage with the leaf begins to 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.100
 shake and heard a noise and effects of 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.370
 sword 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:29.100
 he comes close he actually killed the 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:34.560
 friend, I asked him what he wanted to 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:37.140
 friend did not he missed missed the murder 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.660
 If he was wrong, he did not want to kill a friend. 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.290
 the face of the dollar always 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:48.329
 the second question you have to ask 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:50.700
 was avoidable or unavoidable the avoidable 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:54.120
 a little more caution he could 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:57.360
 avoided then push the dollar away if it is 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.290
 unavoidable, he chooses because of his 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.269
 crime 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:04.709
 to admit there is guilty homicide exists 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:10.200
 then he will answer for homicide 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:12.560
 culpable not inevitable anyone 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:17.750
 in that situation it would do the same thing 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:22.169
 move away from dolo and cuba for nothing answered 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:24.840
 another example you go to a party of 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:29.280
 black jacket 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:31.860
 let the jacket hang, start to drink 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.310
 Then I said go away, but you're already drunk. 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.580
 though 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:39.630
 take the jacket comes to your house and 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:42.540
 check that the jacket you took does not 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:45.750
 It's like this is someone else's black too. 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:49.680
 you missed you had trouble you practiced 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:52.830
 theft already mourned not shake was sorry 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.470
 my black jacket is inevitable 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.900
 I took a black and do not even avoid going 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.990
 to answer for nothing 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.450
 only you were so drunk that you 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.050
 arrived at his house wearing a jacket and 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.560
 he began to shine and shine 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.740
 daisy etc 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:15.930
 You took the falcon's jacket, avoiding the 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:18.180
 inevitable avoidable hours 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.720
 will answer for fault if the crime 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:26.190
 admits there is a short fault not for 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:30.210
 nothing respond to another example you go 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.289
 A bar with a friend is on the cell phone. 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.380
 on the table 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:35.880
 You pick up the cell phone and get home. 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.400
 Wow 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.900
 This cell phone is not mine, you thought. 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.090
 possible actually took a cellphone 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:46.820
 you are good you do not care 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:50.039
 keeps the dollar from stealing 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:54.810
 avoided unavoidable and took the cell phone 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:58.490
 identical to its inevitable for nothing 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:02.070
 will now answer your friend's cell phone 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:06.630
 that the cell phone you actually took 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:08.250
 it is very different from its avoidable distance 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:12.300
 dollar is responsible for the crime 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:15.680
 admit that it exists by robots not for 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:19.099
 nothing responds then the error 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:22.500
 incriminating it can be avoidable 

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:25.710
 inexcusable 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:29.789
 blame the crime to admit that it can be 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:34.099
 unavoidable or excruciating move away from 

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:38.440
 It's okay for nothing to respond to the beauty. 

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:42.070
 So wait, I 'll post this little trick. 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:44.050
 on facebook and youtube we are together 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:46.380
 until an upcoming opportunity 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.380
 bye
