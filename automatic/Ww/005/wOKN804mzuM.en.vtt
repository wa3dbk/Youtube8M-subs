00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.540
 thank you 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.889
 hello everyone guys well find mine 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.380
 channel I am blasi that the 68 and 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.180
 welcome to this new video 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:23.390
 Today we're kids on dragon ball 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.369
 z budokai te in goblets 3 pay I did not see 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.040
 wait to offer you a video on this 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.230
 game is this video I will need precisely 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.029
 for something but let's start right away 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.920
 choose the characters and then with ne 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.239
 I'll talk during the fight then 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.700
 as characters I decided that 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.739
 we will use later it started against small 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.820
 just laughed not to spoil anything 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.500
 in conclusion 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:49.280
 so guys I would say we can do 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:55.730
 start this bijoux clash right away 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:57.500
 vintage perfect articles we are in 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.929
 small clash meanwhile runs on the water 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.960
 and we can also ok on the water 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:04.640
 first serious blow of course do me 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.610
 remember rates for a while not 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:12.080
 I remember them well from 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.990
 I hope the difficulty is not set 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.010
 too high though I don't think so 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.720
 should be a new rescue 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:23.120
 this we see nothing continues to 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:28.660
 hit me yet heavily by the dai dai 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:31.100
 come on from the continues from then on 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.710
 then what I wanted to tell you first is 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.830
 which in practice I was thinking that 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.630
 we could do a series on this game 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.710
 but this will be a decision that I 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.940
 I will therefore believe in the long run 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.040
 a series on this game could 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.890
 arrive 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.200
 in a month two months I don't know 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.690
 sincerely it is to see a little how they go 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.550
 the things however the thing and that I would like 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:59.230
 meanwhile I'm doing a good job anyway 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.970
 here is ok of course this is the move 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.950
 I still remember why I have it 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.920
 solar explosion did not even know 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.580
 as I did with a small and strong 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.860
 however true that I said this series 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.690
 I would like in practice to work side by side 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.550
 obviously to another series on a game 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.709
 clean 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.290
 now let's see if you like it 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.350
 something like that we will pass to two 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.510
 daily videos, however, as I said 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.959
 I don't know when something could happen 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.880
 such 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.020
 while you wait for it to come 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.600
 the moves collide 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.980
 we hope we can beat it ok 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.410
 perfect 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.420
 I had done enormous damage to you yet 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.840
 never to make the attack of caio think that 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.330
 no but possible if we succeed not me 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.970
 I remember how perfect it was perfect 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.360
 race we did but still not 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.100
 I remembered his game so hard e 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:56.019
 I have great too we threw it 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:57.400
 ko ok let's move on to this one right away 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.459
 clash seeing as colored is first 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.100
 lasted really very little at least I think 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.980
 I didn't check with it's duration though 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.049
 as I said so we are thinking of 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.930
 propose a series on the whole channel 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:14.049
 his game, however, which he will obviously play from 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.150
 accompaniment to another series is 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.100
 obviously I don't even know when 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.620
 will start with evening 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.870
 this will depend on all of you because if in 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.269
 comments write me you want 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.519
 it made this game then ok the 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.049
 we definitely do 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:32.620
 but as I told you, he will have to choose us 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:34.870
 more or less a date when to start it e 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.230
 I do n't think this is short-term 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.610
 however, what they said meanwhile or that 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.700
 we took it in full with the cannon 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:46.000
 galic because there is still and I would like to try 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.760
 to make a supreme move then it is a 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.090
 little how they turned this well 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:55.510
 but don't make it to him we end up on the basin 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.829
 hoc and evil fires the perfect few 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.599
 we also have weight 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:00.549
 let's see what it's about is beautiful 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:03.099
 this move this is the move with which 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.470
 vegeta in practice defeats defeats 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:08.440
 you make tassel die if I'm not mistaken 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.530
 should be bitten tassel loves in 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.720
 that case ok we conclude with a cannon 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.430
 galic if meanwhile we take that of 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.940
 they are finished 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:21.459
 ok i avoided even my own room 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.820
 very active you know how it was done also 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:28.479
 blog for embezzlement 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:32.650
 ok it pays an absurd confusion between the 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:34.300
 xenon rates verse these when 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.520
 the explosion alone wants to win for 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:41.320
 power 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.910
 then I can not find who liked freely 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.940
 sadist I'm doing 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.680
 I don't even know the transformation raga 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.639
 as I did it I was not taking 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.889
 all keys must have pressed r3 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:56.110
 ok perfect guys there is no confusion 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.849
 better than this ok guys then 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.530
 this video can be concluded here vi 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:01.840

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.949

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.620
 obviously that will be the accompaniment 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:07.060
 to another series obviously leave a 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.770
