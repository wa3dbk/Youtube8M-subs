lot<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.670> hair<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.270> usually<00:01:36.390> takes<00:01:36.750> about

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
lot of hair so it usually takes about

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.800 
lot of hair so it usually takes about
four<00:01:37.229> sections<00:01:37.680> per<00:01:38.159> side<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:39.479> I'm<00:01:39.570> tilting

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
four sections per side so I'm tilting

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.649 
four sections per side so I'm tilting
the<00:01:40.350> blow-dryer<00:01:41.220> downward<00:01:41.880> because<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.540> is

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
the blow-dryer downward because that is

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.389 
the blow-dryer downward because that is
going<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:43.020> help<00:01:43.200> with<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.470> frizzy<00:01:43.799> situation

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
going to help with the frizzy situation

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.060 
going to help with the frizzy situation
and<00:01:44.640> I'm<00:01:45.119> just<00:01:45.299> using<00:01:45.450> my<00:01:45.600> round<00:01:45.990> brush<00:01:46.380> not

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
and I'm just using my round brush not

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.800 
and I'm just using my round brush not
getting<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.579> SuperDuper<00:01:48.149> straight<00:01:48.600> using

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
getting it SuperDuper straight using

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.410 
getting it SuperDuper straight using
this<00:01:49.079> step<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.560> really<00:01:49.979> just<00:01:50.100> want<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.640> loosen

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
this step I really just want to loosen

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.450 
this step I really just want to loosen
up<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.600> curl<00:01:51.899> as<00:01:52.079> much<00:01:52.229> as<00:01:52.380> possible<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.040> get

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
up the curl as much as possible and get

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.910 
up the curl as much as possible and get
my<00:01:53.610> hair<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.030> be<00:01:54.060> dry<00:01:54.930> before<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.409> go<00:01:55.590> in<00:01:55.740> with<00:01:55.890> a

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
my hair to be dry before I go in with a

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.030 
my hair to be dry before I go in with a
flat<00:01:56.219> iron<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.270> do<00:01:57.360> this<00:01:57.659> through<00:01:58.040> out

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
flat iron so that I do this through out

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.620 
flat iron so that I do this through out
the<00:01:59.280> rest<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.579> my<00:01:59.729> hair<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.180> make<00:02:00.299> sure<00:02:00.450> that

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
the rest of my hair and make sure that

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.870 
the rest of my hair and make sure that
it's<00:02:00.750> all<00:02:00.930> dry<00:02:01.200> again<00:02:01.710> you'll<00:02:02.250> see<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:02.729> it's

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
it's all dry again you'll see that it's

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.940 
it's all dry again you'll see that it's
not<00:02:03.000> going<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.540> be<00:02:03.630> bone<00:02:03.869> straight<00:02:04.259> just<00:02:04.590> yet<00:02:04.799> I

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
not going to be bone straight just yet I

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.399 
not going to be bone straight just yet I
use<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.219> flat<00:02:05.460> iron<00:02:05.490> for<00:02:05.939> that

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
use the flat iron for that

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.020 
use the flat iron for that
and<00:02:06.500> I'm<00:02:06.649> using<00:02:06.799> my<00:02:06.950> boar<00:02:07.310> bristle<00:02:07.729> brush

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
and I'm using my boar bristle brush

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.389 
and I'm using my boar bristle brush
because<00:02:08.330> boar<00:02:08.720> bristles<00:02:09.170> help<00:02:09.470> to<00:02:09.950> add<00:02:10.069> shine

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
because boar bristles help to add shine

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.309 
because boar bristles help to add shine
to<00:02:10.459> the<00:02:10.759> hair<00:02:10.789> and<00:02:11.270> also<00:02:11.450> help<00:02:11.810> to<00:02:11.930> disperse

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
to the hair and also help to disperse

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.320 
to the hair and also help to disperse
oils<00:02:12.770> so<00:02:12.920> when<00:02:13.040> you're<00:02:13.160> using<00:02:13.310> serums<00:02:13.790> or<00:02:14.030> oils

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
oils so when you're using serums or oils

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.030 
oils so when you're using serums or oils
on<00:02:14.480> your<00:02:14.630> hair<00:02:14.840> that<00:02:15.319> it's<00:02:15.470> gonna<00:02:15.590> help<00:02:15.830> to

disperse<00:02:16.519> that<00:02:16.819> so<00:02:17.330> I<00:02:17.360> do<00:02:17.480> highly<00:02:17.989> highly

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
disperse that so I do highly highly

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.080 
disperse that so I do highly highly
recommend<00:02:18.739> a<00:02:18.950> boar<00:02:19.280> bristle<00:02:19.610> brush<00:02:19.790> if<00:02:20.030> you

coffee<00:02:45.290> break

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.920 

okay<00:03:00.980> so<00:03:01.040> once<00:03:01.400> that<00:03:01.700> side<00:03:02.360> of<00:03:02.480> my<00:03:02.569> hair<00:03:02.780> is

done being blow-dried I'm gonna go back

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.250 
done being blow-dried I'm gonna go back
to<00:03:04.549> the<00:03:04.640> first<00:03:04.970> side<00:03:05.360> and<00:03:05.420> I'm<00:03:05.780> gonna<00:03:05.930> let<00:03:06.140> it

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
to the first side and I'm gonna let it

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.580 
to the first side and I'm gonna let it
loose<00:03:06.440> and<00:03:06.739> then<00:03:06.799> I'm<00:03:07.579> going<00:03:07.910> to<00:03:08.030> take<00:03:08.720> maybe

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
loose and then I'm going to take maybe

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.740 
loose and then I'm going to take maybe
like<00:03:09.860> two<00:03:10.160> inch<00:03:10.400> sections<00:03:10.940> and<00:03:11.239> then<00:03:11.630> I'm

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
like two inch sections and then I'm

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.720 
like two inch sections and then I'm
actually<00:03:11.900> gonna<00:03:12.140> split<00:03:12.590> the<00:03:12.829> two<00:03:13.040> inches<00:03:13.340> into

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
actually gonna split the two inches into

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.610 
actually gonna split the two inches into
like<00:03:13.850> one<00:03:14.239> inch<00:03:14.480> sections<00:03:14.959> so<00:03:15.140> this<00:03:15.319> is<00:03:15.440> why<00:03:15.560> it

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
like one inch sections so this is why it

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.800 
like one inch sections so this is why it
does<00:03:15.890> take<00:03:16.160> quite<00:03:16.400> a<00:03:16.459> bit<00:03:16.670> so<00:03:17.180> I<00:03:17.209> take<00:03:17.420> my<00:03:17.450> flat

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
does take quite a bit so I take my flat

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.449 
does take quite a bit so I take my flat
iron<00:03:18.049> I<00:03:18.230> like<00:03:18.380> to<00:03:18.500> go<00:03:18.620> one<00:03:18.769> with<00:03:18.890> my<00:03:19.010> one<00:03:19.280> inch

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
iron I like to go one with my one inch

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.940 
iron I like to go one with my one inch
flat<00:03:19.609> iron<00:03:19.940> first<00:03:20.269> go<00:03:20.959> through<00:03:20.989> the<00:03:21.260> roots<00:03:21.680> and

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
flat iron first go through the roots and

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.670 
flat iron first go through the roots and
then<00:03:22.609> I<00:03:22.850> drag<00:03:23.569> that<00:03:23.600> down<00:03:23.870> but<00:03:24.230> I<00:03:24.290> want<00:03:24.500> to<00:03:24.560> make

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
then I drag that down but I want to make

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.870 
then I drag that down but I want to make
sure<00:03:24.709> that<00:03:24.920> my<00:03:25.040> roots<00:03:25.280> are<00:03:25.400> as<00:03:25.519> straight<00:03:25.760> as

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
sure that my roots are as straight as

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.879 
sure that my roots are as straight as
possible<00:03:25.959> but<00:03:26.959> there<00:03:27.260> you<00:03:27.440> could<00:03:27.590> see<00:03:27.709> that<00:03:27.829> I

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:27.889 
possible but there you could see that I

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:29.620 
possible but there you could see that I
was<00:03:28.040> using<00:03:28.220> the<00:03:28.370> tension<00:03:28.730> comb<00:03:29.120> and<00:03:29.389> now<00:03:29.540> I'm

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
was using the tension comb and now I'm

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.660 
was using the tension comb and now I'm
using<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.959> tension<00:03:30.350> brush<00:03:30.620> so<00:03:31.220> basically<00:03:31.549> I

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
using the tension brush so basically I

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.520 
using the tension brush so basically I
just<00:03:31.910> take<00:03:32.120> each<00:03:32.329> the<00:03:32.630> tension<00:03:33.049> tool<00:03:33.260> weather

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
just take each the tension tool weather

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.940 
just take each the tension tool weather
comb<00:03:33.799> or<00:03:34.069> brush<00:03:34.100> and<00:03:34.730> use<00:03:35.180> that<00:03:35.359> to<00:03:35.600> follow<00:03:35.959> the

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
comb or brush and use that to follow the

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.090 
comb or brush and use that to follow the
Flatiron<00:03:37.819> down<00:03:38.150> the<00:03:38.299> shaft<00:03:38.630> of<00:03:38.810> my<00:03:38.959> hair<00:03:39.230> and

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
Flatiron down the shaft of my hair and

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.559 
Flatiron down the shaft of my hair and
then<00:03:40.519> I'm<00:03:40.609> gonna<00:03:40.700> do<00:03:40.880> the<00:03:40.970> same<00:03:41.150> thing<00:03:41.359> so<00:03:41.389> I'm

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
then I'm gonna do the same thing so I'm

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.110 
then I'm gonna do the same thing so I'm
gonna<00:03:41.690> show<00:03:41.959> you<00:03:42.019> once<00:03:43.010> again<00:03:43.280> start<00:03:43.850> at<00:03:43.970> the

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
gonna show you once again start at the

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.569 
gonna show you once again start at the
roots<00:03:44.389> and<00:03:44.660> then<00:03:45.019> I<00:03:45.260> will<00:03:45.560> make<00:03:46.430> sure<00:03:46.549> that

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
roots and then I will make sure that

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:48.039 
roots and then I will make sure that
part<00:03:46.940> is<00:03:47.030> straight<00:03:47.269> and<00:03:47.420> then<00:03:47.630> I<00:03:47.720> will<00:03:47.900> go

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
part is straight and then I will go

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.470 
part is straight and then I will go
downwards<00:03:48.859> following<00:03:49.639> it<00:03:49.790> with<00:03:50.000> the<00:03:50.209> tension

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
downwards following it with the tension

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.410 
downwards following it with the tension
tool<00:03:50.959> here<00:03:51.350> I'm<00:03:51.500> using<00:03:51.650> a<00:03:51.889> boar<00:03:52.100> bristle

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
tool here I'm using a boar bristle

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.870 
tool here I'm using a boar bristle
tension<00:03:53.420> brush<00:03:53.840> I<00:03:54.200> like<00:03:54.889> using<00:03:55.310> the<00:03:55.489> tension

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
tension brush I like using the tension

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.160 
tension brush I like using the tension
tools<00:03:56.090> because<00:03:56.359> I<00:03:56.389> feel<00:03:56.660> like<00:03:56.780> it<00:03:56.900> makes<00:03:56.989> the

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
tools because I feel like it makes the

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.590 
tools because I feel like it makes the
process<00:03:57.560> go<00:03:57.709> by<00:03:57.859> a<00:03:57.889> lot<00:03:58.220> faster<00:03:58.819> it's<00:03:59.000> ceramic

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
process go by a lot faster it's ceramic

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.360 
process go by a lot faster it's ceramic
and<00:03:59.780> so<00:04:00.049> it<00:04:00.170> holds<00:04:00.350> in<00:04:00.560> some<00:04:00.769> of<00:04:00.859> the<00:04:00.920> heat<00:04:01.160> and

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
and so it holds in some of the heat and

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.640 
and so it holds in some of the heat and
so<00:04:02.030> I'm<00:04:02.120> not<00:04:02.239> having<00:04:02.480> to<00:04:02.630> use<00:04:02.810> a<00:04:02.870> flat<00:04:03.230> iron<00:04:03.410> to

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
so I'm not having to use a flat iron to

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.410 
so I'm not having to use a flat iron to
go<00:04:03.769> over<00:04:04.069> my<00:04:04.099> hair<00:04:04.400> as<00:04:04.579> much<00:04:04.910> when<00:04:05.150> I'm<00:04:05.269> using

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
go over my hair as much when I'm using

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.020 
go over my hair as much when I'm using
the<00:04:05.690> brush<00:04:05.900> okay<00:04:06.829> so<00:04:06.889> I<00:04:07.040> just<00:04:07.099> sped<00:04:07.489> it<00:04:07.609> up<00:04:07.670> so

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
the brush okay so I just sped it up so

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.250 
the brush okay so I just sped it up so
that<00:04:08.060> you<00:04:08.269> guys<00:04:08.450> wouldn't<00:04:08.720> be<00:04:08.810> watching<00:04:09.139> it

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
that you guys wouldn't be watching it

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.890 
that you guys wouldn't be watching it
for<00:04:09.440> hours<00:04:09.739> and<00:04:09.859> hours<00:04:10.130> on<00:04:10.280> end

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
for hours and hours on end

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.410 
for hours and hours on end
and<00:04:11.170> then<00:04:11.500> once<00:04:11.800> I'm<00:04:12.069> done<00:04:12.340> I'm<00:04:12.610> here<00:04:12.910> just<00:04:13.300> on

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
and then once I'm done I'm here just on

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.110 
and then once I'm done I'm here just on
the<00:04:13.629> last<00:04:13.810> section<00:04:14.349> of<00:04:14.739> my<00:04:15.040> hair<00:04:15.069> using<00:04:15.940> a

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
the last section of my hair using a

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.550 
the last section of my hair using a
different<00:04:16.419> flatiron<00:04:16.900> I<00:04:17.079> don't<00:04:17.290> know<00:04:17.380> why<00:04:17.530> I

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
different flatiron I don't know why I

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.229 
different flatiron I don't know why I
switch<00:04:18.040> between<00:04:18.250> the<00:04:18.489> two<00:04:18.639> but<00:04:18.820> that's<00:04:18.970> pretty

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
switch between the two but that's pretty

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.150 
switch between the two but that's pretty
much<00:04:19.449> what<00:04:19.690> it<00:04:19.780> looks<00:04:19.930> like<00:04:20.079> once<00:04:20.859> it's<00:04:21.040> all

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
much what it looks like once it's all

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.430 
much what it looks like once it's all
done<00:04:21.419> okay<00:04:22.419> so<00:04:22.479> I've<00:04:22.750> moved<00:04:22.930> on<00:04:23.139> to<00:04:23.320> the<00:04:23.410> other

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
done okay so I've moved on to the other

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.370 
done okay so I've moved on to the other
half<00:04:24.070> of<00:04:24.280> my<00:04:24.430> head<00:04:24.669> and<00:04:24.900> repeating<00:04:25.900> all<00:04:26.139> of<00:04:26.169> the

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
half of my head and repeating all of the

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.290 
half of my head and repeating all of the
steps<00:04:26.620> that<00:04:26.710> I<00:04:26.800> talked<00:04:27.070> about<00:04:27.160> so<00:04:27.550> just<00:04:27.790> taking

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
steps that I talked about so just taking

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.670 
steps that I talked about so just taking
a<00:04:28.479> little<00:04:28.720> one<00:04:28.900> one<00:04:29.169> and<00:04:29.290> a<00:04:29.320> half<00:04:29.470> inch

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
a little one one and a half inch

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.580 
a little one one and a half inch
sections<00:04:30.130> using<00:04:30.790> the<00:04:31.030> flat<00:04:31.270> iron<00:04:31.510> and<00:04:32.320> then

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
sections using the flat iron and then

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.219 
sections using the flat iron and then
using<00:04:33.370> the<00:04:33.669> tension<00:04:34.419> brush<00:04:34.600> or<00:04:34.810> the<00:04:35.020> tension

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
using the tension brush or the tension

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:38.100 
using the tension brush or the tension
comb<00:04:35.560> to<00:04:36.070> follow<00:04:36.460> that<00:04:36.699> through<00:04:37.000> and<00:04:37.240> then<00:04:37.780> I'm

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
comb to follow that through and then I'm

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.420 
comb to follow that through and then I'm
pretty<00:04:38.380> much<00:04:38.560> done<00:04:38.800> this<00:04:39.040> is<00:04:39.130> the<00:04:39.220> last

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
pretty much done this is the last

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.480 
pretty much done this is the last
section<00:04:39.610> on<00:04:39.850> that<00:04:40.060> side<00:04:41.100> again<00:04:42.100> using<00:04:42.430> a

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
section on that side again using a

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.370 
section on that side again using a
different<00:04:42.850> flat<00:04:43.060> iron<00:04:43.240> and<00:04:43.510> by<00:04:43.720> tension<00:04:44.139> brush

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
different flat iron and by tension brush

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.040 
different flat iron and by tension brush
and<00:04:44.770> making<00:04:45.310> it<00:04:45.430> all<00:04:45.580> straight<00:04:46.210> and<00:04:46.450> once<00:04:46.900> I'm

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
and making it all straight and once I'm

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.250 
and making it all straight and once I'm
finished<00:04:47.229> this<00:04:48.010> is<00:04:48.310> what<00:04:48.580> it<00:04:48.790> looks<00:04:49.000> like<00:04:49.260> so

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
finished this is what it looks like so

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.750 
finished this is what it looks like so
again<00:04:50.500> I<00:04:50.650> don't<00:04:50.860> feel<00:04:51.040> like<00:04:51.160> I<00:04:51.310> do<00:04:51.370> anything

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
again I don't feel like I do anything

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.300 
again I don't feel like I do anything
special<00:04:52.540> when<00:04:53.050> it<00:04:53.139> comes<00:04:53.350> to<00:04:53.590> flat<00:04:53.919> ironing<00:04:54.160> my

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
special when it comes to flat ironing my

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.620 
special when it comes to flat ironing my
hair<00:04:54.340> but<00:04:54.700> since<00:04:54.910> it<00:04:55.030> was<00:04:55.120> so<00:04:55.150> highly

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
hair but since it was so highly

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.840 
hair but since it was so highly
requested<00:04:55.870> I<00:04:56.260> thought<00:04:56.740> I<00:04:56.919> would<00:04:57.130> film<00:04:57.550> it<00:04:57.639> for

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
requested I thought I would film it for

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:58.230
