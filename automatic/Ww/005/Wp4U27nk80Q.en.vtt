 American scientists nicknamed cytopus barium 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.860
 Russian amanita for the peculiar 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.219
 coloration but those and other maritime 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:14.360
 the giant turned out to be himself therefore therefore possible in 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.220
 soon nickname China will have 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.220
 change she is not afraid of people 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.960
 notes biologists swim very 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.010
 close pharynx with scientists and gives himself 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.960
 pat such friendliness probably 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.869
 can be explained to those who want that day 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.820
 standards 20 ton fly sea x still a teenager 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.319
 such 

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:31.579
 female 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.510
 it's pretty young for 6 years 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.510
 she probably will have years 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.780
 that is, it is a big game then offspring 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.780
 and they are waiting for the Kamchatka region 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.690
 she will teach her child also to lead 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.380
 compactly 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.570
 with boats from 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.020
 in the composition of the craft 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.030
 summer study of Kamchatka scientists 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.410
 showed as many gray whales as in this 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.030
 there was no season off the coast of Kamchatka 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.660
 never 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.110
 in bay olga simultaneously 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.920
 recorded more than fifty individuals 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.850
 sea ​​giants and this is a record like 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.220
 at least three years since the whales became 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.960
 go to Kronotsky Bay constantly 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.260
 Generally in bay Olga there mostly this 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.990
 young dwells 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.250
 there is warmer 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.300
 that plus 17 years 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.340
 reaches like there 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.540
 the organizers provided a report 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:26.690
 what army 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.500
 well and so on that is there and so here 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.230
 greenhouse conditions all the more there is no 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.930
 no shipping closed anyone 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:34.860
 relatively small 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.220
 the number of whales is already 200 olga several 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.450
 years gives the opportunity to specialists 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.370
 observe them in their natural environment 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.630
 habitat take samples for biopsy 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.180
 so some whales have already become 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.200
 old acquaintances scientists and received from 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.390
 them for example gray whale 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.469
 which took a piece of skin for research 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:51.750
 Prime Putin during a visit to 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.259

 October spaces with a partisan avenue 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.789
 Alexey hit jasper and many others now 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:02.000
 gray whales wander to Sakhalin on the reverse 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.750
 the paths to zero will enter Kamchatka and then 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.799
 california where do they get married 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.890
 season but the coast of the peninsula but already with 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.739
 replenishment 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.659
 they will be back next spring 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:13.290
