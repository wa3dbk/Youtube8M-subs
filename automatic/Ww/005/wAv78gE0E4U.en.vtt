this<00:00:51.590> in<00:00:51.800> mind<00:00:51.830> as<00:00:52.160> we<00:00:52.310> play<00:00:52.720> now<00:00:53.720> because<00:00:54.230> Miss

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
this in mind as we play now because Miss

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.620 
this in mind as we play now because Miss
Perry's<00:00:55.070> name<00:00:55.370> starts<00:00:55.760> with<00:00:55.880> the<00:00:55.970> P<00:00:56.210> and<00:00:56.480> that

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:56.630 
Perry's name starts with the P and that

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.470 
Perry's name starts with the P and that
comes<00:00:57.110> in<00:00:57.290> the<00:00:57.350> alphabet<00:00:57.770> before<00:00:58.130> s<00:00:58.480> she's

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:04.990 

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:11.110 

okay<00:01:05.990> I'm<00:01:06.320> going<00:01:06.560> to<00:01:06.740> start<00:01:09.340> I'm<00:01:10.340> gonna<00:01:10.670> start

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:11.120 
okay I'm going to start I'm gonna start

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:18.820 
okay I'm going to start I'm gonna start
with<00:01:14.350> 707<00:01:15.350> only<00:01:15.980> has<00:01:16.250> one<00:01:16.670> factor<00:01:17.180> pair<00:01:17.750> one<00:01:18.650> in

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
with 707 only has one factor pair one in

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.430 
with 707 only has one factor pair one in
seven<00:01:19.250> and<00:01:19.340> I<00:01:19.490> can't<00:01:19.760> choose<00:01:20.090> 7<00:01:20.860> so<00:01:21.860> I<00:01:21.890> get<00:01:22.310> a<00:01:22.340> 1

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
seven and I can't choose 7 so I get a 1

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.200 
seven and I can't choose 7 so I get a 1
the<00:01:24.440> way<00:01:24.590> we<00:01:24.800> win<00:01:25.040> the<00:01:25.220> game<00:01:25.250> is<00:01:25.730> to<00:01:25.760> get<00:01:26.030> the

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
the way we win the game is to get the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.810 
the way we win the game is to get the
most<00:01:26.450> points<00:01:26.840> will<00:01:27.710> count<00:01:27.980> up<00:01:28.100> our<00:01:28.250> circles<00:01:28.640> at

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
most points will count up our circles at

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.520 
most points will count up our circles at
the<00:01:28.850> end<00:01:29.120> that<00:01:29.510> are<00:01:29.540> circled<00:01:29.990> by<00:01:30.110> our<00:01:30.260> color

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
the end that are circled by our color

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.160 
the end that are circled by our color
marker<00:01:31.010> now<00:01:31.880> it's<00:01:32.090> my<00:01:32.300> turn<00:01:32.630> to<00:01:32.690> choose<00:01:33.110> a

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
marker now it's my turn to choose a

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.120 
marker now it's my turn to choose a
number<00:01:33.500> and<00:01:33.770> miss<00:01:33.920> Perry<00:01:34.280> will<00:01:34.490> choose<00:01:34.820> the

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
number and miss Perry will choose the

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.500 
number and miss Perry will choose the
proper<00:01:37.130> factors<00:01:37.700> I'm<00:01:38.000> going<00:01:38.510> to<00:01:38.600> choose<00:01:38.840> 15<00:01:40.510> 15

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
proper factors I'm going to choose 15 15

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.500 
proper factors I'm going to choose 15 15
okay<00:01:42.500> well<00:01:43.280> I<00:01:43.520> know<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:45.770> factor<00:01:46.310> pairs<00:01:46.729> 1<00:01:47.360> in

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
okay well I know the factor pairs 1 in

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:54.820 
okay well I know the factor pairs 1 in
15<00:01:48.940> 2<00:01:49.940> doesn't<00:01:50.390> go<00:01:50.420> into<00:01:50.810> 15<00:01:51.490> 3<00:01:52.490> does<00:01:52.729> 3<00:01:53.390> times<00:01:54.140> 5

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
15 2 doesn't go into 15 3 does 3 times 5

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:00.820 
15 2 doesn't go into 15 3 does 3 times 5
is<00:01:55.479> 15<00:01:56.680> and<00:01:57.680> I<00:01:58.580> believe<00:01:59.210> those<00:01:59.990> are<00:02:00.229> all<00:02:00.409> the

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
is 15 and I believe those are all the

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.510 
is 15 and I believe those are all the
factor<00:02:01.400> pairs<00:02:01.700> of<00:02:02.000> 15<00:02:02.590> so<00:02:03.590> when<00:02:03.740> I<00:02:03.770> look<00:02:04.070> at<00:02:04.250> my

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
factor pairs of 15 so when I look at my

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.450 
factor pairs of 15 so when I look at my
game<00:02:04.760> board<00:02:05.060> I<00:02:05.240> see<00:02:05.510> that<00:02:05.720> 1<00:02:06.049> has<00:02:06.440> already<00:02:06.710> been

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
game board I see that 1 has already been

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.860 
game board I see that 1 has already been
taken<00:02:08.170> 15<00:02:09.399> because<00:02:10.399> that's<00:02:10.840> we're<00:02:11.840> doing

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
taken 15 because that's we're doing

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.190 
taken 15 because that's we're doing
proper<00:02:12.529> factors<00:02:13.010> I<00:02:13.450> would<00:02:14.450> need<00:02:14.629> to<00:02:14.810> circle

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
proper factors I would need to circle

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.420 
proper factors I would need to circle
that<00:02:15.230> that's<00:02:15.590> already<00:02:15.799> been<00:02:15.950> Circle

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
that that's already been Circle

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:23.410 
that that's already been Circle
three<00:02:17.430> is<00:02:17.730> available<00:02:18.590> and<00:02:19.730> five<00:02:20.730> is<00:02:21.590> available

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
three is available and five is available

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.100 
three is available and five is available
all<00:02:24.420> right

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
all right

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:32.380 
all right
so<00:02:25.410> my<00:02:25.950> move<00:02:26.610> would<00:02:27.330> be<00:02:29.450> I'm<00:02:30.450> gonna<00:02:30.690> go<00:02:30.930> with<00:02:31.140> 14

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
so my move would be I'm gonna go with 14

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.870 
so my move would be I'm gonna go with 14
14<00:02:33.390> is<00:02:33.570> even<00:02:34.020> so<00:02:34.500> I<00:02:34.530> know<00:02:34.680> it's<00:02:35.010> divisible<00:02:35.370> by<00:02:35.670> 2

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
14 is even so I know it's divisible by 2

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.930 
14 is even so I know it's divisible by 2
so<00:02:36.560> that's<00:02:37.560> 2<00:02:37.800> &amp;<00:02:38.250> 7<00:02:39.140> 1<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:40.170> 14<00:02:40.830> but<00:02:41.160> ones<00:02:41.400> taken

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
so that's 2 &amp; 7 1 and 14 but ones taken

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.720 
so that's 2 &amp; 7 1 and 14 but ones taken
in<00:02:42.060> 14<00:02:42.540> is<00:02:42.720> not<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:42.930> proper<00:02:43.410> factor<00:02:43.890> so<00:02:44.250> I<00:02:44.280> can

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
in 14 is not a proper factor so I can

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.170 
in 14 is not a proper factor so I can
have<00:02:44.940> 2<00:02:45.210> and<00:02:45.510> 7<00:02:46.020> I<00:02:46.200> have<00:02:47.100> two<00:02:48.140> 7s<00:02:49.140> already<00:02:49.530> taken

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
have 2 and 7 I have two 7s already taken

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.850 
have 2 and 7 I have two 7s already taken
so<00:02:51.180> it's<00:02:51.360> my<00:02:51.510> turn<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.990> choose<00:02:52.050> a<00:02:52.230> number<00:02:52.680> I

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
so it's my turn to choose a number I

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.000 
so it's my turn to choose a number I
have<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.490> be<00:02:53.580> careful<00:02:54.000> let's<00:02:54.630> say<00:02:54.870> I<00:02:54.900> chose<00:02:55.320> 19

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
have to be careful let's say I chose 19

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.780 
have to be careful let's say I chose 19
the<00:02:56.760> only<00:02:57.200> factor<00:02:58.200> pair<00:02:58.440> for<00:02:58.710> 19<00:02:59.190> would<00:02:59.430> be<00:02:59.580> 1

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
the only factor pair for 19 would be 1

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.020 
the only factor pair for 19 would be 1
in<00:03:00.000> 19<00:03:00.590> since<00:03:01.590> one's<00:03:01.860> already<00:03:02.250> taken<00:03:02.640> I'd<00:03:02.790> lose

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
in 19 since one's already taken I'd lose

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.240 
in 19 since one's already taken I'd lose
a<00:03:03.060> turn<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:03.630> not<00:03:03.780> get<00:03:03.990> any<00:03:04.170> points<00:03:04.440> so<00:03:04.920> I'm<00:03:05.070> not

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
a turn and not get any points so I'm not

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.010 
a turn and not get any points so I'm not
gonna<00:03:05.520> choose<00:03:05.910> 19<00:03:06.600> I'm<00:03:06.900> going<00:03:07.380> to<00:03:07.500> choose<00:03:07.770> 12

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
gonna choose 19 I'm going to choose 12

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.360 
gonna choose 19 I'm going to choose 12
okay<00:03:10.020> 12<00:03:11.360> well<00:03:12.360> let<00:03:13.020> me<00:03:13.200> find<00:03:13.560> those<00:03:13.830> factor

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
okay 12 well let me find those factor

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.860 
okay 12 well let me find those factor
pairs<00:03:14.780> 1<00:03:15.780> and<00:03:16.140> 12<00:03:16.800> and<00:03:17.550> it's<00:03:17.850> even<00:03:18.330> so<00:03:18.570> 2<00:03:18.630> goes

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
pairs 1 and 12 and it's even so 2 goes

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.680 
pairs 1 and 12 and it's even so 2 goes
in<00:03:19.350> there<00:03:19.620> 2<00:03:20.250> times<00:03:20.580> 6<00:03:22.130> 3<00:03:23.130> does<00:03:23.550> go<00:03:23.850> in<00:03:24.030> there<00:03:24.270> 3

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690
