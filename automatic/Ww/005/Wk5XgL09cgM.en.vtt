00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
right hello this is 24 toes and today

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.809 
right hello this is 24 toes and today
I'm<00:00:03.959> gonna<00:00:04.080> show<00:00:04.470> you<00:00:04.500> quick<00:00:04.890> tutorial<00:00:05.370> of<00:00:05.490> a

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
I'm gonna show you quick tutorial of a

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.179 
I'm gonna show you quick tutorial of a
minecart<00:00:06.509> stop-start<00:00:07.200> system<00:00:07.259> which<00:00:07.980> I've

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
minecart stop-start system which I've

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.180 
minecart stop-start system which I've
created<00:00:08.510> I've<00:00:09.510> seen<00:00:09.750> similar<00:00:10.290> ones<00:00:10.620> but<00:00:11.160> I

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
created I've seen similar ones but I

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.209 
created I've seen similar ones but I
think<00:00:11.580> I<00:00:11.820> prefer<00:00:12.090> this<00:00:12.330> one<00:00:12.480> for<00:00:13.049> uses<00:00:13.769> for<00:00:14.190> a

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
think I prefer this one for uses for a

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.900 
think I prefer this one for uses for a
rollercoaster<00:00:14.610> or<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.509> train<00:00:16.350> system<00:00:16.910> it's

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
rollercoaster or a train system it's

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.150 
rollercoaster or a train system it's
very<00:00:18.000> simple<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.660> create<00:00:18.690> here<00:00:19.470> I've<00:00:19.740> made<00:00:19.980> a

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
very simple to create here I've made a

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.320 
very simple to create here I've made a
quick<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:21.170> quick<00:00:22.699> demonstration<00:00:23.699> version

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
quick a quick demonstration version

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.849 
quick a quick demonstration version
instead<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:24.990> like<00:00:25.470> showing<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.769> whole

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
instead of like showing the whole

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.599 
instead of like showing the whole
rollercoaster<00:00:26.519> trip<00:00:27.740> so<00:00:28.740> yeah<00:00:28.890> I'm<00:00:29.099> just<00:00:29.189> sort

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
rollercoaster trip so yeah I'm just sort

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.920 
rollercoaster trip so yeah I'm just sort
of<00:00:29.699> time<00:00:31.219> right<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:32.640> here's<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.270> minecart

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
of time right so here's the minecart

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.250 
of time right so here's the minecart
here<00:00:34.260> if<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:35.010> can<00:00:35.160> get<00:00:35.309> in<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.520> there<00:00:35.760> we<00:00:35.820> go<00:00:35.910> and

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
here if I can get in it there we go and

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.569 
here if I can get in it there we go and
you<00:00:37.260> should<00:00:37.469> already<00:00:37.649> know<00:00:37.800> like<00:00:38.219> if<00:00:38.460> you

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
you should already know like if you

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.260 
you should already know like if you
wanna<00:00:39.739> unpowered<00:00:40.739> powered<00:00:41.430> rail<00:00:41.610> or<00:00:41.879> whatever

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
wanna unpowered powered rail or whatever

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.490 
wanna unpowered powered rail or whatever
they're<00:00:42.390> like<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.600> powered<00:00:42.930> rail<00:00:42.989> without<00:00:43.350> any

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
they're like a powered rail without any

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.560 
they're like a powered rail without any
power<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.070> will<00:00:44.250> stop<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.030> minecart

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
power to it it will stop the minecart

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.920 
power to it it will stop the minecart
so<00:00:46.440> this<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.710> like<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.950> holding<00:00:47.309> Bay<00:00:47.629> and<00:00:48.629> then

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
so this is like the holding Bay and then

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.619 
so this is like the holding Bay and then
to<00:00:49.260> make<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.649> start<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.280> just<00:00:50.309> power<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.940> while

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
to make it start you just power it while

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.990 
to make it start you just power it while
you<00:00:51.960> have<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.230> be<00:00:52.320> on<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.440> slope<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:53.640> has<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.910> be

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
you have to be on a slope it has to be

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.590 
you have to be on a slope it has to be
like<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.239> raised<00:00:54.750> one<00:00:55.110> otherwise<00:00:56.420> you<00:00:57.420> won't

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
like a raised one otherwise you won't

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.849 
like a raised one otherwise you won't
move<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.469> won't<00:00:58.649> start<00:00:58.890> moving<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.550> and<00:01:00.859> so

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
move and it won't start moving it and so

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.349 
move and it won't start moving it and so
that<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.280> pretty<00:01:02.460> much<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.760> as<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:02.969> can<00:01:03.059> see<00:01:03.120> it

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
that is pretty much it as you can see it

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.820 
that is pretty much it as you can see it
starts<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.780> stops<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.379> then<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.650> push<00:01:04.799> the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
starts and stops and then you push the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.530 
starts and stops and then you push the
button<00:01:05.070> again<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.280> it'll<00:01:05.670> go<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:07.939> so<00:01:08.939> just

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
button again and it'll go and so just

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.800 
button again and it'll go and so just
show<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:10.560> quick<00:01:11.070> basics<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:12.299> circuit

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
show you the quick basics this circuit

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.840 
show you the quick basics this circuit
can<00:01:12.840> be<00:01:13.020> anything<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.500> want<00:01:13.860> like<00:01:14.130> a

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
can be anything you want like a

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.670 
can be anything you want like a
rollercoaster<00:01:15.180> or<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:16.170> train<00:01:17.750> loop<00:01:18.750> but<00:01:19.530> the

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
rollercoaster or a train loop but the

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.999 
rollercoaster or a train loop but the
main<00:01:19.950> part<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.340> need<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:21.060> just<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:22.710> simple

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
main part you need is just this simple

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.179 
main part you need is just this simple
basically<00:01:23.909> this<00:01:24.229> raises<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.409> up<00:01:25.560> gives<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.159> a

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
basically this raises it up gives it a

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.760 
basically this raises it up gives it a
bit<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.460> boost<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:27.330> get<00:01:27.479> up<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.869> then<00:01:28.350> the

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
bit of a boost to get up and then the

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.810 
bit of a boost to get up and then the
minecart<00:01:29.189> will<00:01:29.280> stop<00:01:29.610> on<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.030> powered<00:01:30.720> rails

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
minecart will stop on the powered rails

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.760 
minecart will stop on the powered rails
which<00:01:32.820> don't<00:01:33.150> have<00:01:33.360> by<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.110> redstone<00:01:34.530> rails

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
which don't have by the redstone rails

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.870 
which don't have by the redstone rails
which<00:01:34.950> don't<00:01:35.130> know<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.250> power<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.579> them<00:01:35.869> and

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
which don't know the power to them and

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.940 
which don't know the power to them and
that<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:38.970> about<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.360> for<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.439> need<00:01:40.860> about

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
that is about it for that you need about

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.850 
that is about it for that you need about
three<00:01:41.340> powered<00:01:42.240> rails<00:01:42.450> for<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.740> actually

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
three powered rails for it to actually

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.350 
three powered rails for it to actually
stop<00:01:44.220> because<00:01:44.490> when<00:01:44.640> you're<00:01:44.759> inside<00:01:45.119> the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
stop because when you're inside the

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.010 
stop because when you're inside the
minecart

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
minecart

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.249 
minecart
it<00:01:46.079> has<00:01:46.350> more<00:01:46.649> momentum<00:01:47.689> so<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.750> need<00:01:48.960> like<00:01:49.229> a

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
it has more momentum so you need like a

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.780 
it has more momentum so you need like a
longer<00:01:49.880> piece<00:01:50.880> thing<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.689> stop<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:53.579> yeah

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
longer piece thing to stop you so yeah

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.050 
longer piece thing to stop you so yeah
you<00:01:54.360> can<00:01:54.509> have<00:01:54.960> any<00:01:55.350> sort<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:56.040> can<00:01:56.790> put<00:01:56.969> the

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
you can have any sort of you can put the

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.170 
you can have any sort of you can put the
button<00:01:57.390> wherever<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.140> want<00:01:58.399> but<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.670> actual

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
button wherever you want but the actual

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.209 
button wherever you want but the actual
stopping<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.229> starting<00:02:01.380> system<00:02:01.649> has<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.189> be

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
stopping and starting system has to be

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:08.680 
stopping and starting system has to be
the<00:02:02.820> same<00:02:03.590> so<00:02:04.590> I'll<00:02:04.799> show<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.189> this<00:02:05.399> quickly

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.400 

I'm<00:02:09.140> stuck<00:02:09.470> running<00:02:09.830> okay<00:02:11.020> yeah<00:02:12.020> this<00:02:12.140> is<00:02:12.290> like

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
I'm stuck running okay yeah this is like

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.320 
I'm stuck running okay yeah this is like
a<00:02:12.470> rollercoaster<00:02:12.770> thing<00:02:13.370> you<00:02:13.430> know<00:02:13.550> if<00:02:13.910> you've

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
a rollercoaster thing you know if you've

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.450 
a rollercoaster thing you know if you've
ever<00:02:14.510> been<00:02:14.780> to<00:02:14.840> a<00:02:15.110> theme<00:02:15.320> park<00:02:15.350> or<00:02:16.130> roller

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
ever been to a theme park or roller

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.160 
ever been to a theme park or roller
coaster<00:02:16.910> where<00:02:17.300> the<00:02:17.450> guy<00:02:17.540> just<00:02:17.840> stands<00:02:18.020> there

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
coaster where the guy just stands there

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.110 
coaster where the guy just stands there
like<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.220> most<00:02:19.370> boring<00:02:19.520> job<00:02:19.820> in<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:19.970> world

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
like the most boring job in the world

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.820 
like the most boring job in the world
just<00:02:20.270> pushes<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:20.750> button<00:02:21.020> and<00:02:21.230> then<00:02:21.500> it<00:02:21.620> sets

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
just pushes the button and then it sets

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.270 
just pushes the button and then it sets
it<00:02:22.010> off<00:02:22.130> so<00:02:23.110> yeah<00:02:24.110> I<00:02:24.320> think<00:02:24.500> it's<00:02:24.770> quite<00:02:24.890> a<00:02:24.980> good

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
it off so yeah I think it's quite a good

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.890 
it off so yeah I think it's quite a good
little<00:02:26.290> way<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:27.350> sort<00:02:27.830> of<00:02:28.630> never<00:02:29.630> know<00:02:29.750> what's

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
little way to sort of never know what's

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.440 
little way to sort of never know what's
owner<00:02:30.110> yeah<00:02:31.100> it's<00:02:31.430> just<00:02:31.580> basically<00:02:31.940> you<00:02:32.300> can

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
owner yeah it's just basically you can

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.270 
owner yeah it's just basically you can
stop<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:32.840> minecart<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:33.440> it<00:02:33.500> started<00:02:33.950> however

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
stop the minecart and it started however

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.460 
stop the minecart and it started however
you<00:02:34.370> like<00:02:34.640> you<00:02:34.970> can<00:02:35.120> make<00:02:35.300> it<00:02:35.480> automatic<00:02:35.600> by

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
you like you can make it automatic by

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.520 
you like you can make it automatic by
adding<00:02:36.950> like<00:02:37.100> a<00:02:37.130> redstone<00:02:37.790> repeater<00:02:38.530> part

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
adding like a redstone repeater part

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.040 
adding like a redstone repeater part
where<00:02:40.490> it<00:02:40.880> will<00:02:41.030> like<00:02:41.210> turn<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.570> rails<00:02:41.780> on

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
where it will like turn the rails on

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.530 
where it will like turn the rails on
then<00:02:42.620> off<00:02:42.860> for<00:02:43.340> like<00:02:43.460> a<00:02:43.670> couple<00:02:43.820> seconds<00:02:44.450> and

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
then off for like a couple seconds and

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.050 
then off for like a couple seconds and
on<00:02:44.750> and<00:02:45.020> off<00:02:45.170> so<00:02:45.500> if<00:02:45.890> you're<00:02:46.610> having<00:02:46.760> like<00:02:46.880> a

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
on and off so if you're having like a

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.570 
on and off so if you're having like a
train<00:02:47.300> system<00:02:47.590> then<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.800> trick<00:02:49.040> like<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.370> car

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
train system then the trick like the car

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.120 
train system then the trick like the car
will<00:02:49.880> pull<00:02:50.150> up<00:02:50.330> then<00:02:50.900> stop<00:02:51.230> like<00:02:51.470> five<00:02:51.680> seconds

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
will pull up then stop like five seconds

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.590 
will pull up then stop like five seconds
then<00:02:52.400> pull<00:02:52.640> away<00:02:52.730> so<00:02:52.880> it<00:02:53.090> gives<00:02:53.210> people<00:02:53.390> time

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
then pull away so it gives people time

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.700 
then pull away so it gives people time
to<00:02:53.810> get<00:02:54.080> in<00:02:54.290> or<00:02:54.530> out<00:02:55.330> so<00:02:56.440> yeah<00:02:57.440> that's<00:02:57.650> pretty

guys will need like a walk through how

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.850 
guys will need like a walk through how
