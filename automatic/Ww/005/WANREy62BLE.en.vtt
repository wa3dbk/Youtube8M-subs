 How can I have a perfect day today 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:15.430
 I received it in Nozawa Masako who is one of the most respected seniors

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:34.910
 If you'll Dragon Ball What I was I am allowed to use excessive Yeah it is 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:36.680
 The work is the longest, but the needle's masako says the career 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:42.020
 It's different from it already 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:43.010
 Well everyone who is listening to you also young people if you probably want to hear that 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.170
 I'm thinking 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:51.449
 It is a sign that you say that it is the cause that became a good voice actor 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:57.510
 I can hear you well but I say that I wanted to be a voice actor 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:01:03.869
 Yes, of course I like to play from the net I like the stage Akira 3 cups people 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.979
 In a theater company, it's okay to lose that income , but I 'm worried but I've got an appointment day now 

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:06.190
 But it is not 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:12.430
 In honcho 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:15.490
 I did a drum of the rain, so it's not the first time, so I'm going to live in a live production in the meantime 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:22.800
 I boy was out when is entered and did you have iso 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:22.800
 Because the boy is not out of raw production is a high-test not you can not use a voice in it 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.380
 I think Buber is my first choice 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:49.420
 The true identity of the producer camp 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:55.000
 Is likely to come in handy to a boy Women's white wings stand up and each theater group hai production Haou 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:02:01.370
 There is talk of audition and if it is an excluded theater, it will be about effect clothes in major Shanghai 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:04.610
 It passed I was Yes only of it array in started when Yoiya is I was good reputation 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:09.560
 A cited my acting'm a person breath 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:12.800
 Ogino looks like a yoga fan among the tea for me 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.880
 It is seen between tea and 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:19.780
 Subtitle male do this is so, rather than Yohai 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:23.140
 You'll hit me with a car , but it's going to be a city ​​of sense god 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:28.060
 Please hear the Japanese because 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:32.950
 Recent foreigner and this is due to the place where I heard so is it So what if I viewership went there

 Iunonko that Rassha' 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:42.769
 After all 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:47.959
 Such early days of the Ateloco and dogs are really in the early days, I guess so too 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:49.489
 Desukeredo also the other really that 2 minutes without any consciousness I mean bought trying to be that the voice actor 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:54.890

 If there is the Tteyuu before something of opportunity voice of work Once auditioned in 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.880
 so 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:04.010
 But I was mixed To first still think that a 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.700
 I hear I'm certain that he was overflowing No way I think and hit the outside their own animation 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.450
 It was 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:13.959
 Isn't it a special script? 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:15.110
 That all cuts were divided and they were too hard at first though they were too 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:20.420
 Also 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:24.170
 But do I see when I thought many of the raw production to say that I wish deep very Yes uhh Uuu' 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:27.790
 That's right Chichia Land and so are you right? 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:31.810
 That's right I can not say it until the turn comes 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:34.580

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:40.430

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.730
 the first 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:52.850
 It is the same as the crazy Tsukage production bumping production even if it goes on and on 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:56.870
 It's amazing, but it 's just a bus but it looks like 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:04:04.220
 Toka still dont brain or rather the other I think not even over Happening 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:12.840

 I said that he said what happened 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:28.699
 Prefecture 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:31.699
 I see, then, in the studio , you're in an older, senior-like dialogue 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:34.940
 While it is not helpful 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:38.930
 Is the person who was stabbed invites'm not no character aftermath 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.830

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:50.050
 I'm going to go back to that earlier story, but with that debut of my grandson at that time 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:54.080
 Do you remember that title? 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:57.470
 Everybody I mean yeah does not Have a nice day to remember at all 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:01.459
 Even if voice actor's aspirational person is yes 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:04.860
 Even if something like an arrow comes out, you can remember your big bit 

00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:09.449
 I am the stage yes yes 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:11.409

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:17.169

 Well America Hega Is that so? In what or desertion or ne its positive recommendation has So maybe like is still so 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:20.840
 Well , that's right 

00:05:19.239 --> 00:05:24.110
 Oh 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:28.010
 I see, even the work of an illusion 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:32.360
 I'm also listening to the raw book inside 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:34.699
 Most in the village Neun likely not healed anymore and also the other I Do something's right source song program 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:40.830
 It was introduced so much 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:46.530
 8 days that it did once I somehow somehow Nea so Then the human Shin di 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:51.650
 Because there is no sense of security in women who have someone for some reason a boy has come out at that time 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:56.990
 I see, I can not do the appearance of drums 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:06:01.669
 I have to tell you why there is no danger of rehearsal 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.830
 It's not just a drama that's a face-to-face drama, so I'll do it for you. 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:08.740
 Oh 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:09.100

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.630

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:17.370
 So a simple but I voice of work in the theater 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:22.380
 Because I can not be 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:28.470
 I see that there is a historical background and it happens to be there 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:30.810
 That 's the first voice actor who 's an actress named Masako who seems to have come to the bottom of the year 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:37.390
 Tsu Oh Na' called 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:42.280
 Pretty much everyone's went Niño 

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:45.400
 Money Well, that's what it is like to hear such things, but it's a stupid question 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:49.450
 It is not known how many books so far 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:52.030
 The other key is not if I say that I wonder if you have been cast anymore 

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:57.850
 I know some books 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:59.470
 The other mentioned earlier is left to Yayoi fire Datte also that personally I It is my own now memories 

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:03.790
 I told you that it was a little different 

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:06.620
 Well that the Hey-air Kitaro no Kitaro 

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:10.310

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:16.040

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:21.740

 I'd like to say I live roller black 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:33.030
 Well that's right-but that's why it won't be seen again for several years 

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:34.900
 But after all I saw it 

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:40.570
 Countryside wreck 

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:44.590
 It is said that it is on air is close to what is said in the series 

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:48.039
 I feel a little bit clearer what I feel but I do not remember 

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:53.169

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:01.550
 Monter
