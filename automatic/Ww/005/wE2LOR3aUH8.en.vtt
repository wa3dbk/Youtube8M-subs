00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.070
 and hi to all his friends it's phoenix 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.290
 and today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.610
 little tutorial to use the police 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.100
 of pata girl writing so that's 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.050
 will look pretty much like that or that one 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.020
 as you wish first 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.540
 when we start we photoshop that I 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.410
 know that this way for you to do it 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:37.660
 so does this file new width 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.540
 1080 pixels height it's in vain that 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.520
 it's mostly 72 and white you to be 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.140
 transparencies for example saved a 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.430
 pnj to put it on another image 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:57.100
 how did I do it so you make a 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:59.469
 text to help is the police 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.050
 writing his curlers hunting increases 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:04.330
 a little hot I would put it in 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:09.550
 download so to make it bigger 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:14.770
 control your shift and presto it's more 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:19.060
 pretty I think that's after you do 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:24.270
 control you press here you do 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:27.520
 Televisions modified to dilate six pixels 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.900
 then publishes you make a vocal 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.090
 take the color you want me 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:35.829
 I put black and you fill 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.530
 inside all the interior against the 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:40.270
 door or selected ones you take 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.670
 my calculations hoisted just below yeah 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.189
 it gives that then to do the facts 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.369
 like that on it when ball 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:52.079
 if the small hatches you make 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:55.060
 files new width six authors 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.460
 6.72 and transparent is doing well 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.110
 transparent we will taste glitch then 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.259
 to donors like that it's not very 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.700
 pretty you zoom effect magnifying glass 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.979
 at home to advocate the rectangle tool 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.369
 selection advocates about half 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:12.550
 take a color me I have blue and 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:18.300
 now that's actually controlling well 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:21.280
 apologies and I cheated on it again 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.000
 must control it to 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.330
 when I did this fresh editing 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.240
 used as motif m pattern 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:36.330
 and that's how he could say 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:38.830
 his tour if you redo the 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:43.420
 Meme it checks there ssus or someone actually 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:46.569
 selection modified dilate 6 take the 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:50.620
 little round dot two motifs and the 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.640
 last is that that it gives that it's 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:57.480
 not very pretty 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.480
 for the pity ok ago and you clear 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:04.630
 Then if you want to see and the 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:09.069
 replant white what you want 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:11.680
 you make sin save under in 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:17.610
 white jpeg or if you do not want the 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.610
 white weather pnj png what she wanted 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.560
 and there and after if we wanted it to be 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.360
 transparent to put it on others 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.160
 other pictures like I did here you 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.239
 put me a transparent background she passes 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.910
 not white as being transparent 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.959
 reflects the same manipulation and so that's for 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.530
 the crazy half do not need to the 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.380
 do it every time 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:42.340
 so after they are still here it's 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.570
