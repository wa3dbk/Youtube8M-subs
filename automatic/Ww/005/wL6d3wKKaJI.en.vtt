 where the 16 best teams in the world fight for 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.230
 a champion title just a few years ago 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.630
 at the first international prize pool 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.010

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.779
 first place already got one 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.670
 million dollars well and on the fifth 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.340
 international players will fight for 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.289
 a record high prize pool of as many as 17 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.030
