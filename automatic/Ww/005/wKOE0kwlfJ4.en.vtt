that<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.500> parasite<00:01:40.979> now<00:01:41.280> as<00:01:41.689> integrated

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
that the parasite now as integrated

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.179

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
they are similar they're like the two of

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.420 
they are similar they're like the two of
a<00:01:56.850> whole<00:01:57.030> coins<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.719> so<00:01:57.899> forth<00:01:58.259> America<00:01:59.219> so<00:01:59.340> we

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
a whole coins and so forth America so we

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.310 
a whole coins and so forth America so we
are<00:01:59.520> getting<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.939> see<00:02:00.630> what<00:02:00.659> her

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
are getting to see what her

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.490 
are getting to see what her
comprehension<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.820> that<00:02:03.030> was<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:04.079> the

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
comprehension of that was that the

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.920 
comprehension of that was that the
humans<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.369> parasite<00:02:05.820> are<00:02:06.030> similar<00:02:06.509> in<00:02:06.659> some

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
humans and parasite are similar in some

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.809 
humans and parasite are similar in some
form<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:07.770> this<00:02:07.920> episode<00:02:08.099> was<00:02:08.459> basically
