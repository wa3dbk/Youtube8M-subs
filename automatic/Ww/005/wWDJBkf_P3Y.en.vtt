00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.370 
and the various radars are tracking the
pieces<00:01:06.320> of<00:01:06.500> the<00:01:06.590> rocket<00:01:06.950> at<00:01:07.040> this<00:01:07.220> time<00:01:08.380> we

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.170 
pieces of the rocket at this time we
would<00:01:09.590> ask<00:01:09.800> at<00:01:10.009> this<00:01:10.130> time<00:01:10.190> that<00:01:10.640> everyone<00:01:10.850> do

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
stay remain in their current locations

00:01:13.640 --> 00:02:00.800

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
again we did have a Matic failure of the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.380 
again we did have a Matic failure of the
vehicle<00:02:03.840> during<00:02:04.020> flight
