I guess let's bust

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.250 
I guess let's bust
just<00:02:49.590> grab<00:02:49.889> your<00:02:49.920> open<00:02:50.510> and<00:02:51.510> you<00:02:51.720> know<00:02:51.810> guys<00:02:52.019> I

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
just grab your open and you know guys I

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.229 
just grab your open and you know guys I
think<00:02:52.290> I<00:02:52.680> might<00:02:52.919> eventually<00:02:53.069> invest<00:02:53.849> into<00:02:54.090> a

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
think I might eventually invest into a

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.729 
think I might eventually invest into a
better<00:02:54.569> microphone<00:02:54.750> for<00:02:55.139> my<00:02:55.260> camera<00:02:55.470> I<00:02:55.680> think

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
better microphone for my camera I think

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.009 
better microphone for my camera I think
it<00:02:55.950> sounds<00:02:56.189> ok<00:02:56.459> but<00:02:56.700> I<00:02:56.879> do<00:02:57.180> get<00:02:57.450> some<00:02:57.599> random

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
it sounds ok but I do get some random

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.619 
it sounds ok but I do get some random
piece<00:02:58.379> ounds<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:58.859> stuff<00:02:59.040> in<00:02:59.189> there<00:02:59.310> so

00:02:59.619 --> 00:02:59.629 
piece ounds and stuff in there so

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:02.300 
piece ounds and stuff in there so
hopefully<00:03:00.629> I<00:03:00.989> can<00:03:01.169> do<00:03:01.680> that<00:03:01.709> soon<00:03:02.010> I<00:03:02.250> just

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
hopefully I can do that soon I just

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.649 
hopefully I can do that soon I just
