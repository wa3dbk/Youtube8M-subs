00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.729 
grenadine now a lot of people have the
misconception<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.790> grenadine<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.020> cherry

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
misconception that grenadine is a cherry

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.040 
misconception that grenadine is a cherry
based<00:00:37.950> syrup<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.730> actually<00:00:38.879> comes<00:00:39.180> from<00:00:39.329> the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
based syrup it actually comes from the

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.220 
based syrup it actually comes from the
the<00:00:40.500> base<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.190> pomegranate<00:00:41.760> flavor<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.809> the

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
the base is a pomegranate flavor the the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.069 
the base is a pomegranate flavor the the
French<00:00:43.800> word<00:00:44.010> for<00:00:44.040> pomegranate<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.059> Renaud<00:00:45.570> so

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
French word for pomegranate is Renaud so

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.610 
French word for pomegranate is Renaud so
that's<00:00:46.230> where<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.879> grenadine<00:00:47.879> gets<00:00:48.120> its<00:00:48.270> name

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
that's where the grenadine gets its name

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.810 
that's where the grenadine gets its name
now<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.710> might<00:00:49.860> be<00:00:49.950> thinking<00:00:49.980> based<00:00:50.550> on<00:00:50.730> the

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
now you might be thinking based on the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.490 
now you might be thinking based on the
ingredients<00:00:51.210> we<00:00:51.300> have<00:00:51.420> up<00:00:51.539> here<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.960> tequila

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
ingredients we have up here the tequila

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.160 
ingredients we have up here the tequila
and<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.920> citrus<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.600> ingredients<00:00:55.079> are

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
and the citrus that the ingredients are

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.750 
and the citrus that the ingredients are
indicative<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.920> margarita<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.550> you

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
indicative of the margarita and you

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.619 
indicative of the margarita and you
would<00:00:56.850> be<00:00:56.879> correctly<00:00:57.239> making<00:00:57.510> that

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
would be correctly making that

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.930 
would be correctly making that
assumption<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.829> literal<00:00:59.309> translation<00:00:59.460> of

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
assumption the literal translation of

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.639 
assumption the literal translation of
the<00:01:00.030> word<00:01:00.059> margarita<00:01:00.660> in<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.350> English

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
the word margarita in the English

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.490 
the word margarita in the English
language<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:02.219> Daisy<00:01:03.180> so<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.840> argument<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.470> a

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
language is Daisy so the argument that a

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.649 
language is Daisy so the argument that a
margarita<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.280> actually<00:01:05.640> an<00:01:05.850> evolved<00:01:06.270> form<00:01:06.299> of

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
margarita is actually an evolved form of

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.630 
margarita is actually an evolved form of
the<00:01:06.990> tequila<00:01:07.320> Daisy<00:01:07.530> would<00:01:08.280> be<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.430> good

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
the tequila Daisy would be a good

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.490 
the tequila Daisy would be a good
argument<00:01:08.820> ok<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.780> tequila<00:01:10.080> Daisy<00:01:10.260> we're
