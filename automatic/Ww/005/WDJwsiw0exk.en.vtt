00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
opinion was um the way it didn't alcorn

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.819 
opinion was um the way it didn't alcorn
to<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.390> trailer<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.869> lot<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.049> people<00:01:49.200> saying<00:01:49.619> it

didn't really look like in action RPG it
more<00:01:52.920> look<00:01:53.070> like<00:01:53.250> in<00:01:53.430> an<00:01:54.090> action<00:01:54.299> adventure

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.569 
more like a hack-and-slash thing where
it's<00:01:57.630> not<00:01:57.869> as<00:01:57.990> much<00:01:58.140> customization<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:59.340> maybe

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
it's not as much customization and maybe

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.730 
it's not as much customization and maybe
that<00:02:00.420> character<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.049> seen<00:02:01.259> in<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.469> trailer

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
that character you seen in the trailer

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.990 
that character you seen in the trailer
is<00:02:01.890> going<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.130> be<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.310> protagonist<00:02:02.670> and

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
is going to be the protagonist and

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.289 
is going to be the protagonist and
that's<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.439> in<00:02:04.439> my<00:02:04.680> opinion<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.460> is<00:02:05.520> true<00:02:06.060> like

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
that's it in my opinion it is true like

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.839 
that's it in my opinion it is true like
that<00:02:07.229> trailer<00:02:07.619> did<00:02:07.890> give<00:02:08.129> me<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.429> kind<00:02:08.700> of

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
that trailer did give me that kind of

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.809 
that trailer did give me that kind of
feeling<00:02:09.209> as<00:02:09.450> well<00:02:09.660> but<00:02:09.989> but<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.860> be<00:02:10.979> fair

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
feeling as well but but to be fair

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.119 
feeling as well but but to be fair
a<00:02:11.879> phone<00:02:12.810> software<00:02:13.019> do<00:02:13.319> do<00:02:13.499> this<00:02:13.739> even<00:02:14.040> in

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
a phone software do do this even in

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:15.739 
a phone software do do this even in
doses<00:02:14.519> to<00:02:14.670> like<00:02:14.819> if<00:02:14.969> you<00:02:15.060> go<00:02:15.209> to<00:02:15.269> doctors<00:02:15.719> to

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:15.749 
doses to like if you go to doctors to

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:18.259 
doses to like if you go to doctors to
the<00:02:16.049> protagonist<00:02:16.349> did<00:02:16.769> have<00:02:17.099> only<00:02:17.760> the

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
the protagonist did have only the

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.770 
the protagonist did have only the
Pharaon<00:02:18.870> armor<00:02:19.469> and<00:02:19.730> whatnot<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:20.909> I<00:02:21.599> think

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
Pharaon armor and whatnot and I think

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.149 
Pharaon armor and whatnot and I think
I've<00:02:21.870> seen<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.139> same<00:02:22.290> dose<00:02:22.560> one<00:02:22.920> if<00:02:23.040> i

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
I've seen the same dose one if i

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:24.530 
I've seen the same dose one if i
remember<00:02:23.310> correctly<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:23.909> obviously<00:02:24.450> you

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
remember correctly and obviously you

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.119 
remember correctly and obviously you
could<00:02:24.900> customize<00:02:25.109> it<00:02:25.439> as<00:02:25.499> much<00:02:25.650> as<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:25.859> want

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
could customize it as much as you want

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:27.500 
could customize it as much as you want
and<00:02:26.219> you<00:02:26.280> could<00:02:26.459> use<00:02:26.670> any<00:02:26.819> what<00:02:27.060> you<00:02:27.150> want<00:02:27.359> I

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
and you could use any what you want I

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.030 
and you could use any what you want I
mean<00:02:27.840> in<00:02:27.930> my<00:02:28.049> opinion<00:02:28.290> I<00:02:28.409> think<00:02:28.439> they<00:02:28.709> just<00:02:28.739> put

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
mean in my opinion I think they just put

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.280 
mean in my opinion I think they just put
that<00:02:29.069> kind<00:02:29.340> of<00:02:29.459> flip<00:02:30.209> out<00:02:30.420> sites<00:02:30.780> or<00:02:31.079> whatever

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
that kind of flip out sites or whatever

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.059 
that kind of flip out sites or whatever
was<00:02:31.500> hidden<00:02:31.709> in<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.579> blood-borne<00:02:33.510> trailer<00:02:34.069> is

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
was hidden in the blood-borne trailer is

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.339 
was hidden in the blood-borne trailer is
it<00:02:35.219> a<00:02:35.250> little<00:02:35.489> cool<00:02:35.819> isn't<00:02:36.060> something<00:02:36.629> new<00:02:36.659> so

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
it a little cool isn't something new so

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.110 
it a little cool isn't something new so
in<00:02:37.799> my<00:02:38.099> opinion<00:02:38.219> I<00:02:38.430> think<00:02:38.459> you<00:02:38.730> will<00:02:38.909> be<00:02:39.090> able

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
in my opinion I think you will be able

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.909 
in my opinion I think you will be able
to<00:02:39.329> customize<00:02:39.659> it<00:02:39.689> just<00:02:40.109> as<00:02:40.260> much<00:02:40.290> as<00:02:40.469> in<00:02:40.739> dog

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:40.919 
to customize it just as much as in dog

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:44.780 
to customize it just as much as in dog
shows<00:02:41.959> rather<00:02:42.959> either<00:02:43.349> will<00:02:43.680> be<00:02:43.859> an<00:02:44.010> RPG<00:02:44.549> as

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
shows rather either will be an RPG as

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.030 
shows rather either will be an RPG as
much<00:02:45.090> as<00:02:45.299> that<00:02:45.480> shows<00:02:45.750> or<00:02:46.109> not<00:02:46.439> I<00:02:46.620> don't<00:02:46.919> know

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
much as that shows or not I don't know

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.939 
much as that shows or not I don't know
I'm<00:02:47.310> guessing<00:02:48.019> there<00:02:49.019> will<00:02:49.049> be<00:02:49.530> but<00:02:49.799> it

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:49.949 
I'm guessing there will be but it

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:51.170 
I'm guessing there will be but it
definitely<00:02:50.159> looks<00:02:50.519> like<00:02:50.609> what<00:02:50.909> the<00:02:51.000> game

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
definitely looks like what the game

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.059 
definitely looks like what the game
where<00:02:51.389> is<00:02:51.629> there's<00:02:52.260> not<00:02:52.379> gonna<00:02:52.500> be<00:02:52.590> much<00:02:52.650> heavy

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
where is there's not gonna be much heavy

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.189 
where is there's not gonna be much heavy
armor<00:02:53.519> like<00:02:53.790> havells<00:02:54.389> or<00:02:54.599> anything<00:02:54.930> like<00:02:54.959> that

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:55.199 
armor like havells or anything like that

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:56.869 
armor like havells or anything like that
if<00:02:55.409> you<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:56.040> looks<00:02:56.280> more<00:02:56.430> fast-paced

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
if you it looks more fast-paced

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:58.369 
if you it looks more fast-paced
especially<00:02:57.510> if<00:02:57.569> you're<00:02:57.659> gonna<00:02:57.750> have<00:02:57.930> guns<00:02:58.199> I

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
especially if you're gonna have guns I

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:59.599 
especially if you're gonna have guns I
mean<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:58.620> don't<00:02:58.739> really<00:02:59.040> make<00:02:59.129> sense<00:02:59.340> that<00:02:59.549> you

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
mean it don't really make sense that you

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.250 
mean it don't really make sense that you
going<00:02:59.730> to<00:02:59.790> go<00:02:59.909> around<00:03:00.180> we<00:03:00.269> were<00:03:00.389> gone<00:03:00.599> web

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
going to go around we were gone web

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.720 
going to go around we were gone web
something<00:03:01.769> like<00:03:01.889> have<00:03:02.129> was<00:03:02.310> on<00:03:02.459> one<00:03:02.639> or

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
something like have was on one or

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.039 
something like have was on one or
something<00:03:03.030> like<00:03:03.090> that<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.449> think<00:03:03.810> you<00:03:03.900> know<00:03:04.019> I

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
something like that I think you know I

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.009 
something like that I think you know I
mean<00:03:04.290> that<00:03:04.889> was<00:03:05.010> one<00:03:05.159> of<00:03:05.189> the<00:03:05.280> main<00:03:06.019> concerns

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
mean that was one of the main concerns

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.949 
mean that was one of the main concerns
within<00:03:07.439> the<00:03:07.620> community<00:03:08.389> the<00:03:09.389> other<00:03:09.599> one<00:03:09.750> was

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
within the community the other one was

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.649 
within the community the other one was
uh<00:03:10.139> it<00:03:11.129> definitely<00:03:11.699> feels<00:03:11.939> like<00:03:12.150> Dark<00:03:12.540> Souls

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
uh it definitely feels like Dark Souls

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.300 
uh it definitely feels like Dark Souls
with<00:03:13.109> the<00:03:13.230> horror<00:03:13.500> thing<00:03:13.769> but<00:03:13.949> I<00:03:14.010> think<00:03:14.219> they

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
with the horror thing but I think they

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.709 
with the horror thing but I think they
went<00:03:14.430> over<00:03:14.639> the<00:03:14.760> top<00:03:14.969> a<00:03:15.030> lot<00:03:15.329> of<00:03:15.419> people<00:03:15.629> were

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:15.719 
went over the top a lot of people were

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:17.390 
went over the top a lot of people were
saying<00:03:15.930> that<00:03:16.169> but<00:03:16.650> I<00:03:16.739> don't<00:03:16.919> think<00:03:17.159> so<00:03:17.310> I<00:03:17.340> mean

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
saying that but I don't think so I mean

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.809 
saying that but I don't think so I mean
if<00:03:17.579> you<00:03:17.699> go<00:03:17.819> back<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:18.030> look<00:03:18.209> at<00:03:18.419> dog<00:03:18.629> shows<00:03:18.659> one

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
if you go back and look at dog shows one

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:23.149 
if you go back and look at dog shows one
it<00:03:20.819> does<00:03:21.180> look<00:03:21.209> just<00:03:21.659> as<00:03:22.049> dark<00:03:22.349> is<00:03:22.560> that<00:03:22.769> I<00:03:22.799> mean

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:23.159 
it does look just as dark is that I mean

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:24.619 
it does look just as dark is that I mean
and<00:03:23.430> I<00:03:23.549> think<00:03:23.729> they<00:03:23.819> made<00:03:23.970> a<00:03:24.000> lot<00:03:24.239> was<00:03:24.389> in<00:03:24.569> the

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:24.629 
and I think they made a lot was in the

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:26.449 
and I think they made a lot was in the
trailer<00:03:25.049> so<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:25.680> be<00:03:25.859> honest<00:03:26.099> that's<00:03:26.280> not

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
trailer so to be honest that's not

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:27.740 
trailer so to be honest that's not
really<00:03:26.669> much<00:03:26.759> of<00:03:26.819> a<00:03:26.970> concern<00:03:27.180> to<00:03:27.509> me<00:03:27.629> awhile

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
really much of a concern to me awhile

gameplay<00:03:33.090> in<00:03:33.689> the<00:03:34.439> e3<00:03:35.009> trailer<00:03:35.189> since<00:03:35.669> like

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:35.909 
gameplay in the e3 trailer since like

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:38.449 
gameplay in the e3 trailer since like
this<00:03:36.060> being<00:03:36.359> leaked<00:03:36.870> gameplay<00:03:37.220> videos<00:03:38.220> from

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
this being leaked gameplay videos from

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.399 
this being leaked gameplay videos from
before<00:03:38.909> and<00:03:39.120> it<00:03:39.659> definitely<00:03:39.840> looked<00:03:40.139> like<00:03:40.199> it

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:40.409 
before and it definitely looked like it

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:42.259 
before and it definitely looked like it
was<00:03:40.530> from<00:03:40.620> a<00:03:40.799> trailer<00:03:41.099> so<00:03:41.459> I'm<00:03:41.879> not<00:03:42.090> sure<00:03:42.150> if

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
was from a trailer so I'm not sure if

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:43.789 
was from a trailer so I'm not sure if
they<00:03:42.449> scrapped<00:03:42.870> that<00:03:42.900> idea<00:03:43.109> because<00:03:43.560> it<00:03:43.590> got

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
they scrapped that idea because it got

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.789 
they scrapped that idea because it got
leaked<00:03:44.069> or<00:03:44.220> whatever<00:03:44.489> or<00:03:44.909> they<00:03:45.750> are<00:03:46.079> saving<00:03:46.709> it

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
leaked or whatever or they are saving it

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.619 
leaked or whatever or they are saving it
for<00:03:47.040> a<00:03:47.069> later<00:03:47.489> date<00:03:47.849> or<00:03:48.120> something<00:03:48.569> like

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:48.629 
for a later date or something like

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:50.390 
for a later date or something like
gameplay<00:03:49.109> trailer<00:03:49.409> before<00:03:49.650> it<00:03:49.829> comes<00:03:50.040> out<00:03:50.189> or

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
gameplay trailer before it comes out or

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.550 
gameplay trailer before it comes out or
something<00:03:50.849> I<00:03:51.569> don't<00:03:51.930> know<00:03:52.049> about<00:03:52.109> that<00:03:52.319> but

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
something I don't know about that but

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.080 
something I don't know about that but
hopefully<00:03:52.979> we'll<00:03:53.069> be<00:03:53.159> seeing<00:03:53.370> some<00:03:53.579> gameplay

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
hopefully we'll be seeing some gameplay

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.659 
hopefully we'll be seeing some gameplay
even<00:03:54.719> if<00:03:54.810> it's<00:03:54.930> in<00:03:55.049> the<00:03:55.139> trailer<00:03:55.409> soon<00:03:55.979> and

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:56.669 
even if it's in the trailer soon and

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.369 
even if it's in the trailer soon and
that<00:03:56.819> wants<00:03:57.120> a<00:03:57.209> few<00:03:57.389> more<00:03:57.569> questions<00:03:57.750> I<00:03:58.139> guess

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
that wants a few more questions I guess

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:00.580 
that wants a few more questions I guess
