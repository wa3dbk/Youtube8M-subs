turnigy<00:00:49.469> trailblazer<00:00:50.340> 1/8<00:00:51.030> scale<00:00:51.890> this<00:00:52.890> is

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
turnigy trailblazer 1/8 scale this is

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.099 
turnigy trailblazer 1/8 scale this is
however<00:00:55.219> yeah<00:00:56.539> according<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.629> their<00:00:57.780> numbers

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
however yeah according to their numbers

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:09.190 
however yeah according to their numbers
anyway<00:01:02.870> one-fifth<00:01:03.870> scale<00:01:04.909> so<00:01:07.700> doo-doo-doo

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
anyway one-fifth scale so doo-doo-doo

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.520 
anyway one-fifth scale so doo-doo-doo
it's<00:01:10.200> getting<00:01:10.530> sized<00:01:10.890> up<00:01:11.130> right<00:01:11.479> so<00:01:12.530> the

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
it's getting sized up right so the

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.960 
it's getting sized up right so the
Eternity<00:01:13.920> trailers<00:01:14.310> are<00:01:14.990> 1/8<00:01:15.990> scale<00:01:17.299> here<00:01:18.710> and

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
Eternity trailers are 1/8 scale here and

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.980 
Eternity trailers are 1/8 scale here and
one-fifth<00:01:20.970> scale<00:01:21.119> here<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.189> is

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
one-fifth scale here so it is

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.920 
one-fifth scale here so it is
considerably<00:01:24.990> larger<00:01:25.549> that's<00:01:26.549> for<00:01:26.850> sure<00:01:27.030> I'm

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
considerably larger that's for sure I'm

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.670 
considerably larger that's for sure I'm
expecting<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.920> see<00:01:29.240> basically<00:01:30.320> very<00:01:31.320> similar

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
expecting to see basically very similar

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.569 
expecting to see basically very similar

kilogram<00:02:24.580> steering<00:02:25.580> servo<00:02:26.410> so<00:02:27.410> granted<00:02:28.340> all

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
kilogram steering servo so granted all

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.700 
kilogram steering servo so granted all
right<00:02:28.820> you<00:02:29.000> know<00:02:29.090> all<00:02:29.240> things<00:02:29.420> aside<00:02:29.710> using

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
right you know all things aside using

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.160 
right you know all things aside using
the<00:02:30.980> term<00:02:31.190> fifth<00:02:31.550> scale<00:02:31.940> is<00:02:32.270> a<00:02:32.720> little

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
the term fifth scale is a little

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.020 
the term fifth scale is a little
misleading<00:02:33.380> although<00:02:34.100> you<00:02:34.820> know<00:02:34.940> it

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
misleading although you know it

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.130 
misleading although you know it
definitely<00:02:35.180> is<00:02:35.480> bigger<00:02:35.720> than<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:36.020> eighth

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
definitely is bigger than the eighth

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.250 
definitely is bigger than the eighth
scale<00:02:36.500> version<00:02:37.240> when<00:02:38.240> I<00:02:38.480> think<00:02:38.810> a<00:02:38.870> fifth<00:02:39.080> scale

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
scale version when I think a fifth scale

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.040 
scale version when I think a fifth scale
I<00:02:39.320> generally<00:02:40.010> think<00:02:40.040> of<00:02:40.400> like<00:02:41.060> Milo<00:02:41.360> c5<00:02:41.780> which

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
I generally think of like Milo c5 which

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.000 
I generally think of like Milo c5 which
was<00:02:42.230> like<00:02:42.440> twice<00:02:44.020> easily<00:02:45.020> two<00:02:45.200> times<00:02:45.710> bigger

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
was like twice easily two times bigger

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.760 
was like twice easily two times bigger
than<00:02:46.190> this<00:02:46.370> and<00:02:46.670> probably<00:02:47.500> five<00:02:48.500> times

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
than this and probably five times

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
than this and probably five times
heavier<00:02:49.220> than<00:02:49.280> this<00:02:49.960> but<00:02:50.960> I<00:02:51.430> don't<00:02:52.430> really<00:02:52.550> get

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
heavier than this but I don't really get

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.340 
heavier than this but I don't really get
too<00:02:53.000> caught<00:02:53.180> up<00:02:53.240> in<00:02:53.450> that<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.900> fact<00:02:54.140> of<00:02:54.260> the

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
this ESC and run to 3 s's but you know

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.730 
this ESC and run to 3 s's but you know
before<00:04:43.360> I<00:04:43.390> did<00:04:43.660> that<00:04:43.810> I'd<00:04:44.050> probably<00:04:44.290> upgrade

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
before I did that I'd probably upgrade

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.390 
before I did that I'd probably upgrade
the<00:04:44.860> steering<00:04:45.190> servo<00:04:45.370> and<00:04:46.950> that's<00:04:47.950> I<00:04:48.220> mean

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
the steering servo and that's I mean

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.760 
the steering servo and that's I mean
when<00:04:48.670> I<00:04:48.700> look<00:04:48.850> at<00:04:49.000> nine<00:04:49.180> kilograms<00:04:49.480> I<00:04:50.290> mean

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
when I look at nine kilograms I mean

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.790 
when I look at nine kilograms I mean
it's<00:04:50.920> probably<00:04:51.100> okay<00:04:51.670> but<00:04:52.510> uh<00:04:52.540> I<00:04:52.990> think<00:04:53.290> if<00:04:53.680> I

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
it's probably okay but uh I think if I

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.990 
it's probably okay but uh I think if I
was<00:04:53.890> gonna<00:04:54.010> spend<00:04:54.250> any<00:04:54.400> money<00:04:54.610> to<00:04:54.820> upgrade

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
was gonna spend any money to upgrade

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.200 
was gonna spend any money to upgrade

worrying about exactly how thick and a

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.790 
worrying about exactly how thick and a
arm<00:06:12.940> is<00:06:13.120> because<00:06:13.510> sometimes<00:06:13.840> that<00:06:13.960> plastics

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 
arm is because sometimes that plastics

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.090 
arm is because sometimes that plastics
just<00:06:15.010> really<00:06:15.220> brittle<00:06:15.520> and<00:06:16.740> that's<00:06:17.740> what

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:18.100 
just really brittle and that's what

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.380 
just really brittle and that's what
you're<00:06:18.220> where<00:06:18.340> you<00:06:18.460> end<00:06:18.580> up<00:06:18.700> breaking<00:06:18.820> it<00:06:19.150> more

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:19.390 
you're where you end up breaking it more

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:24.870 
you're where you end up breaking it more
so<00:06:19.600> than<00:06:19.780> just<00:06:19.810> having<00:06:20.260> like<00:06:20.670> thin<00:06:21.670> a<00:06:21.970> arms<00:06:23.880> all
