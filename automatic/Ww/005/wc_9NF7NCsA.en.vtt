00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 and welcome, be more friendly with what 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.609
 such are you lost well because also 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.470
 today I bring you another tutorial in danger 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.599
 flames and this time I bring reinhard 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.889
 good without saying more let's start 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.360
 explaining to buy it 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.639
 cousin skills like buying for 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.230
 go to the top so it can be the shield 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.580
 like the sword that I'm going to make and now 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.490
 same to go more aggressive 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.900
 to dictate a guard bottle is worth and 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.480
 also if you want to go more in jungle 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.300
 then the machete and two water boats with 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.320
 the passive skills 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.470
 the passive to avenge 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.600
 has two one is that when we jump from the 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.010
 moss in our next basic attack 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.450
 will have let's say more rank here you see 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.879
 that we get this round and if we remove 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.559
 right jump over the enemy and the 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.180
 another is that every time we use a 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.250
 ability but keep filling a stack 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.230
 Verzeri 025 if you keep giving us one worth 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.580
 and now I explain to you when we have the 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.650
 five then power our fifth 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.540
 skill now I tell you how and everything is 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.070
 the first thing we're going to say is the tail 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.470
 what it does is that our next 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.180
 basic attack because it does more damage to 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.329
 segment sedesol done like that so that what 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.520
 you understand easy and when we have the 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.050
 whole load is spent on the cv 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.090
 because the one we use an ability 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.800
 have five we can only spend what 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.600
 that we wanted all the time they were 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.670
 coming we will unlock first the 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.930
 what do we do like that and now it's not full 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.570
 because we have to throw it at someone 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.420
 obviously if not it would not be very easy 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.890
 so when we have it with 5 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.479
 we make one that increases our speed 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.460
 here we have life again 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.420
 we will have the ability not only 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.380
 with cooperation 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.030
 w is that now I would simply make a 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.060
 area around us that hurts 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.040
 but when we have it with 5 then yes 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.500
 if we give someone does not throw when the 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.390
 let's throw it away we have to be we have 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.950
 to fill giving someone also the 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.780
 area but when we have the five 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.220
 stacks and we miss you then more will be missing 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.690
 nobody because it's just going to cure us 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.460
 now a little the year probably we 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.100
 will heal the e 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.649
 when we launched the has this range here 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.060
 quite long the truth as we launch 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.479
 these and what he does is that when he plays 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.190
 someone slows down and is already a little hurt 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.220
 and when we have five then this 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.070
 United 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.229
 and the ultimate 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.759
 for what it does to us is that when 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.170
 we lay unseen Vale do 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.480
 this piece rank and in that range that 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.040
 You see here on the screen, it will be in the 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.370
 that we see people we were 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.500
 with the ultimate here and there is someone here 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.050
 Well we would see if we could jump 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.510
 because our range comes from leftovers and 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.010
 then another thing that is this from here 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.750
 ok is the collar tooth bone to the 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.310
 bone tooth necklace before was bought 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.770
 now they no longer propose us as in 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:38.030
 the trinquet that now that we got to that 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.470
 we kill be a trophy and three trophies 25 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.480
 lateral movement when this one when not 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.610
 we are fighting six trophies reach 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.860
 is to the ground increased in the last with 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.150
 the moss 12 trophies the duration of 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.230
 emotion 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:54.079
 and it increases 5 seconds whistler and that's 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.239
 it's basically what I'm going to teach is going 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.739
 filling being with now at level 6 yo 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.290
 I teach better because it is quite difficult 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.569
 explain it like this you can not see it now 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.519
 level 6 taught such as already white 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.430
 and we're already level 6 now I'm going to 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.450
 teach how they go with watering but a 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.889
 thing that you have to have clear the 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.530
 last they know when we are 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:15.290
 approaching to base the convoy to the 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.239
 used to make it faster you see that 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.160
 symbol that they are already on 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.590
 saying 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.060
 and here already for one thing that we have to 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.680
 to know is that when we are in stealth 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.300
 you will say how he has reacted so fast 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.310
 right now 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.920
 as regenerated also so fast 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.260
 snacks below without doing anything because it is 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.330
 that when we left the ultimate 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.220
 our our charges we call them 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.070
 we do loads of the last and 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.690
 our charges increase for five 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.640
 seconds if they are because a second 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.620
 for each load you put it what you read here is 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.300
 down the whole how much do you know about stealth 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.310
 you have 25 additional movement speed 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.070
 and regenerates the five of theory in five 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.020
 seconds or one charge per second and 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.030
 another thing is this one from here now we see 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.960
 that our jump range is longer 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.250
 because I'm going 60606 15 here before to 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.690
 you are very much that you can not deal 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.430
 is that he does this here if before if the 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.680
 guard before was bought then it is that 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.630
 first riotinto that for an item after 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.610
 put it in the guard guard's place 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.770
 had this this drawing takes place 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.380
 normal and now directly exposes it 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.910
 that over now something else first thing 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.760
 that we are going to improve is going to be the cv 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.340
 from paul wy after having worth and if 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.020
 all are given is enough so that at 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.280
 I'm a bit of a mess to understand 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.180
 you walk because basically it's like 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.680
 we had 3 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.680
 if we wanted to be singing 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:37.690
 and we will be back and save again 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:42.180
 because you have to know that now that 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.180
 we spent a stack of these 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.590
 to which we fill one the cool down of the 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.880
 next basic attack boosted not 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:54.590
 share the normal skill 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.240
 and lopez gives for what we have 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.830
 Of course, we can do it twice 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.470
 the crib with the speed movement 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.040
 increased by this and another rule the 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.890
 promotion 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:08.460
 we will start to hit very fast, ok, blah 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:11.390
 blah blah blah and another because it would be the w 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.390
 what would be cured 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:17.850
 just a moment 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.850
 and good to hear the images for what 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.550
 the day is the same as this but 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:26.910
 studying and how good I teach them 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:29.280
 complete this is the full voice of 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.199
 garments in this order that we have here 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.150
 the hydra is well the fan of the run win 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:35.310
 the ghostly end of jong 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.620
 the voices of martins and the angel of the 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.150
 it keeps this is one of the wild 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.009
 whoever comes to add has 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.620
 many other wheels would be for example 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:46.229
 in green the yogurt as people do 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.300
 the on the black blade instead of the 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:50.400
 fauces of more mortis and there is no worse 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.370
 you can calmly do the strength of 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:56.740
 the Trinity 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:06:01.550
 brings the activity of the truth is that 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:04.250
 it's more than anything to hold on, I know, but 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:08.050
 we have 285 damage which is what we 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:08.050
 like you can teach us 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.949
 the treat inside 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:20.669
 Without wanting to explain the 4 nothing happens 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:24.960
 in truth, I would not have to 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:27.289
 throw when we are with the load 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.300
 in that moment we have to throw him go 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:32.930
 we are here we have that speed 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.930
 An atrocity 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:41.770
 what we have here also 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:44.069
 the ball loaded with the tower I'm not going to 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.069
 have me 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.880
 I think yes you could hit push button 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.970
 we would be like me 

00:06:58.409 --> 00:07:05.550
 inside the game and well I hope that this 

00:07:03.239 --> 00:07:07.390
 already showed them the routes and the 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:09.490
 masters 

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:11.650
 and these reasons that I used to go to 

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:13.420
 top in renga what would I use those that 

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:15.970
 normality and in the case of going jungle 

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:18.820
 these are the ones in the jungle that have theft 

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:21.460
 of life and they go pretty well and of 

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.960
 masters then those of the tank to go to 

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:24.940
 butt normally in case it touched you a 

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.290
 up something that can stand dead not 

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.880
 hold pretty always normally 

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:29.950
 I put study a village of ebro like 

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.710
 I do not like being killed by two hosts 

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:34.000
 but instead for three to three 

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:35.590
 it's okay we can get it is by 

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.170
 example anti cup 5 you have to like to go 

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:40.750
 aggressive and if not then the jungle 

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:43.270
 we have this jungle behind also 

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:44.860
 would go quite well a clear of with the 

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.240
 of master's jungle with these routes 

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.200
 they go pretty well I think you'll have a 

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:50.900
 good level video theft 

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:52.810
 and well I hope you liked this 

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.270
 tutorial 

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:56.680
 if you want me to record some other tutorial 

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:58.360
 of the re champion can you see if I have it in 

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.680
 the channel or you can leave it in the 

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.300
 comments
