00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
play we were actually actually down 15

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.760 
play we were actually actually down 15
in<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.000> first<00:01:54.149> half<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.840> girls<00:01:55.500> really

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
in the first half and the girls really

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.289 
in the first half and the girls really
fought<00:01:56.070> back<00:01:56.310> we<00:01:56.549> pressed<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.060> we<00:01:57.180> were<00:01:57.240> able

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
fought back we pressed and we were able

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.609 
fought back we pressed and we were able
to<00:01:57.420> get<00:01:57.540> back<00:01:57.689> in<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.960> game<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.350> then<00:01:58.500> we

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
to get back in the game and then we

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.770 
to get back in the game and then we
ended<00:01:58.799> up<00:01:58.920> winning<00:01:59.159> by<00:01:59.790> I<00:01:59.820> think<00:02:00.119> almost<00:02:00.299> 20

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
ended up winning by I think almost 20

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.450 
ended up winning by I think almost 20
points<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.500> think<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.860> really<00:02:01.890> gave<00:02:02.280> us

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
points and I think that really gave us

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.660 
points and I think that really gave us
momentum<00:02:02.640> into<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.329> championship<00:02:03.869> play<00:02:04.670> so

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
momentum into the championship play so

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.059 
momentum into the championship play so
it's<00:02:06.360> we<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.200> girls<00:02:07.439> played<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.710> lot<00:02:07.950> of

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
it's we the girls played a lot of

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.230 
it's we the girls played a lot of
minutes<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.970> just<00:02:09.179> thought<00:02:09.360> at<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.780> end

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
minutes and I just thought at the end

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.870 
minutes and I just thought at the end
teams<00:02:10.540> were<00:02:10.720> very<00:02:10.960> tired<00:02:11.320> and<00:02:11.740> I<00:02:12.310> just<00:02:12.610> thought

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
teams were very tired and I just thought

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.640
