00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:04.090
 here 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.540
 what fart friends are like I hope 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.400
 are happening to him the most chingón 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.990
 I am ajax android today 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.580
 they see another in a battle with a team 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.619
 that had already brought this sensual channel 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.280
 so I hope it does not bother you and nothing 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.840
 more than saying 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.840
 we have start with the battle 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.100
 the battle today is against that 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.350
 goal so let's give it hard and tight 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.060
 the baby is taking out his turk 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.860
 which are usually physical defensive 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.140
 while I'm going to start taking out 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.370
 half sandro who is neither stratum nor 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.110
 it can make you many of thor 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.000
 I will honestly go for a trip and 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.860
 turn plain and simple to be 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.720
 even a little bit of damage what 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.370
 it's okay so now what I 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.199
 I'm predicting is the entry of 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.210
 red trap by this Turkish to the 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:48.920
 so I'm going to say get my latte 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.930
 take because with your skill you 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.610
 I can return , however, I am a speaker 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.620
 to decide to attack me directly 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.120
 with a flamethrower that with my kitten 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.340
 dominated then is not special defensive 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.530
 forgiveness is full attacking special not what 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.960
 They also hold as they should and apart 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.729
 get the burn cax so 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.259
 I'm in a good position because I do not 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.149
 I want to lose UFO friends in this 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:10.190
 point of the battle so I'm going to 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:12.200
 say withdraw from the battlefield I would 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.970
 I'm going to say I'm done with it since he is 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.979
 my special defensive in given the case of 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.899
 that would like to stay and go for another 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.430
 flamethrower the commandment I decided 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:21.259
 check out his tutor what he was going to say 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.450
 get your people to buy being an attack 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.369
 psychic type but this will put me in a 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.510
 very good position if it were not for a 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.510
 little detail that I 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.630
 has basically nothing concrete that 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.340
 I give them more than toxic ones and that's 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.260
 when giving is very ineffective so who 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.240
 you can say change and stick your skewer 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.040
 It was because of a desire to change what I 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.900
 I would like and that will recover all the 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.729
 life in case it attacks me then 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.950
 males that by giving very confident in me 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.840
 I give it a critical blow myself. 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.210
 with the truth robustness but the 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.250
 wales surprises told me is the blow 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.140
 critic was out of the place so he fears 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.780
 you go back to the bank in that was going to come 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.030
 to the battlefield brontosaurus mass not 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.340
 I know if my opponent is a master of ajax 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.780
 or of the prediction but by earthquake 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.060
 which is super effective another table 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.520
 brontosaurus and it almost weakens me from a 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.830
 only blow luckily will want injuries 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.970
 and like nes and have too much hp to 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.280
 recover all his life of mass 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.870
 brontosaurus here is a play by a 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.580
 bit a bit weird since I'm going to decide 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.470
 change brontosaurus friendship and poke 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.900
 my dragon ball I do not really know why 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.360
 is that any blow that this 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.070
 Stalin thing and it's going to end up weakening 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.140
 so they go for some rock traps 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.820
 I say friend this is a game that we can 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.100
 play both and return to my own 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.720
 trap rocks the steam a sharp rock 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.680
 with which despite my drone bolt 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.540
 it's defensive physical 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.430
 but also as it should in addition to a 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.290
 critical blow and now I'm going for my 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.329
 first round after toxic was a 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.489
 very bad decision to go for the pure 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:46.260
 toxic since my opponent has a 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.879
 stained glass on the computer and when the 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.620
 battlefield this glass is going to remove 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:51.420
 the toxic barbs 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.310
 I'm going to fly by the quills because if I'm better 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.019
 de gràcia with the one who brings April and good 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.819
 can come back from the barbed round he's going 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.859
 for a tuned rock that luckily sees me 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.150
 dragon ball is going to avoid it I think 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:02.579
 it would have been better play than my 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.379
 opponent or by an earthquake as 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.549
 with the range of life that I have I am 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:07.349
 sure an earthquake would have 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.269
 finished with me to go for another rock 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:10.980
 sharp that luckily send it can 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.079
 failure is compensated for the fact that 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.299
 shows self friend of downing so 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.790
 I'm going to put my three barbed lines one 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:20.219
 line of toxic barbs and aside I'll 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.409
 put the traps rocks but what is the 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:24.659
 Saturday seed its sharp rock and my 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:26.549
 dragon ball to fall weakened by 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:29.189
 I'm going to say get simple sand 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.689
 and plainly to top stieglitz it 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:33.030
 it is causing quite a lot of problems 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:35.159
 I had already lived this too much and 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.169
 now to end it I will go question 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:38.760
 remote since with anything up 

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:40.080
 simply weaken the question that 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.420
 they blow him to transit 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.150
 of rock that has and will fall weakened 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.970
 so I pulled you and control the team 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.500
 once and after a glass just 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.510
 to remove the posts girls of the field 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.790
 of battle is going to hurt with the 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.770
 traps rocks and apart he is made of 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.600
 work almost half of life with 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.160
 Well, what milk is this glass? 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.320
 inside the battlefield and it's already got off 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.820
 half of life now I'm going to decide 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.530
 will evolve a mega glass which 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.120
 It was to be expected since nobody used 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.860
 stained glass and normal in the mere 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.200
 evolution I have not seen anyone who 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.210
 used like this and how the protection was 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.400
 too obvious what I'm going to decide 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.980
 to do is importance dragon I will put 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.600
 to go down, sand dance under the sand and 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.959
 well I was already here confident because my 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.310
 my thing limits is nature jolie by 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.320
 so I thought that in the next turn 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.720
 could be faster than this mega virile 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.220
 so I'm going to decide what to give but 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.140
 this mega vidrialés hard also in the 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.000
 nature jolie do much faster 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.740
 that enables me and lavalle of lists of 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.810
 I use the scissors x it was a sacrifice 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.550
 necessary was a very bad play of my 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.220
 part but good mistakes we make 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.710
 all now I'm going to say put in half 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.850
 that sandro as elected Spanish so 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.920
 I'm going to do a lot faster than this 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.660
 mega virile so this mega 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.580
 protection just to see what it was 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.350
 what I was going to do because if it does not fail me 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.240
 the memory he has an elective in his 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.610
 team so the double edge is going to 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.260
 paste neutral to all pokémon what 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.030
 bad of not being movements like bird 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.370
 roasted or double edged since I star 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.900
 actor is dying little by little and for 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.430
 luck I will be much faster than 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.200
 this mega glass thanks to the chaise 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.040
 card and this mega biden and the cowboy 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.150
 enabled 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.680
 so a nuisance less for the 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.510
 team does not really make much sense 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.070
 that my opponent will try to save the 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.930
 checks and I changed it and it came back to 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.060
 put on the battlefield was going to die 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.620
 for the few sketches so he goes 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.540
 say put his daughter and dragon that what 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.760
 could better have fire 6 here has 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.230
 I'm quite surprised because I'm not going to 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.850
 say faster than cricket this 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.950
 caliber was going to be much faster than 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.660
 I complain and dragon usually brings it to 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:33.060
 the first one also chosen so this 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.860
 dragon is a less worry for me 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.230
 unfortunately I'm still pretty hurt 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.970
 with the recoil damage and a serious 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.980
 He decides to get his tutor what and here is 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.900
 when I thank myself I appreciate it 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.760
 wholeheartedly have put the houses 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.770
 on the battlefield you want to get down 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.730
 more than half of your current injuries and 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.580
 I'll leave it in sufficient range 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:52.050
 so that the double edge ends with him like that 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.860
 that this is getting beautiful and 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.250
 unknown to me 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:58.139
 alecsandro is being pure sweep now 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.000
 my opponent to decide to take out his star 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:02.219
 me at this point of the battle and just 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.780
 I have two pokemon left to my opponent 

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:05.370
 the bad thing is that he probably dies 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.270
 for the year of retreat for the double 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.590
 edge 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.300
 once again I will go back to being more 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.469
 quick to scare me and in favor of a 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.139
 double edge that will end 

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:16.879
 sliding being me and one would say here 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:16.879
 I will be because it has weakened but 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.710
 It was one of those days when Daddy and 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:28.140
 his got up good and said today 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:30.210
 will be by step living with Christmas and 

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.470
 applied you do so at its maximum 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.990
 expression this is what he has done in his 

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:36.060
 Pure friends state is when a pokémon 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.800
 Survive with one over life does not matter 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.050
 if you give a true critic the year of 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.240
 recoil over with a life that's that 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:44.340
 it's that way the purest is skype virgin 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.170
 by God I can tell you and good
