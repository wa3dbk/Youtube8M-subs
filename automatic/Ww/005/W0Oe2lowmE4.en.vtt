00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
by my husband I kind of showed him what

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.580 
by my husband I kind of showed him what
I<00:01:41.220> was<00:01:41.430> looking<00:01:41.850> for<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.360> then<00:01:42.600> we<00:01:42.810> built<00:01:43.350> it

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
I was looking for and then we built it

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.160 
I was looking for and then we built it
together<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:44.759> we<00:01:45.000> just<00:01:45.180> need<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.600> make<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.990> new

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
together so we just need to make a new

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.590 
together so we just need to make a new
base<00:01:46.409> for<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.100> then<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.340> want<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.640> have<00:01:47.850> some

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
base for it and then I want to have some

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.499 
base for it and then I want to have some
things<00:01:48.840> hang<00:01:49.320> down<00:01:49.619> off<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.280> top<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:51.329> the

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
things hang down off the top so the

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.880 
things hang down off the top so the
first<00:01:51.810> thing<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.409> got

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:01.039 

is<00:01:55.890> this<00:01:56.520> really<00:01:57.330> cool<00:01:59.299> activity<00:02:00.299> center<00:02:00.780> and

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
is this really cool activity center and

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.100 
is this really cool activity center and
I<00:02:01.470> think<00:02:01.740> beaker<00:02:02.220> is<00:02:02.490> going<00:02:02.970> to<00:02:03.240> love<00:02:03.509> this<00:02:03.540> so

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
I think beaker is going to love this so

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.630 
I think beaker is going to love this so
what<00:02:04.320> we're<00:02:04.470> gonna<00:02:04.560> do<00:02:04.890> is<00:02:05.070> we're<00:02:05.220> gonna<00:02:05.280> hang

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
what we're gonna do is we're gonna hang

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.460 
what we're gonna do is we're gonna hang
some<00:02:05.850> hooks<00:02:06.119> or<00:02:06.390> something<00:02:06.720> from<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.080> ceiling

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
some hooks or something from the ceiling

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.740 
some hooks or something from the ceiling
or<00:02:07.650> maybe<00:02:08.459> I<00:02:08.580> could<00:02:08.819> just<00:02:08.940> even<00:02:09.270> hang<00:02:09.450> this<00:02:09.569> off

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
or maybe I could just even hang this off

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.620 
or maybe I could just even hang this off
the<00:02:09.959> wall<00:02:10.110> I'm<00:02:10.350> not<00:02:10.590> 100%<00:02:11.039> sure<00:02:11.489> how<00:02:12.330> I'm<00:02:12.480> gonna

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
have been known to bite and then just

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.420 
have been known to bite and then just
that<00:02:54.660> and<00:02:54.930> then<00:02:55.019> they<00:02:55.140> can't<00:02:55.380> digest<00:02:55.650> it<00:02:56.130> and

playing with it and pulling at it and so
I<00:05:25.530> just<00:05:25.680> wanted<00:05:25.950> him<00:05:26.130> to<00:05:26.220> have<00:05:26.400> a<00:05:26.460> few<00:05:26.729> more

toys that he could kind of for it with

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.890 
toys that he could kind of for it with
so<00:05:29.700> this<00:05:30.030> last<00:05:30.300> one<00:05:30.539> here<00:05:30.990> is<00:05:31.050> a<00:05:32.060> JW<00:05:33.060> act<00:05:33.450> to<00:05:33.750> the

so this last one here is a JW act to the

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.310 
so this last one here is a JW act to the
toys<00:05:34.200> traffic<00:05:35.099> light<00:05:35.310> and<00:05:36.180> it<00:05:36.900> was<00:05:37.020> part<00:05:37.289> of

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
toys traffic light and it was part of

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.170 
toys traffic light and it was part of
their<00:05:37.440> add-on<00:05:37.860> program<00:05:38.310> that's<00:05:38.580> why<00:05:38.760> I<00:05:38.789> bought

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
their add-on program that's why I bought

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.810 
their add-on program that's why I bought
this<00:05:39.390> one<00:05:39.659> I<00:05:40.530> just<00:05:40.770> thought<00:05:41.070> it<00:05:41.340> would<00:05:41.430> be<00:05:41.580> kind

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
this one I just thought it would be kind

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.409 
this one I just thought it would be kind
of<00:05:41.909> fun<00:05:42.210> and<00:05:42.599> it's<00:05:43.050> broken<00:05:43.610> it<00:05:44.610> has<00:05:45.030> this

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:45.419 
of fun and it's broken it has this

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:48.080 
of fun and it's broken it has this
yellow<00:05:45.870> ball<00:05:46.200> and<00:05:46.680> this<00:05:47.250> red<00:05:47.520> ball<00:05:47.729> and

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
yellow ball and this red ball and

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.750 
yellow ball and this red ball and
there's

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:48.760 
there's

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.090 
there's
to<00:05:48.850> be<00:05:48.970> in<00:05:49.120> here<00:05:49.480> that's<00:05:50.290> probably<00:05:50.680> why<00:05:50.860> it<00:05:51.040> was

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.100 
to be in here that's probably why it was

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.870 
to be in here that's probably why it was
such<00:05:51.310> a<00:05:51.370> cheap<00:05:51.820> toy<00:05:52.680> because<00:05:53.680> it's<00:05:54.520> this

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
such a cheap toy because it's this

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.510 
such a cheap toy because it's this
broken<00:05:55.540> that's<00:05:55.780> disappointing<00:05:56.350> so<00:05:57.160> I<00:05:57.190> have<00:05:57.370> to

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 
broken that's disappointing so I have to

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.360 
broken that's disappointing so I have to
see<00:05:57.730> if<00:05:57.820> there's<00:05:58.060> something<00:05:58.390> I<00:05:58.630> can<00:05:59.370> MacGyver

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
see if there's something I can MacGyver

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.430 
see if there's something I can MacGyver
for<00:06:01.180> him<00:06:01.590> so<00:06:02.590> I<00:06:02.650> can<00:06:02.890> still<00:06:03.190> use<00:06:03.370> it<00:06:04.440> that's

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
for him so I can still use it that's

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:12.930 
for him so I can still use it that's
really<00:06:05.740> crummy<00:06:10.950> so<00:06:11.950> anyways<00:06:12.310> those<00:06:12.640> are<00:06:12.820> all

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
really crummy so anyways those are all

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.700 
really crummy so anyways those are all
the<00:06:13.090> items<00:06:13.120> that<00:06:13.510> I<00:06:13.660> picked<00:06:13.930> up<00:06:14.050> for<00:06:14.320> a<00:06:14.350> beaker

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:14.710 
the items that I picked up for a beaker

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.590 
the items that I picked up for a beaker
I<00:06:14.950> think<00:06:15.190> it's<00:06:15.400> for<00:06:15.580> looking<00:06:15.790> like<00:06:16.060> everything

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:16.600 
I think it's for looking like everything

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.110 
I think it's for looking like everything
and<00:06:16.870> hopefully<00:06:17.290> I<00:06:17.350> can<00:06:17.500> convince<00:06:18.310> my<00:06:18.610> husband

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 
and hopefully I can convince my husband

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.080 
and hopefully I can convince my husband
to<00:06:19.500> alter<00:06:20.500> the<00:06:20.650> play<00:06:20.860> Jim<00:06:21.100> and<00:06:21.400> then<00:06:21.700> we<00:06:21.850> can

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090 
to alter the play Jim and then we can

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.790 
to alter the play Jim and then we can
get<00:06:22.240> that<00:06:22.480> little<00:06:22.720> corner<00:06:22.990> set<00:06:23.320> up<00:06:23.410> for<00:06:23.650> him

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 
get that little corner set up for him

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.070
