00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
it through it's going to create like a

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.050 
it through it's going to create like a
soft<00:01:50.280> wave<00:01:50.520> like<00:01:50.759> this<00:01:50.820> if<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:51.840> want<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.200> um<00:01:52.380> a

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
soft wave like this if you want it um a

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.440 
soft wave like this if you want it um a
little<00:01:54.060> more<00:01:54.450> curly<00:01:55.110> more<00:01:55.380> spiral<00:01:55.950> then<00:01:56.670> you

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
little more curly more spiral then you

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.080 
little more curly more spiral then you
know<00:01:57.540> take<00:01:58.020> your<00:01:58.200> time<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.549> pull<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.759> little

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
know take your time and pull a little

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.410 
know take your time and pull a little
bit<00:02:00.240> slower<00:02:01.310> maybe<00:02:02.310> angle<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.880> little<00:02:03.000> bit<00:02:03.270> more

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
bit slower maybe angle a little bit more

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.410 
bit slower maybe angle a little bit more
it'll<00:02:06.420> make<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.780> curl<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.290> little<00:02:07.320> more<00:02:07.829> a

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
it'll make the curl a little more a

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.479 
it'll make the curl a little more a
bouncy<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.660> little<00:02:10.560> more<00:02:10.649> spiral<00:02:11.069> so<00:02:11.250> that's

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
bouncy a little more spiral so that's

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.220 
bouncy a little more spiral so that's
that's<00:02:11.940> what

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
that's what

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.380 
that's what
can<00:02:12.409> do<00:02:12.590> so<00:02:13.310> I'm<00:02:13.430> basically<00:02:13.760> going<00:02:14.209> to<00:02:14.269> be

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
can do so I'm basically going to be

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.080 
can do so I'm basically going to be
doing<00:02:14.540> this<00:02:14.810> throughout<00:02:15.400> all<00:02:16.400> of<00:02:16.459> my<00:02:16.790> hair

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090

doing this throughout all of my hair
going<00:02:17.510> in<00:02:17.810> sections<00:02:18.170> so<00:02:18.290> I'm<00:02:18.349> starting<00:02:18.709> with

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
going in sections so I'm starting with

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.470 
going in sections so I'm starting with
the<00:02:18.920> lower<00:02:19.099> ends<00:02:19.549> and<00:02:19.700> then<00:02:20.180> i'm<00:02:20.299> going<00:02:20.420> to

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
the lower ends and then i'm going to

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.750 
the lower ends and then i'm going to
move<00:02:20.629> upward<00:02:21.280> so<00:02:22.280> I'm<00:02:22.370> going<00:02:22.489> to<00:02:22.549> curl<00:02:22.640> the

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
move upward so I'm going to curl the

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.759 
move upward so I'm going to curl the
rest<00:02:23.000> of<00:02:23.150> my<00:02:23.209> head<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:23.720> I<00:02:23.930> will<00:02:24.110> be<00:02:24.260> right<00:02:24.739> back

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
rest of my head and I will be right back

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.860 
rest of my head and I will be right back
okay<00:02:25.280> so<00:02:25.340> now<00:02:25.640> that<00:02:25.670> I<00:02:25.819> have<00:02:25.849> all<00:02:26.180> of<00:02:26.239> my<00:02:26.450> hair

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.770 
okay so now that I have all of my hair
curled<00:02:27.200> I<00:02:27.440> want<00:02:28.430> to<00:02:28.640> let<00:02:28.879> the<00:02:29.269> curls

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
curled I want to let the curls

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.440 
curled I want to let the curls
completely<00:02:30.379> cool<00:02:30.680> down<00:02:30.709> because<00:02:31.370> it'll<00:02:32.180> allow

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
completely cool down because it'll allow

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.740 
completely cool down because it'll allow
the<00:02:33.400> curls<00:02:34.400> to<00:02:34.640> kind<00:02:34.970> of<00:02:35.030> set<00:02:35.360> and<00:02:35.599> they'll

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
the curls to kind of set and they'll

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.809 
the curls to kind of set and they'll
stay<00:02:35.989> a<00:02:36.019> little<00:02:36.290> bit<00:02:36.410> longer<00:02:36.739> now<00:02:37.519> it's<00:02:37.670> going

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
stay a little bit longer now it's going

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.569 
stay a little bit longer now it's going
to<00:02:37.910> be<00:02:38.000> different<00:02:38.239> if<00:02:38.569> you<00:02:39.079> have<00:02:39.579> naturally

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
it's somewhat fine so it doesn't take a

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.949 
it's somewhat fine so it doesn't take a

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.360 

okay<00:03:40.120> this<00:03:40.390> looks<00:03:40.540> like<00:03:40.750> mess<00:03:40.990> but<00:03:41.500> this

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
okay this looks like mess but this

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.110 
okay this looks like mess but this
there's<00:03:42.880> a<00:03:43.000> little<00:03:43.510> bit<00:03:43.780> of<00:03:44.820> method<00:03:45.820> to<00:03:45.970> my

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
there's a little bit of method to my

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.420 
there's a little bit of method to my
madness<00:03:46.150> so<00:03:47.080> now<00:03:47.230> that<00:03:47.260> I<00:03:47.500> have<00:03:47.530> all<00:03:47.740> of<00:03:48.070> the

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
madness so now that I have all of the

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.700 
madness so now that I have all of the
volume<00:03:48.910> that<00:03:49.060> I<00:03:49.120> want<00:03:49.360> at<00:03:49.420> the<00:03:49.510> top<00:03:49.750> I'm<00:03:50.170> going

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:50.710 
volume that I want at the top I'm going

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:56.130 
volume that I want at the top I'm going
to<00:03:50.980> try<00:03:51.310> to<00:03:51.660> smooth<00:03:52.660> out<00:03:53.020> a<00:03:54.480> little<00:03:55.480> bit<00:03:55.750> just

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
to try to smooth out a little bit just

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.600 
to try to smooth out a little bit just
so<00:03:56.260> that<00:03:57.990> doesn't<00:03:58.990> look<00:03:59.080> like<00:03:59.140> a<00:03:59.350> giant<00:04:00.070> rats

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
so that doesn't look like a giant rats

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.190 
so that doesn't look like a giant rats
nest<00:04:00.970> but<00:04:01.180> it<00:04:01.300> is<00:04:01.390> going<00:04:01.570> to<00:04:01.660> give<00:04:01.810> me<00:04:01.840> a

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
nest but it is going to give me a

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.360 
nest but it is going to give me a
sufficient<00:04:02.920> amount<00:04:02.980> of<00:04:03.280> body<00:04:04.120> at<00:04:04.540> the<00:04:05.370> crown

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370
