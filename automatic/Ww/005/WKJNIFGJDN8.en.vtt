 windows you know how this 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.840
 here in the video and today the very easy thing 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:39.090
 to make people do not know but I will 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:42.809
 teach you touch settings from the 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.620
 computer will open this here because only 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:50.460
 perform the recovery update on 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:01:03.409
 recovery and restart now standby 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:01:06.470
 restart a little the problem will do 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:09.860
 the problems 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:14.100
 there you come from options released 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:19.310
 option settings 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.310
 here to enable positions 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:31.200
 restarted wait a little, it goes 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.930
 restart but it will start right in this 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.119
 Okay, this is a way there you will have 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.310
 what to do 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:44.720
 take a little of what I'm going to do 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.720
 many process too long and tiring 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.360
 Thank you, still call to complain. 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.560
 of the day is better than I know to reap 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.260
 Inside is ok, come on, what do you have? 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.970
 what to do here here and disable 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.730
 native drive positions beyond search 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.010
 that the 7 disable the position 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.229
 this number 7 will come here on the keyboard of 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.450
 rock will tighten the set also in Quito 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.320
 here will face the seven you 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:20.690
 asked 7 and already start alone ok 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:22.910
 then it starts to fill again is good 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.100
 expect windows to start normally from 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.870
 new will not work try something 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.000
 a very quick thing takes very good 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.490
 then start making the changes 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.290
 necessary experience and windows 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.510
 usually the way you know 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.480
 and then the installation of this must be 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.000
 available I have already played only if 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.620
 little will be available left 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.620
 influence guides people too 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:19.230
 nice work touch her reports started 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.140
 What are you going to do after that, may I come? 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.650
 here you in flash mtur folder already 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.920
 to reinstall the drivers for the 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.170
 text will work normal again what 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.990
 expect that with starting medense year 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:37.860
 still have some problems can see 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:39.870
 this in version 8 of windows is the 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.760
 windows version 10 doc but I put 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.370
 to make you look good like you do not 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.440
 They have a hard time doing what I came for 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:53.660
 here o 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:58.400
 flash dredger flash drives 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:01.920
 can wait to abrinq the next 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.780
 to install again I'll be there 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.270
 spy what you see that such 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:10.740
 saying the same thing show us 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:13.560
 xperia drivers from the southern stretches and 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:16.709
 flash at the last touch with which the problem 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:22.650
 who watched it on that star's note ps 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:27.660
 is the only xperia should be that the flash mode 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:32.940
 and flash seek it look on the market and the 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:36.500
 windows version touch my 8 3 to r 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.500
 128 install here 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:48.780
 extracting is that I 'm going to try to move here 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.200
 will do just because it is already 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:54.450
 installed ok but the others should serve 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.430
 it is working because these two 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:59.160
 stranger because I already had the 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.440
 flash mutti closes the last flash 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.570
 bolt is already there understood that because the 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:07.290
 idea of the application but other drives 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:09.540
 xperia EU google that was installed 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.650
 usually so it is not then either 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.610
 say that the process worked 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:16.140
 normally 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:18.240
 then the video today is pretty basic was only 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.280
 this only you have to use as install the 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.440
 windows 8 then it means that the text 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.190
 also works on windows 8 that i 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:41.460
 here o 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:43.770
 I'll search here to open the text that opens 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:47.340
 on here 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:50.099
 Wait to see that April is already here. 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.930
 working here 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:54.030
 the question they should choose what they want 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.099
 Say David is working well. 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.979
 best negative chance of stable 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:02.280
 to show what you have in facebook template 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:04.860
 It is also possible to show in the 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:09.539
 this for you and it in fast boot 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:11.490
 mount but the video is basically that I 

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:13.289
 I ask why you share this 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.330
 video which helps me a lot to 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:17.250
 and this is it 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.490
 staying here, thanks, and even 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.490
 next
