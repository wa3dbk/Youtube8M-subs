00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
like this I'll fold that into one more

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.370 
like this I'll fold that into one more
time<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:27.210> next<00:01:27.450> thing<00:01:27.570> we<00:01:27.689> do<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:28.020> I'm<00:01:28.200> going

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
to just roll this I'll fold this down

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.959 
to just roll this I'll fold this down
also<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.530> I'll<00:01:34.530> roll<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:34.979> into<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.700> circular

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:37.969

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:58.690 
rolling bending the edges and I get to
here<00:01:50.789> I<00:01:52.069> fold<00:01:53.069> it<00:01:53.219> down<00:01:53.399> once

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.239

cover up the white piece of paper so
it's<00:02:05.549> pretty<00:02:05.759> simple<00:02:06.770> so<00:02:07.770> now<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:07.950> begin

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
it's pretty simple so now you begin

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.660 
it's pretty simple so now you begin
rolling<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.479> continue<00:02:10.049> to<00:02:10.259> roll<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.879> see<00:02:13.670> and

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
as you get to a certain spot you'll have

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.710 
as you get to a certain spot you'll have
to<00:02:16.709> fold<00:02:16.920> it<00:02:17.040> again<00:02:17.340> all<00:02:17.970> I'm<00:02:18.150> doing<00:02:18.569> is

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
to fold it again all I'm doing is

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.690 
to fold it again all I'm doing is
covering<00:02:19.200> up<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.650> white<00:02:19.830> piece<00:02:20.010> of<00:02:20.040> paper<00:02:20.220> by

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
covering up the white piece of paper by

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.509 
covering up the white piece of paper by
folding<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.360> straight<00:02:21.870> path<00:02:22.230> download<00:02:23.840> so<00:02:25.519> and

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
folding a straight path download so and

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:33.530 
folding a straight path download so and
I<00:02:26.700> continue<00:02:27.239> to<00:02:27.269> roll<00:02:27.780> it<00:02:27.989> and<00:02:30.319> then<00:02:32.510> again<00:02:33.510> I

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
I continue to roll it and then again I

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.559 
I continue to roll it and then again I
would<00:02:33.870> have<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:34.019> fold<00:02:34.410> it<00:02:34.940> cover<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.209> piece<00:02:36.420> in

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
would have to fold it cover the piece in

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:42.710 
would have to fold it cover the piece in
the<00:02:36.660> back<00:02:37.160> so<00:02:40.700> make<00:02:41.700> sure<00:02:41.730> you<00:02:41.970> hold<00:02:42.150> onto<00:02:42.390> this

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
the back so make sure you hold onto this

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.390 
the back so make sure you hold onto this
tiny<00:02:43.349> little<00:02:43.650> stub<00:02:44.099> so<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.090> doesn't<00:02:45.360> go<00:02:45.480> free

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
tiny little stub so it doesn't go free

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.349 
tiny little stub so it doesn't go free
and<00:02:47.400> again<00:02:47.879> you<00:02:48.180> fold<00:02:48.450> it<00:02:48.720> always<00:02:49.560> hiding<00:02:49.829> the

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
and again you fold it always hiding the

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:54.860 
and again you fold it always hiding the
white<00:02:51.359> part<00:02:53.120> don't<00:02:54.120> worry<00:02:54.450> about<00:02:54.540> how<00:02:54.750> it

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
white part don't worry about how it

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.660 
white part don't worry about how it
looks<00:02:54.930> right<00:02:55.230> now<00:02:55.440> and<00:02:55.799> now<00:02:55.950> you<00:02:56.010> fold<00:02:56.370> it<00:02:56.489> back

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
looks right now and now you fold it back

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:03.699 
looks right now and now you fold it back
word<00:02:56.910> of<00:02:57.000> course<00:02:57.739> hiding<00:02:58.739> the<00:02:58.920> white<00:02:59.160> piece

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:13.640 

once<00:03:04.709> again<00:03:06.590> folding<00:03:07.590> it<00:03:11.870> hold<00:03:12.870> onto<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.319> stub

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
once again folding it hold onto the stub

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.479 
once again folding it hold onto the stub
do<00:03:14.370> not<00:03:14.669> loose<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.359> stub<00:03:15.889> the<00:03:16.889> stubs<00:03:17.220> like

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
do not loose the stub the stubs like

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.789 
do not loose the stub the stubs like
your<00:03:17.639> focus<00:03:18.000> point<00:03:18.139> you<00:03:19.139> can<00:03:19.290> actually<00:03:19.440> just

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
your focus point you can actually just

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.990 
your focus point you can actually just
hold<00:03:20.639> onto<00:03:20.849> the<00:03:21.120> stub<00:03:21.389> so<00:03:22.230> and<00:03:22.849> continue<00:03:23.849> to

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
hold onto the stub so and continue to

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.849 
hold onto the stub so and continue to
fold<00:03:24.269> make<00:03:24.630> sure<00:03:24.780> that<00:03:24.930> stub<00:03:25.200> is<00:03:25.349> always<00:03:25.709> in

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
fold make sure that stub is always in

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:33.130 
fold make sure that stub is always in
the<00:03:25.950> middle<00:03:29.120> see

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:40.740 

course<00:03:35.500> fold<00:03:36.500> again

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.110 

don't<00:03:41.750> lose<00:03:41.990> your<00:03:42.170> stun<00:03:43.210> and<00:03:44.210> you<00:03:44.330> fold<00:03:44.540> it<00:03:44.660> in

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
don't lose your stun and you fold it in

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.630 
don't lose your stun and you fold it in
once<00:03:47.120> again<00:03:49.600> right<00:03:50.600> over<00:03:50.930> here<00:03:51.260> you<00:03:52.250> fold<00:03:52.550> it

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
once again right over here you fold it

00:03:52.640 --> 00:04:02.590 
once again right over here you fold it
inward<00:03:53.150> once<00:03:54.670> again<00:03:55.670> a<00:03:55.970> straight<00:03:56.690> shot<00:04:01.090> so<00:04:02.090> I

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
inward once again a straight shot so I

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.340 
inward once again a straight shot so I
just<00:04:03.140> start<00:04:03.350> to<00:04:03.440> look<00:04:03.590> like<00:04:03.800> this<00:04:04.010> order<00:04:05.350> and

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
just start to look like this order and

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.890 
just start to look like this order and
it's<00:04:07.190> pretty<00:04:07.370> simple<00:04:07.730> you<00:04:07.880> want<00:04:08.060> to<00:04:08.209> make<00:04:08.810> it

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
it's pretty simple you want to make it

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.690 
it's pretty simple you want to make it
tighter<00:04:09.050> just<00:04:09.380> hold<00:04:09.830> the<00:04:09.950> middle<00:04:10.100> part<00:04:10.430> and

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
tighter just hold the middle part and

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.680 
tighter just hold the middle part and
just<00:04:10.970> twist<00:04:11.180> it<00:04:11.360> in<00:04:12.670> rows<00:04:13.670> like<00:04:13.850> it<00:04:14.030> looks<00:04:14.180> now

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.670 

but<00:04:17.690> you<00:04:17.750> can<00:04:17.870> do<00:04:17.930> that<00:04:18.049> at<00:04:18.200> the<00:04:18.290> end<00:04:18.470> of<00:04:18.590> you

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
but you can do that at the end of you

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.199 
but you can do that at the end of you

yeah continue to soar like a square like
mo<00:04:30.500> movement<00:04:33.820> and<00:04:34.930> it's<00:04:35.930> actually<00:04:36.680> quite<00:04:36.919> hard

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
mo movement and it's actually quite hard

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.190 
mo movement and it's actually quite hard
to<00:04:37.370> record<00:04:37.970> and<00:04:38.180> do<00:04:38.270> this<00:04:38.419> in<00:04:38.630> the<00:04:38.720> same<00:04:38.930> time

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
to record and do this in the same time

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.590 
to record and do this in the same time
trying<00:04:39.979> to<00:04:40.130> make<00:04:40.250> it<00:04:40.370> focus<00:04:40.760> and<00:04:40.940> whatnot<00:04:41.270> see
