 to say that it poses a greed we go 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:27.740

 starvation the sugars or that knows it on 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:46.579

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.650
 there is a little more milk and a little 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.760
 Just under nine votes there but we went 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:07.000
 one kneads slowly during four five 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.000
 minutes 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:13.130
 tac look that makes it really a 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.910
 texture a little pinch not at all laugh at 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.580
 cat there we will add the beurs by the 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.490
 gore the exit of the roundabout references 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:29.840
 and ointments and then last little 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:33.410
 character here is stayed very much said 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.649
 so claude lavoie really looks 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:39.380
 super sticky a little bit of agreement on 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:42.050
 will release it from the hook 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.429
 hung up you do one year bull right here and 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.679
 after I'm going to put it in the salad bowl 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:46.820
 or toxic and let it grow 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:49.280
 doubled in volume 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.380
 for an hour and a half hour 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.950
 in the corner the warmest show of 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.690
 your kitchen 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.130
 its double volume you take it 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.440
 perfume is the principle of all 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.640
 pasta a little brioche ok let's go 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.500
 let the baker's yeast 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.479
 express yourself now 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.270
 patience patience for the batala you go 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:11.450
 well push widely in the volume 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:13.819
 perfect thumb emulators all 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.440
 checked flap nickel to chase 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.120
 the air then say it really smells very 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.989
 very good there I love this season two 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:26.380
 months here and there you want to drop it 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:26.380
 on the board so go go 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:32.879
 and there we will divide it one according to the 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.859
 overuse afterwards to make 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:39.329
 work a thousand better train them 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:49.200
 ok you pieces little bits by bit 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:51.150
 near 40 g after then there pieces and 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.439
 have the balls that's it for the 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.180
 balls and you want flap is like that 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:57.719
 here inside for the milk bread 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.450
 we can keep them like that comes to 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:02.909
 waltzes and according to the court there now 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.680
 this is his everything is moreover 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:06.540
 often the base is the ball of agreement 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.560
 and from there we're going to put it 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.569
 a little bit by shuttle 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:18.810
 you flatten the palm of your hand are you 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:21.239
 will take half half and I the 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:25.200
 clip have had after I take it 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:30.450
 the other party you pass and I pinch 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.859
 hockey and I see ego our little ones 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.079
 milk pudding with suitcases and are ready 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:36.599
 we're going to put a little film just sitting 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.250
 on top like that it's to keep 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.659
 the moisture we will let them grow 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.519
 in the warmest corner of the kitchen 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:43.049
 next to a sheath of the radiators and 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.669
 then you have to wait thirty 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.349
 forty fifty minutes it will depend 

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:47.970
 cooking temperature ok what is 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.669
 important is that it doubles in volume 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.859
 80th doha you'll see our words and 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:54.870
 you do they really have my sense that 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.349
 novel had doubled in volume without 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.229
 problem 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:00.000
 ok we will gild them we seek roman des 

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:03.409
 baths and prepare for new mixture 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.060
 of of bad plays like an omelet 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:09.509
 we go well on the sides we do not put 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.400
 too much it does not have to flow like that 

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:13.409
 stay nice even if the lobby is a small 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.320
 little brioche we will make the famous gesture 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:18.299
 from baker to evening game with a razor 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.130
 or with a chisel and that's it 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.470
 will allow steam 2 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.270
 to escape during cooking and 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.070
 to blow a little more the bench then 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.670
 in dida and more his little friends 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:35.040
 I find then I do like those 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:37.320
 of the group and m there we all finished 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.040
 to preheat your oven to 180 degrees and 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.210
 one goes with leather between 12 and 15 min 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.640
 so it's not milk they are 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.010
 really well cooked you see this 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.720
 what is it like bread it sounds 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.290
 when you do that at last we can 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.360
 to say that it's cooked 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.980
 it sounds it sounds hollow a little bit 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.690
 that is, it is cooked 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.190
 wait for it to cool well in 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.720
 wines tasted I hope we have you 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.510
