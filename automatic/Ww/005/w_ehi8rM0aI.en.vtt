00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
Laredo with the 401 had this Jeep about

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.690 
Laredo with the 401 had this Jeep about
three<00:00:09.330> years<00:00:09.450> now

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:10.700 
three years now

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.680 
three years now
haven't<00:00:11.700> really<00:00:11.790> driven<00:00:12.120> it<00:00:12.210> much<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.540> past

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
haven't really driven it much the past

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.799 
haven't really driven it much the past
year<00:00:13.080> because<00:00:13.200> it's<00:00:13.500> needed<00:00:14.360> some<00:00:15.360> work<00:00:15.540> done

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
year because it's needed some work done

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.410 
year because it's needed some work done
on<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:16.199> ignition<00:00:16.590> system<00:00:17.180> so<00:00:18.180> it's<00:00:18.270> just

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
on the ignition system so it's just

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.109 
on the ignition system so it's just
pretty<00:00:18.660> much<00:00:18.900> been<00:00:19.080> sitting<00:00:19.380> around<00:00:19.970> if<00:00:20.970> you

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
pretty much been sitting around if you

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.640 
pretty much been sitting around if you
filled<00:00:21.390> with<00:00:21.660> it<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:21.900> could<00:00:22.020> get<00:00:22.199> it<00:00:22.320> running

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
filled with it you could get it running

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.040 
filled with it you could get it running
but<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.369> was<00:00:23.490> just<00:00:23.580> kind<00:00:23.850> of<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.970> general<00:00:24.689> pain

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
but it was just kind of a general pain

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.390 
but it was just kind of a general pain
in<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.260> ass<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.680> sometimes<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.130> would<00:00:26.189> lose

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
in the ass and sometimes it would lose

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.990 
in the ass and sometimes it would lose
spark<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:27.289> anyway<00:00:28.289> finally<00:00:29.130> done<00:00:29.699> some<00:00:29.880> work

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
spark so anyway finally done some work

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.240 
spark so anyway finally done some work
to<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.619> seem<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.740> have<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.949> ignition

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
to it and seem to have the ignition

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:40.130 
to it and seem to have the ignition
system<00:00:32.430> in<00:00:33.800> in<00:00:34.800> order<00:00:35.070> again<00:00:36.500> basically<00:00:39.110> put<00:00:40.110> a

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
system in in order again basically put a

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.540 
system in in order again basically put a
new<00:00:40.320> distributor<00:00:40.680> in<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:42.530> out<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.710> another<00:00:43.920> 401

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
Jeep it was a built engine but they

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.889 
Jeep it was a built engine but they
didn't<00:00:46.620> need<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.770> distributor<00:00:47.399> so<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.899> scored

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
didn't need the distributor so I scored

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.510 
didn't need the distributor so I scored
that<00:00:49.309> new<00:00:50.309> cap<00:00:50.579> rotor<00:00:50.879> wires<00:00:51.300> plugs<00:00:52.399> needed<00:00:53.399> a

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.789 
the steering column let's see what else
oil<00:01:03.149> change<00:01:05.780> just<00:01:06.780> some<00:01:06.900> general<00:01:07.140> tweaking

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799

and when we drove it to town it was
overheating<00:01:10.939> and<00:01:11.939> coolant<00:01:12.630> was<00:01:12.990> pretty<00:01:13.200> nasty

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
I changed the coolant through a

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.600 
I changed the coolant through a
thermostat<00:01:18.479> in<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:19.310> drove<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.400> yesterday

this past year and I let somebody drive

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.960 
this past year and I let somebody drive
it<00:03:05.700> it<00:03:06.700> was<00:03:06.820> a<00:03:06.850> little<00:03:07.090> bit<00:03:07.180> hard<00:03:07.420> on<00:03:07.510> it<00:03:07.690> and<00:03:08.970> it

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
it it was a little bit hard on it and it

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.180 
it it was a little bit hard on it and it
slips<00:03:10.210> quite<00:03:10.450> a<00:03:10.480> bit<00:03:10.720> now<00:03:10.980> it's<00:03:11.980> still

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
slips quite a bit now it's still

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.590 
slips quite a bit now it's still
functional<00:03:12.910> but<00:03:13.450> I<00:03:13.480> find<00:03:13.840> that<00:03:14.020> if<00:03:14.440> you

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
functional but I find that if you

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.460 
functional but I find that if you
manually<00:03:16.600> shift<00:03:16.900> the<00:03:16.990> gears<00:03:17.200> if<00:03:17.350> you're

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
manually shift the gears if you're

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.140 
manually shift the gears if you're
really<00:03:17.650> getting<00:03:17.920> into<00:03:18.100> it<00:03:18.130> it<00:03:18.610> doesn't<00:03:18.820> slip

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
really getting into it it doesn't slip

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.640 
really getting into it it doesn't slip
but<00:03:19.540> if<00:03:19.630> you<00:03:19.750> just<00:03:19.930> kind<00:03:20.110> of<00:03:20.140> put<00:03:20.320> it<00:03:20.350> in<00:03:20.440> Drive

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
but if you just kind of put it in Drive

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.190 
but if you just kind of put it in Drive
and<00:03:20.860> go<00:03:20.950> it<00:03:21.100> will<00:03:21.250> slip<00:03:21.520> so<00:03:21.760> I<00:03:22.050> don't<00:03:23.050> think

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
and go it will slip so I don't think

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.600 
and go it will slip so I don't think
it's<00:03:23.290> too<00:03:23.440> long<00:03:23.590> for<00:03:23.800> this<00:03:23.920> world<00:03:24.130> but<00:03:24.220> for<00:03:24.490> now

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
it's too long for this world but for now

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.450 
it's too long for this world but for now
it's<00:03:24.790> still<00:03:24.880> totally<00:03:25.180> drivable<00:03:26.160> yeah<00:03:27.160> look<00:03:27.370> at

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:27.460 
it's still totally drivable yeah look at

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.370 
it's still totally drivable yeah look at
that<00:03:27.490> oil<00:03:27.730> pressure<00:03:27.940> pretty<00:03:28.840> good<00:03:29.050> for<00:03:29.260> an<00:03:29.320> old

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
that oil pressure pretty good for an old

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:39.010 
that oil pressure pretty good for an old
AMC<00:03:29.800> v8

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:47.790 

so

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.809 

there<00:03:48.800> it<00:03:48.920> is<00:03:49.010> that's<00:03:49.190> the<00:03:49.310> update<00:03:49.490> on<00:03:49.640> the

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
there it is that's the update on the

00:03:49.819 --> 00:04:02.380 
there it is that's the update on the
Cherokee<00:04:00.310> so<00:04:01.310> at<00:04:01.430> least<00:04:01.550> it's<00:04:01.790> drivable<00:04:02.120> again

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
Cherokee so at least it's drivable again

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.690 
Cherokee so at least it's drivable again
for<00:04:02.600> now
