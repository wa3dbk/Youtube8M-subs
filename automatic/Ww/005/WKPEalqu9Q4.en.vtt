00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.130
 hello how about you guys in this video I'm going to 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:14.650
 teach how to have cars with rust 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.200
 nitrous in gta 5 without needing 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.849
 have neither play pirate nor milks what 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.919
 we will do will be download the program 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:22.329
 program that you see that I play for 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:24.430
 I'll leave it in the description for it what 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:27.340
 downloads safely once 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.890
 we have opened we will load the know data 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.500
 that we will have gone from play 3 to a 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.880
 usb and the computer if you do not know how 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.650
 do it in the description is to leave a 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.710
 video of how to pass you know given to the 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.600
 computer and to be able to modify them 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.160
 once we have loaded it, we will choose the 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.170
 character of the story mode with which 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.580
 we want to do the trick and in this case 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.190
 the trick I'm going to do with michael 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:51.579
 then I go to maikel I go to 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:54.550
 garage and selected the car I want 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.170
 modify me just in case you do not have 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.600
 cars gives you some problem step 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.399
 any move I will leave you 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.050
 also a know dates with a game 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.340
 lacen action which is exactly the 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.799
 departure of this that you see that I am 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.780
 doing so that you have the same 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:08.770
 cars and you leave everything exactly the same 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.210
 and give us any 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.670
 problem 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.950
 whereby once we loaded this 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.720
 we will give the turbo saber we will give the 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.840
 nitrous oxide as you have seen it 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.930
 has given I will give you know file and now 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.450
 will create us the game with the car with 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.159
 the nitrous oxide once we have that 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.909
 already created game will happen again 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.490
 to the play 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.110
 we will copy it and we will simply have 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.420
 to do the trick to pass the car 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.770
 story mode to online mode you know 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.380
 how sections are made with a car 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.110
 anyone in an online in the saints 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.670
 custom let's go as if we were going to 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.640
 playstation store and at the same time not 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.190
 disconnect will create a bug will send us 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.200
 to story mode we approach the car that 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.500
 we want in this case the car with rust 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.780
 nitrous we bring you closer to custom jumps 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.160
 and we go to online mode once 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.200
 we have left hooked there in the 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.640
 door of the saints just when we 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.890
 let's go to online mode to session by 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.330
 invitation the car will be exactly 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.030
 where we have left him hooked in the 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.039
 door of the saints fair 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.440
 details to keep in mind of this trick 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.880
 you know how the tricks of 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.910
 Pass cars from story mode to mode 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.260
 online only cars under 50,000 are 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.970
 you want to put it in the garage now 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.650
 same I'm not sure if you can 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.810
 in the 110 make the subject of 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.980
 to get a car more than 50 thousand if 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.170
 there is some trick that works for 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.780
 get it in then just in case 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.700
 I have left you also he knows nothing of the 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.200
 I'll know in case you want it and if 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.030
 we anyone the one we like the most 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.170
 to you but I already tell you that it runs 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.629
 an awful lot once you have it is already 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.939
 just to activate the oxide give it 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.409
 to the left joystick to the joystick with the 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:47.870
 that we run the car with which 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:49.670
 We move the car's address to give it a 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.109
 click in, that is, press it 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.359
 as if we were going to run in the call of 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:55.519
 duty and once we press it we will see that 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:57.260
 hit the rust with the rust but it's not 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.549
 eternal is a pull like enough 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.470
 realistically the truth because he hit a 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:02.329
 tironcito but it's over so nothing 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.700
 guys I hope you like to build in 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:07.129
 many cars and that you spend so fucking 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.900
 mother with the trick tell you that I 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:11.629

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.970
 quite well explain it absolutely 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:26.840
 everything from pe to pa everything that does and does not 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.030
