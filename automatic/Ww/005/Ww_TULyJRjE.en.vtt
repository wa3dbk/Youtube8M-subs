00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.460
 welcome to a new episode 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.470
 incredible moves today by a right 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.080
 well-known example namely the lot 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:14.160
 Victor Korchnoi against ex 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:19.140
 world champion boris spasski in 1977 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.750
 played in belgrade coaching with white 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.570
 Suit what about both sides have 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:29.519
 very far advanced strong supports 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:36.450
 freibauern and now the question why 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:39.660
 here do continue and I 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.790
 would have me when I was younger mine 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.090
 Coach abandoned this disorder 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.100
 to solve and I think I have 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.230
 sat there for a long time 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.210
 half an hour that means you can 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.250
 invest a lot of time here too 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.629
 I also like disturbances on a board 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.120
 build up and just count as much as 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.969
 it works 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.769
 all right when you are ready me 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.670
 will now present the solution 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.950
 they will not want to see you either 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:16.140
 press on stop so first with something 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:18.360
 ladies b 7 that the train jumps one 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.509
 directly into the eye of the b7 or name p88 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.479
 attack above but can black 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.780
 actually to counterattack yourself 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.549
 blow da ma 4 and important topic in 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.180
 These two are the weak ones around 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:37.439
 she knows why she sends eight king 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:41.189
 h7 and maybe some of you have 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:44.820
 counted up here and thought now 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:48.869
 that maybe there knows here 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:52.430
 In the future hella ladies want chess 47 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.869
 and now from 10 2 covers the tower 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.659
 Do not discover directly but drop the 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.950
 Attack on the tower would now be white 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.259
 but profit is not the case 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:06.990
 what has its diabolical train namely 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:11.590
 lady a1 open at once loses white 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:14.920
 because as smart 1 would 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:18.370
 at the once poor, in addition to grund rhyme 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:23.099
 switches and so what else should know 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:25.500
 she comes once she hits 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:28.209
 tower 1 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:35.190
 here again we have that 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:35.190
 he can not do that 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:46.250
 because it could play three more here 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.250
 but now she sends six and 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.980
 black definitely here everything in 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.980
 order i think i put it 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.860
 balanced construction c7 and the belly the 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.880
 two will have to get aware yet 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.860
 look specifically how it goes on but 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:11.090
 for example, have me face wall 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.090
 the 8th 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.690
 yes that looks reasonable here and 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.670
 then at that time 70 tom schütz seven ladies 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.080
 Is she better and wants the ladies 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.370
 take off the board because the king of 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.510
 black is a bit weakened and 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:32.930
 Of course you are here now 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:34.910
 balanced here would be black times 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:43.220
 black always in this freiburg 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:45.950
 own ok and so the train shows 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.500
 but what I should go out on is that 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.350
 in many variants as I said the white 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.600
 reason is a problem and therefore 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.190
 kutcher just joined this one 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.220
 or has to play quiet train that 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:04.040
 also the best train and thus receives white 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:09.920
 a clear improvement now followed 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:13.520
 at that time four falstaff 7 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.709
 then just hit a5 and hit 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.419
 build on the 2 success of his more and 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.250
 important point here is the gifts 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:20.720
 Therefore one plays on the board of his 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.290
 roll because the black king is theirs 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:27.860
 is weakened and knows with the two 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.300
 difficult figures can put up drugs 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.750
 against the black king and had 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:37.570
 excellent profit opportunities followed at that time 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:42.890
 four and now beats white on the 2 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:45.490
 and now plays b7 and now just 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:49.250
 none can be dull in the position 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.750
 cancún has that actually sits 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.710
 remind me that part a little bit 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:58.210
 this time turin against jan o 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:01.340
 we saw clearly two weeks ago 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.560
 so too do the same structures know king 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.360
 now brings in safety and the 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:09.830
 black king on the other side 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:12.830
 just absolutely is not sure who did so 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:16.340
 can not defend capcom dede 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:18.770
 8 well now wins white are rome back 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:22.370
 and spin by director 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:24.680
 78 you come with the switch g7 chess 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.599
 that can just prevent black 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:30.819
 but it loses another 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:33.199
 farmers and now has one less here 

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:35.840
 I will finish the game shortly 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:37.729
 show how now bites here are more 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:42.919
 Of course , exploit has exploited as well 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:46.509
 its his active figurine and 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:50.180
 so 8.7 proves everything under control 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:53.990
 she fifth b7 black is on the 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:57.860
 Covered and white becomes the 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:06:02.750
 Farmers push forward for the pressure 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:05.990
 To increase the 45 harbor sound studio 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.880
 5 a course led course 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.449
 Now that white wholly wishes 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.710
 has two more no questions 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:15.099
 I still know a little bit further 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:19.250
 played and tried a bit but 

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:20.659
 here comes the final f6 and 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.500
 coaching is simply the stage play 

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:22.819
 calculated shortly 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.560
 maybe a bit longer than that 

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:26.090
 you should play for a while at Bayern 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.479
 always be sure that has become too 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:32.319
 and came to the conclusion that the won 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:40.729
 depending on the sex top six on the piece 

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:48.770
 66 63 57 king h4d 6 4 6 4 and future 

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:50.090
 the four and five more continue it 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.860
 h4 followed 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:57.169
 but now it was three more 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:07:00.889
 and that does not have to be more course 

00:06:57.169 --> 00:07:05.300
 everything is clear that we discussed 

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:09.080
 the game fun against paraguay against 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:11.090
 fun with the black nice quiet train 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.889
 at very many places always very 

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:14.870
 useful easy this air hole too 

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:16.460
 create it just no problems 

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:18.680
 But there is something here with the king 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.330
 especially that was absolutely sheep 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.340
 disorder is so both sides because 

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:25.340
 have crazy freibauern and still 

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:28.240
 takes a lot of time and that was the 

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:30.409
 decisive point all clear 

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:33.279
 I would say see you soon 

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:33.279
 again, it's good
