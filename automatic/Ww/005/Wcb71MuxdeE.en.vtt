not<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:02.070> lot<00:01:02.190> but<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.760> know<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.000> takes<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.239> lot

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
not a lot but it you know it takes a lot

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.859 
not a lot but it you know it takes a lot
of<00:01:03.390> patience<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.250> for<00:01:05.250> me<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.549> upload<00:01:05.970> videos

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
of patience to for me to upload videos

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.679 
of patience to for me to upload videos
like<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.110> so<00:01:07.530> but<00:01:08.040> either<00:01:08.159> way<00:01:08.540> this<00:01:09.540> is

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
like that so but either way this is

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.020 
like that so but either way this is
pretty<00:01:09.869> much<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.110> comparison<00:01:10.740> from<00:01:11.640> closed

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
pretty much a comparison from closed

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.320 
pretty much a comparison from closed
reduce<00:01:12.240> black<00:01:12.479> ops<00:01:12.770> FAL<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:13.979> might<00:01:14.790> 14<00:01:15.090> choose

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
reduce black ops FAL and might 14 choose

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.830 
reduce black ops FAL and might 14 choose
FAL<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.200> past<00:01:16.380> 12<00:01:16.740> from<00:01:17.340> both<00:01:17.549> games<00:01:17.850> so

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
FAL and this past 12 from both games so

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.039 
FAL and this past 12 from both games so
the<00:01:18.960> f<00:01:19.080> am<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.560> fell<00:01:19.979> in<00:01:20.159> this<00:01:20.310> game<00:01:20.520> works

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
the f am I fell in this game works

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.300 
the f am I fell in this game works
pretty<00:01:22.049> good<00:01:22.140> without<00:01:22.470> stopping<00:01:22.860> power<00:01:23.009> you

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
pretty good without stopping power you

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.249 
pretty good without stopping power you
don't<00:01:23.460> really<00:01:23.580> need<00:01:23.759> stopping<00:01:24.180> power<00:01:24.299> with

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
don't really need stopping power with

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.679 
don't really need stopping power with
that<00:01:25.950> perk<00:01:26.250> it's<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.850> one-shot<00:01:27.060> headshot

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
that perk it's a one-shot headshot

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.130 
that perk it's a one-shot headshot
without<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.500> think<00:01:28.560> it's<00:01:28.890> too<00:01:29.960> 33<00:01:30.960> shots

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
without it I think it's too 33 shots

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.020 
without it I think it's too 33 shots
long<00:01:31.500> range<00:01:31.770> two<00:01:32.040> shots<00:01:32.250> close<00:01:32.490> range<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.880> kill

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
long range two shots close range to kill

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.569 
long range two shots close range to kill
a<00:01:33.090> person<00:01:33.799> so<00:01:34.799> that's<00:01:34.979> why<00:01:35.100> I'm<00:01:35.189> using<00:01:35.310> cold

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
a person so that's why I'm using cold

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.160 
a person so that's why I'm using cold
blooded<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:36.060> suggest<00:01:36.450> running<00:01:36.630> something<00:01:37.049> like

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
blooded I suggest running something like

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.929 
blooded I suggest running something like
hard<00:01:37.439> line<00:01:37.619> or<00:01:37.860> cold<00:01:38.189> blooded<00:01:38.430> on<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.659> class

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
hard line or cold blooded on that class

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:42.859 
hard line or cold blooded on that class
when<00:01:41.939> you're<00:01:42.060> using<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.420> FAL<00:01:42.689> because

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
when you're using the FAL because

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.359 
when you're using the FAL because
stopping<00:01:43.049> power<00:01:43.290> is<00:01:43.470> really<00:01:43.740> it's<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.100> waste<00:01:44.250> of

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
stopping power is really it's a waste of

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.580

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
everybody knows that how incredibly good

this<00:01:49.649> gun<00:01:49.860> was<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.460> this<00:01:51.299> game<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:52.470> could

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
this gun was in this game you could

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.230 
this gun was in this game you could
blast<00:01:52.829> people<00:01:53.159> from<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.430> fucking<00:01:53.880> mile<00:01:54.060> away

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
blast people from a fucking mile away

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.730 
blast people from a fucking mile away
and<00:01:54.540> they<00:01:54.869> will<00:01:55.079> die<00:01:55.939> in<00:01:57.140> cove<00:01:58.140> duty<00:01:58.350> black<00:01:58.560> ops

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.149 
and they will die in cove duty black ops
they<00:01:58.950> nerfed<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.430> shotguns<00:01:59.909> but<00:02:00.119> they<00:02:00.689> made

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
they nerfed the shotguns but they made

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.830 
they nerfed the shotguns but they made
spas-12<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.520> semi-automatic<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:03.450> means<00:02:03.659> that

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
spas-12 a semi-automatic that means that

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.709 
spas-12 a semi-automatic that means that
the<00:02:03.990> pump<00:02:04.860> action<00:02:05.100> was<00:02:05.520> not<00:02:05.670> required<00:02:06.000> and

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
the pump action was not required and

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.089 
the pump action was not required and
over<00:02:06.869> here<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:07.079> ran<00:02:07.350> out<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.829> ammunition

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
over here I ran out of the ammunition

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.270 
over here I ran out of the ammunition
for<00:02:08.729> my<00:02:08.970> FAL<00:02:09.390> so<00:02:10.259> I'm<00:02:10.590> guessing<00:02:10.830> I'm<00:02:11.069> going<00:02:11.190> to

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
for my FAL so I'm guessing I'm going to

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.400 
for my FAL so I'm guessing I'm going to
switch<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.970> spas-12

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410
