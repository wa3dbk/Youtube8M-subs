00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.269
 Santa avoid being demanding and you 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:19.890
 It is cool to sign up the day 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:22.020
 It 's the same every year, Santa. 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.689
 has a huge job in the early hours of 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.910
 24th to 25th of December 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.310
 are thousands of gifts that have to 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.720
 be delivered this date all 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.250
 little children of the world 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.940
 so that not only the children 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.640
 and Christians, and I think it has the 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.719
 father and mother with a buck to help 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.820
 the Santa Claus 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.620
 just to give you an idea of ​​how much 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.309
 Santa have to spend gift 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.070
 every year only in 2012 in são paulo were 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.520
 spending more than 40 billion reais in 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.520
 Christmas 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:02.070
 gross is good to do a rough estimate 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.979
 we come to the conclusion that there are 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.100
 600 million children worldwide 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.080
 christian children and borges 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.340
 if we are on average two 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.790
 children at home 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.610
 will be 300 million houses that Daddy 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.900
 Noel has to visit on the 24th for 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.580
 day 25 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.250
 knowing that the good old man does not see any 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.409
 smart he certainly should use the spindle 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.610
 the land time to have more time to 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.159
 deliver the gifts 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.170
 then he travels with his sled for more or 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.100
 least two million kilometers per 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.380
 hour to deliver the 385 million 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.840
 tons of gifts the mayor of 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.570
 comparison the fastest object 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.390
 built by man until today is the probe 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.880
 space that travels little more than 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.899
 40 thousand kilometers an hour there in space 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.750
 logical 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.630
 remembering that he has to visit 1,700 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:02:00.079
 homes per second for weather in dad 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.079
 Noel your shirt and red coat too 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.240
 it is also the hard work and of course 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.660
 also that here we are 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.510
 disregarding the friction with which he would 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.180
 grow very fast blow up but he 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.579
 should use 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:24.569
 clothing that protects from heat and laces 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:24.569
 He is also a father. 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.390
 in 2007 a Swedish engineering company 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.330
 made the calculations and decided that the best 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.520
 place for Santa to get his 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.510
 day to deliver gifts is in the 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.660
 are reading this right. 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.700
 same 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.820
 and if you want to follow the path 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.830
 from Santa Claus on the 24th to the 25th of 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:59.130
 December google lends you a helping hand 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.320
 got in there on the holy tracker he goes 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.860
 to show you Santa's trajectory in the 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.490
 google max so this is it people enjoy 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.500

 enjoy the new year and not stay 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.940
 breaking the head a lot with this new 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.340
 Santa Claus is not there and certainly not 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.640
 There is science that explains everything magic. 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:26.910
 Okay Good, Christmas. Good. See you. 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:30.080
