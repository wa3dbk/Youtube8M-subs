you're<00:02:43.870> doing<00:02:44.080> later<00:02:44.200> so<00:02:44.590> what<00:02:44.800> we<00:02:44.980> know<00:02:45.190> is

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
you're doing later so what we know is

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.699 
you're doing later so what we know is
that<00:02:45.760> there<00:02:45.910> was<00:02:45.940> something<00:02:46.420> here<00:02:46.900> before<00:02:47.260> us

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
that there was something here before us

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.740 
that there was something here before us
and<00:02:48.010> what<00:02:48.100> we<00:02:48.220> think<00:02:48.430> what<00:02:48.760> we<00:02:48.880> hope<00:02:49.090> we<00:02:49.510> don't

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
and what we think what we hope we don't

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.750 
and what we think what we hope we don't
know<00:02:49.930> is<00:02:50.200> that<00:02:50.470> whatever<00:02:50.620> it<00:02:50.860> was<00:02:51.040> there<00:02:51.670> was

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
know is that whatever it was there was

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.030 
know is that whatever it was there was
probably<00:02:52.360> almost<00:02:52.600> definitely<00:02:53.230> something

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
probably almost definitely something

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.460 
probably almost definitely something
before<00:02:54.430> even<00:02:54.940> that's<00:02:55.209> maybe<00:02:55.540> an<00:02:55.810> old<00:02:55.990> field<00:02:56.260> or

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
before even that's maybe an old field or

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.040 
before even that's maybe an old field or
just<00:02:56.500> some<00:02:56.770> rough<00:02:57.160> ground<00:02:57.550> but<00:02:58.090> crucially<00:02:58.750> it

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
just some rough ground but crucially it

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.290 
just some rough ground but crucially it
would<00:02:59.260> have<00:02:59.350> been<00:02:59.500> an<00:02:59.709> immensely<00:03:00.250> old<00:03:00.610> field

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
would have been an immensely old field

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.040 
would have been an immensely old field
and<00:03:01.600> that's<00:03:02.050> gonna<00:03:02.260> be<00:03:02.440> very<00:03:02.470> exciting<00:03:04.050> okay

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
and that's gonna be very exciting okay

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.220 
and that's gonna be very exciting okay
that's<00:03:05.230> safe<00:03:05.680> to<00:03:05.830> go<00:03:05.950> one<00:03:06.400> at<00:03:06.519> a<00:03:06.550> time<00:03:06.730> okay

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
that's safe to go one at a time okay

00:03:08.230 --> 00:04:39.020 
that's safe to go one at a time okay
what

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.350

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
brilliant now this is a cross-section of

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.480 
brilliant now this is a cross-section of
a<00:04:45.300> tiny<00:04:45.540> part<00:04:45.990> of<00:04:46.080> the<00:04:46.320> world<00:04:46.710> you<00:04:47.190> see<00:04:47.370> this

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
a tiny part of the world you see this

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.490 
a tiny part of the world you see this
stuff<00:04:47.670> on<00:04:47.730> the<00:04:47.850> top<00:04:48.120> grass<00:04:48.660> that's<00:04:49.140> now<00:04:49.440> you

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
stuff on the top grass that's now you

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.630 
stuff on the top grass that's now you
can<00:04:49.800> get<00:04:49.950> that<00:04:50.040> anywhere<00:04:50.130> that's<00:04:50.520> not

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
can get that anywhere that's not

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.550 
can get that anywhere that's not
interesting<00:04:51.210> but<00:04:51.330> beneath<00:04:51.870> the<00:04:52.200> grass

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
interesting but beneath the grass

beneath<00:04:52.860> them<00:04:53.490> now<00:04:53.700> it<00:04:54.090> looks<00:04:54.330> like<00:04:54.420> there's

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
beneath them now it looks like there's

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.330 
beneath them now it looks like there's
something<00:04:54.840> buried<00:04:55.140> here<00:04:55.500> I<00:04:55.650> think<00:04:56.100> I<00:04:56.160> found

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
something buried here I think I found

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.550 
something buried here I think I found
something<00:04:56.640> I<00:04:57.030> think<00:04:57.300> I<00:04:57.600> found<00:04:57.780> something

something I think I found something

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.960 
something I think I found something
it<00:04:59.130> looks<00:04:59.280> like<00:04:59.400> some<00:04:59.580> sort<00:04:59.730> of<00:04:59.760> cutting

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
it looks like some sort of cutting

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.000 
it looks like some sort of cutting

Fred Fred put your tea down I'm holding

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.530 
Fred Fred put your tea down I'm holding
the<00:05:05.100> past<00:05:05.340> in<00:05:05.550> my<00:05:05.610> hand<00:05:05.820> what's<00:05:06.030> this<00:05:06.180> what<00:05:06.450> is

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
the past in my hand what's this what is

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.380 
the past in my hand what's this what is
it<00:05:06.690> that's<00:05:07.080> a<00:05:07.350> that's<00:05:08.010> a<00:05:08.130> bit<00:05:08.250> of<00:05:08.340> rock<00:05:08.550> it's<00:05:09.300> a

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
it that's a that's a bit of rock it's a

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.880 
it that's a that's a bit of rock it's a
stone<00:05:09.690> it's<00:05:09.990> a<00:05:10.020> bit<00:05:10.170> of<00:05:10.260> rock<00:05:10.410> it's<00:05:10.590> a<00:05:10.680> stone

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
stone it's a bit of rock it's a stone

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.890 
stone it's a bit of rock it's a stone
but<00:05:11.040> it's<00:05:11.190> definitely<00:05:11.310> older<00:05:11.940> fairness<00:05:12.750> the

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
but it's definitely older fairness the

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.240 
but it's definitely older fairness the
grass<00:05:13.110> which<00:05:13.410> means<00:05:13.710> that<00:05:13.950> the<00:05:14.040> mud

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
grass which means that the mud

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.830 
grass which means that the mud
underneath<00:05:14.640> where<00:05:14.940> I<00:05:14.970> got<00:05:15.240> the<00:05:15.360> stone<00:05:15.600> is

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
underneath where I got the stone is

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.840 
underneath where I got the stone is
older<00:05:16.200> still<00:05:16.410> it's<00:05:16.710> under<00:05:17.040> so<00:05:17.400> it's<00:05:17.550> older

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
older still it's under so it's older

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.730 
older still it's under so it's older
that's<00:05:18.060> the<00:05:18.630> rule<00:05:18.810> and<00:05:19.050> what's<00:05:19.169> so<00:05:19.350> exciting

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
that's the rule and what's so exciting

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.909 
that's the rule and what's so exciting
is<00:05:20.280> that<00:05:20.700> if<00:05:20.790> we<00:05:20.880> go<00:05:21.060> even<00:05:21.090> deeper<00:05:21.660> when<00:05:22.530> we<00:05:22.740> go

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
is that if we go even deeper when we go

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.490 
is that if we go even deeper when we go
even<00:05:23.130> deeper<00:05:23.460> we'll<00:05:24.150> be<00:05:24.300> going<00:05:24.570> into<00:05:24.690> mud<00:05:24.990> that

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
even deeper we'll be going into mud that

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:41.950 
even deeper we'll be going into mud that
is<00:05:25.560> even<00:05:25.950> older<00:05:26.100> than<00:05:26.460> that<00:05:26.960> let's<00:05:27.960> go

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.790
