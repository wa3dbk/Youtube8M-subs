00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:10.019
 there we are again with a new one in red 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.019
 world cup time and today we have the 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.160
 lg for sander 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.350
 we are a climb to london 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.820
 have been to see the device and me 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.710
 walk around and their while and it is 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.900
 a great moment to experience our first 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.970
 actually yes the review actually you too 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.740
 discuss his number in this video 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.390
 parts that immediately stand out 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.619
 device and let it start with none 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.859
 among others always something to report about 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.210
 such as the screen yes what for 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.450
 screen is the sander and what do you think 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.090
 of it 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.070
 it's an LCD screen and a cure 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.780
 with qhd resolution ' 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.850
 and actually they were there last year 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.870
 first me my cave to it and yes there 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.200
 is of course another twist to it 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.260
 screen 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.420
 this is slightly bent 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.700
 yes it is a bit known from the 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.379
 galaxy nexus from the past 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.449
 there she sat and pretty much a curve 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.010
 screen they have the jeep flex 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.500
 well that is really a nice device 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.510
 that I can really beat a table and 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.160
 they have learned lessons from that and that 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.899
 they have a whole lot more taken 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.339
 light cures for actually shaving 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.840
 yes you are using it 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.909
 pleasant working in measurement must also 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.320
 actually I had few of them 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.689
 opinion must be honest 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.400
 so yes for that matter I can do that 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.900
 got it in did not stand me with 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.430
 but also did not help that it is one 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.200
 little idea we brought him yes yes 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.900
 something below the findings finding 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.130
 in any case screen size 5 minutes 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.689
 years can actually follow 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.710
 just join this year with the top 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.930
 devices 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.630
 design after the back is recognizable 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.729
 the button is there again the camera is there 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.290
 the volume keys and the front I have 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.790
 me and pannas shows the device and 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.619
 they said he seems very ordinary 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.400
 worried and then I actually have to 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.040
 agree with 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.240
 he has some of it yes yes that is 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.970
 not in itself wrong but it is not 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.310
 unique no but I can live well 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.049
 with them with the design and with it 5.5 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.460
 inch screen and the rear can also 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.600
 not really unique 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.220
 except for those buttons on the 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.390
 backside version that we have is not 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.979
 nothing more from me 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.420
 there is also a leather version 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.710
 nobody and lungs can test anyone 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.420
 which is not yet available for us but 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.820
 I just want to say that 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.280
 that leather back is very beautiful and like 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.140
 you see the pictures of that plastic 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.649
 back then you think well this goes 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.090
 not become him 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.830
 but I really think it's one 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.580
 whole lot better-looking than you would 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.870
 to think 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.580
 they have seen those pictures what more 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.410
 the battery three days at a jan per hour 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.390
 we should last longer all day 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.640
 persevere and I come on is further along 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.900
 he is definitely doing better with the s6 and 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.290
 I generally reach the end of it 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.970
 day 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.520
 so I actually have very little there 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.200
 another part to complain about 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.880
 device is the camera 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.250
 16 megapixel camera bridge a lot of work 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.690
 spent and mini-engine extra options 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.820
 institutions is like that 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.260
 configure 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.180
 then the other diaphragm is on 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.040
 fm point 8 mover so much more light 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.930
 and make the political mine yes 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.180
 his muscles were actually flex 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.860
 so for that matter camera very well and 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.990
 where I myself am a fan of the lg 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.670
 Also a tea tree is both beds 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.380
 autofocus that works just as well 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.120
 printed on the screen 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.800
 focus somewhere on print sanders and and 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.300
 so immediately focus on the other point again 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.200
 work back there in October 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.790
 reader for 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.850
 sits at the back of the room 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.470
 sit and a laser and those who estimate 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.240
 distance and that ensures you 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.620
 so you can write immediately in one go 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.390
 not new but I still want it 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.390
 always incredibly good 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.970
 of course we have software and soul x4 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.440
 point zero very mouthful but I am not 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.900
 totally devastated by the minute how they 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.430
 and on the other hand it is 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.560
 all just what are flattened colors 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.780
 duller, less furious 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.209
 yes that is a positive step plus he 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.650
 runs on Android 5 point one first 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.230
 don't allow nexus as they try 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.540
 performance of van lg 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.769
 no summarized the lg for very good ones 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.750
 camera design 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.519
 well looks better than in the pictures 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.750
 but you have a choice especially go for it 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.760
 the learning version 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.980
 screen sanders enthusiastic so that is 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.510
 always good yes definitely an improvement 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.430
 compared to last year 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.650
 software you have to love it but there 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.970
 of course other options were one 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.750
 another lunch or something similar 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.489
 put 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.980
 so yes actually i am predominantly 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.630
 positive about the lg for he has not 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.010
 a rough function that really stands out 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.940
 and compared to other device above the 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.890
 leather back 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.989
 but that is of course an option only 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.190
 he can he can do fine I am 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.989
 very curious how they will do it 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.400
 above all just looking at the pricing 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.010
 because a thousand to compare with galaxy 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.019
 s6 and for you he had a reasonable one 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.560
 great price advantage that that nsdap piece 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.090
 cheaper was the lg for him anyway 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.799
 to do 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.250
 why and the leather back to the 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.250
 next time
