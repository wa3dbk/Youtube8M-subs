00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.290
 the Colombian forward Radamel Falcao 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.819
 GarcÃ­a presented this Thursday officially 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.370
 in Colombia to his two exclusive watches 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.870
 designed by the Swiss brand Hublot in 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.490
 means of a social campaign with the 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:17.240
 community of santa's big bog 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:20.370
 marta but good night everyone first 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:23.630
 very happy he thanked God for doing 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.630
 part of this magnificent project 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:29.530
 able to join 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.600
 Y 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.510
 and be part of the United Nations 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.190
 to help a very community 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.600
 in need of our country at dinner 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:43.490
 full big santa saint that I had the 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.620
 opportunity to visit them yesterday 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.260
 to know them in the conditions that 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:52.540
 they are currently living off their 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:55.300
 needs and their projects for a 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:01:00.550
 for a better quality of life 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.550
 and I think that this 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.840
 is the new plan that is being made 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:12.130
 and it's going to help them a lot 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.359
 allow having a sports development 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.850
 labor 

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:20.400
 and that ultimately we're going to do the 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.080
 benefited not only 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.740
 in santa marta but in all colombia 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.540
 because there 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.360
 people trained to perform 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.939
 different types of jobs and they're going to 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.560
 serve for the progress of our country 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:38.409
 so for me 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.880
 and being part of that project fills me 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:44.119
 of joy and being able to give back 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.800
 something to say where I was born and 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.550
 it comforts a lot 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.550
 nothing else 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.500
 the Colombian forward also spoke of 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.259
 its sports news with the club 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:01.060
 monaco and the Colombian national team 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:04.710
 and the Monaco is for a sports project 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.710
 in the long term in which they want 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.599
 will reach the highest level of football 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:12.680
 European and surely that is only going to 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.390
 get a single season so 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.390
 it is guaranteed that I will be more time 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.069
 later I do not know what might happen I do not know 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.549
 what will happen in an hour in my life 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:25.150
 but my main idea is to go with a 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:29.030
 long-term project and the one of freis 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.400
 surely they have seen it and will be 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.790
 interested because he is a great player and 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.129
 for me I hope it can go but it 's 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:41.389
 very important nucleus where surely 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:43.520
 they will not let go easily out I 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:46.310
 I think Colombia 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.320
 has players that many selections 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.230
 important today in the world not the 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.660
 have we are growing to demonstrate a 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.230
 evolution and let's hope that this 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.640
 maturity 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.750
 and continues to increase from here to what the 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:07.230
 rest of the world cup 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.230
 and well we are very close to that I know 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.799
 we have had a number of points that 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.959
 it has allowed us to depend on us 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:17.180
 same I think if at the moment he 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.180
 arrived a year ago 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.300
 I do not know if they have signed the moment in the 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.230
 that we are with the elections in all 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.450
 we all signed it 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.650
 to closed eyes playing badly playing well 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.129
 but in the amount of points that 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.129
 we have 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:37.200
 gives us allows us to know what against 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.780
 Ecuador 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.629
 winning we are very close to brazil 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.420
 hopefully that's the way the results exist 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:48.690
 they give us and then we can be 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.700
 again with james on the team is very 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.930
 good we have a great relationship is a 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.880
 excellent player to contribute 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.980
 very much to the team that is going to be 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.510
 fundamental and also for the selection 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.780
 colombian be good that we are together 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.780
 Playing 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:07.330
 the name of the girl I still do not know 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.330
 in surprise
