00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:19.529 
line all the way to the end of where I

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:23.300

have this color I'm just going to do a
really<00:05:23.550> thin<00:05:23.849> line<00:05:24.090> I<00:05:24.120> don't<00:05:24.509> know<00:05:24.569> if<00:05:24.629> it's

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
really thin line I don't know if it's

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.839 
really thin line I don't know if it's
even<00:05:25.259> going<00:05:25.469> to<00:05:25.560> show<00:05:25.710> up<00:05:25.919> the<00:05:26.340> applicator<00:05:26.699> of

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:26.849 
even going to show up the applicator of

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:28.070 
even going to show up the applicator of
this<00:05:27.000> is<00:05:27.150> really<00:05:27.300> thin<00:05:27.569> so<00:05:27.719> that's<00:05:27.900> really

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
this is really thin so that's really

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.260 
this is really thin so that's really
good<00:05:28.379> for<00:05:28.620> trying<00:05:29.460> to<00:05:29.520> get<00:05:29.639> a<00:05:29.669> really<00:05:29.909> precise

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
good for trying to get a really precise

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.710 
good for trying to get a really precise
line

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.870 

and<00:05:33.840> that<00:05:34.320> is<00:05:34.410> the<00:05:34.530> eyes<00:05:34.650> completely<00:05:35.160> done<00:05:35.520> and

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
and that is the eyes completely done and

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.160 
and that is the eyes completely done and
then<00:05:36.120> I<00:05:36.180> kept<00:05:36.420> most<00:05:36.540> of<00:05:36.660> the<00:05:36.750> face<00:05:36.930> really

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:37.170 
then I kept most of the face really

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.230 
then I kept most of the face really
natural<00:05:37.710> just<00:05:38.010> because<00:05:38.250> I<00:05:38.280> have<00:05:38.820> so<00:05:39.090> much

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
natural just because I have so much

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.480 
natural just because I have so much
going<00:05:39.480> on<00:05:39.720> that<00:05:39.960> if<00:05:40.290> you<00:05:40.410> had<00:05:40.620> a<00:05:40.890> bright<00:05:41.310> flash

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
going on that if you had a bright flash

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:42.950 
going on that if you had a bright flash
and<00:05:41.910> bright<00:05:42.090> lips<00:05:42.360> you<00:05:42.540> would<00:05:42.720> look

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
and bright lips you would look

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.020 
and bright lips you would look
ridiculous<00:05:43.200> I<00:05:43.830> ended<00:05:44.340> up<00:05:44.370> just<00:05:44.550> using<00:05:44.670> a<00:05:44.910> bit
