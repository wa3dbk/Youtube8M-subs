00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.569 

sounds<00:00:54.180> pretty<00:00:54.390> bad<00:00:54.510> but<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.770> happens<00:00:56.280> to

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
sounds pretty bad but that happens to

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.400 
sounds pretty bad but that happens to
some<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.879> your<00:00:57.000> violins<00:00:57.390> especially<00:00:58.050> if<00:00:58.170> you

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
some of your violins especially if you

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
buy it new and have it shipped you it

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.679 
buy it new and have it shipped you it
can<00:01:03.989> sound<00:01:04.170> looking<00:01:04.619> bad<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:05.519> when<00:01:06.299> it's<00:01:06.450> this

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
can sound looking bad so when it's this

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.740 
can sound looking bad so when it's this
of<00:01:07.020> our<00:01:07.920> tune<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.729> have<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.150> use<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.510> pegs

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
of our tune you have to use the pegs

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.560 
of our tune you have to use the pegs
which<00:01:10.290> are<00:01:10.409> kind<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.590> scary<00:01:10.890> for<00:01:11.100> beginners

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
which are kind of scary for beginners

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.910 
which are kind of scary for beginners
when<00:01:12.570> your<00:01:12.720> vile<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.020> close<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.380> being<00:01:13.530> in<00:01:13.680> tune

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
when your vile is close to being in tune

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.310 
when your vile is close to being in tune

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
you can use the fine tuners let's see if

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.999 
you can use the fine tuners let's see if
I<00:01:16.380> can<00:01:16.530> put<00:01:16.740> these<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.040> camera<00:01:17.659> these

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
I can put these in the camera these

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.010 
I can put these in the camera these
little<00:01:20.119> screws<00:01:21.119> down<00:01:21.330> here<00:01:21.630> on<00:01:21.750> your<00:01:21.869> tail

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
little screws down here on your tail

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.740 
little screws down here on your tail
piece<00:01:22.259> those<00:01:23.250> are<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.850> safest<00:01:24.330> way<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.509> tune

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
piece those are the safest way to tune

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.620 
piece those are the safest way to tune
your<00:01:24.869> violin<00:01:25.320> but<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.280> has<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.640> be<00:01:26.670> pretty

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
your violin but it has to be pretty

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.929 
your violin but it has to be pretty
close<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.869> being<00:01:28.229> in<00:01:28.409> tune<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.040> then<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.759> just

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
close to being in tune and then you just

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.550 
close to being in tune and then you just
use<00:01:30.119> these<00:01:30.360> for<00:01:30.659> getting<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.200> rest<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.500> the

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
use these for getting it the rest of the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.740 
use these for getting it the rest of the
way<00:01:31.710> in<00:01:31.860> tune<00:01:32.100> those<00:01:33.000> are<00:01:33.150> safe<00:01:33.329> because<00:01:33.570> you

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
way in tune those are safe because you

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.719 
way in tune those are safe because you
can<00:01:33.990> turn<00:01:34.110> them<00:01:34.259> as<00:01:34.350> far<00:01:34.560> as<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.680> want<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.670> you

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
can turn them as far as you want and you

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.270 
can turn them as far as you want and you
can't<00:01:36.240> break<00:01:36.720> your<00:01:36.780> strings<00:01:37.259> by<00:01:37.770> using<00:01:38.040> these

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
can't break your strings by using these

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.399 
can't break your strings by using these
so<00:01:38.970> if<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.270> if<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.600> have<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.780> private<00:01:40.259> teacher

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
so if you if you have a private teacher

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.050 
so if you if you have a private teacher
they'll<00:01:40.799> turn<00:01:40.979> your<00:01:41.189> violin<00:01:41.490> for<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.820> and

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
they'll turn your violin for you and

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.120 
they'll turn your violin for you and
then<00:01:42.240> when<00:01:43.110> you're<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.500> shouldn't<00:01:43.890> really<00:01:44.009> go

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
then when you're it shouldn't really go

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.249 
then when you're it shouldn't really go
out<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.369> tune<00:01:44.579> very<00:01:44.850> much<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.659> can<00:01:45.899> fix<00:01:46.110> it

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
out of tune very much so you can fix it

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.560 
out of tune very much so you can fix it
by<00:01:46.380> just<00:01:46.590> turning<00:01:46.740> these<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.040> little<00:01:47.340> bit<00:01:47.570> and

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
by just turning these a little bit and

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.630 
by just turning these a little bit and
you<00:01:48.689> don't<00:01:49.409> worry<00:01:49.890> about<00:01:49.979> breaking<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.399> string

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
you don't worry about breaking a string

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.340 
you don't worry about breaking a string
because<00:01:51.240> when<00:01:51.450> they<00:01:51.540> get<00:01:51.689> too<00:01:51.840> far<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.259> they

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
because when they get too far and they

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.580 
because when they get too far and they
won't<00:01:52.530> go<00:01:52.619> any<00:01:52.799> farther<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:54.320> so<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.409> can't

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
won't go any farther and so you can't

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.010 
won't go any farther and so you can't
break<00:01:55.680> space<00:01:55.920> however<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:57.210> pegs<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.840> can

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
break space however the pegs you can

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.810 
break space however the pegs you can
break<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.229> string<00:01:58.409> very<00:01:58.860> very<00:01:59.340> easily<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:01.820> when

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
break a string very very easily so when

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.999 
break a string very very easily so when
you<00:02:02.880> turn<00:02:03.060> them<00:02:03.350> you<00:02:04.350> only<00:02:04.500> watch<00:02:04.710> them<00:02:04.890> a

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
you turn them you only watch them a

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.639 
you turn them you only watch them a
little<00:02:05.070> bit<00:02:05.369> at<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.670> time<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:06.860> then

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
little bit at a time and then

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:09.899 
little bit at a time and then
pluck<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:09.069> string<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.459> whole<00:02:09.580> time<00:02:09.759> you're

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:09.909 
pluck the string the whole time you're

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:13.380 
pluck the string the whole time you're
turning<00:02:10.239> it<00:02:10.360> to<00:02:10.929> listen<00:02:11.319> and<00:02:12.120> turn<00:02:13.120> it<00:02:13.239> very

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
turning it to listen and turn it very

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.240 
turning it to listen and turn it very
slowly<00:02:13.690> you<00:02:14.530> don't<00:02:14.620> want<00:02:14.799> to<00:02:14.860> just<00:02:14.950> take<00:02:15.129> it

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
slowly you don't want to just take it

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.920 
slowly you don't want to just take it
and<00:02:15.340> give<00:02:15.489> it<00:02:15.519> a<00:02:15.640> big<00:02:15.790> turn<00:02:16.120> because<00:02:16.840> the

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
and give it a big turn because the

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.509 
and give it a big turn because the
violin<00:02:17.319> the<00:02:17.349> strings<00:02:17.590> go<00:02:17.709> up<00:02:17.950> and<00:02:18.069> pitch<00:02:18.220> very

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
violin the strings go up and pitch very

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.149 
violin the strings go up and pitch very
quickly<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.810> you<00:02:20.379> don't<00:02:20.590> want<00:02:20.769> to<00:02:20.830> go<00:02:20.920> past

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:21.159 
quickly and you don't want to go past

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:24.420 
quickly and you don't want to go past
the<00:02:21.640> pitch<00:02:22.180> of<00:02:22.720> what<00:02:22.989> it's<00:02:23.110> supposed<00:02:23.349> to<00:02:23.409> be<00:02:23.590> or

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
the pitch of what it's supposed to be or

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.949 
the pitch of what it's supposed to be or
it'll<00:02:24.580> break<00:02:24.879> the<00:02:25.030> string<00:02:25.209> especially<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:25.930> E

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
it'll break the string especially the E

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.339 
it'll break the string especially the E
string<00:02:26.290> will<00:02:26.500> break<00:02:26.590> really<00:02:27.069> easy<00:02:27.360> so<00:02:28.360> if<00:02:29.230> it

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
string will break really easy so if it

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:30.270 
string will break really easy so if it
happens<00:02:29.470> you<00:02:29.739> just<00:02:29.769> going<00:02:30.010> to<00:02:30.129> buy<00:02:30.250> another

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
happens you just going to buy another

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.210 
happens you just going to buy another
string<00:02:30.849> you<00:02:31.390> know<00:02:31.480> we<00:02:31.629> all<00:02:31.750> break<00:02:31.989> strings<00:02:32.379> but

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
string you know we all break strings but

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.490 
string you know we all break strings but
we<00:02:33.310> don't<00:02:33.459> want<00:02:33.610> to<00:02:33.730> so<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.959> violin<00:02:35.290> is<00:02:35.319> very

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
we don't want to so the violin is very

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.660 
we don't want to so the violin is very
have<00:02:35.650> tuned<00:02:36.750> what<00:02:37.750> are<00:02:37.810> we<00:02:37.870> gonna<00:02:37.989> do<00:02:38.170> about<00:02:38.200> it

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
have tuned what are we gonna do about it

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.270 
have tuned what are we gonna do about it
well<00:02:39.670> we<00:02:40.150> know<00:02:40.269> we<00:02:40.390> can't<00:02:40.629> use<00:02:40.690> these<00:02:41.079> so<00:02:41.920> but

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
well we know we can't use these so but

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.170 
well we know we can't use these so but
we're<00:02:42.370> gonna<00:02:42.459> want<00:02:42.670> to<00:02:42.730> use<00:02:42.819> them<00:02:42.940> later<00:02:43.030> so

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
we're gonna want to use them later so

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.240 
we're gonna want to use them later so
what<00:02:43.480> you<00:02:43.599> should<00:02:43.660> do<00:02:43.959> is<00:02:44.379> loosen<00:02:44.890> them<00:02:45.129> off

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
what you should do is loosen them off

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.000 
what you should do is loosen them off
all<00:02:45.489> the<00:02:45.670> way<00:02:46.079> so<00:02:47.079> there<00:02:47.379> is<00:02:47.470> loose<00:02:47.650> as<00:02:47.829> they'll

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
all the way so there is loose as they'll

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.520 
all the way so there is loose as they'll
go<00:02:48.160> without<00:02:48.310> falling<00:02:48.730> out<00:02:49.019> because<00:02:50.019> that<00:02:50.410> way

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
go without falling out because that way

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.490 
go without falling out because that way
they're<00:02:50.709> ready<00:02:50.920> when<00:02:51.489> you<00:02:51.640> get<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:53.200> string

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
they're ready when you get the string

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.289 
they're ready when you get the string
close<00:02:54.159> to<00:02:54.370> being<00:02:54.549> in<00:02:54.670> tune<00:02:54.849> with<00:02:55.030> your<00:02:55.090> peg

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
close to being in tune with your peg

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.539 
close to being in tune with your peg
then<00:02:56.019> you<00:02:56.109> can<00:02:56.260> use<00:02:56.379> these<00:02:56.590> again<00:02:56.859> so<00:02:57.190> and

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
then you can use these again so and

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.789 
then you can use these again so and
that's<00:02:58.150> also<00:02:58.299> what<00:02:58.510> you<00:02:58.569> have<00:02:58.750> to<00:02:58.959> do<00:02:59.140> if<00:02:59.530> they

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
that's also what you have to do if they

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.380 
that's also what you have to do if they
get<00:02:59.980> screwed<00:03:00.400> in<00:03:00.549> all<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:00.790> ways<00:03:00.909> you<00:03:01.150> can't

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
get screwed in all the ways you can't

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.149 
get screwed in all the ways you can't
turn<00:03:01.569> them<00:03:01.690> anymore<00:03:01.870> then<00:03:02.680> you<00:03:02.799> have<00:03:02.920> to<00:03:03.040> back

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:03.159 
turn them anymore then you have to back

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:05.099 
turn them anymore then you have to back
them<00:03:03.370> off<00:03:03.459> all<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:03.819> way<00:03:03.909> and<00:03:04.720> take<00:03:04.900> up<00:03:05.019> the

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109 
them off all the way and take up the

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:06.630 
them off all the way and take up the
slack<00:03:05.140> with<00:03:05.470> your<00:03:05.590> peg<00:03:05.769> so<00:03:06.129> you<00:03:06.220> can<00:03:06.370> use<00:03:06.489> these

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
slack with your peg so you can use these

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.160 
slack with your peg so you can use these
again<00:03:06.909> so<00:03:07.329> we're<00:03:07.480> going<00:03:07.599> to<00:03:07.659> make<00:03:07.780> sure<00:03:08.019> that

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
again so we're going to make sure that

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.770 
again so we're going to make sure that
our<00:03:08.230> fine<00:03:08.440> tuners<00:03:08.829> are<00:03:08.980> loose<00:03:09.450> now<00:03:10.450> again<00:03:10.659> this

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
our fine tuners are loose now again this

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.059 
our fine tuners are loose now again this
is<00:03:10.840> only<00:03:11.079> in<00:03:11.260> your<00:03:11.290> violence<00:03:11.650> really<00:03:11.859> out<00:03:12.040> of

of what to do so we're gonna just sit
although<00:03:21.010> all<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.489> strings<00:03:21.790> of<00:03:21.910> way<00:03:22.120> way<00:03:22.269> flat

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
although all the strings of way way flat

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.680 
although all the strings of way way flat
they're<00:03:23.980> totally<00:03:24.400> flat<00:03:24.609> so<00:03:25.120> we're<00:03:25.569> gonna

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
they're totally flat so we're gonna

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.559 
they're totally flat so we're gonna
gradually<00:03:26.169> take<00:03:26.440> each<00:03:26.650> each<00:03:27.190> one<00:03:27.250> up<00:03:27.760> so<00:03:28.150> see

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
gradually take each each one up so see

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.599 
gradually take each each one up so see
if<00:03:28.629> I<00:03:28.720> can<00:03:29.819> show<00:03:30.819> you<00:03:30.879> what<00:03:31.150> I'm<00:03:31.209> doing<00:03:32.609> you

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 
if I can show you what I'm doing you

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.729 
if I can show you what I'm doing you
want<00:03:33.819> to<00:03:33.940> push<00:03:34.269> in<00:03:34.540> on<00:03:34.930> the<00:03:35.109> peg<00:03:35.319> when<00:03:35.620> you're

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
want to push in on the peg when you're

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.080 
want to push in on the peg when you're
turning<00:03:36.069> it<00:03:36.220> to<00:03:36.849> try<00:03:37.030> and<00:03:37.150> make<00:03:37.269> it<00:03:37.299> whole

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
turning it to try and make it whole

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.610 
turning it to try and make it whole
because<00:03:40.090> sometimes<00:03:40.780> they<00:03:40.959> kind<00:03:41.109> of<00:03:41.199> get<00:03:41.379> loose

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
because sometimes they kind of get loose

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.039 
because sometimes they kind of get loose
and<00:03:41.949> then<00:03:42.069> they<00:03:42.190> you<00:03:42.669> can't<00:03:42.940> keep<00:03:43.629> it<00:03:43.810> tight

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
and then they you can't keep it tight

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.539 
and then they you can't keep it tight
they<00:03:44.290> just<00:03:44.500> keep<00:03:44.650> slipping<00:03:45.040> and<00:03:45.160> slipping<00:03:45.310> and

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
they just keep slipping and slipping and

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.119 
they just keep slipping and slipping and
slipping<00:03:45.699> so<00:03:46.389> push<00:03:46.629> it<00:03:46.750> in<00:03:46.870> pretty<00:03:47.049> hard<00:03:47.290> while

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:48.129 
slipping so push it in pretty hard while

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:50.069 
slipping so push it in pretty hard while
you're<00:03:48.310> turning<00:03:48.639> it<00:03:48.819> turn<00:03:49.419> it<00:03:49.540> slowly<00:03:49.720> but

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
you're turning it turn it slowly but

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.339 
you're turning it turn it slowly but
push<00:03:50.260> it<00:03:50.410> in<00:03:50.530> pretty<00:03:50.769> hard<00:03:51.569> and<00:03:52.569> also<00:03:53.139> I

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
push it in pretty hard and also I

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:55.770 
push it in pretty hard and also I
probably<00:03:54.160> can't<00:03:54.879> really<00:03:55.060> show<00:03:55.269> this<00:03:55.510> on<00:03:55.690> the

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
probably can't really show this on the

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.099 
probably can't really show this on the
camera<00:03:55.989> but<00:03:56.699> if<00:03:57.699> you<00:03:57.910> have<00:03:58.090> slipping<00:03:58.480> pegs<00:03:58.750> it

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
camera but if you have slipping pegs it

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.979 
camera but if you have slipping pegs it
really<00:03:59.349> helps<00:03:59.650> to<00:03:59.829> wrap<00:04:00.010> the<00:04:00.250> string<00:04:00.989> really

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
really helps to wrap the string really

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.619 
really helps to wrap the string really
tie<00:04:02.260> it<00:04:02.319> up<00:04:02.470> against<00:04:02.980> the<00:04:03.190> peg<00:04:03.519> box<00:04:03.790> not<00:04:04.389> not

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629 
tie it up against the peg box not not

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:05.939 
tie it up against the peg box not not
super<00:04:04.989> tight<00:04:05.169> so<00:04:05.349> you<00:04:05.410> don't<00:04:05.560> want<00:04:05.680> to<00:04:05.739> crack

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:05.949 
super tight so you don't want to crack

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:08.009 
super tight so you don't want to crack
your<00:04:05.980> peg<00:04:06.310> box<00:04:06.579> but<00:04:06.849> that<00:04:07.060> can<00:04:07.690> help<00:04:07.840> a

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
your peg box but that can help a

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.309 
your peg box but that can help a
slipping<00:04:08.379> peg<00:04:08.620> just<00:04:08.949> by<00:04:10.079> restringing<00:04:11.079> it<00:04:11.260> a

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
slipping peg just by restringing it a

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.170 
slipping peg just by restringing it a
little<00:04:11.470> differently<00:04:11.889> so<00:04:12.579> the<00:04:12.699> string<00:04:12.940> is<00:04:13.060> up

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
little differently so the string is up

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.020 
little differently so the string is up
against<00:04:13.510> peg<00:04:13.690> box<00:04:13.900> so<00:04:14.680> we're<00:04:14.829> gonna<00:04:15.030> we're

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
against peg box so we're gonna we're

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.190 
against peg box so we're gonna we're
gonna<00:04:16.090> take<00:04:16.299> the<00:04:16.389> a<00:04:16.419> string<00:04:16.780> up<00:04:16.900> just<00:04:17.079> a<00:04:17.169> little

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
gonna take the a string up just a little

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.720 
gonna take the a string up just a little
bit<00:04:17.409> and<00:04:17.890> push<00:04:18.549> it<00:04:18.669> in

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.920 

then<00:04:22.730> we're<00:04:22.880> going<00:04:23.000> to<00:04:23.030> take<00:04:23.210> the<00:04:23.360> D<00:04:23.510> string<00:04:23.720> up

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
then we're going to take the D string up

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.150 
then we're going to take the D string up
a<00:04:24.020> little<00:04:24.170> bit<00:04:26.200> just<00:04:27.200> a<00:04:27.320> little<00:04:27.560> now<00:04:28.070> we're

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
a little bit just a little now we're

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.270 
a little bit just a little now we're
going<00:04:28.250> to<00:04:28.310> do<00:04:28.400> the<00:04:28.760> g<00:04:28.910> string<00:04:30.160> then<00:04:31.160> we're

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
going to do the g string then we're

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:39.370 
going to do the g string then we're
going<00:04:31.400> to<00:04:31.460> do<00:04:31.550> the<00:04:31.640> E<00:04:31.670> string<00:04:37.570> then<00:04:38.570> if<00:04:39.080> you

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
going to do the E string then if you

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.850 
going to do the E string then if you
have<00:04:39.530> a<00:04:39.560> tuner<00:04:41.350> then<00:04:42.350> you<00:04:42.410> can<00:04:42.560> start<00:04:42.740> using

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
have a tuner then you can start using

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.750 
have a tuner then you can start using
the<00:04:43.040> tuner<00:04:43.250> to<00:04:43.340> help<00:04:43.720> so<00:04:44.980> this<00:04:45.980> is<00:04:46.160> my<00:04:46.310> tuner

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
the tuner to help so this is my tuner

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:52.630 
the tuner to help so this is my tuner
this<00:04:49.000> is<00:04:50.000> the<00:04:50.090> type<00:04:50.270> r<00:04:50.300> you<00:04:50.480> turn<00:04:50.660> on<00:04:51.400> and<00:04:52.400> then

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.640 
this is the type r you turn on and then

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.790 
this is the type r you turn on and then
you<00:04:52.790> listen<00:04:53.000> to<00:04:53.270> it<00:04:53.360> and<00:04:53.540> turn<00:04:54.230> your<00:04:54.410> string<00:04:54.620> to

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
you listen to it and turn your string to

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.749 
you listen to it and turn your string to
it

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:55.759 
it

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:57.969 
it
so<00:04:56.539> that's<00:04:56.719> the<00:04:56.809> type<00:04:56.960> I'm<00:04:57.199> going<00:04:57.229> to<00:04:57.589> use<00:04:57.770> you

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
so that's the type I'm going to use you

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:00.700 
so that's the type I'm going to use you
might<00:04:58.129> have<00:04:58.309> the<00:04:58.460> type<00:04:58.639> that<00:04:58.849> tells<00:04:59.210> you<00:04:59.710> you

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
might have the type that tells you you

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.469 
might have the type that tells you you
pluck<00:05:00.949> the<00:05:01.129> string<00:05:01.430> and<00:05:01.610> then<00:05:01.699> it<00:05:02.089> has<00:05:02.449> a

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479 
pluck the string and then it has a

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:04.089 
pluck the string and then it has a
little<00:05:02.659> arrow<00:05:02.930> that<00:05:03.020> shows<00:05:03.229> you<00:05:03.589> if<00:05:03.650> it's<00:05:03.860> flat

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:04.099 
little arrow that shows you if it's flat

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:06.549 
little arrow that shows you if it's flat
or<00:05:04.309> sharp<00:05:04.339> or<00:05:04.729> whatever<00:05:05.229> but<00:05:06.229> the<00:05:06.349> thing<00:05:06.529> about

00:05:06.549 --> 00:05:06.559 
or sharp or whatever but the thing about

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:08.260 
or sharp or whatever but the thing about
that<00:05:06.800> is<00:05:06.949> when<00:05:07.370> you<00:05:07.400> when<00:05:07.879> your<00:05:07.999> string<00:05:08.210> is

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
that is when you when your string is

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.850 
that is when you when your string is
really<00:05:08.539> out<00:05:08.809> of<00:05:08.839> tune<00:05:09.169> and<00:05:09.379> the<00:05:09.439> tuner<00:05:09.710> won't

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
really out of tune and the tuner won't

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.170 
really out of tune and the tuner won't
know<00:05:09.979> what<00:05:10.159> note<00:05:10.309> you're<00:05:10.339> trying<00:05:10.789> to<00:05:10.939> tune

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
know what note you're trying to tune

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.029 
know what note you're trying to tune
because<00:05:11.839> if<00:05:11.990> your<00:05:12.110> string<00:05:12.289> is<00:05:12.319> really<00:05:12.559> flat<00:05:12.830> it

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 
because if your string is really flat it

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:14.860 
because if your string is really flat it
might<00:05:13.249> be<00:05:13.490> a<00:05:13.520> different<00:05:14.029> note<00:05:14.180> completely

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
might be a different note completely

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.559 
might be a different note completely
like<00:05:15.409> our<00:05:15.559> a<00:05:15.710> string<00:05:15.770> if<00:05:16.520> it's<00:05:16.729> real<00:05:16.849> flat<00:05:17.089> it

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:17.569 
like our a string if it's real flat it

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:19.089 
like our a string if it's real flat it
might<00:05:17.839> not<00:05:17.990> be<00:05:18.110> an<00:05:18.199> a<00:05:18.349> anymore<00:05:18.800> it<00:05:18.860> might<00:05:18.979> be

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:19.099 
might not be an a anymore it might be

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:21.399 
might not be an a anymore it might be
some<00:05:19.249> other<00:05:19.309> note<00:05:19.719> so<00:05:20.719> the<00:05:20.749> tuner<00:05:21.110> won't<00:05:21.259> know

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:21.409 
some other note so the tuner won't know

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:23.619 
some other note so the tuner won't know
what<00:05:21.559> you're<00:05:21.589> trying<00:05:21.889> to<00:05:21.949> do<00:05:22.099> it<00:05:22.219> first<00:05:22.460> so<00:05:23.330> I'm

00:05:23.619 --> 00:05:23.629 
what you're trying to do it first so I'm

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:25.450 
what you're trying to do it first so I'm
gonna<00:05:23.749> use<00:05:23.900> this<00:05:24.050> one<00:05:24.110> never<00:05:24.979> turn<00:05:25.249> on<00:05:25.309> the<00:05:25.430> a

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
gonna use this one never turn on the a

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:35.840 
gonna use this one never turn on the a
and<00:05:25.879> tune<00:05:26.419> the<00:05:26.539> a<00:05:26.569> string<00:05:26.900> up<00:05:27.020> till<00:05:27.349> it<00:05:27.680> matches

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:41.320 

yes<00:05:36.850> I<00:05:37.030> collect<00:05:37.330> the<00:05:37.480> whole<00:05:37.600> time<00:05:37.810> I<00:05:38.280> found<00:05:39.280> it

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
yes I collect the whole time I found it

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.700 
yes I collect the whole time I found it
then<00:05:42.330> I'm<00:05:42.659> gonna<00:05:42.750> pluck<00:05:43.050> both<00:05:43.229> strings<00:05:43.500> at

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
then I'm gonna pluck both strings at

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.890 
then I'm gonna pluck both strings at
once<00:05:43.830> the<00:05:44.280> a<00:05:44.310> and<00:05:44.639> the<00:05:44.729> B<00:05:44.759> and<00:05:45.539> now<00:05:45.599> I'm<00:05:45.719> showing

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
once the a and the B and now I'm showing

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.450 
once the a and the B and now I'm showing
you<00:05:46.080> how<00:05:46.169> to<00:05:46.199> dance<00:05:46.469> player<00:05:46.889> wouldn't<00:05:47.129> do<00:05:47.310> this

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
you how to dance player wouldn't do this

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.480 
you how to dance player wouldn't do this
it<00:05:47.969> might<00:05:48.120> be<00:05:48.180> a<00:05:48.210> little<00:05:48.300> hard<00:05:48.539> for<00:05:48.750> you<00:05:48.840> but

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
it might be a little hard for you but

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:54.679 
it might be a little hard for you but
I'm<00:05:50.490> gonna<00:05:50.610> plot<00:05:50.879> the<00:05:51.000> D<00:05:52.759> and<00:05:53.759> the<00:05:54.270> a<00:05:54.300> together

00:05:54.679 --> 00:05:54.689 
I'm gonna plot the D and the a together

00:05:54.689 --> 00:06:02.779 
I'm gonna plot the D and the a together
actually<00:06:00.409> I'm<00:06:01.409> gonna<00:06:01.560> do<00:06:01.710> the<00:06:01.830> g<00:06:02.039> string<00:06:02.430> and

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:02.789 
actually I'm gonna do the g string and

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:09.529 
actually I'm gonna do the g string and
then<00:06:02.969> pluck<00:06:03.150> it<00:06:03.389> with<00:06:03.599> the<00:06:03.750> D<00:06:03.900> string<00:06:08.539> I'm

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:09.539 
then pluck it with the D string I'm

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:15.769 
then pluck it with the D string I'm
gonna<00:06:09.719> bring<00:06:09.840> the<00:06:09.930> e<00:06:09.960> string<00:06:10.319> up<00:06:14.569> and<00:06:15.569> then<00:06:15.719> I'm

00:06:15.769 --> 00:06:15.779 
gonna bring the e string up and then I'm

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:16.999 
gonna bring the e string up and then I'm
gonna<00:06:15.900> check<00:06:16.050> the<00:06:16.139> a<00:06:16.169> string<00:06:16.469> is<00:06:16.620> probably

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:17.009 
gonna check the a string is probably

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:24.609 
gonna check the a string is probably
back<00:06:17.159> out<00:06:17.279> of<00:06:17.340> tune

00:06:24.609 --> 00:06:24.619 

00:06:24.619 --> 00:06:26.719 

and<00:06:25.619> sometimes<00:06:25.949> I<00:06:26.039> like<00:06:26.069> to<00:06:26.189> go<00:06:26.399> in<00:06:26.519> just<00:06:26.579> a

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:26.729 
and sometimes I like to go in just a

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:29.899 
and sometimes I like to go in just a
little<00:06:26.909> bit<00:06:27.029> past<00:06:27.179> the<00:06:27.449> pitch<00:06:28.669> like<00:06:29.669> batter

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:29.909 
little bit past the pitch like batter

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:37.309 
little bit past the pitch like batter
too<00:06:30.179> high<00:06:31.639> so<00:06:32.639> I'm<00:06:32.699> gonna<00:06:32.789> go<00:06:32.939> down<00:06:36.319> it's

now I'm gonna do this the violin is
tuned<00:07:08.930> in<00:07:09.080> fifths<00:07:09.349> so<00:07:09.770> when<00:07:10.129> you<00:07:10.220> get<00:07:10.370> one

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:10.550 
tuned in fifths so when you get one

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:11.950 
tuned in fifths so when you get one
string<00:07:10.819> in<00:07:10.939> tune<00:07:10.970> which<00:07:11.270> is<00:07:11.389> usually<00:07:11.629> the<00:07:11.689> a<00:07:11.720> we

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:11.960 
string in tune which is usually the a we

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.399 
string in tune which is usually the a we
get<00:07:12.080> in<00:07:12.199> tune<00:07:12.379> first<00:07:12.680> then<00:07:13.280> you<00:07:13.370> can<00:07:13.400> pluck<00:07:14.409> the

00:07:15.399 --> 00:07:15.409 
get in tune first then you can pluck the

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:16.899 
get in tune first then you can pluck the
two<00:07:15.560> together<00:07:15.710> until<00:07:16.099> you<00:07:16.280> get<00:07:16.400> a<00:07:16.430> perfect<00:07:16.879> fit

00:07:16.899 --> 00:07:16.909 
two together until you get a perfect fit

00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:18.399 
two together until you get a perfect fit
now<00:07:17.389> you're<00:07:17.569> not<00:07:17.719> going<00:07:17.900> to<00:07:17.990> be<00:07:18.080> able<00:07:18.319> to

00:07:18.399 --> 00:07:18.409 
now you're not going to be able to

00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:19.809 
now you're not going to be able to
figure<00:07:18.560> that<00:07:18.650> out<00:07:18.949> right<00:07:18.979> first<00:07:19.550> as<00:07:19.789> a

00:07:19.809 --> 00:07:19.819 
figure that out right first as a

00:07:19.819 --> 00:07:21.399 
figure that out right first as a
beginner<00:07:20.150> you<00:07:20.449> probably<00:07:21.050> don't<00:07:21.229> know<00:07:21.289> what<00:07:21.319> a

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:21.409 
beginner you probably don't know what a

00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:23.469 
beginner you probably don't know what a
perfect<00:07:21.710> fifth<00:07:21.860> is<00:07:22.069> much<00:07:22.909> less<00:07:23.150> what<00:07:23.389> it

00:07:23.469 --> 00:07:23.479 
perfect fifth is much less what it

00:07:23.479 --> 00:07:24.730 
perfect fifth is much less what it
sounds<00:07:23.750> like<00:07:23.810> but<00:07:23.930> that's<00:07:24.199> how<00:07:24.439> I'm<00:07:24.590> gonna

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:24.740 
sounds like but that's how I'm gonna

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.300 
sounds like but that's how I'm gonna
tune<00:07:26.020> I'm<00:07:27.020> in<00:07:27.139> tune<00:07:27.319> this<00:07:27.409> D<00:07:27.650> string<00:07:27.979> with<00:07:28.189> the
