 Zooming and (3D) Ken Burns In Openshot 1.4.3 [Music: TeknoAXE - Walking with style] 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 The Ken Burns effect is named after a documentary filmmaker who has used it extensively. [Music: TeknoAXE - Walking with style] 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 In essence, it means that one zooms in photos. [Music: TeknoAXE - Walking with style] 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 In addition, if you divide the image into different layers and zoom into them differently, you get a great 3D impression [Music: TeknoAXE - Walking with style] 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 You open the layout properties. Right click -&gt; Properties -&gt; Layout [Music: TeknoAXE - Walking with style] 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 To achieve a moving zoom, only either the start or end settings are edited. If necessary, the position is also adjusted. [Music: TeknoAXE - Walking with style] 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 For a fixed zoom, you also have to adjust the other settings. [Music: TeknoAXE - Walking with style] 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 To create a 3D Ken Burns effect, the image must be split into layers. For this you can open the picture with gimp and choose the freehand selection tool. [Music: TeknoAXE - Walking with style] 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 The foreground is marked step by step to be able to cut it later. [Music: TeknoAXE - Walking with style] 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 Cut the foreground ... Menu -&gt; Edit -&gt; Cut [Music: TeknoAXE - Walking with style] 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 ... and paste as a new image. Menu -&gt; paste as -&gt; new image [Music: TeknoAXE - Walking with style] 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 Save as new image Menu -&gt; Save as [Music: TeknoAXE - Walking with style] 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 Now you have to fill the gap with some background. You can use any selection tool to copy existing clips. [Music: TeknoAXE - Walking with style] 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 You do not have to be too careful. In principle, it is sufficient if the edges are covered. [Music: TeknoAXE - Walking with style] 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 If you want to work with three levels, you have to save the average distance separately. [Music: TeknoAXE - Walking with style] 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 The whole thing is repeated for the background. [Music: TeknoAXE - Walking with style] 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 The frames are imported into openshot and dragged onto the tracks. The foreground belongs to the top and the background to the bottom. [Music: TeknoAXE - Walking with style] 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 To create a 3D effect, you have to zoom differently in the individual clips. Normally, it works best when the background moves the most. [Music: TeknoAXE - Walking with style]
