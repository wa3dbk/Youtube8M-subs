you fit it into the middle of you two
bowls<00:02:33.209> and<00:02:33.799> then<00:02:34.799> fold<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:35.940> over<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:37.190> fold<00:02:38.190> it

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
bowls and then fold it over and fold it

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.240 
bowls and then fold it over and fold it
over<00:02:38.579> again<00:02:38.910> so<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:40.019> covers<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.500> back<00:02:40.709> and

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
over again so it covers the back and

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.000 
over again so it covers the back and
trim<00:02:42.000> off<00:02:43.070> the<00:02:44.070> bit<00:02:44.250> that<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:44.430> don't<00:02:44.670> need<00:02:44.930> and

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
trim off the bit that you don't need and

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.740 
trim off the bit that you don't need and
then<00:02:47.010> this<00:02:47.190> bit<00:02:47.459> now<00:02:47.489> needs<00:02:47.970> glue<00:02:48.450> dots

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
then this bit now needs glue dots

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.570 
then this bit now needs glue dots
applying<00:02:49.260> to<00:02:50.040> that<00:02:50.220> part

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.940 

now<00:02:54.570> just<00:02:54.810> put<00:02:54.960> in<00:02:55.050> two<00:02:55.200> or<00:02:55.350> three<00:02:55.530> I'm<00:02:55.680> just<00:02:55.860> to

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
now just put in two or three I'm just to

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.760 
now just put in two or three I'm just to
make<00:02:56.100> sure<00:02:56.250> that<00:02:56.490> it<00:02:56.610> sticks<00:02:56.910> in<00:02:57.600> place<00:02:57.990> and

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
make sure that it sticks in place and

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.850 
make sure that it sticks in place and
there<00:02:59.640> we<00:02:59.760> have<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.000> center<00:03:00.630> part<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:01.770> the

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
there we have the center part to the

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:02.390 
there we have the center part to the
bowl

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
bowl

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.120

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.670 
now to put tails on the bowl you need to
fasten<00:03:05.370> two<00:03:05.760> pieces<00:03:06.300> together<00:03:06.480> and<00:03:06.960> put<00:03:07.530> glue

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
fasten two pieces together and put glue

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.160

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
to add the bowl at the top of the card

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.320 
to add the bowl at the top of the card
so<00:03:28.650> again<00:03:28.860> I've<00:03:28.980> put<00:03:29.190> a<00:03:29.220> few<00:03:29.340> blue<00:03:29.700> dots<00:03:29.970> on<00:03:30.210> the

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
back and I'm just going to press that in

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.950 
back and I'm just going to press that in
place<00:03:34.520> so<00:03:35.520> that<00:03:35.550> it<00:03:35.820> sticks<00:03:36.090> in<00:03:36.390> the<00:03:36.480> card<00:03:36.720> try

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:36.960 
place so that it sticks in the card try

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.290 
place so that it sticks in the card try
not<00:03:37.140> suppress<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.800> the<00:03:38.340> folds<00:03:38.760> down<00:03:38.940> because

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
not suppress the the folds down because

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.570 
not suppress the the folds down because
you<00:03:39.420> need<00:03:39.570> them<00:03:39.810> to<00:03:39.840> look<00:03:40.170> like<00:03:40.470> bowls<00:03:41.220> and

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
you need them to look like bowls and

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.020 
you need them to look like bowls and
that's<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.420> finished<00:03:43.350> ribbon<00:03:43.920> in<00:03:44.040> Bowl<00:03:44.280> now

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
that's the finished ribbon in Bowl now

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.000 
that's the finished ribbon in Bowl now
this<00:03:45.240> is<00:03:45.390> another<00:03:45.660> way<00:03:45.900> to<00:03:45.960> fold<00:03:46.350> a<00:03:46.530> card<00:03:46.770> this

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
this is another way to fold a card this

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.850 
this is another way to fold a card this
is<00:03:47.070> an<00:03:47.310> off-center<00:03:47.850> game<00:03:48.240> fold<00:03:48.660> and<00:03:49.110> I've<00:03:49.650> used

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
is an off-center game fold and I've used

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.040 
is an off-center game fold and I've used
exactly<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.460> same<00:03:50.580> papers<00:03:51.270> on<00:03:51.420> this<00:03:51.630> one<00:03:51.810> as<00:03:51.930> I

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
exactly the same papers on this one as I

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.290 
exactly the same papers on this one as I
did<00:03:52.230> for<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:52.530> other<00:03:52.680> card<00:03:53.040> I've<00:03:53.670> just<00:03:54.000> used

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
did for the other card I've just used

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.390 
did for the other card I've just used
them<00:03:54.450> in<00:03:54.510> a<00:03:54.600> different<00:03:54.810> way<00:03:55.080> we've<00:03:55.980> used<00:03:56.220> the

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
them in a different way we've used the

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.610 
them in a different way we've used the
stripy<00:03:56.700> panel<00:03:57.240> in<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.780> center<00:03:57.959> of<00:03:58.230> the<00:03:58.350> card

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
stripy panel in the center of the card

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.820 
stripy panel in the center of the card
and<00:03:58.980> I've<00:03:59.459> used<00:03:59.730> silver<00:04:00.239> to<00:04:01.140> matte<00:04:01.380> and<00:04:01.590> layer

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
and I've used silver to matte and layer

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.930 
and I've used silver to matte and layer
the<00:04:02.130> two<00:04:03.440> other<00:04:04.440> panels

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
the two other panels

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.630 
the two other panels
now<00:04:06.510> if<00:04:06.570> you<00:04:06.720> look<00:04:06.930> the<00:04:07.320> foam<00:04:07.590> tape<00:04:07.890> is<00:04:08.190> just<00:04:08.220> on

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
now if you look the foam tape is just on

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.000 
now if you look the foam tape is just on
one<00:04:08.940> side<00:04:09.300> of<00:04:09.330> the<00:04:09.660> card<00:04:09.930> and<00:04:10.260> that's<00:04:10.470> because

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
one side of the card and that's because

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.270 
one side of the card and that's because
this<00:04:11.760> needs<00:04:12.120> to<00:04:12.420> be<00:04:12.540> fitted<00:04:12.810> to<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:14.040> gatefold

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
this needs to be fitted to the gatefold

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.370 
this needs to be fitted to the gatefold
and<00:04:14.910> if<00:04:15.000> you<00:04:15.120> put<00:04:15.330> it<00:04:15.420> on<00:04:15.570> both<00:04:15.780> sides<00:04:15.840> I'll

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
and if you put it on both sides I'll

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.100 
and if you put it on both sides I'll
just<00:04:16.530> glue<00:04:16.709> your<00:04:16.980> gate<00:04:17.160> falls<00:04:17.519> closed<00:04:17.940> so<00:04:18.870> just

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:19.110 
just glue your gate falls closed so just

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:25.630 
just glue your gate falls closed so just
put<00:04:19.410> it<00:04:19.500> on<00:04:19.650> one<00:04:19.950> side<00:04:20.810> remove<00:04:21.810> you<00:04:21.959> back<00:04:22.170> in

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.540 

and<00:04:26.640> we're<00:04:26.760> now<00:04:26.880> going<00:04:27.180> to<00:04:27.270> fit<00:04:27.630> this<00:04:27.930> to<00:04:28.710> the

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
and we're now going to fit this to the

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.420 
and we're now going to fit this to the
gate<00:04:29.760> fold<00:04:30.090> in<00:04:30.750> the<00:04:31.230> position<00:04:31.710> that<00:04:31.920> you<00:04:32.130> want

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
gate fold in the position that you want

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.690 
gate fold in the position that you want
it<00:04:32.640> to<00:04:32.790> be<00:04:32.910> fitted<00:04:33.860> so<00:04:34.860> there<00:04:35.070> he<00:04:35.220> is<00:04:35.340> just

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
it to be fitted so there he is just

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
it to be fitted so there he is just
pressing<00:04:36.120> down<00:04:36.320> and<00:04:37.430> on<00:04:38.430> the<00:04:38.580> top<00:04:38.820> just<00:04:39.630> the

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
pressing down and on the top just the

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.840 
pressing down and on the top just the
same<00:04:39.930> as<00:04:40.110> we<00:04:40.290> made<00:04:40.470> the<00:04:40.740> other<00:04:40.860> bowl<00:04:41.190> we've<00:04:41.670> now

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
same as we made the other bowl we've now

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.910 
same as we made the other bowl we've now
