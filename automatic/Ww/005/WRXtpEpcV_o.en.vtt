00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
it but trust me once you take the memory

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.720 
it but trust me once you take the memory
card<00:00:31.150> out<00:00:31.390> of<00:00:31.720> the<00:00:31.960> side<00:00:32.200> right<00:00:32.439> here<00:00:32.710> and<00:00:32.980> put

card out of the side right here and put

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.450 
card out of the side right here and put
into<00:00:33.879> your<00:00:34.149> computer<00:00:34.649> it's<00:00:35.649> much<00:00:36.040> clearer

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
into your computer it's much clearer

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.380

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
you take that memory card out the

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.619 
you take that memory card out the
recording<00:00:42.340> is<00:00:42.489> clearer<00:00:42.820> than<00:00:43.210> what<00:00:43.510> the

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
recording is clearer than what the

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:46.979 
recording is clearer than what the

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
screen shows there's a nut up here that

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:52.400 
screen shows there's a nut up here that
you<00:00:47.199> can<00:00:47.320> loosen<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:50.520> it's<00:00:51.520> pretty<00:00:51.730> tight

you can loosen and it's pretty tight

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.200 
you can loosen and it's pretty tight
there<00:00:53.410> goes<00:00:53.620> and<00:00:54.280> you<00:00:54.370> can<00:00:54.520> you<00:00:54.820> can<00:00:54.969> move<00:00:55.120> the

there goes and you can you can move the

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.040 
there goes and you can you can move the
camera<00:00:55.420> around<00:00:55.510> like<00:00:55.899> that<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:58.480> is<00:00:58.719> attached

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
camera around like that it is attached

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.200 
camera around like that it is attached
up<00:00:59.260> here<00:00:59.410> with<00:00:59.530> a<00:00:59.559> suction<00:00:59.829> cup<00:01:00.039> and<00:01:00.850> you<00:01:01.059> can

up here with a suction cup and you can
uh<00:01:01.239> there's<00:01:01.690> a<00:01:01.750> like<00:01:02.289> a<00:01:02.320> plunger<00:01:02.859> an<00:01:03.010> arm<00:01:03.250> here

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
uh there's a like a plunger an arm here

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.670 
uh there's a like a plunger an arm here
you<00:01:04.059> can<00:01:04.210> loosen<00:01:04.390> that<00:01:04.600> you<00:01:05.170> can<00:01:05.350> turn<00:01:05.530> the

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
you can loosen that you can turn the

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.630 
you can loosen that you can turn the
camera<00:01:06.090> this<00:01:07.090> way<00:01:07.660> it<00:01:07.810> that<00:01:07.960> way<00:01:08.140> a<00:01:08.640> little

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
camera this way it that way a little

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.040 
camera this way it that way a little
stuck<00:01:09.910> there<00:01:10.120> because<00:01:10.390> it's<00:01:10.570> been<00:01:10.690> sit<00:01:10.960> in

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
stuck there because it's been sit in

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.860 
stuck there because it's been sit in
that<00:01:11.140> position<00:01:11.320> for<00:01:11.560> a<00:01:11.740> while<00:01:15.330> let's<00:01:16.330> see<00:01:16.480> of

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:16.870 
that position for a while let's see of

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.630 
that position for a while let's see of
course<00:01:17.170> there's<00:01:17.380> where<00:01:17.530> the<00:01:17.560> power<00:01:17.860> goes<00:01:18.400> in

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
course there's where the power goes in

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.930 
course there's where the power goes in
right<00:01:18.970> here<00:01:19.240> and<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:21.070> goes<00:01:21.100> down<00:01:21.430> to<00:01:21.640> a<00:01:21.670> car

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
right here and it goes down to a car

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.550 
right here and it goes down to a car
charger<00:01:22.180> that<00:01:22.540> I've<00:01:22.660> got<00:01:22.840> mounted<00:01:23.170> here<00:01:23.350> which

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
charger that I've got mounted here which

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.550 
charger that I've got mounted here which
this<00:01:24.130> is<00:01:24.280> a<00:01:24.310> multiple<00:01:24.760> car<00:01:25.060> charger<00:01:25.560> could

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
this is a multiple car charger could

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.550 
this is a multiple car charger could
cause<00:01:26.800> I<00:01:26.920> have<00:01:27.070> more<00:01:27.250> than<00:01:27.370> one<00:01:27.550> device<00:01:27.700> and<00:01:28.560> it

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
cause I have more than one device and it

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.930 
cause I have more than one device and it
goes<00:01:29.800> down<00:01:29.950> to<00:01:30.010> the<00:01:30.250> main<00:01:30.550> one<00:01:32.970> down<00:01:33.970> here<00:01:34.210> and

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
goes down to the main one down here and

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.740 
goes down to the main one down here and
if<00:01:36.940> there<00:01:37.210> were<00:01:37.420> a<00:01:38.790> for<00:01:39.790> an<00:01:40.000> event<00:01:40.390> to<00:01:40.570> happen

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
if there were a for an event to happen

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.570 
if there were a for an event to happen
what<00:01:41.470> I<00:01:41.610> do<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:43.780> save<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:44.170> video<00:01:44.440> you<00:01:45.100> can<00:01:45.250> open

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
what I do to save the video you can open

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.340 
what I do to save the video you can open
this<00:01:45.700> up<00:01:45.760> and<00:01:46.830> actually<00:01:47.830> save<00:01:48.250> the<00:01:48.430> video

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
this up and actually save the video

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.780 
this up and actually save the video
manually<00:01:50.350> but<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:51.160> quickest<00:01:51.550> and<00:01:51.730> easiest

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
manually but the quickest and easiest

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.370 
manually but the quickest and easiest
way<00:01:52.060> to<00:01:52.210> say<00:01:52.450> the<00:01:52.600> video<00:01:52.870> is<00:01:53.200> simply<00:01:53.890> to<00:01:55.380> pull

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
way to say the video is simply to pull

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.940 
way to say the video is simply to pull
the<00:01:56.500> charger<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:58.090> automatically<00:01:58.840> saves<00:01:59.080> any

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
the charger it automatically saves any

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.890 
the charger it automatically saves any
video<00:02:00.310> that<00:02:00.370> you're<00:02:00.970> recording<00:02:01.240> at<00:02:01.510> that<00:02:01.660> time

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
video that you're recording at that time

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.250 
video that you're recording at that time
and<00:02:02.170> as<00:02:03.070> you<00:02:03.220> can<00:02:03.340> see<00:02:03.370> it's<00:02:03.780> it's<00:02:04.780> off<00:02:05.020> right

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
and as you can see it's it's off right

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.040 
and as you can see it's it's off right
now<00:02:05.410> I'll<00:02:06.070> plug<00:02:06.370> it<00:02:06.490> back<00:02:06.610> in<00:02:06.880> and<00:02:07.150> you<00:02:07.720> can<00:02:07.870> see

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
now I'll plug it back in and you can see

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.389 
now I'll plug it back in and you can see
it<00:02:08.170> start<00:02:08.410> up

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
it start up

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.740 
it start up
it<00:02:10.399> shows<00:02:10.550> a<00:02:10.580> couple<00:02:10.849> of<00:02:10.909> motorcycles<00:02:11.480> I<00:02:11.569> don't

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
it shows a couple of motorcycles I don't

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.110 
it shows a couple of motorcycles I don't
know<00:02:11.870> why<00:02:12.050> but<00:02:12.790> then<00:02:13.790> it<00:02:13.879> starts

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
know why but then it starts

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.600 
know why but then it starts
automatically<00:02:14.599> recording<00:02:15.080> again<00:02:15.549> I'll<00:02:16.549> have

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
automatically recording again I'll have

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:23.610 
automatically recording again I'll have
a<00:02:16.959> better<00:02:17.959> review<00:02:18.909> of<00:02:20.409> the<00:02:21.409> functions<00:02:21.920> of<00:02:22.040> this

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
a better review of the functions of this
