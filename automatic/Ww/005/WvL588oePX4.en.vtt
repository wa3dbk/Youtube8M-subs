00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
of time but these are super easy all I

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.200 
of time but these are super easy all I
did<00:01:31.770> was<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:32.040> little<00:01:32.310> square<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.610> white<00:01:32.939> fondant

and I rolled out a thin strip of
different<00:01:35.369> colors<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.030> then<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.630> write<00:01:36.930> on

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
different colors and then I write on

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.440 
different colors and then I write on
them<00:01:37.350> with<00:01:37.920> different<00:01:38.130> book<00:01:38.640> titles<00:01:39.090> on<00:01:39.330> the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
them with different book titles on the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.390 
them with different book titles on the
front<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.409> can<00:01:40.560> do<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.740> on<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.979> side<00:01:41.220> as

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
front and you can do it on the side as

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.100 
front and you can do it on the side as
well<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.850> I'm<00:01:42.180> going<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.330> let<00:01:42.479> those<00:01:42.630> dry<00:01:42.869> as

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
well and I'm going to let those dry as

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.710 
well and I'm going to let those dry as
well<00:01:43.290> now<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.549> only<00:01:44.700> other<00:01:45.000> piece<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.479> let

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
well now the only other piece that I let

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.210 
well now the only other piece that I let
dry<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.170> this<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.380> optional<00:01:46.560> but<00:01:46.830> I<00:01:46.979> think<00:01:47.159> it

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
dry and this is optional but I think it

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.980 
dry and this is optional but I think it
kind<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.400> adds<00:01:47.580> to<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:48.030> Apple<00:01:48.450> effect<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:48.960> a

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
kind of adds to this Apple effect is a

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.450 
kind of adds to this Apple effect is a
stem<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:49.799> just<00:01:49.920> took<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.070> little<00:01:50.250> bit<00:01:50.400> of

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
stem and I just took a little bit of

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.819 
stem and I just took a little bit of
brown<00:01:51.060> fondant<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:52.200> want<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.439> roll<00:01:52.619> that

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
brown fondant and you want to roll that

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.399 
brown fondant and you want to roll that
thin<00:01:53.130> but<00:01:53.310> leave<00:01:53.460> one<00:01:53.729> end<00:01:53.939> thick<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.570> then

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
thin but leave one end thick and then

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.289 
thin but leave one end thick and then
you<00:01:55.560> can<00:01:55.710> take<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.250> side<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:57.119> little

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
you can take the side of a little

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.240 
you can take the side of a little
spatula<00:01:57.479> or<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.900> knife<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.409> then<00:01:58.829> just<00:01:58.950> kind<00:01:59.159> of

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.039 
spatula or a knife and then just kind of
give<00:01:59.400> like<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.579> little<00:01:59.820> X<00:02:00.030> on<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.420> top<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.960> give

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
give like a little X on the top to give

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.560 
give like a little X on the top to give

that the white of the Apple shows now
usually<00:02:22.700> I<00:02:22.910> would<00:02:23.030> swirl<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.570> icing<00:02:23.900> on<00:02:23.990> here

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
usually I would swirl the icing on here

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.860 
usually I would swirl the icing on here
but<00:02:25.100> I'm<00:02:25.190> going<00:02:25.340> to<00:02:25.400> start<00:02:25.730> an<00:02:25.940> outside<00:02:26.390> swirl

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870

but I'm going to start an outside swirl
just<00:02:27.830> to<00:02:27.890> make<00:02:28.010> sure<00:02:28.040> I'm<00:02:28.220> reaching<00:02:28.580> the<00:02:28.670> ends

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
just to make sure I'm reaching the ends

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.250 
just to make sure I'm reaching the ends
and<00:02:29.180> then<00:02:29.420> from<00:02:29.600> there<00:02:29.660> I'm<00:02:29.960> just<00:02:30.110> going<00:02:30.230> to

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
rounded I don't want a swirl effect to

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.790 
rounded I don't want a swirl effect to
it<00:02:37.640> so<00:02:38.030> we<00:02:38.120> have<00:02:38.240> a<00:02:38.270> nice<00:02:38.570> rounded<00:02:39.230> shape<00:02:39.530> for

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
it so we have a nice rounded shape for

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.800 
it so we have a nice rounded shape for
our<00:02:39.830> apple<00:02:40.310> and<00:02:40.520> I<00:02:40.910> need<00:02:41.090> to<00:02:41.180> coat<00:02:41.420> it<00:02:41.450> in<00:02:41.660> the

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
our apple and I need to coat it in the

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.690 
our apple and I need to coat it in the
red<00:02:41.990> now<00:02:42.200> so<00:02:42.470> what<00:02:42.620> I've<00:02:42.710> got<00:02:42.890> here<00:02:42.920> is<00:02:43.220> a<00:02:43.310> blend

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
red now so what I've got here is a blend

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.270 
red now so what I've got here is a blend
of<00:02:44.030> sanding<00:02:44.600> sugar<00:02:44.870> and<00:02:45.110> sugar<00:02:45.260> crystals<00:02:45.800> the

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
of sanding sugar and sugar crystals the

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.530 
of sanding sugar and sugar crystals the
difference<00:02:46.610> in<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:46.730> two<00:02:46.940> is<00:02:47.000> the<00:02:47.180> sanding

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
difference in the two is the sanding

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.480 
difference in the two is the sanding
sugar<00:02:47.750> has<00:02:47.930> a<00:02:47.960> finer<00:02:48.350> grain<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:49.220> sugar

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
sugar has a finer grain the sugar

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.940 
sugar has a finer grain the sugar
crystals<00:02:49.940> has<00:02:50.090> a<00:02:50.120> larger<00:02:50.660> green<00:02:50.870> so<00:02:51.500> I<00:02:51.800> you

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
crystals has a larger green so I you

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.500
