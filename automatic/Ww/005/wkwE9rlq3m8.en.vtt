time<00:04:22.910> i<00:04:23.030> play<00:04:23.240> with<00:04:23.390> this<00:04:23.510> character<00:04:23.720> so<00:04:24.050> we'll

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
time i play with this character so we'll

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.070

around<00:04:28.550> us<00:04:28.940> halfway<00:04:29.360> done<00:04:30.130> so<00:04:31.130> maybe<00:04:31.880> we'll<00:04:32.180> do

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
around us halfway done so maybe we'll do

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.820 
around us halfway done so maybe we'll do
better<00:04:32.540> if<00:04:32.750> we<00:04:32.840> can't<00:04:33.080> get<00:04:33.170> a<00:04:33.230> knock<00:04:33.440> down<00:04:33.470> here

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
better if we can't get a knock down here

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.580 
better if we can't get a knock down here
in<00:04:33.890> the<00:04:33.950> first<00:04:34.160> round<00:04:34.990> so<00:04:35.990> we<00:04:36.020> get<00:04:36.200> my<00:04:36.350> butt

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590

kicked<00:04:36.620> here<00:04:37.220> I<00:04:37.910> don't<00:04:38.630> even<00:04:38.720> know<00:04:38.870> if<00:04:38.990> I'll

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
kicked here I don't even know if I'll

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.570 
kicked here I don't even know if I'll
make<00:04:39.290> it<00:04:39.350> to<00:04:39.590> the<00:04:39.710> second<00:04:40.040> round<00:04:40.070> by<00:04:40.370> the<00:04:40.400> way

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
so if I can hold out then things will be

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.310 
so if I can hold out then things will be
alright<00:04:48.880> luckily<00:04:49.880> I<00:04:49.970> do<00:04:50.120> so<00:04:50.660> the<00:04:50.930> first<00:04:51.200> round
