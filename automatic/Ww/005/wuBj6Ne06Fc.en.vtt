the power through drill is a critical

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.740 
the power through drill is a critical
drill<00:00:11.889> and<00:00:12.040> establish<00:00:12.700> the<00:00:12.910> fundamental

sources of power back to the core of the

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:17.730 
sources of power back to the core of the
body<00:00:16.510> see<00:00:16.780> a<00:00:16.810> lot<00:00:16.990> of<00:00:17.020> young<00:00:17.260> hitters<00:00:17.560> really

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
body see a lot of young hitters really

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.950 
body see a lot of young hitters really
use<00:00:17.950> their<00:00:18.100> arms<00:00:18.430> other<00:00:18.940> places<00:00:19.360> to<00:00:19.630> get<00:00:19.780> power

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960 
use their arms other places to get power

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.170 
use their arms other places to get power
really<00:00:20.289> the<00:00:20.410> source<00:00:20.680> of<00:00:20.860> power<00:00:21.039> comes<00:00:21.580> through

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.180 
really the source of power comes through

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.420 
really the source of power comes through
the<00:00:22.240> core<00:00:22.570> of<00:00:22.690> the<00:00:22.780> body<00:00:23.020> and<00:00:23.260> to<00:00:23.800> help<00:00:24.070> with

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.430 
the core of the body and to help with

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.970 
the core of the body and to help with
that<00:00:24.700> many<00:00:25.450> coaches<00:00:25.720> use<00:00:26.050> overload<00:00:26.500> training

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
that many coaches use overload training

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.580 
that many coaches use overload training
one<00:00:27.730> of<00:00:27.850> the<00:00:27.940> things<00:00:28.210> that<00:00:28.390> works<00:00:29.020> great<00:00:29.320> is

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590 
one of the things that works great is

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.700 
one of the things that works great is
the<00:00:30.190> skills<00:00:30.550> power<00:00:31.060> through<00:00:31.450> ball<00:00:31.660> and<00:00:31.930> also

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
the skills power through ball and also

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.670 
the skills power through ball and also
the<00:00:33.250> power<00:00:33.489> through<00:00:33.879> t-top<00:00:34.360> so<00:00:34.899> the<00:00:35.050> t-top<00:00:35.440> is

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
the power through t-top so the t-top is

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.220 
the power through t-top so the t-top is
designed<00:00:36.190> to<00:00:36.879> really<00:00:37.090> hold<00:00:37.390> any<00:00:37.600> ball<00:00:37.840> you<00:00:38.079> can

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
designed to really hold any ball you can

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.259 
designed to really hold any ball you can
take<00:00:38.379> a<00:00:38.410> partially<00:00:38.980> deflated<00:00:39.280> basketball<00:00:40.089> or

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:40.269 
take a partially deflated basketball or

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:43.020 
take a partially deflated basketball or
volleyball<00:00:40.300> and<00:00:40.960> this<00:00:41.379> t-top<00:00:41.769> is<00:00:42.070> reinforced

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
volleyball and this t-top is reinforced

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.489 
volleyball and this t-top is reinforced
so<00:00:43.149> that<00:00:43.300> it'll<00:00:43.449> hold<00:00:43.629> that<00:00:43.870> it's<00:00:44.019> got<00:00:44.170> a<00:00:44.199> wider

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:44.499 
so that it'll hold that it's got a wider

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:46.860 
so that it'll hold that it's got a wider
diameter<00:00:44.769> it<00:00:45.370> will<00:00:45.579> hold<00:00:45.760> virtually<00:00:46.359> any<00:00:46.539> ball

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
diameter it will hold virtually any ball

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.049 
diameter it will hold virtually any ball
so<00:00:47.530> you<00:00:48.010> just<00:00:48.190> replace<00:00:48.999> it<00:00:49.269> one<00:00:50.079> of<00:00:50.170> the<00:00:50.230> t-tops

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
so you just replace it one of the t-tops

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.529 
so you just replace it one of the t-tops
put<00:00:52.059> it<00:00:52.149> in<00:00:52.210> one<00:00:52.390> of<00:00:52.449> the<00:00:52.539> slots<00:00:52.839> and<00:00:54.539> we're

00:00:55.529 --> 00:00:55.539 
put it in one of the slots and we're

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:57.660 
put it in one of the slots and we're
ready<00:00:55.749> to<00:00:55.839> go<00:00:56.079> you<00:00:56.710> what<00:00:56.859> you'll<00:00:57.100> see<00:00:57.399> in<00:00:57.519> this

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
ready to go you what you'll see in this

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.860 
ready to go you what you'll see in this
is<00:00:57.879> you<00:00:57.969> try<00:00:58.179> to<00:00:58.239> get<00:00:58.510> the<00:00:58.659> hitter<00:00:58.989> to<00:00:59.850> increase

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
is you try to get the hitter to increase

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.660 
is you try to get the hitter to increase
the<00:01:01.870> sources<00:01:02.409> of<00:01:02.440> power<00:01:02.800> where<00:01:03.339> they<00:01:03.460> get

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
the sources of power where they get

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.250 
the sources of power where they get
their<00:01:03.819> strength<00:01:04.180> from<00:01:04.360> so<00:01:04.659> you'll<00:01:04.809> see<00:01:04.960> a<00:01:04.989> hit

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
their strength from so you'll see a hit

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.380 
their strength from so you'll see a hit
or<00:01:05.379> naturally<00:01:06.070> start<00:01:06.340> to<00:01:06.550> gather<00:01:06.790> power<00:01:07.150> in

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
or naturally start to gather power in

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.330 
or naturally start to gather power in
their<00:01:07.540> legs<00:01:07.840> and<00:01:08.080> their<00:01:08.170> torso<00:01:08.740> in<00:01:08.890> their<00:01:09.010> core

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
their legs and their torso in their core

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.370 
their legs and their torso in their core
to<00:01:09.880> get<00:01:10.030> the<00:01:10.150> necessary<00:01:10.300> power<00:01:10.840> to<00:01:11.079> really

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
to get the necessary power to really

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.620 
to get the necessary power to really
drive<00:01:11.829> through<00:01:12.490> this<00:01:12.759> ball<00:01:13.030> so<00:01:13.270> you<00:01:13.299> want<00:01:13.570> that

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
drive through this ball so you want that

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.170 
drive through this ball so you want that
hitter<00:01:13.960> to<00:01:14.049> to<00:01:14.770> not<00:01:14.920> hit<00:01:15.219> the<00:01:15.369> ball<00:01:15.399> and<00:01:15.759> recoil

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
hitter to to not hit the ball and recoil

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.450 
hitter to to not hit the ball and recoil
back<00:01:16.479> you<00:01:16.930> want<00:01:17.079> to<00:01:17.229> really<00:01:17.409> finish<00:01:17.829> strong

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
back you want to really finish strong

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.420 
back you want to really finish strong
through<00:01:19.090> the<00:01:19.119> ball<00:01:19.540> if<00:01:19.810> you're<00:01:20.500> in<00:01:20.740> a<00:01:21.100> short

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
through the ball if you're in a short

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.149 
through the ball if you're in a short
cage<00:01:21.729> this<00:01:22.240> works<00:01:22.479> okay<00:01:22.899> also<00:01:23.350> in<00:01:23.500> a<00:01:23.590> long<00:01:23.860> cage

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
cage this works okay also in a long cage

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.700 
cage this works okay also in a long cage
see<00:01:24.490> the<00:01:24.640> distance<00:01:25.180> that<00:01:25.780> a<00:01:25.840> player<00:01:26.200> can<00:01:26.229> hit

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
see the distance that a player can hit

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.380 
see the distance that a player can hit
this<00:01:26.920> fall<00:01:27.189> and<00:01:27.340> have<00:01:27.490> them<00:01:27.610> try<00:01:27.789> to<00:01:27.820> reach<00:01:28.119> out

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
this fall and have them try to reach out

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.380 
this fall and have them try to reach out
and<00:01:28.600> drive<00:01:29.170> it<00:01:29.320> in<00:01:29.439> a<00:01:29.530> further<00:01:30.310> distance<00:01:30.670> all

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
and drive it in a further distance all

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.230 
and drive it in a further distance all
right

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.850 

the<00:01:37.240> power<00:01:37.450> through<00:01:37.750> ball<00:01:37.960> is<00:01:38.200> it<00:01:38.350> has<00:01:38.470> a<00:01:38.500> great

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
the power through ball is it has a great

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.740 
the power through ball is it has a great
weight<00:01:39.130> to<00:01:39.340> it<00:01:39.490> it's<00:01:39.670> about<00:01:39.880> one<00:01:40.090> pound<00:01:40.330> so<00:01:40.630> it

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
weight to it it's about one pound so it

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.230 
weight to it it's about one pound so it
doesn't<00:01:41.050> provide<00:01:41.350> too<00:01:41.560> much<00:01:41.590> resistance<00:01:42.240> to

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
doesn't provide too much resistance to

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.450 
doesn't provide too much resistance to
injure<00:01:43.540> the<00:01:43.660> hitter<00:01:43.840> but<00:01:44.110> provides<00:01:44.500> a<00:01:44.770> real

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
injure the hitter but provides a real

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.610 
injure the hitter but provides a real
good<00:01:46.030> resistance<00:01:46.480> so<00:01:46.810> they<00:01:46.930> can<00:01:47.110> learn<00:01:47.350> how<00:01:47.380> to

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
good resistance so they can learn how to

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.890 
good resistance so they can learn how to
gather<00:01:48.010> that<00:01:48.370> source<00:01:49.000> of<00:01:49.210> power<00:01:49.420> from<00:01:49.690> their

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
gather that source of power from their

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.960 
gather that source of power from their
core<00:01:50.230> and<00:01:50.440> drive<00:01:51.130> the<00:01:51.340> ball<00:01:51.490> and<00:01:51.550> you'll<00:01:51.760> see

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
core and drive the ball and you'll see

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.760 
core and drive the ball and you'll see
the<00:01:52.090> bat<00:01:52.330> speed<00:01:52.570> increase<00:01:53.290> almost

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
the bat speed increase almost

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.400 
the bat speed increase almost
immediately<00:01:54.370> as<00:01:54.670> they<00:01:55.270> move<00:01:55.540> back<00:01:55.840> to<00:01:56.050> a<00:01:56.080> live

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
immediately as they move back to a live

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.350 
immediately as they move back to a live
ball<00:01:56.680> you<00:01:57.610> can<00:01:57.790> use<00:01:57.910> both<00:01:58.090> of<00:01:58.270> these

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
ball you can use both of these

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.750 
ball you can use both of these
components<00:01:58.810> to<00:01:59.500> promote<00:01:59.800> power<00:02:00.040> with<00:02:00.310> almost
