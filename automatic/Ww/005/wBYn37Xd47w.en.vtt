00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
left-hand side this is what we call your

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.580 
left-hand side this is what we call your
decreasing<00:00:20.699> wavelength<00:00:21.180> waves<00:00:21.510> what<00:00:22.410> do<00:00:22.470> you

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
decreasing wavelength waves what do you

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.859 
decreasing wavelength waves what do you

very<00:00:29.369> very<00:00:29.699> small<00:00:29.910> they<00:00:30.539> tend<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.810> be<00:00:30.900> very

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
very very small they tend to be very

very very small they tend to be very
squished<00:00:31.590> together<00:00:31.769> which<00:00:32.550> means<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:33.000> you

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
squished together which means that you

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.020 
squished together which means that you
tend<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.390> get<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.570> lot<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.110> waves<00:00:34.320> hit<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.460> per

tend to get a lot of waves hit you per

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.299 
tend to get a lot of waves hit you per
unit<00:00:36.450> time<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:37.380> whether<00:00:37.649> we're<00:00:37.800> measuring<00:00:38.160> how

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
unit time so whether we're measuring how

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.220 
unit time so whether we're measuring how
many<00:00:38.370> ways<00:00:38.670> are<00:00:38.850> going<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.030> hit<00:00:39.239> per<00:00:39.480> hour<00:00:39.750> per

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
many ways are going to hit per hour per

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.139 
many ways are going to hit per hour per
minute<00:00:40.590> per<00:00:40.770> second<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.670> tend<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.000> get

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
minute per second you tend to get

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.869 
minute per second you tend to get
bombarded<00:00:42.270> with<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.960> lot<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.469> waves<00:00:43.800> in<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.579> very

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
bombarded with a lot of waves in a very

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.090 
bombarded with a lot of waves in a very
short<00:00:45.090> period<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.510> time<00:00:45.570> these<00:00:46.469> waves<00:00:46.770> tend<00:00:46.980> to

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
short period of time these waves tend to

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.040 
short period of time these waves tend to
be<00:00:47.190> very<00:00:47.370> high-energy<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.690> tend<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:48.960> get

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
be very high-energy you tend to get

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.900 
be very high-energy you tend to get
what's<00:00:49.260> called<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.530> high<00:00:49.710> frequency<00:00:50.100> which

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
what's called a high frequency which

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.000 
what's called a high frequency which
means<00:00:51.180> they<00:00:51.300> come<00:00:51.539> about<00:00:51.809> much<00:00:52.140> more<00:00:52.410> frequent

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
means they come about much more frequent

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.400 
means they come about much more frequent
than<00:00:53.520> say<00:00:53.969> you're<00:00:54.210> increased<00:00:54.780> wavelength

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
than say you're increased wavelength

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.220 
than say you're increased wavelength
waves<00:00:55.760> so<00:00:56.760> your<00:00:56.940> gamma<00:00:57.180> rays<00:00:57.449> your<00:00:57.690> x-rays<00:00:58.140> you

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
waves so your gamma rays your x-rays you

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.869 
waves so your gamma rays your x-rays you
ultraviolet<00:00:58.649> they're<00:00:58.949> very<00:00:59.309> dangerous

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
ultraviolet they're very dangerous

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.939 
ultraviolet they're very dangerous
most<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.809> these<00:01:00.899> are<00:01:01.109> absorbed<00:01:01.469> by<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.590> upper

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
most of these are absorbed by the upper

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.060 
most of these are absorbed by the upper
atmosphere<00:01:02.070> or<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:03.049> ozone<00:01:04.049> layer<00:01:04.229> we<00:01:04.830> know

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
atmosphere or the ozone layer we know

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.310 
atmosphere or the ozone layer we know
that<00:01:05.309> some<00:01:05.519> ultraviolet<00:01:05.970> rays<00:01:06.299> do<00:01:06.780> hit<00:01:07.110> us

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
that some ultraviolet rays do hit us

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.140 
that some ultraviolet rays do hit us
here<00:01:08.040> on<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.250> surface<00:01:08.549> because<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.909> tend<00:01:09.119> to

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
here on the surface because you tend to

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.969 
here on the surface because you tend to
get<00:01:09.270> tan<00:01:09.540> or<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.930> tend<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.140> get<00:01:10.260> sunburn<00:01:10.770> if

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
get tan or you tend to get sunburn if

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.740 
get tan or you tend to get sunburn if
you<00:01:11.400> get<00:01:11.549> exposed<00:01:11.939> for<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.180> long<00:01:12.330> period<00:01:12.720> of

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
you get exposed for a long period of

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.890 
you get exposed for a long period of
time<00:01:13.280> the<00:01:14.280> right<00:01:14.490> side<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.119> chart<00:01:15.630> is

time the right side of the chart is
going<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.170> be<00:01:16.259> you're<00:01:16.380> increasing<00:01:16.770> wavelength

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
going to be you're increasing wavelength

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.460 
going to be you're increasing wavelength
you're<00:01:18.060> increasing<00:01:18.479> wavelengths<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.350> can

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
you're increasing wavelengths you can

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.070 
you're increasing wavelengths you can
represent<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:20.100> by<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:21.000> distance<00:01:21.420> between<00:01:21.630> one

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
represent it by the distance between one

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.440 
represent it by the distance between one
wave<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.590> next<00:01:22.890> can<00:01:23.070> be<00:01:23.159> much<00:01:23.400> bigger<00:01:23.729> so

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
wave to the next can be much bigger so

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.719 
wave to the next can be much bigger so
you<00:01:24.509> don't<00:01:24.960> get<00:01:25.140> as<00:01:25.290> many<00:01:25.439> waves<00:01:25.770> they<00:01:26.460> tend<00:01:26.670> to

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
you don't get as many waves they tend to

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.910 
you don't get as many waves they tend to
be<00:01:26.850> much<00:01:27.270> less<00:01:27.570> frequent<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.290> not<00:01:28.710> as

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
be much less frequent and not as

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.770 
be much less frequent and not as
high-energy<00:01:29.369> so<00:01:29.790> they're<00:01:29.909> not<00:01:30.090> as<00:01:30.329> dangerous

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
high-energy so they're not as dangerous

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.569 
high-energy so they're not as dangerous

green yellow orange and red okay your

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.709 
green yellow orange and red okay your
violet<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:59.040> considered<00:01:59.790> short<00:02:00.180> wavelength

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
violet is considered short wavelength

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.889 
violet is considered short wavelength
gate<00:02:01.619> your<00:02:01.860> red<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.509> categorized<00:02:03.509> as<00:02:03.750> an

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
gate your red is categorized as an

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.990 
gate your red is categorized as an
increased<00:02:04.469> wavelength<00:02:05.070> it's<00:02:05.790> not

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
increased wavelength it's not

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.330 
increased wavelength it's not
coincidental<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.689> violet<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:07.500> right<00:02:08.009> next

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
coincidental that violet is right next

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.609 
coincidental that violet is right next
to<00:02:08.550> ultraviolet<00:02:09.239> in<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:10.289> electromagnetic

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
to ultraviolet in the electromagnetic

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.450 
to ultraviolet in the electromagnetic
spectrum<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.489> red<00:02:12.209> is<00:02:12.510> right<00:02:12.840> next<00:02:12.989> to

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
spectrum and red is right next to

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.030 
spectrum and red is right next to
infrared<00:02:14.000> so<00:02:14.810> that's<00:02:14.930> it<00:02:15.110> for<00:02:15.230> about<00:02:15.350> now<00:02:15.650> good

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
infrared so that's it for about now good

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.220 
infrared so that's it for about now good
luck
