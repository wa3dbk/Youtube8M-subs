cynical view of the world despite the

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.110 
cynical view of the world despite the
fact<00:00:34.350> that<00:00:34.500> he<00:00:34.770> was<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.280> fact<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.670> pretty<00:00:35.969> good

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
fact that he was in fact a pretty good

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.790 
fact that he was in fact a pretty good
guy<00:00:36.270> he<00:00:36.630> just<00:00:36.809> seems<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.050> much<00:00:37.200> murder<00:00:37.469> and

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
guy he just seems so much murder and

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.040 
guy he just seems so much murder and
death<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.219> horrible<00:00:38.610> stuff<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:39.270> he<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.750> sort

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
death and horrible stuff that he it sort

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.750 
death and horrible stuff that he it sort
of<00:00:40.079> affected<00:00:40.500> his<00:00:40.620> worldview<00:00:40.890> or<00:00:41.219> her

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
of affected his worldview or her

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.160 
of affected his worldview or her
worldview<00:00:42.149> technically<00:00:42.660> but<00:00:42.780> I<00:00:42.840> think<00:00:43.020> back

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
worldview technically but I think back

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.840 
worldview technically but I think back
in<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.350> day<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.590> was<00:00:43.649> mostly<00:00:44.100> centered<00:00:44.309> on<00:00:44.700> men

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
in the day it was mostly centered on men

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.340 
in the day it was mostly centered on men
so<00:00:45.090> no<00:00:45.180> art<00:00:45.329> fiction<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:45.780> actually<00:00:46.110> kind<00:00:46.320> of

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
so no art fiction is actually kind of

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.350 
so no art fiction is actually kind of
the<00:00:46.410> next<00:00:46.680> step<00:00:46.829> in<00:00:47.250> hard-boiled<00:00:48.149> crime

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
the next step in hard-boiled crime

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.930 
the next step in hard-boiled crime
literature<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.559> key<00:00:49.890> characteristic<00:00:50.700> being

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
literature the key characteristic being

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.180 
literature the key characteristic being
the<00:00:51.210> protagonist<00:00:51.559> doesn't<00:00:52.559> have<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:53.010> be<00:00:53.160> a

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
the protagonist doesn't have to be a

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.680 
the protagonist doesn't have to be a
good<00:00:53.430> guy<00:00:53.640> they<00:00:54.239> can<00:00:54.360> have<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.510> lot<00:00:54.660> of

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
good guy they can have a lot of

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.090 
good guy they can have a lot of
characteristics<00:00:55.379> about<00:00:55.500> them<00:00:55.770> which<00:00:55.920> could

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
characteristics about them which could

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.160 
characteristics about them which could
be<00:00:56.219> somewhat<00:00:56.610> unsavory<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.690> they<00:00:57.780> can<00:00:57.930> kind<00:00:58.050> of

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
be somewhat unsavory so they can kind of

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.680 
be somewhat unsavory so they can kind of
be<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.859> coining<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.309> an<00:00:59.399> antihero<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:00.570> it's

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
be the coining of an antihero so it's
