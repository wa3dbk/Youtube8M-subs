it<00:00:00.870> is<00:00:01.050> my<00:00:01.260> experience<00:00:01.860> that<00:00:02.340> artists<00:00:03.240> that

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
it is my experience that artists that

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.260 
it is my experience that artists that
achieve<00:00:03.780> the<00:00:04.020> most<00:00:04.290> profound<00:00:05.270> emotional

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
achieve the most profound emotional

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.950 
achieve the most profound emotional
effects<00:00:06.720> in<00:00:07.049> their<00:00:07.589> work<00:00:07.890> do<00:00:08.730> so<00:00:09.090> through<00:00:09.929> a

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
effects in their work do so through a

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.669 
effects in their work do so through a
total<00:00:10.440> immersion<00:00:11.099> in<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.059> technical<00:00:12.900> aspects

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
total immersion in the technical aspects

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.820 
total immersion in the technical aspects
of<00:00:13.830> their<00:00:14.340> art<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:15.289> found<00:00:16.289> this<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.680> be

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
of their art I found this to be

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.980 
of their art I found this to be
particularly<00:00:17.369> true<00:00:17.970> in<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.660> art<00:00:18.840> of

at the Rosenfeld gallery I got to ask
her<00:00:25.019> about<00:00:25.230> her<00:00:25.500> technique<00:00:27.740> stannic<00:00:28.740> sculptor

to the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts
here<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.140> Philadelphia<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:34.890> work<00:00:35.460> primarily<00:00:36.300> in

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
here in Philadelphia I work primarily in

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.110 
here in Philadelphia I work primarily in
concrete<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.980> say<00:00:38.160> primarily<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:38.910> have<00:00:39.090> a

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
concrete and I say primarily I have a

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.389 
concrete and I say primarily I have a
lot<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.480> Steel<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:39.989> there<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.170> use<00:00:40.500> materials

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
lot of Steel in there I use materials

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.299 
lot of Steel in there I use materials
mixed<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.149> my<00:00:42.360> cement<00:00:42.690> mixtures<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.379> involve

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
mixed in my cement mixtures that involve

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.479 
mixed in my cement mixtures that involve
a<00:00:44.610> number<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.030> different<00:00:45.300> varieties

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.010 

well<00:00:50.489> it's<00:00:50.670> cement<00:00:51.000> before<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.570> cures<00:00:51.780> and

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
well it's cement before it cures and

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.330 
well it's cement before it cures and
once<00:00:52.140> it's<00:00:52.260> cured<00:00:52.410> it's<00:00:52.590> hungry<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.190> you'll

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
once it's cured it's hungry so you'll

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.430 
once it's cured it's hungry so you'll
hear<00:00:53.489> me<00:00:53.579> use<00:00:53.610> those<00:00:54.000> terms<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.480> way<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:54.899> got

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
hear me use those terms that way I got

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.130 
hear me use those terms that way I got
involved<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:55.890> working<00:00:56.190> with<00:00:56.340> cement<00:00:57.120> first<00:00:57.719> as

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
involved in working with cement first as

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.410 
involved in working with cement first as
creating<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.070> pedestal<00:00:59.370> for<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.910> bronze<00:01:00.180> piece

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
creating a pedestal for a bronze piece

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.009 
creating a pedestal for a bronze piece
and<00:01:00.890> when<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:01.920> started<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.699> manipulate<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.840> I

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
and when I started to manipulate it I

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.929 
and when I started to manipulate it I
realized<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.710> had<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.860> lot<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.220> flexibility<00:01:05.790> and

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
realized it had a lot of flexibility and

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.520 
realized it had a lot of flexibility and
it<00:01:06.060> was<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.390> lot<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.840> characteristics<00:01:07.439> of

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
it was a lot of the characteristics of

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.929 
it was a lot of the characteristics of
the<00:01:07.650> plaster<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.250> was<00:01:08.430> already<00:01:08.700> familiar

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
the plaster that I was already familiar

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.600 
the plaster that I was already familiar
with<00:01:12.350> and<00:01:13.350> then<00:01:13.590> as<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:13.950> got<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.189> know<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.520> even

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
with and then as I got to know it even

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.249 
with and then as I got to know it even
more<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.270> realized<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:15.900> was<00:01:16.020> even<00:01:16.229> more

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
more I realized it was even more

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.980 
more I realized it was even more
versatile<00:01:16.770> than<00:01:16.830> plaster<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.750> even<00:01:18.750> than<00:01:18.900> the

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
versatile than plaster and even than the

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.660 
versatile than plaster and even than the
bronze<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.470> was<00:01:19.650> working<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:20.100> yet<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.430> can

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
bronze that I was working in yet I can

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.340 
bronze that I was working in yet I can
get<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.000> bronze<00:01:21.299> effects<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:21.990> plaster

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
get the bronze effects and the plaster

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.530 
get the bronze effects and the plaster
effects<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.890> stone<00:01:23.130> effects<00:01:23.430> with<00:01:23.790> with<00:01:24.420> the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
effects and stone effects with with the

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.450 
effects and stone effects with with the
concrete<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.080> just<00:01:25.259> started<00:01:25.530> digging<00:01:26.310> into

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
concrete so I just started digging into

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.730 
concrete so I just started digging into
it<00:01:26.640> further<00:01:26.850> studying<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.020> researching<00:01:28.409> and

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
it further studying and researching and

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.590 
it further studying and researching and
reading<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.340> trying<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.700> understand<00:01:30.540> the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
reading and trying to understand the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.899 
reading and trying to understand the
material<00:01:31.020> till<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.259> finally<00:01:32.070> got<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.520> point

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
material till I finally got to a point

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.550 
material till I finally got to a point
where<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.119> was<00:01:33.270> developing<00:01:33.479> my<00:01:33.840> own<00:01:33.869> formulas

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
where I was developing my own formulas

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.219 
where I was developing my own formulas
and<00:01:34.829> my<00:01:34.950> own<00:01:35.100> mixtures<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.299> created<00:01:37.140> the

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
and my own mixtures that created the

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.020 
and my own mixtures that created the
effects<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.650> was<00:01:37.770> going<00:01:38.009> for

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
effects I was going for

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.630 
effects I was going for
a<00:01:41.570> lot<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.600> what<00:01:42.870> you'll<00:01:42.990> see<00:01:43.260> is<00:01:43.560> all<00:01:44.400> my

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
a lot of what you'll see is all my

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.490 
a lot of what you'll see is all my
custom<00:01:45.060> formulas<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.750> colors<00:01:46.110> they're<00:01:46.350> not

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
custom formulas and colors they're not

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.440 
custom formulas and colors they're not
painted<00:01:46.950> surfaces<00:01:47.430> it's<00:01:47.670> integral<00:01:48.210> color

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
painted surfaces it's integral color

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.290 
painted surfaces it's integral color
that's<00:01:49.380> mixed<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.250> various<00:01:50.850> layers<00:01:51.030> of

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
that's mixed in the various layers of

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.930 
that's mixed in the various layers of
the<00:01:51.390> concrete<00:01:51.870> some<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.830> them<00:01:52.950> are<00:01:53.160> modeled

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
the concrete some of them are modeled

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.900 
the concrete some of them are modeled
directly<00:01:54.330> so<00:01:54.720> I'll<00:01:55.250> switch<00:01:56.250> my<00:01:56.280> colors<00:01:56.880> my

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
directly so I'll switch my colors my

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.060 
directly so I'll switch my colors my
formulas<00:01:57.600> as<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:57.869> progress<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.740> surface

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
formulas as I progress to the surface

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.950 
formulas as I progress to the surface
layer<00:01:59.250> so<00:01:59.520> that's<00:01:59.760> why<00:01:59.880> you'll<00:02:00.030> see<00:02:00.119> the

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
layer so that's why you'll see the

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.899 
layer so that's why you'll see the
changing<00:02:01.350> colors<00:02:01.619> throughout

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.840 

some<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.750> them<00:02:06.869> are<00:02:07.080> cast<00:02:08.009> from<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.280> mold<00:02:08.520> and

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
some of them are cast from a mold and

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.699 
some of them are cast from a mold and
while<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.780> original<00:02:09.869> piece<00:02:10.259> might<00:02:10.440> have<00:02:10.560> been

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
while the original piece might have been

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.220 
while the original piece might have been
modeled<00:02:11.310> in<00:02:11.490> plaster<00:02:12.180> or<00:02:12.360> clay<00:02:12.569> or<00:02:12.870> some<00:02:13.080> other

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.900 
modeled in plaster or clay or some other
material<00:02:13.410> I'll<00:02:13.980> do<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.220> mold<00:02:14.459> and<00:02:14.670> then<00:02:14.760> I'll

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
material I'll do a mold and then I'll

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.960 
material I'll do a mold and then I'll
cast<00:02:15.420> it<00:02:15.660> with<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:16.350> cement<00:02:17.190> mixture<00:02:17.459> that<00:02:17.790> has

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
cast it with the cement mixture that has

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.670 
cast it with the cement mixture that has
the<00:02:18.330> pigments<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.959> aggregates<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:19.560> all

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
the pigments and the aggregates and all

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.680 
the pigments and the aggregates and all
that

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690

the<00:02:25.200> cement<00:02:25.560> mixture<00:02:25.890> actually<00:02:26.640> has<00:02:26.880> a<00:02:27.180> life

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
the cement mixture actually has a life

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.110 
the cement mixture actually has a life
of<00:02:27.630> its<00:02:27.750> own<00:02:27.990> it<00:02:28.560> starts<00:02:29.100> off<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.670> know<00:02:29.970> the

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
of its own it starts off you know the

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.480 
of its own it starts off you know the
slump<00:02:30.570> is<00:02:31.080> that<00:02:31.440> you<00:02:31.560> see<00:02:31.770> pour<00:02:32.070> it<00:02:32.160> into<00:02:32.280> the

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
slump is that you see pour it into the

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.310 
slump is that you see pour it into the
sidewalks<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:33.270> that's<00:02:33.720> great<00:02:33.960> when<00:02:34.200> you're

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
sidewalks and that's great when you're

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.140 
sidewalks and that's great when you're
slushing<00:02:34.770> and<00:02:34.920> pouring<00:02:35.370> a<00:02:35.430> mold<00:02:35.640> but<00:02:35.880> then<00:02:36.000> it

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
slushing and pouring a mold but then it

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.110 
slushing and pouring a mold but then it
takes<00:02:36.450> on<00:02:36.690> another<00:02:37.440> form<00:02:37.890> as<00:02:38.220> it<00:02:38.430> starts<00:02:38.970> to

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
takes on another form as it starts to

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.900 
takes on another form as it starts to
cure<00:02:39.450> it<00:02:40.050> gets<00:02:40.260> more<00:02:40.560> plastic<00:02:41.280> especially

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
cure it gets more plastic especially

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.580 
cure it gets more plastic especially
because<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.210> the<00:02:42.360> additives<00:02:43.080> I<00:02:43.170> put<00:02:43.380> in<00:02:43.470> it

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
because of the additives I put in it

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.740 
because of the additives I put in it
that<00:02:43.770> help<00:02:43.980> with<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.490> plasticity<00:02:44.850> of<00:02:45.150> it<00:02:45.390> it

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
that help with the plasticity of it it

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.060 
that help with the plasticity of it it
gets<00:02:45.960> more<00:02:46.140> plastic<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.620> it's<00:02:46.740> more

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
gets more plastic and it's more

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:55.160 
gets more plastic and it's more
malleable<00:02:47.670> that<00:02:52.970> stage<00:02:53.970> lasts<00:02:54.660> as<00:02:54.930> long<00:02:54.960> as

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
malleable that stage lasts as long as

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.290 
malleable that stage lasts as long as
the<00:02:55.500> first<00:02:55.740> stage<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.280> so<00:02:56.550> you<00:02:56.670> have<00:02:56.760> a<00:02:56.790> lot<00:02:57.120> of

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
the first stage and so you have a lot of

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.050 
the first stage and so you have a lot of
working<00:02:57.510> time<00:02:57.870> in<00:02:58.140> that<00:02:58.380> stage<00:02:58.710> and<00:02:59.010> then<00:02:59.430> it

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
working time in that stage and then it

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.380 
working time in that stage and then it
starts<00:03:00.540> to<00:03:00.630> take<00:03:00.900> on<00:03:01.050> a<00:03:01.260> more<00:03:01.790> stone<00:03:02.790> light<00:03:03.150> but

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
starts to take on a more stone light but

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.110 
starts to take on a more stone light but
a<00:03:03.420> real<00:03:03.750> soft<00:03:04.170> stone<00:03:04.590> like<00:03:04.890> quality<00:03:05.640> you<00:03:05.970> can

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
a real soft stone like quality you can

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.480 
a real soft stone like quality you can
carve<00:03:06.420> it<00:03:06.600> gently<00:03:07.260> with<00:03:07.440> a<00:03:07.470> knife<00:03:07.740> as<00:03:08.070> it

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
carve it gently with a knife as it

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.060 
carve it gently with a knife as it
continues<00:03:09.120> to<00:03:09.330> cure<00:03:09.600> you<00:03:10.020> then<00:03:10.200> get<00:03:10.440> out<00:03:10.560> more

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
continues to cure you then get out more

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.430 
continues to cure you then get out more
heavy-duty<00:03:11.370> tools<00:03:11.850> to<00:03:12.390> to<00:03:12.780> carve<00:03:13.020> it<00:03:13.140> but<00:03:13.290> it's

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
heavy-duty tools to to carve it but it's

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.920 
heavy-duty tools to to carve it but it's
still<00:03:13.530> like<00:03:13.980> a<00:03:14.010> soapstone<00:03:14.400> like<00:03:14.910> a<00:03:14.940> real<00:03:15.240> soft

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
still like a soapstone like a real soft

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.500 
still like a soapstone like a real soft
stone

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.449 

ultimately<00:03:22.510> after<00:03:22.870> a<00:03:23.409> couple<00:03:23.799> of<00:03:23.890> weeks<00:03:24.099> it

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
ultimately after a couple of weeks it

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.330 
ultimately after a couple of weeks it
then<00:03:25.090> takes<00:03:25.390> on<00:03:25.510> a<00:03:25.569> more<00:03:25.930> the<00:03:26.829> concrete<00:03:27.250> you're

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
then takes on a more the concrete you're

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.949 
then takes on a more the concrete you're
familiar<00:03:27.519> with<00:03:27.790> it<00:03:28.090> we<00:03:28.180> walk<00:03:28.390> on<00:03:28.599> every<00:03:28.810> day

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
familiar with it we walk on every day

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.319 
familiar with it we walk on every day
and<00:03:29.140> then<00:03:30.069> you're<00:03:30.280> getting<00:03:30.430> out<00:03:30.670> the<00:03:30.849> angle

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
and then you're getting out the angle

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.300 
and then you're getting out the angle
grinder<00:03:31.450> and<00:03:31.870> more<00:03:32.230> heavy-duty<00:03:32.650> tools<00:03:33.069> that

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
grinder and more heavy-duty tools that

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.750 
grinder and more heavy-duty tools that
we're<00:03:33.459> making<00:03:33.579> adjustments<00:03:34.209> at<00:03:34.299> that<00:03:34.420> stage

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.630 

so<00:03:39.760> I<00:03:39.790> like<00:03:40.299> that<00:03:40.329> it<00:03:40.900> has<00:03:40.930> a<00:03:41.110> life<00:03:41.409> and<00:03:41.769> every

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
so I like that it has a life and every

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.809 
so I like that it has a life and every
stage<00:03:42.939> of<00:03:43.150> it<00:03:43.269> I<00:03:43.480> can<00:03:44.290> compose<00:03:44.650> I<00:03:45.040> can<00:03:45.250> alter<00:03:45.519> I

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
stage of it I can compose I can alter I

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.270 
stage of it I can compose I can alter I
can<00:03:46.090> edit<00:03:46.269> and<00:03:46.599> every<00:03:46.959> stage<00:03:47.230> bring<00:03:47.560> surprises

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
can edit and every stage bring surprises

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.729 
can edit and every stage bring surprises
if<00:03:48.970> it<00:03:49.209> fractures<00:03:49.689> in<00:03:49.810> a<00:03:49.870> way<00:03:50.019> that<00:03:50.260> I<00:03:50.290> don't

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
if it fractures in a way that I don't

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.130 
if it fractures in a way that I don't
like<00:03:50.950> I<00:03:51.159> can<00:03:51.430> add<00:03:51.549> to<00:03:51.760> it<00:03:51.909> if<00:03:52.450> it<00:03:52.629> fractures<00:03:53.019> in

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
like I can add to it if it fractures in

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.390 
like I can add to it if it fractures in
a<00:03:53.200> way<00:03:53.290> that<00:03:53.470> I<00:03:53.500> do<00:03:53.590> like<00:03:53.860> I<00:03:54.010> can<00:03:54.159> leave<00:03:54.280> it

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
a way that I do like I can leave it

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.910 
a way that I do like I can leave it
alone<00:03:54.579> and<00:03:54.819> it's<00:03:55.569> kind<00:03:56.140> of<00:03:56.200> how<00:03:56.349> I<00:03:56.379> work

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
alone and it's kind of how I work

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:04.710 
alone and it's kind of how I work
I<00:04:01.019> have<00:04:02.280> classical<00:04:03.280> training<00:04:04.060> that<00:04:04.390> involves

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
I have classical training that involves

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.530 
I have classical training that involves
modeling<00:04:05.560> and<00:04:05.859> clay<00:04:06.069> creating<00:04:06.879> molds<00:04:07.329> from

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
modeling and clay creating molds from

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.020 
modeling and clay creating molds from
plaster<00:04:08.140> modeling<00:04:09.069> and<00:04:09.189> plaster<00:04:09.670> and<00:04:09.879> then

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
plaster modeling and plaster and then

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.660 
plaster modeling and plaster and then
casting<00:04:10.690> materials<00:04:11.200> I've<00:04:11.709> also<00:04:11.920> studied<00:04:12.280> some

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
casting materials I've also studied some

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.599 
casting materials I've also studied some
stone<00:04:12.970> carving<00:04:13.480> and<00:04:13.750> this<00:04:14.739> allows<00:04:15.099> me<00:04:15.310> to<00:04:15.340> do

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609 
stone carving and this allows me to do

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:22.020 
stone carving and this allows me to do
all<00:04:15.909> of<00:04:15.970> that<00:04:16.539> in<00:04:16.750> one<00:04:16.810> piece

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.450 

I<00:04:22.060> will<00:04:22.780> model<00:04:23.140> some<00:04:23.350> works<00:04:23.680> by<00:04:23.920> pink<00:04:24.250> clay

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
I will model some works by pink clay

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.390 
I will model some works by pink clay
create<00:04:25.420> a<00:04:25.480> mold<00:04:25.750> from<00:04:25.990> it<00:04:26.200> cast<00:04:26.950> it<00:04:27.190> in<00:04:27.370> the

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
create a mold from it cast it in the

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.280 
create a mold from it cast it in the
concrete<00:04:27.970> material<00:04:28.450> so<00:04:28.600> I<00:04:28.630> can<00:04:28.840> continue<00:04:29.140> to

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
concrete material so I can continue to

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.330 
concrete material so I can continue to
work<00:04:29.410> at<00:04:29.710> that<00:04:29.890> way

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
work at that way

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.970 
work at that way
so<00:04:30.880> then<00:04:31.150> I'm<00:04:31.360> working<00:04:31.570> like<00:04:32.410> I'm<00:04:32.590> working<00:04:32.890> in

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
so then I'm working like I'm working in

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.380 
so then I'm working like I'm working in
stone<00:04:33.250> and<00:04:33.460> working<00:04:33.760> like<00:04:33.880> I'm<00:04:34.030> working<00:04:34.300> in

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
stone and working like I'm working in

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:42.920 
stone and working like I'm working in
clay<00:04:34.660> and<00:04:34.690> it<00:04:35.260> evolved

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.990
