and<00:00:18.630> time<00:00:18.810> machine<00:00:19.109> makes<00:00:19.289> it<00:00:19.439> very<00:00:19.710> easy<00:00:19.890> now

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
and time machine makes it very easy now

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:21.859 
and time machine makes it very easy now
there<00:00:20.850> are<00:00:20.939> several<00:00:21.240> reasons<00:00:21.510> why<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:21.689> should

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
but besides that you can also recover

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.959 
but besides that you can also recover
from<00:00:37.890> another<00:00:38.129> type<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.340> failure<00:00:38.520> say<00:00:38.910> if

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
from another type of failure say if

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.420 
from another type of failure say if
somebody<00:00:39.149> steals<00:00:39.660> your<00:00:39.870> macbook<00:00:40.410> or<00:00:40.620> if

there's a fire or flood or something
like<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.770> in<00:00:44.190> some<00:00:44.670> way<00:00:45.360> your<00:00:45.930> Mac<00:00:46.379> gets

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
like that in some way your Mac gets

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.700 
like that in some way your Mac gets
destroyed<00:00:47.250> if<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.120> have<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.270> backup<00:00:48.899> then<00:00:49.469> you

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
destroyed if you have a backup then you

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.750 
destroyed if you have a backup then you
have<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.860> better<00:00:50.039> chance<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.399> be<00:00:50.460> able<00:00:50.700> to

recover and put all of your data on to a
new<00:00:53.309> computer<00:00:53.879> now<00:00:54.059> some<00:00:54.719> people<00:00:54.840> think<00:00:55.140> well

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
new computer now some people think well

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.720 
new computer now some people think well
I<00:00:55.410> don't<00:00:55.710> have<00:00:55.800> anything<00:00:55.980> not<00:00:56.250> important<00:00:56.699> on

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
I don't have anything not important on

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.000 
I don't have anything not important on
my<00:00:56.850> computer<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:57.960> don't<00:00:58.260> need<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.440> backup

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
my computer so I don't need to backup

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.549 
my computer so I don't need to backup
well<00:00:59.250> that's<00:00:59.550> rarely<00:00:59.879> ever<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.480> case<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.989> mean

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
well that's rarely ever the case I mean

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.740 
well that's rarely ever the case I mean
even<00:01:01.890> if<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.070> have<00:01:02.190> just<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.550> few<00:01:02.579> photos<00:01:03.270> or

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
even if you have just a few photos or

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.950 
even if you have just a few photos or
some<00:01:04.589> simple<00:01:05.010> documents<00:01:05.640> on<00:01:05.760> there<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.570> could

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
some simple documents on there it could

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.440 
some simple documents on there it could
be<00:01:07.080> very<00:01:07.350> difficult<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.950> recover<00:01:08.310> from<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:09.119> hard

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
be very difficult to recover from a hard

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.090 
be very difficult to recover from a hard
drive<00:01:09.659> failure<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.590> it's<00:01:10.740> important<00:01:11.010> for

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
drive failure so it's important for

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.289 
drive failure so it's important for
everybody<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.400> backup<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.850> doesn't<00:01:12.119> really

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
everybody a backup it doesn't really

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.160 
everybody a backup it doesn't really
cost<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.810> much

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
cost that much

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.530 
cost that much
hard<00:01:13.680> drives<00:01:13.979> today<00:01:14.400> are<00:01:14.580> really<00:01:15.060> cheap<00:01:15.330> you

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
hard drives today are really cheap you

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.719 
hard drives today are really cheap you
can<00:01:15.900> get<00:01:16.020> one<00:01:16.200> terabyte<00:01:16.680> external<00:01:16.710> USB<00:01:17.490> hard

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729

to backup or if you have the money and
you<00:01:31.590> have<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.040> say<00:01:32.159> portable<00:01:32.579> computer<00:01:32.880> like<00:01:33.000> a

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
you have to say portable computer like a

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.060 
you have to say portable computer like a
MacBook<00:01:33.450> look<00:01:33.720> into<00:01:33.930> getting<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.290> time<00:01:34.560> capsule

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
MacBook look into getting a time capsule

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.960 
MacBook look into getting a time capsule
so<00:01:35.280> for<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:35.909> example<00:01:36.210> I've<00:01:36.720> got<00:01:36.930> this<00:01:37.140> fairly

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
so for this example I've got this fairly

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.999 
so for this example I've got this fairly
inexpensive<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.689> little<00:01:39.869> outdated<00:01:40.229> hard

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
inexpensive and a little outdated hard

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.649

you now the first time you're backing up

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.880 
you now the first time you're backing up
it's<00:02:42.190> going<00:02:42.580> to<00:02:42.700> take<00:02:42.910> a<00:02:42.940> long<00:02:43.210> time<00:02:43.420> it's

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
it's going to take a long time it's

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.620 
it's going to take a long time it's
going<00:02:44.890> to<00:02:44.980> have<00:02:45.190> many<00:02:45.970> gigabytes<00:02:46.420> in<00:02:46.540> this

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
going to have many gigabytes in this

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.630 
going to have many gigabytes in this
case<00:02:46.810> they're<00:02:46.960> going<00:02:46.990> to<00:02:47.140> be<00:02:47.200> 30<00:02:47.560> gigs<00:02:47.890> of<00:02:48.100> data

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
case they're going to be 30 gigs of data

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.520 
case they're going to be 30 gigs of data
to<00:02:48.880> back<00:02:49.030> up<00:02:49.240> from<00:02:49.420> this<00:02:49.570> MacBook<00:02:49.900> Air<00:02:50.230> you<00:02:50.380> may

so<00:02:53.110> you<00:02:53.590> may<00:02:53.770> want<00:02:53.950> to<00:02:54.010> do<00:02:54.130> that<00:02:54.160> overnight<00:02:54.550> get

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
so you may want to do that overnight get

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.940 
so you may want to do that overnight get
it<00:02:55.600> going<00:02:55.840> in<00:02:55.960> the<00:02:56.050> evening<00:02:56.380> and<00:02:56.560> have<00:02:56.710> it<00:02:56.830> back

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
it going in the evening and have it back

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.310 
it going in the evening and have it back
up<00:02:57.130> overnight<00:02:57.510> afterwards<00:02:58.510> it<00:02:58.750> will<00:02:58.870> backup

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
up overnight afterwards it will backup

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.120 
up overnight afterwards it will backup
just<00:02:59.740> whatever<00:03:00.400> changes<00:03:01.650> and<00:03:02.650> you<00:03:02.890> won't<00:03:03.040> have

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
just whatever changes and you won't have

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.250 
just whatever changes and you won't have
to<00:03:03.220> worry<00:03:03.550> so<00:03:03.790> much<00:03:03.820> about<00:03:04.330> a<00:03:04.630> long<00:03:04.900> time<00:03:05.110> it's

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
to worry so much about a long time it's

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.540 
to worry so much about a long time it's
a<00:03:05.290> matter<00:03:05.350> of<00:03:05.470> fact<00:03:05.620> it'll<00:03:05.770> backup<00:03:06.070> every<00:03:06.400> hour

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
a matter of fact it'll backup every hour

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.700 
a matter of fact it'll backup every hour
so<00:03:07.450> here<00:03:07.690> you<00:03:07.750> can<00:03:07.840> see<00:03:07.990> it's<00:03:08.140> already<00:03:08.290> started

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
so here you can see it's already started

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.040 
so here you can see it's already started
the<00:03:08.800> backup<00:03:09.160> and<00:03:09.370> it's<00:03:09.880> well<00:03:10.090> on<00:03:10.120> its<00:03:10.300> way<00:03:10.570> the

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
the backup and it's well on its way the

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.740 
the backup and it's well on its way the
only<00:03:11.200> options<00:03:11.620> I<00:03:11.740> have<00:03:11.890> here<00:03:12.160> are<00:03:12.340> to<00:03:12.880> exclude

your network for a time capsule and that
you<00:03:42.459> do<00:03:42.700> that<00:03:42.940> often<00:03:43.240> enough<00:03:43.630> to<00:03:44.080> make<00:03:44.230> the

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
you do that often enough to make the

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.040 
you do that often enough to make the
backups<00:03:44.920> worthwhile<00:03:45.520> so<00:03:46.150> maybe<00:03:46.390> once<00:03:46.780> a<00:03:46.900> day

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
backup you can do it manually so the key

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:55.500 
backup you can do it manually so the key
is<00:03:54.790> you<00:03:54.850> want<00:03:54.910> to<00:03:55.060> make<00:03:55.150> sure<00:03:55.180> in<00:03:55.420> your

it's<00:04:01.600> spinning<00:04:01.900> because<00:04:01.990> it's<00:04:02.170> doing<00:04:02.410> the

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
it's spinning because it's doing the

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.620 
it's spinning because it's doing the
backup<00:04:02.800> right<00:04:02.950> now<00:04:03.130> and<00:04:03.370> you'll<00:04:04.300> have<00:04:04.510> the

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
backup right now and you'll have the

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.350 
backup right now and you'll have the
ability<00:04:04.930> to<00:04:04.959> start<00:04:05.500> a<00:04:05.770> backup<00:04:06.580> right<00:04:06.880> away<00:04:06.940> and

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
ability to start a backup right away and

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.090 
ability to start a backup right away and
not<00:04:07.420> wait<00:04:07.810> for<00:04:07.840> the<00:04:08.230> regular<00:04:08.620> scheduled<00:04:08.950> time

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
not wait for the regular scheduled time

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.130 
not wait for the regular scheduled time
so<00:04:09.520> you<00:04:09.610> plug<00:04:09.880> your<00:04:09.940> macbook<00:04:10.450> in<00:04:10.600> at<00:04:10.750> night<00:04:10.900> to

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
so you plug your macbook in at night to

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.400 
so you plug your macbook in at night to
the<00:04:11.370> backup<00:04:12.370> drive<00:04:12.610> and<00:04:12.910> you<00:04:13.540> just<00:04:13.990> initiate<00:04:14.380> a

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
the backup drive and you just initiate a

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:15.990 
the backup drive and you just initiate a
backup<00:04:14.770> right<00:04:14.890> away<00:04:14.950> wait<00:04:15.550> till<00:04:15.730> it's<00:04:15.880> done

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
backup right away wait till it's done

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000 
backup right away wait till it's done
and<00:04:16.150> you<00:04:16.270> can<00:04:16.420> unplug<00:04:16.780> the<00:04:17.020> drive<00:04:17.230> then<00:04:17.470> just

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
and you can unplug the drive then just

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.680 
and you can unplug the drive then just
make<00:04:18.160> sure<00:04:18.280> you<00:04:18.370> do<00:04:18.489> that<00:04:18.609> on<00:04:18.790> a<00:04:18.820> regular<00:04:19.120> basis

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
make sure you do that on a regular basis

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.350 
make sure you do that on a regular basis
so<00:04:20.109> your<00:04:20.799> backups<00:04:21.310> are<00:04:21.520> as<00:04:21.850> current<00:04:22.270> as

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
so your backups are as current as

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.630 
so your backups are as current as
possible<00:04:22.590> so<00:04:23.590> how<00:04:23.710> do<00:04:23.770> you<00:04:24.010> use<00:04:24.190> time<00:04:24.490> machine

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
possible so how do you use time machine

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.640 
possible so how do you use time machine
to<00:04:25.180> say<00:04:25.390> recover<00:04:25.750> a<00:04:25.870> single<00:04:26.050> file

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
to say recover a single file

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.370 
to say recover a single file
well<00:04:26.979> here<00:04:27.550> I<00:04:27.610> am<00:04:27.790> on<00:04:28.000> another<00:04:28.660> machine<00:04:28.990> here

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
well here I am on another machine here

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.770 
well here I am on another machine here

then I won't have to worry about
replacing<00:05:14.770> it<00:05:15.130> it'll<00:05:15.400> just<00:05:15.610> put<00:05:16.060> it<00:05:16.150> there<00:05:16.330> so

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
replacing it it'll just put it there so

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.060 
replacing it it'll just put it there so

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
what else can you do with the time

of different ways that you can recover
but<00:05:51.550> the<00:05:51.669> important<00:05:52.180> thing<00:05:52.360> is<00:05:52.539> to<00:05:52.570> take<00:05:52.810> that

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
but the important thing is to take that

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.570 
but the important thing is to take that
first<00:05:53.200> step<00:05:53.349> and<00:05:53.500> have<00:05:53.889> that<00:05:54.160> time<00:05:54.340> machine

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 
first step and have that time machine

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.670 
first step and have that time machine
back<00:05:54.729> up<00:05:54.880> to<00:05:55.000> begin<00:05:55.150> with<00:05:55.300> or<00:05:55.660> none<00:05:56.500> of<00:05:56.620> these

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680
