don't know like a death machine or
something<00:01:19.409> over<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:20.520> map<00:01:20.729> right<00:01:20.939> now

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
something over in this map right now

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.630 
something over in this map right now
like<00:01:21.990> put<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.770> in<00:01:22.860> from<00:01:23.040> diaries<00:01:23.189> or<00:01:23.369> whatever

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
like put it in from diaries or whatever

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.640 
like put it in from diaries or whatever
so<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.850> second<00:01:24.090> thing<00:01:24.330> is<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.869> bank<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.500> is

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
so the second thing is the bank that is

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.080 
so the second thing is the bank that is
linked<00:01:25.920> between<00:01:26.130> everything<00:01:26.759> else<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.060> you

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
linked between everything else so you

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.030 
linked between everything else so you
saw<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.450> looked<00:01:27.689> at<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.869> bank<00:01:28.080> actually<00:01:28.950> I

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
saw that looked at the bank actually I

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.410 
saw that looked at the bank actually I
just<00:01:29.250> thought<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.520> was<00:01:29.610> some<00:01:29.790> random<00:01:29.820> room

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
just thought it was some random room
