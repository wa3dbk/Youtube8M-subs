00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:18.140
 a more social and more human capitalism the time has come to wake up from 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.539
 rise and fight they have abused power and corrupted justice not 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.590
 there will be freedom as long as there is no true democracy 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.550
 political power is a corrupt system in order to give benefit to 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.779
 those who profit from it 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.210
 we need a more social capitalism more human we need that politics 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.829
 benefits the citizen not the state we live within a structure 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:40.420
 wrong economic 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.440
 capitalism to um in cutting social inequalities 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.800
 making the rich richer than the poorest poor 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.590
 there are now more than 800 million people who go hungry 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.660
 the economic and social structure in which we live favors the most 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.040
 powerful we know that there is no perfect economic formula because 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.650
 On the other side of capitalism, communism limits freedom and the expectations of 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:04.180
 lifetime 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.350
 we need politicians and with clear ideas and a responsible policy that 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.630
 engage with the ordinary citizen 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.740
 we are fed up with jiabao demagoguery that they do not lie to the face we want them to 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.869
 every party and every politician recognizes his mistake when he commits it and that he presents 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.560
 his resignation automatically when he gets involved in a scandal of 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.590
 corruption 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.829
 we demand laws that support these positions 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:28.510
 we want you to believe 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.610
 that the economy is reactivated if there is no private money that money is used 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.340
 of taxpayers to alleviate the crisis by creating sources of employment 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.310
 public 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.270
 if there is no employment, there is no consumption and if there is no consumption the economy goes to the rack 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.560
 that the state benefits the citizens and not the citizen to the state 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.049
 we can not allow the rulers to continue investing millions of euros in 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:53.720
 finance space projects to satisfy scientific curiosity 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.130
 when there are about 920 million people in the world who suffer from hunger and 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.030
 malnutrition 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.430
 this represents 13 comma 2 percent of the world's population 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.720
 first solutions for the serious problems of our society 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.120
 and then everything else 

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.440
 all citizens of the countries of the earth must choose their constitution 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.060
 freely by voting 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.000
 and each country should propose several proposals drawn up by the people most 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.470
 wise and responsible to collect the wishes and desires of citizens to the 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.590
 that they have to serve 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.070
 the presidents the governors 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.280
 the senators the deputies all those people who represent the 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.719
 citizen must have a fixed salary that has been established by citizens 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:39.739
 and that no politician can increase or decrease his public salary to his 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.109
 I am craving, as is happening now, all public representatives 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:45.849
 that steals from state coffers 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:50.060
 He must bear the full weight of the law and be judged and treated as 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.640
 an offender there should be no diplomatic immunity and no privilege to 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:55.439
 A politician 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:57.780
 because he is a public representative 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.800
 we appeal to all honest citizens of this world to 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.680
 go out on the street in peaceful protest to head to the most important squares 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.600
 from each of your cities and camping there the demand to the 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.409
 governments a more social and responsible capitalism with the citizen 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:17.549
 everything depends on us it is time to take the rein of our destiny and 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.680
 form the greatest revolution the world has ever seen 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.299
 for the present for the future we form a global social revolution
