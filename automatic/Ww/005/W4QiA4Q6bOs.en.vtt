00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.090
 I want to think that like two weeks three 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:06.130
 weeks is going to last a long time I 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:09.310
 boot a bit with the knife 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.040
 you are going to use less every day you can 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.890
 use let's say half of this 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.930
 cachito for a day a mask and what 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.930
 what you are going to be using is only 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.140
 the heart that says to him you are going to take with 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.150
 very careful 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.610
 this part of here is the one you're going to be 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.240
 using and applying on your skin as 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:33.060
 it's a very vague date does not have a very 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.860
 strong but it's like I almost do not like 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.040
 the smell you are going to be applying in your 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.650
 skin and everything to apply a face 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.170
 clean and washed for around 30 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.390
 minutes until it dries daily diary 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.580
 at night or in the morning as you 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.800
 feel better and how you have more time 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.860
 you will notice that the two weeks are going to 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:56.670
 start erasing those acne marks that 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:59.489
 you had those red spots for older ones 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.709
 that are that you have years with those 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.420
 scars from those red spots you 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.360
 I assure that aloe is going to help you 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.430
 very much another thing that I have used 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.700
 and it has worked very well for me 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:15.090
 that I am using is still this 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.370
 aloe vera aloe vera oil with 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.739
 vitamin and I apply this to all 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.130
 nights on my face in before sleeping 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:25.709
 I leave me with a mask I apply 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.150
 all over my face and I sleep with it 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.290
 I apply it like half an hour before 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.450
 sleep for 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.069
 make sure that my skin absorbs it 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.250
 that is possible so as not to dirty the 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:37.799
 pillows of the blankets and the truth 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.099
 I swear I've noticed a difference had 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:43.230
 several red dots here of pimples 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:46.500
 that had come out in that part and this 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.430
 wonder this little one has me this 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.010
 erased 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.930
 It has helped me a lot and I bought it 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:57.030
 in walmart and it's not expensive, I think 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:59.040
 three or four dollars the vitamin e that 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.170
 contains this will benefit us 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.629
 moisturize our face and it's a 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.879
 super good treatment to eliminate 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:09.419
 the acne marks you can use the 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:10.739
 natural aloe or this little bottle here 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:12.930
 same way the two are going to help you 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:15.060
 pretty enough more if you want your 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.310

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.449
 vitamin e you can do it to have 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.910
 best results 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:23.449
 you can buy those pills that are 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.620
 of vitamin e to drink tea you can 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:28.169
 make them an eye with a needle 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.270
 break them and apply it on the face together 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.370
 with the natural aloe that you have to be 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.990
 and it is very very important and it is to plunder your 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.110
 face before applying 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.970

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.870
