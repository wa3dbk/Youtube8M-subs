although<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.640> devs<00:01:59.850> were<00:02:00.000> quick<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.479> point

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
although the devs were quick to point

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.600 
although the devs were quick to point
out<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.619> can't<00:02:01.799> really<00:02:01.950> predict<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
out that you can't really predict the

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.240 
out that you can't really predict the
long-term<00:02:02.759> impacts<00:02:03.479> of<00:02:03.750> your<00:02:03.840> choices<00:02:04.250> so

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
long-term impacts of your choices so

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.889 
long-term impacts of your choices so
maybe<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:06.030> know<00:02:06.149> if<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.420> pick<00:02:06.659> something

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
maybe you know if you pick something

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.300 
maybe you know if you pick something
that<00:02:07.079> makes<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.560> conversation<00:02:07.979> go<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.099> little

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
that makes the conversation go a little

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.760 
that makes the conversation go a little
bit<00:02:08.399> smoother<00:02:08.819> or<00:02:09.200> makes<00:02:10.200> you're<00:02:10.470> kind<00:02:10.679> of

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
bit smoother or makes you're kind of

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.110 
bit smoother or makes you're kind of
short<00:02:11.489> term<00:02:11.730> plans<00:02:12.060> work<00:02:12.690> it<00:02:13.080> might<00:02:13.379> have

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
short term plans work it might have

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.270 
short term plans work it might have
negative<00:02:14.420> impact<00:02:14.780> on<00:02:14.959> the<00:02:15.230> long-term<00:02:15.709> plans<00:02:16.010> I

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
negative impact on the long-term plans I

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.119 
negative impact on the long-term plans I
hope<00:02:16.549> so<00:02:16.970> otherwise<00:02:17.360> is<00:02:18.019> just<00:02:18.049> think<00:02:18.920> if<00:02:19.010> it's

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129 
hope so otherwise is just think if it's

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:21.130 
hope so otherwise is just think if it's
not<00:02:19.190> really<00:02:19.519> much<00:02:19.940> else<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:20.269> it<00:02:20.510> so<00:02:20.810> yeah<00:02:21.110> I

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
not really much else to it so yeah I

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.440 
not really much else to it so yeah I

during<00:03:21.290> this<00:03:21.470> to<00:03:21.590> this<00:03:21.709> episode<00:03:22.099> the<00:03:22.310> two<00:03:22.430> are

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
during this to this episode the two are

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.300 
during this to this episode the two are
reunited<00:03:23.120> and<00:03:23.500> you<00:03:24.500> find<00:03:24.709> out<00:03:24.829> that<00:03:25.010> a<00:03:25.069> third

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
reunited and you find out that a third

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.550 
reunited and you find out that a third
girl<00:03:25.519> Rachel<00:03:26.150> another<00:03:26.870> close<00:03:27.079> friend<00:03:27.380> of

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
girl Rachel another close friend of

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.619 
girl Rachel another close friend of
Chloe's<00:03:27.980> has<00:03:28.609> gone<00:03:28.970> missing<00:03:29.359> and<00:03:29.510> nobody

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:29.629 
Chloe's has gone missing and nobody

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:31.720 
Chloe's has gone missing and nobody
really<00:03:30.079> seems<00:03:30.349> to<00:03:30.530> be<00:03:30.620> quite<00:03:30.859> sure<00:03:31.069> what

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
really seems to be quite sure what

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:32.440 
really seems to be quite sure what
happened<00:03:31.910> there

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
happened there

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.180 
happened there
and<00:03:32.540> so<00:03:32.690> it<00:03:32.780> looks<00:03:32.959> like<00:03:33.139> the<00:03:33.260> story<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:34.010> life

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
and so it looks like the story the life

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.680 
and so it looks like the story the life
is<00:03:34.370> strange<00:03:34.609> once<00:03:34.849> the<00:03:34.970> tile<00:03:35.150> is<00:03:35.359> centered

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
is strange once the tile is centered

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.659 
is strange once the tile is centered
around<00:03:35.750> that<00:03:36.220> disappearance<00:03:37.220> and<00:03:37.489> more

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:37.669 
around that disappearance and more

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:40.030 
around that disappearance and more
specifically<00:03:38.150> Max<00:03:38.900> and<00:03:39.230> Chloe<00:03:39.379> trying<00:03:39.950> to

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
specifically Max and Chloe trying to

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.740 
specifically Max and Chloe trying to
find<00:03:40.280> it<00:03:40.459> that's<00:03:40.609> the<00:03:40.819> mystery<00:03:41.090> to<00:03:41.299> unravel

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
find it that's the mystery to unravel

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.809 
find it that's the mystery to unravel
and<00:03:41.989> you'd<00:03:42.379> imagine<00:03:42.889> that<00:03:43.010> Max's<00:03:43.280> power<00:03:43.489> will

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:43.819 
and you'd imagine that Max's power will

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.000 
and you'd imagine that Max's power will
prove<00:03:44.090> fairly<00:03:44.900> important<00:03:45.349> along<00:03:45.799> the<00:03:45.889> way

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
prove fairly important along the way

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.439 
prove fairly important along the way
you'd<00:03:46.519> hope<00:03:46.699> so<00:03:46.910> anyway

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:47.449 
you'd hope so anyway

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:49.920 
you'd hope so anyway
to<00:03:48.049> be<00:03:48.139> honest<00:03:48.319> the<00:03:48.440> time<00:03:48.620> rewind<00:03:48.859> stuff<00:03:49.280> is

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
to be honest the time rewind stuff is

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.240 
to be honest the time rewind stuff is
just<00:03:50.930> really<00:03:51.169> it<00:03:51.260> feels<00:03:51.440> like<00:03:51.560> the<00:03:51.650> gamey<00:03:51.889> part

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
just really it feels like the gamey part

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.159 
just really it feels like the gamey part
of<00:03:52.549> what<00:03:52.940> I've<00:03:53.150> seen<00:03:53.329> so<00:03:53.540> far<00:03:53.569> it's<00:03:53.959> what<00:03:54.079> you

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:54.169 
of what I've seen so far it's what you

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:56.710 
of what I've seen so far it's what you
traditionally<00:03:54.349> described<00:03:55.190> as<00:03:55.400> a<00:03:56.090> gameplay

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
traditionally described as a gameplay

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.349 
traditionally described as a gameplay
mechanic<00:03:57.410> right<00:03:57.620> the<00:03:58.010> ability<00:03:58.129> to<00:03:58.609> rewind

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
mechanic right the ability to rewind

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:02.199 
mechanic right the ability to rewind
time<00:03:59.480> and<00:03:59.980> you<00:04:00.980> know<00:04:01.069> try<00:04:01.459> a<00:04:01.489> certain<00:04:01.910> section

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
time and you know try a certain section

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.569 
time and you know try a certain section
of<00:04:02.269> the<00:04:02.419> game<00:04:02.569> again<00:04:02.900> I<00:04:03.139> haven't<00:04:03.829> really<00:04:03.980> seen

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
of the game again I haven't really seen

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:07.030 
of the game again I haven't really seen
so<00:04:05.299> far<00:04:05.569> why<00:04:05.750> the<00:04:05.810> story<00:04:06.169> really<00:04:06.440> benefits

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
so far why the story really benefits

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.710 
so far why the story really benefits
from<00:04:07.160> its<00:04:07.579> inclusion<00:04:07.940> although<00:04:08.480> it<00:04:08.599> certainly

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
from its inclusion although it certainly

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.180 
from its inclusion although it certainly
makes<00:04:09.019> the<00:04:09.079> game<00:04:09.319> more<00:04:09.530> interesting<00:04:09.590> to<00:04:10.069> play

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
makes the game more interesting to play

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.349 
makes the game more interesting to play
I<00:04:11.109> yeah<00:04:12.109> I<00:04:12.169> don't<00:04:12.290> know<00:04:12.609> why<00:04:13.609> this<00:04:13.669> story<00:04:14.120> needs

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:14.359 
I yeah I don't know why this story needs

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:15.460 
I yeah I don't know why this story needs
it<00:04:14.540> and<00:04:14.599> that's<00:04:14.780> something<00:04:15.049> I'm<00:04:15.290> kind<00:04:15.440> of

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
it and that's something I'm kind of

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.650 
it and that's something I'm kind of
intrigued<00:04:15.769> to<00:04:15.799> see<00:04:16.130> play<00:04:17.120> out<00:04:17.150> throughout<00:04:17.570> the

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
intrigued to see play out throughout the

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.390 
intrigued to see play out throughout the
rest<00:04:17.959> of<00:04:18.079> these<00:04:18.410> episodes<00:04:18.709> is<00:04:18.979> for<00:04:19.190> more

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
rest of these episodes is for more

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.580 
rest of these episodes is for more
planned<00:04:19.639> from<00:04:19.849> don't<00:04:20.120> nod<00:04:20.299> to<00:04:21.169> complete<00:04:21.470> this

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
planned from don't nod to complete this

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.200 
planned from don't nod to complete this
season<00:04:22.039> and<00:04:22.630> yeah<00:04:23.630> I'm<00:04:24.099> intrigued<00:04:25.099> why<00:04:25.310> max

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
season and yeah I'm intrigued why max

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.850 
season and yeah I'm intrigued why max
needs<00:04:26.570> the<00:04:26.870> power<00:04:27.020> three<00:04:27.560> one

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
needs the power three one

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.559 
needs the power three one
because<00:04:28.370> it<00:04:28.520> seems<00:04:28.879> like<00:04:29.000> they're<00:04:29.300> telling

00:04:29.559 --> 00:04:29.569 
because it seems like they're telling

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.140 
because it seems like they're telling
quite<00:04:29.780> a<00:04:29.990> small<00:04:30.830> story<00:04:31.159> here<00:04:31.490> right<00:04:31.759> the<00:04:32.030> whole

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
quite a small story here right the whole

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.089 
quite a small story here right the whole
thing<00:04:32.330> is<00:04:32.479> focused<00:04:33.020> around<00:04:33.139> quite<00:04:34.009> an

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:34.099 
thing is focused around quite an

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:36.520 
thing is focused around quite an
unremarkable<00:04:34.750> American<00:04:35.750> town<00:04:35.990> there's

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
unremarkable American town there's

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:37.839 
unremarkable American town there's
obviously<00:04:36.770> this<00:04:36.919> tempest<00:04:37.400> that<00:04:37.430> they're<00:04:37.699> on

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:37.849 
obviously this tempest that they're on

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:40.240 
obviously this tempest that they're on
and<00:04:38.120> then<00:04:38.210> the<00:04:38.330> relationships<00:04:38.870> there<00:04:39.169> but<00:04:39.530> it

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
and then the relationships there but it

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.070 
and then the relationships there but it
just<00:04:40.460> feels<00:04:40.639> like<00:04:40.819> the<00:04:40.969> story<00:04:41.270> that<00:04:41.840> don't

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
just feels like the story that don't

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.439 
just feels like the story that don't
know<00:04:42.229> I'd<00:04:42.379> want<00:04:42.590> to<00:04:42.680> tell<00:04:42.919> is<00:04:43.250> you<00:04:43.669> know<00:04:44.090> quite

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
know I'd want to tell is you know quite

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:46.839 
know I'd want to tell is you know quite
small<00:04:44.780> despite<00:04:45.229> this<00:04:45.500> inclusion<00:04:45.889> of<00:04:46.189> such<00:04:46.819> a

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:46.849 
small despite this inclusion of such a

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:49.119 
small despite this inclusion of such a
unique<00:04:47.780> and<00:04:48.020> interesting<00:04:48.199> power<00:04:48.710> that<00:04:48.949> would

00:04:49.119 --> 00:04:49.129 
unique and interesting power that would

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:52.420 
unique and interesting power that would
potentially<00:04:49.729> have<00:04:50.419> you<00:04:50.930> know<00:04:51.430> life-changing

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
potentially have you know life-changing

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.480 
potentially have you know life-changing
world-changing<00:04:53.349> consequences<00:04:54.349> it<00:04:54.949> seems<00:04:55.250> at

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
world-changing consequences it seems at

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.309 
world-changing consequences it seems at
least<00:04:55.639> from<00:04:55.729> this<00:04:55.849> first<00:04:56.060> episode<00:04:56.180> that<00:04:56.689> they

00:04:57.309 --> 00:04:57.319 
least from this first episode that they

00:04:57.319 --> 00:04:59.619 
least from this first episode that they
don't<00:04:57.889> want<00:04:58.099> to<00:04:58.219> blow<00:04:58.400> up<00:04:58.580> the<00:04:58.610> scale<00:04:58.939> of<00:04:59.210> that

00:04:59.619 --> 00:04:59.629 
don't want to blow up the scale of that

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:02.230 
don't want to blow up the scale of that
narrative<00:04:59.840> too<00:05:00.169> much<00:05:00.349> which<00:05:01.129> is<00:05:01.159> yeah<00:05:01.849> just

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
narrative too much which is yeah just

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.420 
narrative too much which is yeah just
very<00:05:03.229> very<00:05:03.379> interesting<00:05:03.979> and<00:05:04.099> I<00:05:04.129> can<00:05:04.159> see<00:05:04.400> a

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
very very interesting and I can see a

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.369 
very very interesting and I can see a
lot<00:05:04.729> of<00:05:04.789> people<00:05:05.060> having<00:05:05.389> issues<00:05:06.050> with<00:05:06.199> that<00:05:06.319> I

00:05:06.369 --> 00:05:06.379 
lot of people having issues with that I

to their previous work but to be honest

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.499 
to their previous work but to be honest
this<00:05:18.949> is<00:05:19.129> the<00:05:19.159> best<00:05:19.430> they've<00:05:19.759> ever<00:05:19.909> been<00:05:20.180> for

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:20.509 
this is the best they've ever been for

me I think they've stripped out all the
stuff<00:05:22.129> that<00:05:22.310> I<00:05:22.370> wasn't<00:05:22.580> crazy<00:05:22.969> about<00:05:23.150> in

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:23.539 
stuff that I wasn't crazy about in

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:25.510
