00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
this is kind of cool guess it's just for

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.460 
this is kind of cool guess it's just for
decoration<00:01:56.560> purposes<00:01:57.299> but<00:01:58.299> the<00:01:58.960> downside<00:01:59.170> of

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
decoration purposes but the downside of

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.030 
decoration purposes but the downside of
it<00:01:59.740> is<00:01:59.890> every<00:02:00.520> time<00:02:00.700> you<00:02:00.759> reload<00:02:01.360> the<00:02:01.600> game

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
it is every time you reload the game

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.340 
it is every time you reload the game
it'll<00:02:03.040> go<00:02:03.280> away<00:02:03.720> and<00:02:04.720> that<00:02:04.840> kind<00:02:05.020> of<00:02:05.049> stinks

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
it'll go away and that kind of stinks

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.890 
it'll go away and that kind of stinks
also<00:02:06.250> when<00:02:06.430> you<00:02:06.580> move<00:02:06.820> the<00:02:07.090> items<00:02:07.479> they<00:02:07.750> go

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
also when you move the items they go

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.139 
also when you move the items they go
back<00:02:08.079> to<00:02:08.289> their<00:02:08.439> normal<00:02:08.619> size<00:02:09.099> that<00:02:09.909> kind<00:02:10.119> of

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
back to their normal size that kind of

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.199 
back to their normal size that kind of
stinks<00:02:10.419> too<00:02:10.719> but<00:02:11.469> it's<00:02:12.370> going<00:02:12.549> to<00:02:12.700> fool<00:02:12.939> your

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209
