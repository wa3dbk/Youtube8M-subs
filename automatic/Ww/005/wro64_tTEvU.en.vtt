00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
today we're gonna go over how to keep

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.160 
today we're gonna go over how to keep
your<00:00:03.600> jerk

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
your jerk

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.289 
your jerk
position<00:00:04.710> close<00:00:05.279> and<00:00:05.640> efficient<00:00:06.120> and

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
position close and efficient and

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.089 
position close and efficient and
straight<00:00:06.690> so<00:00:07.230> that<00:00:07.379> you<00:00:07.440> catch<00:00:07.620> it<00:00:07.770> in<00:00:07.830> a<00:00:07.950> good

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
straight so that you catch it in a good

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.890 
straight so that you catch it in a good
receiving<00:00:08.460> position<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.090> stop<00:00:09.360> losing<00:00:09.540> jerks

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
receiving position and stop losing jerks

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.049 
receiving position and stop losing jerks
out<00:00:10.139> front<00:00:10.740> so<00:00:11.460> we're<00:00:11.550> gonna<00:00:11.670> kind<00:00:11.880> of<00:00:11.940> make

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
out front so we're gonna kind of make

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.430 
out front so we're gonna kind of make
this<00:00:12.179> like<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.389> two<00:00:12.599> part<00:00:12.900> thing<00:00:13.230> we're<00:00:13.349> gonna

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
this like a two part thing we're gonna

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.020 
this like a two part thing we're gonna
post<00:00:13.679> another<00:00:13.889> video<00:00:14.070> in<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.370> couple<00:00:14.400> days<00:00:14.759> but

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
post another video in a couple days but

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.790 
post another video in a couple days but
for<00:00:15.780> today<00:00:16.020> all<00:00:16.199> we're<00:00:16.289> gonna<00:00:16.410> be<00:00:16.560> worried

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
for today all we're gonna be worried

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.260 
for today all we're gonna be worried
about<00:00:16.859> is<00:00:17.100> what<00:00:17.279> happens<00:00:17.609> with<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.940> barbell

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
about is what happens with the barbell

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.290 
about is what happens with the barbell
on<00:00:18.449> your<00:00:18.660> shoulders<00:00:19.050> so<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:20.310> lot<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.119> stuff

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
on your shoulders so a lot of the stuff

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.400 
on your shoulders so a lot of the stuff
that<00:00:21.330> we're<00:00:21.510> gonna<00:00:21.570> go<00:00:21.810> over<00:00:21.960> in<00:00:22.140> this<00:00:22.230> video

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
that we're gonna go over in this video

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.220 
that we're gonna go over in this video
and<00:00:23.269> most<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.480> videos<00:00:24.720> we<00:00:24.869> do<00:00:24.990> probably

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
and most of the videos we do probably

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.900 
and most of the videos we do probably
they<00:00:25.560> all<00:00:25.710> kind<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:25.949> relate<00:00:26.189> back<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.369> one<00:00:26.640> rule

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
they all kind of relate back to one rule

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.670 
they all kind of relate back to one rule
and<00:00:27.119> that's<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:27.869> we're<00:00:27.990> taking<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.349> barbell

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
and that's that we're taking the barbell

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.189 
and that's that we're taking the barbell
from<00:00:28.980> in<00:00:29.220> front<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:30.420> behind<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:30.929> right

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
from in front of you to behind you right

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.659 
from in front of you to behind you right
on<00:00:31.320> your<00:00:31.439> center<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.800> gravity<00:00:32.189> which<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.460> right

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
on your center of gravity which is right

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.940 
on your center of gravity which is right
on<00:00:32.700> top<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:32.969> your<00:00:33.120> spine<00:00:33.420> so<00:00:34.110> anytime<00:00:34.770> we're

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
on top of your spine so anytime we're

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.740 
on top of your spine so anytime we're
doing<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.399> it's<00:00:35.640> all<00:00:35.820> about<00:00:36.030> creating<00:00:36.540> good

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
doing that it's all about creating good

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.930 
doing that it's all about creating good
solid<00:00:37.320> efficiency<00:00:37.950> in<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.219> position<00:00:38.520> and

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
solid efficiency in that position and

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.729 
solid efficiency in that position and
not<00:00:39.000> wasting<00:00:39.510> any<00:00:39.629> energy<00:00:39.719> by<00:00:40.230> separating

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
not wasting any energy by separating

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.920 
not wasting any energy by separating
unnecessarily<00:00:41.550> from<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:41.940> from<00:00:42.899> that

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
unnecessarily from that from that

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.930 
unnecessarily from that from that
straight<00:00:43.290> line<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:44.160> it's<00:00:44.460> really<00:00:44.610> easy<00:00:44.850> to

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
straight line so it's really easy to

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.520 
straight line so it's really easy to
kind<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.210> picture<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.230> can<00:00:46.320> kind<00:00:46.500> of

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
kind of picture this and you can kind of

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.600 
kind of picture this and you can kind of
keep<00:00:46.649> this<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:46.920> mind<00:00:47.010> as<00:00:47.129> we're<00:00:47.280> going<00:00:47.430> through

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
keep this in mind as we're going through

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.360 
keep this in mind as we're going through
the<00:00:48.270> parts<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.629> this<00:00:48.840> in<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.110> video<00:00:49.379> if<00:00:50.100> josh

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
the parts of this in this video if josh

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.040 
the parts of this in this video if josh
holds<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.670> PVC<00:00:50.940> bar<00:00:51.239> out<00:00:51.480> in<00:00:51.539> front<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.809> him<00:00:51.960> like

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
holds a PVC bar out in front of him like

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.830 
holds a PVC bar out in front of him like
this<00:00:52.489> up<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.550> little<00:00:53.699> higher<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.090> he<00:00:54.629> tries<00:00:54.809> to

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
this up a little higher and he tries to

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.240 
this up a little higher and he tries to
resist<00:00:55.230> me<00:00:55.320> from<00:00:55.500> pulling<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.860> down<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.100> front

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
resist me from pulling it down in front

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.490 
resist me from pulling it down in front
of<00:00:56.370> him<00:00:56.489> that's<00:00:57.480> not<00:00:57.719> really<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:57.989> easy<00:00:58.260> for

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
of him that's not really that easy for

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.369 
of him that's not really that easy for
him<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.620> do<00:00:58.829> but<00:00:59.190> if<00:00:59.280> he<00:00:59.370> holds<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.730> in<00:00:59.850> tight

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
him to do but if he holds it in tight

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.450 
him to do but if he holds it in tight
it's<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.500> whole<00:01:01.649> lot<00:01:01.800> easier<00:01:01.829> for<00:01:02.280> him<00:01:02.370> to

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
it's a whole lot easier for him to

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.399 
it's a whole lot easier for him to
resist<00:01:02.670> me<00:01:02.850> pulling<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.239> down<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:03.989> reason

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
resist me pulling it down so the reason

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.050 
resist me pulling it down so the reason
for<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.890> because<00:01:04.920> you're<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.790> strongest

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
for that is because you're the strongest

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.969 
for that is because you're the strongest
the<00:01:06.510> closer<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:06.930> are<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.080> your<00:01:07.200> spine<00:01:07.560> every

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
the closer you are to your spine every

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.859 
the closer you are to your spine every
inch<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.490> separate<00:01:09.030> from<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.210> you're

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
inch that you separate from that you're

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.660 
inch that you separate from that you're
losing<00:01:10.290> strength<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.890> therefore<00:01:11.010> especially

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
losing strength and therefore especially

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.710 
losing strength and therefore especially
when<00:01:11.790> we're<00:01:11.909> talking<00:01:12.000> about<00:01:12.119> going<00:01:12.330> overhead

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
when we're talking about going overhead

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.660 
when we're talking about going overhead
you're<00:01:12.990> gonna<00:01:13.110> be<00:01:13.290> losing<00:01:13.439> efficiency<00:01:13.830> so

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
you're gonna be losing efficiency so

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.160 
you're gonna be losing efficiency so
josh<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:14.850> gonna<00:01:15.119> take<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.390> bar<00:01:15.540> out<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:15.960> his

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
josh is gonna take the bar out in his

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.370 
josh is gonna take the bar out in his
front<00:01:16.710> rack<00:01:16.860> position<00:01:17.310> now<00:01:18.240> from<00:01:18.570> here<00:01:18.960> if<00:01:19.140> you

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
front rack position now from here if you

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.340 
front rack position now from here if you
look<00:01:19.650> at<00:01:19.860> his<00:01:20.490> heel<00:01:20.909> his<00:01:21.600> hip<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.140> his

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
look at his heel his hip and his

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.469 
look at his heel his hip and his
shoulder<00:01:22.799> that's<00:01:23.520> in<00:01:23.700> one<00:01:23.939> straight<00:01:24.420> line

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
shoulder that's in one straight line

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.170 
shoulder that's in one straight line
going<00:01:25.200> straight<00:01:25.350> up<00:01:25.830> over<00:01:26.100> his<00:01:26.250> midline<00:01:26.670> so

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
going straight up over his midline so

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.289 
going straight up over his midline so
anything<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.659> he<00:01:27.960> does<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.470> separates

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
anything that he does that separates

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.060 
anything that he does that separates
forward<00:01:30.299> or<00:01:30.540> even<00:01:30.570> backward<00:01:31.320> from<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.829> line

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
forward or even backward from that line

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.859 
forward or even backward from that line
is<00:01:32.310> gonna<00:01:32.400> make<00:01:32.670> him<00:01:32.850> not<00:01:33.060> very<00:01:33.299> strong<00:01:33.630> or

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
is gonna make him not very strong or

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.120 
is gonna make him not very strong or
efficient<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.530> dip-drive

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
efficient in that dip-drive

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.920 
efficient in that dip-drive
and<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.790> first<00:01:36.030> problem<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.420> we<00:01:36.540> see<00:01:36.780> people

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
and the first problem that we see people

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.039 
and the first problem that we see people
having<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.590> taking<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.780> forward<00:01:39.780> lean<00:01:40.020> a

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
having is taking a forward lean a

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.319 
having is taking a forward lean a
forward<00:01:40.650> momentum<00:01:40.829> when<00:01:41.700> ideally<00:01:42.180> we're

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
forward momentum when ideally we're

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.580 
forward momentum when ideally we're
going<00:01:42.540> straight<00:01:42.840> out<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.140> heels<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.500> what

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
going straight out of the heels and what

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.109 
going straight out of the heels and what
that<00:01:43.710> means<00:01:43.829> is<00:01:44.009> either<00:01:44.159> pushing<00:01:44.670> out<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:45.030> the

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
that means is either pushing out of the

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.149 
that means is either pushing out of the
balls<00:01:45.329> of<00:01:45.479> their<00:01:45.570> feet<00:01:45.630> or<00:01:45.990> even<00:01:46.110> worse<00:01:46.409> out<00:01:46.950> of

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
balls of their feet or even worse out of

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.920 
balls of their feet or even worse out of
their<00:01:47.250> toes<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:47.820> really<00:01:48.479> quickly<00:01:48.659> we're<00:01:48.840> gonna

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
their toes so really quickly we're gonna

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.560 
their toes so really quickly we're gonna
show<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.439> video<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.640> Josh<00:01:50.909> doing<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.329> jerk

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
show you a video of Josh doing a jerk

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.480 
show you a video of Josh doing a jerk
from<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.780> balls<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.229> his<00:01:52.320> feet<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:53.070> the

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
from the balls of his feet and the

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.800 
from the balls of his feet and the
biggest<00:01:54.000> thing<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.180> want<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.390> keep<00:01:54.509> in<00:01:54.659> mind

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
biggest thing you want to keep in mind

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.510 
biggest thing you want to keep in mind
and<00:01:55.020> pay<00:01:55.140> attention<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.829> position<00:01:56.369> of

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
and pay attention to is the position of

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.700 
and pay attention to is the position of
his<00:01:56.640> shoulder<00:01:57.030> his<00:01:57.509> hip<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.049> his<00:01:58.110> heel<00:01:58.500> in

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
his shoulder his hip and his heel in

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.310 
his shoulder his hip and his heel in
relation<00:01:59.610> to<00:02:00.000> where<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.329> bar<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.719> going<00:02:01.110> as

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
relation to where that bar is going as

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:15.600 
relation to where that bar is going as
he<00:02:01.560> dips<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.159> drives

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.190 

all<00:02:16.610> right<00:02:16.730> as<00:02:16.880> you<00:02:16.910> can<00:02:17.150> see<00:02:17.360> his<00:02:17.569> jerk

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
all right as you can see his jerk

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.900 
all right as you can see his jerk
everything<00:02:18.770> was<00:02:18.890> forward<00:02:19.250> in<00:02:19.340> it<00:02:19.459> he<00:02:19.610> dipped

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
everything was forward in it he dipped

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.610 
everything was forward in it he dipped
into<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.180> balls<00:02:20.569> of<00:02:20.720> his<00:02:20.780> feet<00:02:20.840> and<00:02:21.170> he<00:02:21.380> drove

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
into the balls of his feet and he drove

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.170 
into the balls of his feet and he drove
from<00:02:21.739> the<00:02:21.860> balls<00:02:22.040> of<00:02:22.160> his<00:02:22.250> feet<00:02:22.310> so<00:02:22.970> there's<00:02:23.120> a

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
from the balls of his feet so there's a

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.210 
from the balls of his feet so there's a
really<00:02:23.390> simple<00:02:23.780> cue<00:02:24.080> that<00:02:24.709> a<00:02:24.739> lot<00:02:24.920> of<00:02:24.950> people

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
really simple cue that a lot of people

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.680 
really simple cue that a lot of people
use<00:02:25.370> to<00:02:25.550> fix<00:02:25.760> that<00:02:25.880> problem<00:02:26.239> which<00:02:26.360> is<00:02:26.480> just

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
use to fix that problem which is just

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.780 
use to fix that problem which is just
stay<00:02:26.870> in<00:02:26.989> your<00:02:27.020> heels<00:02:27.380> but<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.310> problem<00:02:28.670> with

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
stay in your heels but the problem with

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.040 
stay in your heels but the problem with
that<00:02:28.819> and<00:02:29.060> that<00:02:29.150> we<00:02:29.239> see<00:02:29.420> happened<00:02:29.750> a<00:02:29.810> lot<00:02:29.930> of

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
that and that we see happened a lot of

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.449 
that and that we see happened a lot of
times<00:02:30.230> in<00:02:30.380> here<00:02:30.530> is<00:02:30.620> that<00:02:30.739> everyone<00:02:31.099> will<00:02:31.250> dip

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
times in here is that everyone will dip

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.130 
times in here is that everyone will dip
really<00:02:31.790> well<00:02:31.940> in<00:02:32.060> their<00:02:32.180> heels<00:02:32.420> but<00:02:33.019> then

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
really well in their heels but then

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.509 
really well in their heels but then
they'll<00:02:33.290> always<00:02:33.440> revert<00:02:33.890> back<00:02:34.099> to<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.370> balls

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
they'll always revert back to the balls

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.550 
they'll always revert back to the balls
of<00:02:34.640> their<00:02:34.730> feet<00:02:34.790> as<00:02:35.090> they<00:02:35.300> drive<00:02:35.569> which<00:02:36.319> kind

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
of their feet as they drive which kind

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.839 
of their feet as they drive which kind
of<00:02:36.590> goes<00:02:36.739> into<00:02:36.920> human<00:02:37.250> nature<00:02:37.280> a<00:02:37.489> little<00:02:37.700> bit<00:02:37.819> I

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
of goes into human nature a little bit I

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.610 
of goes into human nature a little bit I
think<00:02:38.000> that<00:02:38.269> as<00:02:38.420> we<00:02:38.510> think<00:02:38.840> about<00:02:39.050> jumping<00:02:39.349> we

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
think that as we think about jumping we

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.380 
think that as we think about jumping we
think<00:02:39.769> about<00:02:39.860> forward<00:02:40.250> momentum<00:02:40.489> but<00:02:41.239> it's

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
think about forward momentum but it's

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.720 
think about forward momentum but it's
important<00:02:41.720> to<00:02:41.780> think<00:02:41.959> about<00:02:42.230> this<00:02:42.500> jerk<00:02:43.430> not

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
important to think about this jerk not

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.210 
important to think about this jerk not
necessarily<00:02:44.390> as<00:02:44.510> a<00:02:44.540> jump<00:02:44.989> with<00:02:45.050> a<00:02:45.170> barbell<00:02:45.590> but

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
necessarily as a jump with a barbell but

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.880 
necessarily as a jump with a barbell but
as<00:02:46.430> a<00:02:46.730> pop<00:02:47.209> and<00:02:47.540> when<00:02:48.080> you're<00:02:48.200> popping<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.739> bar

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
as a pop and when you're popping the bar

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.110 
as a pop and when you're popping the bar
really<00:02:49.250> all<00:02:49.489> we're<00:02:49.640> trying<00:02:49.700> to<00:02:49.850> do<00:02:49.940> is<00:02:50.030> get

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
really all we're trying to do is get

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.580 
really all we're trying to do is get
that<00:02:50.239> good<00:02:50.390> pop<00:02:50.600> out<00:02:50.750> of<00:02:50.780> your<00:02:50.930> hips<00:02:51.110> so<00:02:51.290> even

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
that good pop out of your hips so even

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:52.630 
that good pop out of your hips so even
though<00:02:51.650> you<00:02:51.709> could<00:02:51.890> probably<00:02:52.010> jump<00:02:52.430> a<00:02:52.549> little

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
though you could probably jump a little

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.309 
though you could probably jump a little
bit<00:02:52.760> stronger<00:02:53.150> from<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:53.450> balls<00:02:53.630> of<00:02:53.780> your<00:02:53.810> feet

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
bit stronger from the balls of your feet

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.020 
bit stronger from the balls of your feet
we're<00:02:54.920> separating<00:02:55.430> from<00:02:55.580> that<00:02:55.700> center<00:02:55.910> of

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
we're separating from that center of

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.030 
we're separating from that center of
gravity<00:02:56.420> so<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.630> the<00:02:57.140> jump<00:02:57.739> that<00:02:57.890> you're

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
gravity so the the jump that you're

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.130 
gravity so the the jump that you're
gaining<00:02:58.310> you're<00:02:59.239> losing<00:02:59.690> a<00:02:59.750> lot<00:02:59.900> more

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
gaining you're losing a lot more

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.900 
gaining you're losing a lot more
strength<00:03:00.500> just<00:03:00.860> from<00:03:00.980> not<00:03:01.099> staying<00:03:01.489> back<00:03:01.760> in

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
strength just from not staying back in

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.309 
strength just from not staying back in
your<00:03:02.000> heels<00:03:02.239> so<00:03:02.540> really<00:03:02.810> quickly<00:03:02.989> we'll<00:03:03.200> show

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
your heels so really quickly we'll show

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.500 
your heels so really quickly we'll show

your<00:04:18.680> elbow<00:04:18.979> position<00:04:20.109> now<00:04:21.109> again<00:04:21.380> it<00:04:21.500> goes

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
your elbow position now again it goes

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.710 
your elbow position now again it goes
right<00:04:21.769> back<00:04:21.829> to<00:04:21.979> that<00:04:22.100> same<00:04:22.250> rule<00:04:22.700> and<00:04:23.479> kind<00:04:23.690> of

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
right back to that same rule and kind of

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.940 
right back to that same rule and kind of
a<00:04:23.810> good<00:04:23.930> way<00:04:24.050> to<00:04:24.110> think<00:04:24.200> about<00:04:24.530> this<00:04:24.650> is<00:04:24.830> that

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
a good way to think about this is that

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.620 
a good way to think about this is that
you're<00:04:25.070> gonna<00:04:25.159> push<00:04:25.490> the<00:04:25.700> bar<00:04:25.880> wherever<00:04:26.270> your

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
you're gonna push the bar wherever your

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.480 
you're gonna push the bar wherever your
elbows<00:04:26.930> are<00:04:27.080> pointed<00:04:27.470> so<00:04:27.890> ideally<00:04:28.370> when

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
elbows are pointed so ideally when

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.719 
elbows are pointed so ideally when
you're<00:04:28.610> in

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
you're in

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.309 
you're in
that<00:04:28.819> front<00:04:29.089> rack<00:04:29.300> your<00:04:29.569> elbows<00:04:29.839> are<00:04:29.960> up<00:04:29.990> right

00:04:30.309 --> 00:04:30.319 
that front rack your elbows are up right

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:32.049 
that front rack your elbows are up right
here<00:04:30.650> which<00:04:31.129> means<00:04:31.159> we're<00:04:31.460> gonna<00:04:31.520> push<00:04:31.849> that

00:04:32.049 --> 00:04:32.059 
here which means we're gonna push that

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:33.999 
here which means we're gonna push that
bar<00:04:32.300> straight<00:04:33.169> up<00:04:33.349> overhead

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:34.009 
bar straight up overhead

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:36.459 
bar straight up overhead
anytime<00:04:34.789> you<00:04:34.939> drop<00:04:35.330> your<00:04:35.569> elbow<00:04:35.930> that<00:04:36.319> means

00:04:36.459 --> 00:04:36.469 
anytime you drop your elbow that means

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:37.809 
anytime you drop your elbow that means
you're<00:04:36.559> gonna<00:04:36.680> be<00:04:36.740> pushing<00:04:36.979> the<00:04:37.189> bar<00:04:37.339> out<00:04:37.550> away

00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:37.819 
you're gonna be pushing the bar out away

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:39.100 
you're gonna be pushing the bar out away
from<00:04:37.849> you<00:04:38.150> pushing<00:04:38.809> it<00:04:38.870> in<00:04:38.960> whatever

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
from you pushing it in whatever

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:40.789 
direction that elbow is pointed we see

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:42.700 
direction that elbow is pointed we see
it<00:04:40.909> a<00:04:40.969> lot<00:04:41.210> of<00:04:41.330> times<00:04:41.509> in<00:04:41.689> men<00:04:41.870> especially<00:04:42.559> of

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
it a lot of times in men especially of

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.950 
it a lot of times in men especially of
really<00:04:43.460> wanting<00:04:43.759> to<00:04:43.879> like<00:04:44.180> drive<00:04:44.479> their<00:04:44.689> arms

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
really wanting to like drive their arms

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.260 
really wanting to like drive their arms
and<00:04:45.050> their<00:04:45.139> upper<00:04:45.409> body<00:04:45.620> into<00:04:46.099> the<00:04:46.219> jerk<00:04:46.490> but

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
and their upper body into the jerk but

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.119 
and their upper body into the jerk but
the<00:04:47.389> problem<00:04:47.749> with<00:04:47.870> that<00:04:47.900> is<00:04:48.169> any<00:04:48.499> strength

00:04:49.119 --> 00:04:49.129 
the problem with that is any strength

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:50.589 
the problem with that is any strength
that<00:04:49.309> you're<00:04:49.430> gonna<00:04:49.550> gain<00:04:49.879> from<00:04:50.210> using<00:04:50.389> your

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:50.599 
that you're gonna gain from using your

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:52.659 
that you're gonna gain from using your
arms<00:04:51.020> you're<00:04:51.529> automatically<00:04:52.099> losing<00:04:52.550> it

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
arms you're automatically losing it

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:54.249 
arms you're automatically losing it
because<00:04:53.029> of<00:04:53.150> that<00:04:53.270> separation<00:04:53.749> from<00:04:54.080> your

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:54.259 
because of that separation from your

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:57.129 
because of that separation from your
midline<00:04:54.620> and<00:04:55.610> also<00:04:56.389> it's<00:04:56.629> really<00:04:56.689> important

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
midline and also it's really important

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:59.110 
midline and also it's really important
to<00:04:57.199> remember<00:04:57.379> that<00:04:57.529> a<00:04:57.680> jerk<00:04:58.009> is<00:04:58.189> not<00:04:58.610> an<00:04:58.819> upper

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
to remember that a jerk is not an upper

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.600 
to remember that a jerk is not an upper
body<00:04:59.300> movement<00:04:59.809> at<00:04:59.960> all<00:04:59.990> it's<00:05:00.740> a<00:05:00.889> hip<00:05:01.129> movement

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
body movement at all it's a hip movement

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.790 
body movement at all it's a hip movement
and<00:05:01.789> it's<00:05:01.909> a<00:05:01.999> timing<00:05:02.330> on<00:05:02.599> that<00:05:02.629> dip-drive<00:05:03.080> with

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
and it's a timing on that dip-drive with

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.399 
and it's a timing on that dip-drive with
a<00:05:03.830> really<00:05:04.129> really<00:05:04.159> fast<00:05:04.580> change<00:05:04.939> in<00:05:05.120> direction

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:05.409 
a really really fast change in direction

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:07.450 
a really really fast change in direction
where<00:05:06.409> your<00:05:06.559> upper<00:05:06.680> body<00:05:06.979> is<00:05:07.099> doing<00:05:07.339> nothing

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
where your upper body is doing nothing

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.249 
where your upper body is doing nothing
but<00:05:07.669> just<00:05:07.849> supporting<00:05:08.629> the<00:05:08.659> weight<00:05:08.870> when<00:05:09.110> it's

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:09.259 
but just supporting the weight when it's

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:11.170 
but just supporting the weight when it's
overhead<00:05:09.680> it's<00:05:10.370> much<00:05:10.610> more<00:05:10.789> about<00:05:10.939> your

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
overhead it's much more about your

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.179 
overhead it's much more about your
shoulders<00:05:11.629> than<00:05:11.809> it<00:05:11.899> is<00:05:12.020> your<00:05:12.169> arms<00:05:12.529> so<00:05:12.979> don't

00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:13.189 
shoulders than it is your arms so don't

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:14.950 
shoulders than it is your arms so don't
you<00:05:13.520> know<00:05:13.639> get<00:05:13.759> get<00:05:14.089> caught<00:05:14.360> into<00:05:14.539> dropping

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
you know get get caught into dropping

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.089 
you know get get caught into dropping
your<00:05:15.110> elbow<00:05:15.169> so<00:05:15.469> you<00:05:15.529> can<00:05:15.589> really<00:05:15.710> get<00:05:15.919> a<00:05:15.979> good

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
your elbow so you can really get a good

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:18.070 
your elbow so you can really get a good
punch<00:05:16.370> out<00:05:16.550> of<00:05:16.639> your<00:05:16.729> arms<00:05:17.059> think<00:05:17.629> it's<00:05:17.809> all

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
punch out of your arms think it's all

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.629 
punch out of your arms think it's all
shoulders<00:05:18.589> kind<00:05:18.770> of<00:05:18.889> a<00:05:18.949> silly<00:05:19.189> way<00:05:19.339> to<00:05:19.399> think

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 
shoulders kind of a silly way to think

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:22.570 
shoulders kind of a silly way to think
about<00:05:19.759> it<00:05:20.199> but<00:05:21.199> it<00:05:21.319> kind<00:05:21.439> of<00:05:21.499> works<00:05:21.740> is<00:05:21.949> that<00:05:22.129> it

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
about it but it kind of works is that it

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.040 
about it but it kind of works is that it
doesn't<00:05:22.849> matter<00:05:22.999> like<00:05:23.270> how<00:05:23.419> big<00:05:23.689> and<00:05:23.839> strong<00:05:23.960> a

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
doesn't matter like how big and strong a

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.809 
doesn't matter like how big and strong a
tree<00:05:24.319> trunk<00:05:24.529> is<00:05:24.740> if<00:05:24.949> it<00:05:25.069> doesn't<00:05:25.309> have<00:05:25.430> solid

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:25.819 
tree trunk is if it doesn't have solid

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:27.369 
tree trunk is if it doesn't have solid
roots<00:05:26.059> so<00:05:26.569> that's<00:05:26.719> the<00:05:26.839> idea<00:05:27.080> is<00:05:27.169> that<00:05:27.199> you're

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:27.379 
roots so that's the idea is that you're

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:29.409 
roots so that's the idea is that you're
catching<00:05:27.559> the<00:05:27.800> bar<00:05:27.949> with<00:05:28.129> your<00:05:28.249> shoulders<00:05:28.759> not

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
catching the bar with your shoulders not

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:32.260 
catching the bar with your shoulders not
with<00:05:29.599> your<00:05:29.719> arms<00:05:30.080> and<00:05:30.229> not<00:05:30.469> using<00:05:31.009> your<00:05:31.879> elbows

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
with your arms and not using your elbows

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.029 
with your arms and not using your elbows
or<00:05:32.689> dropping<00:05:32.959> your<00:05:33.139> elbows<00:05:33.409> to<00:05:33.560> use<00:05:33.680> your<00:05:33.830> arms

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039 
or dropping your elbows to use your arms

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:36.010 
or dropping your elbows to use your arms
to<00:05:34.099> get<00:05:34.279> it<00:05:34.370> up<00:05:34.459> overhead<00:05:34.669> so<00:05:35.360> a<00:05:35.389> good<00:05:35.779> way<00:05:35.839> to

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
to get it up overhead so a good way to

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.050 
to get it up overhead so a good way to
stop<00:05:36.770> yourself<00:05:36.979> from<00:05:37.129> doing<00:05:37.249> that<00:05:37.580> or<00:05:37.729> even<00:05:37.939> as

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
stop yourself from doing that or even as

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.459 
stop yourself from doing that or even as
a<00:05:38.089> jerk<00:05:38.419> it's<00:05:38.569> really<00:05:38.779> heavy<00:05:38.899> people<00:05:39.169> tend<00:05:39.439> to

00:05:39.459 --> 00:05:39.469 
a jerk it's really heavy people tend to

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:41.110 
a jerk it's really heavy people tend to
let<00:05:39.620> their<00:05:39.709> elbows<00:05:40.009> drop<00:05:40.279> on<00:05:40.490> that<00:05:40.610> dip-drive

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
let their elbows drop on that dip-drive

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.239 
let their elbows drop on that dip-drive
