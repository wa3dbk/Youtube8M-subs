00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.919
 so before us magnitolka from fast 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:10.080
 it was not ordered on aliexpress 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:13.580
 I will not record how it turns on 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.260
 I will say only one thing loads very quickly 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:21.390
 approximately somewhere seconds 15 can 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:24.269
 be 20 tried as the video 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.779
 recorded from iphone tried 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.060
 connect it in mode 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:33.540
 the phone to the radio that is checked 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.020
 iphone checked samsung s 3 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.480
 everything works fine contacts 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.489
 the only problem sucked 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.629
 there is no way to show you now 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.539
 since the mobile is immediately losing and not 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.950
 and does not record sound when connected 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.690
 via bluetooth to the radio 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.510
 that is , as far as I understand the radio tape recorder 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:01:00.620
 automatically intercepts all audio 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:03.629
 phone streams so contacts mean 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.869
 displayed but part until the phone 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.810
 therefore selected nothing is removed in 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.030
 general navigator had to 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.590
 program initially it is nothing 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.130
 did not start required to choose 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.810
 sentences but after the first choice 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:23.180
 the program starts automatically 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.180
 which was chosen from me is navitel 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:31.500
 Yuan poured immediately the last as far as I 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.920
 I thought the last card but go to the site 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.270
 on the vital it turns out that they were newer 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:42.140
 so I pre-updated them 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.140
 I will say right away I am in Germany 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.000
 the radio is connected naturally in 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.979
 home to the car I will 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.579
 connect somewhere in a week and a half 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:57.829
 when i get home so satellites 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:01.039
 for some reason finds 10 but connect to 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:04.969
 three and constantly jumping well I think it 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:08.569
 no matter that is with this problem i think 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:10.009
 Home will not be the more so because the antenna is 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:15.860
 she is connected 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:19.310
 of course no car will be divorced 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.650
 somewhere put there under a torpedo somewhere 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:27.760
 installed do not know the probe think there 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:33.099
 yet still I could not make out why it has not seen 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.099
 Here is the video that was standard 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.209
 Well, I will say right away as at home 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:42.410
 conditions connected no sound nothing 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.610
 I can't check how it sounds, but here 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.390
 switch 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.390
 carriers 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:58.489
 so music well, too , there is no music more precisely 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:01.430
 music is sound no standard songs 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.200
 which were flooded too, go right away 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.440
 automatically start playlist 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.660
 here you can switch from what 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.680
 play from which carrier 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:16.069
 Well, it does not matter so here we have our 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:20.750
 outstanding menu standard cleaner 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:22.640
 so to speak radio radio also not yet 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.720
 opportunities to check equalizer because 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.930
 that someone said on the forum that in 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.130
 certain versions of firmware and mq 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.599
 equalizer settings flashing off 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.450
 need to constantly go to the equalizer 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:37.819
 something under tune as long as possible 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.230
 there is no check especially since it makes no difference 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.780
 the cassette player will be tuned in 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:46.040
 car for other radio stations but 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:49.370
 I will say right away the radio station though the antenna 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.930
 it is not connected constantly on something 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.970
 stops worth regional 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:58.819
 europe and 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:04:01.190
 in my back somewhere on 92 he constantly 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:04.870
 stops mean something cross there 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.870
 there may be something catches 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.530
 both slipped 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.780
 finds nothing oh well with the radio 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:21.650
 we will understand then we have not yet 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:24.310
 disk is burning 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.900
 also check until there is no possibility 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.780
 videodisc some movies I do not 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:33.050
 tried because driving and i hardly 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:42.940
 I will watch something wifi 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:45.980
 no problem finding all these all good 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:52.820
 here are our specifications 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:55.190
 who are interested in a little site format about these 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.520
 firmware ampoules can be found on 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.520
 the forum 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:05.180
 so so so so well what else is interesting 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:08.740
 memory memory and here it is generally not clear 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:15.520
 have internal memory and service memory and 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:18.620
 there is so visby the memory of the whole place 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.970
 inside, I don’t know the memory later 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:26.240
 there is still such a pultik 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:29.480
 not here so that is the way fashion button 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:32.720
 sat at a distance of a meter from the radio 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:38.570
 everything works fine so honestly 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:43.420

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:49.750

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.370
 I went but from here it’s hard to see 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:06:04.189
 Well, let's not wait until it loads right away 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:09.409

 mode we have video playlist video you can 

00:06:19.019 --> 00:06:24.809
 quickly switch something uxa and under the disk

 radio navigation music is great 

00:06:24.809 --> 00:06:27.659
 works 

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:31.159
 I understand this to drive it here 

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:31.159

 increases i.e. the remote on 

00:06:48.329 --> 00:06:52.979
