00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
for the RAM this is a lot of trailer

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.240 
for the RAM this is a lot of trailer
motion<00:00:40.630> it<00:00:40.840> adds<00:00:41.110> up<00:00:41.260> defeat<00:00:41.680> of<00:00:41.920> the<00:00:42.010> tale<00:00:42.220> of

to<00:00:50.290> go<00:00:51.900> alright<00:00:52.900> I<00:00:52.930> realized<00:00:53.410> all<00:00:53.620> of<00:00:53.650> that

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
to go alright I realized all of that

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.920 
to go alright I realized all of that
happened<00:00:54.190> very<00:00:54.310> fast<00:00:54.430> this<00:00:55.240> is<00:00:55.480> hard<00:00:55.810> to

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
happened very fast this is hard to

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.020 
happened very fast this is hard to
demonstrate<00:00:56.530> but<00:00:57.010> this<00:00:57.250> is<00:00:57.460> breakthrough

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
demonstrate but this is breakthrough

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.060 
demonstrate but this is breakthrough
technology<00:00:58.780> and<00:00:59.020> once<00:00:59.470> you<00:00:59.590> see<00:00:59.800> how<00:00:59.920> it

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
technology and once you see how it

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.830 
technology and once you see how it
breaks<00:01:00.250> down<00:01:00.430> you're<00:01:01.030> not<00:01:01.239> going<00:01:01.480> to<00:01:01.540> want<00:01:01.690> to

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
breaks down you're not going to want to

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.630 
breaks down you're not going to want to
drive<00:01:02.110> without<00:01:02.320> it<00:01:02.710> let<00:01:03.250> me<00:01:03.340> show<00:01:03.520> you<00:01:03.550> how

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
drive without it let me show you how

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.730 
drive without it let me show you how
this<00:01:03.760> works<00:01:03.970> we'll<00:01:04.660> do<00:01:04.750> it<00:01:04.780> in<00:01:04.960> slow<00:01:05.080> motion<00:01:05.440> so

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
this works we'll do it in slow motion so

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.560 
this works we'll do it in slow motion so
you<00:01:05.830> get<00:01:05.950> a<00:01:05.980> better<00:01:06.160> sense<00:01:06.520> of<00:01:06.670> just<00:01:07.240> how<00:01:07.270> good

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
you get a better sense of just how good

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.740 
you get a better sense of just how good
this<00:01:07.960> technology<00:01:08.650> is<00:01:09.090> ok<00:01:10.090> as<00:01:10.240> they<00:01:10.360> say<00:01:10.600> in<00:01:10.720> the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
this technology is ok as they say in the

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.540 
this technology is ok as they say in the
movies<00:01:10.810> let's<00:01:11.260> break<00:01:11.470> this<00:01:11.619> down<00:01:11.680> frame<00:01:12.280> by

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
movies let's break this down frame by

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.790 
movies let's break this down frame by
frame<00:01:12.580> because<00:01:13.540> what<00:01:13.690> you<00:01:13.810> just<00:01:14.050> saw<00:01:14.290> well

that happened in Mills of the second I'm

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.270 
that happened in Mills of the second I'm
going<00:01:17.110> to<00:01:17.170> exaggerate<00:01:17.470> a<00:01:17.800> little<00:01:17.920> bit<00:01:18.130> and

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
going to exaggerate a little bit and
