00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 it does not look like that but here it fits 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:08.569
 you do not speak german on me where i know you 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.569
 yes , the water is behind me 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.400
 together and welcome to the 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.690
 cyber games now over always 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.060
 still welcome probably still real 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.160
 on god that one yes i am not 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.019
 alone but it starts with the sud 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.920
 police 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:30.869
 and so you have to pronounce the names 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.940
 and that's why a lot has happened for you 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.620
 I have learned 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.329
 since you do not come out or compare 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.129
 I would help right away 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:45.510
 are you doing right there you are 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.190
 Invisible with me I see people that 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.680
 works great as it is 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.829
 sometimes the sound is just the music 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.930
 back to 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.489
 hello i hear back today but 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.699
 I'm never really invisible now 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.780
 It's not like that, I already had it 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.399
 I think that will happen after a while 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.949
 homie you can not help me somehow 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.070
 raus raus yes that thinks so good the 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.490
 I've had a great time round 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.810
 trying to beat me was very nice 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.729
 so you do not see me but this fits 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.659
 times does not speak German to me you 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:27.840
 desert 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:29.280
 she left valuable what forgotten 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.409
 With the compass he shows here somehow 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.360
 answer type is okay that brings yes 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.600
 then good and i like to sport it 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.600
 looks 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:51.750
 I guess then unfortunately that me 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:55.649
 probably not all people like me 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:59.399
 see you oh so I am I am 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:02.450
 so to speak , the music hinders you 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.450
 did not see the others either 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.580
 then that's a great prerequisite 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.910
 you are walking I was already saying 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.610
 Follow me but that fits is bad 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:22.890
 the locomotive is now full 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:24.599
 handicapped yes is not a team make 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.540
 and then you go when the cell phone and me 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.310
 go here but no matter if someone crashes 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:35.970
 to have her with me over there on his 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:37.319
 by the way, this war in kryta me 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.519

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.099

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.470
 I really was not that one now I see 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:48.060
 the snow i see i only see you 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.260
 not you, that's exactly what you see 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.040
 I think but this seems to be 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.630
 I've been hit by the armor 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.650
 Given I do not understand what here 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.440
 I'm running to type it's real 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.819
 Super 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.880
 Play on the zombies server now 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:08.150
 Again, there is the ips in the video 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.650
 description 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:19.250
 Incidentally, I'm already dead so great 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:19.250
 super willich staggers in your face 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:26.010
 Okay, that's just me you see 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.670
 Do not see me or what I am me 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:32.849
 already dead but now right again 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:36.380
 oh I can now even talk 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:39.560
 Do some action properly 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:42.810
 just type in on no plan 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:47.490
 yes exactly what I for the map is 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:51.630
 now so wild marika wild west 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:56.970
 quite cool and the dare moment 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:57.600
 my head aha who has this travel crate 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.520
 found 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:06.480
 who did you find this secret box? 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:10.350
 can not be respected yet whole 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.090
 four people that means the chances are 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.770
 quite good that I prefer this here 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.940
 win just claim now 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.280
 I should tell you to deport us 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.080
 Again, all are so wet, nothing is full 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.550
 would bring 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.680
 this is not going to go out unfortunately is the 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.360
 Yield in the house with that was so in the 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.600
 corner in there so blogger I have too 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.600
 seen 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:38.190
 logically wants to stay here 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:40.770
 I have to say something already 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.100
 that the new server by zombies have 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.210
 Me, yes 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:48.000
 and I have the feeling that 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.260
 somehow more more convincing in crates is 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.310
 and I 've always been right 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.280
 I have just had a lot ever ne 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.090
 Round played to the test without recording 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.030
 and that I also right at the beginning 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.500
 hard to do and it already has 1 me 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:02.940
 do not know where from but on 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:04.650
 beginning in the box was that the home 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:08.070
 crate've found here I express 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:12.950
 now all buttons all this one 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.950
 fucking music why is constantly back 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:25.920
 kibaki that also go here no hello 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.750
 what are you so find so far to 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.760
 one dies then the round goes anyway 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.130
 only 60 seconds further exactly and 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.220
 then from 15 seconds all is there so and 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.750
 then skin is very tricky here that is 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.520
 mad that he made crazy 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:43.320
 The staircase is easy to get 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:45.270
 not sent even though you do 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.070
 just because I have no armor because that 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.540
 Could be quite right that I am 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.190
 dead now pretty fast am under 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.540
 or and I would now 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.279
 probably kill 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:06:02.389
 That's exactly what he will be 

00:05:54.279 --> 00:06:07.089
 Skin be together so good 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:09.829
 question is right I think it is a skin 

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:12.259
 I do not think there are any breasts at all 

00:06:09.829 --> 00:06:15.019
 that was a great round in the principle 

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:16.159
 Everything works just fine 

00:06:15.019 --> 00:06:17.419
 I would imagine 

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:19.749
 Of course you can still do it right now 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:28.479
 epic the fight between us 

00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:33.889
 Casey 11 and park with a123 very nice 

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:35.329
 is seen as a pickle apple tree 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:35.929
 yes so much at one time he had previously 

00:06:35.329 --> 00:06:40.279
 often so many 

00:06:35.929 --> 00:06:41.869
 and now it starts ddp 

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:43.909
 as it looks like website nature 

00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:45.289
 win stretch diamonds bright that 

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:49.099
 It means someone seems to be one 

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:52.369
 armor and south park won like 

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:55.429
 I said my eyes my 

00:06:52.369 --> 00:06:56.269
 training to baker not consume with 

00:06:55.429 --> 00:06:58.819
 my eyes 

00:06:56.269 --> 00:07:00.589
 yes that was it in any case then too 

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:04.669
 already with this round was very short and 

00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:06.439
 also super successful and what's up 

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:09.409
 Now he completes the lobby 

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:12.489
 namely look at the super-g 

00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:16.329
 over I can pronounce that 

00:07:12.489 --> 00:07:18.259
 exactly the link on video description so 

00:07:16.329 --> 00:07:23.119
 I would say that we are with me 

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:25.989
 always a nice one 

00:07:23.119 --> 00:07:25.989
 saying goodbye
