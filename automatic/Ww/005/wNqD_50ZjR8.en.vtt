00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.090 
fight the Jade guardian starts to cast
petrification<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.110> know<00:01:43.290> he<00:01:43.500> want<00:01:43.649> him<00:01:43.890> to

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
petrification so you know he want him to

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.310 
petrification so you know he want him to
explode<00:01:44.399> first<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:45.600> Jade<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:45.960> cobalt

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
explode first the Jade and cobalt

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.870 
explode first the Jade and cobalt
Guardians<00:01:46.619> energy<00:01:46.950> bars<00:01:47.130> start<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.549> increase

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
Guardians energy bars start to increase

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.710 
Guardians energy bars start to increase
because<00:01:48.060> they're<00:01:48.360> close<00:01:48.509> together

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.149 

you<00:01:51.720> don't<00:01:51.960> want<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.200> cobalt<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.649> explode<00:01:52.979> yet

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
you don't want the cobalt to explode yet

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.039 
you don't want the cobalt to explode yet
so<00:01:53.369> around<00:01:53.640> halfway<00:01:54.030> through<00:01:54.390> your<00:01:54.780> tanks

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
so around halfway through your tanks

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.539 
so around halfway through your tanks
we'll<00:01:55.170> swap<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.560> cobalt<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.009> amethyst<00:01:56.369> mobs

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
we'll swap the cobalt and amethyst mobs

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.800 
we'll swap the cobalt and amethyst mobs
around<00:01:58.549> now<00:01:59.549> amethyst<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.360> Jade<00:02:00.539> are<00:02:00.570> both

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
around now amethyst and Jade are both

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.810 
around now amethyst and Jade are both
increasing<00:02:01.200> but<00:02:01.740> because<00:02:02.009> Jade<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.430> so<00:02:02.610> far

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
increasing but because Jade is so far

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.850 
increasing but because Jade is so far
ahead<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.390> will<00:02:03.509> explode<00:02:03.780> first<00:02:06.560> so<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.649> Jade

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
ahead it will explode first so the Jade

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.290 
ahead it will explode first so the Jade
explodes<00:02:08.280> but<00:02:08.580> because<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:08.940> have<00:02:09.090> Jade

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
explodes but because you have Jade

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.059 
explodes but because you have Jade
petrification<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:10.200> explosion<00:02:10.619> barely<00:02:10.950> does

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
petrification the explosion barely does

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.160 
petrification the explosion barely does
any<00:02:11.250> damage<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.700> your<00:02:11.730> rate<00:02:11.940> at<00:02:12.060> all<00:02:14.900> so<00:02:15.900> a<00:02:15.930> few

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
any damage to your rate at all so a few

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.690 
any damage to your rate at all so a few
seconds<00:02:16.500> later<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.860> amethyst<00:02:17.310> gardening

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
seconds later the amethyst gardening

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.979 
seconds later the amethyst gardening
starts<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.090> cast<00:02:18.239> petrification

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
starts to cast petrification

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.930

he's already in the hug and is the

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
highest on energy so you'll know he'll

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.620 
highest on energy so you'll know he'll
explode<00:02:22.799> next<00:02:23.250> this<00:02:23.760> means<00:02:24.030> your<00:02:24.180> tanks<00:02:24.450> don't

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
explode next this means your tanks don't

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.750 
explode next this means your tanks don't
need<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:24.989> swap<00:02:25.200> at<00:02:25.350> all<00:02:25.530> if<00:02:26.190> it<00:02:26.430> had<00:02:26.519> been<00:02:26.670> the
