00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 Welcome to this video us 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.069
 look a really cool today 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.649
 radio app 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.090
 this changed and for ios gives 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.010
 radio is the whole actually 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.849
 not fair because what audi offers us 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.679
 is actually more than just one 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.089
 simple radio app there is one 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.490
 free and a paid 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.750
 Variation where the differences are and 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.650
 you will learn much more on the other 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.650
 side of the intro 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.110
 right here is my audis pro app 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.180
 really a lot of functionality 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.400
 has to show off completely 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.200
 small with the base program at what also 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.809
 still the free version could and that 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.100
 is just a radio app and it is 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.900
 since there is a car-one in yourself 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.879
 unbelievable when we send 62 1653 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.040
 should be something for everyone 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.239
 You can also do it very well 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.010
 you can filter for example 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.480
 it's actually a favorite 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.120
 I want to use because I like new ones 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.479
 blanket you can hear local radios 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.519
 or very important year filter and there 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:05.070
 is there really enough going on for 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:06.870
 you are guaranteed to be there or not 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.190
 to countries because they are in the times 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.570
 vacation in the country and I may still wait 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.310
 want to take a quick look the 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.020
 want to have a holiday feeling back then 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.369
 are you in the right place here? 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.470
 you just sit down and 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.000
 I discover something new at the moment 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.890
 I like the local radio in the air 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.659
 I like working because I am there 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.369
 Have a nice time where I have to go in Rome 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.880
 I'm on the radio from back 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.280
 recall 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.260
 and I just like to hear it 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.130
 I think I can get you in now 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.790
 legally not really the music here 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.610
 show or 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.410
 play before that because of youtube else 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.180
 and will be sued 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.740
 That's why I'll let that be but 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.720
 an important information maybe 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.140
 the whole thing through an internet radio 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.090
 it consumes 57 megabytes per hour 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.830
 if you hear here if wlan is it 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.360
 Of course, no problem but only if 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.330
 now also use mobile volt and 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.670
 Do the smallest you know then 57 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.590
 megabyte per hour , we come to now 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.720
 the features that make this app special 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.730
 we have here for example 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.500
 alarm clock you can with which 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.240
 radio station we wake up when 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.550
 I want to say this 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.200
 I do not quite trust the function 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.000
 relatively buggy yet I hope there comes 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.040
 you update that all really synonymous 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.959
 stable but a function runs 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.290
 works great and I am very 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.150
 likes is the timer function namely 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.980
 I can hear radio here now if I can 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.400
 someday, radio 1 will do it 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.959
 want 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.909
 because important that the wheel the whole 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.860
 night over plays but that 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:31.440
 someday stops and then I can 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.510
 Just click here to press more and the one 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.700
 sleep home use function and 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.830
 choose what time of the local 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.010
 clubs off works great 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.750
 that the only criticism throwers 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.430
 that here between one and 15 minutes 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.840
 I would like to have ten minutes 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.030
 option maybe in five minutes option 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.129
 but mostly quiet for so long 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.140
 So fall asleep for me that fits me 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.329
 choose as well as 20 minutes off and 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.450
 hopefully not until then 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:55.810
 fell asleep 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.370
 but now to the things that really 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.280
 Sensationally cool and you can 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.409
 to be able to absorb things here completely 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.810
 automatically fully automated 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:07.400
 we'll have to go that's it already 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.709
 Rein the app and you can 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.420
 to wish music can be met 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.340
 you can choose from which 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.140
 artist wants to listen to music 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.560
 So you enter the artist here 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:21.200
 you would like to have and then you can 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.819
 still choose how many songs one 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.849
 So you want to go here 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.409
 example 20 ask three children and 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.599
 still choose how many radio stations 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:31.400
 should be recorded automatically 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.989
 So you can do a lot at once 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.409
 unless you are clearly not in now 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.459
 wireless Internet access 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:36.650
 then maybe the whole thing 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.540
 Bandwidth go away at once but me 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.250
 I'm in wlan so I can 20 songs here 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.409
 from drake to 5 radio stations 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.239
 can simultaneously record what it 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:45.980
 I do not know and here again the 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.599
 note if now thinks but it is 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.400
 it's probably illegal no 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:51.349
 funny way you can not in 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.359
 germany radio music easy 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:55.160
 record as long as it is only for private 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:58.400
 purposes is perhaps the love here 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.989
 so read is absolutely legal and 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.319
 one presses on it and now 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:05.449
 the app automatically scans thousands 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.699
 from radio are around the world and 

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:09.190
 takes trade back to work 

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:12.560
 also perfect 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.449
 if you have no artist but one 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.880
 genre what you might want to record 

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:18.380
 then you can just house yourself here 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.660
 Add hiphop leader to the songs 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.310
 let's work just as easy 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.400
 press states and it saves you 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.020
 your favorite songs from now on 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.690
 we are at my pc and look us 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.580
 the free audio slide software 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.500
 the cool thing is you can of course 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.570
 First listen to the radio on the app 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.490
 also and there is also television here 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.860
 podcast offers you can only as 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.139
 but it shows little because of 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.419
 a special function and indeed can 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.130
 Get a free audios account 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.830
 I'm here with that 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:51.400
 logged in software and also in the 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.540
 app and although I can now 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.450
 mp3 is only mine 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.160
 pc i hear on my phone i pull 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.920
 just here in the audio software 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.050
 copy them to the collection and 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.810
 then I can just stay in the app for as long 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.530
 my pc online is this mp3 too 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.630
 play 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.490
 So I really like this radio 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.500
 very good especially the music desire 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.120
 I find functions very successful but 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.400
 for that need the paid 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.690
 Variation that I think costs four euros 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.400
 I just link both of mine 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.140
 description box under this video 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.610
 this most sincere mitgeschnittenen 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.680
 Title can be easy to live long 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.480
 Always hear how funny you are and you 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.850
 It could also be a radio station easily 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.170
 if one goes by, record it 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.570
 the program is the next day 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:34.220
 want to listen again okay that's it 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.110
 for this video I hope you have it 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.370
 you almost like it then you can 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.080
 happy to give a thumbs up I look forward 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:42.160

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.160
 until the next video
