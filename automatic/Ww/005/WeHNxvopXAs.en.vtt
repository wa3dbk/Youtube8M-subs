00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
enough to doing that will be doing it

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.619 
enough to doing that will be doing it
such<00:02:50.010> as<00:02:50.159> myself<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:50.700> know<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:51.030> suspect<00:02:51.599> that

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
such as myself you know I suspect that

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.360 
such as myself you know I suspect that
it'll<00:02:51.930> probably<00:02:52.230> take<00:02:52.620> me<00:02:52.680> upwards<00:02:52.980> of<00:02:53.280> an

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
it'll probably take me upwards of an

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.099 
it'll probably take me upwards of an
hour<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.849> do<00:02:54.000> this<00:02:54.239> and<00:02:54.510> you<00:02:54.629> know<00:02:54.750> get<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:55.019> to

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109 
hour to do this and you know get it to

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.050 
hour to do this and you know get it to
my<00:02:55.200> liking<00:02:55.439> but<00:02:55.620> in<00:02:55.919> my<00:02:56.099> opinion<00:02:56.189> it<00:02:56.609> will<00:02:56.849> be

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
my liking but in my opinion it will be

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.369 
my liking but in my opinion it will be
worth<00:02:57.239> it<00:02:57.450> so<00:02:57.750> that's<00:02:57.930> all<00:02:58.049> the<00:02:58.079> information

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379
