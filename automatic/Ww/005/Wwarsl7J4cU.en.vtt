00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 already in antiquity women fought 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.819
 with unwanted gray hair 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.500
 they used tweezers and in ancient times 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.900
 rome a special thread that came 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.639
 rolled up on the hair to escape for a 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.980
 long and painful procedure 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.080
 today everything is easier and faster 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.710
 especially painless if we talk about the 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.660
 schwerin 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.760
 our expert explains to us in 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.740
 detail this technique to date in the 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.289
 depilation with sugar as in 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.550
 other techniques need to first treat the 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:37.890
 pilar area and in this case we will do the 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:40.110
 armpits and legs need to disinfect 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.410
 hands before treating the area with 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.350
 inter specific people 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:52.110
 let's start only with water let's raise the 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:56.370
 important arms always ask the 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.660
 customer if he put deodorant or creams e 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.340
 immediately after we start the treatment 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.710
 this thing must be stated sometimes it can 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.130
 there is some cream on the legs or something else 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.570
 that may interfere with sugar in 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.140
 in the treatment that will precede the 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.540
 IP hair removal should be raised to 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.330
 example if they grow in this direction 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.479
 we will have to mess them up so that they don't 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:25.520
 they remain attached and I know cicchino 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.520
 bend your legs on your knees 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.390
 we repeat the treatment first only with 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.700
 water 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.560
 we check if there are for and on the fingers 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.439
 we control everything with extreme 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.119
 attention second phase 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.520
 take another towel with 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.399
 professional antiseptic cleaner ad 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.649
 I degreasing effect unlike 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.049
 others a step immediately cleanser on 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.360
 body if we are in the summer on the bond 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.579
 there may be dust or debris 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.890
 of clothing the detergent in of 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.079
 seteco dries by itself but anyway 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.660
 better to pass a towel to be 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:04.300
 sure the surface is true 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.280
 tyco I'll show you how it applies to 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.410
 sometimes I see how to use talc in one way 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.730
 completely wrong if we put it 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:15.310
 too much we would have the necessary adherence 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.410
 we wear special gloves must 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.630
 be adherent like a second skin 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.650
 now we're going to get the pasta for 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.800
 our work 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.990
 first I look at my clients 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.120
 look at what kind of aa batteries and what 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.160
 wants to do in order to decide the 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:36.310
 amount of sugar needed for 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:39.940
 depilation the hand should not be immersed yes 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:43.380
 takes of the center of the jar for i 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.030
 mustache we will not take so many 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.220
 these quantities will not suffice 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.620
 only for the mustache but also for the 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:57.190
 eyebrows for chin hair and 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:03:01.050
 cheek if we take a little more there 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.050
 enough for the whole face and underarms 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.040
 with a quantity of 30 grams more or less 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.290
 the size of a large plum 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:17.360
 we could repeat to peel the face 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.360
 armpits and complete underwear 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.690
 Now the main thing and observe the 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.200
 direction of the growth of pelÃ¨ and la 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.030
 most comfortable position to work in 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.750
 in this case the point grows in this 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.080
 direction 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.970
 therefore my hand will have to follow him and inu 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.530
 I'll have to position myself exactly 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:42.270
 on the other side of the cot we can 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.330
 ask the client to cooperate 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.880
 holding the pens tight to facilitate 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.770
 the movement but in our case it is not 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.410
 absolutely necessary 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.600
 watch the issue here the most 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.970
 important to follow the 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.370
 hair crash direction 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.740
 now for example I like to work 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.580
 from behind because some hair grows from 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.580
 that part 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:09.050
 in the opposite direction to me it is always 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.050
 better to start from the end 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.680
 speaking of the difficulties of the 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.199
 procedure the procedure is not at all 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.840
 difficult if the hand is well set 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:37.910
 sure that after 20 reports it will be 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.699
 much easier than the first one 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.940
 time and so in everything we do 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:46.180
 the first time is always difficult enough 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:49.370
 practice neither more nor less 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.840
 an important thing is to start the way 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.970
 quite right 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.520
 in many countries this technique is 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.889
 developed not only because it is comfortable 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:01.130
 for customers but also because a lot 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:03.500
 comfortable for the beautician the movement starts 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:06.710
 from the comitus unlike waxing 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.690
 the card remains straight therefore it is one 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.770
 technical lair from under many points of 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.289
 view 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.960
 the body nov in overloaded as with 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:17.620
 waxing is all a matter of 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.620
 practice 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.640
 on the legs 21 made of strips that 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.880
 then they will all come with rapid movements 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.830
 frequent on several occasions because it 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.200
 let's make 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:39.180
 I repeat to keep the skin elastic and 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.180
 stimulate blood circulation 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:44.350
 when you have experienced you can 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.510
 take a bigger ball than that 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.650
 you will apply from the beginning to the end of 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.450
 leg 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.570
 excluding the knees you make a 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:54.760
 part then just a little more ball 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.070
 big that long net up to make her one 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.200
 strip with a ball of these 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:02.290
 size we can only get up 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:04.480
 here I can extend it a little but 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:07.690
 however it will have to maintain this thickness 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:10.450
 and maize miliary a chewing gum i 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:12.400
 pledges have to face if we want that 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:15.040
 the customer does not feel sensation 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.790
 annoying well must be immersed 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:20.590
 in the mixture and should not be pulled 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.690
 with experience and practice if I can 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:25.780
 for example make a strip of this 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:27.520
 very thick but I repeat myself and it 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.830
 I show only for those who must 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.290
 perfect the technique not for who it is 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:35.080
 at the first experiences we split it 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:40.720
 simply in this way but it is alone 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:42.850
 for those who look for speed, who says that 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:46.470
 hair removal with sugar paste yes 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:46.470
 loosens about unfounded things 

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:51.880
 sharing is a painless technique 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:54.490
 irritates the skin and does it in game bags e 

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:57.070
 Peeling hair removal with 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:59.710
 sugar is very cheap it seems that 

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:01.660
 this typical if ideal but to be able to 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:05.200
 enjoy all these advantages 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:07.780
 you must therefore rely on an expert 

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.400
 I have to kill trusted specialists in 

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.940
 able to guarantee a result 

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.940
 perfect
