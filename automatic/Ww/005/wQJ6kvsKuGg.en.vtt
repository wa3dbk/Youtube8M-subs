standard dark world monsters but

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.060

really<00:01:07.290> interesting<00:01:07.820> next<00:01:08.820> tier<00:01:09.030> on<00:01:09.150> 17

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
really interesting next tier on 17

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.670 
really interesting next tier on 17

believe<00:02:25.670> so<00:02:26.670> that's<00:02:26.940> understandably<00:02:27.810> in

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
believe so that's understandably in

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.370 
believe so that's understandably in
there<00:02:28.200> because<00:02:28.500> if<00:02:29.040> he's<00:02:29.570> 2000<00:02:30.570> below<00:02:30.780> or<00:02:31.020> four

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
there because if he's 2000 below or four

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.930 
there because if he's 2000 below or four
thousand<00:02:31.680> blows<00:02:31.830> opponent<00:02:32.310> he<00:02:32.640> can<00:02:32.760> draw<00:02:32.910> two

thousand blows opponent he can draw two

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.170 
thousand blows opponent he can draw two
cards<00:02:33.330> so<00:02:34.140> that's<00:02:34.290> reckless<00:02:34.530> greed<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.220> yeah

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180

that's<00:02:36.360> pretty<00:02:36.540> much<00:02:36.780> three<00:02:36.990> more<00:02:37.170> reckless

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
that's pretty much three more reckless

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.070 
that's pretty much three more reckless

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
are the main which is another staple I

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.480 
are the main which is another staple I
went<00:03:03.840> over<00:03:04.050> that<00:03:04.170> I'm<00:03:04.440> interested<00:03:04.950> he<00:03:05.250> didn't

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
went over that I'm interested he didn't

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.490 
went over that I'm interested he didn't
run<00:03:05.580> so<00:03:06.210> I'm<00:03:06.300> guessing<00:03:06.510> he<00:03:06.810> just<00:03:06.990> wanted<00:03:07.290> to

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
run so I'm guessing he just wanted to

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.330 
run so I'm guessing he just wanted to
get<00:03:07.830> to<00:03:09.200> just<00:03:10.200> go<00:03:10.440> off<00:03:10.470> as<00:03:10.860> much<00:03:11.010> as<00:03:11.190> possible

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
get to just go off as much as possible

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.080 
get to just go off as much as possible
Game<00:03:11.820> one<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.980> he<00:03:13.980> got<00:03:14.100> to<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.310> top<00:03:14.430> 32<00:03:14.880> so<00:03:15.030> I

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
Game one and he got to the top 32 so I

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.810 
Game one and he got to the top 32 so I
guess<00:03:15.270> that<00:03:15.420> worked<00:03:15.570> out<00:03:15.660> for<00:03:15.900> him<00:03:15.960> and<00:03:16.820> his

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
guess that worked out for him and his

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.520 
guess that worked out for him and his
