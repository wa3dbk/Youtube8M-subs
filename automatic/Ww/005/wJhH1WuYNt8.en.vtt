00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
that showed but but we kept a clean

that showed but but we kept a clean
sheet<00:00:49.350> that's<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.920> positive<00:00:50.070> for<00:00:50.489> us<00:00:50.930> and<00:00:51.930> we

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
sheet that's the positive for us and we

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:59.599 
sheet that's the positive for us and we
look<00:00:52.140> forward<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.500> second<00:00:52.770> leg<00:00:58.460> top<00:00:59.460> is

of all miss penalties we've all missed

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.750 
of all miss penalties we've all missed
big<00:01:06.869> mistake<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.470> big<00:01:07.680> chances<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.430> front<00:01:08.670> of

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
big mistake and big chances in front of

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.719 
big mistake and big chances in front of
goal<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.780> don't<00:01:09.960> intentionally<00:01:10.260> do<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.740> you'd

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
goal you don't intentionally do it you'd

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.219 
goal you don't intentionally do it you'd
put<00:01:11.939> your<00:01:12.060> house<00:01:12.210> on<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.659> Tomlinson

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
put your house on it that Tomlinson

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.020 
put your house on it that Tomlinson
would<00:01:13.320> school<00:01:13.590> he<00:01:13.920> have<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.220> but<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.000> think

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
would school he have it but I think

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.910 
would school he have it but I think
that's<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.450> last<00:01:16.049> three<00:01:16.380> or<00:01:16.409> four<00:01:16.560> we've

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
that's the last three or four we've

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.770 
that's the last three or four we've
missed<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.700> think<00:01:18.299> we<00:01:18.360> both<00:01:18.509> start

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
missed so I think we both start

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.060 
missed so I think we both start
practicing<00:01:19.290> them<00:01:19.409> because<00:01:19.680> at<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.860> minute

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
practicing them because at the minute

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.740 
practicing them because at the minute
we're<00:01:20.189> not<00:01:20.280> very<00:01:20.369> good

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.499 

don't<00:01:23.750> make<00:01:23.840> sure<00:01:24.939> not<00:01:25.939> what<00:01:26.060> I<00:01:26.090> see<00:01:26.360> nothing
