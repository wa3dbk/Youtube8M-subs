 extra galaxy 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:31.990
 I searched on youtube and I have not seen 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.300
 what is it 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.540

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:41.650
 I will do it if you follow the steps 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.760
 it's very simple so follow me for 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.670
 it teach the first thing you have to 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.070
 to do is connect your smartphone to your 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.050
 computer 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.750
 once done this has to wait for 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.540
 the computer recognizes what 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.739
 is this the software is going to leave this 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.430
 little window but the only thing you have to 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:03.540
 do is turn off the next next step 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.610
 that is often my computer 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.920
 and on my computer this will come out 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.730
 icon the last one down here that says 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.060
 spokesman media player there we give double 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.590
 we will click out the memory of what 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.930
 We are currently using our 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.450
 phone and there we are going to leave all this 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.870
 series of folios in these folders as 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.320
 we can see movies there we click open 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:31.080
 and we can put a movie 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.460
 a video what we anything 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:37.500
 with photo we want and here in music 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.080
 we open it obviously I already have music 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.000
 but it's very easy once 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.470
 open this folder that will be in 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.390
 White 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.100
 we go wherever we want 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.990
 let's have our music, for example 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.990
 I already have it in my music 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.320
 and once in my music I'm going to put it 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.830
 An example 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:03.730
 is here I'm going to choose this one that says 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:07.350
 track ford I will drag it towards me 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:10.350
 screen and from this we are going to close this 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.350
 momentarily 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.180
 and we're going to drag this one that says 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.540
 transform 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:23.079
 inside this window and it's that way 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.860
 simple already transferred we are going to close 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:28.970
 here 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:31.450
 and now let's see if it was already put in the 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.450
 phone 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.680
 and effectively here is it transformed 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.680
 of fast 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:52.440
 indeed it is necessary to clarify 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:57.530
 that these are the same step that should be 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.530
 with any smartphone that simple 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.260
 if you are not following me on twitter 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:06.890

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.720

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:15.110

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.460
 something new with verizon wilders and also 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.110

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.540

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.060

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.569

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:34.519
