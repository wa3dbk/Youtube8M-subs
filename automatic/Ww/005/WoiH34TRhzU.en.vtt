hosted<00:00:38.640> on<00:00:38.730> port<00:00:40.370> 502<00:00:41.370> 87<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.300> could<00:00:42.480> be<00:00:42.570> any

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
hosted on port 502 87 it could be any

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.410 
hosted on port 502 87 it could be any
list<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.590> 5<00:00:43.950> numbers<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.579> for<00:00:44.820> example<00:00:45.180> i<00:00:45.300> have

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
list of 5 numbers so for example i have

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:53.150 
list of 5 numbers so for example i have
500<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.960> 87<00:00:47.059> so<00:00:48.950> then<00:00:49.950> what<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.489> do<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:52.160> go

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
500 to 87 so then what you do is you go

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.360 
500 to 87 so then what you do is you go
to<00:00:53.190> CMD<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:55.079> Windows<00:00:55.469> 7<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.829> type<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.190> in

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
to CMD so in Windows 7 you type it in

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.790 
to CMD so in Windows 7 you type it in
here<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.879> with<00:00:57.059> Windows<00:00:57.539> XP<00:00:58.020> or<00:00:58.050> Windows<00:00:58.590> 8

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
here and with Windows XP or Windows 8

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.740

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
but since I have Windows 7 I'll just do

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.420 
but since I have Windows 7 I'll just do
it<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.159> here<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:06.119> type<00:01:06.270> in<00:01:06.420> CMD<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.560> make
