00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
then put the character DN out which can

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.340 
then put the character DN out which can
then<00:00:36.149> damage<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.630> characters<00:00:36.989> or<00:00:37.110> maybe<00:00:37.260> even

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
then damage the characters or maybe even

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.350 
then damage the characters or maybe even
the<00:00:37.559> device<00:00:37.800> sometimes<00:00:38.010> but<00:00:38.399> what<00:00:39.270> you're

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
the device sometimes but what you're

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.569 
the device sometimes but what you're
trying<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.629> do<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:39.870> trying<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.110> limit<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.579> the

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
trying to do is trying to limit the the

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.220 
trying to do is trying to limit the the
the<00:00:42.149> interaction<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:42.870> have<00:00:43.050> with<00:00:43.079> these

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
the interaction you have with these

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.630 
the interaction you have with these
devices<00:00:43.530> as<00:00:43.800> much<00:00:43.920> as<00:00:44.010> possible<00:00:44.190> when<00:00:44.550> you're

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
devices as much as possible when you're

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.000 
devices as much as possible when you're
plugging<00:00:44.850> in<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.120> out<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.329> games<00:00:45.860> in<00:00:46.860> an

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
plugging in and out the games in an

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.440 
plugging in and out the games in an
attempt<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.309> try<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.640> maybe<00:00:47.789> preserve<00:00:48.180> them<00:00:48.360> a

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
attempt to try and maybe preserve them a

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.540 
attempt to try and maybe preserve them a
bit<00:00:48.600> longer<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.559> one<00:00:49.710> way<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:50.070> kind<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.340> looked

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
bit longer and one way of kind of looked

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.850 
bit longer and one way of kind of looked
into<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.930> maybe<00:00:52.110> look<00:00:52.379> at<00:00:52.469> getting

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
into that is to to maybe look at getting

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.040 
into that is to to maybe look at getting
ROM<00:00:53.129> images<00:00:53.520> for<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.000> games<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.960> are

one of these so I'll demonstrate it on

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.890 
one of these so I'll demonstrate it on
the<00:02:20.170> second<00:02:20.440> norm<00:02:20.590> at<00:02:20.740> first<00:02:24.060> so<00:02:25.060> what<00:02:25.570> happens

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
the second norm at first so what happens

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:35.610 
the second norm at first so what happens
is<00:02:31.320> your<00:02:32.320> little<00:02:32.580> screen<00:02:33.580> flicker<00:02:34.440> it<00:02:35.440> boots

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:21.550 
the 32x needs to be plugged in so if I
take<00:06:16.240> this<00:06:17.240> out<00:06:17.570> and<00:06:17.870> we<00:06:18.080> go<00:06:18.290> to<00:06:18.680> that<00:06:19.340> and<00:06:20.560> now

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:21.560 
take this out and we go to that and now

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.250 
take this out and we go to that and now
interestingly<00:06:21.980> I<00:06:22.580> know<00:06:23.210> for<00:06:23.570> a<00:06:23.630> fact<00:06:23.840> the

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:24.260 
interestingly I know for a fact the

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.620 
interestingly I know for a fact the
Master<00:06:24.620> System<00:06:24.770> games<00:06:25.100> won't<00:06:25.400> play<00:06:25.730> well

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:26.630 
Master System games won't play well

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.560 
Master System games won't play well
through<00:06:27.170> the<00:06:27.290> 32x<00:06:27.770> so<00:06:28.370> it<00:06:28.700> will<00:06:28.910> play<00:06:29.090> if<00:06:29.360> I

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:29.570 
through the 32x so it will play if I

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.020 
through the 32x so it will play if I
have<00:06:29.750> the<00:06:30.310> cartridge<00:06:31.310> plugged<00:06:31.640> directly<00:06:31.730> into

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.030 
have the cartridge plugged directly into

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.090 
have the cartridge plugged directly into
the<00:06:32.330> multi<00:06:32.660> mega<00:06:32.840> which<00:06:33.230> you<00:06:33.380> can<00:06:33.530> see<00:06:33.680> here<00:06:33.860> or

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:34.100 
the multi mega which you can see here or

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.100 
the multi mega which you can see here or
a<00:06:34.160> Sega<00:06:34.490> Mega<00:06:34.640> Drive

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.110 
a Sega Mega Drive

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:37.870 
a Sega Mega Drive
but<00:06:36.530> not<00:06:36.710> when<00:06:36.890> it's<00:06:37.040> actually<00:06:37.400> plugged<00:06:37.670> into

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:37.880 
but not when it's actually plugged into

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.840 
but not when it's actually plugged into
the<00:06:38.420> 32x

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:39.850 
the 32x

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.360
