00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
whole bunch of new ones but I figure how

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.609 
whole bunch of new ones but I figure how
strong<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:14.910> old<00:00:15.059> one<00:00:15.179> anyway<00:00:15.509> well<00:00:16.379> I'm

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
strong is the old one anyway well I'm

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:17.660 
strong is the old one anyway well I'm
simply<00:00:16.859> going<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.190> stick<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.550> screwdriver

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
simply going to stick the screwdriver

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.700 
simply going to stick the screwdriver
through<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.480> pull<00:00:18.779> it<00:00:18.810> until<00:00:19.470> it's

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
through it and pull it until it's

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.340 
through it and pull it until it's
supposedly<00:00:20.070> breaks<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.970> would<00:00:21.869> have<00:00:22.109> done<00:00:22.230> it

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
supposedly breaks I would have done it

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.689 
supposedly breaks I would have done it
on<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.560> controller<00:00:22.920> but<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.250> don't<00:00:23.490> want<00:00:23.609> to

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
on the controller but I don't want to

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.519 
on the controller but I don't want to
risk<00:00:23.820> breaking<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:25.170> don't<00:00:25.230> want<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.470> do

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
risk breaking it and I don't want to do

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:26.720 
risk breaking it and I don't want to do
it<00:00:25.590> with<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.710> new<00:00:25.859> one<00:00:26.039> because<00:00:26.189> that<00:00:26.519> would<00:00:26.640> be

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
it with a new one because that would be

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.870 
it with a new one because that would be
a<00:00:26.760> waste<00:00:26.970> so<00:00:27.840> let's<00:00:28.650> see<00:00:28.859> how<00:00:29.070> strong<00:00:29.550> this

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
a waste so let's see how strong this

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.690 
a waste so let's see how strong this
strap<00:00:30.240> is<00:00:30.420> exactly<00:00:31.040> you<00:00:32.040> always<00:00:32.219> see<00:00:32.369> online

strap is exactly you always see online

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.030 
strap is exactly you always see online
people<00:00:33.059> are<00:00:33.210> talking<00:00:33.510> about<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:34.530> went<00:00:34.800> flying

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
people are talking about it went flying

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.190 
people are talking about it went flying
out<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.309> their<00:00:35.430> hands<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.120> through<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.719> TV<00:00:37.079> or

out of their hands and through a TV or
something<00:00:37.410> but<00:00:38.149> how<00:00:39.149> strong<00:00:39.540> isn't<00:00:40.500> exactly

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
something but how strong isn't exactly

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:49.069 
something but how strong isn't exactly
hmm<00:00:42.300> pretty<00:00:43.260> strong<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:43.829> far<00:00:46.820> hmm<00:00:47.820> I<00:00:48.079> don't

full<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:10.050> crap

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:18.809 

don't<00:02:17.409> hurt<00:02:17.739> starting<00:02:18.340> to<00:02:18.430> stretch<00:02:18.670> or

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
don't hurt starting to stretch or

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:29.690 
don't hurt starting to stretch or
something<00:02:19.650> let's<00:02:20.650> find<00:02:20.830> out<00:02:21.010> if<00:02:21.099> it<00:02:21.190> was<00:02:26.700> okay

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
something let's find out if it was okay

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.420 
something let's find out if it was okay
I<00:02:29.730> think<00:02:30.270> we've<00:02:30.450> determined<00:02:30.780> that<00:02:31.370> this<00:02:32.370> is

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
I think we've determined that this is

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.870 
I think we've determined that this is
definitely<00:02:32.930> not<00:02:34.460> completely<00:02:35.460> simple<00:02:35.790> to

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
definitely not completely simple to

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.790 
definitely not completely simple to
break<00:02:37.640> I<00:02:38.870> know<00:02:39.870> for<00:02:40.170> a<00:02:40.200> fact<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.530> new<00:02:40.650> one

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
break I know for a fact the new one

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.440 
break I know for a fact the new one
wouldn't<00:02:41.100> break<00:02:41.250> if<00:02:41.460> I'm<00:02:41.610> trying<00:02:41.940> this<00:02:42.120> hard

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
wouldn't break if I'm trying this hard

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.930 
wouldn't break if I'm trying this hard
to<00:02:42.600> break<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.930> old<00:02:43.080> one<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:43.640> again<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:44.760> can

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
to break the old one and again you can

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.440 
to break the old one and again you can
see<00:02:45.120> how<00:02:45.300> thin<00:02:45.630> this<00:02:45.810> is<00:02:45.870> a<00:02:46.550> the<00:02:47.550> cameras<00:02:48.000> not

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
see how thin this is a the cameras not

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.540 
see how thin this is a the cameras not
focusing<00:02:48.990> in<00:02:49.140> it's<00:02:49.290> making<00:02:49.560> it<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.710> fatter<00:02:50.340> than

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
focusing in it's making it a fatter than

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.210 
focusing in it's making it a fatter than
it<00:02:50.700> is<00:02:50.790> but<00:02:50.970> trust<00:02:51.210> me<00:02:51.270> it's<00:02:51.480> about<00:02:51.690> I<00:02:52.220> think

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
it is but trust me it's about I think

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.890 
it is but trust me it's about I think
this<00:02:53.430> it's<00:02:53.610> about<00:02:53.820> half<00:02:54.150> a<00:02:54.360> millimeter<00:02:54.600> thick

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
this it's about half a millimeter thick

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.500 
this it's about half a millimeter thick
so<00:02:55.830> yeah<00:02:56.610> it's<00:02:56.870> not<00:02:57.870> much<00:02:58.110> at<00:02:58.230> all<00:02:59.480> yeah<00:03:00.480> I

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
so yeah it's not much at all yeah I

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:01.880 
so yeah it's not much at all yeah I
don't<00:03:00.840> know<00:03:00.900> what<00:03:01.140> other<00:03:01.320> people<00:03:01.380> are<00:03:01.650> doing

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
don't know what other people are doing

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:02.720 
don't know what other people are doing
with<00:03:01.980> theirs

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
with theirs

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.960 
with theirs
this<00:03:03.240> simply<00:03:03.630> won't<00:03:03.840> break<00:03:04.220> is<00:03:05.220> that<00:03:05.730> rats

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
this simply won't break is that rats

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.729 
this simply won't break is that rats
need<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.240> work<00:03:06.360> out<00:03:06.510> more<00:03:06.660> or<00:03:06.990> I<00:03:07.050> just<00:03:07.530> got
