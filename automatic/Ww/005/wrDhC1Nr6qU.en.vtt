 elder scrolls online community project 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.090
 I want to guild a community with you 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.710
 that is, I will become a guild 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.320
 here in it he found the big one online 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.300
 who could join her personally 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.859
 now you may wonder what you need 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.300
 I have to meet requirements for 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.029
 have or have their age 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.990
 somehow play this way and so much 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.429
 in the end, you do not have to 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.900
 Requirements have the only one 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.910
 Requirements that I have is that you 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.540
 you can behave and you the 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.220
 climb 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.800
 accordingly, reasonably 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.410
 I can behave civilized 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.300
 just look and otherwise there is 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.510
 no salary demands because you can us 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.210
 who join as online five guilds with 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.880
 your complete account every character 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.900
 is then bound to this region were 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.750
 Of course I could do it anytime 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.340
 leave again but you can fight 5 against 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.230
 join with one at the same time 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.940
 complete so it's not like that 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.530
 a character that we with the in 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.499
 a guild side and with others the 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.999
 other guilds or the like this applies 

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:07.530
 it not your fractions 

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:08.490
 bound that means they can anybody 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.520
 play a faction 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.799
 Furthermore, you can also with everyone 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.119
 play race what you want because 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.039
 as I said there are no 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.649
 different server that is there is 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:20.999
 Also, do not ask any problems you ask yourself 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:22.439
 Maybe you have something of course 

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:24.450
 on the one hand, you can contact me 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.100

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.479
 however, have banking and more what 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.219
 can use together and with one 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.299
 can talk a little under and 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:31.740
 Of course, there is, of course, too 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.420
 therefore, with the community guild, too 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.819
 I would like to do so with you 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.899
 Play pvp have the pvp gameplay 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:38.819

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.950

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:42.509

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.829
 with more or with a little or 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.259
 maybe even bigger group too 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.179
 organize in teamspeak and then stop 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.889
 together to make pvp and for 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:51.209
 Keep all these fortresses together 

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:52.560
 to be taken in civil 

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:54.719
 I really enjoy it 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.359
 but and that is the only one 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:59.279
 requirement if you play pvp with 

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:00.090
 do you want the pact just heart 

00:01:59.279 --> 00:02:03.090
 to join 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.719
 that means you should either be dark 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.030
 Eleven play in agony a or a place 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.769
 from edition you have the game 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.900
 Pre-ordered if you order this 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.140
 you can with you 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.019
 The faction of this faction joined the rally 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.420
 means to play with pvp you have to 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:22.250
 march grabs his far can you 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.200
 also like to do to me to have to 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.610
 you can not be packed in just march if 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.959
 Of course you can not do that either 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.359
 like to continue to join in other guilds 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.819
 and basically do what you do 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:33.769
 I hope I like it all 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.930

 curious how he will react 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:44.900
 point 2 you can determine the name 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.430
 that means they can do a bit 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.120
 become grimly creative in the now 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.040

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.829
 or any funny idea had that 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.389
 and then the guild finally becomes the 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.370
 Maybe take your name from you 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:03.560
 yes, I'm curious about what 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.030
 Ideas here are not very special 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.680
 good idea comes here we just go 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.120

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.159
