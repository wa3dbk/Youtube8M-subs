00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.760 
and this way you said you command date
up<00:01:13.000> but<00:01:14.000> some<00:01:14.570> when<00:01:14.870> I<00:01:14.930> first<00:01:15.170> started<00:01:15.530> I<00:01:15.680> said

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
up but some when I first started I said

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.850 
up but some when I first started I said
all<00:01:16.130> that<00:01:16.310> correct

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
all that correct

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.910 
all that correct
it<00:01:18.860> wouldn't<00:01:19.900> steer<00:01:20.900> the<00:01:21.110> command<00:01:21.470> they<00:01:21.619> still

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
it wouldn't steer the command they still

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.640 
it wouldn't steer the command they still
say<00:01:22.160> offline<00:01:24.820> and<00:01:25.820> so<00:01:26.000> then<00:01:26.240> I<00:01:26.390> closed<00:01:26.690> toe

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
say offline and so then I closed toe

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.690 
say offline and so then I closed toe
tools<00:01:27.950> but<00:01:28.250> I<00:01:28.280> couldn't<00:01:28.580> find<00:01:28.700> a<00:01:28.850> fix<00:01:29.090> for<00:01:29.300> it

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
tools but I couldn't find a fix for it

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.730 
tools but I couldn't find a fix for it

but if you right-click and you've run

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:44.560 
but if you right-click and you've run
Pro<00:01:36.740> Tools<00:01:37.390> as<00:01:38.390> an<00:01:38.690> administrator<00:01:43.570> the

Pro Tools as an administrator the

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.600 
Pro Tools as an administrator the
command<00:01:44.960> they<00:01:45.110> work<00:01:45.320> for<00:01:45.710> me<00:01:48.430> still<00:01:49.430> offline

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
command they work for me still offline

00:01:49.610 --> 00:02:18.589 
command they work for me still offline
right<00:01:50.060> now

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.940 

and<00:02:19.079> he's<00:02:19.200> working<00:02:19.469> now<00:02:19.819> then<00:02:20.819> you<00:02:21.030> know<00:02:21.950> you

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
and he's working now then you know you

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:36.640 
and he's working now then you know you
had<00:02:23.069> some<00:02:23.189> new<00:02:23.459> tricks<00:02:24.590> trick<00:02:28.549> no.5

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.660 

create<00:02:37.989> and<00:02:38.989> that's<00:02:39.319> what<00:02:39.530> you<00:02:40.129> gotta<00:02:40.310> run<00:02:40.549> it

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
create and that's what you gotta run it

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.860 
create and that's what you gotta run it
as<00:02:40.819> administrator<00:02:41.620> for<00:02:42.620> it<00:02:42.739> to<00:02:42.860> work<00:02:43.010> right

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
as administrator for it to work right

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.300 
as administrator for it to work right
and<00:02:44.870> I'm<00:02:44.959> guessing<00:02:45.440> it<00:02:45.560> continue<00:02:46.099> working

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
and I'm guessing it continue working
