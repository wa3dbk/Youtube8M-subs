00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.789 
just do it like so and then you get an
iron<00:01:17.729> fork<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.570> really<00:01:18.750> easy<00:01:18.960> really<00:01:19.259> cool<00:01:19.560> and

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
iron fork so really easy really cool and

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.800 
iron fork so really easy really cool and
there's<00:01:20.549> on<00:01:20.759> there's<00:01:21.030> two<00:01:21.240> pretty<00:01:21.479> much<00:01:21.630> like

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
iron one so with a wooden one it will

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.520 
iron one so with a wooden one it will

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
it will not regenerate hunger health

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.390 
it will not regenerate hunger health
well<00:01:33.900> it's<00:01:34.020> just<00:01:34.200> good<00:01:34.350> but<00:01:35.009> if<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.189> hit<00:01:35.310> it

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400

well it's just good but if you hit it
with<00:01:35.490> an<00:01:35.579> iron<00:01:35.790> fork<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.450> will<00:01:36.689> also<00:01:36.900> not

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
with an iron fork it will also not

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.350 
with an iron fork it will also not
regenerate<00:01:37.799> health<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.670> get<00:01:38.820> one<00:01:39.119> heart

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360

blocks over on top of him there's like

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.130 
blocks over on top of him there's like
explosion<00:02:20.610> so<00:02:20.730> if<00:02:20.820> I<00:02:20.880> right<00:02:21.030> click<00:02:21.060> Adam<00:02:21.420> boom

really cool and then I'm sooner or later
you<00:02:26.010> will<00:02:26.190> do<00:02:27.090> it<00:02:27.180> enough<00:02:27.450> oh<00:02:27.690> yeah<00:02:28.620> okay<00:02:29.100> I<00:02:29.130> got

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
a little bit too close but um he would

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.140 
a little bit too close but um he would
soon<00:02:31.980> enough<00:02:32.250> died<00:02:32.520> when<00:02:32.820> I<00:02:32.850> kept

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
soon enough died when I kept

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.450 
soon enough died when I kept
right-clicking<00:02:33.660> him<00:02:33.960> so<00:02:34.890> that's<00:02:35.070> really<00:02:35.190> cool

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
right-clicking him so that's really cool

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.380 
right-clicking him so that's really cool
and<00:02:35.700> then<00:02:37.220> for<00:02:38.220> this<00:02:38.460> one<00:02:38.700> you're<00:02:39.180> actually

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
and then for this one you're actually

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.540 
and then for this one you're actually
supposed<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:40.050> be<00:02:40.110> when<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.070> right-click

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
supposed to be when you right-click

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.340 
supposed to be when you right-click
you're<00:02:41.880> supposed<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.210> get<00:02:42.330> a<00:02:42.450> potion<00:02:42.840> effect

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
you're supposed to get a potion effect

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.080 
you're supposed to get a potion effect
and<00:02:43.590> you're<00:02:43.860> supposed<00:02:44.160> to<00:02:44.250> have<00:02:44.400> blindness

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
and you're supposed to have blindness

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.150 
and you're supposed to have blindness
and<00:02:45.330> then<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:45.840> will<00:02:45.960> teleport<00:02:46.290> just<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.710> random

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
and then you will teleport just a random

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.340 
and then you will teleport just a random
different<00:02:47.580> location<00:02:48.180> when<00:02:48.660> you<00:02:48.690> actually<00:02:48.900> eat

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
different location when you actually eat

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.590 
different location when you actually eat
him<00:02:49.560> so<00:02:49.860> i'd<00:02:49.980> rather<00:02:50.340> i<00:02:50.730> recommend<00:02:51.420> not<00:02:51.540> doing

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
him so i'd rather i recommend not doing

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.080 
him so i'd rather i recommend not doing
that<00:02:51.900> but<00:02:52.530> when<00:02:52.710> I<00:02:52.740> did<00:02:53.070> it<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.400> three<00:02:53.790> times

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
that but when I did it the three times

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.330 
that but when I did it the three times
it<00:02:54.390> crashed<00:02:54.720> my<00:02:54.930> minecraft<00:02:55.440> all<00:02:55.650> three<00:02:56.070> times

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
it crashed my minecraft all three times

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.550 
it crashed my minecraft all three times
so<00:02:56.730> I'm<00:02:57.570> not<00:02:57.720> really<00:02:57.780> sure<00:02:57.930> if<00:02:58.050> that's<00:02:58.230> a<00:02:58.320> bug

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
so I'm not really sure if that's a bug

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.730 
so I'm not really sure if that's a bug
but<00:02:59.190> i<00:02:59.220> reinstalled<00:02:59.940> it<00:03:00.090> three<00:03:00.990> times<00:03:01.260> as<00:03:01.440> well

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
but i reinstalled it three times as well

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.440 
but i reinstalled it three times as well
and<00:03:02.040> it<00:03:02.100> still<00:03:02.430> did<00:03:02.550> the<00:03:02.580> same<00:03:02.760> exact<00:03:03.060> thing<00:03:03.270> so

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
and it still did the same exact thing so
