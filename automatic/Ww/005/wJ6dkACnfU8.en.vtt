you'll actually get oma night which will

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.629 
you'll actually get oma night which will
eventually<00:04:55.370> evolved<00:04:56.210> into<00:04:56.409> omastar<00:04:57.639> now

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
eventually evolved into omastar now

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:03.730 
eventually evolved into omastar now
omastar<00:04:59.120> is<00:04:59.509> a<00:04:59.539> rock<00:04:59.900> and<00:05:00.110> water<00:05:00.349> type<00:05:02.740> now

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
omastar is a rock and water type now

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.869 
omastar is a rock and water type now
actually<00:05:04.039> have<00:05:04.310> very<00:05:04.340> good<00:05:04.849> defense<00:05:06.879> very

00:05:07.869 --> 00:05:07.879 
actually have very good defense very

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:12.129 
actually have very good defense very
good<00:05:08.180> defense<00:05:10.000> it's<00:05:11.000> four<00:05:11.360> times<00:05:11.599> week<00:05:11.930> to

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
good defense it's four times week to

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:17.920 
good defense it's four times week to
grasp<00:05:12.500> but<00:05:12.740> isn't<00:05:13.039> that<00:05:13.069> good<00:05:15.400> but<00:05:16.400> yeah<00:05:16.930> both

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
grasp but isn't that good but yeah both

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.379 
grasp but isn't that good but yeah both
these<00:05:18.139> fossils<00:05:18.680> are<00:05:18.770> at<00:05:18.860> level<00:05:19.009> five<00:05:19.520> and<00:05:20.090> they

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:20.389 
these fossils are at level five and they

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:24.070 
these fossils are at level five and they
both<00:05:20.629> evolve<00:05:20.870> at<00:05:21.500> level<00:05:21.889> 40<00:05:22.840> now<00:05:23.840> in<00:05:23.990> the

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
both evolve at level 40 now in the

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.439 
both evolve at level 40 now in the
original<00:05:24.229> red<00:05:24.800> and<00:05:25.069> blue<00:05:25.430> and<00:05:25.729> yellow<00:05:25.969> games

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:26.449 
original red and blue and yellow games

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:30.040 
original red and blue and yellow games
actually<00:05:27.379> got<00:05:27.680> them<00:05:27.830> at<00:05:27.949> level<00:05:28.219> 20<00:05:29.050> which

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
actually got them at level 20 which

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.040 
actually got them at level 20 which
isn't<00:05:30.259> that<00:05:30.440> bad<00:05:30.560> but<00:05:31.099> level<00:05:31.520> 5<00:05:31.849> I<00:05:32.479> don't<00:05:32.990> think

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
isn't that bad but level 5 I don't think

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.649 
isn't that bad but level 5 I don't think
it's<00:05:33.259> worth<00:05:33.500> it<00:05:33.650> to<00:05:33.710> raise<00:05:34.210> but<00:05:35.210> if<00:05:35.300> you<00:05:35.449> want

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:35.659 
it's worth it to raise but if you want

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:39.790 
it's worth it to raise but if you want
to<00:05:35.870> you<00:05:36.319> can<00:05:37.509> next<00:05:38.509> is<00:05:38.599> a<00:05:38.630> dome<00:05:38.960> fossil<00:05:39.680> and

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
to you can next is a dome fossil and

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.180 
to you can next is a dome fossil and
this<00:05:40.009> is<00:05:40.159> actually<00:05:40.310> for<00:05:40.909> Kabuto<00:05:41.949> which<00:05:42.949> will

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
this is actually for Kabuto which will

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.399 
this is actually for Kabuto which will
eventually<00:05:43.370> evolved<00:05:44.029> into<00:05:44.150> Kabutops<00:05:45.080> now

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:45.409 
eventually evolved into Kabutops now

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:48.450 
eventually evolved into Kabutops now
Kabuto<00:05:45.919> is<00:05:46.159> also<00:05:46.610> a<00:05:46.849> rock<00:05:47.509> and<00:05:47.750> water<00:05:47.930> type

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
Kabuto is also a rock and water type

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.149 
Kabuto is also a rock and water type
it's<00:05:49.460> very<00:05:49.699> fast<00:05:50.240> as<00:05:50.569> very<00:05:50.900> good<00:05:51.259> physical

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:52.159 
it's very fast as very good physical

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:59.909 
it's very fast as very good physical
attack<00:05:55.539> actually<00:05:56.539> liked<00:05:56.750> it<00:05:56.990> more<00:05:57.289> than

00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:03.420 

omastar<00:06:00.919> that's<00:06:01.669> what<00:06:01.849> I'm<00:06:01.940> going<00:06:02.060> to<00:06:02.180> choose

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430 
omastar that's what I'm going to choose

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:08.190
