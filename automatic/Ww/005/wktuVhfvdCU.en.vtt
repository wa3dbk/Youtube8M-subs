one of the 80s comic books or at least a
collection<00:03:30.840> of<00:03:30.930> a<00:03:31.049> lot<00:03:31.079> of<00:03:31.229> the<00:03:31.409> comics<00:03:31.829> that

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
collection of a lot of the comics that

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.189 
collection of a lot of the comics that
had<00:03:32.190> to<00:03:32.400> do<00:03:32.549> with<00:03:32.579> the<00:03:33.000> air<00:03:33.269> strike<00:03:33.720> patrol

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:34.199 
had to do with the air strike patrol

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:38.149 
had to do with the air strike patrol
characters<00:03:34.709> such<00:03:35.489> as<00:03:35.760> um<00:03:36.109> whisper<00:03:37.109> tail<00:03:37.799> wind

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 
characters such as um whisper tail wind

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:40.640 
characters such as um whisper tail wind
storm<00:03:38.819> cloud<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:39.599> I<00:03:39.930> think<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.349> other<00:03:40.530> guy

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
storm cloud and I think the other guy

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.009 
storm cloud and I think the other guy
was<00:03:40.829> night<00:03:41.040> flight<00:03:41.340> I<00:03:41.370> think<00:03:41.849> so<00:03:42.090> anyways<00:03:42.750> it

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
was night flight I think so anyways it

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.500 
was night flight I think so anyways it
had<00:03:43.199> those<00:03:43.440> characters<00:03:44.099> had<00:03:44.579> characters<00:03:45.209> like

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
had those characters had characters like

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.750 
had those characters had characters like
Nightbeat<00:03:46.109> and<00:03:46.530> of<00:03:46.620> course<00:03:46.859> Optimus<00:03:47.400> Prime<00:03:47.729> I

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
Nightbeat and of course Optimus Prime I

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.670 
Nightbeat and of course Optimus Prime I
think<00:03:48.150> Scorponok<00:03:48.750> was<00:03:48.930> in<00:03:49.079> there<00:03:49.229> too<00:03:49.440> and

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
think Scorponok was in there too and

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.159 
think Scorponok was in there too and
some<00:03:50.669> of<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:50.909> pretenders<00:03:51.449> and<00:03:51.479> you<00:03:51.900> know<00:03:51.959> that

the<00:04:18.870> comic<00:04:19.229> books<00:04:19.470> which<00:04:19.949> one<00:04:20.579> would<00:04:20.789> you<00:04:20.849> most

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
the comic books which one would you most

recommend<00:04:21.930> for<00:04:22.260> someone<00:04:22.740> who's<00:04:23.190> starting<00:04:23.639> out

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
recommend for someone who's starting out

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:26.090 
recommend for someone who's starting out
like<00:04:24.330> it<00:04:24.450> doesn't<00:04:24.719> necessarily<00:04:25.380> have<00:04:25.560> to<00:04:25.770> be

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
like it doesn't necessarily have to be

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.770 
like it doesn't necessarily have to be
what<00:04:26.190> you<00:04:26.310> think<00:04:26.580> is<00:04:26.730> the<00:04:26.850> best<00:04:27.060> comic<00:04:27.540> book

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
what you think is the best comic book

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.510 
what you think is the best comic book
because<00:04:28.200> maybe<00:04:28.470> there's<00:04:28.770> a<00:04:28.830> really<00:04:29.100> good<00:04:29.250> one

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
because maybe there's a really good one

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.880 
because maybe there's a really good one
but<00:04:30.210> it<00:04:30.330> requires<00:04:30.780> a<00:04:30.990> lot<00:04:31.260> of<00:04:31.290> foreknowledge

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
but it requires a lot of foreknowledge

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.310 
but it requires a lot of foreknowledge
for<00:04:32.370> you<00:04:32.460> to<00:04:32.580> understand<00:04:33.120> it<00:04:33.330> I<00:04:33.510> mean<00:04:33.720> from

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.660 
what I can get the comic books are a lot
more<00:04:36.480> complex<00:04:37.260> than<00:04:37.440> any<00:04:37.770> of<00:04:37.920> the<00:04:38.040> TV<00:04:38.400> shows

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
more complex than any of the TV shows

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.730 
more complex than any of the TV shows
would<00:04:38.940> be<00:04:39.180> well<00:04:39.630> you<00:04:39.960> know<00:04:39.990> Beast<00:04:40.290> Wars<00:04:40.470> was
