00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.240
 welcome again like in this video 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.430
 I'm going to teach how to make a tree that grows 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.600
 like this one that can be used to decorate 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.960
 to make a Christmas tree what 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.960
 you want 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.640
 part of this tree what we are is 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.910
 a tube to roll all tape 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.480
 adhesive 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.890
 some scissors and then here papers I 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.850
 here I will use a paper that I am 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.960
 recycling 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.880
 that painted it brown for 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.910
 look at making the base of the trunk and 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.710
 then in colored papers in this case 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.720
 green to make as if they were leaves 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.980
 we can do it with any kind of 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.720
 paper we can do even with 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.910
 newspapers or with advertising magazines 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.460
 ok I'm going to do it like that so 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.140
 it is a little better the first thing that 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.300
 we have to do is cut a piece of 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.280
 tape now at the height we want 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.640
 in this case I have the color here 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.100
 Brown 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.690
 and then I have two dark greens first 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.000
 I'm going to put the dark greens and then 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.770
 the light green 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.660
 to put them and you have painted 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.400
 the colored papers in this case 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.880
 I the brown what we have to do is 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.040
 start hooking each one along 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.650
 but behind in such a way that then 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.180
 do not look 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.890
 Adhesive tape 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.890
 we will see here and with care 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.190
 we hook it if there is nothing happens what 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.909
 we put inside 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.829
 and so we fix it better 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.560
 let's do exactly the same with 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:38.790
 the next we take a little ribbon 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.790
 actively up to 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.850
 we put together the two sheets 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.720
 and we hooked them 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.650
 perfect 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.800
 and so we're going to do it with all the 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.800
 leaves 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.680
 very well we already have all the leaves 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.860
 hooked here we see that in the end has 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.330
 stayed like a very long leaf 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.400
 and what we're going to have to do now 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.380
 is to roll up but let's go carefully 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.390
 so as not to start rolling 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.250
 for the brown area we want this to 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.820
 be the outer visible therefore what 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.820
 what are we going to do is 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.989
 they started rolling in such a way that 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.239
 this is at the end and that in this way 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.920
 stay on the outside of the tube so 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.000
 so much what we will do 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.490
 is to start rolling 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.400
 by this end of agreement we 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:47.430
 we will help the tube and start 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.370
 roll up so carefully basically what 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.390
 of the tube we will do it for 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.390
 do it more easily 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.520
 that has to be 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.930
 we remove the tube we store them and now 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.150
 what we have to do is with the help 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.760
 of the fingers putting inside look at 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.470
 tighten the interior a little 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.470
 we will go placing and squeezing 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.020
 the tube done and what we are going to have 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.110
 what to do is catch some tape 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.110
 adhesive 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.940
 about half of a paper and what 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:45.460
 what we are going to do is hook 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.460
 from the one below 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.010
 we hooked here 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.600
 up to half agreement 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.950
 well they hooked more or less to the 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.740
 half and here if there is a little left 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.700
 nothing that we can 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.700
 ends cutting 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.200
 and now what we have to do is 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.030
 cut through the area where we have not put 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.740
 the tape here we have the tape 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.210
 adhesive because we are going to cut 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.400
 here 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.790
 we will make as many cuts as leaves 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.790
 we want 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.870
 more or less we cut up to half 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:33.689
 and here we see how it's going, I'm going to 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:34.919
 cut a little more to have a little 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:37.409
 more than leaves but we have to go with 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.729
 Care where we cut to cut over 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:42.830
 everything what we want I am going to 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.830
 cut this group of leaves 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.750
 our tree and now what are we going 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.750
 and extend it 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.590
 here we see the tree and what we have to 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.590
 do is catch 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:13.090
 of the inner leaves 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.490
 and here we have our ham 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.370
 if we do not want to get here a bit we see 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.730
 how we have put a little humility 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.730
 on the table 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:39.300
 remains 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.300
 perfectly 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:49.060
 good since we have our tree 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.060
 extensible 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.600
 We hope you liked it 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.890
 good since we have our tree 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.230
 extendable as you see ends very well 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:03.000
 we think that it has liked like I said 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.680
 You can do it with many types of 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.200
 papers with newspaper with whatever you want 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.370
 the truth is that it looks pretty and 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.740
 If you want to make a Christmas tree 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.240
 Well, here you can make an idea 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.340
 why 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.690
 the kids will love it with insurance already 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.060
 that apart from what it seemed then 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.750
 extend it they stay very stopped and they were 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.699
 surprised 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.600
 so no hope that those who 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:24.480
 you do 

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.860
 the result very cool well if it has 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.280
 liked all the subscribed to 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.280
 our channel 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:33.830
 we have a lot 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.730
 thank you very much for everything and nothing 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.730
 until the next video
