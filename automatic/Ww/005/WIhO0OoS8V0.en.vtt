hydrogen<00:00:04.450> sensor<00:00:04.690> to<00:00:05.529> check<00:00:05.770> for<00:00:05.979> leaks<00:00:06.160> and

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:07.139 
hydrogen sensor to check for leaks and

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:13.500 
hydrogen sensor to check for leaks and
it's<00:00:08.139> above<00:00:08.500> us<00:00:08.680> here<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.940> that's<00:00:13.240> just

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:13.510 
it's above us here and that's just

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.740 
it's above us here and that's just
little<00:00:13.810> item<00:00:14.080> up<00:00:14.230> here<00:00:14.530> and<00:00:14.740> the<00:00:14.830> ceiling

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
little item up here and the ceiling

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.689 
little item up here and the ceiling
which<00:00:16.750> you<00:00:16.900> can<00:00:17.050> see<00:00:17.230> flashing<00:00:17.830> it's<00:00:18.460> just

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:18.699 
which you can see flashing it's just

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:20.480 
which you can see flashing it's just
starting<00:00:19.060> up<00:00:19.150> and<00:00:19.390> what's<00:00:19.539> it<00:00:19.689> turn<00:00:19.869> solid

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
starting up and what's it turn solid

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.769 
starting up and what's it turn solid
solid<00:00:21.490> green<00:00:21.849> then<00:00:22.060> that<00:00:22.210> means<00:00:22.419> it's<00:00:22.599> active

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:22.779 
solid green then that means it's active

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:24.800 
solid green then that means it's active
and<00:00:23.109> detecting<00:00:23.679> the<00:00:23.800> present<00:00:24.189> if<00:00:24.310> there's<00:00:24.519> any

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
and detecting the present if there's any

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.089 
and detecting the present if there's any
hydrogen<00:00:25.810> around<00:00:25.900> if<00:00:26.289> the<00:00:26.499> alarm<00:00:26.739> goes<00:00:26.949> off

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:27.099 
hydrogen around if the alarm goes off

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.100 
hydrogen around if the alarm goes off
that<00:00:27.159> we<00:00:27.429> have<00:00:27.550> a<00:00:27.579> leak<00:00:28.829> so<00:00:29.829> here<00:00:30.310> we<00:00:30.429> go

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.110 
that we have a leak so here we go

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:42.360 
that we have a leak so here we go
there's<00:00:32.110> now<00:00:32.410> on<00:00:32.649> and<00:00:32.980> measuring<00:00:38.609> so<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:41.370> tank

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
there's now on and measuring so the tank

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.090 
there's now on and measuring so the tank
on<00:00:42.609> the<00:00:42.640> wall<00:00:42.910> over<00:00:43.149> there<00:00:43.420> that's<00:00:44.350> our<00:00:44.620> high

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
on the wall over there that's our high

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.529 
on the wall over there that's our high
pressure<00:00:45.340> tank<00:00:45.789> of<00:00:46.420> hydrogen<00:00:46.859> maximum<00:00:47.859> of

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
pressure tank of hydrogen maximum of

pressure tank of hydrogen maximum of
2,000<00:00:49.539> psi<00:00:49.719> and<00:00:50.699> 19,000<00:00:51.699> liters<00:00:52.030> of<00:00:52.300> hydrogen

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:20.929 

seemed<00:01:04.210> to<00:01:04.330> have<00:01:04.449> some<00:01:04.659> water<00:01:04.960> in<00:01:05.170> there<00:01:05.230> lines

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.249 

okay<00:01:21.939> so<00:01:22.000> what<00:01:22.210> you<00:01:22.330> just<00:01:22.450> saw<00:01:22.689> those<00:01:23.110> it

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
okay so what you just saw those it

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.350 
okay so what you just saw those it
cleared<00:01:23.530> the<00:01:23.590> water<00:01:23.830> out<00:01:24.070> of<00:01:24.100> the<00:01:24.220> line<00:01:24.400> to

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
cleared the water out of the line to

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.539 
cleared the water out of the line to
make<00:01:25.540> sure<00:01:25.689> you<00:01:25.780> don't<00:01:25.869> have<00:01:26.049> it<00:01:27.600> now<00:01:29.520> take<00:01:30.520> a

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
make sure you don't have it now take a

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:41.330 
make sure you don't have it now take a
hydrogen<00:01:30.909> bottle<00:01:34.830> and<00:01:36.840> fit<00:01:37.840> connect<00:01:38.170> Oh

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.170 

look<00:01:42.340> like<00:01:42.549> the<00:01:42.759> third<00:01:43.030> line<00:01:43.330> here<00:01:45.060> one<00:01:46.060> two

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
look like the third line here one two

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.520 
look like the third line here one two
the<00:01:46.299> bottle<00:01:47.610> using<00:01:48.610> a<00:01:48.670> half-inch<00:01:49.149> wrench

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
the bottle using a half-inch wrench

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.570 
the bottle using a half-inch wrench
using<00:01:50.530> a<00:01:50.590> half<00:01:50.740> inch<00:01:50.920> on<00:01:51.130> a<00:01:51.190> 9/16<00:01:52.229> so<00:01:53.280> -<00:01:54.280> CH

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
using a half inch on a 9/16 so - CH

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.289 
using a half inch on a 9/16 so - CH
holds<00:01:55.090> a<00:01:55.500> little<00:01:56.500> part<00:01:56.950> and<00:01:57.789> then<00:01:57.940> you<00:01:58.060> tighten

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
holds a little part and then you tighten

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:11.880 
holds a little part and then you tighten
it<00:01:58.509> up<00:01:58.740> so<00:02:06.060> that's<00:02:07.060> basically<00:02:07.630> it<00:02:07.720> so<00:02:10.680> it<00:02:11.680> has

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
it up so that's basically it so it has

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.789 
it up so that's basically it so it has
your<00:02:12.069> bottle<00:02:12.430> ready<00:02:12.580> and<00:02:13.110> then<00:02:14.110> you<00:02:14.470> lay<00:02:14.680> it

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
your bottle ready and then you lay it

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:19.340 
your bottle ready and then you lay it
down<00:02:14.830> into<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.640> water<00:02:16.470> to<00:02:17.470> check<00:02:17.709> for<00:02:17.890> leaks

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
down into the water to check for leaks

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.509 
down into the water to check for leaks
welcome<00:02:20.350> over<00:02:20.470> here<00:02:20.799> and<00:02:21.040> one<00:02:21.130> good<00:02:21.250> look<00:02:21.400> at

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
welcome over here and one good look at

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:27.599 
welcome over here and one good look at
that<00:02:24.299> so<00:02:25.299> there's<00:02:25.480> a<00:02:25.540> hydrogen<00:02:25.870> bottle<00:02:26.609> this

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:27.609 
that so there's a hydrogen bottle this

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:30.000 
that so there's a hydrogen bottle this
is<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.820> metal<00:02:28.030> hydrate<00:02:28.620> you<00:02:29.620> have<00:02:29.769> a<00:02:29.829> little

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
is the metal hydrate you have a little

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.400 
is the metal hydrate you have a little
bit<00:02:30.190> of<00:02:30.280> a<00:02:30.340> leak<00:02:30.519> under<00:02:30.730> that<00:02:30.970> cap<00:02:31.299> so<00:02:32.200> we're

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
bit of a leak under that cap so we're

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.949 
bit of a leak under that cap so we're
going<00:02:32.560> to<00:02:32.650> watch<00:02:32.799> for<00:02:32.829> now<00:02:33.370> is<00:02:33.820> we're<00:02:34.810> going<00:02:34.959> to

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
going to watch for now is we're going to

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.190 
going to watch for now is we're going to
turn<00:02:37.959> on<00:02:38.109> the<00:02:38.260> hydrogen<00:02:39.750> see<00:02:40.750> there's<00:02:40.930> any<00:02:41.049> in

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
turn on the hydrogen see there's any in

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.320 
turn on the hydrogen see there's any in
the<00:02:41.290> bottle

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.140 

and<00:02:47.330> it's<00:02:47.569> full-on<00:02:48.170> and<00:02:49.130> if<00:02:49.730> we<00:02:49.849> look<00:02:50.000> at<00:02:50.090> our

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
and it's full-on and if we look at our

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.330 
and it's full-on and if we look at our
meters<00:02:50.540> over<00:02:50.840> here<00:02:50.989> it's<00:02:51.110> climbed<00:02:51.470> a<00:02:51.650> bit<00:02:51.830> and

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
meters over here it's climbed a bit and

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.440 
meters over here it's climbed a bit and
that's<00:02:52.489> the<00:02:52.610> back<00:02:52.790> pressure<00:02:53.120> from<00:02:53.390> the

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
that's the back pressure from the

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.320 
that's the back pressure from the
hydrogen<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:54.349> bottle<00:02:54.680> so<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.310> next<00:02:55.610> thing<00:02:55.880> is

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
hydrogen the bottle so the next thing is

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.100 
hydrogen the bottle so the next thing is
we're<00:02:56.480> going<00:02:56.599> to<00:02:56.660> going<00:02:57.590> to<00:02:57.650> vent<00:02:57.890> some<00:02:59.110> by

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
we're going to going to vent some by

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.229 
we're going to going to vent some by
opening<00:03:00.470> this<00:03:00.620> here<00:03:00.890> and<00:03:01.520> you<00:03:01.700> can<00:03:01.850> see<00:03:02.030> it<00:03:02.150> out

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
opening this here and you can see it out

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:07.750 
opening this here and you can see it out
there<00:03:02.390> bubbling<00:03:02.840> in<00:03:03.020> here<00:03:06.250> that<00:03:07.250> basically

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
there bubbling in here that basically

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.080 
there bubbling in here that basically
clears<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.569> hydrogen<00:03:09.020> of<00:03:09.050> the<00:03:09.200> lines<00:03:09.819> and<00:03:10.819> now

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
clears the hydrogen of the lines and now

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.970 
clears the hydrogen of the lines and now
the<00:03:11.150> next<00:03:11.660> stage<00:03:11.870> is<00:03:12.080> to<00:03:12.230> put<00:03:12.410> start<00:03:12.709> putting

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
the next stage is to put start putting

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.580 
the next stage is to put start putting
hydrogen<00:03:13.340> back<00:03:13.519> in<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:13.790> bottle<00:03:14.209> or<00:03:15.140> back<00:03:15.319> into

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
hydrogen back in the bottle or back into

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.160 
hydrogen back in the bottle or back into
the<00:03:15.680> bottle<00:03:16.069> and<00:03:16.640> all<00:03:16.760> you<00:03:16.880> do<00:03:17.030> now<00:03:17.269> is<00:03:17.630> you

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
the bottle and all you do now is you

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.100 
the bottle and all you do now is you
turn<00:03:18.500> on<00:03:18.709> the<00:03:19.220> main<00:03:19.370> tank<00:03:20.380> like<00:03:21.380> so<00:03:21.709> and<00:03:22.310> now

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
turn on the main tank like so and now

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.300 
turn on the main tank like so and now
that<00:03:24.110> starts<00:03:24.500> putting<00:03:25.190> on<00:03:25.370> about<00:03:25.519> 125<00:03:26.299> psi<00:03:26.870> of

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
that starts putting on about 125 psi of

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:35.170 
that starts putting on about 125 psi of
hydrogen<00:03:28.310> on<00:03:29.120> to<00:03:29.330> the<00:03:29.420> ball<00:03:30.610> down<00:03:31.610> here<00:03:34.180> so

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
hydrogen on to the ball down here so

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.059 
hydrogen on to the ball down here so
it's<00:03:35.330> locked<00:03:35.540> off<00:03:35.780> it's<00:03:36.140> sealed<00:03:36.500> it's<00:03:36.680> cleared

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
it's locked off it's sealed it's cleared

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.270 
it's locked off it's sealed it's cleared
and<00:03:37.489> now<00:03:37.519> you<00:03:38.120> leave<00:03:38.390> it<00:03:38.540> for<00:03:38.569> about<00:03:39.530> six<00:03:40.069> to

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
and now you leave it for about six to

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.880 
and now you leave it for about six to
eight<00:03:40.400> hours<00:03:40.850> and<00:03:41.660> the<00:03:41.780> hydrogen<00:03:42.049> backfill

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
eight hours and the hydrogen backfill

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.600 
eight hours and the hydrogen backfill
into<00:03:43.160> the<00:03:43.250> bottle<00:03:43.610> and<00:03:44.950> as<00:03:45.950> you<00:03:46.160> see<00:03:46.400> there's

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
into the bottle and as you see there's

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.270 
into the bottle and as you see there's
no<00:03:47.140> the<00:03:48.140> reason<00:03:48.290> the<00:03:48.440> other<00:03:48.590> reason<00:03:48.769> I<00:03:48.829> do<00:03:49.070> this

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
no the reason the other reason I do this

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.729 
no the reason the other reason I do this
is<00:03:49.340> when<00:03:49.670> I'm<00:03:49.790> testing<00:03:50.510> them<00:03:52.510> like<00:03:53.510> this<00:03:53.780> it

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
is when I'm testing them like this it

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.860 
is when I'm testing them like this it
does<00:03:54.950> two<00:03:55.160> things<00:03:55.190> one<00:03:55.670> is<00:03:55.940> to<00:03:56.269> take<00:03:56.450> heat<00:03:56.750> away

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
does two things one is to take heat away

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.229 
does two things one is to take heat away
from<00:03:56.989> the<00:03:57.290> bottle<00:03:57.650> and<00:03:57.769> it's<00:03:57.920> filling<00:03:58.280> and<00:03:58.489> the

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
from the bottle and it's filling and the

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.360 
from the bottle and it's filling and the
second<00:03:59.690> one<00:03:59.840> is<00:04:00.049> if<00:04:00.500> there's<00:04:00.709> any<00:04:00.769> leaks<00:04:01.160> at

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
second one is if there's any leaks at

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.009 
second one is if there's any leaks at
all<00:04:01.579> coming<00:04:02.209> out<00:04:02.329> of<00:04:02.420> this<00:04:02.480> area<00:04:02.750> in<00:04:02.930> the

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
all coming out of this area in the

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.050 
all coming out of this area in the
valves<00:04:03.440> then<00:04:03.920> you<00:04:04.100> get<00:04:04.220> bubbling<00:04:04.609> you<00:04:04.730> can<00:04:04.880> see

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
valves then you get bubbling you can see

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.240 
valves then you get bubbling you can see
it<00:04:05.150> right<00:04:05.329> away<00:04:05.359> so<00:04:06.320> now<00:04:06.500> we<00:04:06.859> just<00:04:07.040> leave<00:04:07.190> it

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
it right away so now we just leave it

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.520 
it right away so now we just leave it
for<00:04:07.489> a<00:04:07.579> while<00:04:07.730> and<00:04:08.000> we'll<00:04:08.150> fill<00:04:08.359> up<00:04:08.390> that's<00:04:09.380> all

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
for a while and we'll fill up that's all

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:10.150 
for a while and we'll fill up that's all
there<00:04:09.680> is<00:04:09.709> to<00:04:09.920> it

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
there is to it

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.300 
there is to it
that's<00:04:10.670> how<00:04:10.910> you<00:04:10.970> fell<00:04:11.329> a<00:04:12.010> metal<00:04:13.010> hydrate

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
that's how you fell a metal hydrate

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.960 
that's how you fell a metal hydrate
bottle<00:04:13.750> which<00:04:14.750> will<00:04:14.930> take<00:04:15.109> about<00:04:15.530> 120<00:04:16.310> psi<00:04:16.789> or

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
bottle which will take about 120 psi or

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:25.000 
bottle which will take about 120 psi or
uh<00:04:17.030> 925<00:04:17.630> psi<00:04:18.200> and<00:04:18.500> up<00:04:19.100> to<00:04:19.310> 700<00:04:20.000> liters<00:04:20.859> of<00:04:24.010> so

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
uh 925 psi and up to 700 liters of so

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.700 
uh 925 psi and up to 700 liters of so
you<00:04:25.100> can<00:04:25.220> get<00:04:25.340> to<00:04:25.460> that<00:04:26.320> now<00:04:27.320> there<00:04:27.530> you<00:04:27.620> go

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
you can get to that now there you go

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.990 
you can get to that now there you go
seven<00:04:28.250> I<00:04:28.280> believe<00:04:28.550> is<00:04:28.669> a<00:04:28.700> metal<00:04:29.030> high<00:04:29.120> grade<00:04:31.000> in

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
seven I believe is a metal high grade in

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.080 
seven I believe is a metal high grade in
the<00:04:32.240> bottle<00:04:32.770> so<00:04:33.770> it<00:04:33.830> will<00:04:33.950> transfer<00:04:34.430> hydrogen

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
the bottle so it will transfer hydrogen

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.990 
the bottle so it will transfer hydrogen
from<00:04:35.210> the<00:04:35.300> main<00:04:35.570> tank<00:04:35.870> in<00:04:36.460> the<00:04:37.460> little<00:04:37.789> tank

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
from the main tank in the little tank

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.500 
from the main tank in the little tank
and<00:04:38.410> we<00:04:39.410> typically<00:04:39.860> use<00:04:41.650> four<00:04:42.760> bottles<00:04:43.760> using

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
and we typically use four bottles using

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:49.090 
and we typically use four bottles using
zero<00:04:44.930> already<00:04:45.200> filled<00:04:45.560> on<00:04:46.310> a<00:04:47.710> splitter<00:04:48.710> unit

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
zero already filled on a splitter unit

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.820 
zero already filled on a splitter unit
there<00:04:49.340> which<00:04:50.090> will<00:04:50.240> feed<00:04:50.450> the<00:04:50.660> fuel<00:04:51.260> cell

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:00.409 

now<00:04:55.879> assuming<00:04:56.879> that<00:04:57.119> the<00:04:58.909> hydrogen<00:04:59.909> bottle<00:05:00.360> is

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
now assuming that the hydrogen bottle is

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.879 
now assuming that the hydrogen bottle is
now<00:05:00.539> full<00:05:01.039> will<00:05:02.039> now<00:05:02.219> close<00:05:02.550> this<00:05:02.879> valve<00:05:03.889> on

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
now full will now close this valve on

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:17.209 
now full will now close this valve on
here<00:05:10.669> do<00:05:11.669> it<00:05:11.699> all<00:05:11.999> the<00:05:12.119> way<00:05:12.240> in<00:05:14.719> and<00:05:15.919> close<00:05:16.919> this

00:05:17.209 --> 00:05:17.219 
here do it all the way in and close this

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:25.999 
here do it all the way in and close this
one<00:05:21.289> then<00:05:22.289> will<00:05:23.249> we<00:05:24.149> will<00:05:24.360> dent<00:05:24.719> the<00:05:25.499> hydrogen

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:26.009 
one then will we will dent the hydrogen

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:29.929 
one then will we will dent the hydrogen
outside<00:05:26.399> through<00:05:26.729> the<00:05:26.759> bubbler<00:05:28.669> and<00:05:29.669> you<00:05:29.789> can

00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:29.939 
outside through the bubbler and you can

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:33.350 
outside through the bubbler and you can
watch<00:05:30.120> the<00:05:30.330> needle<00:05:30.509> drop<00:05:31.219> there<00:05:32.219> goes<00:05:32.580> both

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
watch the needle drop there goes both

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.279 
watch the needle drop there goes both
going<00:05:33.689> down<00:05:35.149> so<00:05:36.149> that's<00:05:36.509> all<00:05:36.749> there<00:05:36.839> is<00:05:36.899> to<00:05:37.169> it

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:37.289 
going down so that's all there is to it

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:40.730 
going down so that's all there is to it
and<00:05:38.009> now<00:05:38.279> you<00:05:38.729> take<00:05:39.149> the<00:05:39.330> bottle<00:05:39.779> out<00:05:39.899> and<00:05:40.169> you

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
and now you take the bottle out and you

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.989 
and now you take the bottle out and you
disconnect<00:05:41.430> it<00:05:41.610> from<00:05:42.080> some<00:05:43.080> set<00:05:43.379> up<00:05:43.789> which<00:05:44.789> is

00:05:44.989 --> 00:05:44.999 
disconnect it from some set up which is

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:53.439 
disconnect it from some set up which is
I<00:05:45.180> pull<00:05:45.899> it<00:05:46.020> out<00:05:48.169> take<00:05:49.169> your<00:05:49.349> wrench<00:05:51.680> hold<00:05:52.680> it

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:53.449 
I pull it out take your wrench hold it

00:05:53.449 --> 00:06:00.460 
I pull it out take your wrench hold it
and<00:05:54.449> then<00:05:54.569> simply<00:05:55.020> disconnect<00:05:55.649> it

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.470 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:10.280 

like<00:06:00.860> so

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:10.290 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:12.870 

and<00:06:11.290> you<00:06:11.440> got<00:06:11.650> your<00:06:11.830> bottles<00:06:12.190> down<00:06:12.310> full<00:06:12.639> and

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 
and you got your bottles down full and

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.670 
and you got your bottles down full and
ready<00:06:13.000> for<00:06:13.090> field<00:06:13.780> use<00:06:15.930> and<00:06:16.930> that's<00:06:17.440> always

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 
ready for field use and that's always

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:23.250 
ready for field use and that's always
the<00:06:17.979> whole<00:06:18.880> system<00:06:19.389> Oh<00:06:21.270> at<00:06:22.270> the<00:06:22.479> same<00:06:22.690> time<00:06:22.990> I

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:23.260 
the whole system Oh at the same time I

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.110 
the whole system Oh at the same time I
do<00:06:23.440> this<00:06:23.740> in<00:06:23.889> an<00:06:24.010> open<00:06:24.130> room<00:06:24.550> which<00:06:25.389> has<00:06:25.690> a

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
do this in an open room which has a

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.330 
do this in an open room which has a
ventilation<00:06:28.120> system<00:06:28.650> so<00:06:29.650> that<00:06:29.830> the<00:06:29.979> hydrogen

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:30.340 
ventilation system so that the hydrogen

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.890 
ventilation system so that the hydrogen
any<00:06:30.520> hydrogen<00:06:30.850> goes<00:06:31.120> out<00:06:31.270> through<00:06:31.479> that<00:06:31.630> vent

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:31.900 
any hydrogen goes out through that vent
