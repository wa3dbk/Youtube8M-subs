begins to grow it becomes hard to know
where<00:00:25.070> to<00:00:25.100> start<00:00:25.520> you<00:00:26.300> start<00:00:26.600> from<00:00:26.690> the<00:00:26.840> top

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
where to start you start from the top

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.740 
where to start you start from the top
from<00:00:27.380> the<00:00:27.830> bottom<00:00:28.070> or<00:00:28.400> do<00:00:28.910> you<00:00:29.000> do<00:00:29.180> a<00:00:29.210> randomly

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
from the bottom or do you do a randomly

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.660 
from the bottom or do you do a randomly
none<00:00:30.500> of<00:00:30.529> these<00:00:30.710> make<00:00:30.920> a<00:00:30.949> whole<00:00:31.250> lot<00:00:31.279> of<00:00:31.430> sense

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:31.670 
none of these make a whole lot of sense

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.099 
none of these make a whole lot of sense

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:33.109 
because the order in which you save

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:34.750 
because the order in which you save
things<00:00:33.440> isn't<00:00:33.649> necessarily<00:00:34.219> the<00:00:34.339> order<00:00:34.699> in
