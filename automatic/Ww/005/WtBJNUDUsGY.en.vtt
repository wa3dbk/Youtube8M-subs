show capacity capacity da-ad shock

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:01.809 
show capacity capacity da-ad shock
resistance<00:03:59.870> he<00:04:00.769> put<00:04:00.980> shock<00:04:01.160> resistance<00:04:01.609> in

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
resistance he put shock resistance in

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.479 
resistance he put shock resistance in
there<00:04:02.000> and<00:04:02.209> then<00:04:03.019> you<00:04:03.200> can<00:04:03.349> put<00:04:03.590> fire

there and then you can put fire

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.390 
there and then you can put fire
resistance<00:04:05.060> explosive<00:04:05.660> resistance<00:04:06.169> in<00:04:06.530> any

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
resistance explosive resistance in any

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.369 
resistance explosive resistance in any
of<00:04:07.579> these<00:04:07.730> and<00:04:08.150> let's<00:04:08.750> say<00:04:08.900> make<00:04:09.109> that

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:11.379 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:13.869 

so<00:04:12.379> this<00:04:12.680> is<00:04:12.830> basically<00:04:13.159> how<00:04:13.549> you<00:04:13.700> make<00:04:13.849> it

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:13.879 
so this is basically how you make it

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:15.940 
so this is basically how you make it
black<00:04:14.150> weapons<00:04:14.569> you<00:04:14.870> just<00:04:15.319> choose<00:04:15.650> what<00:04:15.830> if

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
you want sale it's got the warning

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.620 
you want sale it's got the warning
symbols<00:04:18.400> you<00:04:19.400> can<00:04:19.549> put<00:04:19.729> the<00:04:19.820> shotgun<00:04:20.030> barrel
