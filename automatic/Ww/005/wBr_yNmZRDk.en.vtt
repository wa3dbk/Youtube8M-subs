00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.760 
issues around safety and public safety
in<00:01:59.830> the<00:02:00.009> suburbs<00:02:00.340> as<00:02:01.000> these<00:02:01.770> challenges

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
in the suburbs as these challenges

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:03.899 
in the suburbs as these challenges
become<00:02:03.070> spread<00:02:03.369> through<00:02:03.520> a<00:02:03.549> whole<00:02:03.670> bunch<00:02:03.850> of

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
become spread through a whole bunch of

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.160 
become spread through a whole bunch of
pollen<00:02:04.119> areas<00:02:04.360> I<00:02:04.509> think<00:02:04.840> we're<00:02:04.930> going<00:02:05.020> to<00:02:05.110> lose

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
pollen areas I think we're going to lose

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.910 
pollen areas I think we're going to lose
that<00:02:05.340> again<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.520> past<00:02:07.739> experience<00:02:08.739> of

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
that again the past experience of

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.250 
that again the past experience of
suburbs<00:02:09.610> versus<00:02:09.940> downtown<00:02:10.450> side<00:02:10.780> we're

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
suburbs versus downtown side we're

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.930 
suburbs versus downtown side we're
getting<00:02:11.350> the<00:02:11.530> point<00:02:11.739> now<00:02:11.890> where<00:02:11.940> whole

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
getting the point now where whole

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.820 
getting the point now where whole
metropolitan<00:02:13.540> areas<00:02:13.780> are<00:02:13.930> realizing<00:02:14.380> gosh<00:02:14.590> we

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
metropolitan areas are realizing gosh we

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.830 
metropolitan areas are realizing gosh we
all<00:02:14.980> link<00:02:15.340> arms<00:02:15.640> and<00:02:16.030> work<00:02:16.239> together<00:02:16.390> on<00:02:16.630> these

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
all link arms and work together on these

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.300 
all link arms and work together on these
things<00:02:17.080> we<00:02:17.170> can<00:02:17.290> actually<00:02:17.470> figure<00:02:18.040> some<00:02:18.280> of

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
things we can actually figure some of

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.850 
things we can actually figure some of
this<00:02:18.430> stuff<00:02:18.640> out<00:02:18.910> and<00:02:19.470> ultimately<00:02:20.470> that's<00:02:20.620> I

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
this stuff out and ultimately that's I

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.020 
this stuff out and ultimately that's I
think<00:02:21.100> that's<00:02:21.250> what<00:02:21.430> any<00:02:21.580> presidential

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
think that's what any presidential

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.060 
think that's what any presidential
agenda<00:02:22.570> has<00:02:22.690> to<00:02:22.840> get<00:02:23.050> to<00:02:23.080> is<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.739> point<00:02:23.950> where

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
agenda has to get to is the point where

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.710 
agenda has to get to is the point where
we<00:02:24.130> start<00:02:24.370> solving<00:02:24.730> problems<00:02:25.360> instead<00:02:25.660> of

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
we start solving problems instead of

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:33.360 
we start solving problems instead of
just<00:02:25.870> throwing<00:02:26.050> money<00:02:26.200> at<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:32.230> real<00:02:32.500> key

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
just throwing money at the real key

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.970 
just throwing money at the real key
issues<00:02:33.670> for<00:02:33.700> us<00:02:34.030> are<00:02:34.510> you<00:02:35.290> know<00:02:35.410> those<00:02:35.620> quality

I think our national debate should be
how<00:03:42.100> do<00:03:42.160> we<00:03:42.250> break<00:03:42.400> those<00:03:42.549> walls<00:03:42.609> down<00:03:42.970> and<00:03:43.090> get
