00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.180 
so I'm gonna try to make sure I just
stand<00:06:52.480> on<00:06:52.780> course<00:06:53.320> but<00:06:53.410> if<00:06:53.710> there's<00:06:53.890> something

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:54.190 
stand on course but if there's something

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:55.650 
stand on course but if there's something
I<00:06:54.340> feel<00:06:54.460> like<00:06:54.520> I'm<00:06:54.760> wavering<00:06:55.120> you<00:06:55.270> might<00:06:55.420> catch

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:55.660 
I feel like I'm wavering you might catch

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.320 
I feel like I'm wavering you might catch
me<00:06:55.840> back<00:06:56.050> just<00:06:56.320> to<00:06:57.100> kind<00:06:57.400> of<00:06:57.520> get<00:06:58.090> some

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:58.330 
me back just to kind of get some

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.690 
me back just to kind of get some
feedback<00:06:59.290> or<00:06:59.560> just<00:06:59.620> snap<00:07:00.040> me<00:07:00.250> out<00:07:00.280> of<00:07:00.490> whatever

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:00.700 
feedback or just snap me out of whatever

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.660 
feedback or just snap me out of whatever
my<00:07:01.000> trans<00:07:01.360> is<00:07:01.600> in<00:07:01.750> so<00:07:02.320> you<00:07:02.740> most<00:07:03.010> likely<00:07:03.460> won't

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:03.670 
my trans is in so you most likely won't

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:05.670 
my trans is in so you most likely won't
hear<00:07:03.940> from<00:07:04.090> me<00:07:04.240> till<00:07:04.480> Tuesday<00:07:04.990> but<00:07:05.410> it's

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.170 
hear from me till Tuesday but it's
possible<00:07:06.160> you'll<00:07:06.310> hear<00:07:06.460> from<00:07:06.490> me<00:07:06.730> before<00:07:06.850> then

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:07.180
