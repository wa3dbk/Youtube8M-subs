00:00:21.452 --> 00:00:22.000
 Blacks go back to Africa!! 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 Call the ambulance!! 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:28.000
 Oh my god!! 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.600
 I am on fire!! 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 I am starting to melt!! 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.500
 I am full of regrets all over the body!! 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.000
 Super sad. 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 The crash is okay, but this flame, ah ah ah ah 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:44.000
 Oh, my God 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 Right, let me start the ejection chair!! 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.899
 Ah, my egg!! 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.700
 My skin is getting dark 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.000
 Oh, this is really ironic about my racial discrimination. 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 The incident itself is ironic because my eyes are burning into the bones. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 Ah, I have a racist tendency that must be related to the name my parents took. 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 I hurt the heart of others, just like the pain of my sternum now. 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:12.899
 Isn't this ironic? 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 Ah, I don't know, maybe it's my irony definition. 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 Ah! Chim Chim! Chim Chim! My little baby!! 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 Have you been hiding in the rear compartment?? 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:24.800
 Run!! 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.000
 I still have time!! 

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:26.998
 Do not!! 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 No!! Chim Chim! Please go!! The fire is still burning. 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 Chim Chim! Please! Let me go!! Don't be a hero, Chim Chim! 

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:37.000
 Chim Chim! No!! Chim Chim! No!!! 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 Why?! Why is there such a thing!? My little monkey friend!!! 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 Oh my God!! Why is this happening to Chim Chim!??? 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.000
 How happy he was shaking in the trees before, but now it is burning in the flame!! 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 Why... why!! 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:56.299
 Chim Chim... 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 Ok, living in hatred is inevitable that this will happen. 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.000
 I just could have said, "I wish you a happy day!", but... no~~ 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 My dear little monkey friend!! 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.300
 It turned black!! 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 I am coming, Chim Chim! 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 Dad, this is going home!! 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 Hey! The door is still playing!! 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:21.900
 It turned out that this abominable child safety lock was troublesome for me every time... 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
