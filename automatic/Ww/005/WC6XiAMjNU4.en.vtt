00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
game this is a lot different from the

mod<00:01:08.790> no<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.630> still<00:01:09.930> feels<00:01:10.140> like<00:01:10.290> sin<00:01:10.560> theta

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
mod no it still feels like sin theta

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.560 
mod no it still feels like sin theta

there's

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.350 
there's
there's<00:01:17.650> a<00:01:17.710> lack<00:01:17.890> of<00:01:17.920> content<00:01:18.460> I<00:01:18.610> feel<00:01:18.850> all

there's a lack of content I feel all

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.870 
there's a lack of content I feel all
right<00:01:19.420> here<00:01:19.660> to<00:01:19.750> the<00:01:19.840> book<00:01:20.610> while<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:21.730> map

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
right here to the book while the map

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.360 
right here to the book while the map
switching<00:01:22.300> there<00:01:23.940> so<00:01:24.940> there's<00:01:25.480> a<00:01:25.540> lack<00:01:25.780> of

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 
switching there so there's a lack of

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.370 
switching there so there's a lack of
there's<00:01:27.370> a<00:01:27.460> lack<00:01:27.610> of<00:01:28.110> dinosaurs<00:01:29.110> there's<00:01:29.290> only

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
there's a lack of dinosaurs there's only

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.470 
there's a lack of dinosaurs there's only
three<00:01:29.740> classes<00:01:30.250> you<00:01:30.610> can<00:01:30.700> play<00:01:30.910> doctor

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:31.480 
three classes you can play doctor

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.960 
three classes you can play doctor
classes<00:01:31.810> you<00:01:31.870> can<00:01:31.960> play<00:01:32.200> so<00:01:32.830> far<00:01:33.100> though<00:01:33.940> I

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
classes you can play so far though I

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.460 
classes you can play so far though I
suppose<00:01:34.270> they<00:01:34.450> can't<00:01:34.630> really<00:01:34.810> add<00:01:34.930> a<00:01:34.960> big<00:01:35.260> one

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
suppose they can't really add a big one

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.830 
suppose they can't really add a big one
because<00:01:35.740> that<00:01:35.890> would<00:01:36.250> kind<00:01:36.940> of<00:01:37.060> disrupt<00:01:37.570> the

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
because that would kind of disrupt the

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.230 
because that would kind of disrupt the
game<00:01:38.170> play<00:01:38.890> and<00:01:39.130> how<00:01:39.670> would<00:01:39.730> the<00:01:39.910> hell<00:01:40.060> that

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
game play and how would the hell that

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.750 
game play and how would the hell that
was<00:01:40.270> designed<00:01:40.450> the<00:01:40.810> map<00:01:40.990> for<00:01:41.200> that<00:01:41.610> but<00:01:42.610> I<00:01:42.640> do

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
was designed the map for that but I do

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.880 
was designed the map for that but I do
know<00:01:42.970> that<00:01:43.000> the<00:01:43.240> developer<00:01:43.720> is<00:01:43.930> very<00:01:44.620> very

this game so we've done here has a very
nice<00:02:19.890> reload<00:02:20.890> system<00:02:22.050> I'm<00:02:23.050> playing<00:02:23.260> as<00:02:23.410> a

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
nice reload system I'm playing as a

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.080 
nice reload system I'm playing as a
German<00:02:23.800> infantry<00:02:23.980> man<00:02:24.280> that<00:02:24.760> that<00:02:24.940> isn't

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
German infantry man that that isn't

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.990 
German infantry man that that isn't
already<00:02:25.330> obvious<00:02:25.870> and<00:02:26.550> that's<00:02:27.550> one<00:02:27.790> problem

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
already obvious and that's one problem

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.120 
already obvious and that's one problem
that<00:02:28.209> needs<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:28.630> be<00:02:28.720> fixed<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:29.709> problem<00:02:30.040> is

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
that needs to be fixed the problem is

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.970 
that needs to be fixed the problem is
that<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.489> Germans<00:02:30.880> get<00:02:31.650> their<00:02:32.650> drummers<00:02:32.920> gets

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
that the Germans get their drummers gets

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.790 
that the Germans get their drummers gets
dinosaurs<00:02:33.640> in<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.910> American<00:02:34.390> stone<00:02:34.570> so<00:02:35.530> I

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
dinosaurs in the American stone so I

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.949 
dinosaurs in the American stone so I
think<00:02:36.610> that<00:02:36.910> they<00:02:37.120> should<00:02:37.150> balance<00:02:37.480> this<00:02:37.780> by

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
think that they should balance this by

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.560 
think that they should balance this by
maybe<00:02:38.320> adding<00:02:38.650> some<00:02:38.880> may<00:02:39.880> be<00:02:39.940> asking<00:02:40.239> them<00:02:40.420> is

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
maybe adding some may be asking them is

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.160 
maybe adding some may be asking them is
cemetery<00:02:41.260> Tigers<00:02:41.620> to<00:02:41.830> the<00:02:41.890> Allies<00:02:42.280> side<00:02:43.170> I'll

cemetery Tigers to the Allies side I'll
certainly<00:02:44.560> live<00:02:44.830> things<00:02:45.520> up<00:02:45.900> but<00:02:46.900> you<00:02:47.080> know

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
certainly live things up but you know

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.020 
certainly live things up but you know
the<00:02:47.500> games<00:02:47.680> about<00:02:47.800> dinosaurs<00:02:48.400> and<00:02:48.580> nothing

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030

you can toss to give at enemy soldiers

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.090 
you can toss to give at enemy soldiers
and<00:02:54.640> kill<00:02:54.760> them<00:02:55.170> I've<00:02:56.170> seen<00:02:56.350> people<00:02:56.470> get<00:02:56.800> three

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100

so<00:03:00.970> this<00:03:01.150> is<00:03:01.239> on<00:03:01.360> the<00:03:01.390> map<00:03:01.599> fortress<00:03:02.140> I<00:03:02.470> think<00:03:02.709> I

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
so this is on the map fortress I think I

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.440 
so this is on the map fortress I think I
haven't<00:03:03.099> memorized<00:03:03.519> all<00:03:03.640> the<00:03:03.670> match<00:03:03.879> game<00:03:04.120> I

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
haven't memorized all the match game I

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.360 
haven't memorized all the match game I
need<00:03:05.049> to<00:03:05.140> play<00:03:05.230> a<00:03:05.290> little<00:03:05.440> more<00:03:05.709> before<00:03:05.950> I<00:03:06.099> can

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
need to play a little more before I can

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.640 
need to play a little more before I can
I've<00:03:07.090> only<00:03:07.269> played<00:03:07.450> on<00:03:07.659> to<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:08.019> match<00:03:08.200> so<00:03:08.590> far

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
I've only played on to the match so far

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.979 
I've only played on to the match so far
because<00:03:09.310> I<00:03:09.370> haven't<00:03:09.519> seen<00:03:09.790> my<00:03:10.510> Nana<00:03:10.720> to<00:03:10.870> match

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
because I haven't seen my Nana to match

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.110 
because I haven't seen my Nana to match
with<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.230> objective<00:03:11.349> man<00:03:11.799> so<00:03:12.610> this<00:03:12.819> is<00:03:12.849> one

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
with the objective man so this is one

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.380 
with the objective man so this is one
with<00:03:13.620> we<00:03:14.620> had<00:03:14.739> to<00:03:14.830> escort<00:03:15.010> a<00:03:15.310> triceratops<00:03:16.000> with

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
with we had to escort a triceratops with

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.449 
with we had to escort a triceratops with
a<00:03:16.420> tank<00:03:17.140> gun<00:03:17.319> on<00:03:17.500> it<00:03:17.650> through<00:03:18.069> each<00:03:18.250> objective

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
a tank gun on it through each objective

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.759 
a tank gun on it through each objective
kind<00:03:19.120> of<00:03:19.180> like<00:03:19.269> rush<00:03:19.510> and<00:03:20.290> valve<00:03:20.590> will

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
kind of like rush and valve will

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.610 
kind of like rush and valve will
actually<00:03:21.069> you<00:03:21.159> gotta<00:03:21.310> get<00:03:21.879> to<00:03:22.000> each<00:03:22.120> objective

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
actually you gotta get to each objective

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.119 
actually you gotta get to each objective
and<00:03:24.120> i<00:03:25.120> only<00:03:25.989> played<00:03:26.200> at<00:03:26.290> one<00:03:26.409> time<00:03:26.590> and<00:03:26.920> that

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:27.129 
and i only played at one time and that

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:29.339 
and i only played at one time and that
was<00:03:27.280> hardly<00:03:27.870> highly<00:03:28.870> enough<00:03:29.019> to<00:03:29.230> get

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349 
was hardly highly enough to get

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.000 
was hardly highly enough to get
experience<00:03:29.650> out<00:03:29.950> of<00:03:29.980> this<00:03:30.129> it<00:03:30.700> was<00:03:30.849> 300<00:03:31.420> ping

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
experience out of this it was 300 ping

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.309 
experience out of this it was 300 ping
so<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.129> game<00:03:33.250> has<00:03:33.430> basic<00:03:33.849> teamwork<00:03:34.319> teamwork

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
so the game has basic teamwork teamwork

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.380 
so the game has basic teamwork teamwork
options<00:03:35.890> for<00:03:36.099> both<00:03:36.250> sides<00:03:36.459> like<00:03:36.730> giving<00:03:37.299> out

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
options for both sides like giving out

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.839 
options for both sides like giving out
ammo<00:03:37.720> and<00:03:37.959> medic<00:03:38.250> so<00:03:39.250> if<00:03:39.519> you're<00:03:39.609> trying<00:03:39.760> to

people are just waiting to see how the
game<00:03:55.900> looks<00:03:55.930> because<00:03:56.590> the<00:03:56.859> twenty<00:03:57.190> dollar

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
game looks because the twenty dollar

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.059 
game looks because the twenty dollar
price<00:03:57.640> tag<00:03:57.879> is<00:03:57.909> exactly<00:03:58.739> encourage<00:03:59.739> them<00:03:59.950> you

price tag is exactly encourage them you

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.599 
price tag is exactly encourage them you
could<00:04:00.190> say<00:04:00.370> but<00:04:00.810> I<00:04:02.159> recommend<00:04:03.159> this<00:04:03.220> game<00:04:03.280> for

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
could say but I recommend this game for

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:06.180 
could say but I recommend this game for
fun<00:04:03.760> and<00:04:04.139> it's<00:04:05.139> a<00:04:05.290> free<00:04:05.470> taunting<00:04:05.859> comes<00:04:05.980> along

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
fun and it's a free taunting comes along

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.650 
fun and it's a free taunting comes along
then<00:04:06.340> the<00:04:06.459> game<00:04:06.549> will<00:04:06.730> have<00:04:06.849> a<00:04:06.880> long<00:04:07.120> life<00:04:07.329> and

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
then the game will have a long life and

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.690 
then the game will have a long life and
it<00:04:08.290> won't<00:04:08.650> become<00:04:08.919> just<00:04:09.130> like<00:04:09.220> I<00:04:09.340> get<00:04:09.609> my

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
it won't become just like I get my

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.720 
it won't become just like I get my
anything<00:04:10.799> taking<00:04:11.799> the<00:04:12.099> dinosaurs<00:04:12.579> are<00:04:12.700> a

anything taking the dinosaurs are a

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.150 
anything taking the dinosaurs are a
major<00:04:12.940> part<00:04:13.060> is<00:04:13.359> game<00:04:13.569> and<00:04:13.950> will<00:04:14.950> probably

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
major part is game and will probably

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.620 
major part is game and will probably
stay<00:04:15.459> that<00:04:15.579> way<00:04:15.760> I<00:04:16.000> got<00:04:16.750> that<00:04:16.900> guy<00:04:17.079> in<00:04:17.109> one<00:04:17.410> shot

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
stay that way I got that guy in one shot

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.320 
stay that way I got that guy in one shot

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.210 
reload beached
so<00:04:22.900> I'm<00:04:22.990> moving<00:04:23.110> along<00:04:23.319> in<00:04:23.470> the<00:04:23.530> back<00:04:23.740> here<00:04:24.009> the

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
so I'm moving along in the back here the

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.029 
so I'm moving along in the back here the
map<00:04:24.400> fortress<00:04:25.150> and<00:04:25.389> the<00:04:26.110> relo<00:04:26.379> a<00:04:26.409> mission<00:04:26.860> for

map fortress and the relo a mission for

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:29.790 
map fortress and the relo a mission for
this<00:04:27.189> mp40<00:04:27.879> sucks<00:04:28.180> and<00:04:29.139> you<00:04:29.259> really<00:04:29.500> need<00:04:29.620> to

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
this mp40 sucks and you really need to

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.170 
this mp40 sucks and you really need to
address<00:04:30.250> that<00:04:30.490> a<00:04:30.520> little<00:04:32.370> ha<00:04:33.370> of<00:04:33.819> course<00:04:33.939> get

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
address that a little ha of course get

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.990 
address that a little ha of course get
that<00:04:34.360> guy<00:04:34.509> over<00:04:34.659> there<00:04:35.280> so<00:04:36.280> I<00:04:38.849> guess<00:04:39.849> that's

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
that guy over there so I guess that's

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.730 
that guy over there so I guess that's
basically<00:04:40.419> all<00:04:40.539> we<00:04:40.750> talk<00:04:40.930> about<00:04:40.960> this<00:04:41.289> game<00:04:41.530> so

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
basically all we talk about this game so

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.040 
basically all we talk about this game so
far<00:04:41.949> it's<00:04:42.639> on<00:04:42.759> the<00:04:42.909> source<00:04:43.120> engine<00:04:43.330> and<00:04:43.719> it

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
far it's on the source engine and it

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.809 
far it's on the source engine and it
runs<00:04:44.199> pretty<00:04:44.439> smoothly<00:04:44.800> there's<00:04:45.189> a<00:04:45.280> little

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:45.819 
runs pretty smoothly there's a little

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:47.249 
runs pretty smoothly there's a little
stuttering<00:04:46.270> there<00:04:46.389> and<00:04:46.539> there<00:04:46.689> but<00:04:46.990> that's

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:47.259 
stuttering there and there but that's

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:49.529 
stuttering there and there but that's
