00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
but this is the one I choose to use for

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.640 
but this is the one I choose to use for
my<00:02:12.760> second<00:02:13.180> angle<00:02:13.420> whether<00:02:13.870> it<00:02:13.989> be<00:02:14.080> above<00:02:14.349> or

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
my second angle whether it be above or

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.830 
my second angle whether it be above or
around<00:02:14.860> me<00:02:15.040> or<00:02:15.129> wherever<00:02:15.340> I<00:02:15.760> choose<00:02:15.790> to<00:02:16.269> place

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
it that is mounted to the tree using a

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.809 
it that is mounted to the tree using a
couple<00:02:22.060> a<00:02:22.390> couple<00:02:22.860> instruments<00:02:23.860> here<00:02:24.040> one<00:02:24.640> is

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
couple a couple instruments here one is

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.729 
couple a couple instruments here one is
just<00:02:25.030> your<00:02:25.209> regular<00:02:25.390> old<00:02:25.599> bow<00:02:25.959> holder<00:02:26.349> I<00:02:26.500> end

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
just your regular old bow holder I end

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.140 
just your regular old bow holder I end
up<00:02:26.830> putting<00:02:27.010> this<00:02:27.250> right<00:02:27.519> into<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.879> tree

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
up putting this right into the tree

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.360 
up putting this right into the tree
wherever<00:02:28.480> wherever<00:02:29.319> I<00:02:29.440> need<00:02:29.709> it<00:02:29.860> and<00:02:30.250> the

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
wherever wherever I need it and the

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.920 
wherever wherever I need it and the
second<00:02:30.790> thing<00:02:30.940> is<00:02:31.120> and<00:02:31.360> I<00:02:31.420> don't<00:02:31.569> see<00:02:31.690> a<00:02:31.720> lot<00:02:31.900> of

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
second thing is and I don't see a lot of

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.839 
second thing is and I don't see a lot of
people<00:02:32.110> using<00:02:32.620> this<00:02:32.769> but<00:02:33.040> I<00:02:33.280> found<00:02:33.640> this

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
people using this but I found this

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.989 
people using this but I found this
several<00:02:34.390> years<00:02:34.540> ago<00:02:34.750> this<00:02:34.989> is<00:02:35.080> a<00:02:35.140> very<00:02:35.440> handy

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:35.999 
several years ago this is a very handy

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:37.830 
several years ago this is a very handy
camera<00:02:36.999> mount

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
camera mount

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.000 
camera mount
it's<00:02:38.049> from<00:02:38.680> trophy<00:02:39.010> tools

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
it's from trophy tools

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.610 
it's from trophy tools
and<00:02:40.370> basically<00:02:41.000> it's<00:02:41.330> a<00:02:41.360> clamp<00:02:41.750> you<00:02:42.470> just

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
and basically it's a clamp you just

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.280 
and basically it's a clamp you just
clamp<00:02:42.890> this<00:02:43.099> on<00:02:43.310> limbs<00:02:43.640> or<00:02:43.910> whatever<00:02:44.209> but<00:02:45.170> the

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
clamp this on limbs or whatever but the

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.600 
clamp this on limbs or whatever but the
beauty<00:02:45.590> of<00:02:45.620> this<00:02:45.830> is<00:02:46.040> it's<00:02:46.250> got<00:02:46.400> this

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
beauty of this is it's got this

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.020 
beauty of this is it's got this
swiveling<00:02:47.269> and<00:02:47.560> rotating<00:02:48.560> ball<00:02:48.830> on<00:02:49.160> top<00:02:49.670> of<00:02:49.879> it

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
swiveling and rotating ball on top of it

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.640 
swiveling and rotating ball on top of it
which<00:02:50.239> allows<00:02:50.569> you<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:50.840> position<00:02:51.110> the<00:02:51.470> camera

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
which allows you to position the camera

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.559 
which allows you to position the camera
anywhere<00:02:52.250> this<00:02:52.430> is<00:02:52.489> just<00:02:52.910> a<00:02:53.000> great<00:02:53.330> all-around

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
anywhere this is just a great all-around

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.930 
anywhere this is just a great all-around
mount<00:02:54.200> so<00:02:54.890> what<00:02:55.040> I<00:02:55.069> end<00:02:55.250> up<00:02:55.310> doing<00:02:55.370> is<00:02:55.730> running

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
mount so what I end up doing is running

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.180 
mount so what I end up doing is running
this<00:02:56.239> the<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.959> bow<00:02:57.260> holder<00:02:57.620> into<00:02:57.769> the<00:02:57.890> tree

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
this the the bow holder into the tree

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.350 
this the the bow holder into the tree
wherever<00:02:58.700> that<00:02:58.940> may<00:02:59.150> be

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
wherever that may be

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.650 
wherever that may be
and<00:02:59.599> I<00:03:00.380> just<00:03:00.590> take<00:03:00.769> this<00:03:01.040> this<00:03:01.580> clamp<00:03:02.180> here<00:03:02.300> and

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
and I just take this this clamp here and

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.570 
and I just take this this clamp here and
clamp<00:03:03.200> it<00:03:03.349> right<00:03:03.380> onto<00:03:03.739> that<00:03:04.010> and<00:03:04.250> that's<00:03:04.400> my

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
clamp it right onto that and that's my

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.970 
clamp it right onto that and that's my
second<00:03:05.000> angle<00:03:05.300> or<00:03:05.630> if<00:03:05.930> I<00:03:06.049> have<00:03:06.260> a<00:03:06.290> limb<00:03:06.560> handy

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
second angle or if I have a limb handy

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.380 
second angle or if I have a limb handy
or<00:03:07.069> whatever<00:03:07.370> I<00:03:07.489> don't<00:03:07.730> even<00:03:07.849> use<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.239> bowl

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
or whatever I don't even use the bowl

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.930 
or whatever I don't even use the bowl
holder<00:03:08.660> I<00:03:08.720> just<00:03:08.930> use<00:03:09.110> this<00:03:09.319> guy<00:03:09.530> and<00:03:09.940> then

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
holder I just use this guy and then

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.600 
holder I just use this guy and then
clamp<00:03:11.180> it<00:03:11.390> into<00:03:11.540> the<00:03:11.690> tree<00:03:11.930> so<00:03:12.080> it's<00:03:12.200> a<00:03:12.319> very

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
clamp it into the tree so it's a very

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.520 
clamp it into the tree so it's a very
very<00:03:13.610> slick<00:03:14.090> system<00:03:14.630> to<00:03:14.780> get<00:03:14.959> your<00:03:15.110> second

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
very slick system to get your second

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.050 
very slick system to get your second
angle<00:03:15.799> and<00:03:15.950> it's<00:03:16.130> not<00:03:16.310> doesn't<00:03:16.790> involve

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
angle and it's not doesn't involve

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.729 
angle and it's not doesn't involve
another<00:03:17.180> arm<00:03:17.660> or<00:03:17.930> anything<00:03:18.019> like<00:03:18.349> that<00:03:18.410> it's

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
another arm or anything like that it's

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.900 
another arm or anything like that it's
just<00:03:18.920> very<00:03:18.950> small<00:03:19.900> tools<00:03:20.900> if<00:03:21.230> you<00:03:21.349> will<00:03:21.910> get

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
just very small tools if you will get

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.180 
just very small tools if you will get
get<00:03:23.780> that<00:03:23.989> second<00:03:24.530> angle<00:03:26.170> lastly<00:03:27.170> is<00:03:27.410> a<00:03:27.590> camera

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
get that second angle lastly is a camera

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.470 
get that second angle lastly is a camera
that<00:03:28.519> I<00:03:28.579> use<00:03:28.880> for<00:03:29.709> it's<00:03:30.709> like<00:03:30.829> the<00:03:31.480> pointing

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
that I use for it's like the pointing

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.440 
that I use for it's like the pointing
back<00:03:32.660> at<00:03:32.690> me<00:03:32.989> oh<00:03:33.019> and<00:03:33.349> I<00:03:33.440> mount<00:03:33.799> it<00:03:33.950> to<00:03:33.980> my<00:03:34.160> bow

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
back at me oh and I mount it to my bow
