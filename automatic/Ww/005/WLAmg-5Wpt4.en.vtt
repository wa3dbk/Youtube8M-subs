00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
customizing it so let's take a look at

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.279 
customizing it so let's take a look at
some<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.760> settings<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.300> we<00:00:48.539> do<00:00:48.780> get<00:00:49.050> in

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
some of the settings that we do get in

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.680 
some of the settings that we do get in
this<00:00:49.440> ROM<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:50.129> in<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.820> settings<00:00:51.180> menu<00:00:51.270> you

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
this ROM so in the settings menu you

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.810 
this ROM so in the settings menu you
will<00:00:51.719> have<00:00:52.050> two<00:00:52.289> new<00:00:52.469> sections<00:00:52.980> rom<00:00:53.309> control

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
will have two new sections rom control

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.869 
will have two new sections rom control
and<00:00:54.059> themes<00:00:54.449> if<00:00:54.840> we<00:00:55.680> first<00:00:55.949> pop-up<00:00:56.250> into<00:00:56.550> rom

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
and themes if we first pop-up into rom

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.670 
and themes if we first pop-up into rom
control<00:00:57.360> this<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:58.050> where<00:00:58.230> most<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.590> the

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
control this is where most of the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.260 
control this is where most of the
customization<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.640> going<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.879> be<00:01:00.000> happening

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
customization is going to be happening

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.020 
customization is going to be happening
but<00:01:01.199> first<00:01:01.530> let's<00:01:01.800> just<00:01:01.890> take<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.250> look<00:01:02.340> at<00:01:02.730> the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
but first let's just take a look at the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.299 
but first let's just take a look at the
about<00:01:03.090> section<00:01:03.600> which<00:01:04.019> automatically<00:01:04.890> opens

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
about section which automatically opens

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.460 
about section which automatically opens
up<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.760> then<00:01:06.420> we<00:01:06.540> get<00:01:06.689> this<00:01:06.840> menu<00:01:07.140> section

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
up and then we get this menu section

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.890 
up and then we get this menu section
where<00:01:07.950> basically<00:01:08.700> all<00:01:08.939> your<00:01:09.090> customized<00:01:09.600> a

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
where basically all your customized a

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.320 
where basically all your customized a
bowl<00:01:10.409> options<00:01:10.890> will<00:01:11.070> be<00:01:11.220> there<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:12.090> as<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.210> can

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
bowl options will be there so as you can

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.960 
bowl options will be there so as you can
see<00:01:12.479> we<00:01:12.600> have<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.750> whole<00:01:13.080> range<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.650> different

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
see we have a whole range of different

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.640 
see we have a whole range of different
options<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.180> let's<00:01:15.689> go<00:01:16.020> through<00:01:16.259> them<00:01:16.409> one<00:01:16.470> by

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
options and let's go through them one by

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.850 
options and let's go through them one by
one<00:01:17.689> so<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:19.080> first<00:01:19.320> one<00:01:19.409> we're<00:01:19.530> going<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.680> take

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
one so the first one we're going to take

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.100 
one so the first one we're going to take
a<00:01:19.890> look<00:01:20.100> at<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.460> general<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.150> under<00:01:21.659> general

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
a look at is general and under general

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.570 
a look at is general and under general
there<00:01:22.380> isn't<00:01:22.770> really<00:01:22.860> much<00:01:23.009> you're<00:01:23.369> going<00:01:23.520> to

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
there isn't really much you're going to

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.149 
there isn't really much you're going to
find<00:01:23.850> just<00:01:24.600> an<00:01:24.689> option<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.320> wake<00:01:25.500> up<00:01:25.710> when<00:01:26.040> you

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
find just an option to wake up when you

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.609 
find just an option to wake up when you
plug<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:26.670> on<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.820> charger<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:28.320> next

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
plug it in on the charger the next

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.890 
plug it in on the charger the next
option<00:01:28.740> also<00:01:29.280> hardware<00:01:29.939> keys<00:01:30.180> also<00:01:30.479> doesn't

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
option also hardware keys also doesn't

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.530 
option also hardware keys also doesn't
really<00:01:31.049> have<00:01:31.259> too<00:01:32.220> many<00:01:32.400> settings<00:01:32.970> but<00:01:33.299> it's

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
really have too many settings but it's

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.740 
really have too many settings but it's
just<00:01:33.840> for<00:01:33.930> volume<00:01:34.680> smashed<00:01:35.130> rotation<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:36.600> can

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
just for volume smashed rotation you can

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.569 
just for volume smashed rotation you can
take<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.930> look<00:01:37.140> at<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.680> didn't<00:01:38.250> find<00:01:38.460> it

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
take a look at that I didn't find it

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.300 
take a look at that I didn't find it
really<00:01:38.759> useful<00:01:38.930> but<00:01:39.930> if<00:01:40.290> you're<00:01:40.829> having

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
really useful but if you're having

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.210 
really useful but if you're having
rotating<00:01:42.000> cloud<00:01:42.270> problems<00:01:43.049> then<00:01:43.829> maybe<00:01:44.070> it's

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
rotating cloud problems then maybe it's

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.100 
rotating cloud problems then maybe it's
for<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.880> then<00:01:45.420> we<00:01:45.509> get<00:01:45.659> into<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.960> real

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
for you and then we get into the real

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.810 
for you and then we get into the real
setting<00:01:46.530> starting<00:01:46.920> off<00:01:47.040> with<00:01:47.189> lock<00:01:47.490> screen

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
setting starting off with lock screen

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
volume rocker the Nexus transparent lock

volume rocker the Nexus transparent lock
screen<00:02:01.680> which<00:02:01.979> basically<00:02:02.460> does<00:02:03.210> what<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.600> says

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
screen which basically does what it says

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.980 
screen which basically does what it says
I<00:02:04.140> didn't<00:02:04.770> find<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.040> useful<00:02:05.310> but<00:02:06.149> again<00:02:06.509> if

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
I didn't find that useful but again if

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.919 
I didn't find that useful but again if
you<00:02:07.409> want<00:02:07.649> that<00:02:07.710> feature<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.369> is<00:02:08.550> there<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.119> if

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
you want that feature it is there and if

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.020 
you want that feature it is there and if
we<00:02:10.050> pop<00:02:10.259> back<00:02:10.410> into<00:02:10.649> rom<00:02:10.950> control<00:02:11.430> we<00:02:11.640> do<00:02:11.819> get<00:02:12.000> a

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
we pop back into rom control we do get a

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.650 
we pop back into rom control we do get a
status<00:02:12.450> bar<00:02:12.780> section

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
status bar section

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.780 
status bar section
so<00:02:14.020> this<00:02:14.320> is<00:02:14.470> basically<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.890> usual<00:02:15.010> stuff<00:02:15.490> you

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
so this is basically the usual stuff you

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.510 
so this is basically the usual stuff you
would<00:02:15.910> expect<00:02:16.300> in<00:02:16.680> even<00:02:17.680> a<00:02:17.770> cyanogenmod<00:02:18.370> rom

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
would expect in even a cyanogenmod rom

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.910 
would expect in even a cyanogenmod rom
you<00:02:19.300> could<00:02:19.450> go<00:02:19.600> through<00:02:19.870> turn<00:02:20.260> on<00:02:20.440> stuff<00:02:20.770> like

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
you could go through turn on stuff like

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.950 
you could go through turn on stuff like
battery<00:02:21.640> percentage<00:02:22.590> you<00:02:23.590> could<00:02:23.770> also<00:02:23.920> in

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
battery percentage you could also in

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.810 
battery percentage you could also in
enable<00:02:25.960> brightness<00:02:26.530> slider<00:02:27.160> so<00:02:27.580> you<00:02:27.670> could

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
enable brightness slider so you could

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.460 
enable brightness slider so you could
slide<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.270> status<00:02:28.660> bar<00:02:28.690> to<00:02:28.990> change<00:02:29.260> the

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
slide the status bar to change the

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.160 
slide the status bar to change the
brightness<00:02:29.650> and<00:02:30.270> as<00:02:31.270> you<00:02:31.390> can<00:02:31.510> see<00:02:31.540> there's

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
brightness and as you can see there's

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.590 
brightness and as you can see there's
the<00:02:32.410> battery<00:02:32.740> percentage<00:02:32.950> indicator<00:02:33.600> you

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
the battery percentage indicator you

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.450 
the battery percentage indicator you
don't<00:02:34.750> get<00:02:34.870> actually<00:02:35.470> too<00:02:35.710> many<00:02:35.890> options<00:02:36.100> you

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
don't get actually too many options you

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.130 
don't get actually too many options you
can<00:02:36.610> really<00:02:36.880> customize<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.630> battery<00:02:37.930> icon

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
can really customize the battery icon

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.270 
can really customize the battery icon
but<00:02:39.100> you<00:02:39.220> can't<00:02:39.490> hide<00:02:39.670> it<00:02:39.850> if<00:02:40.000> you<00:02:40.180> want<00:02:40.450> and

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
but you can't hide it if you want and

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.100 
but you can't hide it if you want and
that's<00:02:42.280> pretty<00:02:42.460> much<00:02:42.580> it<00:02:42.730> in<00:02:43.030> status<00:02:43.540> bar<00:02:43.780> if

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
that's pretty much it in status bar if

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.740 
that's pretty much it in status bar if
we<00:02:44.470> move<00:02:44.680> on<00:02:44.890> to<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.340> next<00:02:45.370> section<00:02:46.090> toggles

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
we move on to the next section toggles

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.100 
we move on to the next section toggles
this<00:02:47.650> is<00:02:47.830> also<00:02:48.040> a<00:02:48.550> section<00:02:49.420> that<00:02:49.660> you<00:02:49.780> guys<00:02:49.930> are

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
this is also a section that you guys are

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.260 
this is also a section that you guys are
probably<00:02:50.290> used<00:02:50.800> to<00:02:51.010> you<00:02:51.640> could<00:02:51.790> slide<00:02:52.000> through

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
probably used to you could slide through

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.420 
probably used to you could slide through
here<00:02:52.630> and<00:02:52.840> basically<00:02:53.440> move<00:02:53.920> around<00:02:54.190> your

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
here and basically move around your

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.850 
here and basically move around your
toggles<00:02:54.970> swipe<00:02:55.780> away<00:02:55.960> toggles<00:02:56.590> that<00:02:56.770> you

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
toggles swipe away toggles that you

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.070 
toggles swipe away toggles that you
don't<00:02:57.130> want<00:02:57.370> it<00:02:57.940> is<00:02:58.150> a<00:02:58.180> little<00:02:58.420> bit<00:02:58.600> different

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
don't want it is a little bit different

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.740 
don't want it is a little bit different
of<00:02:59.200> a<00:02:59.440> layout<00:02:59.620> then<00:03:00.040> you<00:03:00.370> do<00:03:00.730> get<00:03:00.970> on<00:03:01.180> sandage

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
of a layout then you do get on sandage

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.200 
of a layout then you do get on sandage
ahmad<00:03:02.050> so<00:03:03.040> definitely<00:03:03.490> you<00:03:03.790> could<00:03:04.060> play

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
ahmad so definitely you could play

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.490 
ahmad so definitely you could play
around<00:03:04.420> with<00:03:04.630> that<00:03:04.750> and<00:03:05.050> choose<00:03:05.350> which

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
around with that and choose which

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.800 
around with that and choose which
toggles<00:03:05.800> are<00:03:06.220> important<00:03:06.640> to<00:03:06.730> you<00:03:06.880> could<00:03:07.660> also

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
toggles are important to you could also

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.930 
toggles are important to you could also
change<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.290> toggle<00:03:08.770> style<00:03:09.070> to<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:09.670> to

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
change the toggle style to the to

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.170 
change the toggle style to the to
traditional<00:03:10.780> and<00:03:11.100> either<00:03:12.100> to<00:03:12.520> the<00:03:12.910> one<00:03:13.060> that

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
traditional and either to the one that

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.360 
traditional and either to the one that
we're<00:03:13.330> used<00:03:13.570> to<00:03:13.720> right<00:03:13.990> now<00:03:14.200> and<00:03:14.650> then<00:03:15.160> we<00:03:15.250> get

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
we're used to right now and then we get

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.110 
we're used to right now and then we get
some<00:03:15.580> more<00:03:15.760> options<00:03:16.120> for<00:03:17.550> having<00:03:18.550> contact

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
some more options for having contact

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.210 
some more options for having contact
toggles<00:03:19.630> which<00:03:19.840> I<00:03:20.050> found<00:03:20.290> pretty<00:03:20.440> cool<00:03:20.890> to<00:03:21.100> add

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
toggles which I found pretty cool to add

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.910 
toggles which I found pretty cool to add
your<00:03:21.400> own<00:03:21.430> contact<00:03:22.030> there<00:03:22.470> after<00:03:23.470> that<00:03:23.650> we<00:03:23.770> do

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
your own contact there after that we do

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.580 
your own contact there after that we do
get<00:03:24.100> a<00:03:24.130> navigation<00:03:24.850> ring<00:03:25.090> section<00:03:25.690> and<00:03:25.870> here

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
get a navigation ring section and here

get a navigation ring section and here
in<00:03:26.680> navigation<00:03:27.220> ring<00:03:27.400> we<00:03:27.520> could<00:03:27.700> go<00:03:27.880> ad

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
in navigation ring we could go ad

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.750 
in navigation ring we could go ad
different<00:03:28.630> targets<00:03:29.140> and<00:03:29.380> basically<00:03:30.220> add<00:03:30.550> our

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
different targets and basically add our

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.970 
different targets and basically add our

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
own apps so you can definitely play

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.490 
own apps so you can definitely play
around<00:03:33.280> with<00:03:33.490> that<00:03:33.670> end<00:03:34.060> really<00:03:34.840> customize

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
we get a navigation bar section where we

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.830 
we get a navigation bar section where we
