so imagine this is in the at the end of

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:24.949 
so imagine this is in the at the end of
the<00:01:23.190> mix<00:01:23.429> this<00:01:24.000> choose<00:01:24.270> just<00:01:24.539> played<00:01:24.750> out

00:01:24.949 --> 00:01:24.959 
the mix this choose just played out

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:26.990 
the mix this choose just played out
you've<00:01:25.830> mixed<00:01:26.009> out<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.490> other<00:01:26.610> one<00:01:26.819> and

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
you've forgotten to lower your fader

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.419 
you've forgotten to lower your fader
what<00:01:29.880> happens<00:01:30.500> these<00:01:31.500> track<00:01:31.800> two<00:01:32.039> starts

00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:32.429 
what happens these track two starts

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:33.859 
what happens these track two starts
playing<00:01:32.700> automatically<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:33.750> if<00:01:33.810> you

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
playing automatically so if you

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.600 
playing automatically so if you
forgotten<00:01:34.319> to<00:01:34.470> lower<00:01:34.619> your<00:01:34.830> channel<00:01:35.190> fader<00:01:35.399> or

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
move the cross fader out of the middle

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.719 
move the cross fader out of the middle
position<00:01:37.200> then<00:01:38.009> what<00:01:38.160> you'll<00:01:38.280> find<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:38.700> that

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
position then what you'll find is that

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.820 
position then what you'll find is that
that<00:01:39.000> track<00:01:39.420> starts<00:01:39.929> breaking<00:01:40.200> into<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.619> mix

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
that track starts breaking into the mix

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.040 
that track starts breaking into the mix
and<00:01:41.009> it's<00:01:41.220> kind<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.550> dangerous<00:01:41.810> so<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:42.929> leave

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
and it's kind of dangerous so you leave

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.210 
and it's kind of dangerous so you leave
on<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.259> autocue<00:01:43.619> setting<00:01:46.009> again<00:01:47.009> goes
