question is why would you pick it up and

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.810 
question is why would you pick it up and
I<00:00:51.449> think<00:00:51.720> because<00:00:52.680> it's<00:00:53.040> cheap<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.460> it

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
I think because it's cheap and it

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.090 
I think because it's cheap and it
actually<00:00:53.970> plays<00:00:54.360> okay<00:00:54.809> I've<00:00:55.199> had<00:00:55.439> slightly

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
actually plays okay I've had slightly

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.130 
actually plays okay I've had slightly
more<00:00:56.369> expensive<00:00:56.460> guitars<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.629> I've<00:00:57.869> fooled

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
more expensive guitars that I've fooled

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.560 
more expensive guitars that I've fooled
around<00:00:58.350> with<00:00:58.619> it<00:00:58.890> stayed<00:00:59.159> in<00:00:59.309> tune<00:00:59.580> less<00:01:00.210> well

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
around with it stayed in tune less well

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.859 
around with it stayed in tune less well
than<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:01.189> it's<00:01:02.189> nylon<00:01:02.430> string<00:01:03.089> and<00:01:03.330> I<00:01:03.600> think

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:03.869 
than this it's nylon string and I think

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:06.260
