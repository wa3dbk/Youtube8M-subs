conversion<00:00:16.630> today<00:00:17.080> we're<00:00:17.199> going<00:00:17.289> to<00:00:17.350> be

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.500 
conversion today we're going to be

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.900 
conversion today we're going to be
talking<00:00:17.680> about<00:00:17.859> a<00:00:18.039> bunch<00:00:18.310> of<00:00:18.400> sick<00:00:18.640> things

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:18.910 
talking about a bunch of sick things

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.130 
talking about a bunch of sick things
that<00:00:19.060> you<00:00:19.119> could<00:00:19.269> do<00:00:19.359> an<00:00:19.480> inversion<00:00:19.810> and

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
that you could do an inversion and

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.769 
that you could do an inversion and
specifically<00:00:21.070> staying<00:00:21.939> on<00:00:22.089> topic<00:00:22.359> for

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:22.779 
specifically staying on topic for

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:25.499 
specifically staying on topic for
defensive<00:00:23.470> strategies<00:00:24.099> so<00:00:24.699> Ken<00:00:24.939> let's<00:00:25.240> jump

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:25.509 
defensive strategies so Ken let's jump

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:26.999 
defensive strategies so Ken let's jump
into<00:00:25.659> it<00:00:25.900> one<00:00:26.050> of<00:00:26.140> the<00:00:26.199> basic<00:00:26.529> things<00:00:26.560> that<00:00:26.890> we

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:27.009 
into it one of the basic things that we

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:29.909 
into it one of the basic things that we
have<00:00:27.279> is<00:00:27.489> a<00:00:28.150> destructible<00:00:28.869> cover<00:00:29.199> system<00:00:29.470> ok

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:29.919 
have is a destructible cover system ok

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:31.589 
have is a destructible cover system ok
so<00:00:29.980> because<00:00:30.400> inversion<00:00:30.880> is<00:00:31.029> third<00:00:31.269> person

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:31.599 
so because inversion is third person

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.360 
so because inversion is third person
cover<00:00:32.050> based<00:00:32.290> shooter<00:00:32.439> covers<00:00:33.040> the<00:00:33.160> first

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
cover based shooter covers the first

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.800 
cover based shooter covers the first
base<00:00:33.790> mechanic<00:00:34.300> that<00:00:34.329> everybody's<00:00:34.720> gonna

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:34.810 
base mechanic that everybody's gonna

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.600 
base mechanic that everybody's gonna
have<00:00:34.930> to<00:00:35.020> get<00:00:35.140> used<00:00:35.320> to<00:00:35.530> think<00:00:36.100> about<00:00:36.250> our<00:00:36.400> game

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
have to get used to think about our game

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.800 
have to get used to think about our game
because<00:00:36.940> we<00:00:37.090> have<00:00:37.180> destructible<00:00:37.630> cover

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:37.810 
because we have destructible cover

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.930 
because we have destructible cover
enemies<00:00:38.710> are<00:00:39.010> going<00:00:39.340> to<00:00:39.400> sit<00:00:39.610> there<00:00:39.790> and

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
enemies are going to sit there and

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.070 
enemies are going to sit there and
they're<00:00:40.090> going<00:00:40.180> to<00:00:40.240> whittle<00:00:40.480> away<00:00:40.540> your<00:00:40.840> cover

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.080 
they're going to whittle away your cover

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.810 
they're going to whittle away your cover
when<00:00:41.650> that<00:00:41.770> starts<00:00:41.950> to<00:00:41.980> wear<00:00:42.130> down<00:00:42.190> you're

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
when that starts to wear down you're

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:43.800 
when that starts to wear down you're
gonna<00:00:42.940> find<00:00:43.090> that<00:00:43.240> you<00:00:43.300> going<00:00:43.420> to<00:00:43.480> take<00:00:43.600> damage

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:43.810 
gonna find that you going to take damage

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.030 
gonna find that you going to take damage
so<00:00:44.020> you<00:00:44.080> have<00:00:44.290> to<00:00:44.410> keep<00:00:44.590> moving<00:00:44.710> we're

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
so you have to keep moving we're

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.950 
so you have to keep moving we're
encouraging<00:00:45.460> the<00:00:45.580> player<00:00:45.790> to<00:00:46.390> go<00:00:46.540> and<00:00:46.690> explore

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
encouraging the player to go and explore

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.350 
encouraging the player to go and explore
the<00:00:47.080> battlefield<00:00:47.500> find<00:00:48.190> additional<00:00:48.700> areas<00:00:49.240> to

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
the battlefield find additional areas to

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.150 
the battlefield find additional areas to
take<00:00:49.510> cover<00:00:49.690> from<00:00:49.960> and<00:00:50.410> then<00:00:50.800> hopefully<00:00:50.920> take

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
take cover from and then hopefully take

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.160 
take cover from and then hopefully take
advantage<00:00:51.550> of<00:00:51.640> the<00:00:51.760> fight

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.810 

now<00:00:57.739> next<00:00:58.039> big<00:00:58.250> thing<00:00:58.460> that<00:00:58.489> we<00:00:58.670> definitely

want to talk about and super brand new

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:03.700 
want to talk about and super brand new
to<00:01:01.670> the<00:01:01.760> world<00:01:01.879> of<00:01:02.089> inversion<00:01:02.600> is<00:01:02.809> mobile

cover<00:01:04.040> all<00:01:04.489> right<00:01:04.610> mol<00:01:04.850> cover<00:01:05.150> is<00:01:05.390> just

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
cover all right mol cover is just

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:07.870 
cover all right mol cover is just
another<00:01:05.930> way<00:01:06.350> that<00:01:06.380> we<00:01:06.680> let<00:01:06.890> the<00:01:06.950> player<00:01:07.159> user

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
another way that we let the player user

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.940 
another way that we let the player user
graveling<00:01:08.360> customize<00:01:09.110> a<00:01:09.140> game<00:01:09.409> let<00:01:09.619> them<00:01:09.740> play

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
graveling customize a game let them play

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.010 
graveling customize a game let them play
how<00:01:10.189> they<00:01:10.310> want<00:01:10.430> to<00:01:10.549> play<00:01:10.700> so<00:01:11.270> for<00:01:11.509> example<00:01:11.600> i

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
how they want to play so for example i

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.260 
how they want to play so for example i
can<00:01:12.080> grab<00:01:12.409> any<00:01:12.740> of<00:01:12.860> these<00:01:12.920> objects<00:01:13.430> throw<00:01:14.119> any

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
can grab any of these objects throw any

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.460 
can grab any of these objects throw any
of<00:01:14.330> these<00:01:14.420> objects<00:01:14.810> that<00:01:14.899> are<00:01:15.020> in<00:01:15.110> the<00:01:15.170> level

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
of these objects that are in the level

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.529 
of these objects that are in the level
in<00:01:15.590> the<00:01:15.619> low<00:01:15.799> gravity<00:01:15.979> i<00:01:16.399> can<00:01:16.909> grab<00:01:17.149> it<00:01:17.180> and<00:01:17.450> i

00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:17.539 
in the low gravity i can grab it and i

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:19.120 
in the low gravity i can grab it and i
can<00:01:17.690> use<00:01:17.840> that<00:01:17.960> to<00:01:18.020> manually<00:01:18.500> deflect<00:01:18.890> shots

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
can use that to manually deflect shots

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.889 
can use that to manually deflect shots
now<00:01:19.369> use<00:01:19.789> the<00:01:19.880> right<00:01:20.030> analog<00:01:20.270> stick<00:01:20.390> move<00:01:20.810> it

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
now use the right analog stick move it

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.260 
now use the right analog stick move it
up<00:01:21.080> move<00:01:21.289> it<00:01:21.470> down<00:01:21.680> left<00:01:21.950> right<00:01:22.070> so<00:01:22.670> you<00:01:23.180> know

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
up move it down left right so you know

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.730 
up move it down left right so you know
you're<00:01:23.450> used<00:01:23.689> to<00:01:23.810> covers<00:01:24.140> being<00:01:24.380> there<00:01:24.619> you

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
you're used to covers being there you

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.440 
you're used to covers being there you
just<00:01:24.860> have<00:01:24.979> a<00:01:25.130> look<00:01:25.369> for<00:01:25.430> a<00:01:25.670> move<00:01:25.970> from<00:01:26.090> spot<00:01:26.420> to

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
just have a look for a move from spot to

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.169 
just have a look for a move from spot to
spot<00:01:26.600> but<00:01:27.259> in<00:01:27.380> version<00:01:27.830> we<00:01:28.520> give<00:01:28.759> you<00:01:29.000> the

00:01:29.169 --> 00:01:29.179 
spot but in version we give you the

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:31.840 
spot but in version we give you the
ability<00:01:29.300> to<00:01:29.690> create<00:01:30.380> your<00:01:30.409> own<00:01:30.619> so<00:01:31.220> being<00:01:31.759> able

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
ability to create your own so being able

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.450 
ability to create your own so being able
to<00:01:32.000> create<00:01:32.240> cover<00:01:32.479> is<00:01:32.720> another<00:01:33.170> example<00:01:33.460> what

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
to create cover is another example what

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.770 
to create cover is another example what
the<00:01:34.550> graphing<00:01:34.880> to<00:01:34.970> do<00:01:35.119> right<00:01:35.360> can<00:01:35.479> do<00:01:35.569> all

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
the graphing to do right can do all

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.359 
the graphing to do right can do all
these<00:01:35.899> different<00:01:36.080> cool<00:01:36.319> things<00:01:36.590> so<00:01:37.220> we've<00:01:37.340> set

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
these different cool things so we've set

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.910 
these different cool things so we've set
up<00:01:37.549> these<00:01:37.759> cool<00:01:38.409> firefights<00:01:39.409> we<00:01:39.590> cut<00:01:39.740> up<00:01:39.830> these

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
up these cool firefights we cut up these

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.620 
up these cool firefights we cut up these
cool<00:01:40.159> scenarios<00:01:40.549> where<00:01:40.729> there's<00:01:40.880> no<00:01:41.119> cover<00:01:41.420> at

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
cool scenarios where there's no cover at

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.600 
cool scenarios where there's no cover at

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
all you can run around it's completely

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.639

way<00:01:45.920> in<00:01:46.190> the<00:01:46.280> back<00:01:46.429> but<00:01:46.700> you<00:01:46.789> got<00:01:46.909> to<00:01:46.940> find<00:01:47.179> some

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
way in the back but you got to find some

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
way to bridge that gap it to where you

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:52.449 
are and get to where they are to kill so
we<00:01:51.409> do<00:01:51.530> that<00:01:51.679> by<00:01:51.830> letting<00:01:52.009> you<00:01:52.130> create<00:01:52.310> your

we do that by letting you create your

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:54.999 
we do that by letting you create your

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
want to talk about today is the

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.910 
want to talk about today is the
shockwave<00:02:01.750> shockwave<00:02:02.750> is<00:02:02.930> awesome<00:02:03.409> it's<00:02:03.590> it's

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
shockwave shockwave is awesome it's it's

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.560 
shockwave shockwave is awesome it's it's
what<00:02:04.070> everybody<00:02:04.430> means<00:02:04.909> to<00:02:05.030> do<00:02:05.149> the<00:02:05.359> first

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
what everybody means to do the first

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.690 
what everybody means to do the first
time<00:02:05.780> they<00:02:05.990> pick<00:02:06.170> up<00:02:06.320> this<00:02:06.439> game<00:02:06.710> and<00:02:07.039> what's

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
time they pick up this game and what's

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.400 
time they pick up this game and what's
really<00:02:08.030> awesome<00:02:08.060> about<00:02:08.420> this<00:02:08.630> is<00:02:08.959> that<00:02:08.989> as

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
really awesome about this is that as

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.229 
really awesome about this is that as
much<00:02:09.619> as<00:02:09.649> it<00:02:09.979> can<00:02:10.160> be<00:02:10.340> used<00:02:10.459> as<00:02:10.700> an<00:02:10.850> offensive

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
much as it can be used as an offensive

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.270 
much as it can be used as an offensive
weapon<00:02:11.299> the<00:02:12.079> defensive<00:02:12.530> strategies<00:02:13.010> that<00:02:13.220> can

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
weapon the defensive strategies that can

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.670 
weapon the defensive strategies that can
evolve<00:02:13.670> from<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.299> use<00:02:14.540> of<00:02:14.570> the<00:02:14.810> shockwave<00:02:15.290> are

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
evolve from the use of the shockwave are

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.860 
evolve from the use of the shockwave are
almost<00:02:16.040> endless<00:02:16.280> so<00:02:16.820> the<00:02:16.910> shockwave<00:02:17.359> is<00:02:17.720> an

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
almost endless so the shockwave is an

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.599 
almost endless so the shockwave is an
ability<00:02:18.140> as<00:02:18.440> a<00:02:18.470> gravity<00:02:18.920> billet<00:02:19.220> that<00:02:19.340> you<00:02:19.489> can

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:19.609 
ability as a gravity billet that you can

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:21.699 
ability as a gravity billet that you can
use<00:02:19.730> from<00:02:19.910> your<00:02:20.030> graveling<00:02:20.359> device<00:02:20.690> again<00:02:21.560> you

can kind of use it it's primarily used

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.270
