what's<00:02:16.590> more<00:02:16.769> the<00:02:16.920> camera<00:02:17.250> can<00:02:17.400> shoot<00:02:17.640> up<00:02:17.790> to

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
what's more the camera can shoot up to

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.699 
what's more the camera can shoot up to
three<00:02:18.150> frames<00:02:18.480> per<00:02:18.720> second<00:02:19.170> which<00:02:19.349> is<00:02:19.379> less

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
three frames per second which is less

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.790 
three frames per second which is less
than<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.040> Nikon<00:02:20.430> d3300<00:02:21.300> that<00:02:21.870> captures<00:02:22.319> five

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
than the Nikon d3300 that captures five

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.190 
than the Nikon d3300 that captures five
frames<00:02:23.099> per<00:02:23.280> second<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:24.180> camera<00:02:24.510> sensitivity

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
frames per second the camera sensitivity

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.130 
frames per second the camera sensitivity
range<00:02:25.379> runs<00:02:25.709> from<00:02:25.890> ISO<00:02:26.280> 100<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.879> 6400<00:02:27.360> which

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
range runs from ISO 100 to 6400 which

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.309 
range runs from ISO 100 to 6400 which
can<00:02:28.349> be<00:02:28.440> expanded<00:02:28.769> to<00:02:28.980> ISO<00:02:29.599> 12800<00:02:30.599> but<00:02:30.930> we

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
can be expanded to ISO 12800 but we

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.830 
can be expanded to ISO 12800 but we
won't<00:02:31.530> recommend<00:02:31.830> that<00:02:32.129> the<00:02:33.120> camera<00:02:33.480> is<00:02:33.629> also

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
won't recommend that the camera is also

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.780 
won't recommend that the camera is also
capable<00:02:34.110> of<00:02:34.379> full<00:02:34.620> HD<00:02:34.890> video<00:02:35.129> recording<00:02:35.610> with

the<00:02:35.879> added<00:02:36.209> bonus<00:02:36.330> of<00:02:36.599> having<00:02:36.660> full<00:02:37.170> manual

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
the added bonus of having full manual

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.320 
the added bonus of having full manual
control<00:02:37.560> during<00:02:38.129> the<00:02:38.220> recording<00:02:38.640> something

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
control during the recording something

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.619 
control during the recording something
