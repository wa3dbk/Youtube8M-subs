explored give a day which gave me a

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.040 
explored give a day which gave me a
really<00:05:01.250> good<00:05:01.370> pump<00:05:01.760> this<00:05:02.419> a<00:05:02.570> lot<00:05:02.780> to<00:05:02.900> live<00:05:02.990> up

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
really good pump this a lot to live up

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.250 
really good pump this a lot to live up
to<00:05:03.350> so<00:05:03.880> unfortunately<00:05:04.880> it<00:05:05.360> doesn't<00:05:05.930> mean<00:05:06.169> the

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
to so unfortunately it doesn't mean the

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.480 
to so unfortunately it doesn't mean the
standard<00:05:06.880> what<00:05:07.880> the<00:05:07.970> previous<00:05:08.270> one<00:05:08.419> set<00:05:08.690> and

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
standard what the previous one set and

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.280 
standard what the previous one set and
so<00:05:10.490> for<00:05:10.669> that<00:05:10.700> got<00:05:11.150> over<00:05:11.450> oscar<00:05:11.570> are<00:05:11.870> six<00:05:12.140> out
