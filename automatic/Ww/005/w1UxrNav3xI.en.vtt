00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
they take that into account when they

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.059 
they take that into account when they
design<00:02:08.879> their<00:02:09.209> their<00:02:10.730> phone

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069

one<00:02:33.280> I<00:02:33.489> didn't<00:02:34.000> find<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.359> Xperia<00:02:35.049> whatever

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
one I didn't find the Xperia whatever

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.679 
one I didn't find the Xperia whatever
whatever<00:02:36.340> I<00:02:36.430> just<00:02:36.730> looked<00:02:36.909> at<00:02:37.090> it<00:02:37.269> and<00:02:37.480> then

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:37.689 
whatever I just looked at it and then

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:40.080 
whatever I just looked at it and then
ordered<00:02:38.409> the<00:02:38.590> same<00:02:38.980> thing<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:39.430> it's<00:02:39.909> the

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
ordered the same thing and it's the

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.819 
ordered the same thing and it's the
exact<00:02:40.450> same<00:02:41.219> same<00:02:42.219> thing<00:02:42.519> so<00:02:43.079> you<00:02:44.079> know<00:02:44.230> it's

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
exact same same thing so you know it's

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:51.659 
exact same same thing so you know it's
the<00:02:45.370> fight<00:02:46.920> for<00:02:47.920> I<00:02:48.659> know<00:02:49.659> the<00:02:50.379> idea<00:02:50.620> that<00:02:50.669> let's

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:51.669 
the fight for I know the idea that let's

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:54.300 
the fight for I know the idea that let's
say<00:02:51.819> the<00:02:52.030> the<00:02:52.060> eBay<00:02:52.629> sellers<00:02:53.590> they<00:02:54.069> will<00:02:54.189> not

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
say the the eBay sellers they will not

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.460 
say the the eBay sellers they will not
be<00:02:54.459> able<00:02:54.609> to<00:02:54.790> put<00:02:55.060> all<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:55.359> models<00:02:55.689> it's

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
be able to put all the models it's

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.619 
be able to put all the models it's
compatible<00:02:56.859> with<00:02:57.159> because<00:02:57.489> it's<00:02:57.669> like<00:02:57.849> a<00:02:57.879> huge

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
compatible with because it's like a huge

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:00.860 
compatible with because it's like a huge
job<00:02:58.930> and<00:02:59.319> it's<00:03:00.099> never<00:03:00.340> going<00:03:00.579> to<00:03:00.669> be<00:03:00.730> a

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
job and it's never going to be a

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.229 
job and it's never going to be a
complete<00:03:01.870> list<00:03:02.079> because<00:03:02.859> every<00:03:03.159> day<00:03:03.909> there's

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
complete list because every day there's

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.990 
complete list because every day there's
new<00:03:04.480> phones<00:03:04.810> on<00:03:05.079> the<00:03:05.169> market<00:03:05.200> so<00:03:05.680> now<00:03:06.549> just<00:03:06.879> to

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:00.419 
them so I saw some guy just placed the

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:04.020 
them so I saw some guy just placed the
the<00:04:01.419> SIM<00:04:02.139> card<00:04:02.169> reader<00:04:02.590> on<00:04:02.859> top<00:04:03.310> of<00:04:03.489> it<00:04:03.609> and

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
the SIM card reader on top of it and

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.110 
the SIM card reader on top of it and
then<00:04:04.479> he<00:04:04.629> goes<00:04:04.870> underneath<00:04:05.680> with<00:04:06.280> a<00:04:06.310> heat<00:04:06.760> gun

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
then he goes underneath with a heat gun

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.069 
then he goes underneath with a heat gun
and<00:04:07.329> then<00:04:07.870> heats<00:04:08.229> up<00:04:08.439> the<00:04:08.680> board<00:04:09.479> and<00:04:10.479> expects

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079 
and then heats up the board and expects

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:13.679 
and then heats up the board and expects
this<00:04:11.229> to<00:04:11.500> weld<00:04:12.040> up<00:04:12.250> in<00:04:12.459> place<00:04:12.699> that's<00:04:13.209> crazy

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:13.689 
this to weld up in place that's crazy

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:16.170 
this to weld up in place that's crazy
because<00:04:13.930> before<00:04:14.530> this<00:04:14.739> will<00:04:14.949> weld<00:04:15.310> up<00:04:15.609> on<00:04:15.879> the

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
because before this will weld up on the

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.699 
because before this will weld up on the
other<00:04:16.269> side<00:04:16.690> he<00:04:17.049> will<00:04:17.169> lose<00:04:17.380> all<00:04:17.560> your

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
other side he will lose all your

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.360 
other side he will lose all your
components<00:04:18.209> is<00:04:19.209> stupid<00:04:19.720> to<00:04:19.930> to<00:04:20.130> heat<00:04:21.130> it<00:04:21.250> up

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
components is stupid to to heat it up

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.399 
components is stupid to to heat it up
like<00:04:21.609> that<00:04:21.639> as<00:04:21.969> no<00:04:22.450> way<00:04:22.690> is<00:04:22.810> going<00:04:22.960> to<00:04:23.020> work

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:23.409 
like that as no way is going to work

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:25.180 
like that as no way is going to work
leave<00:04:23.950> the<00:04:24.159> way<00:04:24.279> to<00:04:24.340> work<00:04:24.669> it<00:04:24.849> is

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
leave the way to work it is

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.180 
leave the way to work it is
to<00:04:25.340> heat<00:04:25.580> evenly<00:04:26.260> underneath<00:04:27.260> the<00:04:28.160> the

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
to heat evenly underneath the the

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.000 
to heat evenly underneath the the
motherboard<00:04:28.910> I<00:04:29.320> don't<00:04:30.320> know<00:04:30.380> something<00:04:30.860> to

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
motherboard I don't know something to

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.890 
motherboard I don't know something to
200<00:04:31.520> degrees<00:04:31.850> or<00:04:32.030> some<00:04:32.180> like<00:04:32.330> that<00:04:32.360> not<00:04:32.690> to<00:04:32.780> the

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
200 degrees or some like that not to the

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.920 
200 degrees or some like that not to the
melting<00:04:33.320> point<00:04:33.590> and<00:04:33.830> then<00:04:35.920> you<00:04:36.920> just<00:04:37.870> try<00:04:38.870> to

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
melting point and then you just try to

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:45.640 
melting point and then you just try to
weld<00:04:39.920> each<00:04:40.280> and<00:04:40.640> every<00:04:41.830> point<00:04:44.050> contact<00:04:45.050> you

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
weld each and every point contact you

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.940 
weld each and every point contact you
know<00:04:45.800> we<00:04:46.040> have<00:04:46.190> a<00:04:46.600> three<00:04:47.600> here<00:04:47.930> and<00:04:48.170> I'm<00:04:48.620> three
