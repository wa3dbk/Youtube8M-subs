00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 My name is Amanda and I am 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.160
 aesthetic area and a lot of 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.529
 people ask me about the 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.750
 brushing cats any importance 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.450
 one must do if one must with 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.059
 frequency of cat brushing should be 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.250
 be made regardless of the size and 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.619
 amount of weight is medium or 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.760
 whereas this mainly influences 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.130
 animal health 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.170
 the cat he's landing all the time 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.500
 consequently he ingests mp 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.650
 so the more you brush - by the 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.730
 Your little brother is going to go ingesting 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.969
 This is Bob. 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.460
 my eldest son and it's a cat to have 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.620
 considered by the media that it should be 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.440
 brushed and at least three times in the 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.360
 to withdraw this by the other and 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.510
 by which it is falling through the house including 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.550
 which will significantly reduce this 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.980
 falling from gall is a matter of routine 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.870
 You have to accustom your place to 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.430
 Doing this will not be the first time. 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.660
 that you will take your place that he 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.850
 will be quiet 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.980
 so it's a matter of everyday in 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.470
 a little bit just a little bit of water 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.200
 a little of the other is you discover which 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.600
 is the most comfortable way for you and 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.000
 for him at last position 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.420
 then this vaccine should be done all 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.330
 body including the tail, very careful 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.480
 the muzzle until the board does 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.730
 are the backyard works is to avoid 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:27.020
 any kind of accident like flax 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:30.170
 a little video of them then brush 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.360
 your cat towards and against the direction 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.940
 the pew indicated that I used for this 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.100
 So move command was from here that model 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.660
 what is called a rocker you go 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.480
 find any shock from your 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.970
 I recommend preference for small 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.040
 be the size of the cat to be more 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.070
 easy you with a tummy in low 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.010
 the arms finally recommend it 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.400
 but if you have wood at home 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:57.320
 tried any type of comb until it was done 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.330
 that they give salon to me. 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.370
 opinion you may also be 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.460
 taking care that you take an amount 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.560
 of God but the chairs are 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.500
 The better the more you close your 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.320
 cat - mothers needed cat 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.660
 very clean animal are taking these 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.150
 climb by theirs as dead 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.980
 it will become easier to sanitize it 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.540
 Another thing that is important is the focus on you. 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.000
 will form you can preview 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.519
 any type of injury of any kind 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.769
 injury that you have on your cat's skin and 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.380
 is dealing in advance then 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:31.420
 This is very important. 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.580
 this closer contact then people 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.040
 that was my brushing tip as 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.540
 Area professional as mother of cat 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.190
