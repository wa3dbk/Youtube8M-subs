eyeing from not just manufacturing here
in<00:00:38.640> China<00:00:38.879> but<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.120> India<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.570> action<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:40.050> when

in China but in India to action I when
this<00:00:40.649> car<00:00:40.829> starts<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.190> roll<00:00:41.340> out<00:00:41.460> from<00:00:41.730> the

this car starts to roll out from the
chennai<00:00:42.570> plant<00:00:42.629> early<00:00:43.170> next<00:00:43.530> year<00:00:43.680> we<00:00:44.040> are

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
chennai plant early next year we are

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.380 
chennai plant early next year we are
thinking<00:00:44.399> perhaps<00:00:44.610> January<00:00:45.270> that's

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
thinking perhaps January that's

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.209 
thinking perhaps January that's
indication<00:00:45.960> we<00:00:46.079> have<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.800> front<00:00:47.010> is<00:00:47.100> where

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
indication we have in the front is where

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.410 
indication we have in the front is where
you<00:00:47.280> can<00:00:47.370> actually<00:00:47.489> see<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.910> similarities

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
you can actually see the similarities

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.299 
you can actually see the similarities
with<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.600> Fiesta<00:00:49.050> because<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.469> overall<00:00:49.980> dash

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
with the Fiesta because the overall dash

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.100 
with the Fiesta because the overall dash
design<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:50.969> layout<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.480> in<00:00:51.600> fact<00:00:51.809> even<00:00:52.020> the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
design and layout and in fact even the

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.380 
design and layout and in fact even the
feature<00:00:52.379> list<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:53.070> similar<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.940> Fiesta

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
feature list is similar to the Fiesta

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.360 
feature list is similar to the Fiesta
and<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:54.930> that's<00:00:55.379> where<00:00:55.590> again<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.980> cost

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
and so that's where again the cost

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.920 
and so that's where again the cost
savings<00:00:56.610> will<00:00:56.969> come<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.480> shared<00:00:57.719> platform

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
savings will come in the shared platform

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.170 
savings will come in the shared platform
