00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:35.829 
what people are going to understand is

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:36.779 
what people are going to understand is
they're<00:00:35.920> going<00:00:36.010> to<00:00:36.100> say<00:00:36.219> it's<00:00:36.339> a<00:00:36.370> natural

00:00:36.779 --> 00:00:36.789 
they're going to say it's a natural

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:38.669 
they're going to say it's a natural
cycle<00:00:37.059> of<00:00:37.390> things<00:00:37.660> and<00:00:38.019> I<00:00:38.050> understand<00:00:38.530> all

00:00:38.669 --> 00:00:38.679 
cycle of things and I understand all

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:42.689 
cycle of things and I understand all
that<00:00:38.890> but<00:00:39.129> it's<00:00:40.170> 2011<00:00:41.170> and<00:00:41.710> even<00:00:42.429> though<00:00:42.519> it's

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:42.699 
that but it's 2011 and even though it's

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:45.809 
that but it's 2011 and even though it's
a<00:00:42.789> universal<00:00:43.420> 4-year<00:00:44.140> still<00:00:45.129> haves<00:00:45.280> the<00:00:45.370> 11<00:00:45.730> on

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:45.819 
a universal 4-year still haves the 11 on

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:48.450 
a universal 4-year still haves the 11 on
the<00:00:45.909> back<00:00:46.059> end<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:47.379> I've<00:00:47.649> told<00:00:47.890> people<00:00:48.010> many

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
the back end and I've told people many

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.340 
the back end and I've told people many
times<00:00:48.550> with<00:00:48.969> that<00:00:49.089> 11<00:00:49.449> means<00:00:49.659> it's<00:00:49.989> it's

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
times with that 11 means it's it's

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.799 
times with that 11 means it's it's
basically<00:00:50.739> a<00:00:51.010> very<00:00:51.129> very<00:00:51.940> very<00:00:52.269> strong

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
basically a very very very strong

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.639 
basically a very very very strong
vibrational<00:00:53.620> energy<00:00:53.979> and<00:00:55.289> whenever<00:00:56.289> you<00:00:56.440> see

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
vibrational energy and whenever you see

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.169 
vibrational energy and whenever you see
Elevens<00:00:57.069> around<00:00:57.370> and<00:00:57.579> like<00:00:57.670> you<00:00:57.789> know<00:00:57.909> I'm

00:00:58.169 --> 00:00:58.179 
Elevens around and like you know I'm

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:01.169 
Elevens around and like you know I'm
going<00:00:58.929> through<00:00:59.050> this<00:00:59.109> for<00:00:59.260> a<00:00:59.319> second<00:00:59.769> 911<00:01:00.179> you

00:01:01.169 --> 00:01:01.179 
going through this for a second 911 you

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:02.729 
going through this for a second 911 you
know<00:01:01.269> the<00:01:01.389> first<00:01:01.569> plane<00:01:01.929> the<00:01:02.079> hit<00:01:02.260> you<00:01:02.589> know

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
know the first plane the hit you know

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.240 
know the first plane the hit you know
nine<00:01:03.069> nine<00:01:03.339> eleven<00:01:03.850> was<00:01:04.509> flight<00:01:04.930> 11<00:01:05.530> well<00:01:06.130> it's

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
nine nine eleven was flight 11 well it's

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.969 
nine nine eleven was flight 11 well it's
a<00:01:06.310> joke<00:01:06.549> what<00:01:06.790> goes<00:01:06.969> on<00:01:07.180> New<00:01:08.049> York<00:01:08.259> City<00:01:08.590> eleven

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
a joke what goes on New York City eleven

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:10.459 
a joke what goes on New York City eleven
letters<00:01:09.130> Afghanistan<00:01:09.939> eleven<00:01:10.299> letters

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:10.469

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
pentagon eleven letters the day we

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.440 
pentagon eleven letters the day we
attacked<00:01:13.329> Afghanistan<00:01:14.259> in<00:01:15.040> retaliation<00:01:15.759> for

9/11 yet right but anyways it happened

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.359 
9/11 yet right but anyways it happened
on<00:01:19.210> 10<00:01:19.600> 7<00:01:20.140> 2001<00:01:20.860> take<00:01:21.159> out<00:01:21.310> zeros<00:01:21.789> 1<00:01:22.509> 7<00:01:23.020> 2<00:01:23.369> 1

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
on 10 7 2001 take out zeros 1 7 2 1

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.770 
on 10 7 2001 take out zeros 1 7 2 1
again<00:01:24.789> 11<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:26.560> I'm<00:01:26.799> expecting<00:01:27.430> a<00:01:27.939> lot<00:01:28.479> of<00:01:28.659> big

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
again 11 so I'm expecting a lot of big

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.660 
again 11 so I'm expecting a lot of big
events<00:01:28.810> and<00:01:29.469> I<00:01:29.530> just<00:01:29.950> thought<00:01:30.100> you<00:01:30.340> know<00:01:30.369> make

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
events and I just thought you know make

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.639 
events and I just thought you know make
a<00:01:30.700> just<00:01:31.570> tell<00:01:31.719> you<00:01:31.840> about<00:01:31.930> a<00:01:32.079> few<00:01:32.350> of<00:01:32.409> them<00:01:32.619> that

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
a just tell you about a few of them that

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:35.399 
a just tell you about a few of them that
I<00:01:32.799> think<00:01:32.950> it's<00:01:33.189> going<00:01:33.310> to<00:01:33.369> happen<00:01:34.200> number<00:01:35.200> one

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
I think it's going to happen number one

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.120 
I think it's going to happen number one
thing<00:01:35.619> I<00:01:35.710> see<00:01:35.920> happening<00:01:36.369> is<00:01:36.789> I<00:01:37.740> hate<00:01:38.740> to<00:01:38.890> say

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
thing I see happening is I hate to say

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.359 
thing I see happening is I hate to say
to<00:01:39.189> you<00:01:39.460> to<00:01:39.850> my<00:01:40.000> friends<00:01:40.390> up<00:01:40.539> north<00:01:40.570> but<00:01:41.369> Canada

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
to you to my friends up north but Canada

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.060 
to you to my friends up north but Canada
you<00:01:42.820> know<00:01:42.850> you<00:01:43.030> guys<00:01:43.539> kind<00:01:44.200> of<00:01:44.350> escape<00:01:44.890> the

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
you know you guys kind of escape the

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.859 
you know you guys kind of escape the
recession<00:01:45.670> not<00:01:45.939> as<00:01:46.149> good<00:01:46.329> as<00:01:46.420> trying<00:01:46.719> to

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
recession not as good as trying to

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.080 
recession not as good as trying to
obviously<00:01:47.070> you're<00:01:48.070> not<00:01:48.159> an<00:01:48.340> economic<00:01:48.520> boom

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
obviously you're not an economic boom

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.090 
obviously you're not an economic boom
but<00:01:49.450> you're<00:01:49.869> not<00:01:49.990> hurting<00:01:50.439> like<00:01:50.649> the<00:01:50.770> United

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
but you're not hurting like the United

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.889 
but you're not hurting like the United
States<00:01:51.340> has<00:01:51.549> since<00:01:52.450> 2008<00:01:53.200> but<00:01:53.590> yeah<00:01:54.750> 2011<00:01:55.750> is

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
States has since 2008 but yeah 2011 is

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.760 
States has since 2008 but yeah 2011 is
your<00:01:56.079> ear<00:01:56.320> can<00:01:56.890> de<00:01:57.240> those<00:01:58.240> housing<00:01:58.780> prices<00:01:59.499> are

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
your ear can de those housing prices are

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.899 
your ear can de those housing prices are
