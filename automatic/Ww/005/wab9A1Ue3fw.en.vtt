00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
and a half inch cuts is another common

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.590 
and a half inch cuts is another common
use<00:01:57.020> so<00:01:57.890> those<00:01:58.100> are<00:01:58.250> labeled<00:01:58.610> with<00:01:58.820> stars<00:01:59.210> so<00:01:59.570> I

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
use so those are labeled with stars so I

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.719 
use so those are labeled with stars so I
know<00:01:59.780> exactly<00:02:00.079> where<00:02:00.590> to<00:02:00.650> put<00:02:00.890> my<00:02:01.310> rotary

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
lined up with the black line so I've got

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.199 
lined up with the black line so I've got
my<00:02:13.430> fabric<00:02:13.849> folded<00:02:14.420> here

so we're going to start off by go ahead
and<00:04:44.600> cutting<00:04:45.050> that<00:04:45.230> zero<00:04:45.680> and<00:04:46.100> then<00:04:47.090> I'm<00:04:47.360> gonna

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
and cutting that zero and then I'm gonna

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:48.850 
and cutting that zero and then I'm gonna
slide<00:04:47.690> this<00:04:47.810> up<00:04:47.960> just<00:04:47.990> a<00:04:48.230> little<00:04:48.290> bit<00:04:48.530> cuz<00:04:48.800> I

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
slide this up just a little bit cuz I

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:49.960 
slide this up just a little bit cuz I
didn't<00:04:49.040> get<00:04:49.130> all<00:04:49.250> the<00:04:49.340> way<00:04:49.430> up<00:04:49.580> to<00:04:49.700> the<00:04:49.820> top

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
didn't get all the way up to the top

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.670 
didn't get all the way up to the top
because<00:04:50.090> this<00:04:50.270> is<00:04:50.420> a<00:04:50.450> full<00:04:50.840> piece<00:04:51.140> of<00:04:51.380> fabric

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
because this is a full piece of fabric

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.460 
because this is a full piece of fabric
all<00:04:52.220> the<00:04:52.280> way<00:04:52.810> from<00:04:53.810> one<00:04:53.960> end<00:04:53.990> to<00:04:54.260> the<00:04:54.350> other

all the way from one end to the other

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.600 
all the way from one end to the other
there<00:04:55.070> we<00:04:55.160> go<00:04:55.310> and<00:04:55.490> then<00:04:55.910> ten<00:04:56.270> inches<00:04:56.720> and<00:04:57.610> then

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
there we go and then ten inches and then

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.340 
there we go and then ten inches and then
twenty<00:04:59.150> inches<00:05:00.550> there<00:05:01.550> we<00:05:01.700> go<00:05:01.820> so<00:05:02.270> now<00:05:02.510> what<00:05:03.230> we

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
twenty inches there we go so now what we

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.830 
twenty inches there we go so now what we
can<00:05:03.500> do<00:05:03.680> is<00:05:03.890> turn<00:05:04.130> the<00:05:04.340> fabric<00:05:04.850> so<00:05:05.510> take<00:05:05.690> my

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
can do is turn the fabric so take my

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.320 
can do is turn the fabric so take my
ends<00:05:06.230> off<00:05:06.380> and<00:05:06.770> if<00:05:07.430> I<00:05:07.550> want<00:05:07.730> to<00:05:07.790> cut<00:05:07.970> this<00:05:08.120> into

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
ends off and if I want to cut this into

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.880 
ends off and if I want to cut this into
10<00:05:09.200> inch<00:05:10.000> blocks<00:05:11.000> we<00:05:11.840> can<00:05:11.960> go<00:05:12.110> ahead<00:05:12.230> now<00:05:12.380> you

10 inch blocks we can go ahead now you

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:14.560 
10 inch blocks we can go ahead now you
decide<00:05:13.250> how<00:05:13.460> much<00:05:13.490> you<00:05:13.730> want<00:05:13.910> to<00:05:14.090> layer<00:05:14.330> if

four layers go for it if you're don't
feel<00:05:19.280> like<00:05:19.460> you<00:05:19.580> do<00:05:20.120> as<00:05:20.360> accurate<00:05:21.020> cutting

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
feel like you do as accurate cutting

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.160 
feel like you do as accurate cutting
with<00:05:22.040> that<00:05:22.280> mini<00:05:22.520> just<00:05:22.910> simplify<00:05:23.630> it<00:05:23.660> of

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.170 
with that mini just simplify it of

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:25.750 
with that mini just simplify it of
course<00:05:24.350> it's<00:05:24.560> still<00:05:24.680> going<00:05:24.890> to<00:05:24.950> be<00:05:25.070> so<00:05:25.610> much

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760 
course it's still going to be so much

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.110 
course it's still going to be so much
quicker<00:05:26.120> when<00:05:26.690> you<00:05:26.810> actually<00:05:27.020> use<00:05:27.670> the<00:05:28.670> strip

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
quicker when you actually use the strip

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.730 
quicker when you actually use the strip
ology<00:05:29.510> rulers<00:05:29.900> so<00:05:30.110> what<00:05:30.290> I'm<00:05:30.380> going<00:05:30.470> to<00:05:30.530> do<00:05:30.650> is

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
ology rulers so what I'm going to do is

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.100 
ology rulers so what I'm going to do is
just<00:05:30.860> go<00:05:31.040> ahead<00:05:31.250> and<00:05:31.490> put<00:05:32.090> this<00:05:32.240> back<00:05:32.300> down<00:05:32.510> and

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
just go ahead and put this back down and

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.770 
just go ahead and put this back down and
then<00:05:33.530> go<00:05:33.740> ahead<00:05:33.919> and<00:05:34.070> cut<00:05:34.250> at<00:05:34.430> 0<00:05:34.940> that's<00:05:35.720> going

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
then go ahead and cut at 0 that's going

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.030 
then go ahead and cut at 0 that's going
to<00:05:35.930> cut<00:05:36.080> off<00:05:36.200> my<00:05:36.250> selvages<00:05:37.250> cut<00:05:37.850> at<00:05:37.970> 10<00:05:38.270> and

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.040 
to cut off my selvages cut at 10 and

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:45.550 
to cut off my selvages cut at 10 and
then<00:05:40.040> cut<00:05:40.310> it<00:05:40.340> 20<00:05:41.110> and<00:05:42.669> we<00:05:43.669> have<00:05:44.030> lots<00:05:44.960> of<00:05:45.200> 10

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
then cut it 20 and we have lots of 10

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.070 
then cut it 20 and we have lots of 10
inch<00:05:45.770> squares<00:05:46.220> now<00:05:46.970> if<00:05:47.210> we<00:05:47.330> wanted<00:05:47.660> to<00:05:47.840> we

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
inch squares now if we wanted to we

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.860 
inch squares now if we wanted to we
could<00:05:48.110> even<00:05:48.410> go<00:05:48.620> ahead<00:05:48.710> and<00:05:48.919> reposition<00:05:49.870> this

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 
could even go ahead and reposition this

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.900 
could even go ahead and reposition this
back<00:05:51.200> on<00:05:51.470> because<00:05:51.740> so<00:05:52.100> many<00:05:52.220> things<00:05:52.550> are<00:05:52.730> cut

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:52.910 
back on because so many things are cut

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.090 
back on because so many things are cut
out<00:05:53.030> of<00:05:53.180> layer<00:05:53.450> cakes<00:05:53.840> these<00:05:54.080> days<00:05:54.320> and<00:05:54.680> that's

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:55.100 
out of layer cakes these days and that's

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.710 
out of layer cakes these days and that's
a<00:05:55.220> 10<00:05:55.400> inch<00:05:55.550> square<00:05:55.820> so<00:05:56.060> if<00:05:56.150> I<00:05:56.240> wanted<00:05:56.450> to<00:05:56.510> cut

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 
a 10 inch square so if I wanted to cut

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.320 
a 10 inch square so if I wanted to cut
these<00:05:56.870> up<00:05:56.930> into<00:05:57.350> five<00:05:57.860> inch<00:05:57.890> squares<00:05:58.550> I<00:05:58.910> can

00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.330 
these up into five inch squares I can

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.170 
these up into five inch squares I can
just<00:05:59.480> come<00:05:59.660> back<00:05:59.840> and<00:06:00.160> cut<00:06:01.160> those<00:06:01.400> five<00:06:01.760> and

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
just come back and cut those five and

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.060 
just come back and cut those five and
then<00:06:02.330> turn<00:06:02.600> it<00:06:02.630> and<00:06:03.020> then<00:06:03.440> cut<00:06:03.650> them<00:06:03.740> five

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.070 
then turn it and then cut them five

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.310 
then turn it and then cut them five
again<00:06:04.490> so<00:06:04.730> it's<00:06:05.210> so<00:06:05.360> many<00:06:05.540> things<00:06:05.810> can<00:06:05.990> be<00:06:06.140> just

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:06.320 
again so it's so many things can be just

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.080 
again so it's so many things can be just
cut<00:06:06.530> down<00:06:06.560> to<00:06:06.980> what<00:06:07.130> you<00:06:07.250> need<00:06:07.430> them<00:06:07.580> to<00:06:07.730> be<00:06:07.880> and

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.090 
cut down to what you need them to be and

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.960 
cut down to what you need them to be and
you<00:06:08.540> will<00:06:08.690> have<00:06:08.960> perfect<00:06:09.620> accurate<00:06:10.550> squares

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:10.970 
you will have perfect accurate squares

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:15.010 
you will have perfect accurate squares
for<00:06:11.780> your<00:06:11.990> next<00:06:12.169> quilt<00:06:13.450> you'll<00:06:14.450> also<00:06:14.660> notice

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
for your next quilt you'll also notice

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.890 
for your next quilt you'll also notice
that<00:06:15.169> you<00:06:15.350> have<00:06:15.590> 45<00:06:15.980> degrees<00:06:16.580> and<00:06:16.730> 60<00:06:17.360> degree

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:17.900 
that you have 45 degrees and 60 degree

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.650 
that you have 45 degrees and 60 degree
lines<00:06:18.200> that<00:06:18.740> you<00:06:18.860> can<00:06:18.890> set<00:06:19.280> your<00:06:19.310> fabric<00:06:20.180> up<00:06:20.360> to

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:20.660 
lines that you can set your fabric up to

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.540 
lines that you can set your fabric up to
and<00:06:20.930> start<00:06:21.470> cutting<00:06:21.680> some<00:06:22.040> of<00:06:22.190> those<00:06:22.310> odd

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.550 
and start cutting some of those odd

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.540 
and start cutting some of those odd
shapes<00:06:23.090> such<00:06:23.600> as<00:06:23.630> diamonds<00:06:24.290> so<00:06:25.070> if<00:06:25.160> I<00:06:25.250> just<00:06:25.430> go

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:25.550 
shapes such as diamonds so if I just go

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.550 
shapes such as diamonds so if I just go
ahead<00:06:25.610> and<00:06:25.850> start<00:06:26.060> here<00:06:26.510> and<00:06:26.660> just<00:06:26.720> slide<00:06:27.380> on

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 
ahead and start here and just slide on

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.120 
ahead and start here and just slide on
through<00:06:28.180> then<00:06:29.180> you'll<00:06:29.450> find<00:06:29.840> you<00:06:30.560> will<00:06:30.770> have

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.130 
through then you'll find you will have

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:35.890 
through then you'll find you will have
new<00:06:32.290> shapes<00:06:33.310> very<00:06:34.310> easy<00:06:34.970> and<00:06:35.570> we<00:06:35.600> have

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900 
new shapes very easy and we have

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.620 
new shapes very easy and we have
diamonds<00:06:36.650> so<00:06:37.130> no<00:06:37.640> matter<00:06:37.820> what<00:06:38.240> your<00:06:38.390> pattern

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:38.630 
diamonds so no matter what your pattern

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.559 
diamonds so no matter what your pattern
asks<00:06:39.260> for<00:06:39.500> you'd<00:06:40.100> be<00:06:40.310> surprised<00:06:40.820> how<00:06:40.850> many
