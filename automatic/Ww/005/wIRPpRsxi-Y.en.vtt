00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.930
 couscous is the easiest thing in the world just 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.210
 we boil a cup and a half of 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.050
 water since it's boiling we're going to 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.380
 add a little salt 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:30.680

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.479
 and we put out the fire 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:47.360
 we cover it and let it go through 5 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:50.479

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.560
 to know right after the couscous has 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.480
 a quite neutral roast flavor 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.040
 simply easily with the aroma of 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.080
 the ingredients with which we are 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.930
 cooking 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.970

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.640
 rice or you can also prepare it well 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.800
 by myself many times here in the house 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.069
 I only prepare it by itself for those days 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.140
 I do not want to eat meat with rice 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.849
 a little more time I have nothing 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.160
 against rice but for those days 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:08.349
 that we walk very fast, because we can 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.440
 prepare a couscous and as you can see it 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:13.629
