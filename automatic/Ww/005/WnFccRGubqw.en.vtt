 Let me make it here for you to see. 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.859
 although the map is practically nothing 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.340
 so here we go to that 1 mil or design 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:40.050
 word put here 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.879
 photo had no angle but put on the 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.559
 creative is the advice that will be installed 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.899
 also in the arts and offline 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.360
 to get better from my tinkering it 's 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.760
 deactivated milk future 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.340

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:59.160
 For secches, I 'm more, you talk to me. 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:03.719
 coca in 1217 john o'shea who is here 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.220
 okay beauty you will create a new world 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.960
 convert to the world 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.390
 This is the first episode I'm going to teach. 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.479
 basic things will ever need a 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.840
 basic network knowledge tony network 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.780
 and bloch love that we have here in 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.759
 Fuck that sand, if I could. 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.950
 I can break the area and you can come here. 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.430
 take a block in case I 'm going to get it 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.290
 the block of land is back land has to 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.530
 be very fast left click has 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:37.259
 right today and beauty will start now 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:40.009
 to fall in the face 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.009
 so damn 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:48.620
 It was anyway, let me go back to 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.150
 that map that has already knocked over but already 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.360
 understood how it is done 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.920
 the bing net there right? 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.450
 good map of a bridge or but not for 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.800
 This will make me dependent because 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.380
 I still have to get some things from 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.390
 network and pick up make a capture system 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.300
 ready flag 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.070
 this is in the zero layer or layer or 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.780
 so there's no way you can put it 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.429
 edit below then things I advise 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.470
 you raise at least 20 blocks like this 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.440
 which start making the first square 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.480
 The thing that I'm going to do here is our lobby. 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.330
 Good, I'll teach you how to do it. 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.620
 a modern to send soap in CearÃ¡ 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.200
 no, I do not know 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.850
 our guys will be there leaving a 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.690
 comment what kind of tutorials of what 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:32.750
 games wants to learn how to do good already uses 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.340
 here then do at least the lobby 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.350
 will have to have your lobby at least 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.870
 all games - I will not practice for 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.940
 less will have a man for all 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.040
 games you will create for the kitchen 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.730
 standardized cute newt then 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:50.120
 This one is essential to your game, right? 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:53.000
 to be successful though here 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:58.400
 these stones that are firmness 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:01.580
 Here I am, I'm going to work on nothing. 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.880
 put here one area here because it has not 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.880
 as 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.989
 I think it's good, let's break it down. 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.040
 well and I defeated it, it was actually I think 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.260
 that does not have much to show now 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.440
 I will not feel you make a straight map 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.450
 map with nothing and I wanted you and 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.830
 that you comment on what kind of map 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.299
 that you want me to teach you to 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.620
 do what they really want me to do. 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:28.100
 I was going to make a mini game after 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.590
 they will try is and is adapting what to teach 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.120
 game of yours 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.400
 translating inspires to make a quiz 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.400
 a map of kuyt would be such questions 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.010
 things you will see and 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.560
 What do you do? 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.480
 teach you how to adapt and do your 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.060
 own map and DM is something like this 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.430
 theatricals good guys i want 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.330
 Your opinion to know what cut 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.050
 kind of tutorial by my god under the type 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.120
 tutorial 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:59.270
 You're the kind of map you want. 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.640
 good is that it is there and that one 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.800
 lose in the series I'm going to get that 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.570
 I do not think there's a lot of shows 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.940
 since there is no series d of 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.920
 that teaches you how to create mini 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.810
 games in a poll then it will be a 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.510
 very good opportunity 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.690
 because there are few people who do it 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:20.000
 make my god minecraft map with 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.430
 There are even more regions with 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.800
 names like the block you added and 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.290
 Beauty, I'm going to stop talking, this is it. 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.740
 of that range for you to help you 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:32.300
