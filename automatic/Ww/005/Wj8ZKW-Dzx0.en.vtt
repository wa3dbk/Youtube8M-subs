00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:06.060
 and how are you all friends of 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.910
 youtube or soul and bonet and today 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.550
 I bring you this new victory where 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.120
 I'm going to show you the corners of the 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:18.119
 original minions there is a way in the 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.240
 Minecraft game called minions 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.510
 but what I liked with this mode is 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.760
 that these minions the truth is that they are 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.080
 very ugly and then by reading the name 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.610
 we believed or some believed that 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.270
 they were going to be the original minions of the 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.680
 movie of my favorite villain 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:42.050
 and then I decided to change the styles 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.560
 to make them look better as in the 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.550
 series and that's what I bring them 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:52.800
 this is linear is that because the truth is 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.800
 best of those who requested it 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.650

 is that I have several writings that 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.510
 I threw myself 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:30.130
 and that 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.720
 after 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:37.069
 and now let's tell them how to put 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.930
 these 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:43.079
 the description of the video I will leave 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:46.560
 what it is for them to download the file 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:48.930
 of children and also no terms for 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.269
 that changes when they already have the mode 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.580
 of any version what they have to 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:56.230
 do 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:59.220
 obviously paste it into the mod folder 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.220
 potato 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.260
 to see apart 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.730
 the minecraft fruit folder 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.760
 woods and what they are going to do is open this 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.730
 minions mode 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.260
 if he is in touch instead of points and 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.260
 it can be a prepotent right click 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.560
 to open 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:32.060
 zip file to find out 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:35.110
 and textures 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:40.420
 robert and here is the skin of the minamb 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.420
 barnier this by default the one that has 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:49.220
 all they are going to do is look at 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.220
 this name note that it appears to them 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.930
 usually I have the 1.2 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.099
 and down 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.610
 this is the one that will copy the truth not 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.730
 I know if the new versions come 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:11.470
 the name changed but we continue very 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:14.660
 well in the file that I pass them 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:17.959
 they are going to change the name to how it is 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.609
 here they copied someone and the only thing 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.590
 have to do is drag it towards 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:25.630
 in 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:29.310
 they are going to drag me and they are going to let go 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.310
 and they have already changed 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:39.080
 and well, this would be all friends and 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.080
