00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
well I think the president's tone and

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.720 
well I think the president's tone and
tenor<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.809> delivery<00:00:58.410> were<00:00:58.680> outstanding<00:00:59.309> I

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.630 
I think Republicans no matter what they
say<00:01:18.810> which<00:01:19.200> they<00:01:19.380> could<00:01:19.439> give<00:01:19.890> it's<00:01:20.490> about

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
say which they could give it's about

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.990 
say which they could give it's about

America it it was really strong and I

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.990 
America it it was really strong and I

good<00:01:33.360> parts<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.049> head<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.829> State<00:01:35.040> of

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
good parts to the head to the State of

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.130 
good parts to the head to the State of
the<00:01:35.159> Union<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.640> thought<00:01:36.270> Georgia<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.900> speech

the Union I thought Georgia the speech
was<00:01:37.170> very<00:01:37.710> uplifting<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.579> if<00:01:39.380> he<00:01:40.380> was<00:01:40.619> in<00:01:40.890> many

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.940 
was very uplifting and if he was in many
ways<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:41.850> think<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.930> different<00:01:43.290> president<00:01:43.680> he

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950
