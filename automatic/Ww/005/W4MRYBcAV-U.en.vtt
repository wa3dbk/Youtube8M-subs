00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.070
 we believe in the bourgeoisie we believe in 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:15.110
 the bourgeoisie are going to radicalize the 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.110
 Enough already Revolution 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.650

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.939
 economic 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:29.550
 diego the village to the force sister to 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:33.500
 the ministers already here request 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.940
 they finished the smiles with the bourgeoisie 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.940
 I will say it more clearly 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.500
 I come willing 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.170
 radicalize the revolution against all 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.420
 those who sabotage it from the economic 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.019
 I do not care about the last name and the name 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.019
 that have 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.219
 and I ask the ministers hard hands 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.780
 stop 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.870
 which can not be removed 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.200
 the one who can not sustain his activity 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.580
 economic that the president leaves 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.170
 nicolÃ¡s maduro in statements yesterday 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.000
 he said that he will radicalize the 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.200
 revolution and that every person who does not 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.240
 can maintain its economic assets in the 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.680
 country must leave the country because you have 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.390
 that we have to leave if we are 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.250
 Venezuelans we have to live here in 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.540
 our land we need Venezuelans 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.820
 because I think it's a solution for the 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.540
 current problem of good that 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.980
 go from here friends in statements that 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.530
 gave yesterday nicholas president mature said 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.210
 that will radicalize the revolution and 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.320
 that any person who can not maintain 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.060
 your economic activity between the country 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.610
 must leave the country because he thinks 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.690
 respect good I think that's more 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:05.660
 violin if that aggressive message is a 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.060
 message that does not really help 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.130
 solve the country's problems a 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.040
 solution that can help the economy 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:18.410
 of the country what would be a solution could 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:21.530
 be call all sectors 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.710
 that produces so that there is a consensus and 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.330
 look for peace to buy the 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.860
 productivity 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.750
 you believe that the production problem in 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.160
 the good country can be noticed because as 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.620
 we see you are doing a colorist 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.700
 so basically good products 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.710
 for tuna that is not a problem of 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.270
 production and distribution in the country 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.800
 and attacking the entrepreneurs think it is 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.150
 the solution or telling them to leave 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.340
 absolutely 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.040
 but this one I repeat this create more 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.519
 violence and that's call 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.760
 to the confrontation to the class struggle 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:59.439
 that will not solve in any way 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.439
 the problems that we have now
