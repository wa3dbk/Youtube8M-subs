00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:05.479 

yes<00:01:01.340> the<00:01:02.340> Nano<00:01:02.520> flow<00:01:02.730> cell<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.920> flow<00:01:04.920> cell<00:01:05.250> as

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
yes the Nano flow cell is flow cell as

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.090 
yes the Nano flow cell is flow cell as
it<00:01:05.549> says<00:01:05.939> with<00:01:06.299> two<00:01:06.659> ionic<00:01:07.110> liquids<00:01:07.439> one

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
it says with two ionic liquids one

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.310 
it says with two ionic liquids one
positive<00:01:08.340> charge<00:01:08.549> one<00:01:09.180> negative<00:01:09.390> charge<00:01:09.600> yeah

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
positive charge one negative charge yeah

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.020 
positive charge one negative charge yeah
and<00:01:10.409> these<00:01:10.650> two<00:01:10.890> liquids<00:01:11.189> come<00:01:11.520> together<00:01:11.670> on<00:01:11.909> a

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
and these two liquids come together on a

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.630 
and these two liquids come together on a
member<00:01:12.390> on<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.650> great<00:01:13.860> thing<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.130> we<00:01:14.520> have

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
member on and the great thing is we have

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.149 
member on and the great thing is we have
a<00:01:14.909> great<00:01:15.360> power<00:01:15.659> we<00:01:16.170> have<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.320> great<00:01:16.560> drivetrain

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
a great power we have a great drivetrain

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.179 
a great power we have a great drivetrain
with<00:01:17.700> zero<00:01:17.970> emissions<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.650> mostly<00:01:20.100> the

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
with zero emissions so the mostly the

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.260 
with zero emissions so the mostly the
base<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.729> water<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:22.049> water<00:01:22.970> itself<00:01:23.970> has

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
base is water and the water itself has

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.300 
base is water and the water itself has
salt<00:01:24.869> elements<00:01:25.409> in<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.950> different

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
salt elements in it and different

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.819 
salt elements in it and different
elements<00:01:26.580> which<00:01:27.090> are<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.420> course<00:01:27.450> secret<00:01:28.170> and

elements which are of course secret and

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.569 
elements which are of course secret and
these<00:01:29.369> elements<00:01:29.880> are<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.869> importance

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
these elements are the importance

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:34.520 
these elements are the importance
invention<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.670> mr.<00:01:33.000> LaMacchia<00:01:33.270> who<00:01:34.259> has

invented<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.400> ionic<00:01:35.820> liquid<00:01:36.150> for<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.390> Nano

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
invented the ionic liquid for the Nano

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.319 
invented the ionic liquid for the Nano
flow<00:01:36.930> cell<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.770> with<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.520> we<00:01:38.790> have<00:01:38.820> we<00:01:39.299> are

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
flow cell and with that we have we are

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.450 
flow cell and with that we have we are
really<00:01:39.840> an<00:01:39.960> alternative<00:01:40.170> in<00:01:40.860> electro

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
really an alternative in electro

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.300 
really an alternative in electro

example<00:01:51.020> if<00:01:52.020> we're<00:01:52.229> talking<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.159> that

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
example if we're talking to you is that

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.670 
example if we're talking to you is that
what<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.119> do<00:01:54.299> is<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:55.110> do<00:01:55.259> instead<00:01:55.530> of

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
what you do is is that you do instead of

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.310 
what you do is is that you do instead of
charging<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.310> car<00:01:56.579> with<00:01:56.790> electrically<00:01:57.479> you

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
charging the car with electrically you

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.609 
charging the car with electrically you
go<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.619> us<00:01:59.329> gas<00:02:00.329> station<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.079> change<00:02:01.530> the

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
go to us gas station and you change the

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.249 
go to us gas station and you change the
water<00:02:02.009> we<00:02:03.000> don't<00:02:03.270> change<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:03.930> it's<00:02:04.140> not

reversible

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.609 
reversible
no<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:06.090> directly<00:02:06.600> fill<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:06.960> in<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.469> will

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
no you directly fill it in and it will

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.680 
no you directly fill it in and it will
be<00:02:07.799> used<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.369> then<00:02:08.670> it's<00:02:08.849> it's<00:02:09.239> energy

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
be used and then it's it's energy

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.839 
be used and then it's it's energy
dissipates<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.709> dissipates<00:02:11.190> yeah<00:02:11.580> it's<00:02:11.760> a

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
dissipates it dissipates yeah it's a

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.160 
dissipates it dissipates yeah it's a
kind<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.180> water<00:02:12.390> steam<00:02:12.750> which<00:02:12.930> come

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
kind of water steam which come

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.150 
kind of water steam which come
yeah<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.160> this<00:02:14.940> is<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.930> think<00:02:16.319> one<00:02:16.950> of<00:02:16.980> the

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
yeah and this is the I think one of the

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.979 
yeah and this is the I think one of the
most<00:02:17.340> regular<00:02:18.090> or<00:02:18.239> the<00:02:18.330> best<00:02:18.480> ways<00:02:18.720> for

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
most regular or the best ways for

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.470 
most regular or the best ways for
filling<00:02:19.890> up<00:02:20.010> because<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:20.819> have<00:02:20.940> not<00:02:21.120> a<00:02:21.150> long

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
filling up because you have not a long

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.140 
filling up because you have not a long
time<00:02:21.780> for<00:02:22.110> charging<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:22.709> it's<00:02:22.980> actually<00:02:23.150> the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
time for charging so it's actually the

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.360 
time for charging so it's actually the
charging<00:02:24.690> time<00:02:24.810> only<00:02:25.110> takes<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.560> time<00:02:25.800> of<00:02:26.099> a

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
charging time only takes the time of a

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:36.830 
charging time only takes the time of a
normal<00:02:26.670> fueling<00:02:35.120> thing<00:02:36.120> is<00:02:36.270> of<00:02:36.480> course<00:02:36.510> we

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
normal fueling thing is of course we

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.800 
normal fueling thing is of course we
used<00:02:37.080> more<00:02:37.470> liquid<00:02:38.130> we<00:02:38.340> have<00:02:38.370> a<00:02:38.489> tank<00:02:39.090> of<00:02:39.239> 500

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
used more liquid we have a tank of 500

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.559 
used more liquid we have a tank of 500
liters<00:02:40.110> two<00:02:40.560> times<00:02:40.860> 250<00:02:41.850> and<00:02:43.099> 250<00:02:44.569> positive

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
liters two times 250 and 250 positive

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.000 
liters two times 250 and 250 positive
charge<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:45.989> negative<00:02:46.080> charge<00:02:46.319> so<00:02:46.680> we're<00:02:46.800> 500

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
charge and negative charge so we're 500

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.550 
charge and negative charge so we're 500
liters<00:02:47.550> this<00:02:47.700> lot

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
liters this lot

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.590 
liters this lot
but<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.920> weight<00:02:50.100> we<00:02:50.790> have<00:02:50.880> less<00:02:51.120> weight<00:02:51.360> in

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
but the weight we have less weight in

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.710 
but the weight we have less weight in
the<00:02:51.690> engine<00:02:52.049> so<00:02:52.350> and<00:02:52.860> that's<00:02:53.250> this<00:02:53.640> is<00:02:53.700> a<00:02:53.819> kind

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
the engine so and that's this is a kind

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.500 
the engine so and that's this is a kind
of<00:02:54.900> good<00:02:55.560> solution<00:02:56.040> then<00:02:56.190> now<00:02:56.610> two<00:02:57.180> final

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
of good solution then now two final

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.240 
of good solution then now two final
questions<00:02:57.600> what's<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.290> range<00:02:58.500> if<00:02:58.920> you<00:02:59.040> fill

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
questions what's the range if you fill

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.550 
questions what's the range if you fill
up<00:02:59.489> with<00:02:59.760> four<00:02:59.970> what<00:03:00.269> is<00:03:00.299> the<00:03:00.450> range<00:03:01.260> of<00:03:01.440> the

solution<00:03:29.519> it's<00:03:29.850> not<00:03:29.880> really<00:03:30.269> far<00:03:30.600> away

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
solution it's not really far away

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.550 
solution it's not really far away
because<00:03:31.290> this<00:03:31.739> is<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.910> exterior<00:03:33.299> is

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
because this is the exterior is

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.170 
because this is the exterior is
homologated<00:03:34.560> nearly<00:03:35.220> 100%<00:03:35.700> and<00:03:36.120> the

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
homologated nearly 100% and the

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.300 
homologated nearly 100% and the
interiors<00:03:36.630> 90<00:03:37.170> percent<00:03:37.500> so<00:03:37.890> we<00:03:38.040> are<00:03:38.160> very

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
interiors 90 percent so we are very

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.580 
interiors 90 percent so we are very
close<00:03:38.609> to<00:03:38.850> get<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:39.900> serious<00:03:40.290> production

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
close to get the serious production

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.310 
close to get the serious production
homologation<00:03:41.190> so<00:03:41.880> this<00:03:42.329> car<00:03:42.540> is<00:03:42.570> not<00:03:42.870> far<00:03:43.079> away

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
homologation so this car is not far away

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.380 
homologation so this car is not far away
to<00:03:43.380> get<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:43.829> get<00:03:44.070> in<00:03:44.220> production<00:03:44.790> so<00:03:45.000> we<00:03:45.030> hope

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
to get and get in production so we hope

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.810 
to get and get in production so we hope
to<00:03:45.540> see<00:03:45.720> that<00:03:46.350> you<00:03:46.440> can<00:03:46.590> buy<00:03:46.709> it<00:03:46.769> soon<00:03:47.040> ok
