00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.620
 we have already had a lot to do 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.000
 taste to taste is from the bmw 6 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.860
 series 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.180
 some time ago reason for the 320 hp 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.360
 strong 640 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:31.029
 convertible we also have a 640 u drinks 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.730
 periodic then was up to about three 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.500
 dog 8hp I believe then you have at the top 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.470
 the m6 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.440
 absurd thing really bizarre fast a lot 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.770
 sensation and spectacle and what falls there 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.660
 then in between is meat or fish 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.230
 a happy medium 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.230
 we will find out today 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.219
 to begin with the power that comes out 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:04.449
 a v8 with two singles krol turbos 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:05.860
 450 hp and click 650 minutes meters 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.780
 therefore you go from zero to one hundred 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.880
 and four point 6 seconds and the top sider 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.860
 for sure you finish a lot of 15 km 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.750
 per hour 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.930
 but in terms of power, it is very tasty 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.000
 in between 640 and m6 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.670
 the block in front here it is and 63 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.820
 block is basically the same block as 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.920
 that in the m6 there is something s63 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.899
 and to ensure that power M6 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.750
 they have a different exhaust manifold 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:33.160
 mounted the turbo pressure is higher and the 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.020
 turbos are eye of doth be a member 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.050
 single scrolls euros and it looks 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.820
 forest carrier who made adjustments for that 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.909
 the m6 they have made especially 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.159
 peak power to impose higher 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.799
 the torque on the shield is only 30 mm 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.289
 686 newton meters but peak power 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.240
 shield 110 hp 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:55.020
 and especially if you use the grass in this car 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.780
 a bit of kicking in then you feel that couple 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.810
 then you feel that difference with the m6 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.770
 is not that big at all 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.210
 but with the m6 I can of course do it 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.460
 no comparison can be complete 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.070
 other car but also the difference with 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.740
 the m sports suspension is very large in it 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.540
 still feel really what did you conduct 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.250
 what the suspension did what you cell 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.750
 did your rear wheels 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.640
 you were a little more in contact with the 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:24.120
 car and the distance between you and the car 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.760
 is slightly larger in this also in terms of sound 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.280
 I fall exactly between 640 and m6 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.650
 you do have that v8 sound what a 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.140
 little muffled is especially in here 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.430
 outside key and very tasty 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.620
 in this outlet so it too 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.210
 butterfly valves on both sides on the 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.730
 inner pipe is a valve that goes 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.740
 open tree pole speed and then comes 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.750
 very nice sound from it is real 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.890
 a bit ominous 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:52.370
 a bit dark and it fits very well 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.370
 this car 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.319
 Hey 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.360
 this copy is also delicious 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.890
 dressed with brown metallic paint this 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.810
 coat presentable 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.970
 well it looks really fantastic 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.630
 certainly in combination with these rims 20 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.240
 inch 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:16.420
 and at first I didn't find them 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.620
 so beautiful it's a bit weird that black 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.880
 with that aluminum 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.200
 but how long you look at that how 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.950
 they actually better on the car van 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.950
 jokes 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.520
 he also has some black ones 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.000
 accents around black exhaust pipes 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.110
 black whole yes it makes him whole 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.850
 stylish yet reasonable 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.650
 impressive 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.990
 the 650 is here but paris actually 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.050
 much close to the 46 whom he 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:43.600
 costs 118,000 euros and the m6 is still 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.970
 tens of thousands of euros far away 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.980
 in terms of power, however, it comes a lot 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.170
 closer to the m6 performance 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.670
 are also closer to the m6 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.430
 on paper it may seem like you 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:57.490
 makes concessions when in 650 kiko 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.080
 it looks like a little meat or fish though 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.330
 in practice it appears that it is a whole 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.060
 fine gathering is of all sorts 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.310
 components from the 6 series corpulent 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.370
 value 6 series is so good at cruising 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.980
 but also really the performance part 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.590
 the 650 that actually scores on all 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:18.790
 points you can come up with a big 8 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:21.870
 and that makes him an optimal onro 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.870
 inside the 6 series
