00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210 
not as a live stream but it's just going

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:34.940 
not as a live stream but it's just going
to<00:06:33.300> be<00:06:33.420> as<00:06:33.600> like<00:06:33.750> a<00:06:33.780> series<00:06:34.230> where<00:06:34.410> I<00:06:34.650> edit

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:38.970 
I think to do it at the moment like this

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.010
