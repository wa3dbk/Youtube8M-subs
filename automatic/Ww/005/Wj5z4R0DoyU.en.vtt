we've ever built in the history of

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.170 
we've ever built in the history of
Lamborghini<00:03:06.150> so<00:03:07.019> in<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.230> 50<00:03:07.739> years<00:03:07.769> in<00:03:08.370> total

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
Lamborghini so in the 50 years in total

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
Lamborghini so in the 50 years in total
they<00:03:09.329> were<00:03:09.510> built<00:03:09.870> approximately<00:03:12.200> 30,000

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
they were built approximately 30,000

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.170 
they were built approximately 30,000
cars<00:03:13.440> so<00:03:13.829> from<00:03:14.040> all<00:03:14.250> models<00:03:14.790> we<00:03:14.940> have<00:03:14.970> ever

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
cars so from all models we have ever

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.970 
cars so from all models we have ever
done<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:16.200> sum<00:03:16.500> is<00:03:16.970> 30,000<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:18.320> almost<00:03:19.400> 50%<00:03:20.400> is

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
done the sum is 30,000 and almost 50% is

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.229 
done the sum is 30,000 and almost 50% is
Gallardo<00:03:22.980> so

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
Gallardo so

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.830 
Gallardo so
approximately<00:03:25.200> circa<00:03:26.329> 14,000<00:03:27.329> cards<00:03:27.659> so<00:03:27.780> you

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
approximately circa 14,000 cards so you

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.429 
approximately circa 14,000 cards so you
can<00:03:28.079> imagine<00:03:28.379> how<00:03:29.219> important<00:03:30.090> for<00:03:30.930> us

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:31.439 
can imagine how important for us
