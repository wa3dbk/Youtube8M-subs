00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
tangled it just felt just not nice on

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.649 
tangled it just felt just not nice on
the<00:01:45.090> back<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.329> my<00:01:45.420> neck

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
the back of my neck

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.310 
the back of my neck
so<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.380> also<00:01:46.590> tangles<00:01:47.430> when<00:01:47.700> it's<00:01:48.119> dry<00:01:49.040> and<00:01:50.180> all

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
so it also tangles when it's dry and all

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.020 
so it also tangles when it's dry and all
when<00:01:52.320> there's<00:01:52.500> too<00:01:52.740> much<00:01:52.770> product<00:01:53.520> product

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
when there's too much product product

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.319 
when there's too much product product
buildup<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.630> hair<00:01:54.840> okay<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:55.649> um<00:01:56.329> the

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
buildup in the hair okay so um the

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.999 
buildup in the hair okay so um the
dryness<00:01:57.810> can<00:01:57.990> come<00:01:58.229> from<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.560> when<00:01:58.649> I<00:01:58.680> heat

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
dryness can come from that when I heat

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.679 
dryness can come from that when I heat
styling<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.579> like<00:01:59.759> when<00:01:59.880> I<00:01:59.909> straighten<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.570> to
