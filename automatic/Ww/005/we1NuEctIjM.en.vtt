00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.530
 three minutes 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.269
 a council and an expert is today 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.679
 the expert is françois habert founder 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.299
 and directing del valle tightening 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.770
 hello françois today its end 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.039
 so today you will talk to us 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.230
 françois of one of a thematic this 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.400
 old question is this old conflict 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:29.220
 of ine versus lahti yes quite 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.689
 which I call elsewhere can we 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.130
 turn a camel into a horse 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.690
 race 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.850
 this old question is some 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.410
 thing that I could elaborate on the turn of 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.700
 several experiences and maybe it's 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.920
 the opportunity also to locate you a 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.489
 little my course i have a pretty 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.800
 atypical 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.379
 at first I was an officer at the Legion 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.719
 foreigner for five years in 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.170
 very operational units with a 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.460
 dimension site important training 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.800
 and then I did four years 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.899
 in finance gets lost in the world 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.969
 cruel in the financial war 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.680
 and then I came back to my first 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.750
 loves ie the human and that's the 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.720
 wire director of what I could 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.220
 build after in front of particular 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.470
 oriented a lot of people who were looking for a 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.750
 work in each of these experiments 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.400
 there I was brought suddenly to think in 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.590
 depth on the way both 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.229
 to activate people as a leader is 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.759
 to help them take the 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.740
 good direction and to give the best 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.400
 of themselves is for me the key point 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.380
 of leadership 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.390
 what was my finding and it's a 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.850
 finding that I had to really affirm 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.350
 with strength today is that even 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.180
 if there is today a whole series of 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.500
 formations we can not replace 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.159
 fundamentally the way in which the 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.770
 people act 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.719
 we hear we see a lot of books 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.340
 who can today proclaimed you 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:43.600
 are all entrepreneurs you are 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.990
 all sellers etc 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.530
 it is an illusion we can of course 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.329
 take 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.799
 there are many possibilities 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:53.380
 today can take some 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.569
 number of techniques to get by it 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.640
 Nevertheless, this technique does not 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:00.880
 will not replace the way of being 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.679
 basically to things and what 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.560
 can bring a number of people to 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:07.840
 be wrong in the long run if who go 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.310
 to believe that these formations are going to 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.120
 shoot them their situation 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.250
 while in fact following the 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.569
 teachings of such training and 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.680
 will find in a posture of 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.390
 behaviors they will make 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.340
 unhappy as long as they will not be 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.450
 sustainable and they will meet again 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.209
 potentially in a posture if this 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.230
 is no less discomfort checks 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.750
 and so suddenly can we 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.790
 turn a horse into a camel 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.950
 forgive a racehorse for me no 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.200
 you can eventually take a 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.720
 plowing horse and get him to have 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.889
 a bit too a bit more haughty but 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:48.310
 you succeed in having the steady stream of 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:48.819
 horse the camel will never be the 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.799
 Good choice 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:57.130
 so that's it if you want and often 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:03:00.850
 the opposition of those who consider that 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:03.910
 we can become what I choose 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.739
 tend to believe that one becomes 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.810
 what we are basically and that it 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:12.160
 is for his to discover in 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.959
 depth the engines that drives us and 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.329
 on the other hand and it might be without 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:19.480
 doubt the second message of these few 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.709
 a few moments shared with you from 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.630
 think in a team 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.489
 that is what is it that is 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.120
 wonderful when working in 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.069
 now 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.750
 and when we can just share a 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.790
 entrepreneurial adventure 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.799
 is that there are talents 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.040
 complementary there are ways 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:38.750
 to act which are precisely done for 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.680
 to articulate with each other 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.219
 so here are the good starting points for me 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.500
 apparently it 

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:48.530
 as we speak of companies 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.560
 it is a knowledge to know oneself and suddenly 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.209
 his voice what are the logics that 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.150
 make us performant legitimate and 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.069
 sustainable and on the other hand know which 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.739
 are the complements that we need to 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.970
 way to make teams operational 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.500
 well thank you very much francois baer
