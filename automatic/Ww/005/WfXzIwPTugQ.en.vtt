 candlelight by the grandparents 

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:21.649
 but it was necessary to resituate itself at the arrival of the man of electricity 

00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:26.069
 my great-grandfather to hull a good recipe of the few in the 

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:28.099
 tradition and innovation that went from there 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.169
 you have to start in the morning very early 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.989
 light the fire on the field too much and then for several hours of 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.690
 kneaders turn the part then we make our apartment with southern accents 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.550
 mass to a certain degree by doing what the mixture m it takes that 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.010
 this is a perfect modest rise between the two the two parts for 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.240
 finish we add a fine for our raw material 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.240
 after his double function as m 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.650
 stÃ©phane da maybe because the stabbing 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.920
 if this system existed in Provence 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.500
 but it's an opportunity to work 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.340
 for the Christmas holidays it is also what is not always 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.650
 been done since we only work from October to December 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.820
 always on behalf of all heard of full range of equipment coming from 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.150
 from school 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.550
 m around the table maybe we could personal from the family who 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.170
 works as some 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.110
 so if you want it was a little the beautiful blonde to continue this 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.240
 tradition 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.500
 my grandfather me 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.770
 she took over 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:28.780
 from his father 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.480
 my father took over 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.870
 after a few months i arrived in fifth generation washington 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.470
 post on what I do a little sweat it's a tradition in the Senate 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.240
 it's fashionable 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.940
 these are gestures that save 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.940
 according to a study of monetary union 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.410
 we do not have a recipe for which we maintain since the origins 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.650
 but if all this requires a lot of rigor and work as 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.729

 the future is possible 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.389
 aware that I still need to be improved 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:51.609

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:52.679
