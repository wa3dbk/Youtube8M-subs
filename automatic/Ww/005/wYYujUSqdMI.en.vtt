so this here is another one of our
microgames<00:03:53.819> the<00:03:54.659> hot<00:03:54.840> wire<00:03:54.989> so<00:03:55.860> what<00:03:55.980> you're

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
microgames the hot wire so what you're

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:57.589 
microgames the hot wire so what you're
doing<00:03:56.129> is<00:03:56.430> with<00:03:56.670> the<00:03:56.760> two<00:03:56.879> analog<00:03:57.239> sticks<00:03:57.269> who

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
doing is with the two analog sticks who

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.539 
doing is with the two analog sticks who
control<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:58.019> control<00:03:58.650> caps<00:03:58.829> hands<00:03:59.069> and<00:03:59.340> you

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
control the control caps hands and you

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:00.649 
control the control caps hands and you
want<00:03:59.700> to<00:03:59.790> get<00:03:59.879> the<00:03:59.939> wire<00:04:00.090> is<00:04:00.239> close<00:04:00.480> enough

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659 
want to get the wire is close enough

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:04.850 
want to get the wire is close enough
together<00:04:00.870> to<00:04:01.079> create<00:04:01.379> it<00:04:01.620> are<00:04:03.470> but<00:04:04.470> if<00:04:04.590> you<00:04:04.709> go

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
together to create it are but if you go

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.520 
together to create it are but if you go
to<00:04:05.099> close<00:04:05.370> with<00:04:06.060> a<00:04:06.150> spark<00:04:06.420> out<00:04:06.540> like<00:04:06.720> that<00:04:06.840> you

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
to close with a spark out like that you

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.020 
to close with a spark out like that you
don't<00:04:07.560> want<00:04:07.829> that<00:04:07.950> to<00:04:08.069> happen<00:04:08.099> three<00:04:08.519> times<00:04:08.549> or

don't want that to happen three times or

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.380 
don't want that to happen three times or
else<00:04:09.239> caps<00:04:09.450> going<00:04:09.659> to<00:04:09.720> get<00:04:09.840> a<00:04:10.019> lot<00:04:10.049> of<00:04:10.290> damage

else caps going to get a lot of damage
careful<00:04:12.390> there<00:04:12.510> there<00:04:12.840> we<00:04:12.930> go<00:04:13.049> ok<00:04:13.859> so<00:04:13.920> we

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
careful there there we go ok so we

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.550 
careful there there we go ok so we
successfully<00:04:14.640> sabotage<00:04:15.090> this<00:04:15.390> this<00:04:16.079> unit<00:04:16.380> and

alright so another thing that comes in

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.270 
alright so another thing that comes in
handy<00:05:56.750> with<00:05:57.020> the<00:05:57.140> tactical<00:05:57.680> vision<00:05:57.890> it<00:05:58.010> lets

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.280 
handy with the tactical vision it lets

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.860 
handy with the tactical vision it lets
you<00:05:58.430> know<00:05:58.580> where<00:05:58.880> although<00:05:59.240> the<00:05:59.360> platforming

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
you know where although the platforming

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.990 
you know where although the platforming
objects<00:06:00.170> are<00:06:00.320> in<00:06:00.470> the<00:06:00.560> world<00:06:00.710> as<00:06:00.920> well<00:06:01.070> so<00:06:01.850> it

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
objects are in the world as well so it

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.610 
objects are in the world as well so it
allows<00:06:02.210> you<00:06:02.360> to<00:06:02.450> know<00:06:02.600> how<00:06:03.200> you<00:06:03.260> can<00:06:03.440> pass

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
allows you to know how you can pass

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.860 
allows you to know how you can pass
through<00:06:03.920> the<00:06:04.070> world<00:06:04.300> it<00:06:05.300> also<00:06:05.450> lights<00:06:05.780> up

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.870 
through the world it also lights up

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.300 
through the world it also lights up
targets<00:06:06.290> that<00:06:06.410> you<00:06:06.530> might<00:06:06.680> need<00:06:06.830> in<00:06:07.070> order<00:06:07.160> to

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
targets that you might need in order to

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.750 
targets that you might need in order to
progress<00:06:07.570> but<00:06:08.570> this<00:06:09.340> drops<00:06:10.340> down<00:06:10.460> the<00:06:10.580> ladder

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:10.760 
progress but this drops down the ladder

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.350 
progress but this drops down the ladder
