00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.300 
been made out of red Jersey not quite
short<00:01:36.479> but<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.110> kind<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.409> had<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.680> even<00:01:38.130> though

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
short but it kind of had it even though

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.749 
short but it kind of had it even though
it<00:01:38.430> had<00:01:38.550> a<00:01:38.580> high<00:01:38.790> neckline<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.690> did<00:01:40.110> have<00:01:40.380> this

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
it had a high neckline it did have this

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.120 
it had a high neckline it did have this
sheer<00:01:41.759> side<00:01:42.330> panel<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.440> I'm<00:01:43.530> not<00:01:43.680> sure<00:01:43.920> that's

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
sheer side panel so I'm not sure that's

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.920 
sheer side panel so I'm not sure that's
actually<00:01:44.369> nude<00:01:44.790> or<00:01:44.970> really<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.360> sheer<00:01:45.659> but<00:01:45.840> it

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
actually nude or really is sheer but it

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.200 
actually nude or really is sheer but it
was<00:01:46.020> pretty<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:47.040> also<00:01:47.220> had<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.700> lace

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
was pretty and it also had this lace

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.050 
was pretty and it also had this lace
applique<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.229> connected<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:50.130> sheer<00:01:50.550> panel

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
applique that connected the sheer panel

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.840 
applique that connected the sheer panel
to<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:52.770> jersey<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.430> made<00:01:53.580> a<00:01:53.610> nice

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
to the jersey so it made a nice

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.520

that the organization chose was a little

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.570 
that the organization chose was a little
bit<00:05:55.260> darker<00:05:55.710> it<00:05:55.800> wasn't<00:05:56.100> such<00:05:56.310> of<00:05:56.520> a

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
bit darker it wasn't such of a

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.720 
bit darker it wasn't such of a
fire-engine<00:05:57.060> red<00:05:57.900> tone<00:05:58.560> and<00:05:58.920> that's<00:05:59.340> great

00:05:59.720 --> 00:05:59.730 
fire-engine red tone and that's great

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.040 
fire-engine red tone and that's great
because<00:05:59.940> right<00:06:00.330> now<00:06:00.480> we're<00:06:00.690> seeing<00:06:00.900> in

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
because right now we're seeing in

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.990 
because right now we're seeing in
fashion<00:06:01.470> this<00:06:01.590> trend<00:06:01.950> towards<00:06:02.310> like<00:06:02.460> oxblood

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
fashion this trend towards like oxblood

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.170 
fashion this trend towards like oxblood
or<00:06:03.420> more<00:06:04.320> of<00:06:04.410> these<00:06:04.530> like<00:06:04.680> maroon<00:06:05.040> tones<00:06:05.520> and

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180

so<00:06:07.470> I<00:06:07.680> like<00:06:08.070> that<00:06:08.280> she<00:06:08.610> was<00:06:08.700> a<00:06:08.760> little<00:06:08.970> bit

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
so I like that she was a little bit

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:10.940 
so I like that she was a little bit
trendy<00:06:09.540> with<00:06:09.660> the<00:06:09.750> dress<00:06:10.020> it<00:06:10.320> was<00:06:10.710> different

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:10.950 
trendy with the dress it was different

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.920 
trendy with the dress it was different
because<00:06:11.250> it's<00:06:11.640> velvet<00:06:12.120> I<00:06:12.240> acting<00:06:12.720> that<00:06:12.810> the

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
because it's velvet I acting that the

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.960 
because it's velvet I acting that the
beading<00:06:13.260> was<00:06:13.290> great<00:06:13.710> not<00:06:14.010> over-the-top<00:06:14.370> and

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:14.970 
beading was great not over-the-top and

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.810 
beading was great not over-the-top and

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:31.190 
States I think it's a little tricky that

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.399 
States I think it's a little tricky that
she's<00:07:31.430> wearing<00:07:31.880> this<00:07:32.030> pink<00:07:32.569> color<00:07:32.840> dress<00:07:33.199> no

00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:33.409 
she's wearing this pink color dress no

00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:35.050 
she's wearing this pink color dress no

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:35.060 
matter how amazing she looks in it in

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.730 
matter how amazing she looks in it in
the<00:07:35.150> u.s.<00:07:35.449> like<00:07:35.659> we<00:07:36.050> don't<00:07:36.139> really<00:07:36.319> go<00:07:36.530> for

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:36.740 
the u.s. like we don't really go for

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.709 
the u.s. like we don't really go for
those<00:07:36.860> colors<00:07:37.219> we<00:07:37.370> really<00:07:37.940> crown<00:07:38.240> in<00:07:38.479> jewel

00:07:38.709 --> 00:07:38.719 
those colors we really crown in jewel

00:07:38.719 --> 00:07:40.839 
those colors we really crown in jewel
tones<00:07:38.770> so<00:07:39.770> that's<00:07:39.949> the<00:07:40.069> only<00:07:40.219> risk<00:07:40.610> with<00:07:40.819> that

00:07:40.839 --> 00:07:40.849 
tones so that's the only risk with that

00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:44.649 
tones so that's the only risk with that
