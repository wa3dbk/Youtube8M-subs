to<00:01:42.090> eat<00:01:42.240> 5<00:01:42.689> glass<00:01:42.960> gold<00:01:43.770> ingot<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.220> two<00:01:44.820> oak

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
to eat 5 glass gold ingot and two oak

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.649 
to eat 5 glass gold ingot and two oak
wood<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.479> also<00:01:46.350> guys<00:01:46.500> if<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:47.070> used<00:01:47.659> the

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
wood and also guys if you used the

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.530 
wood and also guys if you used the
regular<00:01:48.899> snowflake<00:01:49.470> in<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:50.040> same<00:01:50.189> pattern

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
regular snowflake in the same pattern

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.609 
regular snowflake in the same pattern
recipe<00:01:51.540> pattern<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:52.110> will<00:01:52.200> make<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.380> snow

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
recipe pattern you will make a snow

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.710 
recipe pattern you will make a snow
globe<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.070> if<00:01:53.759> we<00:01:53.880> test<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.149> snow<00:01:54.299> globe<00:01:54.509> out

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
globe and if we test the snow globe out

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.950 
globe and if we test the snow globe out
you'll<00:01:55.649> see<00:01:56.119> that<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.270> has<00:01:57.360> some<00:01:57.390> particle

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
you'll see that it has some particle

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.929 
you'll see that it has some particle
effects<00:01:58.229> it's<00:01:58.380> really<00:01:58.710> cool<00:01:58.920> it's<00:01:59.430> got<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.610> tree

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
effects it's really cool it's got a tree

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.340 
effects it's really cool it's got a tree
and<00:02:00.240> it's<00:02:00.659> up<00:02:00.750> some<00:02:00.899> plants

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
and it's up some plants

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.539 
and it's up some plants
I<00:02:01.380> mean<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.829> think<00:02:01.950> that's<00:02:02.130> one<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.430> best

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
I mean I think that's one of the best

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.609 
I mean I think that's one of the best
features<00:02:02.909> in<00:02:03.060> this<00:02:03.149> as<00:02:03.299> well<00:02:03.990> as<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.229> creepers

portal 1
when<00:02:14.580> you<00:02:14.670> craft<00:02:14.940> that<00:02:15.180> in<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.540> regular<00:02:15.840> world

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
when you craft that in the regular world

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.630 
when you craft that in the regular world
you'll<00:02:16.470> start<00:02:16.680> getting<00:02:16.740> sucked<00:02:17.099> in<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.520> it

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
dimension if you do it in this dimension

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.059 
dimension if you do it in this dimension
it<00:02:21.810> will<00:02:22.020> just<00:02:22.110> take<00:02:22.230> you<00:02:22.349> back<00:02:22.380> as<00:02:22.709> well<00:02:22.890> so

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
break this block so we don't actually

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.840 
break this block so we don't actually
teleport<00:02:40.440> there<00:02:40.620> what<00:02:41.400> I<00:02:41.430> have<00:02:41.610> in<00:02:41.700> here

nothing but um there's also another cool
feature<00:02:45.019> the<00:02:46.819> candy<00:02:47.819> logs<00:02:48.000> now<00:02:48.300> this<00:02:48.420> is

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
feature the candy logs now this is

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.440 
feature the candy logs now this is
another<00:02:48.750> tree<00:02:48.989> that<00:02:49.019> spawns<00:02:49.350> in<00:02:49.500> spy<00:02:49.769> ohm<00:02:49.920> and

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
another tree that spawns in spy ohm and

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.509 
another tree that spawns in spy ohm and
you<00:02:51.450> can<00:02:51.600> craft<00:02:51.810> I<00:02:52.200> think<00:02:52.739> you<00:02:52.799> need<00:02:52.950> four<00:02:53.250> and

is<00:03:21.380> stackable<00:03:22.380> snow<00:03:22.650> now<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.400> largest<00:03:23.760> stack

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
is stackable snow now the largest stack

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.199 
is stackable snow now the largest stack
of<00:03:24.239> snow<00:03:24.390> is<00:03:24.600> two<00:03:24.810> so<00:03:25.170> if<00:03:25.350> you<00:03:25.500> break<00:03:25.799> that

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
of snow is two so if you break that

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.330 
of snow is two so if you break that
stone<00:03:27.209> will<00:03:27.299> just<00:03:27.480> pile<00:03:27.780> back<00:03:27.930> up<00:03:28.140> and<00:03:28.410> we<00:03:29.070> have

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
stone will just pile back up and we have

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.150 
stone will just pile back up and we have
the<00:03:30.060> smallest<00:03:31.019> one<00:03:31.260> which<00:03:31.440> is<00:03:31.530> a<00:03:31.560> normal<00:03:31.980> snow

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
the smallest one which is a normal snow

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.789 
the smallest one which is a normal snow
so<00:03:32.910> it's<00:03:33.030> pretty<00:03:33.150> cool<00:03:33.420> I<00:03:33.720> mean<00:03:33.959> I<00:03:34.200> thought

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
so it's pretty cool I mean I thought

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.229 
so it's pretty cool I mean I thought
it'd<00:03:34.950> be<00:03:34.980> cool<00:03:35.190> if<00:03:35.340> it<00:03:35.459> just<00:03:35.579> keeps<00:03:35.880> going<00:03:36.030> up

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
it'd be cool if it just keeps going up

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.300 
it'd be cool if it just keeps going up
and<00:03:36.359> up<00:03:36.480> enough<00:03:36.750> but<00:03:36.989> I<00:03:37.650> think<00:03:37.739> you<00:03:38.070> would<00:03:38.160> lose

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
and up enough but I think you would lose

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.190 
and up enough but I think you would lose
your<00:03:38.430> house<00:03:38.579> doing<00:03:38.850> that<00:03:38.970> and<00:03:39.720> it<00:03:39.989> would<00:03:40.079> take

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
your house doing that and it would take

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.229 
your house doing that and it would take
up<00:03:40.290> a<00:03:40.350> lot<00:03:40.470> of<00:03:40.500> memory<00:03:40.799> jeez<00:03:41.130> okay<00:03:41.910> guys<00:03:42.030> so<00:03:42.180> if
