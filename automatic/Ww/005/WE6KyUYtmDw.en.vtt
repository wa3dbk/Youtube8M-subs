just<00:02:20.630> wait<00:02:21.319> until<00:02:21.940> this<00:02:22.940> block<00:02:23.269> of<00:02:23.420> wood<00:02:23.450> or

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
just wait until this block of wood or

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.339 
just wait until this block of wood or
even<00:02:23.870> this<00:02:24.680> one<00:02:24.950> catches<00:02:25.940> fire<00:02:26.329> on<00:02:26.630> top<00:02:27.140> of

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
even this one catches fire on top of

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:32.710 
even this one catches fire on top of
them<00:02:27.560> and<00:02:27.920> now<00:02:30.130> 100<00:02:31.130> spider<00:02:31.640> so<00:02:32.360> now<00:02:32.510> when

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
them and now 100 spider so now when

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.479 
them and now 100 spider so now when
these<00:02:33.110> two<00:02:33.170> catch<00:02:33.980> fire<00:02:34.310> they<00:02:34.579> will<00:02:34.940> hopefully

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
these two catch fire they will hopefully

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.890 
these two catch fire they will hopefully
like<00:02:37.959> send<00:02:38.959> the<00:02:39.349> fire<00:02:39.620> to<00:02:39.950> that<00:02:40.069> block<00:02:40.430> and

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
like send the fire to that block and

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.650 
like send the fire to that block and
hopefully<00:02:41.900> before<00:02:42.290> it<00:02:42.650> burns<00:02:42.920> out<00:02:43.220> so<00:02:43.849> when

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
hopefully before it burns out so when

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:51.789 
hopefully before it burns out so when
that<00:02:45.260> happens<00:02:46.510> this<00:02:47.510> will<00:02:47.750> actually<00:02:50.260> put<00:02:51.260> fire

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
that happens this will actually put fire

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.430 
that happens this will actually put fire
in<00:02:52.160> on<00:02:52.940> this<00:02:53.389> block<00:02:53.660> on<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:53.930> side<00:02:54.139> of<00:02:54.170> this

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
in on this block on the side of this

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.680 
in on this block on the side of this
block<00:02:54.709> but<00:02:55.670> inside<00:02:56.000> of<00:02:56.120> this<00:02:56.239> block<00:02:56.540> is

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
block but inside of this block is

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.900 
block but inside of this block is
actually<00:02:56.810> this<00:02:57.139> block<00:02:57.440> so<00:02:57.769> it<00:02:58.130> will<00:02:58.549> lit<00:02:58.760> up

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
actually this block so it will lit up

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.539 
actually this block so it will lit up
the<00:02:59.030> nether<00:02:59.180> portal<00:03:00.040> because<00:03:01.040> I<00:03:01.280> actually

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
the nether portal because I actually
