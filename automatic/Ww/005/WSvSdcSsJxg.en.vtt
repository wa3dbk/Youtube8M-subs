00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:06.849
 or unblocking a bacteria from things 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:08.770
 more annoying than there is because nobody 

00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:11.290
 He wants to be delving into a toilet are 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:14.530
 dirty and only have bad things 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.180
 harmful but fortunately there are 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.179
 different instruments to be able 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.619
 do it like for example this this one is 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:22.989
 I could say that it is the simplest 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.989
 only thing to do is put this 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:29.289
 nozzle in the inlet of the 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:32.050
 toilet and tightening this creates a vacuum that 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.000
 makes the traffic jam that is 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.160
 causing the problems 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.780
 another way also to unclog a 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.090
 toilet would be with the typical brushes 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.490
 like that of the serranos 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.110
 all he does is push and if the 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:47.500
 jam is very superficial if it is fair 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.030
 in the mouth as it moves it releases it and a 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.400
 Once you can pass the water pull the 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:55.590
 chain and the water goes away as if it were a 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.590
 river when the problems are more 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.250
 deeper let's say when they are more 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.960
 beyond the toilet entrance when 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.460
 they are inside the pipe and we do not have 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.119
 access we can not reach or with 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.740
 brushes and this also serves us there 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.479
 another type of plunger is like this 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.400
 that are chemicals that what it does is 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.820
 undo what is causing the 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.250
 jam is as if there is acid I do not know 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:22.210
 what kind of acid will be I do not know exactly 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.460
 I do not know, I only know that this is undone by this 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.550
 how to use it is normally miss 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.680
 the corresponding dose and just above 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.259
 then you throw water almost boiling 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.550
 in the instructions it clearly puts you 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.680
 what needs to be done so there's no 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.270
 eye problem you have to be careful 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.610
 because this is dangerous if we drop our 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.990
 hands are the eyes you have to have a lot 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.750
 watch out 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.800
 as well 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.180
 the bad thing is to say the point again 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.580
 negative to use this type of rooms 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.370
 heats that can cause damage to the 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.110
 pipes with what suits me do not 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.340
 go through the dose or use it very 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.050
 often we will not be charged 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.840
 a pipe and then yes the 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.460
 we will have bundled 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.289
 but thanks to the internet they are discovered 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.840
 strange things and there is also another type 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:08.479
 of remedies that are homemade to be able 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.120
 undo a jam in a toilet and is to use 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.160
 a mop imagine that this person 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.710
 had the stick now let's see with a 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.200
 example but 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:20.050
 and this just enter a 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.880
 mop for if we do not want to stain the 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.410
 because of course if there is a traffic jam 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.950
 Typically , the water in the cup 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.990
 be full of you do not say that but 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.760
 it smells really bad in the case is that if not 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.150
 you want to stain the mop of the metis 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.650
 in a bag 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.879
 and we agreed that the club has to be 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.579
 here as if not to see how he handles 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:41.439
 jce to thais so that the water does not enter 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:44.349
 inside the bag and simply with the 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:47.140
 gesture of raising and lowering the mop on the 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:49.000
 hole is creating vacuum in such a way 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.450
 that in a mysterious magical way 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.010
 unexplained the jam is going to be used 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.900
 last time I had a very bad jam 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.330
 strong that not even the plunger 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.820
 chemist helped me 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.310
 and for trying to use this method and 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:06.420
 It worked wonders let's see 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.420
 how each of them is used 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:15.930
 method 1 the typical brush 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.930
 to push until it goes to the jam 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.940
 method 2 the plunger we put it in 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:28.040
 the entrance and we squeeze 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.040
 we squeeze until he goes 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.360
 method 3 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.860
 the chemical plunger we take the dose 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.680
 tell us the manufacturer that puts it 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:42.519
 more instructions and then 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.519
 a jet 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.730
 of boiling water 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.730
 or almost boiling 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.060
 and method 4 but not less effective that yes 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.299
 the simplest and the cheapest 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.640
 surely it's the mop I've 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:02.019
 put the mop in a bag so that 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.239
 do not get dirty in this case like there is not 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.549
 water for no good no matter jam 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.730
 but if we let him the hairs 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.810
 they are loose in poinsettia 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.360
 just with getting into the jam and 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:18.989
 start moving up and down 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.989
 I assure you that the traffic jam will disappear
