00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:07.680
OK, this is a new area I've been researching
lately.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.460
This is Nitinol metal, which you may or may
not have heard of.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.539
It's memory metal.

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:23.320
Essentially you can put it in warm water,
or heat it, and it returns to it's original

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.600
form.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:34.320
Cool it down, and... it's like clay.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.230
Soon as it hits the warm water, back to your
original shape.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:46.120
Now you can buy this stuff in a lot of different
shapes and forms.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:55.600
Until you play around with it though, you
don't realize how amazing this stuff really

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.339
is.

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:07.590
Ridgeway Banks actually invented the worlds
first solid state heat engine back in November

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.410
of 1973.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:18.640
That was the first time that heat had been
converted directly into mechanical energy.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:28.460
And his motor was composed of Nitinol wires,
on a rounded wheel frame.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:37.060
Now, he tested this thing and after it had
run for 23 million revolutions he found that

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.060
it was running stronger than when it had started.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:50.340
The force of Nitinol heat activated shape
shifting has recorded at as much as 55 tons

00:01:50.340 --> 00:02:10.700
per square inch.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.519
Research has found that using Nitinol as a
source of energy conversion would be substantially

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:27.090
cheaper than nuclear power.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:40.420
An interesting note, if you heat Nitinol metal
to 500 degrees celcius, whatever shape you

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.909
have it in will become it's new memory shape.

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:51.610
Once you cool it down, it will return to the
new shape, every time you heat it back up.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:03:00.099
So why isn't this stuff being used regularly,
you've got to ask yourself.

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:16.769
It's amazing what you can do with this stuff.

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:22.910
As you can see, it snaps back into it's original
shape instantly.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:33.849
And with a force you just wouldn't believe.

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:39.939
See.

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:45.280
This is embedded in so tight that you can't
even remove it.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.489
Until you cool it down.

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:56.129
And no matter how much you bend this stuff,
stretch it, contort it and try to twist it

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:58.629
out of shape...

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:02.019
It instantly goes back.

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:13.130
Now the other interesting thing about Nitinol,
is that you can train it, to shape into two

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.439
forms.

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:24.320
The original form, and the shape that you
train it to change into.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:31.620
It's pretty neat stuff.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.450
So.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:46.540
What I'm going to be doing here is working
on a small prototype Nitinol Heat Engine.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:52.480
I just wanted to post the preliminaries here,
and let you see what I'm working on.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.950
Thanks for watching.
