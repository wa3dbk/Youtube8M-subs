00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
difficult if I was gonna be nitpicky the

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.470 
difficult if I was gonna be nitpicky the
only<00:02:43.010> thing<00:02:43.220> I<00:02:43.370> would<00:02:43.520> say<00:02:43.550> is<00:02:44.000> that<00:02:44.030> some<00:02:44.450> of

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
only thing I would say is that some of

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.030 
only thing I would say is that some of
the<00:02:44.630> rubber<00:02:44.870> parts<00:02:45.320> on<00:02:45.500> it<00:02:45.650> like<00:02:45.830> on<00:02:46.010> the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
the rubber parts on it like on the

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.710 
the rubber parts on it like on the
buttons<00:02:46.520> on<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:46.850> top<00:02:47.060> where<00:02:47.300> you've<00:02:47.390> got<00:02:47.540> like

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
buttons on the top where you've got like

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.550 
buttons on the top where you've got like
volume<00:02:48.020> and<00:02:48.380> power<00:02:48.530> buttons<00:02:48.970> little<00:02:49.970> bit<00:02:50.150> too

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
volume and power buttons little bit too

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.110 
volume and power buttons little bit too
rubbery<00:02:51.560> and<00:02:51.950> cheap<00:02:52.190> I<00:02:52.370> mean<00:02:52.520> it<00:02:52.640> doesn't<00:02:52.850> go

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
rubbery and cheap I mean it doesn't go

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.850 
rubbery and cheap I mean it doesn't go
with<00:02:53.330> the<00:02:53.510> classy<00:02:53.930> feel<00:02:54.170> that<00:02:54.410> you<00:02:54.530> get<00:02:54.710> with

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
with the classy feel that you get with

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.500 
with the classy feel that you get with
the<00:02:54.950> rest<00:02:55.130> of<00:02:55.250> it<00:02:55.400> and<00:02:55.910> obviously<00:02:56.240> there<00:02:56.390> are

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
the rest of it and obviously there are

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.990 
the rest of it and obviously there are
some<00:02:56.630> rubber<00:02:56.870> feet<00:02:57.110> on<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.320> bottom<00:02:57.820> again<00:02:58.820> the

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
some rubber feet on the bottom again the

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.760 
some rubber feet on the bottom again the
same<00:02:59.240> thing<00:02:59.540> they<00:02:59.840> could<00:03:00.020> possibly<00:03:00.170> be<00:03:00.590> better

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
same thing they could possibly be better

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.710 
same thing they could possibly be better
but<00:03:01.190> it<00:03:01.490> doesn't<00:03:01.520> make<00:03:02.000> any<00:03:02.240> difference<00:03:02.450> that

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
but it doesn't make any difference that

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.650 
but it doesn't make any difference that
performance<00:03:03.350> of<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:03.560> speaker<00:03:04.300> overall<00:03:05.300> if<00:03:05.570> I

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
performance of the speaker overall if I

were to give it the mark out of five for

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.699 
were to give it the mark out of five for
instance<00:03:08.150> it<00:03:08.300> would<00:03:08.390> be<00:03:08.450> a<00:03:08.600> full<00:03:08.959> five<00:03:09.260> I<00:03:09.560> mean

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709

almost four hundred dollars I would

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.140 
almost four hundred dollars I would
struggle<00:03:15.560> to<00:03:15.860> find<00:03:16.040> anything<00:03:16.520> that<00:03:16.850> gives<00:03:17.060> you

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
struggle to find anything that gives you

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.870 
struggle to find anything that gives you
better<00:03:17.330> results<00:03:18.160> you<00:03:19.160> can<00:03:19.310> spend<00:03:19.610> more<00:03:19.820> you

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
better results you can spend more you
