00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
next up is feet and thankfully we're

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.320 
next up is feet and thankfully we're
gonna<00:00:04.230> keep<00:00:04.500> mr.<00:00:04.859> squeegees<00:00:05.250> feet<00:00:05.520> very

gonna keep mr. squeegees feet very
simple<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:07.410> model<00:00:07.710> just<00:00:07.859> has<00:00:08.069> two<00:00:08.370> pieces<00:00:08.820> per

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
simple the model just has two pieces per

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.870 
simple the model just has two pieces per
foot<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.719> heel<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.559> toe<00:00:10.590> and<00:00:11.040> we're

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
foot the heel and the toe and we're

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.490 
foot the heel and the toe and we're
gonna<00:00:12.000> take<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.360> easy<00:00:12.389> way<00:00:12.840> out<00:00:12.870> for<00:00:13.200> this<00:00:13.290> rig

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
gonna take the easy way out for this rig

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.000 
gonna take the easy way out for this rig
and<00:00:13.740> just<00:00:14.190> have<00:00:14.370> one<00:00:14.730> bone<00:00:15.000> for<00:00:15.269> each<00:00:15.770> but<00:00:16.770> even

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
and just have one bone for each but even

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.220 
and just have one bone for each but even
so<00:00:17.279> there<00:00:18.119> are<00:00:18.300> some<00:00:18.570> things<00:00:18.810> that<00:00:18.900> we<00:00:19.050> need<00:00:19.199> to

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
so there are some things that we need to

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.429 
so there are some things that we need to
think<00:00:19.439> about<00:00:19.970> the<00:00:20.970> first<00:00:21.240> is<00:00:21.480> translation<00:00:22.170> and

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
think about the first is translation and

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.160 
think about the first is translation and
rotation<00:00:22.470> axes<00:00:23.449> the<00:00:24.449> translation<00:00:25.019> and

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
rotation axes the translation and

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.259 
rotation axes the translation and
rotation<00:00:25.230> axes<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.160> bones<00:00:26.400> are<00:00:26.670> determined<00:00:27.119> by

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
rotation axes of bones are determined by

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.269 
rotation axes of bones are determined by
the<00:00:27.330> bones<00:00:27.599> orientation<00:00:28.439> in<00:00:28.590> edit<00:00:28.859> mode<00:00:28.890> I

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
the bones orientation in edit mode I

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.060 
the bones orientation in edit mode I
touched<00:00:30.269> on<00:00:30.390> this<00:00:30.449> briefly<00:00:30.750> before<00:00:31.109> but<00:00:31.560> I'm

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
touched on this briefly before but I'm

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.950 
touched on this briefly before but I'm
going<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.340> go<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.520> bit<00:00:32.669> more<00:00:32.969> in-depth<00:00:33.450> into<00:00:33.840> it

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
going to go a bit more in-depth into it

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.470 
going to go a bit more in-depth into it
now<00:00:34.579> let's<00:00:35.579> take<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.760> look<00:00:36.030> at<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.210> armature

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
now let's take a look at this armature

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.110 
now let's take a look at this armature
I've<00:00:36.690> prepared<00:00:37.020> for<00:00:37.140> us<00:00:37.489> we<00:00:38.489> can<00:00:38.610> see<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.940> rest

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
I've prepared for us we can see the rest

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.790 
I've prepared for us we can see the rest
position<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.809> bones<00:00:39.960> by<00:00:40.200> entering<00:00:40.559> edit

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
position of the bones by entering edit

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.369 
position of the bones by entering edit
mode<00:00:40.950> on<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.190> armature<00:00:41.460> I've<00:00:42.120> enabled<00:00:42.750> access

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
mode on the armature I've enabled access

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.049 
mode on the armature I've enabled access
displays<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.129> we<00:00:44.190> can<00:00:44.340> see<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.670> axes<00:00:45.030> of

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
displays so that we can see the axes of

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.750 
displays so that we can see the axes of
the<00:00:45.180> bones<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.780> we<00:00:46.620> can<00:00:46.739> see<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.160> y-axis

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
the bones and we can see that the y-axis

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.229 
the bones and we can see that the y-axis
of<00:00:47.910> this<00:00:48.090> bone<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:49.200> pointing<00:00:49.710> off<00:00:49.890> at<00:00:50.039> an<00:00:50.129> angle

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
of this bone is pointing off at an angle

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.729 
of this bone is pointing off at an angle
now<00:00:53.239> if<00:00:53.449> we<00:00:53.570> go<00:00:53.660> into<00:00:53.690> pose<00:00:54.140> mode<00:00:54.170> and<00:00:54.590> play

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
now if we go into pose mode and play

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.160 
now if we go into pose mode and play
with<00:00:54.949> this<00:00:55.039> bones<00:00:55.340> why<00:00:55.550> translation<00:00:56.210> we<00:00:56.960> see

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
with this bones why translation we see

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.049 
with this bones why translation we see
that<00:00:57.379> the<00:00:57.469> bone<00:00:57.590> moves<00:00:58.010> along<00:00:58.370> that<00:00:58.610> local

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
that the bone moves along that local

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.630 
that the bone moves along that local
axis<00:00:59.480> of<00:00:59.629> the<00:00:59.750> bone<00:00:59.930> even<00:01:00.920> if<00:01:01.010> we<00:01:01.129> rotate<00:01:01.519> the

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
axis of the bone even if we rotate the

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.790 
axis of the bone even if we rotate the
bone<00:01:01.760> in<00:01:01.940> pose<00:01:02.120> mode<00:01:02.149> that<00:01:03.140> original<00:01:03.530> edit

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
bone in pose mode that original edit

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.439 
bone in pose mode that original edit
mode<00:01:03.980> orientation<00:01:04.699> is<00:01:04.879> still<00:01:05.299> what

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
mode orientation is still what

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.380 
mode orientation is still what
determines<00:01:05.900> the<00:01:06.049> translation<00:01:06.619> axes<00:01:07.390> moreover

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
determines the translation axes moreover

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.539 
determines the translation axes moreover
if<00:01:08.540> we<00:01:08.570> give<00:01:08.810> the<00:01:08.930> y<00:01:09.020> translation<00:01:09.649> a<00:01:09.860> value<00:01:10.430> of

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
if we give the y translation a value of

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:12.940 
if we give the y translation a value of
say<00:01:11.000> 3<00:01:11.299> and<00:01:11.540> then<00:01:12.229> change<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:12.770> bones

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
say 3 and then change the bones

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.720 
say 3 and then change the bones
orientation<00:01:13.580> in<00:01:13.700> edit<00:01:14.000> mode

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:15.730 
orientation in edit mode

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.550 
orientation in edit mode
then<00:01:16.730> in<00:01:16.880> pose<00:01:17.150> mode<00:01:17.420> its<00:01:17.690> position<00:01:18.140> changes

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
then in pose mode its position changes

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.370 
then in pose mode its position changes
this<00:01:19.550> is<00:01:19.730> because<00:01:20.030> the<00:01:20.180> y<00:01:20.300> translation<00:01:20.990> value

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
this is because the y translation value

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.070 
this is because the y translation value
is<00:01:21.590> now<00:01:21.980> operating<00:01:22.580> on<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:22.820> new<00:01:23.030> y<00:01:23.270> axis<00:01:23.810> and

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
is now operating on the new y axis and

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.590 
is now operating on the new y axis and
is<00:01:24.740> going<00:01:24.980> in<00:01:25.100> this<00:01:25.250> direction<00:01:25.310> instead<00:01:26.000> of

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
is going in this direction instead of

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.469 
is going in this direction instead of
this<00:01:26.810> direction<00:01:27.050> like<00:01:27.440> it<00:01:27.590> was<00:01:27.710> before<00:01:28.479> this

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
this direction like it was before this

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.570 
this direction like it was before this
applies<00:01:29.840> for<00:01:30.140> all<00:01:30.170> of<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:30.680> translation<00:01:31.220> axes

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
applies for all of the translation axes

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.960 
applies for all of the translation axes
not<00:01:32.390> just<00:01:32.660> the<00:01:32.750> y<00:01:32.900> translation<00:01:33.530> axis<00:01:33.920> and<00:01:34.160> it

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
not just the y translation axis and it

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.900 
not just the y translation axis and it
also<00:01:35.119> applies<00:01:35.570> to<00:01:35.600> the<00:01:35.840> rotation<00:01:36.380> axes<00:01:36.740> if<00:01:37.040> we

also applies to the rotation axes if we

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.700 
also applies to the rotation axes if we
switch<00:01:38.150> the<00:01:38.360> bone<00:01:38.540> to<00:01:38.750> Euler<00:01:39.050> rotation<00:01:39.500> and

spaces<00:03:38.060> are<00:03:38.239> an<00:03:38.389> important<00:03:38.900> concept<00:03:39.290> in

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:39.469 
spaces are an important concept in

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:41.619 
spaces are an important concept in
computer<00:03:39.620> graphics<00:03:39.920> and<00:03:40.430> rigging<00:03:41.090> but<00:03:41.540> they

computer graphics and rigging but they

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:43.209 
computer graphics and rigging but they
can<00:03:41.750> also<00:03:41.900> be<00:03:42.109> kind<00:03:42.409> of<00:03:42.530> mind-bending

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:43.219 
can also be kind of mind-bending

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:45.250 
can also be kind of mind-bending
so<00:03:43.819> for<00:03:44.120> now<00:03:44.239> I'll<00:03:44.540> just<00:03:44.569> leave<00:03:44.780> it<00:03:45.019> at<00:03:45.109> this

animating in local space and that's why

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
we care about this with the foot we want

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.429 
we care about this with the foot we want
to<00:04:07.639> place<00:04:07.849> the<00:04:08.060> foot<00:04:08.239> bones<00:04:08.480> so<00:04:09.139> that<00:04:09.169> their

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:09.439 
to place the foot bones so that their

to place the foot bones so that their

local translation and rotation axes make

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:14.379 
local translation and rotation axes make
sense<00:04:12.439> for<00:04:12.590> the<00:04:12.709> animator<00:04:13.069> if<00:04:13.310> we<00:04:14.090> put<00:04:14.269> the

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:14.389 
sense for the animator if we put the

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:16.150 
sense for the animator if we put the
foot<00:04:14.659> bone<00:04:14.840> at<00:04:15.019> an<00:04:15.139> angle<00:04:15.620> then<00:04:15.980> there

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
foot bone at an angle then there

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.490 
foot bone at an angle then there
wouldn't<00:04:16.370> be<00:04:16.459> a<00:04:16.549> simple<00:04:17.060> single<00:04:17.419> axis<00:04:18.079> for<00:04:18.349> up

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
wouldn't be a simple single axis for up

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.140 
wouldn't be a simple single axis for up
and<00:04:18.680> down<00:04:18.859> also

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
and down also

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.450 
and down also
there<00:04:20.539> wouldn't<00:04:20.780> be<00:04:20.840> a<00:04:20.930> simple<00:04:21.470> single<00:04:21.829> axis

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
there wouldn't be a simple single axis

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.450 
there wouldn't be a simple single axis
for<00:04:22.970> pivoting<00:04:23.330> the<00:04:23.389> foot<00:04:23.659> around<00:04:23.780> its<00:04:24.080> heel

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
for pivoting the foot around its heel

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.710 
for pivoting the foot around its heel
but<00:04:25.460> it's<00:04:25.610> helpful<00:04:25.909> for<00:04:26.030> the<00:04:26.240> animator<00:04:26.630> to

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
but it's helpful for the animator to

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.870 
but it's helpful for the animator to
have<00:04:26.900> those<00:04:27.139> simple<00:04:27.530> well<00:04:27.949> aligned<00:04:28.310> axes

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
have those simple well aligned axes

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.820 
have those simple well aligned axes
because<00:04:29.570> it<00:04:29.659> makes<00:04:29.840> it<00:04:29.960> simpler<00:04:30.229> for<00:04:30.500> them<00:04:30.590> to

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
because it makes it simpler for them to

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.279 
because it makes it simpler for them to
for<00:04:31.250> example<00:04:31.729> tweak<00:04:32.270> just<00:04:32.630> the<00:04:32.810> height<00:04:33.020> of<00:04:33.199> the

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:33.289 
for example tweak just the height of the

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:35.409 
for example tweak just the height of the
foot<00:04:33.500> or<00:04:33.650> manage<00:04:34.490> the<00:04:34.639> interpolation<00:04:35.150> of<00:04:35.360> the

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
foot or manage the interpolation of the

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.180 
foot or manage the interpolation of the
height<00:04:35.599> of<00:04:35.630> the<00:04:35.750> foot<00:04:35.960> and<00:04:36.260> these<00:04:37.070> are

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
height of the foot and these are

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.620 
height of the foot and these are
important<00:04:37.580> things<00:04:37.610> for<00:04:37.970> the<00:04:38.030> animator<00:04:38.419> to<00:04:38.449> be

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
important things for the animator to be

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.000 
important things for the animator to be
able<00:04:38.690> to<00:04:38.930> do<00:04:40.570> so<00:04:41.570> for<00:04:41.750> our<00:04:41.870> foot<00:04:42.199> rig<00:04:42.409> we<00:04:42.830> need

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
able to do so for our foot rig we need

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.070 
able to do so for our foot rig we need
two<00:04:43.250> bones<00:04:43.460> the<00:04:44.000> main<00:04:44.180> foot<00:04:44.419> bone<00:04:44.570> in<00:04:44.780> the<00:04:44.900> toe

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
two bones the main foot bone in the toe

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.589 
two bones the main foot bone in the toe
and<00:04:45.340> the<00:04:46.340> toe<00:04:46.370> will<00:04:46.820> be<00:04:46.940> the<00:04:47.060> child<00:04:47.300> of<00:04:47.479> the

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:47.599 
and the toe will be the child of the

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:51.040 
and the toe will be the child of the
foot<00:04:47.780> and<00:04:49.389> since<00:04:50.389> we<00:04:50.539> want<00:04:50.690> them<00:04:50.840> to<00:04:50.870> have

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
foot and since we want them to have

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.170 
foot and since we want them to have
their<00:04:51.169> axes<00:04:51.620> nicely<00:04:52.039> aligned<00:04:52.370> let's<00:04:53.000> make

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
their axes nicely aligned let's make

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.129 
their axes nicely aligned let's make
them<00:04:53.470> horizontally<00:04:54.470> straight<00:04:55.960> to<00:04:56.960> keep

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
them horizontally straight to keep

them horizontally straight to keep
things<00:04:57.349> simple<00:04:57.740> we're<00:04:58.009> going<00:04:58.039> to<00:04:58.310> assume<00:04:58.580> that

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
things simple we're going to assume that

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:00.850 
things simple we're going to assume that
the<00:04:58.880> foot<00:04:59.030> bone<00:04:59.210> will<00:04:59.479> be<00:04:59.599> the<00:04:59.780> direct<00:05:00.169> target

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
the foot bone will be the direct target

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.040 
the foot bone will be the direct target
of<00:05:01.009> the<00:05:01.099> IKE<00:05:01.250> a<00:05:01.280> leg<00:05:01.699> so<00:05:02.419> that<00:05:02.449> means<00:05:02.780> that<00:05:02.960> it

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
of the IKE a leg so that means that it

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.659 
of the IKE a leg so that means that it
will<00:05:03.139> need<00:05:03.259> to<00:05:03.349> be<00:05:03.440> positioned<00:05:03.979> where<00:05:04.250> the<00:05:04.520> leg

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
will need to be positioned where the leg

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:06.010 
will need to be positioned where the leg
is<00:05:04.789> going<00:05:04.940> to<00:05:05.000> connect<00:05:05.300> to<00:05:05.419> it<00:05:05.539> which<00:05:05.720> is<00:05:05.750> at

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
is going to connect to it which is at

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.200 
is going to connect to it which is at
the<00:05:06.139> ankle<00:05:06.440> and<00:05:06.650> that's<00:05:07.430> just<00:05:07.639> a<00:05:07.729> bit<00:05:08.000> higher

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
the ankle and that's just a bit higher

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.050 
the ankle and that's just a bit higher
than<00:05:08.449> the<00:05:08.570> toe

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
than the toe

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.720 
than the toe
we<00:05:10.900> also<00:05:11.110> want<00:05:11.410> to<00:05:11.470> consider<00:05:11.830> which<00:05:12.010> axis<00:05:12.520> is

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.730 
we also want to consider which axis is

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.930 
we also want to consider which axis is
the<00:05:13.180> up<00:05:13.360> axis<00:05:13.780> for<00:05:13.960> the<00:05:14.050> foot<00:05:14.230> in<00:05:14.550> blender<00:05:15.550> the

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
the up axis for the foot in blender the

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.120 
the up axis for the foot in blender the
z-axis<00:05:16.180> is<00:05:16.540> considered<00:05:17.140> the<00:05:17.350> de<00:05:17.560> facto<00:05:17.980> up

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
z-axis is considered the de facto up

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.670 
z-axis is considered the de facto up
axis<00:05:18.610> since<00:05:19.240> that's<00:05:19.510> what<00:05:19.750> worldspace<00:05:20.140> uses

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
axis since that's what worldspace uses

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.340 
axis since that's what worldspace uses
let's<00:05:21.640> turn<00:05:21.820> on<00:05:21.910> axis<00:05:22.360> visualization<00:05:23.050> so<00:05:23.200> that

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
let's turn on axis visualization so that

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.400 
let's turn on axis visualization so that
we<00:05:23.440> can<00:05:23.590> see<00:05:24.040> if<00:05:24.130> that's<00:05:24.250> what<00:05:24.400> we<00:05:24.550> have<00:05:24.700> or<00:05:24.820> not

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
we can see if that's what we have or not

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.870 
we can see if that's what we have or not
uh-oh<00:05:26.410> looks<00:05:27.250> like<00:05:27.340> we<00:05:27.490> have<00:05:27.730> some

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:43.920 
you can also change the bones role in

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.350 
you can also change the bones role in

you want now in pose mode we also want

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.179 
you want now in pose mode we also want

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
a squeegee we really only needed to

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.290 
a squeegee we really only needed to
rotate<00:06:07.020> on<00:06:07.139> one<00:06:07.319> axis<00:06:07.759> that<00:06:08.759> means<00:06:08.819> that<00:06:09.240> we

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
rotate on one axis that means that we

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.290 
rotate on one axis that means that we
should<00:06:09.509> first<00:06:09.870> switch<00:06:10.259> it<00:06:10.379> to<00:06:10.409> Euler<00:06:10.860> and<00:06:11.300> lock

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
should first switch it to Euler and lock

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.020 
should first switch it to Euler and lock
all<00:06:12.509> of<00:06:12.659> its<00:06:12.780> axes<00:06:13.199> except<00:06:13.740> the<00:06:13.889> x<00:06:14.099> axis<00:06:14.610> which

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.030 
all of its axes except the x axis which

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.899 
all of its axes except the x axis which
is<00:06:15.090> what<00:06:15.449> we<00:06:15.539> wanted<00:06:15.750> to<00:06:15.870> rotate<00:06:16.199> on<00:06:16.639> toes<00:06:17.639> are

00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:17.909 
is what we wanted to rotate on toes are

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:21.140 
is what we wanted to rotate on toes are
also<00:06:18.060> typically<00:06:18.599> attached<00:06:19.500> to<00:06:19.919> their<00:06:20.069> foot<00:06:20.370> so

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.150 
also typically attached to their foot so

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.089 
also typically attached to their foot so
let's<00:06:21.330> lock<00:06:21.539> the<00:06:21.569> toes<00:06:21.870> translation<00:06:22.530> axes<00:06:22.889> too

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:23.099 
let's lock the toes translation axes too

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:26.540 
let's lock the toes translation axes too
so<00:06:23.370> it<00:06:23.520> doesn't<00:06:23.849> separate<00:06:24.360> from<00:06:24.569> the<00:06:24.690> foot<00:06:25.550> now

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.550 
so it doesn't separate from the foot now

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.640 
so it doesn't separate from the foot now
the<00:06:26.610> foot<00:06:26.909> itself<00:06:27.270> we<00:06:27.659> can<00:06:27.870> pretty<00:06:28.199> much<00:06:28.289> leave

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:28.650 
the foot itself we can pretty much leave

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.770 
the foot itself we can pretty much leave
alone<00:06:28.889> it<00:06:29.669> needs<00:06:29.879> to<00:06:30.000> be<00:06:30.120> able<00:06:30.300> to<00:06:30.389> translate

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 
alone it needs to be able to translate

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.559 
alone it needs to be able to translate
so<00:06:31.259> no<00:06:31.770> locking<00:06:32.190> there<00:06:32.370> and<00:06:32.639> it<00:06:33.449> is

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:33.569 
so no locking there and it is

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:35.330 
so no locking there and it is
potentially<00:06:33.930> gonna<00:06:34.319> be<00:06:34.469> rotating<00:06:34.949> on<00:06:35.069> all

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.340 
potentially gonna be rotating on all

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.820 
potentially gonna be rotating on all
rotation<00:06:35.879> axes<00:06:36.210> so<00:06:36.690> quaternions<00:06:37.379> make<00:06:37.590> sense

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:37.830 
rotation axes so quaternions make sense

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.640 
rotation axes so quaternions make sense
for<00:06:38.069> us<00:06:38.190> and<00:06:39.110> there<00:06:40.110> we<00:06:40.259> go

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:40.650 
for us and there we go

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.180 
for us and there we go
a<00:06:40.680> super<00:06:41.520> duper<00:06:42.110> stupidly<00:06:43.110> simple<00:06:43.590> foot<00:06:43.979> rig

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:44.190 
a super duper stupidly simple foot rig

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.179 
a super duper stupidly simple foot rig
and<00:06:44.490> yes<00:06:45.330> somehow<00:06:45.690> I<00:06:46.139> still<00:06:46.199> managed<00:06:46.860> to<00:06:46.889> fit

00:06:47.179 --> 00:06:47.189 
and yes somehow I still managed to fit

00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:51.229 
and yes somehow I still managed to fit
in<00:06:47.310> a<00:06:47.460> confusing<00:06:47.939> topic<00:06:48.229> woohoo
