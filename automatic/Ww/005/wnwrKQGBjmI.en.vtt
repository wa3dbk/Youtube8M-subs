00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
first part of the bolt right here as you

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.960 
first part of the bolt right here as you
can<00:00:17.880> see<00:00:18.119> this<00:00:18.810> hole<00:00:19.080> is<00:00:19.289> where<00:00:19.560> I'm<00:00:19.710> uh<00:00:19.880> put<00:00:20.880> in

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
can see this hole is where I'm uh put in

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.590 
can see this hole is where I'm uh put in
the<00:00:21.090> firing<00:00:21.510> pin<00:00:22.130> the<00:00:23.130> firing<00:00:23.490> thing<00:00:23.519> is<00:00:23.910> going

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
the firing pin the firing thing is going

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.140 
the firing pin the firing thing is going
to<00:00:24.689> be<00:00:25.050> like<00:00:25.529> this<00:00:26.220> piece<00:00:26.490> of<00:00:26.640> coat<00:00:26.820> hanger<00:00:27.119> or

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
to be like this piece of coat hanger or

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.689 
to be like this piece of coat hanger or
I<00:00:27.300> might<00:00:27.660> put<00:00:28.080> something<00:00:28.470> more<00:00:29.099> solid<00:00:29.340> in

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
I might put something more solid in

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.780 
I might put something more solid in
there<00:00:29.910> almost<00:00:30.750> called<00:00:31.140> I<00:00:31.410> made<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.099> really

there almost called I made a really
really<00:00:33.239> thick<00:00:33.930> piece<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.649> paper<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.790> this

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
really thick piece of paper and this

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.930 
really thick piece of paper and this
this<00:00:36.960> little<00:00:37.290> piece<00:00:37.739> of<00:00:37.890> paper<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.670> going<00:00:38.850> to

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
this little piece of paper is going to

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.810 
this little piece of paper is going to
go<00:00:39.059> on<00:00:39.090> inside<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.140> inside<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.890> here<00:00:41.160> so

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
go on inside of a inside of here so

going to be here and then I'm gonna have
the<00:00:46.250> firing<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:48.090> firing<00:00:48.450> pin<00:00:48.719> spring<00:00:48.950> here

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
the firing the firing pin spring here

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.860 
the firing the firing pin spring here
and<00:00:50.160> then<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.340> have<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.000> do<00:00:51.239> another<00:00:51.449> on<00:00:51.809> the

and then I have to do another on the
other<00:00:52.469> part<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.920> flanks<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.629> another

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
other part of the flanks of another

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.279 
other part of the flanks of another
piece<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.199> paper<00:00:55.379> on<00:00:55.559> here<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.570> firing<00:00:57.930> pin

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
piece of paper on here so the firing pin

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.970 
piece of paper on here so the firing pin
can<00:00:58.469> we<00:00:58.620> stay<00:00:59.100> retained<00:00:59.760> into<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.859> into<00:01:01.859> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
can we stay retained into the into the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.679 
can we stay retained into the into the
bolt<00:01:02.420> right<00:01:03.420> here<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:04.019> we<00:01:04.140> already<00:01:04.379> have<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
bolt right here and we already have the

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.370 
bolt right here and we already have the
the<00:01:06.689> chamber<00:01:07.170> for<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.070> for<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.640> round<00:01:09.170> as<00:01:10.170> you

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
the chamber for the for the round as you

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.730 
the chamber for the for the round as you
can<00:01:10.500> see<00:01:10.710> I'm<00:01:10.830> using<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:11.310> 3<00:01:13.640> 300<00:01:15.350> here<00:01:16.350> we<00:01:16.530> have

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
can see I'm using a 3 300 here we have

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.690 
can see I'm using a 3 300 here we have
the<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.340> chamber<00:01:19.549> perfectly<00:01:20.549> round<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.439> I

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
the the chamber perfectly round and I

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.210 
the the chamber perfectly round and I
made<00:01:23.700> enough<00:01:24.000> head<00:01:24.270> spacing<00:01:24.840> because<00:01:25.619> um<00:01:25.920> I

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
made enough head spacing because um I

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.399 
made enough head spacing because um I
took<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.850> little<00:01:27.030> bit<00:01:27.270> more<00:01:27.540> off<00:01:27.689> than<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.259> head

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
took a little bit more off than the head

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.920 
took a little bit more off than the head
spacing<00:01:28.799> because<00:01:28.979> i'ma<00:01:29.490> put<00:01:30.150> what's<00:01:30.720> called

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
spacing because i'ma put what's called

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.319 
spacing because i'ma put what's called
the<00:01:31.670> locking<00:01:33.860> the<00:01:34.860> eight<00:01:35.009> locking<00:01:35.549> lugs<00:01:35.790> that

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
the locking the eight locking lugs that

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.770 
the locking the eight locking lugs that
go<00:01:36.479> from<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:37.500> bolt<00:01:37.770> which<00:01:38.329> which<00:01:39.329> is<00:01:39.509> really

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
go from the bolt which which is really

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.830 
go from the bolt which which is really
similar<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.380> an<00:01:40.500> m16<00:01:41.189> or<00:01:42.350> ar-15s<00:01:43.350> bolt<00:01:44.840> it's

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
similar to an m16 or ar-15s bolt it's

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.899 
similar to an m16 or ar-15s bolt it's
going<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:45.990> have<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.340> extractor<00:01:47.340> pin<00:01:47.549> here

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
going to have the extractor pin here

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.780 
going to have the extractor pin here
well<00:01:48.570> that's<00:01:49.170> going<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.380> be<00:01:49.439> similar<00:01:49.829> this<00:01:50.610> can

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
well that's going to be similar this can

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.600 
well that's going to be similar this can
be<00:01:50.820> in<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.210> same<00:01:51.390> shape<00:01:51.600> as<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.840> as<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.890> bolt<00:01:53.250> and

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
be in the same shape as a as a bolt and

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:01.130 
be in the same shape as a as a bolt and
and<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.540> internal<00:01:56.659> ejector<00:01:57.659> pin<00:01:59.210> so<00:02:00.210> yeah

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
and the internal ejector pin so yeah

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.250 
and the internal ejector pin so yeah
that's<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.829> first<00:02:02.070> update
