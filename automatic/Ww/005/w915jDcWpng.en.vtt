00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:44.830 
hair perfectly and I think that's
extremely<00:01:43.490> important<00:01:44.330> when<00:01:44.420> you<00:01:44.539> get<00:01:44.660> like

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
extremely important when you get like

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.480 
extremely important when you get like
weeds<00:01:45.140> and<00:01:45.410> sew<00:01:45.590> ins<00:01:45.830> especially<00:01:46.250> when<00:01:46.399> you

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
weeds and sew ins especially when you

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.340 
weeds and sew ins especially when you
have<00:01:46.670> a<00:01:46.700> little<00:01:46.910> bit<00:01:47.090> of<00:01:47.119> leave<00:01:47.360> out<00:01:47.539> because

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
have a little bit of leave out because

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.620 
have a little bit of leave out because
obviously<00:01:48.649> people<00:01:49.220> don't<00:01:49.429> wear<00:01:49.580> weaves<00:01:49.940> just

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
obviously people don't wear weaves just

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.240 
obviously people don't wear weaves just
to<00:01:50.899> have<00:01:51.350> you<00:01:51.530> know<00:01:51.619> a<00:01:51.649> little<00:01:51.830> bit<00:01:51.979> of<00:01:52.039> extra

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
to have you know a little bit of extra

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.070 
to have you know a little bit of extra
one<00:01:52.640> but<00:01:52.850> you<00:01:52.970> wanted<00:01:53.210> to<00:01:53.360> look<00:01:53.479> a<00:01:53.660> little<00:01:53.840> bit

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
one but you wanted to look a little bit

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.560 
one but you wanted to look a little bit
realistic<00:01:54.500> so<00:01:55.160> I<00:01:55.429> love<00:01:56.000> that<00:01:56.300> the<00:01:56.420> hair

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
realistic so I love that the hair

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.810 
realistic so I love that the hair
texture<00:01:56.990> is<00:01:57.080> very<00:01:57.140> close<00:01:57.590> to<00:01:57.619> my<00:01:57.979> hair<00:01:58.250> texture

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
texture is very close to my hair texture

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.120 
texture is very close to my hair texture
so<00:01:59.300> if<00:01:59.360> you<00:01:59.479> do<00:01:59.630> have<00:01:59.830> african-american<00:02:00.830> here

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
so if you do have african-american here

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.490 
so if you do have african-american here
textured<00:02:01.700> relaxed<00:02:02.479> here<00:02:02.690> I'm<00:02:02.929> sorry<00:02:03.229> I<00:02:03.320> think

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
textured relaxed here I'm sorry I think

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.950 
textured relaxed here I'm sorry I think
of<00:02:03.679> it<00:02:03.890> should<00:02:04.520> have<00:02:04.610> specified<00:02:04.940> so<00:02:05.810> if<00:02:05.869> you

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
of it should have specified so if you

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.990 
of it should have specified so if you
have<00:02:06.130> african-american<00:02:07.130> relax<00:02:07.580> here<00:02:07.819> i<00:02:07.850> think

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
have african-american relax here i think

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.180 
have african-american relax here i think

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
that I think the company should have

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.590 
that I think the company should have
proven<00:03:09.920> when<00:03:10.670> it<00:03:10.790> comes<00:03:11.000> to<00:03:11.150> this<00:03:11.269> hair

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
proven when it comes to this hair

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.569 
proven when it comes to this hair

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579

the amount of shedding the shedding did

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.750 
the amount of shedding the shedding did
increase<00:03:28.750> um<00:03:29.170> throughout<00:03:29.770> time<00:03:30.130> and<00:03:30.190> like<00:03:30.640> i

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
increase um throughout time and like i

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.430 
increase um throughout time and like i
said<00:03:30.820> i<00:03:30.970> had<00:03:31.180> this<00:03:31.300> here<00:03:31.540> for<00:03:31.720> four<00:03:31.960> weeks<00:03:32.170> and

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
said i had this here for four weeks and

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.190 
said i had this here for four weeks and
it<00:03:32.860> does<00:03:33.070> shed<00:03:33.520> and<00:03:33.850> it<00:03:34.090> not<00:03:34.270> only<00:03:34.300> sheds<00:03:34.930> like

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
it does shed and it not only sheds like

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.800 
it does shed and it not only sheds like
long<00:03:35.500> pieces<00:03:35.920> but<00:03:36.280> it<00:03:36.400> also<00:03:36.640> sheds<00:03:37.120> short

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
long pieces but it also sheds short

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.770 
long pieces but it also sheds short
pieces<00:03:38.110> as<00:03:38.410> well<00:03:38.550> so<00:03:39.550> it<00:03:39.790> does<00:03:39.970> shed<00:03:40.360> quite<00:03:40.750> a

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
pieces as well so it does shed quite a

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.230 
pieces as well so it does shed quite a
bit<00:03:41.140> so<00:03:41.620> that's<00:03:42.010> one<00:03:42.190> of<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:42.400> cons<00:03:42.670> because

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
bit so that's one of the cons because

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.090 
bit so that's one of the cons because
obviously<00:03:43.600> i<00:03:44.290> don't<00:03:44.410> want<00:03:44.650> to<00:03:44.740> comb<00:03:44.920> my<00:03:44.950> hair

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.250 
obviously i don't want to comb my hair
and<00:03:45.430> then<00:03:45.520> have<00:03:45.820> a<00:03:45.850> lot<00:03:46.300> to<00:03:46.480> fear<00:03:46.720> coming<00:03:46.990> out

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
and then have a lot to fear coming out

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.100 
and then have a lot to fear coming out
of<00:03:47.290> the<00:03:47.650> comb<00:03:47.860> or<00:03:48.040> a<00:03:48.070> brush<00:03:48.160> when<00:03:49.000> I<00:03:49.030> comb<00:03:49.390> it<00:03:49.600> so

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
of the comb or a brush when I comb it so

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.720 
of the comb or a brush when I comb it so
that's<00:03:50.530> one<00:03:50.680> of<00:03:50.710> the<00:03:50.890> things<00:03:50.950> I<00:03:51.190> did<00:03:51.400> not<00:03:51.580> like

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
that's one of the things I did not like

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.580 
that's one of the things I did not like
about<00:03:51.760> this<00:03:52.150> year<00:03:52.420> second<00:03:53.020> thing<00:03:53.200> that<00:03:53.230> I<00:03:53.410> did

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
about this year second thing that I did

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.170 
about this year second thing that I did
not<00:03:53.650> like<00:03:53.980> about<00:03:54.010> this<00:03:54.430> here<00:03:54.760> was<00:03:55.000> the

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
not like about this here was the

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.240 
not like about this here was the
tangling<00:03:55.780> I<00:03:55.990> thought<00:03:56.230> that<00:03:56.470> of<00:03:56.680> course<00:03:56.920> I'm<00:03:57.160> on

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
tangling I thought that of course I'm on

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.240 
tangling I thought that of course I'm on
the<00:03:57.310> nape<00:03:57.580> area<00:03:57.850> we<00:03:58.780> tend<00:03:59.260> to<00:03:59.320> get<00:03:59.530> a<00:03:59.590> lot<00:03:59.980> of

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
the nape area we tend to get a lot of

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.460 
the nape area we tend to get a lot of
you<00:04:00.700> know<00:04:00.820> tangles<00:04:01.660> and<00:04:02.050> things<00:04:02.290> like<00:04:02.410> that

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
you know tangles and things like that

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.860 
you know tangles and things like that
but<00:04:03.160> it<00:04:03.280> also<00:04:03.520> tangled<00:04:04.150> like<00:04:04.270> on<00:04:04.420> the<00:04:04.600> sides

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
but it also tangled like on the sides

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.020 
but it also tangled like on the sides
and<00:04:05.320> things<00:04:05.620> like<00:04:05.770> that<00:04:05.830> so<00:04:06.280> it<00:04:06.430> was<00:04:06.550> hard<00:04:06.580> and

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
and things like that so it was hard and

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.390 
and things like that so it was hard and
it<00:04:07.090> was<00:04:07.240> like<00:04:07.420> naughty<00:04:07.720> so<00:04:08.470> that's<00:04:08.860> another

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
it was like naughty so that's another

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.949 
it was like naughty so that's another
thing<00:04:09.640> I<00:04:09.820> didn't<00:04:10.120> like<00:04:10.150> about<00:04:10.300> this<00:04:10.660> here

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
thing I didn't like about this here

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.710 
thing I didn't like about this here
because<00:04:11.290> it<00:04:11.440> really<00:04:11.620> did<00:04:11.920> tangled<00:04:12.520> easily<00:04:13.390> and

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
because it really did tangled easily and

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.420 
because it really did tangled easily and
I<00:04:13.810> know<00:04:13.870> that<00:04:14.110> it's<00:04:14.290> very<00:04:14.560> very<00:04:14.860> humid<00:04:15.280> outside

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
I know that it's very very humid outside

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.970 
I know that it's very very humid outside
so<00:04:16.000> that's<00:04:16.180> another<00:04:16.450> reason<00:04:16.690> probably<00:04:17.019> why<00:04:17.410> it

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
so that's another reason probably why it

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.009 
so that's another reason probably why it
was<00:04:18.250> really<00:04:18.549> really<00:04:18.700> tangled<00:04:19.090> but<00:04:19.690> it<00:04:19.810> did

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
was really really tangled but it did

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.599 
was really really tangled but it did
start<00:04:20.290> to<00:04:20.350> get<00:04:20.590> tangled<00:04:21.070> with<00:04:21.130> in<00:04:21.280> the<00:04:21.370> third

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
start to get tangled with in the third

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.430 
start to get tangled with in the third
or<00:04:21.760> fourth<00:04:22.000> week<00:04:22.030> of<00:04:22.360> wearing<00:04:22.750> gets<00:04:22.930> here<00:04:23.200> I

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
or fourth week of wearing gets here I

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.490 
or fourth week of wearing gets here I
think<00:04:23.919> that<00:04:24.100> I<00:04:24.130> kind<00:04:25.000> of<00:04:25.120> felt<00:04:25.390> if<00:04:25.870> you<00:04:26.230> about

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
think that I kind of felt if you about

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.250 
think that I kind of felt if you about
when<00:04:26.770> I<00:04:26.800> received<00:04:27.460> it<00:04:27.610> here<00:04:27.910> is<00:04:28.120> they<00:04:28.690> here<00:04:28.930> yet

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
know good but this hair was very very

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.550 
know good but this hair was very very
light<00:04:42.400> as<00:04:42.669> if<00:04:42.850> it<00:04:42.970> was<00:04:43.120> like<00:04:43.240> a<00:04:43.270> four<00:04:43.840> and<00:04:44.169> i'm

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
light as if it was like a four and i'm

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.490 
light as if it was like a four and i'm
very<00:04:44.700> far<00:04:45.700> off<00:04:45.940> of<00:04:45.970> the<00:04:46.330> four<00:04:46.630> i'm<00:04:46.810> a<00:04:46.930> one<00:04:47.200> be

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
very far off of the four i'm a one be

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.890 
very far off of the four i'm a one be
when<00:04:47.740> it<00:04:47.770> comes<00:04:48.040> to<00:04:48.190> hair<00:04:48.400> color<00:04:48.700> so<00:04:49.450> that's

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
when it comes to hair color so that's

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.480 
when it comes to hair color so that's
another<00:04:50.230> thing<00:04:50.500> that<00:04:50.650> i<00:04:50.710> had<00:04:50.919> to<00:04:51.070> go<00:04:51.220> and<00:04:51.370> do

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
another thing that i had to go and do

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:52.920 
another thing that i had to go and do
the<00:04:51.610> additional<00:04:52.120> step<00:04:52.360> because<00:04:52.630> i<00:04:52.720> usually

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
the additional step because i usually

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.820 
the additional step because i usually
don't<00:04:53.440> die<00:04:54.400> my<00:04:55.180> version<00:04:55.450> here<00:04:55.870> just<00:04:56.169> looks<00:04:56.410> so

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
don't die my version here just looks so

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.710 
don't die my version here just looks so
close<00:04:57.070> to<00:04:57.310> one<00:04:57.520> beat<00:04:57.730> so<00:04:58.000> i<00:04:58.030> just<00:04:58.300> leave<00:04:58.540> it

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
close to one beat so i just leave it

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.930 
close to one beat so i just leave it
like

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
like

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.500 
like
that<00:04:59.060> so<00:04:59.390> just<00:04:59.870> doing<00:05:00.170> the<00:05:00.260> extra<00:05:00.530> step

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
that so just doing the extra step

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.300 
that so just doing the extra step
definitely<00:05:02.510> was<00:05:03.050> something<00:05:03.410> I<00:05:03.500> didn't<00:05:03.920> enjoy

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
definitely was something I didn't enjoy

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.250 
definitely was something I didn't enjoy
but<00:05:04.610> that's<00:05:04.790> just<00:05:04.970> my<00:05:05.270> preference<00:05:05.660> it's<00:05:06.140> not

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
but that's just my preference it's not

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.630 
but that's just my preference it's not
going<00:05:06.380> to<00:05:06.470> do<00:05:06.590> with<00:05:06.740> the<00:05:06.860> company<00:05:07.250> your<00:05:07.430> hair

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:07.640 
going to do with the company your hair

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.360 
going to do with the company your hair

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
your hair in conclusion if for the price

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.550 
your hair in conclusion if for the price
of<00:05:13.730> this<00:05:14.090> hair<00:05:14.390> I<00:05:14.420> definitely<00:05:15.110> will<00:05:15.530> recommend

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
of this hair I definitely will recommend

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.190 
of this hair I definitely will recommend
getting<00:05:16.550> it<00:05:16.880> for<00:05:17.150> the<00:05:17.360> price<00:05:17.570> because<00:05:18.080> the

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 
getting it for the price because the

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.560 
getting it for the price because the
price<00:05:18.470> is<00:05:18.500> extremely<00:05:19.370> affordable<00:05:19.700> and<00:05:20.180> I

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
price is extremely affordable and I

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.180 
price is extremely affordable and I
think<00:05:20.780> the<00:05:20.900> hair<00:05:21.080> texture<00:05:21.500> is<00:05:21.620> good<00:05:21.920> if<00:05:22.100> you

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
think the hair texture is good if you

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.220 
think the hair texture is good if you
keep<00:05:22.430> up<00:05:22.610> washing<00:05:22.880> it<00:05:23.510> and<00:05:23.570> things<00:05:24.020> like<00:05:24.170> that

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.230 
keep up washing it and things like that

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.560 
keep up washing it and things like that

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350 
trying to splurge on a nice care virgin

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.830 
trying to splurge on a nice care virgin
here<00:05:30.620> that<00:05:30.830> doesn't<00:05:31.010> tangle<00:05:31.430> as<00:05:32.000> much<00:05:32.300> for

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
here that doesn't tangle as much for

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.900 
here that doesn't tangle as much for
shedding<00:05:33.140> no<00:05:33.680> I<00:05:33.710> will<00:05:34.010> not<00:05:34.040> recommend<00:05:34.610> this

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
shedding no I will not recommend this

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.090 
shedding no I will not recommend this
here<00:05:35.390> but<00:05:35.810> if<00:05:35.900> you're<00:05:36.050> on<00:05:36.200> a<00:05:36.230> tight<00:05:36.560> budget<00:05:36.590> I

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.100 
here but if you're on a tight budget I

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.670 
here but if you're on a tight budget I
definitely<00:05:37.460> think<00:05:37.850> it<00:05:38.120> is<00:05:38.330> worth<00:05:38.660> it<00:05:38.900> for<00:05:39.260> the

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
definitely think it is worth it for the

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.220 
definitely think it is worth it for the
price<00:05:39.860> that<00:05:40.010> they<00:05:40.400> sell<00:05:40.700> it<00:05:40.820> for<00:05:41.120> and<00:05:41.360> the<00:05:41.960> pros

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:42.230 
price that they sell it for and the pros

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.470 
price that they sell it for and the pros
and<00:05:42.260> cons<00:05:42.710> the<00:05:43.100> versus<00:05:43.460> the<00:05:43.580> pros<00:05:43.790> and<00:05:43.970> cons<00:05:44.180> so

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:44.480 
and cons the versus the pros and cons so

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.410 
and cons the versus the pros and cons so
I<00:05:44.690> definitely<00:05:45.110> think<00:05:45.710> that<00:05:45.890> if<00:05:46.790> you<00:05:47.060> don't

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:47.420 
I definitely think that if you don't

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.240 
I definitely think that if you don't
want<00:05:47.690> to<00:05:47.840> spend<00:05:48.230> that<00:05:48.440> much<00:05:48.620> money<00:05:48.650> but<00:05:49.190> you

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
want to spend that much money but you

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.580 
want to spend that much money but you
want<00:05:49.550> okay<00:05:50.030> here<00:05:50.630> then<00:05:51.110> I<00:05:51.230> would<00:05:51.290> definitely

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
want okay here then I would definitely

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.360 
want okay here then I would definitely
buy<00:05:52.220> this<00:05:52.940> point
