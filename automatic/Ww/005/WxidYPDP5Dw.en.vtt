pretty<00:00:27.210> simple<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:28.260> I'm<00:00:28.349> just<00:00:28.439> going<00:00:28.560> to

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619

pretty simple so I'm just going to
demonstrate<00:00:28.769> how<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.160> works<00:00:29.369> you<00:00:29.699> drop<00:00:29.939> an

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
demonstrate how it works you drop an

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.970 
demonstrate how it works you drop an
item<00:00:30.150> he<00:00:30.539> touches<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.019> pressure<00:00:31.230> plate<00:00:31.470> it

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
item he touches the pressure plate it

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.709 
item he touches the pressure plate it
activates<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:32.880> gets<00:00:33.059> cleared<00:00:33.420> like

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
activates it and you gets cleared like

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.170 
activates it and you gets cleared like
that<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.500> can<00:00:34.620> have<00:00:34.739> as<00:00:34.890> many<00:00:35.010> items<00:00:35.280> now<00:00:36.120> you

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
that you can have as many items now you

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.670 
that you can have as many items now you
can<00:00:36.329> throw<00:00:36.510> us<00:00:36.630> many<00:00:36.809> I<00:00:37.079> never<00:00:37.320> see<00:00:37.469> just

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
can throw us many I never see just

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.430 
can throw us many I never see just
doesn't<00:00:38.190> get<00:00:38.309> jammed<00:00:38.780> it<00:00:39.780> only<00:00:39.899> gets<00:00:40.170> jammed

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
doesn't get jammed it only gets jammed

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.200 
doesn't get jammed it only gets jammed
when<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.770> throw<00:00:40.980> items<00:00:41.160> on<00:00:41.460> this<00:00:41.610> block<00:00:41.910> over

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
when you throw items on this block over

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.420 
when you throw items on this block over
here<00:00:42.450> but<00:00:43.290> there<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.559> way<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.860> fix<00:00:44.219> that

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
here but there is a way to fix that

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.790 
here but there is a way to fix that
which<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:44.879> pretty<00:00:45.090> much<00:00:45.300> just<00:00:45.629> covering<00:00:46.590> it

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
which is pretty much just covering it

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.639 
which is pretty much just covering it
like<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.450> so<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.780> know<00:00:48.870> if<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.230> only<00:00:49.410> want

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
like this so you know if you only want

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.580 
like this so you know if you only want
it<00:00:50.570> maybe<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.719> just<00:00:51.780> want<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.320> be<00:00:52.410> like

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
it maybe you just want it to be like

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.260 
it maybe you just want it to be like
that<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.129> can't<00:00:53.489> really<00:00:53.550> drop<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.059> on<00:00:54.149> this

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
that so you can't really drop it on this

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.369 
that so you can't really drop it on this
blog<00:00:54.539> or<00:00:54.780> something<00:00:56.660> and<00:00:57.660> then<00:00:57.899> all<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.050> item

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
blog or something and then all the item

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.189 
blog or something and then all the item
to<00:00:58.469> drop<00:00:58.829> would<00:00:59.039> always<00:00:59.550> get<00:00:59.699> clears<00:01:00.199> weird

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
to drop would always get clears weird

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.469 
to drop would always get clears weird
like<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:02.280> yeah<00:01:03.110> it's<00:01:04.110> pretty<00:01:04.229> simple<00:01:05.479> so

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
like that so yeah it's pretty simple so

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.310 
like that so yeah it's pretty simple so
now<00:01:06.570> I'm<00:01:06.630> just<00:01:06.720> going<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.930> show<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.170> how<00:01:07.200> to

want<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.990> put<00:01:25.110> your<00:01:25.200> wood<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.530> pressure<00:01:25.740> plate

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
want to put your wood and pressure plate

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.090 
want to put your wood and pressure plate
over<00:01:26.220> here<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:27.229> then<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.710> need<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.890> way<00:01:29.070> to

over here and then you need a way to

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.670 
over here and then you need a way to
clear<00:01:29.640> this<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.270> what<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.780> want<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.229> do<00:01:31.350> is

clear this so what you want to do is

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.830 
clear this so what you want to do is
break<00:01:32.430> two<00:01:33.000> blocks<00:01:33.329> like<00:01:33.570> this<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:34.579> another

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
break two blocks like this and another

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.109 
break two blocks like this and another
source<00:01:36.840> right<00:01:37.290> here<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:38.159> that's<00:01:38.909> pretty<00:01:39.000> much
