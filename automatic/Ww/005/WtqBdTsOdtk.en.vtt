CS<00:02:56.209> topic<00:02:56.660> CS<00:02:56.959> 18<00:02:57.319> and<00:02:57.530> you<00:02:58.069> can<00:02:58.250> see<00:02:58.550> that<00:02:58.760> yeah

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
CS topic CS 18 and you can see that yeah

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.479 
CS topic CS 18 and you can see that yeah
that's<00:02:59.900> just<00:02:59.959> great<00:03:00.500> thing<00:03:00.680> over<00:03:00.980> there<00:03:01.160> and

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
that's just great thing over there and

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:14.470 
that's just great thing over there and
that's<00:03:02.299> where<00:03:02.599> the<00:03:02.870> correct<00:03:03.760> area<00:03:13.269> what<00:03:14.269> you

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
that's where the correct area what you

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.910 
that's where the correct area what you
think<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:15.470> extra<00:03:15.940> $20<00:03:17.200> for<00:03:18.200> is<00:03:18.380> actually<00:03:18.590> just

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
think the extra $20 for is actually just

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:27.750 
think the extra $20 for is actually just
a<00:03:19.160> stone

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.600 

by<00:03:28.560> pushing<00:03:29.560> this<00:03:29.830> button<00:03:29.890> down<00:03:30.310> and<00:03:30.489> then

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
by pushing this button down and then

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.149 
by pushing this button down and then
sliding<00:03:30.939> it<00:03:31.090> backwards<00:03:31.720> quite<00:03:32.620> a<00:03:32.650> tight<00:03:32.890> fit

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:33.159 
sliding it backwards quite a tight fit

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:37.170 
sliding it backwards quite a tight fit
so<00:03:33.730> take<00:03:34.390> note<00:03:34.569> of<00:03:34.599> that<00:03:34.720> and<00:03:35.140> then<00:03:35.709> to<00:03:36.060> for<00:03:37.060> the

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
so take note of that and then to for the

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.460 
so take note of that and then to for the
stop<00:03:37.390> you<00:03:37.540> pull<00:03:37.780> it<00:03:37.870> backwards

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
stop you pull it backwards

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.380 
stop you pull it backwards
push<00:03:38.950> it<00:03:39.129> forward<00:03:39.159> swing<00:03:39.700> it<00:03:39.819> forward<00:03:40.060> and

push it forward swing it forward and
then<00:03:40.540> push<00:03:41.230> it<00:03:41.379> backwards<00:03:41.590> like<00:03:42.010> that<00:03:46.409> your
