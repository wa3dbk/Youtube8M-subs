when Honda originally designed the new

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.500 
when Honda originally designed the new
Civic<00:00:02.340> they<00:00:02.490> never<00:00:02.700> intended<00:00:03.030> to<00:00:03.270> make<00:00:03.449> a

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
Civic they never intended to make a

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.570 
Civic they never intended to make a
roomier<00:00:03.959> estate<00:00:04.380> model<00:00:04.710> but<00:00:05.160> here<00:00:05.400> we<00:00:05.549> are

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
roomier estate model but here we are

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.579 
roomier estate model but here we are
with<00:00:05.879> a<00:00:05.910> pre-production<00:00:06.600> prototype<00:00:07.109> of<00:00:07.379> the

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
with a pre-production prototype of the

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.230 
with a pre-production prototype of the
new<00:00:07.620> Civic<00:00:08.160> tourer<00:00:08.490> which<00:00:08.760> is<00:00:08.880> set<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.090> be

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
new Civic tourer which is set to be

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.780 
new Civic tourer which is set to be
unveiled<00:00:09.269> at<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:09.780> Frankfurt<00:00:10.200> Motor<00:00:10.260> Show

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:10.790 
unveiled at the Frankfurt Motor Show

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.890 
unveiled at the Frankfurt Motor Show
basically<00:00:11.790> it's<00:00:11.969> been<00:00:12.150> engineered<00:00:12.570> and

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
basically it's been engineered and

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.660 
basically it's been engineered and
designed<00:00:12.929> by<00:00:13.440> Honda<00:00:13.980> Europe<00:00:14.340> so<00:00:14.490> it's<00:00:14.549> a

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
designed by Honda Europe so it's a

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.400 
designed by Honda Europe so it's a
chance<00:00:14.880> for<00:00:15.000> them<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.299> show<00:00:15.690> Japan<00:00:16.049> what<00:00:16.320> it

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
chance for them to show Japan what it

chance for them to show Japan what it
can<00:00:16.560> do

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
can do

we're here to find out about some of the

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.060 
we're here to find out about some of the
new<00:00:18.750> technologies<00:00:19.350> involved<00:00:19.740> including

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
new technologies involved including

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.859 
new technologies involved including
adaptive<00:00:20.520> suspension<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:21.330> take<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.539> closer

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
adaptive suspension and take a closer

adaptive suspension and take a closer
look<00:00:22.109> at<00:00:22.260> how<00:00:22.380> it's<00:00:22.560> shaping<00:00:22.740> up<00:00:26.000> Honda<00:00:27.000> won't

look at how it's shaping up Honda won't

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.759 
look at how it's shaping up Honda won't
give<00:00:27.449> us<00:00:27.539> an<00:00:27.630> exact<00:00:27.990> figure<00:00:28.170> for<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.470> size<00:00:28.680> of

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
give us an exact figure for the size of

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.200 
give us an exact figure for the size of
the<00:00:28.859> boot<00:00:29.039> yet<00:00:29.279> but<00:00:29.460> they<00:00:29.519> are<00:00:29.760> saying<00:00:30.060> it's

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
the boot yet but they are saying it's

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.510 
the boot yet but they are saying it's
gonna<00:00:30.330> be<00:00:30.390> over<00:00:30.779> 600<00:00:31.080> liters<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:32.009> that<00:00:32.279> should

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
gonna be over 600 liters and that should

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.280 
gonna be over 600 liters and that should
be<00:00:32.610> class<00:00:32.850> leading<00:00:33.120> they've<00:00:33.660> also<00:00:33.899> raised<00:00:34.170> the

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
be class leading they've also raised the

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.690 
be class leading they've also raised the
boot<00:00:34.500> floor<00:00:34.710> slightly<00:00:35.250> compared<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.610> the

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
boot floor slightly compared to the

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.370 
boot floor slightly compared to the
five-door<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:36.570> there's<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.809> completely<00:00:37.230> flat

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
five-door so there's a completely flat

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.229 
five-door so there's a completely flat
loading<00:00:37.710> bay<00:00:37.950> wants<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.280> see<00:00:38.399> stuff<00:00:38.579> older<00:00:38.879> and

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
loading bay wants to see stuff older and

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.170 
loading bay wants to see stuff older and
like<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.379> five-door<00:00:40.829> with<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.730> couple<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.030> easy

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
like the five-door with a couple of easy

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.000 
like the five-door with a couple of easy
movers<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.780> can<00:00:42.899> flip<00:00:43.140> up<00:00:43.260> these<00:00:43.379> seat<00:00:43.649> faces

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
movers you can flip up these seat faces

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.250 
movers you can flip up these seat faces
it's<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.760> lot<00:00:45.000> easier<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.420> carry<00:00:45.570> tool<00:00:45.899> items

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
it's a lot easier to carry tool items

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.500 
it's a lot easier to carry tool items
here<00:00:46.860> in<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.039> back<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:48.149> should<00:00:48.300> give<00:00:48.420> it

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
here in the back and that should give it

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.000 
here in the back and that should give it
a<00:00:48.570> distinct<00:00:48.930> advantage<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.500> more

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
a distinct advantage of more

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.860 
a distinct advantage of more
conventional<00:00:50.219> rivals<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.539> Skoda<00:00:51.780> Octavia

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
conventional rivals the Skoda Octavia

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.950 
conventional rivals the Skoda Octavia
state<00:00:52.820> focus<00:00:53.820> takes<00:00:56.239> the<00:00:57.239> news<00:00:57.420> gets<00:00:57.660> even

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
state focus takes the news gets even

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.119 
state focus takes the news gets even
better<00:00:58.079> when<00:00:58.320> you're<00:00:58.469> sat<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.800> back<00:00:58.980> as

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
better when you're sat in the back as

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.010 
better when you're sat in the back as
well<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.910> longer<00:01:00.149> roofline<00:01:00.690> means<00:01:00.930> that

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
well this longer roofline means that

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.029 
well this longer roofline means that
there's<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.230> lot<00:01:01.260> more<00:01:01.500> Headroom<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:01.949> there

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
there's a lot more Headroom in there

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.619 
there's a lot more Headroom in there
isn't<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.309> five-door<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:02.940> as<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.359> can<00:01:03.480> see

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
isn't the five-door and as you can see

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.479 
isn't the five-door and as you can see
I'm<00:01:03.780> 5<00:01:04.019> foot<00:01:04.170> 11<00:01:04.229> I've<00:01:04.860> got<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.070> couple<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.339> extra

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
I'm 5 foot 11 I've got a couple of extra

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.700 
I'm 5 foot 11 I've got a couple of extra
inches<00:01:05.939> whereas<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.780> headline<00:01:07.320> was<00:01:07.530> always

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
inches whereas the headline was always

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.080 
inches whereas the headline was always
resting<00:01:08.159> on<00:01:08.250> my<00:01:08.340> head<00:01:08.490> slightly<00:01:08.729> more<00:01:08.970> than<00:01:09.000> a

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
resting on my head slightly more than a

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.300 
resting on my head slightly more than a
5-door<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.710> unlike<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.799> five-door<00:01:11.130> there's

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
5-door and unlike the five-door there's

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.859 
5-door and unlike the five-door there's
no<00:01:11.400> spoiler<00:01:11.820> across<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.150> rear<00:01:12.330> screen<00:01:12.630> so<00:01:12.780> the

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
no spoiler across the rear screen so the

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.270 
no spoiler across the rear screen so the
visibility<00:01:13.229> is<00:01:13.470> improved<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.890> lot<00:01:14.010> too

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
visibility is improved a lot too

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.859 
visibility is improved a lot too
although<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.880> seat<00:01:15.090> fillers<00:01:15.240> are<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.659> bit

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
although the seat fillers are a bit

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.270 
although the seat fillers are a bit
thick<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.409> do<00:01:16.530> notice<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.890> coming<00:01:17.250> out

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
thick and you do notice that coming out

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.710 
thick and you do notice that coming out
of<00:01:17.340> junctions

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.940 

so<00:01:23.720> today<00:01:24.020> we've<00:01:24.290> been<00:01:24.410> given<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:24.650> chance<00:01:24.830> to

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
so today we've been given the chance to

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.470 
so today we've been given the chance to
drive<00:01:25.130> two<00:01:25.430> different<00:01:25.790> versions<00:01:25.970> of<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.300> new

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 
drive two different versions of the new

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.180 
drive two different versions of the new
Honda<00:01:26.690> Civic<00:01:27.080> tourer<00:01:27.380> they're<00:01:27.830> both<00:01:27.980> come

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
Honda Civic tourer they're both come

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.760 
Honda Civic tourer they're both come
with<00:01:28.220> a<00:01:28.400> 1.6<00:01:28.850> liter<00:01:29.120> DTEC<00:01:29.630> engine<00:01:30.050> which<00:01:30.560> at

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
with a 1.6 liter DTEC engine which at

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:31.870 
with a 1.6 liter DTEC engine which at
the<00:01:30.860> moment<00:01:30.890> they're<00:01:31.250> not<00:01:31.280> telling<00:01:31.640> us<00:01:31.700> how

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
the moment they're not telling us how

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.180 
the moment they're not telling us how
efficient<00:01:32.270> it<00:01:32.330> is<00:01:32.360> but<00:01:33.020> I'm<00:01:33.560> sitting<00:01:33.830> in<00:01:33.980> now

I'm<00:02:17.150> honest<00:02:17.420> you<00:02:17.600> do<00:02:17.750> feel<00:02:18.020> it<00:02:18.080> stiffen<00:02:18.950> up

I'm honest you do feel it stiffen up
slightly<00:02:19.520> but<00:02:19.730> it's<00:02:19.850> doesn't<00:02:20.570> transform<00:02:21.170> into

slightly but it's doesn't transform into

slightly but it's doesn't transform into
a<00:02:21.440> sports<00:02:21.740> car<00:02:22.040> it<00:02:22.130> just<00:02:22.160> gives<00:02:22.459> you<00:02:22.490> a<00:02:22.580> bit

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
a sports car it just gives you a bit

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.449 
a sports car it just gives you a bit
more<00:02:22.760> choice<00:02:23.240> but<00:02:23.959> a<00:02:24.200> Honda<00:02:25.010> is<00:02:25.100> saying<00:02:25.310> that

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
more choice but a Honda is saying that

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:26.860 
more choice but a Honda is saying that

they're not too keen for us to talk much
about<00:02:43.410> interior<00:02:43.770> trim<00:02:44.190> or<00:02:44.340> anything<00:02:44.490> like

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
that but I can tell you is that the 2.2

that but I can tell you is that the 2.2
litre<00:02:47.040> deal<00:02:47.190> is<00:02:47.400> probably<00:02:47.940> going<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.180> be

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
litre deal is probably going to be

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.370 
litre deal is probably going to be
dropped<00:02:48.570> so<00:02:49.410> only<00:02:49.890> be<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.130> 2026<00:02:50.700> from<00:02:50.850> now<00:02:50.970> on

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
dropped so only be the 2026 from now on

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.410 
dropped so only be the 2026 from now on
the<00:02:52.380> engine<00:02:52.680> they've<00:02:52.860> got<00:02:53.040> molesters<00:02:53.460> so<00:02:54.120> it's

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
the engine they've got molesters so it's

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.880 
the engine they've got molesters so it's
smooth<00:02:54.660> and<00:02:54.840> it<00:02:54.930> read<00:02:55.080> very<00:02:55.320> cleanly<00:02:55.620> it's

intrude a little bit on the cabin so

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.530 
intrude a little bit on the cabin so
it's<00:03:02.160> not<00:03:02.280> perfect<00:03:02.790> but<00:03:02.940> I<00:03:03.000> have<00:03:03.210> to<00:03:03.300> say<00:03:03.420> the

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
it's not perfect but I have to say the

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.270 
it's not perfect but I have to say the
NVH<00:03:03.840> in<00:03:04.020> this<00:03:04.200> car<00:03:04.440> is<00:03:04.620> a<00:03:04.650> lot<00:03:04.830> better<00:03:05.010> than<00:03:05.100> the

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
NVH in this car is a lot better than the

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.180 
NVH in this car is a lot better than the
CRV<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.510> off-road<00:03:06.990> car<00:03:07.230> with<00:03:07.380> a<00:03:07.410> 1.6<00:03:07.860> as<00:03:08.010> well

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
CRV the off-road car with a 1.6 as well

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.470 
CRV the off-road car with a 1.6 as well
somehow<00:03:08.430> they<00:03:08.610> just<00:03:08.670> managed<00:03:08.970> to<00:03:09.000> keep<00:03:09.180> it<00:03:09.330> lit

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
somehow they just managed to keep it lit

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.790 
somehow they just managed to keep it lit
quieter<00:03:09.900> in<00:03:09.960> the<00:03:10.020> Civic<00:03:10.290> which<00:03:10.440> is<00:03:10.560> good

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800

about<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.110> boot<00:03:13.290> space<00:03:13.530> but<00:03:13.800> what<00:03:13.890> I<00:03:13.950> can<00:03:14.130> tell

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
about the boot space but what I can tell

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.760 
about the boot space but what I can tell
you<00:03:14.370> is<00:03:14.550> that<00:03:14.730> this<00:03:15.480> estate<00:03:16.290> model<00:03:16.560> has<00:03:16.740> a

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
you is that this estate model has a

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.620 
you is that this estate model has a

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
different set set up for the springs the

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.720

dampers and the steering and even in the
car<00:03:20.910> without<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.300> adaptive<00:03:21.660> system<00:03:21.810> it<00:03:22.170> feels

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
car without the adaptive system it feels

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.320 
car without the adaptive system it feels
a<00:03:22.680> lot<00:03:22.920> better<00:03:23.070> to<00:03:23.280> drive<00:03:23.520> the<00:03:23.910> weighting<00:03:24.270> on

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
a lot better to drive the weighting on

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.850 
a lot better to drive the weighting on
steering<00:03:24.660> is<00:03:24.780> much<00:03:24.900> more<00:03:25.050> consistent<00:03:25.380> I<00:03:25.710> want

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
steering is much more consistent I want

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.770 
steering is much more consistent I want

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140

we did find today this normal setup just
feels<00:03:44.670> quite<00:03:44.820> nice<00:03:45.030> controlled<00:03:45.600> but

feels quite nice controlled but

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:53.180 
feels quite nice controlled but
comfortable<00:03:46.830> which<00:03:47.340> is<00:03:47.490> 100<00:03:51.920> so<00:03:52.920> there<00:03:53.100> you

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
comfortable which is 100 so there you

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.600 
comfortable which is 100 so there you
have<00:03:53.340> it

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.150 
personally think that the Civic tourer
is<00:03:57.720> shaping<00:03:57.930> up<00:03:58.080> really<00:03:58.470> nicely<00:03:58.680> indeed
