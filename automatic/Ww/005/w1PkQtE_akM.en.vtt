java<00:01:14.299> application<00:01:15.880> asking<00:01:16.880> about<00:01:17.060> your

previous experience traits that would

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.679 
previous experience traits that would
make<00:01:20.420> you<00:01:20.600> qualified<00:01:20.869> and<00:01:22.420> they<00:01:23.420> didn't

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
make you qualified and they didn't

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.109 
make you qualified and they didn't
really<00:01:23.780> look<00:01:23.990> for<00:01:24.259> much<00:01:24.579> previous<00:01:25.579> experience

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
really look for much previous experience

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.639 
really look for much previous experience
just<00:01:26.810> more<00:01:27.140> so<00:01:27.619> if<00:01:28.310> you<00:01:28.790> had<00:01:29.030> the<00:01:29.329> energy<00:01:29.899> and

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
just more so if you had the energy and

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:33.029 
just more so if you had the energy and
drive<00:01:30.950> to<00:01:31.310> work<00:01:31.430> in<00:01:31.610> a<00:01:31.670> place<00:01:31.880> like<00:01:32.030> in<00:01:32.360> and<00:01:32.540> out

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
drive to work in a place like in and out

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:35.289 
drive to work in a place like in and out
because<00:01:34.039> most<00:01:34.460> of<00:01:34.579> the<00:01:34.670> people<00:01:34.820> that<00:01:35.119> work

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
because most of the people that work

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:37.810 
because most of the people that work
there<00:01:35.329> that<00:01:35.960> was<00:01:36.530> their<00:01:36.799> first<00:01:37.219> job<00:01:37.460> as<00:01:37.640> well

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
there that was their first job as well

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.870 
there that was their first job as well
so<00:01:38.229> but<00:01:39.229> they<00:01:39.439> definitely<00:01:39.649> got<00:01:40.219> you<00:01:40.399> prepared

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
so but they definitely got you prepared

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.990 
so but they definitely got you prepared
for<00:01:41.299> the<00:01:41.479> job

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
for the job

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.639 
for the job
what<00:01:44.000> set<00:01:44.240> you<00:01:44.270> apart<00:01:44.689> from<00:01:44.780> other<00:01:45.079> candidates

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:51.660 

what<00:01:48.649> might<00:01:48.890> have<00:01:49.009> set<00:01:49.219> me<00:01:49.399> apart<00:01:49.700> is<00:01:49.939> I<00:01:50.270> was

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
what might have set me apart is I was

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.029 
what might have set me apart is I was
highly<00:01:52.670> active<00:01:53.240> in<00:01:53.930> sports<00:01:54.320> during<00:01:54.829> high

highly active in sports during high

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:57.069 
highly active in sports during high
school<00:01:55.100> and<00:01:55.340> that<00:01:55.729> might<00:01:56.030> have<00:01:56.180> attributed<00:01:56.930> to

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
school and that might have attributed to

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:00.279 
school and that might have attributed to
me<00:01:57.350> always<00:01:58.009> being<00:01:58.430> on<00:01:58.670> top<00:01:58.909> of<00:01:59.090> things<00:01:59.289> being
