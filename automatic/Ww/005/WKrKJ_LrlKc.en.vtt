00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.279
 hello everyone here I tell you the drama 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.730
 with my tablet 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:16.849
 this is a samsung galaxytab 4 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:20.050
 with wifi and chips that is the problem 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:23.080
 as many people do 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.519
 that does not grab me the wifi pressure and neither 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.820
 It is not active and not only the wifi 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:29.470
 but also the bluetooth 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.119
 as wi-fi 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.630
 in the few seconds it turns to 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:33.630
 deactivate 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.949
 the same happens with the bluetooth saw 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.080
 does not hold either 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.290
 I have searched in all possible ways 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.270
 but nothing 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:01:00.399
 I can not find a solution to a restart of 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:01.870
 factory I put the sdl they pulled that no 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:05.059
 he liked it was not even using 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:08.810
 sd but I tried to put it out 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.670
 also the good software that I 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.520
 they did the truth I do not know what software 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.299
 they put in but 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.299
 neither 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.150
 I put in advanced 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.790
 manga address seems by ip address 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.070
 says not available 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.990
 we continue to do 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.810
 and I know that this happens to many 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.790
 some with other types of tablets to me 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.470
 with this I do not know how complicated 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.620
 be the thing 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.990
 but so I do not know if I'm a root user 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.720
 what will the system change 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.480
 operative I see that I have your browser and that 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.820
 can help me for something because they try 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.310
 to fix myself I want to know if it has 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.760
 some solution because if it did not touch me 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.340
 take it 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.250
 to a place where they charge me triple the 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.710
 what usually costs more he was going 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.980
 Of course they are accurate to fix 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.870
 but yes it costs that then I want 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.810
 see if anyone knows how I can 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.340
 solve this what stays long I 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.650
 happens 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.650
 the truth that is not coming this afternoon 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.890
 I say goodbye and I hope you comment and 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.000
 appear some solution 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.000
 Because until now 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.510
 scoured the thing 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.430
 see you later
