00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 on 8 there are different factors 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.690
 make your computer slower 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.840
 so many programs open at the same time 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.820
 too little ram and of course tons of 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.880
 duplicates of files yours 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.949
 eat hard disk space around it 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.240
 you should first open all 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.090
 Programs do not close their programs 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.740
 It takes many people leave their way 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.960
 constantly running so that it is quite 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.189
 he can be useful on a regular basis 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.710
 to restart 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.140
 some programs occupy even if you 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.059
 you still have memory left only 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.579
 a restart of the computer sets this 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.960
 memory then free again around the 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.910
 you need to delete duplicates 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.750
 definitely a program that will give you this 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.700
 work decreases 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.739
 thinking you once about that set it apart from 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.710
 to make the software I do 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.350
 use is called heidi ab claudia price 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.059
 German as much as rooms on that is 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.899
 the best duplicate finder for mac den 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.210
 I could find 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.129
 he is the fastest with the most 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.780
 functions and also easy too 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.600
 serve 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:04.710
 You can get it from www.laetta.com 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.360
 Download and first something 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.380
 limited free version 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.320
 try out 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.670
 this is what the program looks like after the start 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.040
 to search for duplicates 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.500
 you just have to do the places 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.000
 select where to search 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.340
 that can be certain folders or 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.350
 hard drives are also network 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.409
 drives the program even searches 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.310
 iphoto itunes apertura and mail 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.369
 databases 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.950

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.240
 set search criteria 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.159
 pretty much everything 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.430
 can adjust what a search 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.740
 is conceivable 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.570
 I'll show you as an example like me

 looking for duplicate photos 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.830
 the result of the search will be in one 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.750
 new window showed that about how 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.390
 This looks like this 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.280
 The program is very special 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.800
 easy to find the information 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.810
 you can view one object 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.209
 quick preview and the exact path 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.410
 to draw this object with the info 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.480
 button you get even more 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.069
 information and a complete 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.510
 preview of the object 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.940
 you can objects that you 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.530
 Continue to work by hand in one volt 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.360
 pull easy collect basket 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.069
 But parts from offers also one 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.050
 Automatic basket with the man 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.319
 the objects you continue to work on 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.780
 want 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.970
 can manage even more practical if 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.100
 For example, you do not care where the 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.050
 you can find found documents 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.630
 simply delete all objects in the

 to collect objects 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.230
 then an option window will open in 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.650

 for example , only the oldest hire 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.519
 of all found duplicate pictures in the 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.989
 to collect collection basket 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.700
 as soon as your collection place is finished and 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.560
 contains only the desired objects 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.840
 can you delete these objects 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.540
 move or copy as 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.970
 save a backup or a cd 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.010
 or dvd burn the list of 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.819
 secure found objects or the 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:35.750
 objects by alias replace no fear 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:38.549
 because the apa is a very safe extinguishing system 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.260
 as long as the recycle bin of mco asics 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.450
 The program can not be taught 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.100
 easily provide all perhaps 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.200
 Restore deleted objects
