this lifetime
who<00:02:46.660> speaks<00:02:46.840> our<00:02:47.080> language<00:02:47.110> and<00:02:47.620> lives<00:02:47.800> on<00:02:47.920> our

continent<00:02:48.550> you<00:02:48.790> know<00:02:49.170> that<00:02:50.170> just<00:02:50.410> doesn't

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
continent you know that just doesn't

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.250 
continent you know that just doesn't
seem<00:02:51.010> workable<00:02:51.910> in<00:02:52.150> a<00:02:52.300> scenario<00:02:52.570> so<00:02:53.230> you

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
seem workable in a scenario so you

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.560 
seem workable in a scenario so you
couldn't<00:02:53.770> take<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:54.070> case<00:02:54.250> that<00:02:54.910> there's<00:02:55.390> no

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
couldn't take the case that there's no

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.150 
couldn't take the case that there's no
soul<00:02:55.810> mate<00:02:55.930> so<00:02:56.110> what<00:02:56.230> that<00:02:56.320> allows<00:02:56.440> for<00:02:56.890> you<00:02:57.010> to

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
soul mate so what that allows for you to

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.280 
soul mate so what that allows for you to
do<00:02:57.310> is<00:02:57.580> you<00:02:58.180> could<00:02:58.390> look<00:02:58.510> back<00:02:58.720> at<00:02:58.900> your<00:02:59.050> past

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
do is you could look back at your past

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.770 
do is you could look back at your past
relationship<00:02:59.980> and<00:03:00.220> wasn't<00:03:01.090> your<00:03:01.360> soul<00:03:01.600> mate

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
relationship and wasn't your soul mate

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.430 
relationship and wasn't your soul mate
so<00:03:02.260> there's<00:03:02.920> not<00:03:03.070> a<00:03:03.310> whole<00:03:03.580> lot<00:03:04.300> more<00:03:04.660> baggage

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
so there's not a whole lot more baggage

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.080 
so there's not a whole lot more baggage
or<00:03:05.890> a<00:03:05.920> lot<00:03:06.070> more<00:03:06.310> hurt<00:03:06.550> that<00:03:06.730> comes<00:03:06.850> with<00:03:07.060> that

or a lot more hurt that comes with that

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.060
