00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
when it comes to avoiding blisters I

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:12.890 
when it comes to avoiding blisters I
always<00:00:12.090> find<00:00:12.240> that<00:00:12.300> prevention<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:12.840> better

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
always find that prevention is better

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.470 
always find that prevention is better
than<00:00:13.140> cure<00:00:13.260> I<00:00:13.820> always<00:00:14.820> try<00:00:14.970> to<00:00:15.000> increase<00:00:15.270> the

than cure I always try to increase the

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.120 
than cure I always try to increase the
amount<00:00:15.600> of<00:00:15.750> distance<00:00:16.080> I'd<00:00:16.320> do<00:00:16.500> every<00:00:16.710> day<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:16.920> go

all our towels are made of it but on the

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.049 
all our towels are made of it but on the
hill<00:00:43.769> if<00:00:43.890> we're<00:00:44.039> wearing<00:00:44.219> cotton<00:00:44.550> socks<00:00:44.850> all

day<00:00:45.239> it's<00:00:45.780> going<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.079> keep<00:00:46.230> our<00:00:46.440> skin<00:00:46.800> damp<00:00:47.129> and

day it's going to keep our skin damp and

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:49.400 
day it's going to keep our skin damp and
dampness<00:00:48.269> is<00:00:48.510> one<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.809> reasons<00:00:49.170> we<00:00:49.289> get

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
dampness is one of the reasons we get

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.340 
dampness is one of the reasons we get
blisters<00:00:50.149> so<00:00:51.149> cotton<00:00:51.480> socks<00:00:51.690> are<00:00:51.870> out<00:00:52.019> and

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
blisters so cotton socks are out and

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.770 
blisters so cotton socks are out and
instead<00:00:53.280> we<00:00:53.460> want<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.670> be<00:00:53.760> wearing<00:00:54.059> materials

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
instead we want to be wearing materials

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.380 
instead we want to be wearing materials
like<00:00:54.960> polyester<00:00:55.379> or<00:00:55.949> wool<00:00:56.039> like<00:00:56.940> these<00:00:57.120> ones

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
like polyester or wool like these ones

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.020 
like polyester or wool like these ones
another<00:00:58.350> cause<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.589> blistering<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.339> friction

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
another cause of blistering is friction

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.689 
another cause of blistering is friction
between<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.539> foot<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.170> boot<00:01:01.550> you<00:01:02.550> can

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
between the foot and the boot you can

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.400 
between the foot and the boot you can
easily<00:01:02.850> get<00:01:03.089> around<00:01:03.359> this<00:01:03.539> by<00:01:03.780> wearing<00:01:04.110> not

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.410 
easily get around this by wearing not

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.550 
easily get around this by wearing not
one<00:01:04.739> but<00:01:05.070> two<00:01:05.430> pairs<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.940> socks<00:01:06.200> so<00:01:07.200> first<00:01:07.440> of

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
merino wool socks but you could wear

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.770 
merino wool socks but you could wear
synthetic<00:01:12.930> polyester<00:01:13.500> socks<00:01:13.890> if<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.100> prefer

you're going to go somewhere cold onto a
glass<00:01:30.150> ear<00:01:30.480> you'll<00:01:30.810> want<00:01:31.050> a<00:01:31.080> really<00:01:31.320> thick

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
get cold and it also depends upon how

get cold and it also depends upon how
much<00:01:35.730> room<00:01:36.000> you've<00:01:36.180> got<00:01:36.390> in<00:01:36.540> your<00:01:36.660> boot<00:01:37.850> by

wearing two pairs of socks like this
you're<00:01:41.610> dramatically<00:01:42.330> cutting<00:01:42.600> down<00:01:42.840> the

you're dramatically cutting down the

you're dramatically cutting down the
chance<00:01:43.230> of<00:01:43.350> any<00:01:43.500> friction<00:01:43.890> occurring<00:01:44.640> which

chance of any friction occurring which

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.520 
chance of any friction occurring which
means<00:01:45.690> you've<00:01:45.840> got<00:01:45.870> a<00:01:46.050> long<00:01:46.320> way<00:01:46.500> to
