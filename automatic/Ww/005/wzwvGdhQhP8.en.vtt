tree now I'm being pen now on B pen all
right<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.189> these<00:01:20.430> are<00:01:20.490> weaker<00:01:21.270> than<00:01:21.299> RPGs<00:01:22.170> as

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
right so these are weaker than RPGs as

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.050 
right so these are weaker than RPGs as
well<00:01:22.619> because<00:01:22.950> they're<00:01:23.159> on<00:01:23.280> this<00:01:23.369> was<00:01:23.579> an<00:01:23.700> RPG

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060
