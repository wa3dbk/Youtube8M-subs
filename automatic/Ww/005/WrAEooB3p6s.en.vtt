hi I'm Aaron Gregory on behalf of expert
village<00:00:05.040> we're<00:00:05.670> going<00:00:05.700> to<00:00:05.819> talk<00:00:06.029> about<00:00:06.180> what

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
village we're going to talk about what

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.299 
village we're going to talk about what
happens<00:00:06.750> when<00:00:06.810> your<00:00:06.990> car<00:00:07.169> battery<00:00:07.350> dies<00:00:07.740> how

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
happens when your car battery dies how

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.220 
happens when your car battery dies how
to<00:00:08.340> select<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.850> new<00:00:08.879> battery<00:00:08.969> and<00:00:09.450> how<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:10.110> see

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
to select a new battery and how to see

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.949 
to select a new battery and how to see
what<00:00:10.619> the<00:00:10.709> problem<00:00:11.070> is<00:00:11.539> now<00:00:12.539> when<00:00:12.719> you<00:00:12.809> go<00:00:12.930> to

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:12.959 
what the problem is now when you go to

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:14.689 
what the problem is now when you go to
put<00:00:13.199> the<00:00:13.320> new<00:00:13.440> battery<00:00:13.799> in<00:00:13.889> you're<00:00:14.490> going<00:00:14.639> to

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:14.699 
put the new battery in you're going to

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:16.039 
put the new battery in you're going to
want<00:00:14.850> to<00:00:14.910> figure<00:00:15.090> out<00:00:15.209> where<00:00:15.420> your<00:00:15.570> positive

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
want to figure out where your positive

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.570 
want to figure out where your positive
and<00:00:16.170> negative<00:00:16.230> cables<00:00:16.890> come<00:00:17.100> out<00:00:17.250> so<00:00:17.460> the

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
and negative cables come out so the

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.829 
and negative cables come out so the
battery<00:00:17.880> is<00:00:17.940> orientated<00:00:18.419> in<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.660> right

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:18.839 
battery is orientated in the right

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:20.839 
battery is orientated in the right
direction<00:00:19.019> the<00:00:19.380> first<00:00:19.619> time<00:00:19.919> this<00:00:20.669> is

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:20.849 
direction the first time this is

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:24.710 
direction the first time this is
positive<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.689> this<00:00:22.679> is<00:00:22.740> negative<00:00:22.919> I<00:00:23.720> know

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
positive and this is negative I know

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.359 
positive and this is negative I know
that<00:00:24.990> because<00:00:25.140> I<00:00:25.289> took<00:00:25.439> them<00:00:25.710> off<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.009> battery

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
that because I took them off the battery

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.310 
that because I took them off the battery
that<00:00:26.579> way<00:00:26.730> but<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.329> can<00:00:27.509> find<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.869> negative

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
that way but you can find a negative

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.499 
that way but you can find a negative
terminal<00:00:28.769> because<00:00:29.249> it<00:00:29.519> will<00:00:29.640> be<00:00:29.730> bolted<00:00:29.999> on<00:00:30.300> to

lug we're going to put these up out of

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.320 
lug we're going to put these up out of
the<00:00:46.890> way<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.550> battery<00:00:47.880> doesn't<00:00:47.910> pinch

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:48.330 
the way so the battery doesn't pinch

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.570 
the way so the battery doesn't pinch
them<00:00:48.570> down<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.470> carefully<00:00:49.890> lift<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.190> battery

we can thread this nut down onto the
threaded<00:01:43.470> rod<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.979> tighten<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.340> battery<00:01:44.960> now

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
threaded rod and tighten the battery now

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.690 
threaded rod and tighten the battery now
you've<00:01:46.140> got<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.320> few<00:01:46.590> pieces<00:01:46.800> here<00:01:47.190> to<00:01:47.340> hold<00:01:47.550> in

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
you've got a few pieces here to hold in

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.400 
you've got a few pieces here to hold in

tighten<00:01:52.410> them<00:01:52.500> evenly<00:01:53.009> so<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.700> battery

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
tighten them evenly so that the battery

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.790 
tighten them evenly so that the battery
doesn't<00:01:54.300> suffer<00:01:54.750> too<00:01:54.899> much<00:01:55.050> pressure<00:01:55.380> on<00:01:55.530> one

the terminal down on to the battery as

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.400 
the terminal down on to the battery as
hard<00:02:30.080> as<00:02:30.200> I<00:02:30.320> can<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:31.480> tighten<00:02:32.480> it<00:02:32.570> up<00:02:32.690> by

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
hard as I can and tighten it up by

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.160 
hard as I can and tighten it up by

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
pushing down and twisting it opens up

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.370 
pushing down and twisting it opens up
the<00:02:39.320> ring<00:02:40.030> it<00:02:41.030> makes<00:02:41.270> this<00:02:41.390> best<00:02:41.660> contact<00:02:42.140> as

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
the ring it makes this best contact as

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.710 
the ring it makes this best contact as
possible<00:02:42.820> and<00:02:43.820> then<00:02:43.940> tightening<00:02:44.390> it<00:02:44.570> slightly

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
possible and then tightening it slightly

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.230 
possible and then tightening it slightly
until<00:02:47.720> you<00:02:47.810> can't<00:02:48.050> twist<00:02:48.290> it<00:02:48.530> any<00:02:48.590> more

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
until you can't twist it any more

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.600 
until you can't twist it any more
now<00:02:50.240> our<00:02:50.420> battery<00:02:50.780> is<00:02:50.870> reconnected<00:02:51.680> and<00:02:51.890> we

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
now our battery is reconnected and we

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.729 
now our battery is reconnected and we
have<00:02:52.730> cleaned<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.180> terminals<00:02:53.690> and<00:02:53.930> we've

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
have cleaned the terminals and we've

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.610 
have cleaned the terminals and we've
checked<00:02:55.040> for<00:02:55.280> corrosion<00:02:55.700> inside<00:02:55.850> the<00:02:56.239> wires

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
checked for corrosion inside the wires

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.550 
checked for corrosion inside the wires
the<00:02:57.620> engine<00:02:57.920> should<00:02:58.100> start<00:02:58.489> now
