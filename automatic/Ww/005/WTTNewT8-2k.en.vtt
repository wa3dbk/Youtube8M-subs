00:00:08.285 --> 00:00:10.135

00:00:12.035 --> 00:00:13.405
 amount? 

00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:20.105
 What's wrong with me? 

00:00:20.105 --> 00:00:24.475
 Steve, you are an idiot! 

00:00:30.342 --> 00:00:31.942
 Who's there? 

00:00:43.095 --> 00:00:43.715
 what! 

00:00:43.715 --> 00:00:45.905
 who are you!? 

00:00:45.905 --> 00:00:50.215
 Ah! It is you! Don't hurt my hero 

00:00:50.215 --> 00:00:51.925
 I am just a low servant. 

00:00:51.925 --> 00:00:54.585
 a servant with a big nose 

00:00:54.585 --> 00:00:55.745
 To shut up. 

00:00:55.745 --> 00:00:56.785
 hero? 

00:00:56.785 --> 00:01:00.255
 There is a pinball machine! 

00:01:03.755 --> 00:01:06.645
 The amount of money is high and high! 

00:01:08.645 --> 00:01:11.355
 His hand is broken! 

00:01:11.355 --> 00:01:13.425
 Your hand... broken... 

00:01:13.995 --> 00:01:16.215
 Wait a moment! I will get something for you. 

00:01:27.305 --> 00:01:28.605
 amount... 

00:01:30.175 --> 00:01:31.515
 You are quiet. 

00:01:31.985 --> 00:01:34.635
 I hate you. You hate you too. 

00:01:34.635 --> 00:01:36.805
 But can we only be together? 

00:01:49.395 --> 00:01:51.085
 There is no stairs here. 

00:01:51.085 --> 00:01:53.815
 Holding and drinking it 

00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:07.975
 What is this place? 

00:02:07.975 --> 00:02:10.257
 It used to be the home of many villagers. 

00:02:10.257 --> 00:02:14.355
 The statue is the temple they used to worship the great heroes. 

00:02:14.355 --> 00:02:15.975
 (Evil) Yes, great hero 

00:02:15.975 --> 00:02:18.065
 Great hero? 

00:02:18.065 --> 00:02:21.185
 Great hero.... (evil) great hero 

00:02:21.185 --> 00:02:27.095
 Great hero 

00:02:28.226 --> 00:02:29.295
 amount... 

00:02:29.295 --> 00:02:30.725
 What's up with him? 

00:02:30.725 --> 00:02:34.365
 (Evil) Don't ask... Waiting for this person is a bit wrong. 

00:02:34.365 --> 00:02:38.075
 I like cheese tortillas. 

00:02:39.245 --> 00:02:44.725
 He will be fine, he will only return to the original after a few hours of collision. 

00:02:44.725 --> 00:02:49.735
 Oh... forgive my master, but why are you looking for us? 

00:02:49.735 --> 00:02:52.734
 We are looking for a stronghold 

00:02:52.734 --> 00:02:56.364
 But we fell into your death trap-like roller coaster. 

00:02:56.364 --> 00:02:58.825
 Do you know where there is a stronghold? 

00:02:58.825 --> 00:03:03.805
 It seems that you are looking for the right place here on the entrance to a village. 

00:03:03.805 --> 00:03:05.765
 Oh, thank you very much! 

00:03:05.765 --> 00:03:07.875
 (Evil) Wait! Why didn't he remember? 

00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:14.665
 Yeah, great heroes should have known the location of the stronghold. 

00:03:14.665 --> 00:03:19.695
 Great hero? You thought I was... 

00:03:25.025 --> 00:03:28.235
 (Mexico) I am the king of Mexico 

00:03:29.915 --> 00:03:34.805
 I don't want to break your good wishes, but that's really not me. 

00:03:37.035 --> 00:03:41.035
 He is not him... (evil) but they look too much like it! 

00:03:41.035 --> 00:03:45.325
 I know but still different... (evil) If not who he is!? 

00:03:50.865 --> 00:03:52.855
 Amount..Hello? 

00:03:55.815 --> 00:03:59.415
 Oh, I hope that your journey will find what you are looking for. 

00:04:09.985 --> 00:04:12.225
 Amount... Thank you? 

00:04:22.875 --> 00:04:26.315
 Don't worry about the little guy, we are coming soon. 

00:04:26.315 --> 00:04:28.735
 Why thank you Betty! 

00:04:31.505 --> 00:04:33.245
 Where have you put it? 

00:04:33.245 --> 00:04:36.895
 (Evil) find the hat! You now look like an ordinary villager. 

00:04:36.895 --> 00:04:38.795
 What do you think I am looking for? 

00:04:39.415 --> 00:04:41.815
 found it. 

00:04:47.442 --> 00:04:49.425
 (Evil) Now we are all ready. 

00:04:52.682 --> 00:04:57.362
 Why... you want to... eat... 

00:04:57.362 --> 00:05:00.762
 All those... diamonds!? 

00:05:00.762 --> 00:05:05.092
 Wow. Your eyes.. The eyes are beautiful... 

00:05:06.102 --> 00:05:08.202
 We have arrived. 

00:05:10.392 --> 00:05:17.202
 Spell.... 

00:05:20.982 --> 00:05:24.682
 The owner you are looking for is here! 

00:06:03.976 --> 00:06:06.886
