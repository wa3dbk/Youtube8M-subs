in<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.220> for<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.400> data<00:01:05.640> that's<00:01:05.909> what<00:01:06.060> they

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
in it for the data that's what they

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.700 
in it for the data that's what they
really<00:01:06.299> want<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:07.140> think<00:01:07.200> apple<00:01:07.619> is

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
really want and I think apple is

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.780 
really want and I think apple is
probably<00:01:07.979> going<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.189> try<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.400> differentiate

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
probably going to try to differentiate

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.340 
probably going to try to differentiate
itself<00:01:09.210> on<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.600> quality<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.110> hardware

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
itself on the quality of the hardware

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.130 
itself on the quality of the hardware
and<00:01:10.680> it's<00:01:11.130> it's<00:01:11.670> obsessive<00:01:12.119> focus<00:01:12.450> on<00:01:12.750> privacy

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
and it's it's obsessive focus on privacy

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.300 
and it's it's obsessive focus on privacy
which<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.500> what<00:01:13.650> people<00:01:13.770> are<00:01:13.979> more<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.189> more

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
which is what people are more and more

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.399 
which is what people are more and more
concerned<00:01:14.610> about<00:01:14.760> because<00:01:15.330> we<00:01:15.479> love<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.170> idea

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
concerned about because we love the idea

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.899 
concerned about because we love the idea
of<00:01:16.500> having<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.799> convenience<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.549> Apple<00:01:17.790> and

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
of having the convenience of Apple and

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.280 
of having the convenience of Apple and
Google<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.180> our<00:01:18.299> home<00:01:18.479> but<00:01:18.659> when<00:01:18.810> we<00:01:18.930> start<00:01:19.200> to

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
Google in our home but when we start to

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.929 
Google in our home but when we start to
think<00:01:19.439> about<00:01:19.650> how<00:01:20.189> much<00:01:20.400> they'll<00:01:20.610> start<00:01:20.850> to

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
think about how much they'll start to

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.340 
think about how much they'll start to
know<00:01:21.090> about<00:01:21.240> us<00:01:21.540> that's<00:01:21.869> when<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.140> gets<00:01:22.229> a

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
know about us that's when it gets a

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.200 
know about us that's when it gets a
little<00:01:22.500> bit<00:01:22.710> dicey<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.310> it's<00:01:23.549> not<00:01:23.700> just<00:01:23.759> um

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
little bit dicey and it's not just um

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.030 
little bit dicey and it's not just um
you<00:01:24.570> know<00:01:24.720> Apple<00:01:25.259> or<00:01:25.380> Google<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.740> will<00:01:25.920> have

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
you know Apple or Google that will have

into its next big business especially

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.500 
into its next big business especially
the<00:02:11.160> music<00:02:11.489> saw<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:12.090> music<00:02:12.360> platform

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
the music saw the music platform

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.309 
the music saw the music platform
component

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
component

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.229 
component
which<00:02:13.680> they<00:02:14.010> are<00:02:14.249> touting<00:02:14.670> more<00:02:14.879> than<00:02:15.060> the

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
which they are touting more than the

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.270 
which they are touting more than the
headphones<00:02:15.629> so<00:02:16.379> it's<00:02:17.040> going<00:02:17.129> to<00:02:17.219> be

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
headphones so it's going to be

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.649 
headphones so it's going to be
interesting<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.639> see<00:02:17.760> how<00:02:17.790> this<00:02:17.999> fits<00:02:18.060> in<00:02:18.450> with

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
interesting to see how this fits in with

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.599 
interesting to see how this fits in with
the<00:02:18.689> bigger<00:02:19.019> picture<00:02:19.319> yeah<00:02:19.859> I<00:02:19.889> think<00:02:20.159> also<00:02:20.280> in

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:20.609 
the bigger picture yeah I think also in

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:22.849 
the bigger picture yeah I think also in
terms<00:02:20.819> of<00:02:20.999> the<00:02:21.150> bigger<00:02:21.389> picture<00:02:21.719> I<00:02:22.109> think<00:02:22.739> it's

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:22.859 
terms of the bigger picture I think it's

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:24.259 
terms of the bigger picture I think it's
important<00:02:23.219> to<00:02:23.249> note<00:02:23.430> how<00:02:23.609> so<00:02:23.969> many<00:02:24.060> of<00:02:24.180> these

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
important to note how so many of these

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.660 
important to note how so many of these
companies<00:02:24.480> are<00:02:24.719> being<00:02:25.590> consolidated<00:02:25.980> until

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
companies are being consolidated until

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.489 
companies are being consolidated until
larger<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.299> larger<00:02:27.420> companies<00:02:28.019> that<00:02:28.200> kind<00:02:28.409> of

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:28.499 
larger and larger companies that kind of

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:30.589 
larger and larger companies that kind of
have<00:02:28.680> more<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.069> bigger<00:02:29.849> impact<00:02:30.209> on<00:02:30.389> our<00:02:30.569> lives

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.280 
with ibeacon and then you know we walk
out<00:02:56.519> the<00:02:56.639> door<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:56.849> we<00:02:56.969> listen<00:02:57.239> to<00:02:57.419> our<00:02:57.780> iPhone

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
out the door and we listen to our iPhone

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.839 
out the door and we listen to our iPhone
with<00:02:58.530> music<00:02:58.980> that<00:02:59.010> we<00:02:59.189> bought<00:02:59.340> through<00:02:59.519> itunes

with music that we bought through itunes

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.280 
with music that we bought through itunes
I<00:03:00.030> mean<00:03:00.180> it's<00:03:00.359> really<00:03:00.689> crazy<00:03:00.900> when<00:03:01.169> you<00:03:01.199> think

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
I mean it's really crazy when you think

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.349 
I mean it's really crazy when you think
about<00:03:01.439> how<00:03:01.769> much<00:03:02.040> there<00:03:02.280> and<00:03:02.790> we<00:03:03.000> like<00:03:03.209> it

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
about how much there and we like it

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:04.580 
about how much there and we like it
because<00:03:03.480> it's<00:03:03.689> convenient<00:03:04.019> or<00:03:04.230> at<00:03:04.290> least<00:03:04.439> I

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
because it's convenient or at least I

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.990 
because it's convenient or at least I
like<00:03:04.769> it<00:03:04.949> because<00:03:05.040> it's<00:03:05.310> convenient<00:03:05.639> you<00:03:05.879> know

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
like it because it's convenient you know

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.759 
like it because it's convenient you know

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:20.729 
tell you what you're sacrificing I think

we're sacrificing the ability to

we're sacrificing the ability to

even you know the basic version of

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
Apple's what is it called the remote

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.740 
Apple's what is it called the remote
control<00:03:29.280> app<00:03:29.639> on<00:03:29.939> your<00:03:30.030> phone<00:03:30.090> that<00:03:30.449> controls

control app on your phone that controls

control app on your phone that controls
lights<00:03:30.989> and<00:03:31.199> Apple<00:03:31.680> TV<00:03:32.009> then<00:03:32.849> you<00:03:33.000> know<00:03:33.150> that

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
lights and Apple TV then you know that

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.520 
lights and Apple TV then you know that
you<00:03:33.419> can<00:03:33.569> never<00:03:33.659> even<00:03:33.930> watch<00:03:34.139> TV<00:03:34.319> without

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
you can never even watch TV without

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.099 
you can never even watch TV without
being<00:03:34.859> by<00:03:35.009> your<00:03:35.159> phone<00:03:35.459> so<00:03:36.180> it's<00:03:36.750> actually<00:03:37.049> a

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
being by your phone so it's actually a

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:38.809 
being by your phone so it's actually a
very<00:03:37.199> clever<00:03:37.409> way<00:03:37.650> to<00:03:37.680> keep<00:03:37.919> you<00:03:38.129> in<00:03:38.459> the

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
very clever way to keep you in the

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.550 
very clever way to keep you in the
ecosystem<00:03:39.060> but<00:03:39.959> I<00:03:40.019> think<00:03:40.259> there's<00:03:40.409> a<00:03:40.439> huge

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
ecosystem but I think there's a huge

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.929 
ecosystem but I think there's a huge
downside<00:03:40.799> if<00:03:41.129> you<00:03:41.220> just<00:03:41.400> want<00:03:41.519> to<00:03:41.549> be<00:03:41.639> able<00:03:41.699> to

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:41.939 
downside if you just want to be able to

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:44.030 
downside if you just want to be able to
not<00:03:42.209> be<00:03:42.629> near<00:03:42.810> your<00:03:42.900> phone<00:03:43.019> while<00:03:43.259> you<00:03:43.319> watch<00:03:43.500> I

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
not be near your phone while you watch I

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.129 
not be near your phone while you watch I
love<00:03:44.220> to<00:03:44.340> do<00:03:44.430> hi<00:03:44.729> I<00:03:45.060> love<00:03:45.449> to<00:03:45.569> do<00:03:45.659> it<00:03:45.750> too<00:03:45.870> but<00:03:45.989> it

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
love to do hi I love to do it too but it

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:47.929 
love to do hi I love to do it too but it
actually<00:03:46.409> causes<00:03:46.799> people<00:03:47.310> like<00:03:47.549> separation

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:47.939 
actually causes people like separation

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:49.580 
actually causes people like separation
anxiety<00:03:48.540> to<00:03:48.659> be<00:03:48.780> away<00:03:48.989> from<00:03:49.019> their<00:03:49.349> phone

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
anxiety to be away from their phone

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.009 
anxiety to be away from their phone
right<00:03:49.889> and<00:03:50.819> I<00:03:51.090> think<00:03:51.150> that's<00:03:51.329> very<00:03:51.540> telling

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
right and I think that's very telling

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.960 
right and I think that's very telling
that<00:03:52.349> we're<00:03:52.650> falling<00:03:53.370> in<00:03:53.459> love<00:03:53.669> with<00:03:53.849> our

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
that we're falling in love with our

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.219 
that we're falling in love with our
phones<00:03:54.180> and<00:03:54.419> we<00:03:54.509> need<00:03:54.629> them<00:03:54.780> really<00:03:55.019> really

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:55.229 
phones and we need them really really

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:56.539 
phones and we need them really really
close<00:03:55.409> but<00:03:55.590> it<00:03:55.739> makes<00:03:55.919> sense<00:03:56.219> when<00:03:56.430> they

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
close but it makes sense when they

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.759 
close but it makes sense when they
provide<00:03:56.849> so<00:03:57.180> many<00:03:57.299> services<00:03:57.840> to<00:03:58.409> us<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:58.709> they

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
provide so many services to us and they

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.439 
provide so many services to us and they
keep<00:03:58.949> us<00:03:59.069> connected<00:03:59.250> to<00:03:59.699> not<00:04:00.030> just<00:04:00.269> our

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:00.449 
keep us connected to not just our

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:02.270 
keep us connected to not just our
devices<00:04:00.780> but<00:04:01.109> also<00:04:01.259> people<00:04:01.799> in<00:04:02.009> our<00:04:02.129> lives

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
devices but also people in our lives

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.309 
devices but also people in our lives
yeah<00:04:02.699> well<00:04:02.969> that's<00:04:03.150> it<00:04:03.359> virtually<00:04:03.540> yeah

don't<00:04:06.750> know<00:04:06.870> I<00:04:06.959> think<00:04:07.079> this<00:04:07.290> could<00:04:07.409> change

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:07.439 
don't know I think this could change
