00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
it may seem really in my opinion of

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:03.980 
it may seem really in my opinion of
course<00:02:02.790> i<00:02:02.909> can<00:02:03.030> understand<00:02:03.390> why<00:02:03.540> people<00:02:03.840> love

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990

this<00:02:04.170> game<00:02:04.320> but<00:02:04.530> when<00:02:05.009> i<00:02:05.040> started<00:02:05.520> this<00:02:05.759> game<00:02:05.969> i

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
this game but when i started this game i

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.540 
this game but when i started this game i
bought<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.570> for<00:02:06.600> about<00:02:06.869> 10<00:02:07.290> bucks<00:02:07.500> then<00:02:08.250> yours

actually and i think that's a waste of
money<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.349> i<00:02:10.530> will<00:02:10.649> tell<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:10.950> why<00:02:11.039> because

this game doesn't feel like it's done
yet<00:02:12.870> that's

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.320 
yet that's
the<00:02:13.620> whole<00:02:13.800> that's<00:02:14.489> the<00:02:14.640> whole<00:02:14.760> vibe<00:02:15.090> I<00:02:15.270> get

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
the whole that's the whole vibe I get

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.240

from it just feels like and game that
it's<00:02:20.250> just<00:02:20.550> an<00:02:20.790> elf<00:02:21.060> I<00:02:21.420> suppose<00:02:21.930> perhaps<00:02:22.170> a

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
it's just an elf I suppose perhaps a

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.229 
it's just an elf I suppose perhaps a
closed<00:02:22.860> beta<00:02:23.220> that's<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.700> stage<00:02:23.940> where<00:02:24.209> I

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
closed beta that's the stage where I

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.960 
closed beta that's the stage where I
feel<00:02:24.569> like<00:02:24.720> this<00:02:24.900> game<00:02:24.989> is<00:02:25.319> in<00:02:25.970> because

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:13.409 
for these air diners but they can't keep

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:15.499 
for these air diners but they can't keep
up<00:05:13.560> with<00:05:13.590> you<00:05:13.740> because<00:05:13.979> you're<00:05:14.280> faster<00:05:14.789> and

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:15.509

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
you can also take him out relatively

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:20.689 
you can also take him out relatively
easy<00:05:17.419> so<00:05:18.419> there's<00:05:18.659> also<00:05:18.840> no<00:05:19.259> real<00:05:19.590> balance<00:05:20.310> in

dangerous right here and you know one of

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:36.080 
dangerous right here and you know one of

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
those airborne dinosaurs that tries to

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.649 
those airborne dinosaurs that tries to
get<00:05:36.479> me<00:05:36.889> but<00:05:37.889> it<00:05:38.460> doesn't<00:05:38.880> really<00:05:39.000> do<00:05:39.360> anything

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:39.659 
get me but it doesn't really do anything

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:42.260 
get me but it doesn't really do anything
it's<00:05:40.259> it's<00:05:40.500> it's<00:05:41.310> one<00:05:41.460> of<00:05:41.550> these<00:05:41.669> games<00:05:41.940> once

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
it's it's it's one of these games once

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.240 
it's it's it's one of these games once
you<00:05:42.389> get<00:05:42.509> behind<00:05:43.139> a<00:05:43.289> certain<00:05:43.650> point<00:05:43.889> it<00:05:44.219> just

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
you get behind a certain point it just

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.969 
you get behind a certain point it just
it's<00:05:44.880> not<00:05:45.029> worth<00:05:45.330> it<00:05:45.479> anymore<00:05:45.750> and<00:05:46.650> I<00:05:46.949> don't

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 
it's not worth it anymore and I don't

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:49.279 
it's not worth it anymore and I don't
think<00:05:47.400> that<00:05:47.520> a<00:05:47.729> game<00:05:48.029> like<00:05:48.210> this<00:05:48.389> is<00:05:48.569> worth<00:05:48.840> 10

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:49.289 
think that a game like this is worth 10

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:52.309 
think that a game like this is worth 10
euros<00:05:49.909> it's<00:05:50.909> in<00:05:51.389> my<00:05:51.419> opinion<00:05:51.750> it's<00:05:51.900> really<00:05:52.199> not

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:52.319 
euros it's in my opinion it's really not

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:54.200 
euros it's in my opinion it's really not
and<00:05:52.529> also<00:05:52.770> right<00:05:53.069> here<00:05:53.340> one<00:05:53.490> of<00:05:53.580> the<00:05:53.729> easier

first impressions you don't have to take
it<00:06:26.250> to<00:06:26.400> heart<00:06:26.960> but<00:06:27.960> this<00:06:28.830> game<00:06:29.009> had<00:06:29.279> a<00:06:29.310> lot<00:06:29.490> of

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 
it to heart but this game had a lot of

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.019 
it to heart but this game had a lot of
potential<00:06:29.879> I<00:06:30.120> think<00:06:30.779> it<00:06:30.900> just<00:06:31.789> didn't<00:06:32.789> work

00:06:33.019 --> 00:06:33.029 
potential I think it just didn't work

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:35.779 
potential I think it just didn't work
out<00:06:33.300> the<00:06:33.539> way<00:06:33.569> they<00:06:33.840> want<00:06:34.169> to<00:06:34.319> do<00:06:34.500> or<00:06:34.759> they<00:06:35.759> just

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:35.789 
out the way they want to do or they just

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:37.159 
out the way they want to do or they just
didn't<00:06:36.180> spend<00:06:36.449> the<00:06:36.509> amount<00:06:36.659> of<00:06:36.779> time<00:06:37.020> they

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:37.169 
didn't spend the amount of time they

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:39.270 
didn't spend the amount of time they
kuda<00:06:37.680> I<00:06:37.949> don't<00:06:38.159> I<00:06:38.370> don't<00:06:38.399> know<00:06:38.639> why
