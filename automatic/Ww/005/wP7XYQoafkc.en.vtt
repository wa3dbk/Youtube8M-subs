00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello today i want to show you how 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.540
 she simply makes her own song 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.970
 we can use it to compose 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:15.299
 the clip case as an insult companion 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:17.670
 and harmony scheme that would be the case 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.500
 Of course it's nothing special 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.900
 However, it is the accompaniment if we 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.160
 to improvise a melody on it 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.960
 we are very special 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.930
 we can improvise the melody 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.930
 about the fundamental tone we have at the beginning 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.740
 mdb and again pulls yes than they have 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.790
 of course the sounds 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.760
 the idea 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.100
 they hook behind to take clear when 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.390
 We would like to have it all as a mega chord 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:53.550
 but let us then as this 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:56.390
 scanner f also clearly asks you to do it 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.390
 we dared 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.070
 hdf dissonant also has its 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:09.850
 accuracy 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:09.850
 Now go you are on the ball now 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.939
 ac ad 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.250
 the fdp 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.320
 ghd and also know again patient 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.060
 and you are free to buy your own pieces 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.060
 come compensate 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.100
 Of course, they can also be exciting 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.430
 struggling to make a stopgap like 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.430
 follows 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.020
 now 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.130
 probably offers a piece 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.630
 The queen case is composed very much 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.460
 Practically will also be in many pieces 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.460
 uses example emitter 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.390
 and have here 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:53.739
 that the case of b in this case 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.530
 of course, ordon service already with play 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.000
 tat is all glorious I know 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.870
 I hope I could help them and up 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.870
 to the next tutorial
