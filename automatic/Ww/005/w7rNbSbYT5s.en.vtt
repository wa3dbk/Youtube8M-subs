00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
first saw it during the presentation I

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.039 
first saw it during the presentation I
was<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.340> little<00:01:20.790> bit<00:01:20.909> skeptical<00:01:21.509> but<00:01:21.630> once<00:01:21.810> they

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
was a little bit skeptical but once they

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.410 
was a little bit skeptical but once they
started<00:01:22.439> showing<00:01:22.680> off<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.189> apps<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.820> how<00:01:24.270> it

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
started showing off the apps and how it

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.149 
started showing off the apps and how it
all<00:01:24.540> functions<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.229> everything<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.860> think

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
all functions and everything I think

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.530 
all functions and everything I think
this<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:26.729> going<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.030> be<00:01:27.119> something<00:01:27.360> that's

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
this is going to be something that's

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.899 
this is going to be something that's
really<00:01:28.170> really<00:01:28.650> nice<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.280> can't<00:01:29.549> wait<00:01:29.759> to
