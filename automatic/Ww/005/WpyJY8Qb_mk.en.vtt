00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 so I'm here at the institute in 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.860
 Zurich and I just talked 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.790
 with a honor specialists from texas 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.630
 and he has something interesting 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.870
 found out 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.400
 namely that when people in the 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.070
 stress situation are when a certain 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.930
 The complex is then hit in the 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.619
 brain certain parts light up the 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.900
 show more activity and one, so to speak 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.470
 surprising part of the brain in which 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.480
 moment is the one is the 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.430
 movement apparatus so to speak that means the 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.899
 part of your brain the coffin that you 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.079
 move you now so it runs away 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.800
 should and at the same time lit the part 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.850
 in the brain on the halt says 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.460
 I keep myself under control 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.469
 so to speak, the inner censorship in you 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.789
 that was not very important for me 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.129
 interesting because we already 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.219
 have found that if you like for example 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.379
 a date nervous then that is one 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.660
 thing that helps you is when you're in, so to speak 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.800
 ate what if you say yes a time 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.170
 a little jump around and so to speak 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.330
 this whole mental energy is itself 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.820
 this kinetic energy has accumulated the 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.470
 It has not accumulated itself 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.570
 can express when you are out of play 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.509
 that you have to remember afterwards 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.650
 relaxed until and that you just do not 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.140
 the more you have the problem that you no longer 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.700
 knows what you say is like that and that you are the one 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.990
 shaky hands and that you have 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.820
 you can not concentrate that you 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.650
 does not know what yours 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.200
 partner who talks about it during the 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.090
 dates and here you have just how 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.250
 for example you got yourself you have the 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.650
 scientific explanation for why 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.140
 the whole thing happened because at the moment where 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.759
 you are psychologically tense where you are 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.369
 so to speak in a situation that only 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.720
 a complex in which acts in the 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.420
 instant you're not yourself by 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.400
 somehow you do not have any psychic 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.470
 energy free, so to speak 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.410
 to do the things that really matter 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.660
 listening to be relaxed 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.700
 to be creative that is that we 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.340
 that things come to mind about you 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.540
 All these things are the ones that I want to talk about 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.980
 to be really involved in that 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.180
 to be really on the instant 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.460
 instant to respond 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.290
 you're not in at such a moment 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.420
 able to do that because of your whole 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.490
 Psychic energy is used up 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.920
 That's going to make you think yourself, so to speak 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.910
 fight against these two antagonists 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.920
 in a house on one side 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.510
 automatic nervous system what do you say 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.340
 do not have to move you have to have to 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.050
 what do you do that is a scary situation 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.180
 This is just a situation where you are 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.650
 is to run away is or was loud 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.840
 shouting that should or would something 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.480
 on the other side should do that 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.250
 Cortex in the front that says you have to 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.420
 keep still you must not attract attention 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.100
 other people should not realize that 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.780
 I'm just going and so on and so on 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.950
 away and these two parts of the brain 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.720
 they fight against each other 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.940
 And that costs an incredible amount of energy 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.800
 and that means that for the rest 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.360
 his brain, so to speak, no energy 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.830
 are left, and so can you 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.450
 that's why you have that 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.190
 Feeling you are standing next to you and that's why 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.290
 the things are not remembered 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.340
 you normally just immediately 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.680
 Maybe she happened before 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.420
 I asked something at a beet woman 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.950
 usually you are super spontaneous 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.840
 answer and now you can do that 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.950
 Tell a story or that would be the 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.690
 name immediately 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.920
 but all sorts of things are for that 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.769
 full name not one the the 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.510
 usually come up 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.830
 you are on the hose with topics 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.450
 those who normally care 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.280
 you would and you are just acting totally 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.120
 The explanation for it now has to be agreed 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.310
 where does that come from in a complex of 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.330
 you are hit that your brain 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.070
 responds by so at least that 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.269
 pre with the primitive parts of the brain 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.540
 says you have to move 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:35.220
 you have to run away from the situation and 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.799
 but the modern part of the brain says 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.540
 You can not just do it again 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.160
 say if you have problems with that 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.170
 you're nervous no matter if it's from a beet 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.610
 or is the one before a test 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.650
 The thing that helps is that this 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.450
 pent up energy that you short 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.340
 rauslÃ¤sst by looking like me so the 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.380
 beautiful ape thus makes a 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.090
 bit k changes 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.930
 okay that was pretty on the date 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.610
 But they can do that 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.680
 before you can go and at home time 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.220
 that can be done if the second one 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.660
 At home 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:07.819
 before the person comes to you and you 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.020
 can do just as well just by times 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.640
 short on toilet gesture apologizes 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.010
 be brief during the dates if you 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.150
 Do you have a short break on toilet and 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.010
 lets go of it in the way 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.630
 get out of energy and realize that you 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.609
 you feel better because you are not with 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.220
 this inner battle almost was no 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.590
 more this accumulated engine determined 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:28.430
 the pent-up kinetic energy of this 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:33.880
 pent up need for it 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:36.770
 move and the complex, so to speak 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.580
 to give expression through movement that 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.080
 Do not you have any more then? 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.970
 then again the energies are 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.919
 released you are more with you again 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.780
 is more centered again and you are 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.280
 more in the moment and the things 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.160
 then happen more or less 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.540
 automatically with you because we are 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.060
 spontaneous and because the video is the 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.440
 Okay, we think so 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.890
 see us in the next video I wish 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.640
 you something else 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.640
 until then bye
