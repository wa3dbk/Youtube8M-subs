let's build upon that and create a
simple<00:02:28.180> game<00:02:28.450> in<00:02:28.629> our<00:02:28.750> world<00:02:28.959> step<00:02:29.650> one<00:02:29.890> our

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
simple game in our world step one our

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.119 
simple game in our world step one our
home<00:02:30.700> base<00:02:31.019> so<00:02:32.019> let's<00:02:32.170> use<00:02:32.319> this<00:02:32.500> village<00:02:32.890> I

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
home base so let's use this village I

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:35.339 
home base so let's use this village I
can<00:02:33.879> place<00:02:34.030> this<00:02:34.180> anywhere<00:02:34.480> I'd<00:02:34.629> like<00:02:34.810> I'll

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
can place this anywhere I'd like I'll

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.229 
can place this anywhere I'd like I'll
put<00:02:35.470> it<00:02:35.560> right<00:02:35.650> here<00:02:35.709> this'll<00:02:36.549> be<00:02:36.730> our<00:02:36.760> town

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
put it right here this'll be our town

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.440 
put it right here this'll be our town
square<00:02:38.400> alright<00:02:39.400> step<00:02:39.760> 2<00:02:39.970> let's<00:02:40.269> add<00:02:40.420> some

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
square alright step 2 let's add some

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.539 
square alright step 2 let's add some
behaviors<00:02:41.140> now<00:02:41.410> everything<00:02:41.980> in<00:02:42.069> projects

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
behaviors now everything in projects

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.270 
behaviors now everything in projects
part<00:02:42.819> has<00:02:43.329> a<00:02:43.360> brain<00:02:43.690> that<00:02:43.840> can<00:02:43.989> be<00:02:44.140> changed

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
part has a brain that can be changed

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.710 
part has a brain that can be changed
let's<00:02:45.280> bring<00:02:45.430> something<00:02:45.880> to<00:02:45.910> life<00:02:46.180> take<00:02:46.569> this

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
let's bring something to life take this

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.500 
let's bring something to life take this
rock<00:02:47.019> for<00:02:47.290> instance<00:02:47.650> its<00:02:48.459> brains<00:02:48.760> empty<00:02:49.299> and

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
rock for instance its brains empty and

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.390 
rock for instance its brains empty and
Claude<00:02:50.200> could<00:02:50.410> go<00:02:50.560> in<00:02:50.709> and<00:02:50.829> add<00:02:50.980> behaviors

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
Claude could go in and add behaviors

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.339 
Claude could go in and add behaviors
line<00:02:51.610> by<00:02:51.790> line<00:02:51.970> but<00:02:52.269> for<00:02:52.450> now<00:02:52.569> we<00:02:53.049> can<00:02:53.200> make

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
line by line but for now we can make

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:55.140 
line by line but for now we can make
this<00:02:53.500> rock<00:02:53.739> become<00:02:54.130> a<00:02:54.160> pet<00:02:54.519> with<00:02:54.730> something<00:02:55.060> we

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
this rock become a pet with something we

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.550 
this rock become a pet with something we
already<00:02:55.299> built<00:02:57.420> so<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:58.510> brain<00:02:58.690> says<00:02:58.989> when<00:02:59.530> the

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
already built so the brain says when the

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.530 
already built so the brain says when the
rock<00:02:59.829> detects<00:03:00.250> me<00:03:00.430> it'll<00:03:00.940> move<00:03:01.060> towards<00:03:01.390> me

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
rock detects me it'll move towards me

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
rock detects me it'll move towards me
and<00:03:01.780> jump<00:03:02.140> pretty<00:03:02.920> simple<00:03:04.170> and<00:03:05.170> just<00:03:05.349> like

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
and jump pretty simple and just like

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.220 
and jump pretty simple and just like
that<00:03:05.590> I've<00:03:06.280> made<00:03:06.459> myself<00:03:06.670> a<00:03:06.940> new<00:03:07.060> friend<00:03:07.329> come

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
it could grow into let's check out how

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.170 
it could grow into let's check out how
other<00:03:45.319> creators<00:03:45.860> in<00:03:46.040> project<00:03:46.459> spark<00:03:46.730> can

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
other creators in project spark can

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:58.620 
other creators in project spark can
remix<00:03:47.630> and<00:03:47.870> build<00:03:48.350> on<00:03:48.650> an<00:03:48.890> idea

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.970 

alright<00:03:59.630> starts<00:04:00.020> off<00:04:00.200> familiar<00:04:00.770> enough

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
alright starts off familiar enough
