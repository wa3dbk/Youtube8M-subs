00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:41.439 

if<00:00:38.239> this<00:00:38.449> is<00:00:38.690> free<00:00:38.899> unreal<00:00:39.289> I<00:00:39.879> can<00:00:40.879> we<00:00:41.420> can

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
if this is free unreal I can we can

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:45.630 
if this is free unreal I can we can
modulate<00:00:42.050> these<00:00:42.739> settings

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:52.260 

I<00:00:49.140> could<00:00:50.140> hear<00:00:50.380> like<00:00:50.710> organ<00:00:51.370> sounds<00:00:51.670> harmonics

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270 
I could hear like organ sounds harmonics

00:00:52.270 --> 00:01:07.359 
I could hear like organ sounds harmonics
and<00:00:52.420> everything<00:00:52.720> happen

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:15.550 

well<00:01:07.939> never<00:01:08.719> quite<00:01:09.500> like<00:01:09.679> this<00:01:09.859> never

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:24.770 

yeah

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.270 

that's<00:01:25.469> so<00:01:25.740> awesome

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
that's so awesome

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.840 
that's so awesome
I<00:01:26.310> like<00:01:26.549> this<00:01:26.670> note<00:01:26.880> along<00:01:27.149> if<00:01:28.049> we<00:01:28.259> do<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.850> now

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
I like this note along if we do that now

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:42.139 
I like this note along if we do that now
we<00:01:29.880> reverse<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.659> field<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.649> go<00:01:31.829> ahead<00:01:41.149> it's

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
we reverse the field so go ahead it's

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.149 
we reverse the field so go ahead it's
actually<00:01:42.810> making<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.380> do<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.770> that's<00:01:43.950> it

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
actually making it do that that's it

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.169 
actually making it do that that's it
that's<00:01:44.520> what<00:01:44.640> blows<00:01:44.819> me<00:01:44.969> away

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
that's what blows me away

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:47.690 
that's what blows me away
is<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.929> it's<00:01:46.079> it's<00:01:46.649> physically<00:01:47.250> stopping

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
is that it's it's physically stopping

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.370 
is that it's it's physically stopping
the<00:01:47.789> stream

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.870 

what<00:01:54.380> I'm<00:01:54.530> about<00:01:54.679> what<00:01:55.130> I'm<00:01:55.280> trying<00:01:55.549> to<00:01:55.640> create

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
what I'm about what I'm trying to create

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.690 
what I'm about what I'm trying to create
is<00:01:56.240> a<00:01:56.810> method<00:01:57.619> of<00:01:57.710> synthesis<00:01:58.310> that<00:01:59.679> occurs

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
is a method of synthesis that occurs

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.160 
is a method of synthesis that occurs
physically<00:02:01.700> in<00:02:01.909> front<00:02:02.479> of<00:02:02.569> you<00:02:02.689> on<00:02:02.899> the

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
physically in front of you on the

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.109 
physically in front of you on the
instrument<00:02:03.649> so<00:02:04.159> you<00:02:04.189> can<00:02:04.429> feel<00:02:04.729> it<00:02:04.850> with<00:02:04.969> your

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
instrument so you can feel it with your

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:05.709 
instrument so you can feel it with your
hands

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
hands

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:07.779 
hands
hear<00:02:06.109> it<00:02:06.200> immediately<00:02:06.380> and<00:02:07.130> acoustically

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
hear it immediately and acoustically

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:09.309 
hear it immediately and acoustically
coming<00:02:08.209> from<00:02:08.360> the<00:02:08.509> instrument<00:02:08.899> with<00:02:09.110> no

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
coming from the instrument with no

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.759 
coming from the instrument with no
intervening<00:02:10.160> amplification<00:02:11.090> and<00:02:11.209> yet<00:02:11.900> it's<00:02:12.620> a

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
intervening amplification and yet it's a

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:14.650 
intervening amplification and yet it's a
sophisticated<00:02:13.580> kind<00:02:13.790> of<00:02:13.910> synthesis<00:02:14.420> that

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
sophisticated kind of synthesis that

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.339 
sophisticated kind of synthesis that
allows<00:02:14.989> us<00:02:15.019> to<00:02:15.700> very<00:02:16.700> deliberately<00:02:17.239> tailor

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:39.190 

sounds<00:02:21.349> and<00:02:21.650> Tambor's

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.990 

well<00:02:39.470> here's<00:02:40.160> something<00:02:40.430> that<00:02:40.700> you<00:02:40.730> don't

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
well here's something that you don't

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.160 
well here's something that you don't
hear<00:02:41.540> very<00:02:41.569> much<00:02:41.990> on<00:02:43.510> if<00:02:44.510> we<00:02:44.660> go<00:02:44.780> to<00:02:44.840> this

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
hear very much on if we go to this

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.260 
hear very much on if we go to this
extreme<00:02:45.560> now<00:02:45.860> we're<00:02:46.099> going<00:02:46.220> to<00:02:46.280> have<00:02:46.489> the<00:02:46.700> the

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
extreme now we're going to have the the

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.530 
extreme now we're going to have the the
other<00:02:47.420> extreme<00:02:47.870> that<00:02:47.930> go<00:02:48.140> ahead<00:02:48.200> and<00:02:48.290> play
