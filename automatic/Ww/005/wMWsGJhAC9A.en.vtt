00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
probably out of 10 matches there are

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.180 
probably out of 10 matches there are
nine<00:00:30.009> toss-ups<00:00:30.880> so<00:00:31.509> you<00:00:32.050> know<00:00:32.169> as<00:00:32.380> a<00:00:32.860> coach

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190

with<00:00:33.430> a<00:00:33.460> team<00:00:33.700> that<00:00:33.730> i<00:00:33.880> think<00:00:34.000> is<00:00:34.210> really

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
with a team that i think is really

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.869 
with a team that i think is really
really<00:00:34.690> good<00:00:34.990> I<00:00:35.320> don't<00:00:36.280> like<00:00:36.430> having<00:00:36.610> tossed

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:36.879

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.080 
up so I want to have sure of things and
I<00:00:38.590> think<00:00:38.620> if<00:00:38.860> we<00:00:38.980> were<00:00:39.160> able<00:00:39.250> to<00:00:39.430> take<00:00:39.940> those

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.090 
I think if we were able to take those

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.389 
I think if we were able to take those
matchups<00:00:40.449> and<00:00:40.930> if<00:00:41.440> I<00:00:41.530> was<00:00:41.680> able<00:00:41.800> to<00:00:41.920> match<00:00:42.190> up

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:42.399

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
where I wanted them we could probably

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.150 
where I wanted them we could probably
find<00:00:44.230> a<00:00:44.320> way<00:00:44.410> where<00:00:44.590> we<00:00:44.620> were<00:00:44.800> really<00:00:44.980> happy

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160
