00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
actually playing him as a striker which

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.859 
actually playing him as a striker which
is<00:01:04.979> pretty<00:01:05.159> sweet<00:01:05.400> maybe<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.270> nice<00:01:06.450> hybrid

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869

around<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.260> world<00:01:07.409> in<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.619> know<00:01:07.710> as<00:01:07.830> well<00:01:07.979> and

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
around the world in you know as well and

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.250 
around the world in you know as well and
feedoe<00:01:08.909> Martinez<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.420> course<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:09.960> think<00:01:10.049> the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
feedoe Martinez of course is I think the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.719 
feedoe Martinez of course is I think the
lowest<00:01:10.439> five<00:01:10.710> stars<00:01:10.979> killer<00:01:11.220> in<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.520> game

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
lowest five stars killer in the game

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.460 
lowest five stars killer in the game
doesn't<00:01:12.420> have<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.720> greatest<00:01:12.930> stats<00:01:13.290> but

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
doesn't have the greatest stats but

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.499 
doesn't have the greatest stats but
still<00:01:13.770> he<00:01:14.280> looks<00:01:14.460> like<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.640> farm<00:01:14.939> car<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.299> use

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
still he looks like a farm car to use

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.960 
still he looks like a farm car to use
and<00:01:15.810> then<00:01:16.409> we<00:01:16.470> move<00:01:16.650> on<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.430> player<00:01:17.820> which

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
and then we move on to a a player which

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.460 
and then we move on to a a player which
actually<00:01:18.150> got<00:01:18.420> transferred<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.320> League

will actually see a non è Manchester
United<00:03:58.019> version<00:03:58.410> and<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:58.709> reason<00:03:59.040> for<00:03:59.070> that

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
United version and the reason for that

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.370 
United version and the reason for that
is<00:03:59.640> simply<00:04:00.000> because<00:04:00.330> nanny<00:04:00.600> was<00:04:00.930> owned<00:04:01.230> by

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
is simply because nanny was owned by

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.979 
is simply because nanny was owned by
Manchester<00:04:02.040> United<00:04:02.459> and<00:04:02.610> it<00:04:03.299> says<00:04:03.570> loan

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
Manchester United and it says loan

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.650 
Manchester United and it says loan
period<00:04:04.830> exporting<00:04:05.580> kind<00:04:05.820> of<00:04:05.910> run<00:04:06.090> out<00:04:06.269> so<00:04:06.510> that

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
period exporting kind of run out so that

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.020 
period exporting kind of run out so that
means<00:04:06.870> he<00:04:07.500> was<00:04:07.620> originally<00:04:07.920> still<00:04:08.400> a<00:04:08.580> mention

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
means he was originally still a mention

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.030 
means he was originally still a mention
as<00:04:09.299> a<00:04:09.330> player<00:04:09.660> but<00:04:09.690> he<00:04:10.049> actually<00:04:10.200> moved<00:04:10.680> from

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
as a player but he actually moved from

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.500 
as a player but he actually moved from
United's<00:04:11.549> to<00:04:11.730> thinner<00:04:11.970> but<00:04:12.180> you<00:04:12.329> so

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
United's to thinner but you so

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.630 
United's to thinner but you so
technically<00:04:12.989> they<00:04:13.620> could<00:04:13.890> have<00:04:14.010> released<00:04:14.400> a

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
technically they could have released a

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.520 
technically they could have released a
Manchester<00:04:15.239> at<00:04:15.420> 90<00:04:15.750> version<00:04:16.109> but<00:04:16.200> I<00:04:16.260> don't

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
Manchester at 90 version but I don't

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.289 
Manchester at 90 version but I don't
think<00:04:16.739> they<00:04:16.859> have<00:04:17.040> although<00:04:17.820> there's<00:04:18.060> still<00:04:18.269> a

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
think they have although there's still a

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.969 
think they have although there's still a
small<00:04:18.479> chance<00:04:18.600> there's<00:04:19.169> maybe<00:04:19.440> one<00:04:19.739> on<00:04:19.890> the

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
small chance there's maybe one on the

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.949 
small chance there's maybe one on the
market<00:04:20.160> but<00:04:20.609> I<00:04:20.669> think<00:04:21.000> one<00:04:21.150> of<00:04:21.180> the<00:04:21.390> EA<00:04:21.600> deaths

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
market but I think one of the EA deaths

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.080 
market but I think one of the EA deaths
actually<00:04:22.770> said<00:04:22.979> on<00:04:23.070> Twitter<00:04:23.370> that<00:04:23.460> was<00:04:23.789> just<00:04:24.000> a

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
actually said on Twitter that was just a

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.360 
actually said on Twitter that was just a
mistake<00:04:24.210> made<00:04:24.690> by<00:04:24.720> them<00:04:25.110> but<00:04:25.650> you<00:04:25.950> never<00:04:26.160> know

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
mistake made by them but you never know

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.770 
mistake made by them but you never know
maybe<00:04:26.970> someone

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
maybe someone

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.510 
maybe someone
ultimate<00:04:28.080> team<00:04:28.200> actually<00:04:28.410> has<00:04:28.710> one<00:04:28.920> of<00:04:29.040> the<00:04:29.160> 90

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
ultimate team actually has one of the 90

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.220 
ultimate team actually has one of the 90
versions<00:04:29.880> who<00:04:30.030> plays<00:04:30.240> for<00:04:30.420> united<00:04:30.810> because<00:04:30.960> i

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
versions who plays for united because i

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.710 
versions who plays for united because i
know<00:04:31.290> i<00:04:31.650> think<00:04:31.950> if<00:04:32.250> fifa<00:04:32.520> 14<00:04:32.760> that<00:04:33.120> was<00:04:33.300> like<00:04:33.480> a

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
know i think if fifa 14 that was like a

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.360 
know i think if fifa 14 that was like a
version<00:04:33.930> of<00:04:34.200> our<00:04:34.410> now<00:04:34.590> to<00:04:34.650> bitch<00:04:34.950> who<00:04:35.130> played

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
version of our now to bitch who played

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.280 
version of our now to bitch who played
for<00:04:35.580> where<00:04:35.760> the<00:04:35.910> brain<00:04:36.120> even<00:04:36.750> though<00:04:36.990> you<00:04:37.050> move

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
for where the brain even though you move

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.800 
for where the brain even though you move
to<00:04:37.410> stoke<00:04:37.650> city<00:04:37.919> and<00:04:38.160> I<00:04:38.820> think<00:04:39.030> if<00:04:39.120> even<00:04:39.360> 15<00:04:39.690> as

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
to stoke city and I think if even 15 as

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.390 
to stoke city and I think if even 15 as
well<00:04:39.990> there's<00:04:40.200> a<00:04:40.290> Negredo<00:04:40.710> version<00:04:41.160> still

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
well there's a Negredo version still

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.580 
well there's a Negredo version still
place<00:04:41.639> for<00:04:41.940> Manchester<00:04:42.840> City<00:04:43.080> even<00:04:43.470> though

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
place for Manchester City even though

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.460 
place for Manchester City even though
you<00:04:43.650> of<00:04:43.800> course<00:04:44.010> went<00:04:44.970> to<00:04:45.090> Valencia<00:04:45.330> so<00:04:45.870> maybe

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
you of course went to Valencia so maybe

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.500 
you of course went to Valencia so maybe
there's<00:04:46.800> one<00:04:47.040> in<00:04:47.280> an<00:04:47.730> ultimate<00:04:48.150> team<00:04:48.270> and<00:04:48.419> so

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
there's one in an ultimate team and so

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.150 
there's one in an ultimate team and so
it<00:04:48.570> would<00:04:48.690> be<00:04:48.780> pretty<00:04:48.990> sweet<00:04:49.139> but<00:04:49.530> the<00:04:49.830> chances

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
it would be pretty sweet but the chances

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.610 
it would be pretty sweet but the chances
of<00:04:50.280> people<00:04:51.090> backing<00:04:51.300> him<00:04:51.480> now<00:04:51.720> are<00:04:51.990> none

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
of people backing him now are none

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.900 
of people backing him now are none
because<00:04:52.800> I<00:04:53.010> actually<00:04:53.190> managed<00:04:53.580> to<00:04:53.639> get<00:04:53.790> his

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
know in the comments down below what you

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.970 
know in the comments down below what you
think<00:05:06.450> of<00:05:06.600> these<00:05:06.720> transfer<00:05:07.140> players<00:05:07.380> in<00:05:07.830> my

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:07.980 
think of these transfer players in my

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.920 
think of these transfer players in my
opinion<00:05:08.010> anyway<00:05:08.430> it<00:05:08.880> makes<00:05:09.240> ultimate<00:05:09.750> team<00:05:09.900> a

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
opinion anyway it makes ultimate team a

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.720 
opinion anyway it makes ultimate team a
little<00:05:10.230> bit<00:05:10.320> more<00:05:10.530> life<00:05:10.800> because<00:05:11.220> it<00:05:11.490> makes

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:11.730 
little bit more life because it makes

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.700 
little bit more life because it makes
building<00:05:12.330> squats<00:05:12.720> fun<00:05:13.020> again<00:05:13.260> since<00:05:13.560> they're

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
building squats fun again since they're

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.200 
building squats fun again since they're
of<00:05:13.800> course<00:05:14.070> sort<00:05:14.490> of<00:05:14.580> new<00:05:14.820> players<00:05:15.090> and

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
of course sort of new players and

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.820 
of course sort of new players and
ultimate<00:05:15.600> team<00:05:15.810> which<00:05:16.350> I'm<00:05:16.500> really<00:05:16.590> really

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
ultimate team which I'm really really

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.560 
ultimate team which I'm really really
hyped<00:05:17.010> for<00:05:17.130> and<00:05:17.550> these<00:05:17.910> are<00:05:18.030> actually<00:05:18.300> not<00:05:18.419> the

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
hyped for and these are actually not the

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.140 
hyped for and these are actually not the
final<00:05:19.140> five<00:05:19.350> stars<00:05:19.650> killers<00:05:20.010> which<00:05:20.880> actually

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
final five stars killers which actually

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.550 
final five stars killers which actually
moved<00:05:21.570> to<00:05:21.720> a<00:05:21.750> different<00:05:21.990> club<00:05:22.229> because

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
moved to a different club because

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.050 
moved to a different club because
they're<00:05:22.740> actually<00:05:23.040> still<00:05:23.310> a<00:05:23.340> chance<00:05:23.729> of<00:05:23.940> I

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
they're actually still a chance of I

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.570 
they're actually still a chance of I
think<00:05:24.120> ronaldinho<00:05:25.020> making<00:05:25.950> a<00:05:26.010> transfer<00:05:26.430> to<00:05:26.550> a

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
think ronaldinho making a transfer to a

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.920 
think ronaldinho making a transfer to a
different<00:05:26.610> club<00:05:27.090> I'm<00:05:27.360> not<00:05:27.510> really<00:05:27.660> too<00:05:27.900> sure

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
different club I'm not really too sure

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.780 
different club I'm not really too sure
if<00:05:28.139> it's<00:05:28.380> transferred<00:05:28.800> to<00:05:28.950> antalya<00:05:29.490> spores

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790 
if it's transferred to antalya spores

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.610 
if it's transferred to antalya spores
already<00:05:30.210> done<00:05:30.389> if<00:05:30.600> that's<00:05:30.780> the<00:05:30.900> case<00:05:31.080> then<00:05:31.410> he

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
already done if that's the case then he

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.740 
already done if that's the case then he
won't<00:05:31.800> get<00:05:31.950> a<00:05:32.010> new<00:05:32.220> version<00:05:32.460> in<00:05:32.760> fifa15<00:05:33.150> anyway

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
won't get a new version in fifa15 anyway

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.900 
won't get a new version in fifa15 anyway
because<00:05:34.320> I<00:05:34.470> think<00:05:34.830> antalyaspor<00:05:35.250> actually

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
because I think antalyaspor actually

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.210 
because I think antalyaspor actually
played<00:05:36.150> in<00:05:36.180> a<00:05:36.390> second<00:05:36.810> league<00:05:36.990> of<00:05:37.200> Turkey<00:05:38.010> but

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
played in a second league of Turkey but

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:39.800 
played in a second league of Turkey but
they<00:05:38.340> promoted<00:05:38.970> to<00:05:39.030> the<00:05:39.060> first<00:05:39.180> league<00:05:39.600> so<00:05:39.780> he

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
they promoted to the first league so he

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.140 
they promoted to the first league so he
will<00:05:40.110> be<00:05:40.229> in<00:05:40.350> FIFA<00:05:40.560> 16<00:05:40.710> for<00:05:41.100> sure<00:05:41.310> then<00:05:41.970> there's

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
will be in FIFA 16 for sure then there's

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:43.550 
will be in FIFA 16 for sure then there's
one<00:05:42.479> more<00:05:42.720> i<00:05:42.780> think<00:05:43.080> that<00:05:43.169> is<00:05:43.260> Wellington

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
one more i think that is Wellington

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.590 
one more i think that is Wellington
