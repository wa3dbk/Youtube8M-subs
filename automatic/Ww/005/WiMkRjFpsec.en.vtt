coated<00:02:12.709> with<00:02:12.890> zinc<00:02:12.920> in<00:02:13.510> manufacture<00:02:14.510> so

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
coated with zinc in manufacture so

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.899 
coated with zinc in manufacture so
that's<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.080> first<00:02:15.319> layer<00:02:15.560> of<00:02:15.680> protection<00:02:16.129> for

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:16.909 
that's the first layer of protection for

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:20.160 
that's the first layer of protection for
the<00:02:17.030> wires<00:02:17.269> then<00:02:18.080> on<00:02:18.230> top<00:02:18.440> of<00:02:18.650> that<00:02:18.799> we<00:02:19.549> have<00:02:19.700> a

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
the wires then on top of that we have a

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.780 
the wires then on top of that we have a
primer<00:02:21.170> coat<00:02:21.319> this<00:02:21.830> white<00:02:22.099> paint<00:02:22.459> right<00:02:22.760> here

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
primer coat this white paint right here

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.360 
primer coat this white paint right here
that's<00:02:23.599> to<00:02:23.930> hold<00:02:24.049> the<00:02:24.260> subsequent<00:02:24.890> coats<00:02:25.069> to

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
that's to hold the subsequent coats to

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.729 
that's to hold the subsequent coats to
that<00:02:25.519> galvanized<00:02:26.120> surface<00:02:26.569> then<00:02:27.319> comes<00:02:27.590> the

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
that galvanized surface then comes the

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.920 
that galvanized surface then comes the
real<00:02:27.950> working<00:02:28.280> layers<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:29.120> nock<00:02:29.329> side<00:02:29.659> which

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
real working layers the nock side which

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.850 
real working layers the nock side which
is<00:02:30.110> applied<00:02:30.440> in<00:02:30.709> two<00:02:31.370> coats<00:02:32.329> of<00:02:32.860> contrasting

is applied in two coats of contrasting
colors<00:02:34.930> simply<00:02:35.930> so<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.379> painters<00:02:36.739> can<00:02:37.010> see

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
colors simply so the painters can see

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.030 
colors simply so the painters can see
any<00:02:37.879> skips<00:02:38.480> holidays<00:02:39.110> or<00:02:39.409> anything<00:02:39.620> in<00:02:39.890> that

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
any skips holidays or anything in that

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.399 
any skips holidays or anything in that
paint<00:02:40.340> system<00:02:40.819> to<00:02:41.239> make<00:02:41.450> sure<00:02:41.629> they<00:02:41.840> get<00:02:42.110> a

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:42.409 
paint system to make sure they get a

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:44.979 
paint system to make sure they get a
good<00:02:42.769> coat<00:02:43.129> of<00:02:43.310> paint<00:02:43.519> on<00:02:43.730> in<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.510> first<00:02:44.750> coat

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
good coat of paint on in the first coat

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.140 
good coat of paint on in the first coat
that<00:02:45.140> they<00:02:45.260> call<00:02:45.470> blue<00:02:45.709> gray<00:02:46.010> and<00:02:46.310> then<00:02:46.819> on<00:02:46.970> top

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
that they call blue gray and then on top

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.880 
that they call blue gray and then on top
of<00:02:47.209> that<00:02:47.359> goes<00:02:47.690> another<00:02:47.989> coat<00:02:48.260> of<00:02:48.290> noch<00:02:48.590> side

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
of that goes another coat of noch side

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.400 
of that goes another coat of noch side
they<00:02:49.069> referred<00:02:49.400> to<00:02:49.430> as<00:02:49.670> gravel<00:02:50.120> gray<00:02:50.359> and<00:02:50.690> then

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
they referred to as gravel gray and then

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.039 
they referred to as gravel gray and then
comes<00:02:51.769> the<00:02:52.040> acrylic<00:02:52.940> coat<00:02:53.180> on<00:02:53.420> top<00:02:53.510> of<00:02:53.900> that

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
comes the acrylic coat on top of that

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.280 
comes the acrylic coat on top of that
and<00:02:54.319> that's<00:02:54.829> the<00:02:55.129> same<00:02:55.430> system<00:02:56.299> that<00:02:56.959> is<00:02:57.109> on

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
and that's the same system that is on

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.949 
and that's the same system that is on
all<00:02:57.340> suspenders<00:02:58.340> and<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:58.940> main<00:02:59.120> cable<00:02:59.569> itself

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
all suspenders and the main cable itself

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.530 
all suspenders and the main cable itself
which<00:03:00.739> is<00:03:00.920> also<00:03:01.280> composed<00:03:01.700> of<00:03:02.000> galvanized

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
which is also composed of galvanized

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.319 
which is also composed of galvanized
wire<00:03:02.810> with<00:03:03.140> the<00:03:03.290> same<00:03:03.579> paint<00:03:04.579> system<00:03:05.000> on<00:03:05.150> it

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
wire with the same paint system on it

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.390 
wire with the same paint system on it
the<00:03:05.780> only<00:03:06.049> difference<00:03:06.440> with<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:06.709> main<00:03:06.920> cable

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
the only difference with the main cable

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.910 
the only difference with the main cable
is<00:03:07.579> that<00:03:09.700> it<00:03:10.700> gets<00:03:10.970> additional<00:03:11.870> two<00:03:12.290> levels<00:03:12.680> of

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
is that it gets additional two levels of

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.430 
is that it gets additional two levels of
protection<00:03:13.269> isn't<00:03:14.269> that<00:03:14.420> it's<00:03:14.690> coated<00:03:15.049> with<00:03:15.230> a

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
protection isn't that it's coated with a

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.319 
protection isn't that it's coated with a
zinc<00:03:16.190> paste<00:03:16.459> and<00:03:18.430> wrapped<00:03:19.430> with<00:03:19.790> an

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
zinc paste and wrapped with an

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.990 
zinc paste and wrapped with an
additional<00:03:20.930> coating<00:03:21.709> of<00:03:22.010> protective<00:03:22.669> coating

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
additional coating of protective coating

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.659 
additional coating of protective coating
of<00:03:23.120> galvanized<00:03:23.660> wire<00:03:23.930> it's<00:03:24.590> hard<00:03:24.889> work<00:03:25.160> but

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:25.669 
of galvanized wire it's hard work but

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:27.610 
of galvanized wire it's hard work but
not<00:03:26.030> as<00:03:26.150> painstaking<00:03:26.900> as<00:03:27.079> painting<00:03:27.500> the

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
not as painstaking as painting the

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.530 
not as painstaking as painting the
original<00:03:28.099> west<00:03:28.310> ban<00:03:28.549> which<00:03:28.819> was<00:03:29.000> all<00:03:29.150> done<00:03:29.329> by

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
original west ban which was all done by

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:32.359 
the five-step suspender painting has

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:33.759 
the five-step suspender painting has
been<00:03:32.389> automated<00:03:32.959> yeah<00:03:33.470> it's<00:03:33.590> a<00:03:33.650> little

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
been automated yeah it's a little

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.129 
been automated yeah it's a little
cylinder<00:03:34.370> with<00:03:34.609> spray<00:03:35.180> heads<00:03:35.450> on<00:03:35.660> the<00:03:35.780> inside

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.139 
cylinder with spray heads on the inside

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:37.539 
cylinder with spray heads on the inside
of<00:03:36.290> it<00:03:36.410> that<00:03:36.560> they<00:03:36.680> take<00:03:36.859> all<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.190> way<00:03:37.280> up<00:03:37.400> to

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
of it that they take all the way up to

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.270 
of it that they take all the way up to
the<00:03:37.669> top<00:03:38.450> and<00:03:38.690> then<00:03:38.780> it's<00:03:38.930> self<00:03:39.169> powered<00:03:39.650> so

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
the top and then it's self powered so

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.399 
the top and then it's self powered so
that<00:03:40.459> it's<00:03:40.639> a<00:03:40.760> controlled<00:03:41.299> descent<00:03:41.569> at<00:03:41.989> a

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:43.409 
that it's a controlled descent at a

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:46.410 
that it's a controlled descent at a
calculated<00:03:44.409> rate<00:03:44.709> of<00:03:44.950> speed<00:03:45.459> to<00:03:45.909> give<00:03:46.180> them

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
calculated rate of speed to give them

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.410 
calculated rate of speed to give them
the<00:03:46.569> exact<00:03:47.159> thickness<00:03:48.159> of<00:03:48.519> paint<00:03:48.849> laid<00:03:49.150> down

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
the exact thickness of paint laid down

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.929 
the exact thickness of paint laid down
that<00:03:49.480> is<00:03:49.900> required<00:03:50.349> per<00:03:50.980> coat<00:03:51.280> and<00:03:51.670> that's<00:03:51.819> how

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:51.939 
that is required per coat and that's how

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:53.039 
that is required per coat and that's how
they<00:03:52.090> cleaned<00:03:52.390> it<00:03:52.510> as<00:03:52.659> well

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
they cleaned it as well

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:54.869 
they cleaned it as well
instead<00:03:53.590> of<00:03:53.680> having<00:03:53.859> paint<00:03:54.280> heads<00:03:54.549> in<00:03:54.760> the

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:54.879 
instead of having paint heads in the

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.059 
instead of having paint heads in the
cylinders<00:03:55.329> they<00:03:55.810> had<00:03:55.989> spray<00:03:56.319> heads<00:03:56.590> blowing

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
cylinders they had spray heads blowing
