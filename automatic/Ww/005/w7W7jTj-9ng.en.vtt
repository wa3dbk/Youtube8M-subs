00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.010

 Nasty Is it is rude to you auc 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:47.700
 It has already been a long week today 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:50.090
 It's early, if you pass that 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.090
 But 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.930
 Let's get out what poster saturday 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:07.620
 What you want to eat there any requests from patients as its name me the requests 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:15.180
 And to ask you to wind I mean there are a 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:17.990
 This is that once a week that we deliver something as Der patient said. 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.990
 going 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:35.460
 Among patients of that Well painful Toka want to eat there Toka want to eat this situation 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.560
 It is very heavy to say that these words were squeezed down 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.790
 c 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.790
 I think it's important 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.700
 I do not melt the beach 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:56.990
 For sick mu people 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:02:05.140
 I think I'm looking for something I can do 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:05.140
 I think it is also a place where families and patients can return the meal and agree 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:23.219
 Have you killed that little husband with his liver 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:29.810
 But at that time four years ago 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:32.290
 As I was hospitalized and informed of my illness at the same time, there were almost no institutions. 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:36.510
 In the situation that can hardly eat 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.510
 Even though I really loved eating 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:45.250
 I can not eat something I want to eat 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:51.910
 If there is a period to eat a little more 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:53.860
 It would not be a pity if I thought that the faces of both sides would eat 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:59.120
 Host of enemy 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:04.519
 In the usual intermediate form to say I regret of that person 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:06.780
 I went towards the Isubete to patients who say Do I want to say that it was unable at that time now 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.319
 I would like to give 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.319
 think 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:23.180
 There is a lot of confusion when it comes to serving very requested food 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:36.099
 Now that say please say what you like also do 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:37.299
 What it also is said a luxurious meal only is it you are saying that say do not put out even if 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:42.319
 Don't do it 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:45.459
 Sometimes I say that the cost of ingredients will jump 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.459
 Well very difficult 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:15.959
 I want you to enjoy the food and it's here like this. 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:17.930
 That kind of saying 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:23.019
 The is that 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.019
 I have a feeling that I do not want to do a little 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:37.630
 Even a little bit that school 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:40.770
 'M down force Toka Hirono to live 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:50.060
 That's fighting with 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:50.060
 I think that I want it to be a meal that can relieve various hotness
