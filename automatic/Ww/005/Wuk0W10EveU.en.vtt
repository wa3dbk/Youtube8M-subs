instead of using faces and names

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.440 
instead of using faces and names
scientists<00:01:15.450> use<00:01:15.659> symbols<00:01:16.490> squares<00:01:17.490> represent

scientists<00:01:33.630> will<00:01:33.960> then<00:01:34.170> use<00:01:34.439> this

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
scientists will then use this

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.100

showing the recessive trait in our

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.119 
showing the recessive trait in our
example<00:03:53.719> the<00:03:54.139> recessive<00:03:54.439> boy<00:03:54.769> would<00:03:55.099> have

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:55.129 
example the recessive boy would have

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:57.729 
example the recessive boy would have
blonde<00:03:55.549> hair<00:03:55.670> and<00:03:56.090> so<00:03:56.840> what<00:03:56.989> a<00:03:57.019> recessive<00:03:57.379> girl

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
blonde hair and so what a recessive girl

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.640 
blonde hair and so what a recessive girl
and<00:03:58.549> their<00:03:58.700> genes<00:03:59.000> would<00:03:59.239> be<00:03:59.299> -<00:03:59.659> or<00:04:00.049> a<00:04:00.109> case<00:04:00.469> B's

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
and their genes would be - or a case B's

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.809 
and their genes would be - or a case B's
so<00:04:03.650> the<00:04:03.739> next<00:04:03.919> time<00:04:04.129> you<00:04:04.249> look<00:04:04.370> at<00:04:04.549> a<00:04:04.579> family
