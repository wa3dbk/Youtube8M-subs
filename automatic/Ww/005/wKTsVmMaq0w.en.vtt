doing the festival here for three years
I<00:01:40.600> were<00:01:40.810> hopeful<00:01:41.170> that<00:01:41.290> it<00:01:41.440> will<00:01:41.560> grow<00:01:41.740> and

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.310 
I were hopeful that it will grow and
we'll<00:01:42.490> be<00:01:42.640> able<00:01:42.760> to<00:01:43.030> make<00:01:43.300> it<00:01:43.420> a<00:01:43.450> cost<00:01:43.810> neutral

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
we'll be able to make it a cost neutral

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.230 
we'll be able to make it a cost neutral
event<00:01:44.560> so<00:01:44.860> that<00:01:45.010> a<00:01:45.040> local<00:01:45.460> group<00:01:45.729> can<00:01:45.940> take<00:01:46.120> it
