hey<00:00:00.210> guys<00:00:00.390> so<00:00:00.630> today<00:00:00.659> I<00:00:00.989> want<00:00:01.290> to<00:00:01.410> check<00:00:01.709> out

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
hey guys so today I want to check out

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.860 
hey guys so today I want to check out
the<00:00:01.979> speed<00:00:02.340> here<00:00:02.669> of<00:00:02.879> the<00:00:03.120> original<00:00:03.629> Samsung

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
the speed here of the original Samsung

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.900 
the speed here of the original Samsung
Galaxy<00:00:04.410> S<00:00:04.470> 2<00:00:04.680> versus<00:00:05.100> the<00:00:05.220> brand<00:00:05.520> new<00:00:05.700> Galaxy

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
Galaxy S 2 versus the brand new Galaxy

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.520 
Galaxy S 2 versus the brand new Galaxy
core<00:00:06.450> plus<00:00:06.779> smartphone<00:00:09.110> so<00:00:10.110> this<00:00:10.349> could<00:00:10.500> be

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
core plus smartphone so this could be

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.190 
core plus smartphone so this could be
pretty<00:00:10.769> interesting<00:00:11.160> here<00:00:11.309> because<00:00:12.200> the

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
pretty interesting here because the

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.410 
pretty interesting here because the
galaxy's<00:00:13.650> -<00:00:13.860> I<00:00:13.889> mean<00:00:14.190> it's<00:00:14.849> coming<00:00:15.089> down<00:00:15.299> to

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
galaxy's - I mean it's coming down to

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.930 
galaxy's - I mean it's coming down to
price<00:00:15.630> right<00:00:15.809> now<00:00:15.960> pretty<00:00:16.139> hard<00:00:16.760> what<00:00:17.760> this

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
price right now pretty hard what this

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.050 
price right now pretty hard what this
one<00:00:18.119> is<00:00:18.830> probably<00:00:19.830> they<00:00:20.520> could<00:00:20.670> probably<00:00:20.850> all

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
one is probably they could probably all

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.210 
one is probably they could probably all
almost<00:00:21.330> match<00:00:21.630> in<00:00:21.990> terms<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.650> pricing<00:00:23.070> here

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
almost match in terms of pricing here

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.830 
almost match in terms of pricing here
but<00:00:23.670> you<00:00:23.760> can<00:00:23.880> see<00:00:24.000> how<00:00:24.060> quick<00:00:24.449> here<00:00:24.720> the

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
but you can see how quick here the

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.679 
but you can see how quick here the
galaxy<00:00:25.380> s2<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.970> used<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.029> flashing<00:00:27.449> too<00:00:27.570> much

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
galaxy s2 is used to flashing too much

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.890 
galaxy s2 is used to flashing too much
from<00:00:27.840> something<00:00:28.609> so<00:00:29.609> two<00:00:30.119> generations<00:00:30.720> back

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
from something so two generations back

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.680 
from something so two generations back
their<00:00:31.199> galaxy<00:00:31.830> s2<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.610> then<00:00:32.669> galaxy<00:00:33.149> s3<00:00:33.540> and

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
their galaxy s2 and then galaxy s3 and

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.690 
their galaxy s2 and then galaxy s3 and
then<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.899> galaxy<00:00:34.170> s4<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.649> soon<00:00:35.219> probably<00:00:35.340> the

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
then the galaxy s4 and soon probably the

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.010 
then the galaxy s4 and soon probably the
galaxy<00:00:36.030> s5<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.300> going<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.600> come<00:00:36.719> out<00:00:36.840> on<00:00:36.870> the

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
galaxy s5 is going to come out on the

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.060 
galaxy s5 is going to come out on the
market<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:38.000> or<00:00:39.000> maybe<00:00:39.329> not<00:00:39.570> right<00:00:39.809> now<00:00:39.840> but<00:00:40.070> in

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
market so or maybe not right now but in

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.299 
market so or maybe not right now but in
a<00:00:41.190> few<00:00:41.219> months<00:00:41.520> in<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.300> few<00:00:42.450> months<00:00:42.680> this<00:00:43.680> one<00:00:43.980> is

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
a few months in a few months this one is

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.959 
a few months in a few months this one is
a<00:00:44.340> build<00:00:44.730> up<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.239> original<00:00:46.050> Galaxy<00:00:46.260> core

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
a build up of the original Galaxy core

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.760 
a build up of the original Galaxy core
and<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.420> do<00:00:48.539> get<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.930> fresh<00:00:49.350> version<00:00:49.590> of

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
and you do get a fresh version of

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.670 
and you do get a fresh version of
Android<00:00:50.100> here<00:00:50.340> which<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.420> quite<00:00:51.570> nice<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.140> this

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
Android here which is quite nice so this

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.260 
Android here which is quite nice so this
is<00:00:52.860> first<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.190> all<00:00:53.309> take<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.550> look<00:00:53.730> here<00:00:54.120> and

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
is first of all take a look here and

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.660 
is first of all take a look here and
move<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.140> use<00:00:55.320> your<00:00:55.620> core<00:00:55.829> processor<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.399> think

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
move to use your core processor I think

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.720 
move to use your core processor I think
it's<00:00:57.149> also<00:00:57.329> home<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.570> universe<00:00:58.109> here<00:00:58.320> on<00:00:58.530> the

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
it's also home to universe here on the

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.330 
it's also home to universe here on the
galaxies<00:00:59.730> -<00:00:59.879> but<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.510> do<00:01:00.660> get<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:01.170> like<00:01:01.859> policy

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
galaxies - but you do get a like policy

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.539 
galaxies - but you do get a like policy
9<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.579> think<00:01:02.930> so<00:01:03.930> some<00:01:04.860> pretty<00:01:04.979> good<00:01:05.250> stuff

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
9 I think so some pretty good stuff

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:12.200 
9 I think so some pretty good stuff
inside<00:01:06.590> of<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.770> galaxy's<00:01:08.220> -<00:01:10.760> you<00:01:11.760> do<00:01:11.880> get<00:01:12.000> new

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
inside of the galaxy's - you do get new

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.990 
inside of the galaxy's - you do get new
and<00:01:12.390> russian<00:01:12.750> geardo<00:01:13.040> and<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.130> 4.0<00:01:14.430> -<00:01:14.700> you're

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
and russian geardo and a 4.0 - you're

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.730 
and russian geardo and a 4.0 - you're
probably<00:01:15.299> not<00:01:15.570> going<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.780> get<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.110> on<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
probably not going to get that on the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.940 
probably not going to get that on the
galaxy<00:01:17.280> s2<00:01:17.479> maybe<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.720> can<00:01:19.110> maybe<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.770> can

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
galaxy s2 maybe you can maybe you can

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.370 
galaxy s2 maybe you can maybe you can
maybe<00:01:20.159> can<00:01:20.460> but<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.210> don't<00:01:21.540> think<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:22.200> they

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
maybe can but I don't think that they

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.810 
maybe can but I don't think that they
still<00:01:22.650> support<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:24.380> so<00:01:25.380> do<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.650> go<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.670> can

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
still support it so do you go you can

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.280 
still support it so do you go you can
see<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.360> version<00:01:28.320> there<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:30.110> can't<00:01:31.110> like<00:01:31.259> it

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
see the version there I can't like it

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.810 
see the version there I can't like it
that<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.619> do<00:01:31.740> get<00:01:31.950> two<00:01:32.100> vibrations<00:01:32.549> here<00:01:32.700> on

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
that you do get two vibrations here on

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.710 
that you do get two vibrations here on
the<00:01:32.880> buttons<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.540> don't<00:01:34.200> feel<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.799> here<00:01:35.420> on<00:01:36.420> this

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
the buttons I don't feel it here on this

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.210 
the buttons I don't feel it here on this
phone<00:01:36.960> which<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.380> left<00:01:37.710> weird<00:01:39.799> but<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:40.829> do<00:01:40.950> like

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
phone which is left weird but I do like

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.770 
phone which is left weird but I do like
the<00:01:41.400> new<00:01:41.549> layout<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.390> kind<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.630> looks

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
the new layout that it kind of looks

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.910 
the new layout that it kind of looks
like<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.960> galaxy<00:01:43.350> s4<00:01:44.060> and<00:01:45.350> you<00:01:46.350> can<00:01:46.500> kind<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.740> see

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
like a galaxy s4 and you can kind of see

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.960 
like a galaxy s4 and you can kind of see
that<00:01:47.040> if<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.340> go<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.549> display<00:01:49.520> show<00:01:50.520> batter<00:01:50.790> up

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
that if I go to display show batter up

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.090 
that if I go to display show batter up
Santa<00:01:51.299> tracker<00:01:51.540> they<00:01:51.750> get<00:01:51.930> little<00:01:52.049> thing<00:01:52.320> it

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
Santa tracker they get little thing it

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.649 
Santa tracker they get little thing it
kind<00:01:53.369> of<00:01:53.399> likes<00:01:53.579> in<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.909> menus<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.299> little<00:01:54.570> bit

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
kind of likes in the menus a little bit

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.380 
kind of likes in the menus a little bit
compared<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.259> galaxy<00:01:55.770> s2<00:01:59.030> this<00:02:00.030> one<00:02:00.210> is

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
compared to the galaxy s2 this one is

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.030 
compared to the galaxy s2 this one is
butter<00:02:00.659> smooth

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.410 

but<00:02:07.040> it<00:02:07.280> doesn't<00:02:07.640> seem<00:02:07.820> like<00:02:08.030> you<00:02:08.149> can<00:02:08.300> have

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
but it doesn't seem like you can have

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.820 
but it doesn't seem like you can have

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
pretty quick into speed in terms of

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.220 
pretty quick into speed in terms of
