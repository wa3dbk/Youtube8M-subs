kind<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.949> state<00:00:28.949> back<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:30.000> something<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.390> bit

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
kind of state back to something a bit

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.479 
kind of state back to something a bit
more<00:00:30.750> like<00:00:31.410> this<00:00:33.530> really<00:00:34.530> nice<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.040> smooth<00:00:35.250> I

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
more like this really nice and smooth I

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.950 
more like this really nice and smooth I
mean<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:36.030> might<00:00:36.210> look<00:00:36.360> like<00:00:36.420> this<00:00:36.690> scratched

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960

mean it might look like this scratched
here<00:00:37.200> but<00:00:37.410> these<00:00:37.530> are<00:00:37.590> really<00:00:37.890> just<00:00:38.040> chips<00:00:38.670> and

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
here but these are really just chips and

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.610 
here but these are really just chips and
chunks<00:00:39.390> like<00:00:39.540> little<00:00:39.809> chunks<00:00:40.110> taken<00:00:40.260> out<00:00:40.500> from

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
chunks like little chunks taken out from

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.380 
chunks like little chunks taken out from
where<00:00:40.829> they've<00:00:41.579> been<00:00:41.610> around<00:00:41.879> on<00:00:42.059> concrete

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
where they've been around on concrete

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.990 
where they've been around on concrete
and<00:00:42.660> uneven<00:00:43.200> ground<00:00:43.350> stuff<00:00:43.680> but<00:00:44.309> they<00:00:44.850> are

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
and uneven ground stuff but they are

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.990 
and uneven ground stuff but they are
really<00:00:45.750> really<00:00:46.230> smooth<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.680> mean<00:00:47.000> they're

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
really really smooth I mean they're

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.119 
really really smooth I mean they're
perfectly<00:00:48.899> smooth<00:00:49.350> as<00:00:49.559> hell<00:00:49.710> they're<00:00:50.039> not

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
perfectly smooth as hell they're not

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.639 
perfectly smooth as hell they're not
gotta<00:00:50.280> drop<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:50.730> one's<00:00:50.879> car<00:00:51.000> for<00:00:51.149> anything

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
gotta drop in one's car for anything

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.639 
gotta drop in one's car for anything
so<00:00:53.489> basically<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.570> what<00:00:54.719> I've<00:00:54.960> already

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
so basically this is what I've already

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.340 
so basically this is what I've already
started<00:00:56.100> working<00:00:56.699> on<00:00:57.000> each<00:00:57.449> wheel<00:00:57.750> takes<00:00:58.050> well

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
started working on each wheel takes well

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.010 
started working on each wheel takes well
it<00:00:58.530> takes<00:00:58.680> me<00:00:58.800> about<00:00:59.480> 5-10<00:01:00.480> minutes<00:01:00.510> depending

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
it takes me about 5-10 minutes depending

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.850 
it takes me about 5-10 minutes depending
on<00:01:01.109> how<00:01:01.350> bad<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.870> but<00:01:03.870> they're<00:01:04.019> going<00:01:04.290> from<00:01:04.530> you

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
on how bad is but they're going from you

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.359 
on how bad is but they're going from you
know<00:01:05.000> sort<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.020> serve<00:01:07.470> it's

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
know sort of that to that serve it's

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.670 
know sort of that to that serve it's
worth<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.960> it's<00:01:09.960> not<00:01:10.020> really<00:01:10.229> long<00:01:10.470> really

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
worth it it's not really long really

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.500 
worth it it's not really long really
when<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:10.979> really<00:01:11.280> think<00:01:11.310> about<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.700> well<00:01:12.420> you

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
when you really think about it well you

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.020 
when you really think about it well you
need<00:01:12.689> simply<00:01:13.080> as<00:01:13.290> your<00:01:13.470> wheels<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.520> space

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
need simply as your wheels and a space

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.539 
need simply as your wheels and a space
of<00:01:15.180> carpet<00:01:15.509> simple<00:01:16.320> as<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:17.130> see<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.310> line

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
of carpet simple as that you see a line

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.630 
of carpet simple as that you see a line
here<00:01:17.790> from<00:01:18.119> where<00:01:18.270> I've<00:01:18.360> been<00:01:18.390> doing<00:01:19.350> mother

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
here from where I've been doing mother

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.730 
here from where I've been doing mother
it's<00:01:20.640> just<00:01:20.790> plastic<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.600> wipes<00:01:21.840> away<00:01:21.960> just<00:01:22.560> a

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
it's just plastic it wipes away just a

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.859 
it's just plastic it wipes away just a
very<00:01:22.979> ugly<00:01:23.040> finish

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
very ugly finish

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.960 
very ugly finish
I'll<00:01:25.740> show<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:25.979> basically<00:01:26.340> how<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.549> do<00:01:26.850> it

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
I'll show you basically how to do it

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.609 
I'll show you basically how to do it
quickly<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:28.549> the<00:01:29.549> outside<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.600> tire<00:01:30.750> this

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
quickly is the outside of the tire this

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.510 
quickly is the outside of the tire this
edge<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.610> better<00:01:32.790> side<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.240> hasn't<00:01:33.509> got<00:01:33.630> any

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
edge the better side it hasn't got any

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.190 
edge the better side it hasn't got any
isn't<00:01:35.520> really<00:01:35.700> rubbing<00:01:35.970> on<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.119> ground<00:01:36.329> if

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
isn't really rubbing on the ground if

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.390 
isn't really rubbing on the ground if
you're<00:01:37.350> running<00:01:37.439> camber<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.130> know<00:01:38.250> that

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
you're running camber and you know that

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.100 
you're running camber and you know that
as<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.640> can<00:01:38.790> tell<00:01:38.939> I<00:01:38.970> ran<00:01:39.540> some<00:01:39.689> camera<00:01:40.020> on

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
as you can tell I ran some camera on

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.140 
as you can tell I ran some camera on
these<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:41.130> there's<00:01:41.310> more<00:01:41.460> wear<00:01:41.670> on<00:01:41.700> one<00:01:41.850> side

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
these so there's more wear on one side

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.520 
these so there's more wear on one side
than<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.390> other<00:01:42.420> side<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.140> has<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.259> less

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
than the other side that has the less

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.190 
than the other side that has the less
wear<00:01:43.740> or<00:01:44.430> get<00:01:45.180> more<00:01:45.329> polished<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.750> smoother

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
wear or get more polished and smoother

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.499 
wear or get more polished and smoother
quicker<00:01:46.790> the<00:01:47.790> side<00:01:47.939> with<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.180> wear<00:01:48.329> on<00:01:48.360> it

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
quicker the side with the wear on it

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.780 
quicker the side with the wear on it
will<00:01:48.600> take<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.750> bit<00:01:48.899> longer<00:01:48.930> but<00:01:49.829> that's

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
will take a bit longer but that's

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:51.520 
will take a bit longer but that's
understandable

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
understandable

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.740 
understandable

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.859 
spaced carpet hold onto it and you want
to<00:01:58.979> find<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.219> spot<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.640> want<00:01:59.820> to<00:01:59.939> sort

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
to find the spot that you want to sort

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.990 
to find the spot that you want to sort
of<00:02:00.930> rub<00:02:01.110> down<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:01.469> see<00:02:01.680> this<00:02:02.399> section<00:02:02.790> here

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
of rub down so see this section here

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.149 
of rub down so see this section here
right<00:02:03.930> so<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.380> turn<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.710> round<00:02:04.799> so<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.070> have

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
right so you turn it round so you have

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.240 
right so you turn it round so you have
that<00:02:05.340> section<00:02:05.659> well<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.930> think<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:07.950> simply

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
that section well I think you simply

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.609 
that section well I think you simply
it's<00:02:08.459> like<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.640> motion<00:02:09.330> like<00:02:09.629> this<00:02:09.810> but<00:02:10.200> whilst

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
it's like a motion like this but whilst

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.050 
it's like a motion like this but whilst
we're<00:02:10.890> back<00:02:11.099> with<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.310> floors<00:02:11.489> well<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.940> want

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
we're back with the floors well you want

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.030 
we're back with the floors well you want
to<00:02:12.090> apply<00:02:12.420> pressure<00:02:12.780> into<00:02:13.170> it<00:02:13.260> on<00:02:13.410> stuff

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
to apply pressure into it on stuff

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.630 
to apply pressure into it on stuff
at<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.090> same<00:02:15.210> time<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.930> then<00:02:16.800> do<00:02:17.370> it<00:02:17.460> a<00:02:17.490> few

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
at the same time and then do it a few

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.930 
at the same time and then do it a few
times<00:02:17.700> but<00:02:18.240> you<00:02:18.480> have<00:02:18.600> 10-15<00:02:19.110> seconds<00:02:19.850> turn<00:02:20.850> it

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
times but you have 10-15 seconds turn it

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.700 
times but you have 10-15 seconds turn it
over<00:02:21.030> you'll<00:02:21.330> see<00:02:21.480> it's<00:02:21.630> like<00:02:21.750> a<00:02:21.780> dust<00:02:22.080> so<00:02:22.620> up

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
over you'll see it's like a dust so up

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.940 
over you'll see it's like a dust so up
like<00:02:22.860> that<00:02:23.010> so<00:02:23.550> I<00:02:23.580> have<00:02:24.210> just<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:25.350> little<00:02:25.380> dolly

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
like that so I have just a little dolly

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.730 
like that so I have just a little dolly
type<00:02:26.340> towel<00:02:26.760> thing<00:02:27.060> here<00:02:27.270> so<00:02:27.930> I<00:02:28.230> can<00:02:28.590> pass

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
type towel thing here so I can pass

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.160 
type towel thing here so I can pass
pounds<00:02:29.100> of<00:02:29.250> sodium<00:02:29.550> usually<00:02:30.000> just<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:33.450> as<00:02:34.050> you

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
pounds of sodium usually just and as you

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.490 
pounds of sodium usually just and as you
can<00:02:34.260> see<00:02:34.610> it's<00:02:35.610> already<00:02:35.960> going<00:02:36.960> back<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.350> move

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
can see it's already going back to move

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.330 
can see it's already going back to move
on<00:02:38.490> those<00:02:38.730> sections<00:02:39.590> just<00:02:40.590> continuously<00:02:41.100> fit

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
on those sections just continuously fit

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.610 
on those sections just continuously fit
around<00:02:41.430> around<00:02:41.790> around<00:02:42.290> over<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:43.350> over<00:02:43.470> and

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
around around around over and over and

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.900 
around around around over and over and
over<00:02:43.650> again<00:02:44.660> until<00:02:45.660> you<00:02:46.230> guys<00:02:46.710> from<00:02:46.950> this<00:02:47.550> load

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
over again until you guys from this load

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:58.870 
over again until you guys from this load
off<00:02:48.150> this<00:02:48.720> look<00:02:48.990> to<00:02:49.620> basically<00:02:49.920> look<00:02:57.140> like

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
off this look to basically look like

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.910 
off this look to basically look like
instantly<00:02:59.930> smoother<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:01.350> then<00:03:01.590> eventually

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
instantly smoother and then eventually

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.960 
instantly smoother and then eventually
you<00:03:02.310> will<00:03:02.610> end<00:03:02.760> up<00:03:02.820> like<00:03:02.910> that<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:04.970> basically

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
you will end up like that and basically

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.920 
you will end up like that and basically
do<00:03:06.270> is<00:03:06.390> you<00:03:06.420> give<00:03:07.020> up<00:03:07.110> a<00:03:07.170> ball<00:03:07.320> for<00:03:07.530> wheels<00:03:07.800> and

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
do is you give up a ball for wheels and

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:20.590 
do is you give up a ball for wheels and
then<00:03:09.930> yeah<00:03:11.780> okay<00:03:12.830> that's<00:03:13.830> three<00:03:14.100> down<00:03:15.980> to<00:03:19.160> zero

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
then yeah okay that's three down to zero

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.620 
then yeah okay that's three down to zero
I<00:03:22.610> must<00:03:23.610> give<00:03:23.730> you<00:03:23.820> a<00:03:23.850> warning<00:03:24.060> it<00:03:24.240> does<00:03:24.450> do

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
I must give you a warning it does do

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:25.790 
I must give you a warning it does do
your<00:03:24.780> hands<00:03:24.960> in<00:03:25.110> a<00:03:25.170> bit<00:03:25.320> but<00:03:25.470> I<00:03:25.500> don't<00:03:25.560> know<00:03:25.710> if

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
your hands in a bit but I don't know if

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.880 
your hands in a bit but I don't know if
you<00:03:25.890> can<00:03:25.980> see<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.640> red<00:03:26.820> parts<00:03:27.210> of<00:03:27.330> Hamzah

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
you can see the the red parts of Hamzah

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.730 
you can see the the red parts of Hamzah
because<00:03:29.360> the<00:03:30.360> harder<00:03:30.690> you<00:03:30.780> hold<00:03:30.960> it<00:03:31.140> for<00:03:31.560> more

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 
because the harder you hold it for more

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.840 
because the harder you hold it for more
hurts<00:03:32.010> basically<00:03:32.460> and<00:03:33.180> I<00:03:34.280> think<00:03:35.280> that's<00:03:35.550> fair

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
hurts basically and I think that's fair

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.400 
hurts basically and I think that's fair
to<00:03:36.000> say<00:03:36.180> I<00:03:36.210> have<00:03:36.660> a<00:03:36.690> blister<00:03:37.020> on<00:03:37.580> my<00:03:38.580> finger

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
right there somewhere as I'm holding it

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.550 
right there somewhere as I'm holding it
it's<00:03:43.980> rubbing<00:03:44.250> on<00:03:44.340> my<00:03:44.490> finger<00:03:44.850> there<00:03:45.410> so<00:03:46.410> that

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
it's rubbing on my finger there so that

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:53.930 
it's rubbing on my finger there so that
it's<00:03:47.280> bare<00:03:47.430> foot<00:03:47.550> warning<00:03:47.880> look<00:03:48.780> out<00:03:48.930> for<00:03:52.940> I

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
it's bare foot warning look out for I

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.300 
it's bare foot warning look out for I
know<00:03:54.720> it's<00:03:54.930> there<00:03:55.110> sort<00:03:55.410> of<00:03:55.470> thing<00:03:55.590> but<00:03:55.980> yeah

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
know it's there sort of thing but yeah

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.050 
know it's there sort of thing but yeah
this<00:03:57.090> is<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.270> last<00:03:57.450> one<00:03:57.660> though

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
this is the last one though

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.060 
this is the last one though
other<00:04:00.060> advisors<00:04:00.540> more<00:04:00.720> is<00:04:00.870> that<00:04:00.900> you<00:04:01.740> find<00:04:01.980> a

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
other advisors more is that you find a

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.580 
other advisors more is that you find a
relatively<00:04:02.490> clear<00:04:03.210> spot<00:04:03.600> because<00:04:03.870> if<00:04:03.990> you<00:04:04.140> if

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
relatively clear spot because if you if

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.430 
relatively clear spot because if you if
you<00:04:04.710> go<00:04:04.830> on<00:04:04.860> a<00:04:04.980> bit<00:04:05.190> carpet<00:04:05.430> has<00:04:05.730> like<00:04:05.940> some

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
you go on a bit carpet has like some

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.140 
you go on a bit carpet has like some
little<00:04:07.440> something<00:04:07.740> on<00:04:07.800> the<00:04:07.860> floor<00:04:08.070> you<00:04:08.730> tented

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
little something on the floor you tented

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
little something on the floor you tented
you're<00:04:09.480> probably<00:04:09.630> just<00:04:09.780> gonna<00:04:09.900> end<00:04:10.050> up

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
you're probably just gonna end up

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.000 
you're probably just gonna end up
scratching<00:04:10.380> this<00:04:10.650> anymore

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
scratching this anymore

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.180 
scratching this anymore
like<00:04:11.340> more<00:04:11.550> that<00:04:11.730> is<00:04:12.050> because<00:04:13.050> the<00:04:13.890> more<00:04:14.040> you

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
like more that is because the more you

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.770 
like more that is because the more you
do<00:04:14.310> this<00:04:14.490> the<00:04:14.550> more<00:04:15.030> warms<00:04:15.390> up<00:04:15.540> and<00:04:15.690> the

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
do this the more warms up and the

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.420 
do this the more warms up and the
software<00:04:16.109> it's<00:04:16.230> gonna<00:04:16.350> get<00:04:16.560> sort<00:04:16.890> of<00:04:16.950> more

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
software it's gonna get sort of more

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.580 
software it's gonna get sort of more
likely<00:04:17.790> is<00:04:18.030> gonna<00:04:18.209> just<00:04:18.720> scratch<00:04:18.989> more<00:04:19.260> off<00:04:19.350> so

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
likely is gonna just scratch more off so

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.890

detective<00:05:49.890> do<00:05:50.070> you<00:05:51.650> do<00:05:52.650> this<00:05:52.800> and<00:05:53.450> yeah<00:05:54.450> as<00:05:54.630> you

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 
detective do you do this and yeah as you

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.330 
detective do you do this and yeah as you
can<00:05:54.750> see<00:05:54.870> I<00:05:55.230> mean<00:05:57.170> that<00:05:58.170> is<00:05:58.440> basically<00:05:59.160> the

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
can see I mean that is basically the

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:00.800 
can see I mean that is basically the
only<00:05:59.400> way<00:05:59.640> I<00:05:59.670> figured<00:06:00.120> out<00:06:00.180> how<00:06:00.300> to<00:06:00.360> do<00:06:00.570> it<00:06:00.660> I

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810 
only way I figured out how to do it I

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.540 
only way I figured out how to do it I
mean<00:06:00.930> there's<00:06:01.200> other<00:06:01.560> ways<00:06:01.680> to<00:06:01.740> do<00:06:02.040> it<00:06:02.070> it

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
mean there's other ways to do it it

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.120 
mean there's other ways to do it it
might<00:06:02.700> take<00:06:02.910> longer<00:06:02.940> may<00:06:03.480> be<00:06:03.540> quicker<00:06:03.810> even

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.130 
might take longer may be quicker even

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.440 
might take longer may be quicker even
but<00:06:05.130> this<00:06:05.670> needs<00:06:05.820> to<00:06:05.850> be<00:06:05.910> the<00:06:06.000> most<00:06:06.150> effective

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.450 
but this needs to be the most effective

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:08.930 
but this needs to be the most effective
way<00:06:06.690> that<00:06:06.810> I<00:06:07.050> have<00:06:07.230> found<00:06:07.470> to<00:06:07.560> do<00:06:07.740> it<00:06:07.910> with<00:06:08.910> no

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
way that I have found to do it with no

but this is the way I found to do it if

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.780 
but this is the way I found to do it if
it<00:06:28.590> works<00:06:28.740> for<00:06:28.860> you<00:06:28.950> great<00:06:29.100> I<00:06:29.370> mean<00:06:29.610> if<00:06:29.700> it

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:29.790 
it works for you great I mean if it

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.250 
it works for you great I mean if it
doesn't<00:06:29.880> I<00:06:30.060> mean<00:06:30.150> it<00:06:30.270> just<00:06:30.390> takes<00:06:30.480> a<00:06:30.720> bit<00:06:30.900> of<00:06:30.930> a

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:31.260 
doesn't I mean it just takes a bit of a

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.050 
doesn't I mean it just takes a bit of a
little<00:06:31.560> bit<00:06:31.680> of<00:06:31.770> affecting<00:06:32.340> really<00:06:32.580> just<00:06:32.940> to

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
little bit of affecting really just to

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.970 
little bit of affecting really just to
get<00:06:33.180> rid<00:06:33.300> of<00:06:33.450> little<00:06:34.260> bits<00:06:34.530> that<00:06:34.650> you<00:06:34.740> don't

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:34.980 
get rid of little bits that you don't

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.500 
get rid of little bits that you don't
want<00:06:35.160> on<00:06:35.610> your<00:06:35.760> wheels<00:06:35.910> I<00:06:36.060> mean<00:06:36.210> you<00:06:36.270> can<00:06:36.390> even

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:36.510
