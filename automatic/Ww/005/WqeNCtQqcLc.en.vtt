 took a magazine magazine at an advertising agency weighted at 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.089
 we are still many network companies 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:12.849
 many 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:16.199
 old photos of old guard networks new photos in the new guard 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:18.439
 many people 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.909
 it must be said that the first part is simple selection both for them and for why yes 

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:23.550
 proposes why 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.880
 who proposes 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.319
 often it has no material 

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:29.589
 sufficient height difference 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:33.750
 but if it happens on 100 that are proposed 80 are not much of a ne 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.109
 there are always 20 that are really smart 

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:37.370
 calls for material 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.600
 validated 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.970
 none of these interlocutors advertising outbreaks

 vc10 eat photo presents therefore do not wear out 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.490
 so the choice eventually ends up falling on more emotional elements than 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.480
 it is rationality rationally remove who is not able to do you work the 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.910
 work that is required 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.160
 emotionally choose something that hits you instead 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.750
 what does it mean 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:03.859
 in the first place 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:07.560
 if you present any customer, you need to have something that the customer 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.229
 interested 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:09.550
 so that interests him 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.550
 so if the portfolio is a beautiful sea portfolio 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.880
 sum of the wonderful things of your work and that's it, and don't touch the ropes 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.630
 customer 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.860
 this is a big disadvantage 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.350
 to make the thing more effective to the eyes and customer should be done in 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.270
