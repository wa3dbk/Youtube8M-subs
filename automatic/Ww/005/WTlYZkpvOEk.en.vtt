00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.669 
hey I want some embryos I want some more
of<00:00:19.609> you<00:00:19.759> want<00:00:19.909> some<00:00:20.060> adults<00:00:20.480> we<00:00:21.259> can<00:00:21.289> do<00:00:21.560> the

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:21.679 
of you want some adults we can do the

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:23.470 
of you want some adults we can do the
breedings<00:00:22.099> we<00:00:22.310> can<00:00:22.490> make<00:00:22.669> that<00:00:22.880> those

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
breedings we can make that those

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.689 
breedings we can make that those
resources<00:00:23.989> and<00:00:24.259> ship<00:00:24.529> them<00:00:24.710> out<00:00:24.800> nationally

may one day help people with spinal cord
and<00:00:51.530> limb<00:00:51.680> injuries<00:00:51.950> then<00:00:52.910> I<00:00:52.940> have<00:00:53.360> NIH

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230

development<00:00:58.190> work<00:00:58.820> and<00:00:59.060> so<00:00:59.510> the<00:00:59.720> salamander

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
development work and so the salamander

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.890 
development work and so the salamander
has<00:01:00.710> a<00:01:00.770> very<00:01:01.130> large<00:01:01.340> genome<00:01:01.850> it's<00:01:02.120> a<00:01:02.210> order<00:01:02.870> of

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.900 
has a very large genome it's a order of

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.540 
has a very large genome it's a order of

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
single chromosomes one at a time and so

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.180 
single chromosomes one at a time and so
our<00:01:26.120> first<00:01:26.510> set<00:01:27.020> of<00:01:27.170> chromosomes<00:01:27.530> are<00:01:27.950> being

funding<00:01:31.549> us<00:01:31.729> on<00:01:31.970> three<00:01:32.299> different<00:01:32.479> projects

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
funding us on three different projects

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.520 
funding us on three different projects
and<00:01:33.409> one<00:01:33.830> is<00:01:34.100> a<00:01:35.000> project<00:01:35.270> to<00:01:35.570> describe<00:01:36.140> how

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
and one is a project to describe how

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.789 
and one is a project to describe how
limb<00:01:37.070> regeneration<00:01:37.600> actually<00:01:38.600> works<00:01:39.020> what<00:01:39.710> we

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
limb regeneration actually works what we

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.730 
limb regeneration actually works what we
call<00:01:39.950> an<00:01:40.040> RNA<00:01:40.549> level<00:01:40.970> and<00:01:41.210> so<00:01:41.570> genes<00:01:42.350> are

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
call an RNA level and so genes are

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.250 
call an RNA level and so genes are
initially<00:01:43.130> transcribed<00:01:43.880> into<00:01:44.240> RNA<00:01:44.270> and<00:01:44.840> RNA

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.310 
initially transcribed into RNA and RNA
is<00:01:45.830> then<00:01:46.159> translated<00:01:46.580> into<00:01:46.940> protein<00:01:47.540> what

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
is then translated into protein what
