00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.290
 the tendency of I 'm on the floor when I am 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.240
 plan and stop blowing then 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.510
 to offset the trend it stops 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.100
 to say sofia in the plan is like 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.980
 when the concept is strong 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.230
 the tendency I work in works 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.320
 this way I also think about doing 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:24.220
 to close to close from above to do 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.220
 a little this movement 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.040
 going to look for not the sound quality 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.270
 and not in the moment serves to learn to 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.300
 understand perte have the perception 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.300
 understand what to work on 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.270
 that's when I stop 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:04.739
 blow sound this way by biting 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:07.680
 pushing so much air I take off the air I take off 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.570
 the amount of air without changing the 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.750
 heart size the direction is the 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.610
 sound sisport influences by force of 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.229
 things I have to work here because I have to 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.259
 give different direction in the air 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.600
 low notes average notes high notes ok and then 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.040
 He is always here conceded the idea and 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.899
 base note I think ahead because if 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.820
 I think nearby, crush it and go 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.350
 down intonation the high note does not 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.570
 I can think in super that if I think about it 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.850
 up it already clears and grows in the 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.890
 flute clears the tip and pardon 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.750
 known of the stamp for the core of the 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.909
 sound and intonation goes to the stars 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.380
 so I owe the eighth balata I owe it 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.640
 think down 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.520
 it's not that I have to think of it crushed 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.770
 inside I have to think spingo is 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.869
 held here did not have a note there 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.429
 I think low forwards though 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.830
 crush it in to project it 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:53.630
 away proof I don't even have to cover 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.040
 the money pole 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.840
 I do for the low because it is for 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.210
 founding lips lost speed 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.250
 air and then this to return to 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.229
 hit the concept the concept and the 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.750
 air speed not the amount of 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.869
 air the air speed allows us 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.030
 to check the pitch 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:15.380
 mainly the management allows us 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.989
 to vary the direction of the quantity there 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.530
 gives so much air or the floor so much air 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:26.680
 sound less air less basic sound one 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:29.630
 what the base support the puff you push 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.769
 sofia blows on the floor like when i am 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.690
 in fort designed as you wish 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.099
 it's about not missing speed 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.590
 the pressure the air speed 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.150
 when there are precisely plan for me i 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.130
 three fundamental concepts are those 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.730
 then instead it is always easy 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.730
 very hard
