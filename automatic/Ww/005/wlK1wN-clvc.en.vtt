00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
five times a level so you have to do

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.920 
five times a level so you have to do
something<00:01:07.350> else<00:01:07.740> like<00:01:07.920> level<00:01:08.430> sneak<00:01:08.760> or<00:01:09.090> level

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
get skill kind of fast of course it

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.970 
get skill kind of fast of course it
takes<00:02:52.310> your<00:02:52.579> arrows<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:53.620> its<00:02:54.620> really

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
takes your arrows and its really

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.429 
takes your arrows and its really
annoying<00:02:55.250> you<00:02:55.819> just<00:02:56.000> have<00:02:56.150> to<00:02:56.180> run<00:02:56.930> around<00:02:57.079> and

00:02:57.429 --> 00:02:57.439 
annoying you just have to run around and

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:59.589 
annoying you just have to run around and
shoot<00:02:57.739> these<00:02:57.920> guys<00:02:58.220> but<00:02:58.489> it's<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.209> best<00:02:59.239> way

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
shoot these guys but it's the best way

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.770 
shoot these guys but it's the best way
that<00:02:59.750> I<00:02:59.870> could<00:03:00.049> find<00:03:00.319> cuz<00:03:00.889> I<00:03:01.599> think<00:03:02.599> there's

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
that I could find cuz I think there's

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.210 
that I could find cuz I think there's
one<00:03:02.840> other<00:03:03.349> that<00:03:04.129> trains<00:03:05.090> you<00:03:05.359> in<00:03:05.569> archery<00:03:06.220> but

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
one other that trains you in archery but

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.929 
one other that trains you in archery but
even<00:03:08.090> if<00:03:08.239> you<00:03:08.359> get<00:03:08.569> her<00:03:08.810> as<00:03:09.079> a<00:03:09.109> companion<00:03:09.590> oh<00:03:10.040> no

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:10.939 
even if you get her as a companion oh no

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:12.960 
even if you get her as a companion oh no
no<00:03:11.090> you<00:03:11.150> can't<00:03:11.569> get<00:03:11.750> her<00:03:11.870> as<00:03:12.019> companion<00:03:12.620> I

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
no you can't get her as companion I

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.449 
no you can't get her as companion I
think<00:03:13.970> but<00:03:14.510> if<00:03:14.750> you<00:03:14.840> marry<00:03:15.109> her<00:03:15.470> you<00:03:15.769> can<00:03:16.040> train

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
think but if you marry her you can train

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.559 
think but if you marry her you can train
with<00:03:16.489> her<00:03:16.940> it's<00:03:17.690> really<00:03:18.079> weird<00:03:19.329> so<00:03:20.329> it's<00:03:20.510> like

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
with her it's really weird so it's like

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.240 
with her it's really weird so it's like
if<00:03:20.870> yeah<00:03:21.590> I<00:03:21.620> don't<00:03:21.829> really<00:03:22.040> know<00:03:22.370> what's

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
if yeah I don't really know what's

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.699 
if yeah I don't really know what's
what's<00:03:25.250> the<00:03:25.609> glitch<00:03:26.599> or<00:03:26.840> maybe<00:03:27.079> they<00:03:27.230> fixed<00:03:27.500> it

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
what's the glitch or maybe they fixed it

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.189 
what's the glitch or maybe they fixed it
i<00:03:27.889> don't<00:03:28.069> know<00:03:28.159> if<00:03:28.310> it's<00:03:28.489> it<00:03:28.909> worked<00:03:29.449> before<00:03:29.659> at

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:30.199 
i don't know if it's it worked before at

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:34.300 
i don't know if it's it worked before at
least<00:03:30.440> it<00:03:30.590> doesn't<00:03:30.739> work<00:03:31.010> anymore<00:03:31.280> and<00:03:33.310> so

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
least it doesn't work anymore and so

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.159 
least it doesn't work anymore and so
basically<00:03:34.819> you<00:03:34.940> just<00:03:34.970> go<00:03:35.329> around<00:03:35.449> and<00:03:35.780> kill

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:36.169 
basically you just go around and kill

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:38.530 
basically you just go around and kill
these<00:03:36.579> and<00:03:37.579> you<00:03:37.669> can<00:03:37.790> see<00:03:37.940> right<00:03:38.090> now<00:03:38.269> i'm

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
these and you can see right now i'm

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.569 
these and you can see right now i'm
using<00:03:38.569> daedric<00:03:39.260> arrows<00:03:39.590> which<00:03:40.129> is<00:03:40.310> a<00:03:40.340> very

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
using daedric arrows which is a very

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:43.719 
using daedric arrows which is a very
stupid<00:03:40.879> idea<00:03:41.329> cuz<00:03:42.040> they're<00:03:43.040> kind<00:03:43.370> of<00:03:43.459> hard<00:03:43.609> to

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:43.729 
stupid idea cuz they're kind of hard to

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:47.680 
stupid idea cuz they're kind of hard to
find<00:03:44.090> and<00:03:44.919> it<00:03:45.919> takes<00:03:46.220> kind<00:03:46.609> of<00:03:46.729> a<00:03:46.819> long<00:03:47.030> time<00:03:47.449> to

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
find and it takes kind of a long time to

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.140 
find and it takes kind of a long time to
get<00:03:47.870> those<00:03:48.049> daedric<00:03:48.590> arrows<00:03:48.979> from<00:03:49.729> doing<00:03:50.030> the

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
get those daedric arrows from doing the

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.920 
get those daedric arrows from doing the
glitch<00:03:50.389> you<00:03:51.169> have<00:03:51.319> to<00:03:51.440> just<00:03:51.620> farm<00:03:52.069> like<00:03:52.310> crazy

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
glitch you have to just farm like crazy

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.149 
glitch you have to just farm like crazy
but<00:03:53.930> I<00:03:54.620> hope<00:03:55.280> you<00:03:55.430> enjoyed<00:03:55.699> the<00:03:55.729> video<00:03:56.079> I<00:03:57.159> can

00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 
but I hope you enjoyed the video I can

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:59.740 
but I hope you enjoyed the video I can
maybe<00:03:58.280> try<00:03:58.519> to<00:03:58.579> find<00:03:58.909> another<00:03:59.150> way<00:03:59.269> to<00:03:59.389> level

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
maybe try to find another way to level

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.099 
maybe try to find another way to level
your<00:03:59.870> archery<00:04:00.440> but<00:04:01.150> it's<00:04:02.150> very<00:04:02.510> unlikely<00:04:02.930> that

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
your archery but it's very unlikely that

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:04.599 
your archery but it's very unlikely that
i'll<00:04:03.379> find<00:04:03.650> something<00:04:03.889> that's<00:04:04.159> better<00:04:04.400> than

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
i'll find something that's better than

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:09.520 
i'll find something that's better than
this<00:04:05.650> so<00:04:06.819> leave<00:04:07.819> a<00:04:08.269> suggestion<00:04:08.870> in<00:04:09.440> the

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
this so leave a suggestion in the
