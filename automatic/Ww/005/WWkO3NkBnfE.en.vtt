00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
the resin the quickfix resin has dried

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.419 
the resin the quickfix resin has dried
and<00:01:58.299> it<00:01:58.780> secured<00:01:59.229> the<00:01:59.409> block<00:01:59.649> in<00:01:59.859> place<00:01:59.890> so<00:02:00.310> now

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
and it secured the block in place so now

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:02.309 
and it secured the block in place so now
we're<00:02:00.579> just<00:02:00.609> going<00:02:00.819> to<00:02:00.909> trim<00:02:01.119> the<00:02:01.869> foam<00:02:02.109> off

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:02.319 
we're just going to trim the foam off

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:05.130 
we're just going to trim the foam off
we're<00:02:03.189> going<00:02:03.399> to<00:02:03.460> shape<00:02:03.640> the<00:02:03.819> foam<00:02:04.030> to<00:02:04.270> this<00:02:04.420> to

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
we're going to shape the foam to this to

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.220 
we're going to shape the foam to this to
the<00:02:05.259> rail<00:02:05.469> of<00:02:05.649> the<00:02:05.770> board<00:02:09.420> after<00:02:10.420> you<00:02:10.479> cut<00:02:10.720> out

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
the rail of the board after you cut out

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.160 
the rail of the board after you cut out
big<00:02:11.830> chunks<00:02:12.400> away<00:02:12.640> you<00:02:13.510> take<00:02:13.690> your<00:02:13.810> dragon

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
big chunks away you take your dragon

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.170 
big chunks away you take your dragon
skin<00:02:14.549> and<00:02:15.549> you<00:02:15.670> sand<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.060> phone<00:02:16.269> down<00:02:16.510> and

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
skin and you sand the phone down and

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.399 
skin and you sand the phone down and
it's<00:02:19.180> pretty<00:02:19.390> close<00:02:19.540> to<00:02:19.599> the<00:02:19.780> shape

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:23.409 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.780 

then<00:02:24.409> the<00:02:24.560> next<00:02:24.799> step<00:02:24.950> we<00:02:25.069> do<00:02:25.219> is<00:02:25.370> we<00:02:25.549> send

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
then the next step we do is we send

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.649 
then the next step we do is we send
around<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.420> gang<00:02:28.120> because<00:02:29.120> we're<00:02:29.359> gonna<00:02:29.450> put

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:29.659 
around the gang because we're gonna put

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:31.420 
around the gang because we're gonna put
a<00:02:29.719> piece<00:02:29.900> of<00:02:30.049> fiberglass<00:02:30.379> over<00:02:30.799> the<00:02:31.069> damaged

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
a piece of fiberglass over the damaged

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:39.849 
a piece of fiberglass over the damaged
Vario<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:38.959> next<00:02:39.200> step<00:02:39.349> we're<00:02:39.500> going<00:02:39.590> to<00:02:39.650> cut

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:39.859 
Vario the next step we're going to cut

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:43.270 
Vario the next step we're going to cut
the<00:02:39.950> fiberglass<00:02:40.659> to<00:02:41.659> cover<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:42.049> patch<00:02:42.260> I<00:02:42.650> cut

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
the fiberglass to cover the patch I cut

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.399 
the fiberglass to cover the patch I cut
a<00:02:43.310> piece<00:02:43.489> of<00:02:43.640> fiberglass<00:02:44.109> that's<00:02:45.109> slightly

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:45.409 
a piece of fiberglass that's slightly

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:48.309 
a piece of fiberglass that's slightly
bigger<00:02:45.769> than<00:02:45.859> the<00:02:46.069> damaged<00:02:46.459> area<00:02:47.109> so<00:02:48.109> you<00:02:48.170> can

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
bigger than the damaged area so you can

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.580 
bigger than the damaged area so you can
test<00:02:48.620> fit<00:02:48.829> it<00:02:48.950> like<00:02:48.980> that<00:02:49.250> so<00:02:49.579> it<00:02:49.609> wraps<00:02:50.590> around

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
test fit it like that so it wraps around

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.080 
test fit it like that so it wraps around
these<00:02:52.069> sides<00:02:54.159> I've<00:02:55.159> sanded<00:02:55.549> all<00:02:55.909> the<00:02:55.970> way

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
these sides I've sanded all the way

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.940 
these sides I've sanded all the way
around<00:02:56.420> a<00:02:56.629> ding<00:02:56.840> where<00:02:57.109> the<00:02:57.230> fiberglass<00:02:57.680> will

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
around a ding where the fiberglass will

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.309 
around a ding where the fiberglass will
cover<00:02:58.189> the<00:02:58.340> resin<00:02:58.700> I<00:02:58.879> mean<00:02:59.870> the<00:02:59.930> fiberglass

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
cover the resin I mean the fiberglass

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.170 
cover the resin I mean the fiberglass
will<00:03:00.530> cover<00:03:00.739> the<00:03:00.889> surfboard<00:03:01.370> so<00:03:01.879> it<00:03:02.060> will

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
will cover the surfboard so it will

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.420 
will cover the surfboard so it will
stick<00:03:02.419> well<00:03:02.629> now<00:03:03.470> I'm<00:03:03.590> going<00:03:03.799> to<00:03:03.859> put<00:03:04.099> a<00:03:04.280> little

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
stick well now I'm going to put a little

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.979 
stick well now I'm going to put a little
resident<00:03:04.879> on<00:03:04.939> top<00:03:05.150> of<00:03:05.329> the<00:03:05.389> surface<00:03:05.599> of<00:03:05.900> the

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
resident on top of the surface of the

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.539 
resident on top of the surface of the
board<00:03:06.230> where<00:03:06.470> the<00:03:06.560> resident<00:03:07.010> of<00:03:07.069> fiberglass

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
board where the resident of fiberglass

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:16.200 
board where the resident of fiberglass
cloth<00:03:07.730> is<00:03:08.030> going<00:03:08.209> to<00:03:08.269> go

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.670 

then<00:03:17.210> I'll<00:03:17.330> lay<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:17.720> cloth<00:03:17.840> on<00:03:18.260> top<00:03:18.470> of<00:03:18.620> the

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
then I'll lay the cloth on top of the

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:31.390 
then I'll lay the cloth on top of the
damaged<00:03:19.340> area

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.339 

and<00:03:31.849> I'm<00:03:31.970> going<00:03:32.150> to<00:03:32.180> saturate<00:03:32.659> the<00:03:32.780> cloth<00:03:32.930> with

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349 
and I'm going to saturate the cloth with

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:42.870 
and I'm going to saturate the cloth with
more<00:03:33.590> resin

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.990 

you<00:03:43.450> want<00:03:43.630> to<00:03:43.690> work<00:03:43.810> to<00:03:43.930> resin<00:03:44.260> into<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.590> glass

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
you want to work to resin into the glass

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:53.430 
you want to work to resin into the glass
so<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.150> glass<00:03:47.340> disappears

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.110 

at<00:03:53.950> this<00:03:54.100> point<00:03:54.310> it's<00:03:54.490> also<00:03:54.640> good<00:03:54.880> to<00:03:54.910> maybe

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
at this point it's also good to maybe

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.050 
at this point it's also good to maybe
cover<00:03:55.390> the<00:03:55.510> resin<00:03:56.020> with<00:03:56.440> your<00:03:56.620> hand<00:03:56.970> so<00:03:57.970> it

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
cover the resin with your hand so it

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:06.240 
cover the resin with your hand so it
doesn't<00:03:58.360> cure<00:03:58.600> so<00:03:59.200> quickly<00:04:04.920> and<00:04:05.920> I'm<00:04:06.040> going<00:04:06.220> to

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
doesn't cure so quickly and I'm going to

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.570 
doesn't cure so quickly and I'm going to
cover<00:04:06.430> the<00:04:06.700> fiberglass<00:04:08.370> again<00:04:09.370> with<00:04:09.550> a

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
cover the fiberglass again with a

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.130 
cover the fiberglass again with a
plastic<00:04:10.060> cloth<00:04:10.240> that<00:04:10.510> will<00:04:10.630> help<00:04:10.750> them<00:04:10.930> mold

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
plastic cloth that will help them mold

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:19.550 
plastic cloth that will help them mold
it

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.390 

and<00:04:20.130> we'll<00:04:20.310> let<00:04:20.400> it<00:04:20.459> cure<00:04:20.700> for<00:04:21.030> a<00:04:21.060> few<00:04:21.420> minutes

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
and we'll let it cure for a few minutes

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.400 
and we'll let it cure for a few minutes
oK<00:04:23.400> we've<00:04:23.610> removed<00:04:24.300> the<00:04:24.450> plastic<00:04:24.960> I<00:04:25.110> put<00:04:25.380> a

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
oK we've removed the plastic I put a

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.960 
oK we've removed the plastic I put a
second<00:04:25.800> layer<00:04:25.950> of<00:04:26.070> resin<00:04:26.460> on<00:04:26.580> top<00:04:26.760> of<00:04:26.880> the

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
second layer of resin on top of the

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.780 
second layer of resin on top of the
fiberglass<00:04:27.270> cloth<00:04:27.740> now<00:04:28.740> the<00:04:28.860> final<00:04:29.280> step<00:04:29.520> is

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
fiberglass cloth now the final step is

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.180 
fiberglass cloth now the final step is
just<00:04:29.880> to<00:04:30.180> sand<00:04:30.510> it<00:04:30.660> same<00:04:31.530> thing<00:04:31.770> again<00:04:32.040> we're

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
just to sand it same thing again we're

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.070 
just to sand it same thing again we're
going<00:04:32.280> to<00:04:32.340> start<00:04:32.550> with<00:04:32.639> a<00:04:32.669> dragon<00:04:32.940> skin<00:04:33.360> to

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
going to start with a dragon skin to

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:45.530 
going to start with a dragon skin to
take<00:04:34.230> off<00:04:34.410> any<00:04:34.650> of<00:04:34.740> the<00:04:34.950> excess<00:04:35.310> resin<00:04:44.419> and<00:04:45.419> we

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
take off any of the excess resin and we

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.030 
take off any of the excess resin and we
want<00:04:45.750> to<00:04:45.840> get<00:04:45.930> the<00:04:46.050> shape<00:04:46.290> of<00:04:46.470> the<00:04:46.590> board<00:04:46.830> back

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
want to get the shape of the board back

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.220 
want to get the shape of the board back
again<00:04:47.400> so<00:04:47.639> we're<00:04:47.790> going<00:04:47.940> to<00:04:48.000> sand<00:04:48.870> off<00:04:49.020> all<00:04:49.169> the

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
again so we're going to sand off all the

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:57.230 
again so we're going to sand off all the
excess<00:04:49.650> resin<00:04:55.460> then<00:04:56.460> we're<00:04:56.640> going<00:04:56.760> to<00:04:56.820> go<00:04:57.000> with

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
excess resin then we're going to go with

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.340 
excess resin then we're going to go with
the<00:04:57.540> 80<00:04:58.350> grit<00:04:58.620> sandpaper<00:05:00.080> to<00:05:01.080> make<00:05:01.230> it

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
the 80 grit sandpaper to make it

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:07.100 
the 80 grit sandpaper to make it
smoother<00:05:05.450> okay<00:05:06.450> then<00:05:06.630> we're<00:05:06.810> going<00:05:06.960> to<00:05:07.020> go

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
smoother okay then we're going to go

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.620 
smoother okay then we're going to go
with<00:05:07.290> the<00:05:07.410> 120<00:05:07.800> sandpaper<00:05:08.190> and<00:05:09.180> a<00:05:09.300> little

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630
