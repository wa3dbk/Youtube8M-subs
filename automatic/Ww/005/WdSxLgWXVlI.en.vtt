00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.610 
Creek and then this Creek empties out
into<00:03:43.200> a<00:03:43.440> big<00:03:43.680> river<00:03:44.040> about<00:03:44.610> I<00:03:45.050> don't<00:03:46.050> I<00:03:46.350> want<00:03:46.560> to

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
into a big river about I don't I want to

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.640 
into a big river about I don't I want to
say<00:03:46.709> about<00:03:46.800> a<00:03:46.890> mile<00:03:47.220> and<00:03:47.400> a<00:03:47.489> half<00:03:47.640> that<00:03:47.850> way<00:03:48.650> so

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
say about a mile and a half that way so

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.140 
say about a mile and a half that way so
it's<00:03:49.860> really<00:03:50.190> really<00:03:50.430> cool<00:03:50.900> lots<00:03:51.900> of<00:03:52.050> birds

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
it's really really cool lots of birds

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.850 
it's really really cool lots of birds
but<00:03:54.150> here's<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:55.020> little<00:03:55.260> small<00:03:55.530> little

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
but here's the little small little

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.920 
but here's the little small little
garden<00:03:56.360> and<00:03:57.360> the<00:03:58.350> reason<00:03:58.709> I<00:03:58.800> did<00:03:59.930> little

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
garden and the reason I did little

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.560 
garden and the reason I did little
patches<00:04:01.530> is<00:04:02.489> because<00:04:02.970> there's<00:04:03.270> some<00:04:03.450> really

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
patches is because there's some really

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.390 
patches is because there's some really
low<00:04:03.810> spots<00:04:04.140> in<00:04:04.350> the<00:04:04.470> in<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.709> yard<00:04:04.890> that<00:04:05.040> almost

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
low spots in the in the yard that almost

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.010 
low spots in the in the yard that almost
hold<00:04:05.850> water<00:04:06.120> and<00:04:06.300> they're<00:04:06.390> not<00:04:06.450> necessarily

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
hold water and they're not necessarily

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.220 
hold water and they're not necessarily
the<00:04:07.140> best<00:04:07.260> for<00:04:07.560> growing<00:04:07.770> most<00:04:08.700> crops<00:04:09.209> so<00:04:10.200> I

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
the best for growing most crops so I

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.509 
the best for growing most crops so I
just<00:04:10.530> kind<00:04:10.709> of<00:04:10.739> like<00:04:10.890> there's<00:04:11.100> a<00:04:11.160> little<00:04:11.340> hill

made just the other day these are three
big<00:04:57.750> tables<00:04:58.260> that<00:04:58.500> the<00:04:59.100> previous<00:04:59.550> owners<00:04:59.910> had

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
big tables that the previous owners had

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.480 
big tables that the previous owners had
here<00:05:01.200> and<00:05:01.380> the<00:05:01.560> guy<00:05:01.680> asked<00:05:01.950> me<00:05:01.980> if<00:05:02.100> I<00:05:02.160> wanted

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
here and the guy asked me if I wanted

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.980 
here and the guy asked me if I wanted
over<00:05:02.700> if<00:05:02.820> not<00:05:03.000> we<00:05:03.150> could<00:05:03.270> break<00:05:03.510> him<00:05:03.660> down<00:05:03.810> and

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
over if not we could break him down and

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.020 
over if not we could break him down and
Byrne<00:05:04.110> was<00:05:04.260> like<00:05:04.380> no<00:05:04.530> I'll<00:05:04.710> take<00:05:04.890> them<00:05:05.040> so<00:05:06.000> I

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
Byrne was like no I'll take them so I

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.930 
Byrne was like no I'll take them so I
just<00:05:06.270> took<00:05:06.450> these<00:05:06.660> three<00:05:06.870> tables<00:05:07.850> put<00:05:08.850> them

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
just took these three tables put them

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.450 
just took these three tables put them
together<00:05:09.090> and<00:05:09.720> I<00:05:10.530> found<00:05:10.860> out<00:05:11.070> the<00:05:11.160> reason<00:05:11.280> I

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
together and I found out the reason I

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.880 
together and I found out the reason I
did<00:05:11.640> that<00:05:11.670> was<00:05:11.910> because<00:05:11.940> I<00:05:12.240> found<00:05:12.420> this<00:05:12.600> wire

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:12.890 
did that was because I found this wire

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:15.800 
did that was because I found this wire
this<00:05:13.890> little<00:05:14.250> fence<00:05:14.490> right<00:05:14.700> here<00:05:15.000> which

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
this little fence right here which

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.020 
this little fence right here which
almost<00:05:16.050> fitted<00:05:16.410> it<00:05:16.530> perfect<00:05:17.100> right<00:05:17.850> over

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
almost fitted it perfect right over

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.640 
almost fitted it perfect right over
there<00:05:18.150> in<00:05:18.210> the<00:05:18.300> woods<00:05:18.450> they<00:05:19.169> kind<00:05:19.410> of<00:05:19.440> they

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
there in the woods they kind of they

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:20.900 
there in the woods they kind of they
must<00:05:19.800> have<00:05:19.919> just<00:05:20.070> threw<00:05:20.280> it<00:05:20.400> over<00:05:20.610> there

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
must have just threw it over there

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.270 
must have just threw it over there
so<00:05:21.690> I<00:05:21.750> was<00:05:21.870> like<00:05:21.960> crap<00:05:22.620> I<00:05:22.860> mean<00:05:23.040> that's<00:05:23.190> a

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
so I was like crap I mean that's a

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.650 
so I was like crap I mean that's a
little<00:05:23.400> that's<00:05:23.669> a<00:05:23.970> quick<00:05:24.120> little<00:05:24.390> chicken
