 at 

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.050
 at 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.130

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:17.990

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.150
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.160
 new information video on gta 5 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.160
 online where we will talk about a new 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.410
 leak so that appeared yesterday leak that has 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.510
 been found by nils fashion and his team 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.010
 about the apartment publisher 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.960
 so remember we already had some 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.820
 spoke several times a publisher 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.129
 of apartments that would allow us so 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.860
 to modify and custom as it is 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.690
 wants our appart is so there according to them 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.640
 I'll read it later it 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.190
 would have managed to have this editor 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.780
 of apartments in the menus so do not me 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.180
 ask not how yet they say 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.040
 did it to support that he we 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.809
 gives two screen of this editor in 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.850
 the menus and adds them as he does not 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.050
 can not give more evidence when 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.730
 otherwise like last time so he 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.160
 had given a lot of information 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.870
 on the christmas dlc and he had had 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.600
 some small problems with take to do 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.800
 for those who know and so there 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.690
 it's all gone if I'm going to tell you what 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.979
 that they have posted us so after 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.810
 long research we have been in 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.149
 able to discover the long-awaited 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.439
 apartment designer this option 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:17.479
 will allow players with a 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:19.790
 top gan apartment of the 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.380
 customize as you wish so that each 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.450
 player is a unique apartment and 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.909
 different you will be able to 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.619
 turn fixed move the furniture from 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.310
 your apartment or even change the 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.979
 brightness 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.320
 the limits are set to 100 objects on 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.390
 the next gen consoles and 50 objects for 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.939
 the consoles to the jane the brightness 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.280
 minimum is limited to 20% for 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.180
 next gen consoles and 10% for 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.770
 old gen consoles 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.210
 so that's a reminder I already had it 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.439
 announced I believe it was there 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.130
 twelve days in the same a video 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.079
 of information 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.850
 right now we do not have 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.680
 still have access to all the options of this 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.530
 mode because other options can be 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.579
 added modified or deleted during 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.710
 the official launch 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:00.200
 there is also an option 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.759
 accessibility that would allow 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.890
 certain activities like for example the 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.619
 television to be turned on or off 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.959
 for the invited players so for the 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.549
 visitors we pushed our limits 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.250
 by offering you these two catches 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:14.870
 in watermark to confirm so 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.459
 what what we what you are told 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.350
 because it's a gaming tool that does not have 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.940
 still been officially announced and 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.620
 we have already been convicted for the 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.200
 same kind of offense so as game 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.120
 10 for the christmas dlc files 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.739
 originals of the appart management have been 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.170
 removed from the developer server 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.120
 but have been archived by our team 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.230
 and that's how you saw it 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.280
 we still learn a lot of 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.379
 news about this publisher 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.849
 of apartments so of them they have 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.379
 even managed to have it in the menus 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.930
 so look at you I put your feet 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:43.099
 screen on screen so as they the 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.780
 say they can not put more than 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.610
 proofs otherwise they will have worries 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.280
 by take two so what manages a little 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.720
 it's a bit of a shame they say 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.790
 that they will put two pieces of information 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.079
 following he also evokes so the means 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.910
 to share our creations 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.980
 so why not for example if ever 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.840
 your friends create a beautiful interior 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.370
 of apartments and you want them themselves 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.230
 you can surely download it 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.060
 like a race a clash on the 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.040
 social club to be able to put it in 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.269
 your apartment 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.140
 and so we come to the end of 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.159
 this video anyway I hope 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.959
 you really liked it 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.430
 do not hesitate to drop a little thumb 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.989
 purpose if that's the case and to subscribe if 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.280
 it's not already done do not hesitate to 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.349
 tell us what you think all this in 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.700
 comment so this information that 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.260
 are not yet official I the 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.569
 remember it's news that was 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.910
 found by neither exposed nor his team in 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.530
 the game files and so that's me I 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.000
 will you leave on these images I will 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.090
