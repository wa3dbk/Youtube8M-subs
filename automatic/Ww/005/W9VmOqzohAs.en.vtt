to make sure that we do the right steps
and<00:03:10.690> the<00:03:11.690> right<00:03:11.840> things<00:03:12.110> to<00:03:12.200> make<00:03:12.290> sure<00:03:12.410> that

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
and the right things to make sure that

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.170 
and the right things to make sure that
we're<00:03:12.830> doing<00:03:12.920> it<00:03:13.160> as<00:03:13.340> safe<00:03:14.090> as<00:03:14.270> possible

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
we're doing it as safe as possible

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.520 
we're doing it as safe as possible
everything<00:03:17.180> we<00:03:17.390> do<00:03:17.570> is<00:03:17.750> is<00:03:18.530> risky<00:03:19.450> obviously

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
everything we do is is risky obviously

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.810 
everything we do is is risky obviously
that's<00:03:21.530> also<00:03:21.860> a<00:03:21.890> reason<00:03:22.130> why<00:03:22.340> we<00:03:22.459> love<00:03:22.580> to<00:03:22.730> do

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
that's also a reason why we love to do

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.120 
that's also a reason why we love to do
it<00:03:22.970> because<00:03:23.390> there<00:03:23.780> are<00:03:24.020> risks<00:03:24.650> that<00:03:24.740> we<00:03:24.890> take

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
it because there are risks that we take

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.420 
it because there are risks that we take
that<00:03:25.160> give<00:03:25.610> us<00:03:26.650> whatever<00:03:27.650> that<00:03:27.860> feeling<00:03:28.280> is

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
that give us whatever that feeling is

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.340 
that give us whatever that feeling is
that<00:03:29.240> makes<00:03:29.420> us<00:03:29.540> want<00:03:29.690> to<00:03:29.750> keep<00:03:29.840> doing<00:03:30.050> it

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
that makes us want to keep doing it

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.280 
that makes us want to keep doing it
