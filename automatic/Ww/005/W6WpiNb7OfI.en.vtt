00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
a couple of times you know we didn't

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.490 
a couple of times you know we didn't
finished<00:02:21.360> some<00:02:21.480> plays<00:02:21.660> both<00:02:21.870> offensively<00:02:22.410> and

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
finished some plays both offensively and

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.280 
finished some plays both offensively and
defensively<00:02:23.569> and<00:02:24.569> we<00:02:24.720> didn't<00:02:24.900> have<00:02:24.989> to<00:02:25.019> plump

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
defensively and we didn't have to plump

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.479 
defensively and we didn't have to plump
which<00:02:25.379> was<00:02:25.530> good<00:02:25.680> since<00:02:25.830> you<00:02:25.950> only<00:02:26.069> put<00:02:26.280> it<00:02:26.370> in

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
which was good since you only put it in

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.640 
which was good since you only put it in
yesterday<00:02:26.670> for<00:02:27.060> 45<00:02:27.390> minutes<00:02:27.599> so<00:02:27.870> there's

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
yesterday for 45 minutes so there's

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.170 
yesterday for 45 minutes so there's
definitely<00:02:28.800> things<00:02:29.400> for<00:02:29.580> us<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.790> improve<00:02:29.910> on

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
definitely things for us to improve on

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.729 
definitely things for us to improve on
but<00:02:30.209> for<00:02:30.569> it<00:02:30.660> being<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.959> first<00:02:31.140> game<00:02:31.349> you<00:02:31.650> know

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
but for it being the first game you know

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:32.990 
but for it being the first game you know
we're<00:02:31.860> not<00:02:31.950> chance<00:02:32.220> or<00:02:32.370> anything<00:02:32.670> yet<00:02:32.790> it<00:02:32.910> was

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
we're not chance or anything yet it was

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.009 
we're not chance or anything yet it was
definitely<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.390> good<00:02:33.510> way<00:02:33.629> to<00:02:33.690> kick<00:02:33.870> off<00:02:33.959> the

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
definitely a good way to kick off the

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
I think they did really well as the game

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:47.969

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:50.340 
us we came out in played a really good

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.500 
us we came out in played a really good
team<00:06:50.610> you<00:06:50.639> know<00:06:50.849> if<00:06:50.940> we<00:06:51.030> were<00:06:51.120> to<00:06:51.180> come<00:06:51.300> out<00:06:51.419> and

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:51.510 
team you know if we were to come out and

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:52.670 
team you know if we were to come out and
play<00:06:51.630> the<00:06:51.690> team<00:06:51.870> that<00:06:51.960> wasn't<00:06:52.229> very<00:06:52.260> good<00:06:52.410> and

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:52.680 
play the team that wasn't very good and

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.860 
play the team that wasn't very good and
and<00:06:53.160> and<00:06:53.580> had<00:06:53.820> a<00:06:53.849> lot<00:06:54.030> of<00:06:54.060> success<00:06:54.419> maybe<00:06:54.690> we

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:54.870 
and and had a lot of success maybe we

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.779 
and and had a lot of success maybe we
would<00:06:55.050> have<00:06:55.080> you<00:06:55.440> know<00:06:55.500> we<00:06:55.830> it<00:06:56.310> wouldn't<00:06:56.580> drive

00:06:56.779 --> 00:06:56.789 
would have you know we it wouldn't drive

00:06:56.789 --> 00:06:57.920 
would have you know we it wouldn't drive
us<00:06:56.970> so<00:06:57.090> I<00:06:57.120> think<00:06:57.210> they're<00:06:57.479> going<00:06:57.599> to<00:06:57.660> be<00:06:57.720> driven

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:57.930 
us so I think they're going to be driven

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.420 
us so I think they're going to be driven
in<00:06:58.110> practice<00:06:58.500> to<00:06:58.740> step<00:06:58.949> it<00:06:59.070> up<00:06:59.130> a<00:06:59.220> little<00:06:59.340> bit

00:06:59.420 --> 00:06:59.430 
in practice to step it up a little bit

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.250 
in practice to step it up a little bit
they<00:06:59.639> know<00:06:59.789> what<00:06:59.940> to<00:07:00.060> expect<00:07:00.090> and<00:07:00.930> we've<00:07:01.139> got

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:02.419
