00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
grain of the meat it makes it a little

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.730 
grain of the meat it makes it a little
bit<00:01:12.420> more<00:01:12.600> tender<00:01:14.030> and<00:01:15.229> then<00:01:16.229> this<00:01:16.440> is<00:01:16.619> going

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740
