00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.680
Hi. Itâ€™s Mr. Andersen and this is AP Physics
essentials video 124. It is on electromagnetic

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.699
waves, which are the oscillations that create
electromagnetic radiation. And they are important.

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:21.380
And so light is electromagnetic radiation
and therefore it is carried in these electromagnetic

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.839
waves. And does light make it from the sun
to the earth? Of course. And so that means

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:32.579
that electromagnetic waves can make it through
the vacuum of space. But can you hear the

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:39.379
sun? No. And that means that the mechanical
sound waves are not able to transfer through

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.820
space. If they could scientists have estimated
that the sound of the sun would be around

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.789
100 decibels. So that is about the sound of
a jackhammer a few meters away. So it would

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.839
be deafening in sound. So it is a good thing
that we do not hear the sun. But it is really

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:58.749
important that we see it. That those electromagnetic
waves make it here. It keeps us warm. It also

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:03.679
allows plants to grow and so we can survive.
And so the electromagnetic spectrum is made

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:09.680
up of these electromagnetic waves. And they
go from high energy, really high frequency

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:16.340
low wave length gamma rays all the way down
to long wavelength low energy radio waves.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.270
Remember you are only seeing a small portion
of that. But the one thing these all have

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.220
in common is that they are made up of electromagnetic
waves. Those are transverse waves. Remember

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.110
what a transverse wave is, is one where the
oscillations are perpendicular or at ninety

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.820
degrees to the direction of the movement of
the wave. And so it is not only in one dimension,

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.790
we also have electric fields and magnetic
fields that are perpendicular to themselves.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.590
And so we have oscillations that are both
perpendicular to the direction of motion and

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.070
the corresponding field. And so they can travel
through anything. Electromagnetic waves can

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.180
travel through medium like light can move
through water obviously. Or radio waves can

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.700
move through the walls of my house so I can
hear the radio. But they can also move through

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.650
the vacuum of space. And so if we look at
electromagnetic waves, remember as we move

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.060
towards high energy gamma rays our wavelength
is decreasing but our frequency is increasing.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.050
So radio waves have really long wavelengths
around the size of a building where as gamma

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.960
rays would be more the size of an atom itself.
But if we look at how they oscillate, remember

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.050
the wave is going to move in this direction
and the oscillation is going to be perpendicular

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.350
to that. But adding on top of that we also
have these fields. And so the direction of

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.930
the wave is going to be, we will say, from
left to right in this dimension. But we are

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.380
also going to have, in the Z dimension, we
are going to have these electric fields that

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.000
oscillate back and forth. And then in the
Y or rather in the X we are going to have

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.150
magnetic fields that go back and forth. And
so to give you a visual of what they really

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.460
look like, we have these oscillations in these
two dimensions and then the movement is going

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.880
to be in the third dimension. And that starts
to explain why we have things like the right-hand

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.860
rule when it comes to electricity. And so
energy can move from point A to point B in

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.400
two ways. It could move as a particle. We
could shot a particle from A to B. But the

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.740
other way we can transfer energy is through
a wave. We could oscillate, for example the

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.709
water here, we could oscillate it back and
forth. That would create waves that could

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:24.340
move B back and forth. Now that would be a
mechanical wave because we physically have

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.270
to have a medium to transfer the energy from
one to another. But electromagnetic waves

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.250
are not mechanical. That means they could
move through the water, they could move through

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.330
the medium but they could also move through
the vacuum of space. And so did you learn

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.450
to describe the model of an electromagnetic
wave? It is both a transverse perpendicular

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:50.290
to electric field and magnetic field. And
also it can move through the vacuum of space.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:04:02.920
And 
I hope that was helpful.
