00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.769
 Confederations in June 2003 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:41.980
 several opening times were

 stipulated and postponed during the construction 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.360
 among the thousands of workers who 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:51.010

 under study 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.040
 in October the arson consume 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.500
 polystyrene structures stored in the 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.470
 subsoil of the stadium but did not commit 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.680
 the structures of the arena to the 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.770
 construction of the 109 thousand meter stadium 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.370
 square footage was completed on 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.800
 February so much that the pantanal sand 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:23.140
 hosted two matches of the Copa do Brasil and 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:27.880

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.750
 leave vehicles away from the stadium 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:39.550
 because the parking lot of two thousand and 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:42.909
 400 cars in the surrounding area and 460 in the 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:45.100

 for the cup for the fifa world cup 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.730
 does not require that the stadium has a 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.370
 parking lot next to the building in 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.659
 In our case we have 2,400 places 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.930
 covered to comply with the legislation 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.670
 this has come since the license is 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.830
 that the construction of the work 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.750
 it's like we have the possibility to 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.630
 fifa then used from 2004 can be 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.909
 places to put the fifa family 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.560

 fifa family fifa fifa team people 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.370

 340 thousand meters outside area 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.150
 square part of it is occupied by 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.630

 within the facility that involves 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.540
 arena or all this will have to have

 the accreditation people will have to 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.340
 be accredited to entering the 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.980
 from asset security is also 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.959
 given by the local organizing committee that 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.660
 is installed here and we get the 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.769
 operation of the stadium apart is 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:44.750
 building automation to lighting part 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:47.209
 all these parts that we need is 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.670
 of people who already understand the business 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.380
 so we have this operation and it will 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.209
 continue in our hands with a team of 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:59.470
 1624 seats for fans 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:02.030
 are in 97 cabins of the pantanal sand 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:05.959
 some of them have not yet received the 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:09.739
 special cushioned armchairs already 41 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:13.250
 thousand and 390 seats are on levels one 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:17.030
 near the lawn and four at the top of 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:20.510
 stadium but the maximum capacity for 44 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.880
 thousand fans only after the cup because 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.370
 on the highest floor of the arena in the 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.669
 west among the supporters' chairs 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:31.370
 benches are being built for the 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:35.539
 work of narrators of the four games 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.980
 of the total cup is 1624 places for 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:40.520
 press professionals 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:43.790
 and 36 locations for installation of cameras 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.520
 broadcasting of matches on the 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:51.200
 internal video security circuit 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:53.330
 of the 320 and planned cameras 280 have already been 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.360
 installed the four operators of 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.150
 phones are also installing new 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.670
 equipment within the Pantanal sand 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:04.250
 to ensure the expected communication of 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:06.770
 supporters through devices 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.490
 furniture within the stadium during the 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.930
 departures 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.730
 during the cup we have a 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.860
 setting up a press gallery 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:16.070
 which lies inside the upper bleachers 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.290
 in the western sector, this tribune occupies the 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.810
 place of more or less 3 thousand seats 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:23.210
 which would be in connected form then we 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:26.600
 we have two formats one is the cup format 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:29.390
 of the world we have 41,300 90 seats 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:32.060
 approximately they will be is apt 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:33.740
 to be sold to the games already 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.900
 are being sold for the games 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.480
 and the other is the delegate format is like the 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:41.690
 stadium sits after the canopy though and he 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.940
 then assume the configuration of 44 thousand 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.740
 which is the total capacity of the 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.670
 Pantanal sand is so it will stay 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.920
 to receive the championship games 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.930
 state and whatever 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.380
 competition was to receive after the 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.890
 world 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:57.620
 the pantanal arena has 948 bathrooms 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:59.690
 including in locker rooms where they will be 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.120
 the selections from eight countries 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.940
 here there are modern faucets that are 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.250
 open only through sensors in the 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:10.010
 access corridor to the cabins of the 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:12.410
 level 3 part of the ceiling had to be 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:15.410
 changed due to leakage of 

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:17.930
 sewer in the place a strong odor that 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.950
 needs to be corrected by the builder 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.930
 from the stadium 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:23.150
 we have a percentage in which people 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:26.420
 it can already be said that it is delivered and 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:29.030
 this is around 95% ahead of 

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:31.040
 these 5% are exactly the adjustment 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.620
 fine that effect where you place it 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.390
 events tests to do some some 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.400
 operations where you identify 

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:39.620
 some situations still 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.510
 do what we need to know some 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.970
 matter of hydraulics any question of 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:46.280
 clogging any issue is somehow 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.600
 faucet that does not come out is an elevator that 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.009
 suddenly not working the way 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.550
 right somewhere that the lighting does not 

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:54.689
 is still completely is 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.520
 automated, then are these situations 

00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:57.930
 that if you do not put the building 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.330
 operation you can not identify 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:03.509
 after four years of construction despite 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:05.449
 problems of delays and costs 

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:08.999
 the engineer responsible for the work 

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:12.119
 compare the brand new pantanal arena with 

00:07:08.999 --> 00:07:14.869
 the old stadium is true when considering the 

00:07:12.119 --> 00:07:17.939
 legacy to be enjoyed by the 

00:07:14.869 --> 00:07:19.649
 Cuiabana and Mato Grosso have no other 

00:07:17.939 --> 00:07:21.659
 feeling that because I may have 

00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:24.839
 which is not very proud because I am 

00:07:21.659 --> 00:07:26.759
 cuiabana of family is always liked 

00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:28.949
 football has been following this 

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:30.899
 child when I was 7 8 years old 

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:33.719
 he frequented the old verbiage of seeing 

00:07:30.899 --> 00:07:36.059
 big games out there with a steak fly is hand 

00:07:33.719 --> 00:07:38.279
 with so many players that I had the 

00:07:36.059 --> 00:07:40.830
 pleasure to go on the field together 

00:07:38.279 --> 00:07:43.259
 Because at the time my father was and he was 

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:45.149
 part of the panel of judges of the 

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:47.610
 matogrossense football federation and 

00:07:45.149 --> 00:07:49.709
 now has the opportunity to be the 

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:52.819
 engineer responsible for all this is 

00:07:49.709 --> 00:07:52.819
 really very proud
