00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
out like this thin from one side and

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.200 
out like this thin from one side and
thick<00:00:07.770> from<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.189> other<00:00:08.309> side<00:00:08.610> and<00:00:08.880> kind<00:00:09.059> of

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
thick from the other side and kind of

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.390 
thick from the other side and kind of
like<00:00:09.380> sagging<00:00:10.380> in<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.620> middle<00:00:10.889> it<00:00:11.130> used<00:00:11.309> to

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
like sagging in the middle it used to

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.100 
like sagging in the middle it used to
happen<00:00:11.550> with<00:00:11.790> me<00:00:11.880> pretty<00:00:12.150> often<00:00:12.540> all<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:12.870> time

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
happen with me pretty often all the time

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
I'm going to share my tips with you on

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.890 
I'm going to share my tips with you on
getting<00:00:26.699> them<00:00:26.910> they're<00:00:27.449> actually<00:00:27.779> quite

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
getting them they're actually quite

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.870 
getting them they're actually quite
simple<00:00:28.170> there<00:00:28.680> are<00:00:28.800> three<00:00:29.099> tips<00:00:29.369> on<00:00:29.519> getting

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
simple there are three tips on getting

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.810 
simple there are three tips on getting
flat<00:00:30.449> layers<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.260> cakes<00:00:31.529> tip<00:00:32.009> number<00:00:32.189> one<00:00:32.520> it's

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
flat layers of cakes tip number one it's

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.090 
flat layers of cakes tip number one it's
pretty<00:00:33.390> basic<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:34.020> pretty<00:00:34.320> obvious<00:00:34.739> but<00:00:34.980> it

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
pretty basic and pretty obvious but it

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.280 
pretty basic and pretty obvious but it
actually<00:00:35.610> may<00:00:36.329> be<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.540> most<00:00:36.719> important<00:00:37.140> one

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
actually may be the most important one

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.000 
actually may be the most important one
make<00:00:38.160> sure<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.700> your<00:00:38.940> oven<00:00:39.300> rack<00:00:39.540> is

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
make sure that your oven rack is

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.680 
make sure that your oven rack is
straight<00:00:41.010> now<00:00:41.610> this<00:00:41.820> might<00:00:42.000> sound<00:00:42.239> silly

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
straight now this might sound silly

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.020 
straight now this might sound silly
but<00:00:43.140> if<00:00:43.320> there's<00:00:43.559> an<00:00:43.680> inclination<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.430> like<00:00:44.670> 1

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
but if there's an inclination of like 1

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.000 
but if there's an inclination of like 1
degree<00:00:45.239> this<00:00:45.629> might<00:00:45.870> make<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.110> huge<00:00:46.530> difference

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
degree this might make a huge difference

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.190 
degree this might make a huge difference
in<00:00:47.160> your<00:00:47.190> cake<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.360> basically<00:00:48.809> your<00:00:48.960> pan

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
in your cake and so basically your pan

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.590 
in your cake and so basically your pan
would<00:00:49.440> be<00:00:49.559> like<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:50.070> instead<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.059> like<00:00:51.180> this

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
would be like this instead of like this

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.740 
would be like this instead of like this
and<00:00:51.960> if<00:00:52.829> your<00:00:53.010> batter<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.520> runny<00:00:53.850> batter<00:00:54.390> will

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
and if your batter is runny batter will

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.810 
and if your batter is runny batter will
go<00:00:54.899> on<00:00:55.050> one<00:00:55.230> side<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.739> your<00:00:56.070> cake<00:00:56.309> will<00:00:56.489> end<00:00:56.670> up

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
go on one side and your cake will end up

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.750 
go on one side and your cake will end up
looking<00:00:57.000> looking<00:00:57.629> like<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.730> make<00:00:59.730> sure

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
looking looking like this so make sure

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.299 
looking looking like this so make sure
that<00:01:00.239> your<00:01:00.510> oven<00:01:00.690> rack<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.410> straight<00:01:01.739> now<00:01:02.010> over

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
that your oven rack is straight now over

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.609 
that your oven rack is straight now over
time<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.789> will<00:01:02.910> place<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> lot<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.660> heavy<00:01:03.899> stuff

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
time you will place a lot of heavy stuff

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.830 
time you will place a lot of heavy stuff
like<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:05.010> heavy<00:01:05.460> lasagna<00:01:05.970> casserole<00:01:06.479> or<00:01:06.780> a

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
like a heavy lasagna casserole or a

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.039 
like a heavy lasagna casserole or a
turkey<00:01:07.560> what<00:01:08.159> will<00:01:08.340> happen<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.049> the

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
turkey what will happen is that the

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.950 
turkey what will happen is that the
weight<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.590> these<00:01:11.070> dishes<00:01:11.310> might<00:01:11.820> bend<00:01:12.510> the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
weight of these dishes might bend the

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.920 
weight of these dishes might bend the
the<00:01:13.470> rack<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.549> basically<00:01:15.000> your<00:01:15.479> rack<00:01:15.659> will

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
the rack and so basically your rack will

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.870 
the rack and so basically your rack will
not<00:01:16.110> be<00:01:16.259> straight<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:17.460> might<00:01:17.610> not<00:01:17.729> be

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
not be straight and you might not be

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.149 
not be straight and you might not be
able<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.119> see<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.570> but<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.740> could<00:01:19.979> be<00:01:20.009> a

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
able to see it but that could be a

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.120 
able to see it but that could be a
reason<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:21.150> as<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.600> can<00:01:21.750> see<00:01:21.810> what<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:22.560> do<00:01:22.710> is

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
reason so as you can see what I do is

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.100 
reason so as you can see what I do is
that<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.880> see<00:01:24.030> this<00:01:24.180> stainless<00:01:24.479> steel<00:01:24.840> bowl

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
that you see this stainless steel bowl

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.710 
that you see this stainless steel bowl
its<00:01:25.799> height<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.340> actually<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.880> same<00:01:27.090> height

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
its height is actually the same height

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.350 
its height is actually the same height
as<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.020> distance<00:01:28.439> between<00:01:28.759> the<00:01:29.759> rack<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.000> the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
as the distance between the rack and the

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.660 
as the distance between the rack and the
bottom<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.290> oven<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.040> keep<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.549> in

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
bottom of the oven and so I keep it in

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.010 
bottom of the oven and so I keep it in
the<00:01:32.759> oven<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.420> way<00:01:33.630> when<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:33.900> put

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
the oven and that way when I put

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.460 
the oven and that way when I put
something<00:01:34.229> heavy<00:01:34.770> on<00:01:35.270> on<00:01:36.270> my<00:01:36.479> rack<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.259> weight

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
something heavy on on my rack the weight

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.490 
something heavy on on my rack the weight
is<00:01:37.770> supported<00:01:38.040> by<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:39.420> bowl<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.930> that's<00:01:40.170> by

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
is supported by the bowl and that's by

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.929 
is supported by the bowl and that's by
the<00:01:40.560> rack<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.100> therefore<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.549> rack<00:01:41.729> will

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
the rack and therefore the rack will

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.749 
the rack and therefore the rack will
never<00:01:42.150> bend<00:01:42.420> downward<00:01:42.689> but<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:44.159> don't<00:01:44.549> know<00:01:44.610> if

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
never bend downward but I don't know if

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:45.920 
never bend downward but I don't know if
I'm<00:01:44.850> going<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.060> recommend<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.540> do<00:01:45.750> that

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
I'm going to recommend you to do that

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.499 
I'm going to recommend you to do that
because<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.320> doesn't<00:01:46.770> look<00:01:46.860> very<00:01:46.890> pretty<00:01:47.509> but

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
because it doesn't look very pretty but

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.940 
because it doesn't look very pretty but
what<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.780> can<00:01:48.930> do<00:01:49.079> once<00:01:49.320> in<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.590> while<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:49.920> that

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
what you can do once in a while is that

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.190 
what you can do once in a while is that
you<00:01:50.280> can<00:01:50.460> take<00:01:50.700> off<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:50.939> rack<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.990> can

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
you can take off the rack and you can

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.830 
you can take off the rack and you can
turn<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.590> on<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.829> other<00:01:52.950> side<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.490> way

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
turn it on the other side and that way

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.530 
turn it on the other side and that way
if<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:55.049> bends<00:01:55.439> downwards<00:01:55.979> by<00:01:56.610> turning<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.180> the

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
if it bends downwards by turning it the

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.539 
if it bends downwards by turning it the
weight<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.960> your<00:01:58.229> dishes<00:01:58.439> will<00:01:58.890> bend<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.369> back

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
weight of your dishes will bend it back

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.990 
weight of your dishes will bend it back
in<00:01:59.759> place<00:02:00.079> tip<00:02:01.079> number<00:02:01.259> two<00:02:01.590> make<00:02:02.460> sure<00:02:02.790> your

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
in place tip number two make sure your

says 180 degree

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.000 
says 180 degree
is<00:02:08.869> your<00:02:09.590> oven<00:02:09.920> has<00:02:10.160> to<00:02:10.220> be<00:02:10.720> hot<00:02:11.720> at<00:02:12.020> 180

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
is your oven has to be hot at 180

happens usually is that it might get hot

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.470 
happens usually is that it might get hot
depending<00:02:43.280> on<00:02:43.370> your<00:02:43.459> oven<00:02:43.520> in<00:02:43.850> Gunma<00:02:44.120> it<00:02:44.270> might

thermometer which you would place in the
center<00:03:18.410> of<00:03:18.440> the<00:03:18.650> oven<00:03:18.769> because<00:03:19.580> this<00:03:19.910> is<00:03:20.030> where

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
center of the oven because this is where

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.150 
center of the oven because this is where
we're<00:03:20.720> normally<00:03:21.140> would<00:03:21.320> place<00:03:21.530> this<00:03:21.680> cake<00:03:21.920> and

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
we're normally would place this cake and

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.550 
we're normally would place this cake and
and<00:03:22.400> when<00:03:22.730> this<00:03:22.970> thermometer<00:03:23.780> displays<00:03:24.380> the

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
and when this thermometer displays the

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.560 
and when this thermometer displays the
desired<00:03:24.890> temperature<00:03:25.280> this<00:03:26.000> is<00:03:26.239> when<00:03:26.390> you

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
desired temperature this is when you

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.750 
desired temperature this is when you
would<00:03:26.720> pop<00:03:27.260> your<00:03:27.470> cake<00:03:27.680> or<00:03:27.920> your<00:03:28.040> pan<00:03:28.250> into<00:03:28.580> the

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
would pop your cake or your pan into the

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.600 
would pop your cake or your pan into the
oven<00:03:28.880> I<00:03:29.500> got<00:03:30.500> this<00:03:30.650> from<00:03:30.890> a<00:03:31.040> home<00:03:31.190> supply<00:03:31.549> store

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
oven I got this from a home supply store

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.340 
oven I got this from a home supply store
it<00:03:31.940> was<00:03:32.090> I<00:03:32.269> think<00:03:32.540> less<00:03:32.750> than<00:03:32.780> three<00:03:33.140> dollars

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
it was I think less than three dollars

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.140 
it was I think less than three dollars
so<00:03:33.500> it's<00:03:33.799> very<00:03:33.950> affordable<00:03:34.519> but<00:03:34.790> it<00:03:34.850> will

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
so it's very affordable but it will

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.060 
so it's very affordable but it will
definitely<00:03:35.480> improve<00:03:36.230> your<00:03:36.709> baking

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
definitely improve your baking

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.090 
definitely improve your baking

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
experience tip number three now tip

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.770 
experience tip number three now tip
number<00:03:40.130> three<00:03:40.579> is<00:03:40.610> actually<00:03:41.150> not<00:03:41.329> just<00:03:41.540> for

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
number three is actually not just for

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.930 
number three is actually not just for
getting<00:03:41.900> flat<00:03:42.260> cakes<00:03:42.560> but<00:03:42.769> for<00:03:43.400> baking<00:03:43.790> as<00:03:43.910> a

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
getting flat cakes but for baking as a

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.720 
getting flat cakes but for baking as a
general<00:03:44.390> baking<00:03:44.780> rule<00:03:44.989> you<00:03:45.799> must<00:03:46.040> not<00:03:46.400> open

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
general baking rule you must not open

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.920 
general baking rule you must not open
your<00:03:47.239> oven<00:03:47.660> door<00:03:47.959> as<00:03:48.290> your<00:03:49.100> cake<00:03:49.340> is<00:03:49.610> rising<00:03:50.209> so

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
your oven door as your cake is rising so

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.660 
your oven door as your cake is rising so
what<00:03:51.170> happens<00:03:51.590> is<00:03:51.739> that<00:03:51.890> when<00:03:52.070> you<00:03:52.190> pop<00:03:52.430> your

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
what happens is that when you pop your

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.259 
what happens is that when you pop your
pan<00:03:53.000> into<00:03:53.209> the<00:03:53.360> oven<00:03:54.280> your<00:03:55.280> cake<00:03:55.579> for<00:03:56.030> it<00:03:56.120> to

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
pan into the oven your cake for it to

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.080 
pan into the oven your cake for it to
bake<00:03:56.450> it<00:03:56.720> has<00:03:56.989> to<00:03:57.260> it<00:03:57.560> means<00:03:57.980> it<00:03:58.220> needs<00:03:58.489> hot<00:03:58.820> air

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
bake it has to it means it needs hot air

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.479 
bake it has to it means it needs hot air
in<00:03:59.450> order<00:04:00.049> to<00:04:00.200> rise<00:04:00.380> and<00:04:00.680> bake<00:04:00.950> and<00:04:01.190> become<00:04:01.459> a

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
in order to rise and bake and become a

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.819 
in order to rise and bake and become a
cake<00:04:01.760> so<00:04:02.180> what<00:04:02.420> happens<00:04:02.840> is<00:04:03.019> that<00:04:03.049> as<00:04:03.470> it's

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
cake so what happens is that as it's

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:06.400 
cake so what happens is that as it's
baking<00:04:04.310> as<00:04:04.579> it's<00:04:04.850> rising<00:04:05.090> if<00:04:05.540> you<00:04:05.780> open<00:04:06.290> the

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
baking as it's rising if you open the

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.170 
baking as it's rising if you open the
oven<00:04:06.440> door<00:04:06.680> you're<00:04:07.459> going<00:04:07.670> to<00:04:07.820> bring<00:04:08.030> in<00:04:08.150> some

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
oven door you're going to bring in some

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.900 
oven door you're going to bring in some
cold<00:04:08.660> air<00:04:08.900> into<00:04:09.440> the<00:04:09.530> oven<00:04:09.799> and<00:04:09.980> so<00:04:10.519> basically

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
cold air into the oven and so basically

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.840 
cold air into the oven and so basically
your<00:04:11.180> cake<00:04:11.450> which<00:04:11.810> is<00:04:12.019> which<00:04:12.769> is<00:04:12.799> rising<00:04:13.280> it's

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
your cake which is which is rising it's

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.020 
your cake which is which is rising it's
gonna<00:04:14.060> get<00:04:14.870> confused<00:04:15.410> and<00:04:15.769> as<00:04:16.280> it's<00:04:16.549> rising

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
gonna get confused and as it's rising

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.820 
gonna get confused and as it's rising
when<00:04:17.510> you<00:04:17.599> introduce<00:04:17.989> the<00:04:18.140> cold<00:04:18.349> air<00:04:18.560> it's

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
when you introduce the cold air it's

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.979 
when you introduce the cold air it's
going<00:04:19.310> to<00:04:19.370> deflate<00:04:19.700> and<00:04:20.030> it's<00:04:20.330> probably

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
going to deflate and it's probably

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.080 
going to deflate and it's probably
ruined<00:04:21.349> so<00:04:21.770> unless<00:04:22.039> you<00:04:22.220> open<00:04:22.520> your<00:04:22.669> oven<00:04:22.940> door

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
ruined so unless you open your oven door

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.610 
ruined so unless you open your oven door
for<00:04:23.330> like<00:04:23.450> a<00:04:23.479> split<00:04:23.900> second<00:04:24.349> and<00:04:24.470> therefore

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
for like a split second and therefore

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.130 
for like a split second and therefore
not<00:04:25.039> allowing<00:04:25.520> the<00:04:25.640> hot<00:04:25.820> air<00:04:26.060> to<00:04:26.090> go<00:04:26.450> out<00:04:26.690> I<00:04:27.050> do

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
not allowing the hot air to go out I do

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.589 
not allowing the hot air to go out I do
not<00:04:27.530> recommend<00:04:27.830> that<00:04:28.039> you<00:04:28.250> open<00:04:28.729> your<00:04:29.330> up<00:04:29.479> and

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:29.599 
not recommend that you open your up and

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:32.320 
not recommend that you open your up and
door<00:04:29.840> as<00:04:30.080> your<00:04:30.650> cake<00:04:30.860> is<00:04:31.039> baking<00:04:31.310> and<00:04:31.910> now<00:04:32.270> you

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
door as your cake is baking and now you

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.150 
door as your cake is baking and now you
might<00:04:32.660> be<00:04:32.690> asking<00:04:33.200> but<00:04:33.470> we're<00:04:33.770> supposed<00:04:33.979> to

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
might be asking but we're supposed to

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.300 
might be asking but we're supposed to
check<00:04:34.250> on<00:04:34.640> the<00:04:34.789> cake<00:04:35.200> to<00:04:36.200> see<00:04:36.349> if<00:04:36.470> it's<00:04:36.680> if<00:04:37.160> it's

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
check on the cake to see if it's if it's

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.550 
check on the cake to see if it's if it's
completely<00:04:37.849> baked<00:04:38.060> or<00:04:38.210> not<00:04:38.390> yes<00:04:39.169> you're<00:04:39.410> right

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
completely baked or not yes you're right

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.980 
completely baked or not yes you're right
but<00:04:39.830> you<00:04:39.979> should<00:04:40.130> only<00:04:40.310> do<00:04:40.640> that<00:04:40.820> when<00:04:41.419> you<00:04:41.750> are

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
but you should only do that when you are

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.219 
but you should only do that when you are
very<00:04:42.200> close<00:04:42.380> to<00:04:42.950> the<00:04:43.660> to<00:04:44.660> the<00:04:44.750> end<00:04:44.780> of<00:04:45.110> the

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
very close to the to the end of the

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:47.200 
very close to the to the end of the
baking<00:04:45.560> time<00:04:45.740> so<00:04:46.280> for<00:04:46.460> example<00:04:46.820> if<00:04:46.940> the<00:04:47.060> recipe

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
baking time so for example if the recipe

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.839 
baking time so for example if the recipe
says<00:04:47.660> bake<00:04:48.140> for<00:04:48.380> 25<00:04:48.830> minutes<00:04:49.070> you're<00:04:49.640> going<00:04:49.789> to

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:49.849 
says bake for 25 minutes you're going to

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:51.370 
says bake for 25 minutes you're going to
start<00:04:50.090> checking<00:04:50.270> at<00:04:50.570> 20<00:04:50.900> minutes<00:04:51.169> and<00:04:51.320> that

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
start checking at 20 minutes and that

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.860 
start checking at 20 minutes and that
means<00:04:52.070> that<00:04:52.220> your<00:04:52.400> cake<00:04:52.610> is<00:04:52.640> completely<00:04:53.090> risen

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
means that your cake is completely risen

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.050 
means that your cake is completely risen
it's<00:04:54.080> almost<00:04:54.380> baked<00:04:55.039> almost<00:04:55.550> ready<00:04:55.789> and

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
it's almost baked almost ready and

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.010 
it's almost baked almost ready and
therefore<00:04:57.099> even<00:04:58.099> if<00:04:58.250> you<00:04:58.490> open<00:04:59.150> the<00:04:59.360> oven<00:04:59.390> door

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
therefore even if you open the oven door

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.440 
therefore even if you open the oven door
and<00:05:00.080> you<00:05:00.470> take<00:05:00.680> it<00:05:00.830> out<00:05:00.950> it<00:05:01.340> will<00:05:01.880> not<00:05:02.090> it's

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
and you take it out it will not it's

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.659 
and you take it out it will not it's
it's<00:05:03.169> not<00:05:03.349> liquid<00:05:03.620> anymore<00:05:03.919> and<00:05:04.310> therefore<00:05:04.610> it

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
it's not liquid anymore and therefore it

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:07.839 
it's not liquid anymore and therefore it
will<00:05:04.820> not<00:05:05.169> fall<00:05:06.169> flat<00:05:06.409> and<00:05:06.800> also<00:05:07.490> just<00:05:07.729> by

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:07.849 
will not fall flat and also just by

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:09.339 
will not fall flat and also just by
looking<00:05:08.240> at<00:05:08.360> the<00:05:08.479> cake<00:05:08.690> you<00:05:08.870> know<00:05:09.020> when<00:05:09.200> it's

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:09.349 
looking at the cake you know when it's

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:11.620 
looking at the cake you know when it's
almost<00:05:09.650> ready<00:05:10.280> because<00:05:10.820> it<00:05:11.150> will<00:05:11.360> look<00:05:11.599> like

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
almost ready because it will look like

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.089 
almost ready because it will look like
it's<00:05:12.020> ready<00:05:12.200> it<00:05:12.349> will<00:05:12.440> look<00:05:12.710> like<00:05:12.860> it's

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:13.099 
it's ready it will look like it's

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:14.620 
it's ready it will look like it's
completely<00:05:13.460> baked<00:05:13.789> you<00:05:14.000> can't<00:05:14.210> see<00:05:14.450> the

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
completely baked you can't see the

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.210 
completely baked you can't see the
batter<00:05:14.810> anymore<00:05:15.289> in<00:05:15.440> the<00:05:15.530> center<00:05:15.830> of<00:05:15.919> the<00:05:16.039> cake

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
batter anymore in the center of the cake

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.969 
batter anymore in the center of the cake
so<00:05:17.120> that's<00:05:17.930> that's<00:05:18.260> how<00:05:18.530> you<00:05:18.590> know<00:05:18.800> it's

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
so that's that's how you know it's

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:21.100 
so that's that's how you know it's
almost<00:05:19.610> ready<00:05:19.849> and<00:05:20.060> then<00:05:20.300> at<00:05:20.510> that<00:05:20.690> point<00:05:20.750> you

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
almost ready and then at that point you

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.270 
almost ready and then at that point you
can<00:05:21.229> start<00:05:21.260> checking<00:05:21.650> for<00:05:22.010> it

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
can start checking for it

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.180 
can start checking for it
so<00:05:22.909> it's<00:05:23.659> true<00:05:23.870> that<00:05:23.900> in<00:05:24.200> most<00:05:24.500> of<00:05:24.650> my<00:05:24.680> videos<00:05:24.770> I

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
so it's true that in most of my videos I

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.370 
so it's true that in most of my videos I
do<00:05:25.280> not<00:05:25.490> like<00:05:25.700> to<00:05:25.849> give<00:05:25.940> an<00:05:26.120> exact<00:05:26.599> baking<00:05:27.140> time

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
do not like to give an exact baking time

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.170 
do not like to give an exact baking time
because<00:05:27.710> there<00:05:27.890> is<00:05:28.039> no<00:05:28.250> exact<00:05:28.610> baking<00:05:28.970> time

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
because there is no exact baking time

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.360 
because there is no exact baking time
the<00:05:29.720> exact<00:05:29.990> baking<00:05:30.349> time<00:05:30.530> depends<00:05:31.130> on<00:05:31.220> many

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
the exact baking time depends on many

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.100 
the exact baking time depends on many
factors<00:05:31.520> like<00:05:32.060> the<00:05:32.180> heat<00:05:32.390> of<00:05:32.510> your<00:05:32.630> oven<00:05:32.900> the

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
factors like the heat of your oven the

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.100 
factors like the heat of your oven the
size<00:05:33.320> of<00:05:33.440> your<00:05:33.560> pan<00:05:33.740> etc<00:05:34.190> but<00:05:34.940> I<00:05:35.360> always<00:05:35.720> give

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
size of your pan etc but I always give

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.370 
size of your pan etc but I always give
an<00:05:36.260> approximate<00:05:36.590> baking<00:05:37.460> time<00:05:37.729> and<00:05:37.970> it's<00:05:38.510> with

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
an approximate baking time and it's with

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.990 
an approximate baking time and it's with
this<00:05:39.530> approximate<00:05:40.190> baking<00:05:40.520> time<00:05:40.700> that<00:05:40.880> you

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
this approximate baking time that you

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.790 
this approximate baking time that you
could<00:05:41.180> use<00:05:41.390> as<00:05:41.570> an<00:05:41.690> indication<00:05:42.169> to<00:05:42.470> start

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
could use as an indication to start

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.680 
could use as an indication to start
checking<00:05:43.039> for<00:05:43.400> the<00:05:43.820> doneness<00:05:44.030> of<00:05:44.300> your<00:05:44.479> cake

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
checking for the doneness of your cake

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.200 
checking for the doneness of your cake
now<00:05:45.590> there<00:05:45.830> is<00:05:45.950> another<00:05:46.130> tip<00:05:46.640> which<00:05:46.880> I<00:05:47.060> will

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
now there is another tip which I will

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.980 
now there is another tip which I will
call<00:05:47.390> tip

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
call tip

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.620 
call tip
3a<00:05:48.400> because<00:05:49.400> it's<00:05:49.580> actually<00:05:49.909> related<00:05:50.090> to<00:05:50.360> tip

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
3a because it's actually related to tip

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.890 
3a because it's actually related to tip
number<00:05:50.810> three<00:05:51.169> is<00:05:51.580> that<00:05:52.580> if<00:05:52.849> you<00:05:53.030> are<00:05:53.060> going<00:05:53.690> to

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
number three is that if you are going to

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.690 
number three is that if you are going to
bake<00:05:54.110> two<00:05:54.409> cakes<00:05:54.440> at<00:05:54.890> the<00:05:54.979> same<00:05:55.190> time<00:05:55.400> in<00:05:55.580> your

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 
bake two cakes at the same time in your

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.930 
bake two cakes at the same time in your
oven<00:05:55.909> make<00:05:56.720> sure<00:05:56.990> that<00:05:57.409> you<00:05:58.190> use<00:05:58.490> the<00:05:58.729> same

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
oven make sure that you use the same

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.480 
oven make sure that you use the same
type<00:05:59.240> of<00:05:59.270> pan<00:05:59.720> on<00:05:59.960> the<00:06:00.110> same<00:06:00.320> the<00:06:00.710> same<00:06:00.919> size<00:06:01.220> of

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
type of pan on the same the same size of

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.839 
type of pan on the same the same size of
pan<00:06:01.729> because<00:06:02.419> what<00:06:02.840> happens<00:06:03.200> is<00:06:03.380> if<00:06:04.220> you<00:06:04.580> use

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:04.849 
pan because what happens is if you use

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:07.000 
pan because what happens is if you use
two<00:06:05.390> different<00:06:05.599> size<00:06:05.990> pans<00:06:06.260> like<00:06:06.500> a<00:06:06.530> small<00:06:06.860> one

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.010 
two different size pans like a small one

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.190 
two different size pans like a small one
and<00:06:07.130> a<00:06:07.220> big<00:06:07.250> one<00:06:07.400> the<00:06:08.060> amount<00:06:08.360> of<00:06:08.450> batter<00:06:08.690> here

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:09.200 
and a big one the amount of batter here

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.200 
and a big one the amount of batter here
is<00:06:09.349> much<00:06:10.010> less<00:06:10.310> than<00:06:10.520> the<00:06:10.669> amount<00:06:10.849> of<00:06:11.000> batter

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
is much less than the amount of batter

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.390 
is much less than the amount of batter
and<00:06:11.450> this<00:06:11.599> one<00:06:11.810> so<00:06:12.320> what<00:06:12.470> will<00:06:12.620> happen<00:06:12.650> is<00:06:13.039> when

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
and this one so what will happen is when

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.969 
and this one so what will happen is when
you<00:06:13.520> bake<00:06:13.820> your<00:06:13.849> cake<00:06:14.240> this<00:06:14.870> one<00:06:15.200> will<00:06:15.530> require

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:15.979 
you bake your cake this one will require

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:20.110 
you bake your cake this one will require
much<00:06:16.610> much<00:06:16.909> less<00:06:17.180> time<00:06:17.419> than<00:06:17.500> this<00:06:18.500> one<00:06:18.740> and<00:06:19.550> so

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 
much much less time than this one and so

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.540 
much much less time than this one and so
as<00:06:20.870> they<00:06:21.260> are<00:06:21.349> baking<00:06:21.620> this<00:06:21.979> one<00:06:22.190> were<00:06:22.340> is

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.550 
as they are baking this one were is

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.490 
as they are baking this one were is
going<00:06:22.760> to<00:06:22.820> bake<00:06:23.180> it's<00:06:23.479> going<00:06:23.870> to<00:06:23.930> get<00:06:24.289> ready

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:24.500 
going to bake it's going to get ready

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.439 
going to bake it's going to get ready
much<00:06:24.770> faster<00:06:25.280> than<00:06:25.520> this<00:06:25.699> one<00:06:25.940> and<00:06:26.150> so<00:06:26.300> what

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:26.449 
much faster than this one and so what

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:28.360 
much faster than this one and so what
you<00:06:26.570> will<00:06:26.690> do<00:06:26.840> is<00:06:27.020> you're<00:06:27.169> going<00:06:27.380> to<00:06:27.500> open<00:06:27.800> your

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:28.370 
you will do is you're going to open your

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:29.090 
you will do is you're going to open your
oven<00:06:28.669> to<00:06:28.699> start

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:29.100 
oven to start

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.950 
oven to start
checking<00:06:29.370> on<00:06:29.460> this<00:06:29.610> one<00:06:29.790> but<00:06:30.030> we<00:06:30.450> go<00:06:30.600> back<00:06:30.750> to

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 
checking on this one but we go back to

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.200 
checking on this one but we go back to
the<00:06:31.080> same<00:06:31.230> issue<00:06:31.440> if<00:06:31.890> you<00:06:32.400> oh<00:06:32.430> if<00:06:32.730> you<00:06:32.850> do<00:06:32.970> that

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210 
the same issue if you oh if you do that

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.030 
the same issue if you oh if you do that
then<00:06:33.420> you're<00:06:33.570> introducing<00:06:34.140> hot<00:06:34.350> air<00:06:34.620> into<00:06:34.950> the

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:35.040 
then you're introducing hot air into the

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.310 
then you're introducing hot air into the
up<00:06:35.190> sorry<00:06:35.940> you're<00:06:36.270> introducing<00:06:36.750> cold<00:06:37.020> air

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:37.320 
up sorry you're introducing cold air

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.370 
up sorry you're introducing cold air
into<00:06:37.590> the<00:06:37.710> oven<00:06:38.010> and<00:06:38.160> therefore<00:06:38.910> this<00:06:39.060> one

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:39.380 
into the oven and therefore this one

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.840
