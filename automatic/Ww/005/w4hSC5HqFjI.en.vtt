00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:54.299 
know it's always nice just to get out

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:56.270 
know it's always nice just to get out
and<00:00:54.720> explore<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.379> city<00:00:55.559> find<00:00:56.010> some<00:00:56.189> new

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
restaurants and so every time I'm here I

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.130 
restaurants and so every time I'm here I
try<00:00:59.519> to<00:00:59.549> do<00:00:59.729> something<00:00:59.970> along<00:01:00.299> those<00:01:00.510> lines<00:01:00.629> I

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
try to do something along those lines I

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.850 
try to do something along those lines I
guess<00:01:01.830> just<00:01:02.040> in<00:01:02.250> general<00:01:02.400> I<00:01:03.530> feel<00:01:04.530> like<00:01:04.619> I've

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
guess just in general I feel like I've

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.100 
guess just in general I feel like I've
had<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.339> very<00:01:05.580> up-and-down<00:01:06.210> tournament<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.080> far

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
had a very up-and-down tournament so far

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.550 
had a very up-and-down tournament so far
but<00:01:07.680> I've<00:01:08.009> had<00:01:08.610> some<00:01:08.909> critical<00:01:09.900> opportunities

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
but I've had some critical opportunities

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.210 
but I've had some critical opportunities
to<00:01:10.950> win<00:01:11.670> some<00:01:11.909> games<00:01:12.119> which<00:01:12.890> hasn't<00:01:13.890> quite

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
to win some games which hasn't quite

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.249 
to win some games which hasn't quite
worked<00:01:14.280> out<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.790> certainly<00:01:15.780> should<00:01:15.900> have<00:01:16.110> beat

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
worked out I certainly should have beat

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.160 
worked out I certainly should have beat
marco<00:01:16.909> and<00:01:17.909> yesterday<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.390> was<00:01:18.840> quite<00:01:19.140> the

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
marco and yesterday I was quite the

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.249 
marco and yesterday I was quite the
better<00:01:19.530> if<00:01:19.680> not<00:01:19.860> winning<00:01:20.220> at<00:01:20.340> some<00:01:20.549> point<00:01:20.909> so

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
better if not winning at some point so

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.440 
better if not winning at some point so
it's<00:01:22.259> very<00:01:22.470> disappointing<00:01:23.000> when<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.270> have

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
it's very disappointing when you have

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.700 
it's very disappointing when you have
the<00:01:24.689> opportunities<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.560> don't

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
the opportunities and you don't

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.010 
the opportunities and you don't
capitalize<00:01:26.370> but<00:01:27.090> it's<00:01:27.390> still<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.720> long

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
capitalize but it's still a long

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.790 
capitalize but it's still a long
tournament<00:01:28.530> and

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
tournament and

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.650

probably winning for him but it's not
just<00:02:00.220> it's<00:02:00.460> not<00:02:01.000> just<00:02:01.120> dead<00:02:01.510> loss<00:02:01.870> like<00:02:02.230> it<00:02:02.380> is

six<00:02:12.970> and<00:02:13.060> a<00:02:13.150> half<00:02:13.180> hours<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:14.110> mistakes<00:02:14.950> are

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
six and a half hours and mistakes are

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.620 
six and a half hours and mistakes are
going<00:02:15.220> to<00:02:15.280> happen<00:02:15.730> at<00:02:15.910> that<00:02:15.940> point<00:02:16.450> of<00:02:16.540> the

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
going to happen at that point of the

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.410 
going to happen at that point of the
game<00:02:16.660> so<00:02:17.460> even<00:02:18.460> even<00:02:18.550> though<00:02:18.790> you<00:02:18.850> didn't<00:02:19.270> see

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
game so even even though you didn't see

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.290 
game so even even though you didn't see
that<00:02:19.450> when<00:02:19.930> they're<00:02:20.890> still<00:02:21.130> wrote<00:02:21.400> almost

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
that when they're still wrote almost

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.180 
that when they're still wrote almost
anything<00:02:22.690> was<00:02:22.930> winning<00:02:23.170> at<00:02:23.290> that<00:02:23.440> point<00:02:23.800> so<00:02:23.920> I

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
anything was winning at that point so I

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.780 
anything was winning at that point so I
got<00:02:24.970> a<00:02:25.000> bit<00:02:25.180> lucky<00:02:25.390> not<00:02:25.750> to<00:02:25.810> lose<00:02:26.650> and

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.290 

that's<00:02:30.790> it's<00:02:31.180> big<00:02:31.540> I<00:02:32.520> don't<00:02:33.520> know<00:02:33.580> how<00:02:33.760> to<00:02:34.000> put

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
that's it's big I don't know how to put

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.290 
that's it's big I don't know how to put
it<00:02:34.330> I<00:02:34.510> definitely<00:02:35.080> got<00:02:35.380> very<00:02:35.620> lucky<00:02:35.860> and

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
it I definitely got very lucky and

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.520 
it I definitely got very lucky and
hopefully<00:02:37.300> I'm<00:02:37.360> knockin<00:02:37.720> he's<00:02:37.930> had<00:02:38.080> kind<00:02:38.349> of<00:02:38.410> a

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
hopefully I'm knockin he's had kind of a

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.339 
hopefully I'm knockin he's had kind of a
lot<00:02:38.680> to<00:02:38.830> get<00:02:39.010> in<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.280> tournament<00:02:40.349> regardless

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
lot to get in the tournament regardless

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:42.809 
lot to get in the tournament regardless
of<00:02:41.470> table<00:02:41.739> bases<00:02:42.160> I<00:02:42.280> mean<00:02:42.459> I<00:02:42.550> should<00:02:42.730> have

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
of table bases I mean I should have

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.000 
of table bases I mean I should have
actually<00:02:43.000> won<00:02:43.330> that<00:02:43.569> end<00:02:43.750> game<00:02:44.080> against<00:02:44.770> like

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
actually won that end game against like

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
actually won that end game against like
oh<00:02:45.040> and<00:02:46.709> it's<00:02:47.709> very<00:02:47.920> it's<00:02:48.489> very<00:02:48.610> difficult

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
oh and it's very it's very difficult

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.390 
oh and it's very it's very difficult
from<00:02:49.420> a<00:02:49.450> psychological<00:02:49.900> standpoint<00:02:50.470> when<00:02:51.190> you

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
from a psychological standpoint when you

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.160 
from a psychological standpoint when you
are<00:02:51.850> that<00:02:52.270> close<00:02:52.510> to<00:02:52.840> a<00:02:52.870> wet<00:02:53.110> and<00:02:53.290> then

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
are that close to a wet and then

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.690 
are that close to a wet and then
the<00:02:54.920> one<00:02:55.670> wrong<00:02:55.910> which<00:02:56.330> doesn't<00:02:56.690> win

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
the one wrong which doesn't win

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.910 
the one wrong which doesn't win
in<00:02:57.819> a<00:02:57.879> given<00:02:58.180> position<00:02:58.270> so<00:02:59.020> you<00:03:01.680> know<00:03:02.680> it's

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
in a given position so you know it's

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.300 
in a given position so you know it's
it's<00:03:03.660> it's<00:03:04.660> difficult<00:03:05.110> because<00:03:05.319> once<00:03:06.190> again

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
it's it's difficult because once again

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.369 
it's it's difficult because once again
because<00:03:06.879> the<00:03:06.940> computers<00:03:07.420> every<00:03:07.690> position<00:03:07.959> it

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:08.379 
because the computers every position it

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:10.979 
because the computers every position it
just<00:03:08.920> seems<00:03:09.099> so<00:03:09.280> easy<00:03:09.569> everyone<00:03:10.569> knows<00:03:10.780> what's

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
just seems so easy everyone knows what's

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.020 
just seems so easy everyone knows what's
going<00:03:11.290> on<00:03:11.470> and<00:03:12.040> frankly<00:03:12.580> the<00:03:12.700> ins<00:03:12.819> they<00:03:12.910> know

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
going on and frankly the ins they know

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.490 
going on and frankly the ins they know
it's<00:03:13.180> coming<00:03:13.330> out<00:03:13.510> better<00:03:13.720> than<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:14.349> best

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
it's coming out better than the best

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.930 
it's coming out better than the best
players<00:03:14.800> in<00:03:14.860> the<00:03:14.980> world<00:03:15.040> this<00:03:15.489> because<00:03:15.760> of<00:03:15.819> how

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
players in the world this because of how

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.380 
players in the world this because of how
strong<00:03:16.269> the<00:03:17.050> engines<00:03:17.349> are<00:03:17.560> but<00:03:17.950> still<00:03:18.940> when

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
strong the engines are but still when

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.449 
strong the engines are but still when
you<00:03:19.480> look<00:03:19.660> at<00:03:19.840> just<00:03:20.830> from<00:03:21.069> a<00:03:21.130> practical

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
you look at just from a practical

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.940 
you look at just from a practical
standpoint<00:03:21.940> you<00:03:22.300> you<00:03:22.510> reach<00:03:22.720> position<00:03:23.290> there

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
standpoint you you reach position there

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.440 
standpoint you you reach position there
still<00:03:24.190> are<00:03:24.250> a<00:03:24.340> lot<00:03:24.580> of<00:03:24.610> mistakes<00:03:24.910> being<00:03:25.360> made

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
still are a lot of mistakes being made

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.400 
still are a lot of mistakes being made
by<00:03:26.400> by<00:03:27.400> a<00:03:27.640> lot<00:03:28.120> of<00:03:28.269> players<00:03:28.510> and<00:03:28.629> we<00:03:28.900> all<00:03:29.260> are

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
by by a lot of players and we all are

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.890 
by by a lot of players and we all are
making<00:03:29.739> these<00:03:29.860> very<00:03:30.130> slight<00:03:30.900> inaccuracies

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
making these very slight inaccuracies

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.830 
making these very slight inaccuracies
which<00:03:32.230> the<00:03:32.410> computers<00:03:32.830> see<00:03:33.040> right<00:03:33.220> away<00:03:33.340> so<00:03:33.840> i

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
which the computers see right away so i

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.630 
which the computers see right away so i
think<00:03:35.319> really<00:03:35.590> for<00:03:35.890> me<00:03:36.010> it's<00:03:36.160> just<00:03:36.190> like<00:03:36.430> get

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
think really for me it's just like get

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.280 
think really for me it's just like get
getting<00:03:37.000> positions<00:03:37.480> and<00:03:37.660> then<00:03:37.930> trying<00:03:38.170> to

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
getting positions and then trying to

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.470 
getting positions and then trying to
play<00:03:38.440> chess<00:03:38.709> and

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
play chess and

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.440 
play chess and
it's<00:03:41.080> not<00:03:41.470> going<00:03:42.459> my<00:03:42.610> way<00:03:42.790> but<00:03:42.849> they're

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
it's not going my way but they're

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.559 
it's not going my way but they're
they're<00:03:43.690> still<00:03:43.959> six<00:03:44.799> five<00:03:45.190> six<00:03:45.220> more<00:03:45.700> games<00:03:45.849> so

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
they're still six five six more games so

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:50.380 
they're still six five six more games so
it's<00:03:48.079> not<00:03:48.200> not<00:03:48.469> that<00:03:48.680> big<00:03:48.859> of<00:03:48.890> a<00:03:49.010> deal<00:03:49.189> I<00:03:49.430> don't

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
it's not not that big of a deal I don't

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.839 
it's not not that big of a deal I don't
know<00:03:50.510> if<00:03:50.689> there's<00:03:51.010> it's<00:03:52.010> a<00:03:52.129> liability<00:03:52.370> and

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
know if there's it's a liability and

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:54.640 
know if there's it's a liability and
that<00:03:52.999> I<00:03:53.030> overvalue<00:03:53.900> positions<00:03:54.290> i<00:03:54.379> think<00:03:54.560> the

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
that I overvalue positions i think the

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.800 
that I overvalue positions i think the
big<00:03:54.799> drawback<00:03:55.370> to<00:03:55.400> playing<00:03:56.180> the<00:03:56.450> way<00:03:56.569> that<00:03:56.780> i

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
big drawback to playing the way that i

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.520 
big drawback to playing the way that i
play<00:03:57.139> is<00:03:57.319> that<00:03:57.400> it's<00:03:58.400> I<00:03:59.389> don't<00:04:00.379> know<00:04:00.439> if

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
play is that it's I don't know if

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.559 
play is that it's I don't know if
stressful<00:04:01.040> the<00:04:01.159> right<00:04:01.310> word<00:04:01.609> but<00:04:01.879> it<00:04:01.999> takes<00:04:02.450> a

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
stressful the right word but it takes a

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.000 
stressful the right word but it takes a
lot<00:04:02.780> of<00:04:02.810> energy<00:04:03.109> and<00:04:04.420> and<00:04:05.420> so<00:04:05.689> you<00:04:06.560> know<00:04:06.590> I'm<00:04:06.769> if

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
lot of energy and and so you know I'm if

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.379 
lot of energy and and so you know I'm if
I<00:04:07.159> make<00:04:07.370> a<00:04:07.400> couple<00:04:07.730> of<00:04:07.790> mistakes<00:04:07.969> like<00:04:08.329> a

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:08.389 
I make a couple of mistakes like a

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:11.050 
I make a couple of mistakes like a
yesterday<00:04:08.959> and<00:04:09.109> you<00:04:09.769> know<00:04:09.920> I<00:04:09.950> I<00:04:10.219> knew<00:04:10.790> that<00:04:11.000> I

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
yesterday and you know I I knew that I

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.449 
yesterday and you know I I knew that I
was<00:04:11.209> winning<00:04:11.389> right<00:04:12.200> around<00:04:12.379> time<00:04:12.680> or<00:04:13.099> not<00:04:13.400> at

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.099 
was winning right around time or not at
time<00:04:13.879> throw<00:04:14.090> by<00:04:14.239> knew<00:04:14.419> that<00:04:14.569> I<00:04:14.659> missed<00:04:15.019> the

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:15.109 
time throw by knew that I missed the

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:16.990 
time throw by knew that I missed the
winning<00:04:15.260> human<00:04:15.560> was<00:04:15.680> earlier<00:04:16.009> sometimes<00:04:16.849> it's

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
winning human was earlier sometimes it's

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.180 
winning human was earlier sometimes it's
very<00:04:17.030> hard<00:04:17.269> to<00:04:17.599> not<00:04:17.900> just<00:04:18.709> become<00:04:18.979> apathetic

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
very hard to not just become apathetic

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.390 
very hard to not just become apathetic
and<00:04:19.820> then<00:04:20.000> just<00:04:20.209> start<00:04:20.419> moving<00:04:21.380> I'm<00:04:22.070> making

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
and then just start moving I'm making

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.060 
and then just start moving I'm making
random<00:04:22.759> moves<00:04:23.410> so<00:04:24.410> i<00:04:24.470> think<00:04:24.800> the<00:04:24.949> real

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
random moves so i think the real

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.140 
random moves so i think the real
drawback<00:04:25.610> is<00:04:25.789> that<00:04:25.820> energy<00:04:26.599> factor<00:04:27.020> more<00:04:27.229> than

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
drawback is that energy factor more than

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.189 
drawback is that energy factor more than
confidence<00:04:29.150> itself<00:04:29.570> and<00:04:30.490> I<00:04:31.490> mean<00:04:32.419> it's<00:04:33.169> just

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
confidence itself and I mean it's just

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:34.930 
confidence itself and I mean it's just
the<00:04:33.410> way<00:04:33.590> at<00:04:33.710> playing<00:04:34.009> it's<00:04:34.460> not<00:04:34.669> going<00:04:34.789> to<00:04:34.880> be

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
the way at playing it's not going to be

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.969 
the way at playing it's not going to be
changing<00:04:35.120> anytime<00:04:35.539> soon<00:04:35.720> so<00:04:36.380> I<00:04:36.410> just<00:04:36.680> have<00:04:36.830> to

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
changing anytime soon so I just have to

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.800 
changing anytime soon so I just have to
find<00:04:37.729> a<00:04:37.910> way<00:04:37.940> to

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
find a way to

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.639 
find a way to
I<00:04:39.870> may<00:04:40.080> never<00:04:40.350> make<00:04:40.620> blunders<00:04:40.860> apparently
