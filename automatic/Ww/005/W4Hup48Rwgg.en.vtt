00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
looks a little light and he's the tip to

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.490 
looks a little light and he's the tip to
sort<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.180> smooth<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.720> down<00:00:36.750> with<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:38.000> and<00:00:39.500> we'll

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
sort of smooth it down with it and we'll

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.190 
sort of smooth it down with it and we'll
take<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.890> vertical<00:00:41.430> right<00:00:41.690> here<00:00:42.690> except<00:00:43.110> it

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
take it a vertical right here except it

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.190 
take it a vertical right here except it
looks<00:00:43.410> like<00:00:43.590> we've<00:00:43.739> got<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.920> chunk<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.700> tip

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
looks like we've got a chunk in the tip

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.870 
looks like we've got a chunk in the tip
so<00:00:46.200> if<00:00:46.620> there's<00:00:46.830> a<00:00:46.890> problem<00:00:47.160> with<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.460> you

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:47.880 
so if there's a problem with that you

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:55.510 
so if there's a problem with that you
might<00:00:48.059> just<00:00:48.270> have<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.750> remove<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.650> tip<00:00:49.980> and
