00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:06.060
 welcome to unboxing the mophie 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.340
 juice pack helium and save of course 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.990
 complete test we already have one 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.790
 few days in use had 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.679
 we've got the dark now 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.990
 although I mostly have iphone for that 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.310
 Bright is pretty hard to come by 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.560
 nevertheless in germany and that gives it 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.920
 not just helium meanwhile 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.890
 but also as an inspector is called then 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.050
 not 80 but 100 percent is me 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.150
 a bit thicker but if you already have money 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.070
 The costs 80 euros I think 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.930
 that he should be 100 then you too 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.200
 spend the 20 euros more and then wants 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.600
 I have 0.7 millimeters more 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.620
 want a bigger one online accordingly 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.239
 have battery runtime 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.309
 here you can you made her side 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.140
 if we would buy the whole thing like that 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.789
 big then that is accordingly if I 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.030
 iphone teller putting to can you 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.739
 really see that here 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.350
 yes just here just these strokes 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.250
 Here corresponds where the iphone is on and 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.840
 he once under it 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.210
 that is actually everything for the battery 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.739
 heard on the back you can see 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.660
 a little something in here 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.769
 expected 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.299
 Among other things, we should here for 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.430
 for example, six hours longer 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.560
 Three thieves can use or 30 hours 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.720
 Listening to music longer is still special 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.180
 look for seven hours extra videos 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.680
 This is especially true at one 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.240
 worldwide tour for example 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.250
 be practical or if you just go 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.540
 where to go over the weekend and then 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.310
 I take it out of the 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.979
 packaging and let's look here 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.640
 this juice pack helium for the iphone 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.259
 5 on 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.700
 Of course, there's also the older one 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.960
 model shop really very chic and 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.390
 high quality of slightly rubberized 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.280
 back the hope does not go off 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.049
 but I think with a bit 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.020
 Scratches and used is determined here 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.390
 this chic surface will soon be something, too 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.009
 look worn out 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.329
 We'll get to that soon then we'll see 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.070
 here again below if I'm here 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.439
 we have the plastic output 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.180
 bit of accessories will be eg micro usb cable 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.270
 no no conduct cable i tell 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.920
 No matter why and then we have one more 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.040
 important tool I let one more time 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.210
 We have to explain profile need it and 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.189
 of course here is a little manual what 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.180
 apparently even stuck here 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.200
 then , let's get started 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.939
 In any case, the here in 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.320
 different languages again the short one 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.179
 used with leds 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.940
 that will be up to 500 times, for example 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.060
 charge 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.380
 and that really reach 80 and that 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.550
 for the first time, for example, two 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.580
 but has to recharge for three hours 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.740
 otherwise what I find very convenient 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.360
 is that it is with me his computer 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.010
 plug in via micro usb then 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.880
 automatically the iphone member and 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:31.300
 not only the so this juice pack here 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.040
 charging and thus no cable 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.270
 More need that's the reason 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.040
 why no micro like its micro usb 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.140
 cable was in there we can see here 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.400
 preparation adapter in there but here and 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.170
 if it is really only via micro 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.620
 connect usb to the computer and 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.150
 already we will charge our iphone 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.270
 could have to transfer data 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:52.420
 but then according to this 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:55.180
 wlan sync to make over micro usb 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.890
 Unfortunately, the protocol can not here 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.050
 that we used that too here 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.410
 then charge accordingly and 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.970
 no matter how much we love that is unfortunately 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.650
 a feature we like to do here 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.800
 they would have the s3 for example 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.840
 but works here with the iphone 5 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.160
 unfortunately not then can see again 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.750
 The cover is the fancy if I am here 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.120
 behind the whole anmache then you see 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.530
 here's the whole thing on green that's it 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.970
 on red when I press once you see 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.160
 you that is charged and there is here 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.360
 really, almost nothing at all 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.880
 Of course , the hole is still down here 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.110
 because apple has with the iphone 5 now 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.720
 bypassed the headphone jack 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.070
 made and I am trying here now 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.050
 Do not open it all up like this 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.280
 bottom falls the iphone you have here 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.050
 just push in for a moment 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.750
 we can see how we have a 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.860
 few small rubber feet in it that they open 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.510
 the back if dust or something 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.209
 Incidentally, it also comes in very soft inside 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.220
 gummed feels very good to that 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.790
 whole country of course does not match 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.340
 scratched 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:53.080
 which would put this in here would need that 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:56.410
 here only to do here so it is 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.239
 it does not fall out it almost wobbles 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.200
 nothing up to this little switch 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.630
 you can hear a bit behind there 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.580
 partly wobbles worse than it does 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.040
 here at the samsung galaxy s3 listening 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.260
 one up here and another on the right 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.150
 the buttons wiggle the iphone 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.430
 We can actually do the real buttons 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.080
 which are appropriate to use the 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.310
 at the volume not so bad 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.450
 So here we come 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.709
 wonderful but I find it in the 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.560
 very uncomfortable with the switch 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.150
 because you can 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.669
 so here with the finger so not really 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.440
 On it you really have to be here already 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.790
 accordingly with the fingertip here 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.930
 to do that on or on 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.970
 It's not so bad at all 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.130
 but it is the front when making out 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.360
 then a bit disturbing what I am 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.860
 it is still nice that we are in the front 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.510
 that means a little lip too 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.760
 if the device times so on the display 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.440
 should drive only if larger stones 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.550
 Scratched lying on the floor is here 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.220
 is at least half 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.960
 millimeter what the whole here from the ground 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.250
 stopped and otherwise you can see here 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.810
 already the problem I could do here now 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.880
 hard my headphones now 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.169
 even lying in the background and me 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.630
 really need this adapter from 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:55.430
 mophie has to infect little and first 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.780
 then i can main here in every direction 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.150
 plug in headphones but we see 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.860
 This can change phone to everyone 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.570
 case once again in the length not only 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.310
 so much for that but overall so much 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.389
 What a pity if you think so 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.800
 music can not obviously different 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:08.240
 solve by lightning connection and the 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:12.590
 whole electronics boys must be in it 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:14.210
 but at least that the micro arrives and 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:18.460
 Of course, the speakers still have to 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:20.600
 wonderful here by the two small ones 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.669
 passages here they are not quite 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.500
 as here has metal connections 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:25.910
 that here but not when 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.690
 one 's production gets there very fast 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.330
 charged 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.530
 there it goes a little faster and faster 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.580
 otherwise yes we can see if I am 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.930
 right now here's just the one 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.950
 on the back aiming out briefly what 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:38.690
 Once taxed look on then say 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.520
 you see the same is loading and it 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.590
 becomes short and the profi works 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.140
 wonderful I'm 80 percent 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:47.180
 come but only to about 70 to 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.919
 75 where I wanted to recharge it once 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.210
 and the camera will be here, too 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:52.729
 not affected she is again 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.470
 the whole something gummed like only the 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:56.570
 back so that works here 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:57.800
 Also very good, that was the mophie 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.380
 helium in different colors 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.300
 available for 30 euros with some 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.160
 accessories for 80 euros 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.720
 i think it's not bad i would 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.979
 not necessarily more than 50 euros for it 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.450
 I have to spend that too 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:10.250
 Of course the iphone is still one 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:13.340
 bit of protection gets and so you can 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.840
 you of course expensive display change 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.580
 or the like even save 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.580
 opinion portal fans has watched
