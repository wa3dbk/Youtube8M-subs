the particular products that i use i do

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.469 
the particular products that i use i do
use<00:00:50.320> the<00:00:50.559> bar<00:00:50.710> keeper's<00:00:51.190> friend<00:00:51.339> and<00:00:51.879> i<00:00:52.210> have

use the bar keeper's friend and i have

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:55.079 
use the bar keeper's friend and i have
not<00:00:52.780> found<00:00:53.170> that<00:00:53.710> it<00:00:53.829> does<00:00:54.579> any<00:00:54.760> type<00:00:55.059> of

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.089 
not found that it does any type of

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:57.060 
not found that it does any type of
scratching<00:00:55.839> it's<00:00:56.079> pretty<00:00:56.409> safe<00:00:56.649> on<00:00:56.920> the

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
scratching it's pretty safe on the

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.709 
scratching it's pretty safe on the
surface<00:00:57.460> I<00:00:57.640> think<00:00:57.850> it<00:00:57.940> even<00:00:58.030> will<00:00:58.300> say<00:00:58.449> it<00:00:58.600> on

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719

surface I think it even will say it on
the<00:00:58.750> back<00:00:58.989> that<00:00:59.019> you<00:00:59.289> can<00:00:59.500> use<00:00:59.680> it<00:00:59.710> for

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
the back that you can use it for

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.240 
the back that you can use it for
