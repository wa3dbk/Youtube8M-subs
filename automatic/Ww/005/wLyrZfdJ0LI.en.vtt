river<00:00:40.410> sweet<00:00:42.390> monster<00:00:43.390> hockey<00:00:48.600> battery

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.260 

wonder<00:01:00.270> how<00:01:00.360> I<00:01:00.420> get<00:01:00.600> up<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.720> the<00:01:00.930> battery<00:01:01.110> I

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
wonder how I get up to the battery I

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:15.530 
wonder how I get up to the battery I
don't<00:01:03.270> care<00:01:13.340> come<00:01:14.340> on<00:01:14.520> more<00:01:14.880> radioactive

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
don't care come on more radioactive

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
I think that's how I think we use the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:41.389 
I think that's how I think we use the
rocketry<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:35.009> get<00:01:35.159> across<00:01:35.430> those<00:01:35.820> are<00:01:40.399> cashier

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
rocketry to get across those are cashier
