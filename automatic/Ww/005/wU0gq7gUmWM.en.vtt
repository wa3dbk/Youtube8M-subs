this<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.140> panic<00:00:52.530> button<00:00:53.300> you<00:00:54.300> know<00:00:54.420> Morse

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
this is the panic button you know Morse

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.389 
this is the panic button you know Morse
code<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.829> know<00:00:57.500> three<00:00:58.500> dots<00:00:58.739> lead<00:00:59.010> -<00:00:59.190> these

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
code you know three dots lead - these

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.369 
code you know three dots lead - these
three<00:00:59.579> dots<00:00:59.820> below<00:01:00.239> be<00:01:00.989> sure<00:01:01.020> you're<00:01:01.320> not

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
three dots below be sure you're not

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.869 
three dots below be sure you're not
gonna<00:01:01.559> fall<00:01:01.800> out<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.190> I'm<00:01:02.340> quite<00:01:02.489> sure<00:01:02.730> of

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
gonna fall out of it I'm quite sure of

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.700 
gonna fall out of it I'm quite sure of
that<00:01:03.000> because<00:01:03.480> if<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.960> takes<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.320> long<00:01:04.530> time

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
that because if it takes is a long time

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.679 
that because if it takes is a long time
to<00:01:04.830> get<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.220> but<00:01:05.909> now<00:01:06.210> it's<00:01:06.360> just<00:01:06.450> if

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
to get you in but now it's just if

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.840 
to get you in but now it's just if
you're<00:01:06.810> feeling<00:01:07.320> some<00:01:07.439> discomfort<00:01:07.590> or<00:01:08.490> like

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
you're feeling some discomfort or like

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.130 
you're feeling some discomfort or like
you<00:01:08.939> think<00:01:09.090> this<00:01:09.360> is<00:01:09.540> too<00:01:09.720> fast

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
you think this is too fast

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.149 
you think this is too fast
yeah<00:01:10.290> I'm<00:01:10.350> sure<00:01:10.560> you're<00:01:10.680> not<00:01:10.770> going<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.010> think

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
yeah I'm sure you're not going to think

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.070 
yeah I'm sure you're not going to think
it's<00:01:11.250> too<00:01:11.340> fast<00:01:11.520> cuz<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.820> car<00:01:11.970> handles<00:01:12.390> well

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
it's too fast cuz the car handles well

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.929 
it's too fast cuz the car handles well
I'm<00:01:13.320> sure<00:01:13.500> it'll<00:01:13.740> be<00:01:13.799> pretty<00:01:14.340> similar<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.729> the

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
I'm sure it'll be pretty similar to the

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.960 
I'm sure it'll be pretty similar to the
real<00:01:15.090> thing<00:01:15.560> if<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.710> see<00:01:16.920> me<00:01:17.070> do<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.549> with<00:01:17.820> my

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
real thing if you see me do that with my

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.730 
real thing if you see me do that with my
right<00:01:18.210> foot<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.720> means<00:01:18.930> give<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.290> some<00:01:19.530> welly

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
right foot it means give it some welly

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.160 
right foot it means give it some welly
what<00:01:20.580> K<00:01:20.820> means<00:01:21.030> are<00:01:21.180> not<00:01:21.299> going<00:01:21.509> fast<00:01:21.750> enough

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
what K means are not going fast enough

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:37.910 
what K means are not going fast enough
okay

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920

sitting there you don't really know what

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.780 
sitting there you don't really know what
to<00:01:40.050> expect<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.920> suddenly<00:01:41.370> you<00:01:41.490> get<00:01:41.640> this

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790
