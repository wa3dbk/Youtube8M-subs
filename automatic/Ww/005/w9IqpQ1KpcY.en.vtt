January<00:00:50.430> 22nd<00:00:51.260> 1998<00:00:52.260> Tuesday<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.340> think<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.090> just

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
January 22nd 1998 Tuesday I think I just

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.459 
January 22nd 1998 Tuesday I think I just
saw<00:00:54.420> something<00:00:54.750> moving<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.230> shadow

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
saw something moving in the shadow

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.040 
saw something moving in the shadow
behind<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.039> tree<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:57.000> looked<00:00:57.300> dark<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.780> small

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
behind the tree it looked dark and small

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.160 
behind the tree it looked dark and small
like<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.350> gengar<00:00:58.649> but<00:00:59.280> eyeless<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.239> wonder<00:01:00.989> if<00:01:01.079> it

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
like a gengar but eyeless I wonder if it

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.049 
like a gengar but eyeless I wonder if it
was<00:01:01.320> just<00:01:01.590> because<00:01:01.949> my<00:01:02.100> lack<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.489> sleep<00:01:02.789> or

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
was just because my lack of sleep or

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.719 
was just because my lack of sleep or
what<00:01:03.300> anyway<00:01:04.290> I've<00:01:04.559> managed<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.220> make<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.610> all

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
what anyway I've managed to make it all

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.609 
what anyway I've managed to make it all
the<00:01:05.760> way<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:05.970> phrygian<00:01:06.510> City<00:01:06.810> but<00:01:07.290> that's<00:01:07.470> not

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
the way to phrygian City but that's not

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.350 
the way to phrygian City but that's not
saying<00:01:07.830> much<00:01:07.950> considering<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.060> indigo

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
saying much considering that the indigo

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.030 
saying much considering that the indigo
plateau<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:10.049> right<00:01:10.260> next<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.560> Viridian

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
plateau is right next to Viridian

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.609 
plateau is right next to Viridian
Viridian<00:01:11.909> Forest<00:01:11.939> will<00:01:12.420> be<00:01:12.510> fun<00:01:12.810> maybe<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.470> can

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
Viridian Forest will be fun maybe I can

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:14.840 
Viridian Forest will be fun maybe I can
make<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.860> through<00:01:13.979> without<00:01:14.250> battling<00:01:14.640> any

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
make it through without battling any

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.789 
make it through without battling any
trainers<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.659> think<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.229> should<00:01:16.380> write<00:01:16.560> more

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
trainers I think I should write more

that I haven't seen that weird shadow
lately<00:02:57.660> but<00:02:58.260> that<00:02:58.500> might<00:02:58.680> just<00:02:58.920> be<00:02:58.980> a

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
lately but that might just be a

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.830 
lately but that might just be a
hallucination<00:02:59.700> induced<00:02:59.970> by<00:03:00.450> my<00:03:00.570> lack<00:03:00.810> of
