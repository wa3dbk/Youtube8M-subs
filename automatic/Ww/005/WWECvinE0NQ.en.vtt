00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
base and you're going to see a huge

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.289 
base and you're going to see a huge
massive<00:04:18.440> army<00:04:18.799> here<00:04:19.100> that<00:04:19.820> looks<00:04:19.970> really

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
massive army here that looks really

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.580 
massive army here that looks really
really<00:04:20.570> impressive<00:04:22.750> look<00:04:23.750> at<00:04:23.840> that<00:04:23.960> huge<00:04:24.199> Zerg

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
really impressive look at that huge Zerg

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.370 
really impressive look at that huge Zerg
of<00:04:24.889> troops<00:04:25.449> archers<00:04:26.680> cannons<00:04:28.930> nights<00:04:29.930> and<00:04:30.229> we

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
of troops archers cannons nights and we

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.159 
of troops archers cannons nights and we
actually<00:04:30.500> failed<00:04:31.060> we<00:04:32.060> failed<00:04:32.090> the<00:04:32.720> base<00:04:32.930> rate

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
actually failed we failed the base rate

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.740 
actually failed we failed the base rate
there<00:04:33.440> we<00:04:34.310> just<00:04:34.460> needed<00:04:34.760> a<00:04:34.849> few<00:04:34.880> more<00:04:35.120> seconds

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
there we just needed a few more seconds

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.650 
there we just needed a few more seconds
so<00:04:36.530> you<00:04:36.590> can<00:04:36.740> see<00:04:36.919> they're<00:04:37.160> not<00:04:37.400> the<00:04:38.330> best

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
so you can see they're not the best

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.540 
so you can see they're not the best
strategy<00:04:38.870> to<00:04:39.289> use<00:04:39.440> but<00:04:39.800> it<00:04:39.919> sure<00:04:40.130> is<00:04:40.280> a<00:04:40.310> lot<00:04:40.490> of

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
strategy to use but it sure is a lot of

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.339 
strategy to use but it sure is a lot of
fun<00:04:40.820> and<00:04:40.970> I<00:04:41.180> did<00:04:41.330> make<00:04:41.479> a<00:04:41.510> few<00:04:41.630> mistakes<00:04:41.960> there

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:42.349 
fun and I did make a few mistakes there

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:44.020 
fun and I did make a few mistakes there
a<00:04:42.380> couple<00:04:42.680> seconds<00:04:43.010> here<00:04:43.190> and<00:04:43.310> there<00:04:43.400> so<00:04:43.849> is<00:04:44.000> a

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
a couple seconds here and there so is a

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.850 
a couple seconds here and there so is a
very<00:04:44.389> very<00:04:44.539> close<00:04:44.840> so<00:04:45.050> we<00:04:45.139> got<00:04:45.260> seventy-two

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
very very close so we got seventy-two

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.879 
very very close so we got seventy-two
percent<00:04:46.180> it's<00:04:47.180> always<00:04:47.599> fun<00:04:48.410> to<00:04:48.440> try<00:04:48.620> different

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 
percent it's always fun to try different

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.010 
percent it's always fun to try different
strategies<00:04:49.700> and<00:04:50.000> if<00:04:50.180> you<00:04:50.300> do<00:04:50.419> level<00:04:50.810> up<00:04:50.900> the

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
strategies and if you do level up the

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.990 
strategies and if you do level up the
spells<00:04:51.349> and<00:04:51.530> level<00:04:51.830> up<00:04:51.889> the<00:04:52.010> troops<00:04:52.280> you<00:04:52.849> can

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
spells and level up the troops you can

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.850 
spells and level up the troops you can
get<00:04:53.150> different<00:04:53.360> things<00:04:53.780> to<00:04:53.990> work<00:04:54.199> for<00:04:54.530> you<00:04:54.680> so

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
get different things to work for you so

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.550 
get different things to work for you so
you<00:04:54.919> don't<00:04:54.979> have<00:04:55.250> to<00:04:55.430> use<00:04:55.610> the<00:04:55.820> same<00:04:56.060> spells

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
you don't have to use the same spells

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.580 
you don't have to use the same spells
you<00:04:57.560> know<00:04:58.419> firestorm<00:04:59.419> sword<00:05:00.349> rain

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
you know firestorm sword rain

you know firestorm sword rain
hammerstrike<00:05:01.280> are<00:05:01.460> all<00:05:01.610> very<00:05:02.030> very<00:05:02.180> effective

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
hammerstrike are all very very effective

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.180 
hammerstrike are all very very effective
spells<00:05:03.050> but<00:05:03.260> you<00:05:03.349> can<00:05:03.650> mix<00:05:03.949> and<00:05:04.130> match

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
spells but you can mix and match

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.879 
spells but you can mix and match

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
different combinations and also pull off

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:10.510 
different combinations and also pull off
victories<00:05:07.460> and<00:05:08.380> sometimes<00:05:09.380> defeats<00:05:09.800> so

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
victories and sometimes defeats so

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.640 
victories and sometimes defeats so
overall<00:05:11.060> this<00:05:11.210> is<00:05:11.270> a<00:05:11.389> very<00:05:11.690> very<00:05:11.990> good<00:05:12.139> job<00:05:12.380> a

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
overall this is a very very good job a

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.219 
overall this is a very very good job a
great<00:05:13.220> base<00:05:13.460> here<00:05:13.729> um<00:05:13.910> if<00:05:14.270> we<00:05:14.419> had<00:05:14.570> just<00:05:14.599> a<00:05:14.840> few

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
great base here um if we had just a few

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:17.020 
great base here um if we had just a few
more<00:05:15.410> seconds<00:05:15.949> you<00:05:16.430> would<00:05:16.520> amount<00:05:16.699> to<00:05:16.849> kill

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
more seconds you would amount to kill

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.779 
more seconds you would amount to kill
the<00:05:17.150> gate<00:05:17.330> so<00:05:17.990> one<00:05:18.440> of<00:05:18.470> the<00:05:18.680> changes<00:05:19.010> that<00:05:19.220> you

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:19.789 
the gate so one of the changes that you

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:21.400 
the gate so one of the changes that you
will<00:05:19.940> notice<00:05:20.210> is<00:05:20.510> as<00:05:20.660> you<00:05:20.810> get<00:05:20.930> higher<00:05:21.110> you

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
will notice is as you get higher you

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.010 
will notice is as you get higher you
don't<00:05:21.590> see<00:05:21.800> spikes<00:05:22.370> spikes<00:05:23.360> they<00:05:23.630> lose<00:05:23.870> their

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
don't see spikes spikes they lose their

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.960 
don't see spikes spikes they lose their
effectiveness<00:05:24.410> around<00:05:24.949> the<00:05:25.099> thousand<00:05:25.639> trophy

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
effectiveness around the thousand trophy

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.719 
effectiveness around the thousand trophy
range<00:05:26.780> and<00:05:27.169> the<00:05:27.830> further<00:05:28.130> you<00:05:28.250> go<00:05:28.460> up<00:05:28.550> in<00:05:28.669> the

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:28.729 
range and the further you go up in the

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:30.610 
range and the further you go up in the
leaderboards<00:05:29.240> the<00:05:29.360> less<00:05:29.660> effective<00:05:30.260> spikes

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
leaderboards the less effective spikes

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.310 
leaderboards the less effective spikes
are<00:05:30.949> they<00:05:31.580> only<00:05:31.970> do<00:05:32.240> damage<00:05:32.570> to<00:05:32.599> ground<00:05:32.990> troops

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
are they only do damage to ground troops

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.990 
are they only do damage to ground troops
and<00:05:33.560> then<00:05:33.860> they<00:05:33.950> die<00:05:34.099> really<00:05:34.550> really<00:05:34.729> quick

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
and then they die really really quick

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.570 
and then they die really really quick
and<00:05:35.240> your<00:05:36.229> hero<00:05:36.530> can<00:05:36.740> normally<00:05:37.070> kill<00:05:37.280> them<00:05:37.430> in

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
and your hero can normally kill them in

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:38.030 
and your hero can normally kill them in
like

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.040 
like

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.680 
like
two<00:05:38.130> or<00:05:38.280> three<00:05:38.310> hits<00:05:38.730> or<00:05:38.940> if<00:05:39.120> he<00:05:39.180> has<00:05:39.270> spells

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
two or three hits or if he has spells

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.260 
two or three hits or if he has spells
one<00:05:40.110> hit<00:05:40.290> pretty<00:05:40.500> much<00:05:40.680> KO<00:05:40.920> so<00:05:41.700> spikes<00:05:42.030> are

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
one hit pretty much KO so spikes are

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.420 
one hit pretty much KO so spikes are
very<00:05:42.540> very<00:05:42.780> ineffective<00:05:43.230> if<00:05:43.920> you<00:05:44.100> swap<00:05:44.400> that

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
very very ineffective if you swap that

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.760 
very very ineffective if you swap that
out<00:05:44.640> for<00:05:44.940> a<00:05:45.000> barrier<00:05:45.450> or<00:05:45.480> barricade<00:05:46.200> that

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
out for a barrier or barricade that

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:47.930 
out for a barrier or barricade that
right<00:05:46.980> there<00:05:47.130> will<00:05:47.280> help<00:05:47.370> slow<00:05:47.640> down<00:05:47.760> the

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
right there will help slow down the

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.910 
right there will help slow down the
enemy<00:05:48.360> a<00:05:48.390> little<00:05:48.720> bit<00:05:48.840> more<00:05:49.080> and<00:05:49.290> prevent

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:49.920 
enemy a little bit more and prevent

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.590 
enemy a little bit more and prevent
people<00:05:50.160> from<00:05:50.190> winning<00:05:50.640> because<00:05:51.300> like<00:05:51.480> I<00:05:51.540> said

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 
people from winning because like I said

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.780 
people from winning because like I said
if<00:05:51.810> you<00:05:51.870> only<00:05:52.050> had<00:05:52.290> a<00:05:52.320> few<00:05:52.620> more<00:05:52.800> seconds<00:05:53.280> we

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:53.790 
if you only had a few more seconds we

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.100 
if you only had a few more seconds we
would<00:05:54.030> have<00:05:54.060> been<00:05:54.180> able<00:05:54.390> to<00:05:54.570> kill<00:05:54.780> that<00:05:54.900> base

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
would have been able to kill that base

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.590 
would have been able to kill that base
overall<00:05:56.100> this<00:05:56.280> is<00:05:56.430> an<00:05:56.520> excellent<00:05:56.910> base<00:05:57.180> design

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 
overall this is an excellent base design

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.900 
overall this is an excellent base design
