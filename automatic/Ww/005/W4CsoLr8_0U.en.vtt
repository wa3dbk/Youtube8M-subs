00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.520
To install MS-DOS 6.X, you will need 4 floppy disks of MS-DOS 6.X setup.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.940
4th disk is optional, because it contains supplemental utilities...

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.980
... and we'll use DOS Virtual Machine Additions ...

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.640
for *eh* ... shared folders and um...

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.860
CD-ROM access.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.140
Let's create a virtual machine first.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.060
Set the RAM at least to 64 MB.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.920
Hard drive should be set at least to 2 GB.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:39.080
More than that and then you'll have to create a extended or logical partition which will take some time.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.520
So don't bother with that.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.100
Capture first disk ...

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:48.840
... and begin setup.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.740
Press Enter (key).

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.040
Press Enter (key) again.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.240
And press Enter (key) again. For now *gibberish*...

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.440
It will now format the disk and allocate all space.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.960
If you have to change country or keyboard layout, *gibberish* change it here.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.480
Otherwise, press Enter (key).

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.420
Press Enter (key) to ...

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.340
... start installation.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.460
Note about ear rape if it happens. (It may happen during the installation.)

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.840
Now choose second disk.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.960
(Note: Short beep incoming.)

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.780
Choose third disk.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.920
(Note: Short beep incoming.)

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.920
Release the third disk and press Enter (key), press Enter again to restart.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.340
Okay, now MS-DOS 6 *gibberish* is installed ...

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.480
... but we'll install more things.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.280
So let's install supplemental utilities (capture 4th disk). Go to A: (type "A:") ...

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.760
... setup (type "setup" command) to see details, so it will install supplemental utilities (No sh*t sherlock).

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.200
Now let's type "setup C:\DOS".

00:02:15.867 --> 00:02:18.607
Choose all components. With A (key) ...

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.640
... and press F5 to choose VGA (not F6).

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.060
Press Y (key, to confirm choice), and press Y again to overwrite file (if it asks).

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.300
Okay, now that's installed. Now let's install DOS Virtual Machine Additions.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.040
Type "dosadd" ...

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.440
Press Y (key, to confirm choice).

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.380
And... it's installed. Now let's release that too.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.060
And... restart.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.600
Okay, now we have completely installed MS-DOS 6.X.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.680
And now we can share folders and use CD image files.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.660
Let's just share a *gibberish* folder ...

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.880
Use "Z:" by default (to access shared folder).

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.500
And now let's...

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.280
... open that file from the (shared) disk drive.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.340
And that's how shared folder actually kinda works.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.240
Okay, let's exit...

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.440
And that's pretty much about it. Enjoy using MS-DOS 6.X.
