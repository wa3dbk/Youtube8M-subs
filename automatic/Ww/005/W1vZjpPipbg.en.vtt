and<00:01:59.520> I<00:02:00.509> guess<00:02:00.780> other<00:02:01.020> sort<00:02:01.290> of<00:02:01.350> things<00:02:01.710> like<00:02:01.979> to

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
and I guess other sort of things like to

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.700 
and I guess other sort of things like to
gain<00:02:02.790> an<00:02:03.000> in-game<00:02:03.659> currency<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.560> can

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
gain an in-game currency so you can

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.170 
gain an in-game currency so you can
actually<00:02:04.920> go<00:02:05.219> through<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.520> game<00:02:05.700> just

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
actually go through the game just

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.169 
actually go through the game just

free-to-play and they promised they

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379

said they they said it was not gonna be
repetitive<00:02:24.440> arduous<00:02:25.440> tasks<00:02:25.860> so<00:02:26.780> hopefully

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
repetitive arduous tasks so hopefully

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.260 
repetitive arduous tasks so hopefully
that's<00:02:27.960> that's<00:02:28.350> true<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:28.760> then<00:02:29.760> also<00:02:30.000> upon

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
that's that's true and then also upon

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.940 
that's that's true and then also upon
release<00:02:30.630> unfortunately<00:02:31.530> it's<00:02:31.620> gonna<00:02:31.680> only

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
release unfortunately it's gonna only

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.780 
release unfortunately it's gonna only
have<00:02:32.660> cards<00:02:33.660> from<00:02:33.930> pretty<00:02:34.710> much<00:02:34.770> this<00:02:35.100> set<00:02:35.490> so

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
have cards from pretty much this set so

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.120 
have cards from pretty much this set so
the<00:02:36.570> generation<00:02:37.110> set<00:02:37.440> so<00:02:38.280> G<00:02:38.700> set<00:02:38.910> one<00:02:39.240> and

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
the generation set so G set one and

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.130 
the generation set so G set one and
pretty<00:02:41.130> much<00:02:41.280> anything<00:02:41.520> afterwards<00:02:42.030> but<00:02:43.020> they

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
pretty much anything afterwards but they

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.140 
pretty much anything afterwards but they
said<00:02:43.380> that<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.710> fans<00:02:44.040> that<00:02:44.700> are<00:02:44.820> looking<00:02:45.090> for

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
said that it fans that are looking for

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.450 
said that it fans that are looking for
older<00:02:45.600> cards<00:02:45.870> will<00:02:46.230> not<00:02:46.440> be<00:02:46.590> disappointed<00:02:46.770> so

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
older cards will not be disappointed so

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.910 
older cards will not be disappointed so
those<00:02:48.450> probably<00:02:49.080> might<00:02:49.350> be<00:02:49.470> something<00:02:49.800> at

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
those probably might be something at

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.480 
those probably might be something at
that<00:02:50.040> like<00:02:50.340> actually<00:02:50.940> buy<00:02:51.210> with<00:02:51.510> money<00:02:51.690> or

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
that like actually buy with money or

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.830 
that like actually buy with money or
something<00:02:53.490> along<00:02:53.640> those<00:02:53.820> lines<00:02:54.090> I<00:02:54.570> guess

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
something along those lines I guess

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.220 
something along those lines I guess
we'll<00:02:55.140> see<00:02:56.210> also<00:02:57.210> speaking<00:02:57.690> of<00:02:57.810> cards<00:02:58.080> the

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
we'll see also speaking of cards the

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.100 
we'll see also speaking of cards the
game<00:02:58.440> is<00:02:58.650> going<00:02:59.100> to<00:02:59.220> be<00:02:59.550> updated<00:03:00.360> so<00:03:00.810> all<00:03:00.960> the

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
game is going to be updated so all the

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.930 
game is going to be updated so all the
cards<00:03:01.290> in<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.470> game<00:03:01.650> will<00:03:02.190> be<00:03:02.310> updated

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
cards in the game will be updated

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.690 
cards in the game will be updated
relatively<00:03:03.720> closely<00:03:04.170> with<00:03:04.650> um<00:03:04.950> when<00:03:05.610> they

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
relatively closely with um when they

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.420 
relatively closely with um when they
come<00:03:05.850> out<00:03:05.880> in<00:03:06.090> physical<00:03:06.510> form<00:03:06.750> so<00:03:07.100> let's<00:03:08.100> say

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
come out in physical form so let's say

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.230 
come out in physical form so let's say
if<00:03:08.640> G<00:03:09.510> BT<00:03:09.990> 3<00:03:10.170> comes<00:03:10.440> out<00:03:10.590> on<00:03:10.920> you<00:03:11.730> know<00:03:11.820> August

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
if G BT 3 comes out on you know August

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.720 
if G BT 3 comes out on you know August
8th<00:03:12.420> it'll<00:03:12.900> probably<00:03:13.110> be<00:03:13.490> updated<00:03:14.490> in<00:03:14.700> the

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
8th it'll probably be updated in the

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.000 
8th it'll probably be updated in the
online<00:03:15.330> game<00:03:15.540> like<00:03:15.990> probably<00:03:16.200> a<00:03:16.410> couple<00:03:16.920> of

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
online game like probably a couple of

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.640 
online game like probably a couple of
days<00:03:17.100> if<00:03:17.250> not<00:03:17.370> a<00:03:17.460> week<00:03:17.670> later<00:03:18.170> I<00:03:19.170> guess<00:03:19.500> they

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
days if not a week later I guess they

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:20.750 
days if not a week later I guess they
just<00:03:19.770> want<00:03:19.890> to<00:03:19.950> have<00:03:20.040> that<00:03:20.190> gap<00:03:20.370> so<00:03:20.640> then

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
just want to have that gap so then

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.640 
just want to have that gap so then
people<00:03:21.000> are<00:03:21.690> just<00:03:21.870> not<00:03:22.020> like<00:03:22.170> oh<00:03:22.320> well<00:03:22.590> I'm

just gonna wait for the online game to
update<00:03:24.510> and<00:03:24.660> then<00:03:24.750> I'll<00:03:24.870> just<00:03:25.020> do<00:03:25.140> that

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280

they're<00:03:58.050> probably<00:03:58.200> gonna<00:03:58.410> have<00:03:58.530> something

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
they're probably gonna have something

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.400 
they're probably gonna have something
along<00:03:59.310> those<00:03:59.490> lines<00:03:59.930> they<00:04:00.930> said<00:04:01.110> it<00:04:01.200> was<00:04:01.320> gonna

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
along those lines they said it was gonna

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.260 
along those lines they said it was gonna
be<00:04:01.500> similar<00:04:01.950> to<00:04:01.980> that<00:04:02.280> but<00:04:02.520> not<00:04:02.670> the<00:04:02.820> exact

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
be similar to that but not the exact

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.870 
be similar to that but not the exact
same<00:04:03.300> thing<00:04:03.840> so<00:04:04.410> I<00:04:04.440> guess<00:04:04.770> we'll<00:04:04.920> see<00:04:05.100> how<00:04:05.130> that

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
same thing so I guess we'll see how that

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.360 
same thing so I guess we'll see how that
works<00:04:06.240> out<00:04:06.740> it's<00:04:07.740> also<00:04:07.830> gonna<00:04:08.040> be<00:04:08.220> all

play the game also was kind of

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.490 
play the game also was kind of
interesting<00:04:24.419> someone<00:04:24.750> asked<00:04:25.110> about<00:04:25.169> a

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
interesting someone asked about a

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.960

they<00:04:30.750> have<00:04:30.900> no<00:04:31.020> plans<00:04:31.380> for<00:04:31.500> it<00:04:32.180> but<00:04:33.180> they<00:04:33.300> might

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660
