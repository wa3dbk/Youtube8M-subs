00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.640 

there's<00:05:05.400> nothing<00:05:05.880> to<00:05:06.210> miss<00:05:06.750> their<00:05:07.020> pocket<00:05:07.470> and

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
there's nothing to miss their pocket and

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:19.580 
there's nothing to miss their pocket and
smiley<00:05:17.450> yeah<00:05:18.450> it<00:05:18.600> definitely<00:05:18.780> spent<00:05:19.350> a<00:05:19.440> long

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
smiley yeah it definitely spent a long

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.650 
smiley yeah it definitely spent a long
time<00:05:19.620> since<00:05:20.040> I've<00:05:20.220> been<00:05:20.340> under<00:05:20.580> 1000<00:05:21.210> so<00:05:21.420> it

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
time since I've been under 1000 so it

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.140 
time since I've been under 1000 so it
was<00:05:22.410> quite<00:05:22.620> strange<00:05:23.010> to<00:05:23.280> go<00:05:23.550> out<00:05:23.730> on<00:05:23.880> the<00:05:23.970> bike

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
was quite strange to go out on the bike

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.660 
was quite strange to go out on the bike
this<00:05:24.630> the<00:05:24.960> first<00:05:25.200> practice<00:05:25.620> and<00:05:25.800> then<00:05:25.920> also

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:26.670 
this the first practice and then also

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.880 
this the first practice and then also
not<00:05:27.390> really<00:05:27.630> ready<00:05:27.840> for<00:05:27.930> the<00:05:28.110> qualifying<00:05:28.590> but

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
not really ready for the qualifying but

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.160 
not really ready for the qualifying but
and<00:05:29.130> with<00:05:29.640> these<00:05:29.790> conditions<00:05:30.360> was<00:05:30.720> really

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.170 
and with these conditions was really

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:35.330 
and with these conditions was really
tricky<00:05:32.300> there's<00:05:33.300> wind<00:05:33.810> and<00:05:34.110> every<00:05:34.980> time<00:05:35.160> you

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
tricky there's wind and every time you

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.160 
tricky there's wind and every time you
go<00:05:35.460> in<00:05:35.550> to<00:05:35.640> turn<00:05:35.940> the<00:05:36.360> bike<00:05:36.690> was<00:05:36.840> trying<00:05:37.080> to

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:37.170 
go in to turn the bike was trying to

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.590 
go in to turn the bike was trying to
push<00:05:37.380> away<00:05:37.530> because<00:05:37.800> of<00:05:38.040> the<00:05:38.100> wind<00:05:38.310> so<00:05:38.600> there

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
push away because of the wind so there

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.060 
push away because of the wind so there
was<00:05:39.690> a<00:05:39.750> lot<00:05:39.780> of<00:05:39.900> crashes<00:05:40.200> out<00:05:40.530> there<00:05:40.770> and<00:05:40.980> the

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
was a lot of crashes out there and the

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.130 
was a lot of crashes out there and the
conditions<00:05:41.520> were<00:05:41.640> probably<00:05:41.970> not<00:05:42.120> ideal<00:05:42.900> but

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 
conditions were probably not ideal but

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.900 
conditions were probably not ideal but
I'm<00:05:43.650> quite<00:05:43.860> happy<00:05:44.040> with<00:05:44.190> how<00:05:44.430> the<00:05:44.490> session

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
I'm quite happy with how the session

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.080 
I'm quite happy with how the session
when<00:05:45.090> and<00:05:45.390> it's<00:05:46.110> been<00:05:46.380> being<00:05:46.980> a<00:05:47.070> fun<00:05:47.280> fun<00:05:48.060> day

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.720 
when and it's been being a fun fun day
so<00:05:48.450> far<00:05:48.480> it's<00:05:48.990> it's<00:05:49.830> a<00:05:49.980> bit<00:05:50.130> more<00:05:50.250> relaxing

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:50.730 
so far it's it's a bit more relaxing

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.630 
so far it's it's a bit more relaxing

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130 
on the track as you can see it's crazy

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.340

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
track is hard enough let alone racing

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.390 
track is hard enough let alone racing
against<00:06:12.330> other<00:06:12.510> guys<00:06:12.780> so<00:06:13.110> I'm<00:06:13.890> happy<00:06:14.130> that<00:06:14.250> I

well<00:06:19.860> better<00:06:20.250> I<00:06:20.550> didn't<00:06:20.910> have<00:06:21.060> Alex<00:06:21.420> past<00:06:21.810> me

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
well better I didn't have Alex past me

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.100 
well better I didn't have Alex past me
into<00:06:22.170> InDesign<00:06:22.860> one<00:06:23.070> so<00:06:23.400> i<00:06:23.570> was<00:06:24.570> able<00:06:24.720> to<00:06:24.960> lead

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
into InDesign one so i was able to lead

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.610 
into InDesign one so i was able to lead
from<00:06:25.380> the<00:06:25.410> first<00:06:25.710> corner<00:06:25.950> so<00:06:26.360> just<00:06:27.530> tried<00:06:28.530> to

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 
from the first corner so just tried to

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.110 
from the first corner so just tried to
keep<00:06:28.740> good<00:06:29.010> rhythm<00:06:29.340> and<00:06:29.520> i<00:06:29.640> actually<00:06:29.760> felt

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 
keep good rhythm and i actually felt

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.630 
keep good rhythm and i actually felt
better<00:06:30.330> in<00:06:30.540> that<00:06:30.660> race<00:06:30.900> mod<00:06:31.800> x<00:06:32.190> or<00:06:32.460> a<00:06:32.490> lot

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:32.640 
better in that race mod x or a lot

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.360 
better in that race mod x or a lot
faster<00:06:33.120> and<00:06:33.620> felt<00:06:34.620> quite<00:06:34.830> strong<00:06:35.160> and<00:06:35.190> i

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.370 
faster and felt quite strong and i

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:36.740 
faster and felt quite strong and i
didn't<00:06:35.610> have<00:06:35.730> as<00:06:35.880> much<00:06:35.910> problem<00:06:36.510> with<00:06:36.630> the

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:36.750 
didn't have as much problem with the

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.630 
didn't have as much problem with the
with<00:06:37.050> the<00:06:37.170> traffic<00:06:37.440> at<00:06:37.710> then<00:06:37.890> end<00:06:38.130> of<00:06:38.400> the<00:06:38.460> race

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:38.640 
with the traffic at then end of the race

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.300 
with the traffic at then end of the race
so<00:06:39.180> and<00:06:39.510> i<00:06:40.410> think<00:06:40.590> i'm<00:06:40.680> just<00:06:40.770> getting<00:06:41.070> used<00:06:41.190> to

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.310 
so and i think i'm just getting used to

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.420 
so and i think i'm just getting used to
the<00:06:41.400> wind<00:06:41.820> conditions<00:06:42.330> and<00:06:42.950> gave<00:06:43.950> everything

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:44.430 
the wind conditions and gave everything

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.360 
the wind conditions and gave everything
fit<00:06:44.760> went<00:06:44.970> smoothly<00:06:45.300> and<00:06:45.690> it's<00:06:46.620> been<00:06:46.830> a<00:06:46.860> great

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:47.370 
fit went smoothly and it's been a great

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.670 
fit went smoothly and it's been a great
opportunity<00:06:47.640> to<00:06:48.270> come<00:06:48.420> and<00:06:48.570> racy<00:06:48.720> i<00:06:48.930> want<00:06:49.590> to
