00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 nobody can make a mistake look here we 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.140
 we separate a section that tv between this and 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.090
 I put the tv inter placed, right? 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.550
 on the international website the speech of the 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.559
 argentino d'alessandro immediately 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.750
 after the rout on Sunday night in 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.940
 inside the locker room and therefore 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.430
 immediately after the achievement of the 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:30.330
 state title or followed but the ii 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:32.790
 day for me the law and I special there was the 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:38.129
 people not only from Brazil you know this 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:47.840
 did not come to me, what do you do with 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:47.840
 that you forget everything that is best so 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.260
 will not take place and nowadays it will not 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:01:01.109
 much bigger 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:03.660
 Brazil today has a little hurt today. 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:08.490
 take us out of here we get 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:11.420
 focus on the good duel for what is not 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.420
 will 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.570
 It's a dance management class. 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:19.369
 pressure management is a time of 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.729
 shiver where another has to leave his own 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.170
 international guild and I approach today in 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.520
 column I wrote in the metro newspaper at 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.409
 Wednesday I think I missed the 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.600
 I also think it's annoying. 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.640
 no connotation is of orientation 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.920
 make this clear I think 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.390
 a man lacking the style of the 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.250
 only has a big hair that has this 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.469
 personality and a technician with fidele 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.060
 example of felipe until an ok also the 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:42.649
 but the intertem has 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.329
 d'alessandro how had fernandão 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.340
 when the felipão's guild had a 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:49.159
 and had had others that the 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.130
 they supported as adilson as danrlei as 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.840
 rivarola and I think this fiber is missing 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.149
 inside the locker room was spent as 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.099
 manager and the great manager who 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.500
 do you know that the leaderships are given 

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:02.090
 for some different reasons 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.340
 the decree almost always does not work 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.599
 jesus the leaders give themselves for reasons 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.489
 of quality for psychiatric reasons and the 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:13.280
 has the good fortune to bring together 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:15.140
 the main points that lead to 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.660
 someone's leadership a leader of the 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.459
 he is the technical leader and the 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:24.109
 leader is also the 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:26.299
 technical reference is an ai ai ai ai who 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:28.819
 inspire those who mirror the 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.319
 d'alessandro giving this speech is the 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.150
 Face has to lower his head. 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.530
 who looks at own mural and saw 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.720
 d'alessandro levando is raising 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.120
 bowls seven years in English we pray 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.060
 Daniel and give two pat on the 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.579
 cup and said look here again and there 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.200
 what I see up to accept and 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.069
 But I already wanted a reaction. 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.040
 immediate 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.109
 I did not see an indignant the guild did not 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.370
 indignant the guild did not see I did not see the 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:57.769
 grêmio leaves the game gives you face to defeat 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.169
 knows and feels shame in his face and he 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:03.440
 he did not hit he hit and hit not 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:04.770
 We felt we expect in 8 fathom 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.260
 access to manga 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.870
 Mrs. nothing happened not 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.520
 For me, this is taken for granted. 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.050
 this gesture I consider that this is a 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.270
 symptomatic gesture his speech the 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.820
 clear coach is part of football and 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.880
 nothing happened we saw how we 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:24.150
 saw d'alessandro screaming in the locker room 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.830
 with the conquest there was no one from the 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:30.210
 crying in the locker room with the 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:33.030
 defeat to the Togolese team was the lady 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.430
 a great player a great player phil 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.650
 d'alessandro passed she's right he told me 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.150
 asked his profit rose from the stock had in the 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.890
 this guild nal gre I would go to the locker room 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.140
 give a speech to revive the group 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.020
 for this the guild the guild the guild 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.970
 besides not having this figure he I do not 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.610
 I know how many gauchos they will have in the 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.440
 guild so the team knows that changed a 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.500
 few references, how do I have it? 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.480
 a lot of outsiders but I do not know only 2010 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.430
 It's already been a long time since he 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.010
 Do you know what village things are like? 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.870
 so he already knows how it works 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.980
 together with the reference in our 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.290
 If find it interesting that he 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.420
 achieved this leadership during the 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.040
 their time did not arrive smiling him 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.480
 was not placed as leader as a decree 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.400
 game between science and captain 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.480
 for a few years yes but he was 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.400
 growing 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.080
 he was struck by the leadership 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.390
 important players came out in the middle of 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:24.210
 2010 and moved away and is a reference 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.980
 technique where the play itself 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.530
 Arrival video of him on the list to be 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.840
 about the oldest player on the 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:34.350
 grelo marcelo grohe who does not have this 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.480
 name is more difficult if you have a 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.580
 group game a face that 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.370
 I had a considerable time, I do not 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.740
 would have stood out could he 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.540
 I would know what an example is the 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.060
 The palm fronds were strange weather 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.640
 Do you know where he went from Sao Paulo? 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.910
 as he will want the dunga he does not 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.139
 only the italian team 's goal I'm going to pick up 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.060
 the example 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:58.949
 this does not always know the reference 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.469
 technique will be the lead gives the example 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:03.479
 but it's easier 94 cup 

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:05.699
 the technical reference romario the leadership 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.830
 of the group the 70 carlo bertolini and 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:10.590
 finally the team sometimes are sometimes 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:13.169
 I feel your crack does not have the spirit of 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.539
 office football books much more and 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:17.699
 This makes it easy and I'm 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:19.259
 first video that the international 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:20.539
 posted here at the time was released by 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:22.979
 press on d'alessandro arrival 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:24.300
 alecsandro entering the area after the 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:26.009
 signing of contract in the locker room 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.449
 greeting one by one and had a 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:29.460
 different player profile 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:31.529
 already in that attitude he already in the arrival in the 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:35.210
 first lyre act and I think that with 

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:35.210
 the time was to contribute it can be
