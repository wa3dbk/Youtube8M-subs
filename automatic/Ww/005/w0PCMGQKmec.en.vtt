00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.709
 f 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.040
 hello dear friends whole 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.830
 program builders build and so we 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.580
 keep telling you under 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.780
 construction of wooden houses 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.500
 Moscow region will remind you that in one of our 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.720
 past issues 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.119
 we visited one of the private ones 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.109
 developers Maxim Lebedeva inspecting the house 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:26.449
 made conclusions all last requires 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:28.340
 great work needed again 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.710
 cover the whole load with new paint 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.669
 interfloor overlappings and much 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.489
 much more however which ones 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:35.949
 to mount interfloor 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:38.159
 overlap in the house maxim did not know and 

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:39.870
 asked us to tell about it 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.210
 This topic was recommended to us and 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.730
 others to myself the viewer in their letters and we with 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.600
 pleasure we carry your 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.620
 wishes 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.850
 vbd so the main error during installation 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.350
 telecritic is and use in 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.680
 sound quality isolator 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.190
 mineral baths two first mineral 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.520
 cotton wool is essentially not good 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.729
 sound score 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:04.519
 secondly using it 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.159
 undesirable inside the dwelling she 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.130
 able to emit a mass of microparticles 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.009
 falling on aging falls 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:13.150
 human writer system 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.200
 also with improper installation 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.760
 wooden floor flooring 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.210
 begins to tremble which of course overshadows 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.520
 living a wooden house about how this 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.880
 avoid find out right now 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.010
 n 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.470
 cube 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.340
 25 percent 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.340
 sometimes you listen to the tape 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.300
 what is the beginning of the diocese season like 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.770
 reports ria east media was refused 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.860
 appeal is now necessary 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.290
 probably start with the fact that we are 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.130
 to the second floor of the house 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.920
 but then it will succeed interfloor 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.469
 overlap m 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:52.880
 however not the first floor we are 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.890
 standing on the shelf 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.890
 as if the second floor 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.240
 which pass as well 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.370
 garbage is actually excluded 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.680
 from the same this is a wall case 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.450
 This is the department of the custody of the worn out 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.529
 tree and struganova 

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:13.529
 true 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:15.299
 beams 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.299
 and so we get structure 

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:22.029
 lattice so by which water which 

00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:22.979
 does 

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:24.180
 30 from the square 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.539
 there is not much weight above this 

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:28.479
 I'm the same 

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:31.439
 as if we were on concrete 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:32.919
 all grounds 

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:34.379
 usual morning is wooden 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.309
 house building so that 

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:39.519
 people save on overlap or not 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.519
 make them solve reading 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.279
 and when you go out that's what exactly it is 

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:46.209
 division is nice 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.769
 where exactly the same price 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.399
 and the second problem 

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:52.949
 instead of the same is covered from wood 

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:55.699
 soundproofing floors of each other a lot 

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:57.249
 often when you're on the second 

00:02:57.249 --> 00:02:57.820
 heard 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.820
 so I like that after m yes 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.230
 however in the second case so 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.379
 TV works 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:05.889
 so here 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:08.689
 This question is solved in general, then you always 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:10.799
 was decided 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.409
 so that 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:14.589
 in old houses 

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:17.259
 even the boat stone buildings doctor was not 

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:19.019
 concrete floor slabs on faces 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:19.869
 no 

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:21.779
 helper trimmed wooden too 

00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:24.179
 overlap 

00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:26.169
 this space has come through 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:29.129
 either sand and a successful back statement 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.400
 I do not exclude that there were no dry leaves 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.989
 adjacent to the sand 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.680
 this is the hard work of communication systems i believe in 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.979
 what sound 

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:40.949
 doesn't really miss the masses 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:42.679
 that's all is 

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:43.969
 at its best 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:46.449
 yes we do not miss the sound 

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:48.699
 because sand he 

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:50.129
 are themselves 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.159
 so heavy 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:55.509
 uefa over turn out 

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:56.659
 seagulls everywhere 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:59.079
 and here if we portrayed the sound from below 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.459
 itâ€™s like we paid am 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:02.589
 shake 

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:04.619
 and so it seems 

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:06.729
 and many sound vibrations are like 

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:08.729
 mechanical energy moving out 

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:10.229
 Kakhovsky stuck writing 

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:11.839
 there is no such sound 

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:13.669
 European growth 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:16.139
 Here are the grains of sand 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:17.389
 way 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.039
 acoustic they come in 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:20.449
 mechanical 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:22.689
 well almost blind in the sand 

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:24.159
 shaking rooms 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:26.099
 cause descendant as the radio reports 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.840
 freedom a thousandth 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.840
 may be degrees Celsius 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.259
 the task is now at work 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:36.039
 in fact 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:37.779
 wake up sinus aggregate 

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:39.889
 the fact is that here you will become now on 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:41.520
 post and surnames 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.300
 these are my plywood 20 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.719
 two millimeters 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:47.549
 and she screwed on the screws 

00:04:47.549 --> 00:04:50.159
 special varese wood do not forget 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:51.710
 when we work with wood 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.680
 take advantage declared this victory 22 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.289
 April 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:56.789
 millimeter thick enough 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:59.520
 in order to stand for example on 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.169
 50 70 kilograms of this sand 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:05.900
 per square meter is an elephant true 3 5 a 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.039
 maybe more centimeters 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:09.470
 and this tournament 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.350
 Is it possible to put it safely because we 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.949
 in fact, the authorities will resort to the authorities 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:17.569
 and then screwed plane screw 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:19.029
 wood quota 

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:21.139
 they differ from ordinary screws in order 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:23.199
 what is their distance 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:24.639
 besides that 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:26.059
 grooves 

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:27.289
 much more 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:30.469
 someone that has a tree 

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:33.349
 as noted by the walls and we are in order 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:35.889
 to keep his Siberia well, they do not 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:37.779
 often need the ranks of the second such 

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:38.870
 thickness were not 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.600
 here impacted rent 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.100
 that's of such magnitude maybe even 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.069
 more this house form go out to samara 

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:47.240
 but not so expensive to 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.879
 generally use everywhere 

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:50.860
 that's the way we have plywood to them 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.089
 decent but screws 

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:54.999
 and here it is to endure 

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:56.569
 spaces 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:05:59.809
 percentage emissions hand delivery 

00:05:59.809 --> 00:06:01.800
 and now we take 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.400
 Veraka the second 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.650
 Igor and assign ask he 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.509
 and see 

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:10.559
 worth doing it 

00:06:10.559 --> 00:06:12.599
 and you over the whole 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:14.480
 man wakes up all ask 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.669
 mostly it's nothing here however 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:19.969
 just to bank 

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:21.659
 no sand 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:23.700
 lower on the floor because 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.300
 otherwise 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.230
 trite 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.550
 t.satylganova camp votes 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.729
 plywood will also be lying here 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:32.690
 empty field 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.690
 25 and maybe even 30 millimeters 

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:40.499
 and there will be us emptiness 

00:06:40.499 --> 00:06:43.030
 however back all Lebedev 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.750
 like any building this building has no 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.520
 only cons but a number of obvious advantages 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.370
 special jacks are provided 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.449
 with which you can lift or 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:54.759
 lower parts of the house when releasing wood 

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:56.370
 well, the material itself is enough 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.860
 dried and besides secondary painting and 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.050
 does not require additional 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:01.990
 processing 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.160
 besides this house was used 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.990
 ordinary wooden windows which are in nothing 

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:08.190
 not inferior newfangled 

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.780
 double-glazed unit landlord initially 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.940
 tried to make the house harmonious 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.819
 fit into the surrounding landscape 

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:16.969
 however statistics in artificial 

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:19.819
 materials it seems it was quite possible 

00:07:19.819 --> 00:07:22.939
 all my life I would like to have 200 built long ago 

00:07:22.939 --> 00:07:24.930
 dollars each 

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.600
 demi moore next second when mom 

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.479
 burglaries he was then announced in this 

00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:31.639
 year 

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:34.340
 the house is also data not that it is wooden 

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.680
 Oscar statuette of flawed manat 

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.930
 we touched on the subject block in this house i 

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:40.469
 asked our regular expert 

00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:42.659
 Andrei Vlasov tell you 

00:07:42.659 --> 00:07:44.800
 Dear viewers more about these 

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.150
 peculiar eyes
