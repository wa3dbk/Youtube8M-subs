00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
having to hit something to do so there's

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.660 
having to hit something to do so there's
three<00:00:19.050> motions<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:19.920> need<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.220> learn<00:00:20.369> in<00:00:20.580> order

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
three motions you need to learn in order

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.939 
three motions you need to learn in order
to<00:00:20.880> get<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.090> bunny<00:00:21.240> hop<00:00:21.390> down<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.869> first<00:00:22.769> of

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
to get the bunny hop down the first of

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.590 
to get the bunny hop down the first of
which<00:00:23.039> is<00:00:23.100> just<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.490> basic<00:00:23.880> pulling<00:00:24.300> up<00:00:24.420> on

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
which is just the basic pulling up on

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.420 
which is just the basic pulling up on
the<00:00:24.689> handlebars<00:00:25.019> you<00:00:25.680> can<00:00:25.830> learn<00:00:25.949> this<00:00:26.189> just

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
the handlebars you can learn this just

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.890 
the handlebars you can learn this just
in<00:00:26.519> any<00:00:26.699> other<00:00:26.880> car<00:00:27.090> park<00:00:27.359> which<00:00:27.630> we're<00:00:27.779> going

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
in any other car park which we're going

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.960 
in any other car park which we're going
to<00:00:27.960> demonstrate<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.470> in<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.619> minute<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.699> next

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
to demonstrate to in a minute the next

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.150 
to demonstrate to in a minute the next
motion<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.510> pulling<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.289> whole<00:00:31.500> bike<00:00:31.800> clean

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
motion is pulling the whole bike clean

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.160 
motion is pulling the whole bike clean
off<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.520> ground<00:00:32.759> this<00:00:33.149> isn't<00:00:33.480> concentrating

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
off the ground this isn't concentrating

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.229 
off the ground this isn't concentrating
so<00:00:34.350> much<00:00:34.380> on<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:35.250> full<00:00:35.460> motion<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.059> bunny

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
so much on the full motion of the bunny

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.490 
so much on the full motion of the bunny
hop<00:00:36.360> it's<00:00:36.570> just<00:00:36.750> getting<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.020> feeling<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.380> the

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
hop it's just getting the feeling of the

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.319 
hop it's just getting the feeling of the
bike<00:00:37.649> down<00:00:37.860> weightless<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.670> what<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.969> do<00:00:39.090> that

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
bike down weightless and what to do that

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.810 
bike down weightless and what to do that
the<00:00:39.960> final<00:00:40.350> motion<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.010> full<00:00:41.190> scoop<00:00:41.550> we

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
the final motion is the full scoop we

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.779 
the final motion is the full scoop we
also<00:00:41.969> get<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.180> bite<00:00:42.390> clean<00:00:42.750> off<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.140> ground<00:00:43.789> the

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
also get a bite clean off the ground the

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.369 
also get a bite clean off the ground the
scooping<00:00:45.180> motion<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.750> get<00:00:45.960> your<00:00:45.989> feet

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
scooping motion that you get your feet

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.500 
scooping motion that you get your feet
is<00:00:46.559> one<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.860> good<00:00:47.039> moves<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.579> help<00:00:48.120> aid<00:00:48.329> the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
is one of the good moves to help aid the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.410 
is one of the good moves to help aid the
rear<00:00:48.690> wheel<00:00:48.840> off<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:48.989> ground<00:00:49.110> as<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.890> do<00:00:50.039> this

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
rear wheel off the ground as to do this

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.000 
rear wheel off the ground as to do this
as<00:00:51.420> you're<00:00:51.660> taking<00:00:51.989> off<00:00:52.110> you're<00:00:52.649> effectively

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
as you're taking off you're effectively

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.459 
as you're taking off you're effectively
just<00:00:53.280> pushing<00:00:53.699> back<00:00:53.910> on<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.329> foot<00:00:54.510> right<00:00:55.350> and

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
just pushing back on the foot right and

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.139 
just pushing back on the foot right and
you<00:00:55.530> can<00:00:55.710> see<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.039> if<00:00:56.219> I'm<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.520> bat<00:00:56.730> break<00:00:57.000> on

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
you can see this if I'm a bat break on

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.970 
you can see this if I'm a bat break on
so<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.570> rear<00:00:57.780> wheel<00:00:57.930> doesn't<00:00:58.079> move<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.859> can

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
so that rear wheel doesn't move you can

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.380 
so that rear wheel doesn't move you can
see<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.129> can<00:00:59.309> just<00:00:59.430> pull<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.699> back<00:00:59.850> wheel<00:01:00.030> off

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
see I can just pull the back wheel off

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.369 
see I can just pull the back wheel off
the<00:01:00.449> ground<00:01:00.570> by<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.649> it's<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.129> same

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
the ground by that it's the same

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.380 
the ground by that it's the same
effective<00:01:04.379> technique<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:04.979> we<00:01:05.129> go<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:05.939> do<00:01:06.210> this

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
effective technique so we go to do this

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:15.010 
effective technique so we go to do this
you<00:01:06.540> push<00:01:06.930> back

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.990

you're<00:01:49.320> going<00:01:49.460> obviously<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.580> faster<00:01:51.000> you're

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
you're going obviously the faster you're

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.700 
you're going obviously the faster you're
going<00:01:51.330> the<00:01:51.750> further<00:01:51.990> back<00:01:52.170> you're<00:01:52.470> gonna<00:01:52.560> have

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
going the further back you're gonna have

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.160 
going the further back you're gonna have
to<00:01:52.830> hop<00:01:53.010> in<00:01:53.220> order<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.640> clear<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.030> stick<00:01:54.270> it's

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
to hop in order to clear the stick it's

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.420 
to hop in order to clear the stick it's
this<00:01:55.260> sort<00:01:55.440> of<00:01:55.530> thing<00:01:55.620> that<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.890> can<00:01:56.010> practice

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
this sort of thing that you can practice

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.730 
this sort of thing that you can practice
for<00:01:56.640> hours<00:01:57.060> in<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.300> car<00:01:57.480> park<00:01:57.540> maybe<00:01:58.050> white

can give up something like this and you

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.699 
can give up something like this and you
get<00:02:56.670> over<00:02:56.820> most<00:02:57.060> things<00:02:57.300> on<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.510> trail<00:02:57.750> again

and they're away from traffic it's an
ideal<00:03:02.250> spot<00:03:02.370> to<00:03:02.520> learn<00:03:02.850> so<00:03:03.510> I'm<00:03:03.630> just<00:03:03.750> going<00:03:03.870> to

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
ideal spot to learn so I'm just going to

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.860 
ideal spot to learn so I'm just going to
demonstrate<00:03:04.140> how<00:03:04.590> easy<00:03:04.800> it<00:03:04.980> is<00:03:05.070> just<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.840> get<00:03:06.840> a

okay<00:03:28.400> so<00:03:29.440> demonstrated<00:03:30.440> out<00:03:30.590> it's<00:03:30.860> pretty

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
okay so demonstrated out it's pretty

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.320 
okay so demonstrated out it's pretty
easy<00:03:31.340> to<00:03:31.490> get<00:03:31.670> up<00:03:31.820> something<00:03:32.090> like<00:03:32.120> this

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
easy to get up something like this

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.660 
easy to get up something like this
nothing<00:03:33.140> a<00:03:33.200> little<00:03:33.290> bit<00:03:33.470> more<00:03:33.560> confident<00:03:34.070> just

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
nothing a little bit more confident just

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.370 
nothing a little bit more confident just
happens<00:03:35.030> to<00:03:35.090> be<00:03:35.120> a<00:03:35.180> little<00:03:35.330> stream<00:03:35.630> here<00:03:35.840> so<00:03:36.140> i

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
happens to be a little stream here so i

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.260 
happens to be a little stream here so i
try<00:03:37.220> my<00:03:37.250> luck<00:03:37.490> and<00:03:37.640> see<00:03:37.760> if<00:03:37.820> i<00:03:37.910> get<00:03:38.000> over<00:03:38.150> the

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
try my luck and see if i get over the
