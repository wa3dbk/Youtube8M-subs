00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.040
 yes that obviously we all start from scratch 

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:08.880
 so we have to prepare ourselves from the best 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:13.530
 way to be able to fight the post 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.690
 so that I do not coach new command 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.060
 we have new people so give everything 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.699
 obviously we are not going to go 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.619
 this new year so start from the 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.630
 better way with with the right foot as 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.509
 it says and well this year we want 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.809
 understand what a rematch is here 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:33.420
 when one obviously when one has not 

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:35.609
 done a good previous tournament out there not 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.070
 be champion is obviously not this year is 

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:40.829
 for all we have not been left is 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.989
 a rematch to be able this this year 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.629
 go out in leaving champion and at the end of the year 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.160
 by the turn that is obviously no no no 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.769
 it's an excuse, no, it's not an excuse 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.679
 past tells me that I perfectly know that 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:55.159
 I did not do the preseason but but good 

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:57.690
 today you will no longer be able to see complaints so 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:59.819
 everything started from scratch so nothing is 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.239
 to fight and fight the position that is 

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:02.519
 hard 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.800
 you obviously this loin and I what 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:08.590
 I know with many younger years so 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.750
 and if I have to play for being a duo with 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.330
 I know this one perfectly and he says 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.560
 read them juan or if it is obviously 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.590
 obviously this one 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.780
 it's something very motivating 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.939
 what he has achieved in Garcilazo 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.100
 also because he could not win 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:26.439
 but but good now it's in its 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.710
 that in his house so I support him so that 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:32.530
 so that everything is on the court 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.560
 and everything for the canvas I have always 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.600
 imagined that the fans can 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.539
 scream my goal more than anything new to the 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.179
 that can be given this year and nothing to 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:45.759
 that we aim golden not yet has not 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:47.030
 been so so clear still not yet 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.290
 is 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.540
 is obviously moving the pieces 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.070
 to understand the movement that he 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.130
 wants the approach of what is going to 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.320
 be 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.590
 and well I imagine that in the trip to 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:05.539
 Spain will be clearer and more concise 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.539
 to get your ideas
