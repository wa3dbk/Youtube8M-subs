00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:08.069
 hello everyone I'm adri and today good after 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.440
 this time I bring you the eighth chapter 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.959
 of mythical terra has advanced some 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.160
 how many things about Greece and nothing else 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:16.160
 say so we started 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.660
 well you've seen in a raid 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.570
 of the titan and the et and area that is already 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:30.060
 done finished now I will pass like this for 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.669
 see it a few more details 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.770
 and another more important thing is the 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.579
 parthenon that is the temple of 500 in 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.260
 mythical terra that also in addition to some 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.019
 that other 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.390
 well silly web detail let's see if 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:49.390
 we still think we're going to start with the 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:53.890
 simulator that good 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:56.559
 Signs attraction plus gravel is a 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.000
 Access look at how cool the infra quartz 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:02.489
 this is super good I was wearing it 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.489
 hoping good more indications 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.250
 this is clear to me that to put 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.250
 torch posters 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.369
 good and here the attraction begins 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.159
 I have not entered for a while but I think 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.369
 there was a library and if I do not put it 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.870
 because I'm cool so I put the lights 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:33.900
 different is 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.900
 little heads of wade and something else 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.780
 another door 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.890
 and that's the simulator there's no better 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.890
 if there is something else but what 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.659
 I've done with a few mechanisms of 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.030
 redd stones light so you can 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.590
 turn on and off and that has stuck 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.970
 a little 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.530
 and also good 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.780
 and now I'm going to teach from where 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.780
 controls that and a little above the 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.940
 the breath because I can not 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.900
 impose movies or anything 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.900
 illumination 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:18.360
 Beijing that light is the door that would have 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.360
 to be closed and I'll invent something 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.090
 and now the important thing is the seats 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.650
 beige that were 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.879
 A) Yes 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.879
 they go down and up 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.989
 and they go back down and go up again 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.620
 that nothing can be done and what is 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.540
 the simulator practically 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.250
 and this is 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.650
 and it remains to cover the hole this 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.290
 was using for the mechanism is 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.390
 down here all 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.560
 and I have to solve that of these two 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.890
 lights because I do not know what he could 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.890
 happen 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.540
 good and this door opens also and 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.800
 we went out here to the east promenade 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.140
 can illuminate also 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.030
 and now we are going to 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:08.250
 This will add a new Video I think 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:12.980
 I did not know if this happened, it gives you a 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:16.120
 wagon like that for free 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.860
 the station is a bit shabby clear 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.110
 the exit has put him so that only 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.010
 can enter through the entrance there was not a 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.010
 clear output 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.410
 and well I have to say that adapted the 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.990
 traction 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.480
 because I like it more so what happens 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.850
 in the sidewinder this here and the turn 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.860
 to do it on top of where you enter 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.690
 here 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.480
 what I do a little more here 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.520
 that I have adapted it and that you know it 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:47.900
 do not tell me if someone sees this 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:50.310
 I doubt it's wrong that I'm 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.530
 so let's see 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.930
 let's go to the station what I've done 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.420
 completely new is this glass 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.489
 here and there is what the hotel will be 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.489
 from Greece the beginning that is 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:05.670
 making ginés that also came out in another 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:08.560
 video and well so nothing else the station 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.720
 titanic 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.050
 and this if you saw it and if I 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.810
 I would ask and what something 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.239
 I've done with a mechanism like the one where 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:21.049
 There is the other train 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.840
 that by another mechanism activates it 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.610
 from within the 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.190
 of the booth is the change via 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.040
 transport and that's why you can climb that train 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.340
 or out there 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.169
 it's two yellow chests is what 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.029
 would come to be 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.680
 what you have to keep while you 

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:39.550
 you raise the delation you can pay to give the 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.480
 backpacks and that 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.480
 and the output 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:51.570
 so titanic also finished 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:54.340
 but tel to the Greek I did not like to 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:57.169
 the best the entrance here 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:01.700
 what the fuck 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:05.050
 nothing is worth nothing unforeseen at the last minute 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.050
 I have not seen anything worth 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.900
 I suppose our teleports to each 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.490
 one of the hotels that I do not like 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.060
 I prefer to do stairs but I know 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.550
 will discuss that 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:18.070
 and now I'm going to Egypt for a moment 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.950
 I think it teaches us how it was aired 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:23.250
 to walk a villager and how handsome as 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.250
 nothing 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.639
 well here while I fight with the kit 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.580
 is said 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:33.090
 this is the thread 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.090
 Oh 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.910
 we go down 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.320
 it stays a little better 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.850
 how many I die in here 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:50.770
 and it would come to what it is 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.770
 if it leaves me 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.480
 this 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.660
 is the bathroom area a truth that has 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:01.569
 position of these last years with 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:04.590
 shifters like that all chulito 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:08.220
 a few showers 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:10.600
 and I suppose if someone is so attentive 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:13.090
 what makes mythical terra 'new 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.980
 you have to know 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:18.240
 and has put a whole area of ​​water by the 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:20.550
 nile river that with slides and all that 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.950
 what will I try to do or not I already know 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:25.070
 we will see 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:28.449
 and I'm going to see if I have something more to see 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:31.169
 I forgot that in titanic 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:34.539
 if you can done the ladders you're 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:36.930
 today around here if you want to get there you will be 

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:36.930
 a little 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:44.000
 here would be the emergency platform 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:46.069
 and where is the lightning rod that 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.750
 you know is the lightning rod of the park and 

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:49.610
 I think we go 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:53.700
 and there it is seen from above the labyrinth 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:55.710
 of the minotaur in the little forest and 

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:59.730
 I 'm doing very well I'm staying 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:03.160
 mholongo and well I have many details 

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:06.490
 although finishing like this 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:09.940
 and I do not know what else to say that good like 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:12.400
 subscribe and good thing is that I like 

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:14.500
 follow the series any suggestion 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.630
 you can tell me in the 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:19.270
 comments and the twitter that I will leave 

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:21.330
 out there maybe I do not know and well many 

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:24.480
 thanks for watching me and nothing else so 

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.480
 see you later
