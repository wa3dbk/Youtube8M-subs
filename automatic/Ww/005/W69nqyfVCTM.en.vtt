hi<00:00:16.410> I'm<00:00:16.950> Daryl<00:00:17.370> Canada<00:00:18.320> once<00:00:19.320> you<00:00:19.500> have<00:00:19.680> built

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:19.950 
hi I'm Daryl Canada once you have built

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.820 
hi I'm Daryl Canada once you have built
a<00:00:20.070> couple<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.490> putt-putt<00:00:20.730> boats<00:00:21.830> builders

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.769 
a couple of putt-putt boats builders
often<00:00:23.250> start<00:00:23.550> wondering<00:00:24.060> which<00:00:24.450> boat<00:00:24.750> is

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
often start wondering which boat is

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.320 
often start wondering which boat is
faster<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.710> which<00:00:26.220> engine<00:00:26.700> develops<00:00:27.119> the

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
faster and which engine develops the

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.730 
faster and which engine develops the
most<00:00:27.510> force<00:00:29.810> speed<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:31.080> pretty<00:00:31.260> easy<00:00:31.590> to

is<00:00:56.339> more<00:00:56.940> difficult<00:00:57.500> here's<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.739> method<00:00:59.129> I

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
is more difficult here's the method I

but<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.840> did<00:01:10.020> work<00:01:10.729> later<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.880> bought<00:01:12.210> two<00:01:12.510> gram

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
but it did work later I bought two gram

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.750 
but it did work later I bought two gram

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
90 grams or 1 ounce and 3 ounces I also

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.080 
90 grams or 1 ounce and 3 ounces I also
built<00:01:24.390> an<00:01:24.630> adjustable<00:01:25.320> raft<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:26.550> I<00:01:26.580> could<00:01:26.850> test

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
built an adjustable raft so I could test

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.960 
built an adjustable raft so I could test
engines<00:01:27.690> without<00:01:28.230> a<00:01:28.470> boat

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.570 

here<00:01:31.570> is<00:01:31.720> a<00:01:31.750> close-up<00:01:32.110> of<00:01:32.500> the<00:01:32.680> 3<00:01:32.890> ounce<00:01:33.070> scale

here is a close-up of the 3 ounce scale

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.810 
here is a close-up of the 3 ounce scale
I<00:01:33.940> put<00:01:34.930> a<00:01:34.960> card<00:01:35.260> on<00:01:35.440> the<00:01:35.590> scale<00:01:35.890> calibrated<00:01:36.700> the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
I put a card on the scale calibrated the

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.420 
I put a card on the scale calibrated the
same<00:01:37.060> as<00:01:37.210> a<00:01:37.240> scale<00:01:37.660> so<00:01:38.410> would<00:01:38.680> show<00:01:38.950> up<00:01:39.130> when

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
same as a scale so would show up when

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.830 
same as a scale so would show up when
taking<00:01:39.850> video<00:01:41.850> here<00:01:42.850> are<00:01:43.030> some<00:01:43.300> video<00:01:43.600> clips

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840

of the boats running in the tank
photographing<00:01:47.380> it<00:01:47.500> means<00:01:47.740> that<00:01:48.070> can<00:01:48.250> be<00:01:48.400> more

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
photographing it means that can be more

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.990 
photographing it means that can be more
accurate<00:01:49.240> in<00:01:49.420> measuring<00:01:50.170> both<00:01:50.440> force<00:01:50.830> and

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000
