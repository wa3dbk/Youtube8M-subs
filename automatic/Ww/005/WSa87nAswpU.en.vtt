to<00:03:33.980> be<00:03:34.100> just<00:03:34.310> like<00:03:34.460> fate<00:03:34.640> zero<00:03:34.910> it<00:03:35.150> could

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
to be just like fate zero it could

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.480 
to be just like fate zero it could
possibly<00:03:35.840> even<00:03:36.110> be<00:03:36.410> better<00:03:36.800> and<00:03:37.160> it<00:03:37.280> was<00:03:37.370> very

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490 
possibly even be better and it was very

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:38.890 
possibly even be better and it was very
smarter<00:03:37.910> than<00:03:38.030> to<00:03:38.180> do<00:03:38.300> it<00:03:38.390> this<00:03:38.510> way<00:03:38.660> as<00:03:38.720> well

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
smarter than to do it this way as well

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.840 
smarter than to do it this way as well
give<00:03:39.080> this<00:03:39.230> episode<00:03:39.710> zero<00:03:40.040> so<00:03:40.400> we<00:03:40.550> can<00:03:40.580> kind<00:03:40.820> of

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
give this episode zero so we can kind of

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.610 
give this episode zero so we can kind of
get<00:03:40.940> the<00:03:41.090> perspective<00:03:41.630> of<00:03:41.750> Ren<00:03:41.990> and<00:03:42.200> then<00:03:42.440> next

get the perspective of Ren and then next

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.660 
get the perspective of Ren and then next
week<00:03:42.830> we're<00:03:42.950> going<00:03:43.040> to<00:03:43.100> go<00:03:43.220> over<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:43.490> same

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
week we're going to go over the same

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.580 
week we're going to go over the same
content<00:03:44.270> so<00:03:44.570> a<00:03:44.600> certain<00:03:44.900> degree<00:03:45.020> or<00:03:45.290> the<00:03:45.410> same

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
content so a certain degree or the same

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.320 
content so a certain degree or the same
timeline<00:03:45.860> so<00:03:46.280> I<00:03:46.310> say<00:03:46.580> but<00:03:46.910> it's<00:03:47.030> going<00:03:47.150> to<00:03:47.240> be

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
timeline so I say but it's going to be

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.390 
timeline so I say but it's going to be
in<00:03:47.450> Searles<00:03:47.870> perspective<00:03:48.410> and<00:03:48.560> it<00:03:48.860> while<00:03:49.220> it's

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
in Searles perspective and it while it's

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.220 
in Searles perspective and it while it's
still<00:03:49.640> the<00:03:49.790> same<00:03:50.030> time<00:03:50.420> or<00:03:50.720> whatever<00:03:50.870> what's

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
still the same time or whatever what's

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.660 
still the same time or whatever what's
happening<00:03:51.680> ultimately<00:03:52.220> it's<00:03:52.400> going<00:03:52.490> to<00:03:52.550> be

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
happening ultimately it's going to be

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.310 
happening ultimately it's going to be
different<00:03:52.820> events<00:03:53.209> because<00:03:53.480> they<00:03:53.630> only<00:03:53.990> cross

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
different events because they only cross

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.140 
different events because they only cross
paths<00:03:54.650> like<00:03:54.950> once<00:03:55.190> or<00:03:55.340> twice<00:03:55.520> so<00:03:55.910> you're<00:03:56.030> going

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
paths like once or twice so you're going

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.760 
paths like once or twice so you're going
to<00:03:56.180> get<00:03:56.270> more<00:03:56.480> obscures<00:03:56.959> ideals<00:03:57.350> and<00:03:57.560> kind<00:03:57.740> of

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 
to get more obscures ideals and kind of

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.010 
to get more obscures ideals and kind of
get<00:03:57.950> into<00:03:58.400> his<00:03:58.580> character<00:03:58.940> so<00:03:59.209> definitely<00:03:59.840> the
