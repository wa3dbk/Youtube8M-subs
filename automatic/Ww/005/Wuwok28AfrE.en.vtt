00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:08.670
 Hey guys 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.730
 It's okay to hear what I'm talking about here. 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.969
 I want to show you a program. 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.119
 I did with the help of the black cat 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.180
 I was making a new shell for 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.800
 save warm cbo is at night direct from 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.980
 pen drives nÃ© 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.220
 first the banana and then the pen drive 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:33.480
 and now the china point hitch el 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.440
 for him and save the acp or who 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.059
 pen drive 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:43.559
 I'll show you what works 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:45.890
 or draw here or pendrive connect my 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.890
 xbox 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:56.940
 The military baby, the invitation is a glory. 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:04.680
 for an hour you can see and I'll call 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:07.619
 now ready 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:12.840
 I called, let's hope he went into 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:17.460
 shelf pro not yet did not think it had 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.850
 chip is gaining momentum with the 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.850
 cpu 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.990
 ready now it has entered shell mode 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:34.630
 is super fast thanks to a spiral 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:37.450
 let's wait for the pendrive to start 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.570
 to flash this program automatically 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.950
 will turn the unit off when 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:49.960
 it ends then you do not need to 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:52.170
 worry is theoretically loading 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.099
 the floor screen 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.080
 takes a while when I do not have 

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:59.740
 network face connected to the router 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:05.130
 wait 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.130
 Pedro will start to blink. 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:18.499
 the staff is he is recording our 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.499
 I call the pen drive directly 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.819
 all 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:14.170
 I had hung up now and I'll get the pen. 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:14.170
 drive and I will connect the bc 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:26.370
 note today he carried open in the cpi 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:26.370
 what 's here 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:39.010
 You can see that the cpu is the same 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.010
 loaded on my ao g1 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:46.890
 This is it folks working for 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.890
 to improve is of ceni
