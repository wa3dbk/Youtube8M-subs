 iPod or iPhone standard 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.539

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.060

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.570

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.560

 Jamie Dornan's six arms 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.660
 which one can adjust 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.150
 depending on what you do 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.150
 it is also pivotable in all directions 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.590
 no problem 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.120
 I prefer it on the side 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.120
 I am determined a Mac 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.750

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.610
 blandish 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.610
 because who wants movies or something 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.340
 We can do it in every corner as well 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.340
 doing everything vertically vertically 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.620

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.390

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.290

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:14.319
 Lettering from Luxor 2 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.489
 where two funds of rock are outside 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.429
 and we have one 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:23.429

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:27.349

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.309

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:33.309
 say less data or Southeastern is through 

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:38.989
 that will all be very stable 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.969
 I have no concerns because you can just adjust 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:44.969
 and to leave that there for a long time 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:49.619

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.079
 if it wanted to buy 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:14.269
 that's what it's supposed to do 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.269
 and do not buy the vocals for the price of yourself 

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:20.869
 but at this point I would like to visit Luxor 2 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:22.969
