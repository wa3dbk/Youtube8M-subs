00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
I'm just doing a quick video what it is

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.000 
I'm just doing a quick video what it is
I've<00:00:05.250> just<00:00:05.279> built<00:00:05.759> a<00:00:06.089> 3d<00:00:09.080> dongle<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.380> Vodafone

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
I've just built a 3d dongle a Vodafone

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.010 
I've just built a 3d dongle a Vodafone
3G<00:00:11.790> dongle<00:00:12.650> this<00:00:13.650> is<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:13.920> older-style<00:00:14.280> one

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.020 
3G dongle this is the older-style one

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.260 
3G dongle this is the older-style one
it's<00:00:16.020> basically<00:00:16.320> exactly<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:17.010> same<00:00:17.220> but<00:00:18.119> the

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
it's basically exactly the same but the

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.880 
it's basically exactly the same but the
the<00:00:18.539> later<00:00:18.720> ones<00:00:19.050> that<00:00:19.230> they<00:00:19.320> come<00:00:19.470> with<00:00:19.500> three

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
the later ones that they come with three

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.140 
the later ones that they come with three
gig<00:00:20.070> of<00:00:20.220> data<00:00:20.369> but<00:00:20.730> they<00:00:20.930> expire<00:00:21.930> after<00:00:22.170> 30

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
gig of data but they expire after 30

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.330 
gig of data but they expire after 30
days<00:00:24.150> where<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.109> older<00:00:25.380> ones<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.980> comes<00:00:26.189> with

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
days where the older ones it comes with

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.210 
days where the older ones it comes with
a<00:00:26.430> gig<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.760> data<00:00:26.910> but<00:00:27.689> there's<00:00:27.869> no<00:00:28.019> I<00:00:28.710> think<00:00:29.099> if

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
a gig of data but there's no I think if

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.209 
a gig of data but there's no I think if
you<00:00:29.369> use<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.910> within<00:00:30.179> six<00:00:30.990> months<00:00:31.199> so<00:00:31.949> say<00:00:32.099> if

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
you use it within six months so say if

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.700 
you use it within six months so say if
you<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:32.610> have<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.090> don't<00:00:33.270> use<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.660> if<00:00:34.530> you

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
you you have it you don't use it if you

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.560 
you you have it you don't use it if you
use<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:35.130> on<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.309> fifth<00:00:35.550> month<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:36.329> just

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
use that on the fifth month you just

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.410 
use that on the fifth month you just
just<00:00:37.200> further<00:00:37.590> download<00:00:38.219> an<00:00:38.399> email<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:39.120> keeps

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
just further download an email it keeps

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.139 
just further download an email it keeps
it<00:00:39.600> active<00:00:40.129> so<00:00:41.129> sorry<00:00:41.460> I'm<00:00:41.640> just<00:00:41.820> pointing<00:00:41.969> at

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
it active so sorry I'm just pointing at

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.110 
it active so sorry I'm just pointing at
that<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.660> keeps<00:00:42.840> active<00:00:43.579> so<00:00:44.579> there's<00:00:44.760> no<00:00:44.879> time

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
that it keeps active so there's no time

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.060 
that it keeps active so there's no time
limit<00:00:45.329> on<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:45.930> so<00:00:46.079> which<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.530> really<00:00:46.559> good<00:00:46.920> so

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
limit on it so which is really good so

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.619 
limit on it so which is really good so
you<00:00:47.100> can<00:00:47.250> just<00:00:47.430> put<00:00:47.610> 15<00:00:47.969> quid<00:00:48.180> on<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.510> gives

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
you can just put 15 quid on it it gives

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.139 
you can just put 15 quid on it it gives
you<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.840> gig<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:50.070> it's<00:00:50.370> there's<00:00:50.670> no<00:00:50.789> time<00:00:51.030> limit

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
you a gig and it's there's no time limit

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.910 
you a gig and it's there's no time limit
which<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.570> ideal<00:00:51.899> for<00:00:51.930> something<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.649> need

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
which is ideal for something that I need

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.549 
which is ideal for something that I need
because<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:53.940> don't<00:00:54.420> really<00:00:54.600> use<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.230> much

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
because I don't really use it that much

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.380 
because I don't really use it that much
this<00:00:56.300> it's<00:00:57.300> been<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.570> occasional<00:00:59.120> times<00:01:00.120> when

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
this it's been the occasional times when

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.420 
this it's been the occasional times when
I've<00:01:00.480> needed<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:01.920> didn't<00:01:02.100> want<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.280> pay

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430

have at the top you've got connections
and<00:01:52.979> devices<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:54.860> it<00:01:55.860> was<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.250> simple<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:57.060> was

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
and devices and it was so simple it was

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.420 
and devices and it was so simple it was
like<00:01:57.360> hot<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.719> couple<00:01:58.049> of<00:01:58.110> clicks<00:01:58.350> no<00:01:58.710> like<00:01:59.189> real

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
like hot a couple of clicks no like real

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.120 
like hot a couple of clicks no like real
user<00:01:59.820> intervention<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:01.290> works<00:02:01.500> really

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
user intervention and it works really

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.190
