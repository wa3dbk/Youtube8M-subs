camp 97 we're certainly by transferring
the<00:00:08.370> energy<00:00:08.460> we're<00:00:09.150> up<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.840> level<00:00:10.139> of<00:00:10.380> the

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
the energy we're up to the level of the

third level of transferring the energy

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:19.099 
third level of transferring the energy
which<00:00:12.870> is<00:00:13.170> small<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.429> so<00:00:14.820> soft<00:00:15.240> fudging<00:00:18.109> when

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
which is small and so soft fudging when

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.480 
which is small and so soft fudging when
you<00:00:19.230> say<00:00:19.439> that<00:00:19.619> you<00:00:19.740> do<00:00:19.859> single<00:00:20.220> bit<00:00:20.340> from<00:00:20.460> the

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
you say that you do single bit from the

the<00:00:42.120> center<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:44.120> can<00:00:45.120> put<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.360> this<00:00:45.450> way<00:00:45.690> when

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
the center it I can put it this way when

second version the center makes the

second version the center makes the
hands<00:01:26.400> move<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:27.630> center<00:01:27.869> even<00:01:28.229> makes<00:01:28.409> the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
hands move the center even makes the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.069 
hands move the center even makes the
feet<00:01:28.799> move<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:30.060> all<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.299> didn't<00:01:30.689> put<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:30.869> on

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
feet move so all I didn't put that on

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.660 
feet move so all I didn't put that on
the<00:01:31.170> last<00:01:31.290> tape<00:01:31.619> i<00:01:31.770> was<00:01:31.890> going<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.189> remember<00:01:32.490> i

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
the last tape i was going to remember i

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.210 
the last tape i was going to remember i
forgot<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:33.750> when<00:01:33.930> you're<00:01:34.079> stepping<00:01:34.500> don't<00:01:35.100> you

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
forgot so when you're stepping don't you

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.899 
forgot so when you're stepping don't you
see<00:01:35.460> that's<00:01:35.750> slow<00:01:36.750> tai<00:01:37.110> chi<00:01:37.430> you<00:01:38.430> have<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.759> just

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
see that's slow tai chi you have to just

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.100 
see that's slow tai chi you have to just
step<00:01:39.180> with<00:01:39.299> your<00:01:39.420> foot<00:01:39.570> using<00:01:39.869> your<00:01:39.960> muscles

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
step with your foot using your muscles

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.370 
step with your foot using your muscles
when<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:40.860> want<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.070> step<00:01:41.280> using<00:01:41.549> its<00:01:42.380> its

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
when you want to step using its its

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.200 
when you want to step using its its
backbone<00:01:43.680> shaking<00:01:44.310> method<00:01:44.579> like<00:01:44.700> as<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:45.060> like

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
backbone shaking method like as a like

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.850 
backbone shaking method like as a like
to<00:01:45.329> call<00:01:45.479> all<00:01:45.630> moving<00:01:45.990> from<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.170> center<00:01:46.530> the

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
to call all moving from the center the

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.319 
to call all moving from the center the
center<00:01:47.159> causes<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.729> movement<00:01:48.119> in<00:01:48.180> other

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
center causes the movement in other

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.660 
center causes the movement in other
words<00:01:48.570> even<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.500> step<00:01:49.799> is<00:01:50.040> let<00:01:50.369> your<00:01:50.549> legs

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
words even the step is let your legs

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.969 
words even the step is let your legs
like<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.939> pendulum<00:01:51.360> now<00:01:52.020> if<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.530> just<00:01:52.740> pick<00:01:52.860> my

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
like a pendulum now if I just pick my

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.440 
like a pendulum now if I just pick my
leg<00:01:53.159> up<00:01:53.310> slow<00:01:53.759> be<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.909> little<00:01:54.090> bit<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.329> movement

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
leg up slow be a little bit of movement

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.780 
leg up slow be a little bit of movement
c<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:54.960> relax<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.710> but<00:01:56.189> I<00:01:56.280> want<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.520> make<00:01:56.670> to

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
c and relax it but I want to make to

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.880 
c and relax it but I want to make to
swing<00:01:57.119> out<00:01:57.299> so<00:01:57.930> I've<00:01:58.020> got<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.259> use<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.500> waist

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
swing out so I've got to use the waist

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.980 
swing out so I've got to use the waist
see<00:01:59.250> so<00:01:59.490> I'll<00:02:00.000> just<00:02:00.119> do<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.390> correctly<00:02:00.659> first

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
see so I'll just do it correctly first

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.020 
see so I'll just do it correctly first
and<00:02:01.290> explain<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.680> your<00:02:02.009> pick<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.280> leg<00:02:02.430> up<00:02:02.579> and

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.760 

see<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.390> looks<00:02:06.570> sloppy<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:07.170> that's<00:02:07.409> sloppy

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770

someone I used to know a lovely girl
with<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:19.950> full<00:02:20.220> slate<00:02:20.489> from<00:02:21.150> here<00:02:21.450> down<00:02:21.629> and<00:02:22.260> she

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
with a full slate from here down and she

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.229 
with a full slate from here down and she
used<00:02:22.650> to<00:02:22.739> always<00:02:22.769> walk<00:02:23.069> right<00:02:23.340> swinging<00:02:24.120> her

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
used to always walk right swinging her

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.600 
used to always walk right swinging her
waist<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:25.500> make<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.680> leg<00:02:25.920> go<00:02:26.099> forward<00:02:26.489> and

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
waist to make a leg go forward and

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.009 
waist to make a leg go forward and
that's<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:27.090> that's<00:02:27.629> a<00:02:27.720> good<00:02:27.810> analogy

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
that's that that's a good analogy

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.869 
that's that that's a good analogy
because<00:02:28.409> then<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:28.769> can<00:02:28.890> understand<00:02:29.250> how<00:02:29.819> you

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
because then you can understand how you

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.119 
because then you can understand how you
get<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.239> waist<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.659> actually<00:02:31.079> you<00:02:31.769> don't<00:02:31.890> go

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
get the waist to actually you don't go

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:35.149 
get the waist to actually you don't go
like<00:02:32.310> this<00:02:32.489> like<00:02:32.879> this<00:02:33.870> it's<00:02:34.620> just<00:02:34.860> a<00:02:34.950> very

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.159

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:39.859 
subtle thing of em and then same here

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:44.539 
subtle thing of em and then same here
mm-hmm<00:02:40.859> see<00:02:41.959> yeah<00:02:42.959> it<00:02:43.290> is<00:02:43.439> it's<00:02:43.680> like<00:02:44.099> in<00:02:44.220> space

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
mm-hmm see yeah it is it's like in space

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:49.430 
mm-hmm see yeah it is it's like in space
yes<00:02:44.939> like<00:02:45.239> that<00:02:46.040> you<00:02:47.040> want<00:02:47.750> you<00:02:48.750> have<00:02:48.959> to<00:02:49.200> you

this is it like you know when you're in
there<00:03:01.620> in<00:03:01.799> a<00:03:01.889> pouch<00:03:02.220> me<00:03:02.489> when<00:03:02.970> you<00:03:03.090> do<00:03:03.180> this

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
there in a pouch me when you do this

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:04.729

all you have to do it's like a spin
being<00:03:13.109> loaded<00:03:13.349> I<00:03:13.709> don't<00:03:14.129> then<00:03:14.280> have<00:03:14.459> to<00:03:14.579> go<00:03:14.810> in

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
being loaded I don't then have to go in

release<00:03:17.760> that<00:03:18.060> birth<00:03:18.540> potential<00:03:19.230> energy

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
release that birth potential energy

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.710 
release that birth potential energy
about<00:03:19.650> that<00:03:19.829> in<00:03:19.949> my<00:03:20.069> waist<00:03:20.370> close<00:03:21.090> to<00:03:21.299> my<00:03:21.449> legs

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
being in this position I've just got to

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.550 
being in this position I've just got to
release<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.209> energy<00:03:24.329> so<00:03:25.109> let<00:03:25.230> them<00:03:25.379> do<00:03:25.470> is

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
release the energy so let them do is

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.720 
release the energy so let them do is
pick<00:03:25.739> this<00:03:25.859> foot<00:03:26.069> up<00:03:26.190> off<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.400> ground<00:03:26.519> that's

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
pick this foot up off the ground that's

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.500 
pick this foot up off the ground that's
all<00:03:26.970> I've<00:03:27.120> got<00:03:27.269> to<00:03:27.299> do<00:03:27.569> oh<00:03:27.810> my<00:03:28.109> god<00:03:28.290> ah<00:03:29.449> when<00:03:30.449> I

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
haven't had to use any muscles because

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.420 
haven't had to use any muscles because
it's<00:03:32.190> like<00:03:32.400> releasing<00:03:32.790> a<00:03:33.949> spring<00:03:34.949> it's<00:03:35.280> like

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
it's like releasing a spring it's like

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.309 
it's like releasing a spring it's like
releasing<00:03:35.730> a<00:03:35.910> spring<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:36.389> it's<00:03:37.049> the<00:03:37.109> same

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
releasing a spring and it's the same

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.909 
releasing a spring and it's the same
here<00:03:37.769> I<00:03:37.949> don't<00:03:38.910> have<00:03:39.000> to<00:03:39.150> go<00:03:39.440> like<00:03:40.440> this<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.829> get

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919 
here I don't have to go like this to get

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:42.439 
here I don't have to go like this to get
the<00:03:41.069> step<00:03:41.310> because<00:03:41.579> I've<00:03:41.669> only<00:03:41.849> got<00:03:42.090> potential

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:42.449 
the step because I've only got potential

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:44.629 
the step because I've only got potential
energy<00:03:42.870> let's<00:03:42.989> eat<00:03:43.169> now<00:03:43.310> in<00:03:44.310> doing<00:03:44.549> this

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
energy let's eat now in doing this

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.960 
energy let's eat now in doing this
movement<00:03:44.940> here<00:03:46.190> there's<00:03:47.190> potential<00:03:47.639> energy

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
movement here there's potential energy

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.729 
movement here there's potential energy
of<00:03:48.000> my<00:03:48.150> waist<00:03:48.389> all<00:03:48.780> I<00:03:48.870> have<00:03:49.079> to<00:03:49.230> do<00:03:49.349> now<00:03:49.379> is

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
of my waist all I have to do now is

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.080
