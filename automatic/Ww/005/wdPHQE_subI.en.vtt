he's pushing his abs out now there's
another<00:02:43.769> variation<00:02:44.280> of<00:02:44.639> this<00:02:44.760> that<00:02:45.180> will<00:02:45.329> show

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
another variation of this that will show

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.929 
another variation of this that will show
you<00:02:45.540> now<00:02:45.810> this<00:02:46.379> is<00:02:46.500> more<00:02:46.650> of<00:02:46.709> a<00:02:46.859> knee<00:02:47.069> in<00:02:47.310> than<00:02:47.790> a

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:47.939 
you now this is more of a knee in than a

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:49.819 
you now this is more of a knee in than a
leg<00:02:48.120> race<00:02:48.359> but<00:02:48.750> still<00:02:49.019> does<00:02:49.200> essentially<00:02:49.650> the

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
leg race but still does essentially the

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.259 
leg race but still does essentially the

keeping the tension on the whole time

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.360 
keeping the tension on the whole time

them<00:03:02.909> tuned<00:03:03.180> up<00:03:03.239> because<00:03:03.449> they<00:03:03.540> tend<00:03:03.719> to

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
them tuned up because they tend to

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.449 
them tuned up because they tend to
recover<00:03:04.139> really<00:03:04.530> fast<00:03:04.799> compared<00:03:05.250> to<00:03:05.280> other

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
have a look at that chassis let's see

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.720 
have a look at that chassis let's see
the<00:03:09.359> six-pack<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:10.439> doms<00:03:10.739> built<00:03:11.069> through
